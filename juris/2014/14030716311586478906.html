				<BR><BR>It is in the hallowed grounds of a university where students, faculty, and research personnel should feel safest. After all, this is where ideas that could probably solve the sordid realities in this world are peacefully nurtured and debated. Universities produce hope. They incubate all our youthful dreams.<br><div align="JUSTIFY"><br>Yet, there are elements within this academic milieu that trade misplaced concepts of perverse brotherhood for these hopes. Fraternity rumbles exist because of past impunity. This has resulted in a senseless death whose justice is now the subject matter of this case. It is rare that these cases are prosecuted. It is even more extraordinary that there are credible witnesses who present themselves courageously before an able and experienced trial court judge.<br><br>This culture of impunity must stop. There is no space in this society for hooliganism disguised as fraternity rumbles. The perpetrators must stand and suffer the legal consequences of their actions. They must do so for there is an individual who now lies dead, robbed of his dreams and the dreams of his family. Excruciating grief for them will never be enough.<br><br>It is undisputed that on December 8, 1994, at around 12:30 to 1:00 in the afternoon, seven (7) members of the Sigma Rho fraternity were eating lunch at the Beach House Canteen, near the Main Library of the University of the Philippines, Diliman, when they were attacked by several masked men carrying baseball bats and lead pipes. Some of them sustained injuries that required hospitalization. One of them, Dennis Venturina, died from his injuries.<br><br>An information<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> for murder, docketed as Criminal Case No. Q95-61133, was filed against several members of the Scintilla Juris fraternity, namely, Danilo Feliciano, Jr., Julius Victor L. Medalla, Warren L. Zingapan, Robert Michael Beltran Alvir, Christopher L. Soliva, Reynaldo G. Ablanida, Carlo Jolette Fajardo, George Morano, Raymund E. Narag, Gilbert Merle Magpantay, Benedict Guerrero, and Rodolfo Peñalosa, Jr. with the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 219. The information reads:<br><br><blockquote>That on or about the 8<sup>th</sup> day of December 1994, in Quezon City, Philippines, the above-named accused, wearing masks and/or other forms of disguise, <b><i>conspiring, confederating with other persons</i></b> whose true names, identities and whereabouts have not as yet been ascertained, and mutually helping one another, with intent to kill, qualified with treachery, and with evident premeditation, taking advantage of superior strength, armed with baseball bats, lead pipes, and cutters, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and employ personal violence upon the person of DENNIS F. VENTURINA, by then and there hitting him on the head and clubbing him on different parts of his body thereby inflicting upon him serious and mortal injuries which were the direct and immediate cause of his death, to the damage and prejudice of the heirs of said DENNIS F. VENTURINA.

They were near the College of Arts and Sciences (Palma Hall) when he vaguely heard somebody shouting, “Rumble!” They went to the place where the alleged rumble was happening and saw injured men being helped by bystanders. They helped an injured person board the service vehicle of the Beach House Canteen. They asked what his name was, and he replied that he was Mervin Natalicio. When he asked Natalicio who hit him, the latter was not able to reply but instead told him that his attackers were wearing masks.

From there, he allegedly saw the whole incident. He testified that ten (10) men, wearing either masks of red and black bonnets or with shirts covering their faces, came from a red car parked nearby. He also saw three (3) men being hit with lead pipes by the masked men. Two (2) of the men fell after being hit. One of the victims was lifting the other to help him, but the attackers overtook him. Afterwards, the attackers ran away. He then saw students helping those who were injured. He likewise helped in carrying one of the injured victims, which he later found out to be Arnel Fortes.<br><br>A U.P. student and member of the Sigma Alpha Nu Sorority, Eda Panganiban,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> testified that she and her friends were in line to order lunch at the Beach House Canteen when a commotion happened. She saw around fifteen (15) to eighteen (18) masked men attack a group of Sigma Rhoans. She did not see any mask fall off. Her sorority sister and another U.P. student, Luz Perez,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> corroborated her story that the masked men were unrecognizable because of their masks. Perez, however, admitted that a member of Scintilla Juris approached her to make a statement.<br><br>Another sorority sister, Bathalani Tiamzon,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> testified on substantially the same matters as Panganiban and Perez.

She also stated that some of the men were wearing black masks while some were wearing white t-shirts as masks. She did not see any mask fall off the faces of the attackers.<br><br>According to Feliciana Feliciano,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> accused-appellant Danilo Feliciano, Jr.’s mother, her son was in Pampanga to visit his sick grandfather at the time of the incident.

He said that he could not have possibly been in U.P. on December 8, 1994 since he was absent even from work. He also testified that he wore glasses and, thus, could not have possibly been the person identified by Leandro Lachica. He also stated that he was not enrolled in U.P. at the time since he was working to support himself.<br><br>According to Julius Victor Medalla,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> he and another classmate, Michael Vibas, were working on a school project on December 8, 1994. He also claimed that he could not have participated in the rumble as he had an injury affecting his balance. The injury was caused by an incident in August 1994 when he was struck in the head by an unknown assailant. His testimony was corroborated by Jose Victor Santos<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> who stated that after lunch that day, Medalla played darts with him and, afterwards, they went to Jollibee.<br><br>Christopher Soliva,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> on the other hand, testified that he was eating lunch with his girlfriend and another friend in Jollibee, Philcoa, on December 8, 1994. They went back to U.P. before 1:00 p.m. and went straight to their fraternity hang-out where he was told that there had been a rumble at the Main Library. He also met several Sigma Rhoans acting suspiciously as they passed by the hang-out. They were also told by their head, Carlo Taparan, not to react to the Sigma Rhoans and just go home. Anna Cabahug,<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[98]</sup></font> his girlfriend, corroborated his story.<br><br>Warren Zingapan<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> also testified that he was not in U.P. at the time of the incident. He claimed to have gone to SM North to buy a gift for a friend’s wedding but ran into a fraternity brother. He also alleged that some Sigma Rhoans attacked them in SM North that day.<br><br>On February 28, 2002, the trial court rendered its decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> with the finding that Robert Michael Alvir, Danilo Feliciano, Jr., Christopher Soliva, Julius Victor Medalla, and Warren Zingapan were guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder and attempted murder and were sentenced to, among other penalties, the penalty of reclusion perpetua.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> The trial court, however, acquitted Reynaldo Ablanida, Carlo Jolette Fajardo, Gilbert Magpantay, George Morano, and Raymund Narag.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> The case against Benedict Guerrero was ordered archived by the court until his apprehension.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup><br><br>The trial court, in evaluating the voluminous evidence at hand, concluded that:<br><br><blockquote>After a judicious evaluation of the matter, the Court is of the considered view that of the ten accused, some were sufficiently identified and some were not. The Court believes that out of the amorphous images during the pandemonium, the beleaguered victims were able to espy and identify some of the attackers etching an indelible impression in their memory. In this regard, the prosecution eyewitnesses were emphatic that they saw the attackers rush towards them wielding deadly weapons like baseball bats, lead pipes, pieces of wood and bladed ones, and pounce on their hapless victims, run after them, and being present with one another at the scene of the crime during the assault. Although each victim had a very strong motive to place his fraternity rivals permanently behind bars, not one of them testified against all of them. If the prosecution eyewitnesses, who were all Sigma Rhoans, were simply bent on convicting Scintilla Juris members for that matter, they could have easily tagged each and every single accused as a participant in the atrocious and barbaric assault to make sure that no one else would escape conviction. Instead, each eyewitness named only one or two and some were candid enough to say that they did not see who delivered the blows against them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup></blockquote><br>Because one of the penalties meted out was reclusion perpetua, the case was brought to this court on automatic appeal.

The rationale for this was explained in<i> People v. Daniel Quijada,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Settled is the rule that the factual findings of the trial court, especially on the credibility of witnesses, are accorded great weight and respect. For, the trial court has the advantage of observing the witnesses through the different indicators of truthfulness or falsehood, such as the angry flush of an insisted assertion or the sudden pallor of a discovered lie or the tremulous mutter of a reluctant answer or the forthright tone of a ready reply; or the furtive glance, the blush of conscious shame, the hesitation, the sincere or the flippant or sneering tone, the heat, the calmness, the yawn, the sigh, the candor or lack of it, the scant or full realization of the solemnity of an oath, the carriage and mien.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup></blockquote><br>There are, of course, recognized exceptions to this rule. In <i>People v. Leticia Labarias,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup> this court stated that:<br><br><blockquote>It is the policy of this Court to sustain the factual findings of the trial court on the reasonable assumption that it is in a better position to assess the evidence before it, particularly the testimonies of the witnesses, who reveal much of themselves by their deportment on the stand. <b>The exception that makes the rule is where such findings are <i>clearly arbitrary or erroneous</i> as when they are <i>tainted with bias or hostility</i> or are <i>so lacking in basis</i> as to suggest that they were reached without the careful study and perceptiveness that should characterize a judicial decision.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>In criminal cases, the exception gains even more importance since the presumption is always in favor of innocence. It is only upon proof of guilt beyond reasonable doubt that a conviction is sustained.<br><br>In this case, a total of eleven (11) witnesses for the prosecution and forty-two (42) witnesses for the defense were put on the stand from 1995 to 2001. In an eighty-three (83)-page decision, the trial court acquitted six (6) and convicted five (5) of the accused. On the basis of these numbers alone, it cannot be said that the trial court acted arbitrarily or that its decision was “so lacking in basis” that it was arrived at without a judicious and exhaustive study of all the evidence presented.<br><br>Inasmuch, however, as the trial court’s findings hold great persuasive value, there is also nothing that precludes this court from coming to its own conclusions based on an independent review of the facts and the evidence on record.<br><br><b>The accused were sufficiently<br>identified by the witnesses for <br>the prosecution</b><br><br>The trial court, in weighing all the evidence on hand, found the testimonies of the witnesses for the prosecution to be credible. In its decision, the trial court stated that:<br><br><blockquote>x x x. Although each victim had a very strong motive to place his fraternity rivals permanently behind bars, not one testified against all of them. <b>If the prosecution eyewitnesses, who were all Sigma Rhoans, were simply bent on convicting Scintilla Juris members for that matter, they could have easily tagged each and every accused as a participant in the atrocious and barbaric assault to make sure no one would escape conviction. Instead, each eyewitness named only one or two and some were candid enough to say that they did not see who delivered the blows against them.</b><br><br>Thus, the prosecution witnesses, Ernest Paulo Tan, Dennis Gaio and Darwin Asuncion, testified to have seen it all but they could not, and did not, disclose any name. Lachica, on the other hand, said that he did not have the opportunity to see and identify the person who hit him in the back and inflicted a two-inch cut. His forearm was also hit by a lead pipe but he did not see who did it. Natalicio, one of the other three who were hospitalized, was severely beaten by three waves of attackers totalling more than 15 but he could only name 3 of them. He added, however, that he would be able to recognize those he saw if he would see them again. Of them, Mangrobang pointed to at least 5 but he stressed that he did not see Zingapan, Soliva, Guerrero, Del Rosario, Daraoay, Denoista, and Penalosa during the onslaught. Gaston could have named any of the accused as the one who repeatedly hit him with a heavy pipe and stabbed him but he frankly said their faces were covered. Like Natalicio, Fortes was repeatedly beaten by several groups but did not name any of the accused as one of those who attacked him. The persons he identified were those leading the pack with one of them as the assailant of Venturina, and the two others who he saw standing while he was running away. He added that he saw some of the accused during the attack but did not know then their names.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>We agree.<br><br>The trial court correctly held that “considering the swiftness of the incident,”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup> there would be slight inconsistencies in their statements. In <i>People v.

It has also been previously held that:<br><br><blockquote>It is the most natural reaction for victims of criminal violence to strive to see the looks and faces of their assailants and observe the manner in which the crime was committed.

It had been testified by the victims that some of the assailants were wearing masks of either a piece of cloth or a handkerchief and that Alvir,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup> Zingapan,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup> Soliva,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup> and Feliciano<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[133]</sup></font> had masks on at first but their masks fell off and hung around their necks. Equally telling was the testimony of defense witness Frisco Capilo during cross-examination who observed that some of the attackers were wearing masks and some were not, thus:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Q </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Mr. Capilo, do you know this Scintilla Juris Fraternity?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">No, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">During the incident of December 8, 1994, there were a lot of people eating in the Beach House Canteen, and then running towards different directions, is it not?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Yes, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">And some people were wearing masks and some were not?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Yes, sir.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>While the attack was swift and sudden, the victims would have had the presence of mind to take a look at their assailants if they were identifiable. Their positive identification, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, must be upheld to be credible.<br><br>It has been argued that the trial court did not give Mangrobang’s testimony credence while Gaston’s testimony was found to be “hazy.” This argument is unmeritorious.<br><br>It should be noted that it was the trial court itself that stated that the acquittal of the Scintilla Juris members identified by Mangrobang “should not be misinterpreted to mean that the testimony of Mangrobang was an absolute fabrication.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup> The court went on to state that they “were exonerated merely because they were accorded the benefit of the doubt as their identification by Mangrobang, under tumultuous and chaotic circumstances were [sic] not corroborated and their alibis, not refuted.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup>&nbsp; There was, therefore, no basis to say that Mangrobang was not credible; it was only that the evidence presented was not strong enough to overcome the presumption of innocence.<br><br>Gaston’s testimony, on the other hand, was considered “hazy”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup> by the trial court only with regard to his identification of Zingapan’s companion. Gaston testified that he saw Zingapan with Morano, with Zingapan moving and Morano staying in place. Fortes, however, testified that both Zingapan and Morano were running after him. Lachica also testified that it was Medalla, not Morano, who was with Zingapan. Because of this confusion, the trial court found that there was doubt as to who was really beside Zingapan. The uncertainty resulted into an acquittal for Morano. Despite this, the court still did not impute doubt in their testimonies that Zingapan was present at the scene.<br><br>Be that as it may, the acquittals made by the trial court further prove that its decision was brought about only upon a thorough examination of the evidence presented. It accepted that there were inconsistencies in the testimonies of the victims but that these were minor and did not affect their credibility. It ruled that “[s]uch inconsistencies, and even probabilities, are not unusual ‘for there is no person with perfect faculties or senses.’”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup><br><br><b>Evidence as part of the <i>res gestae</i><br>may be admissible but have little<br> persuasive value in this case </b><br><br>According to the testimony of U.P.

The Rules of Court, however, provide several exceptions to the general rule, and one of which is when the evidence is part of <i>res gestae,</i> thus:<br><br><blockquote>Section 42. <i>Part of res gestae.</i> — Statements made by a person while a starting occurrence is taking place or immediately prior or subsequent thereto with respect to the circumstances thereof, may be given in evidence as part of res gestae.

Rodrigo Salafranca</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[142]</sup> this court has previously discussed the admissibility of testimony taken as part of <i>res gestae</i>, stating that:<br><br><blockquote>A declaration or an utterance is deemed as part of the <i>res gestae </i>and thus admissible in evidence as an exception to the hearsay rule when the following requisites concur, to wit: (a) the principal act, the <i>res gestae,</i> is a startling occurrence; (b) the statements are made before the declarant had time to contrive or devise; and (c) the statements must concern the occurrence in question and its immediately attending circumstances.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The term <i>res gestae</i> has been defined as “those circumstances which are the undesigned incidents of a particular litigated act and which are admissible when illustrative of such act.” In a general way, <i>res gestae</i> refers to the circumstances, facts, and declarations that grow out of the main fact and serve to illustrate its character and are so spontaneous and contemporaneous with the main fact as to exclude the idea of deliberation and fabrication. The rule on <i>res gestae </i>encompasses the exclamations and statements made by either the participants, victims, or spectators to a crime immediately before, during, or immediately after the commission of the crime when the circumstances are such that the statements were made as a spontaneous reaction or utterance inspired by the excitement of the occasion and there was no opportunity for the declarant to deliberate and to fabricate a false statement. The test of admissibility of evidence as a part of the<i> res gestae</i> is, therefore, whether the act, declaration, or exclamation is so intimately interwoven or connected with the principal fact or event that it characterizes as to be regarded as a part of the transaction itself, and also whether it clearly negatives any premeditation or purpose to manufacture testimony.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[143]</sup></blockquote><br>There is no doubt that a sudden attack on a group peacefully eating lunch on a school campus is a startling occurrence. Considering that the statements of the bystanders were made immediately after the startling occurrence, they are, in fact, admissible as evidence given in<i> res gestae</i>.<br><br>In <i>People v. Albarido</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[144]</sup> however, this court has stated that “in accord to ordinary human experience:”<br><br><blockquote>x x x persons who witness an event perceive the same from their respective points of reference. <b>Therefore, almost always, they have different accounts of how it happened</b>. Certainly, we cannot expect the testimony of witnesses to a crime to be consistent in all aspects because different persons have different impressions and recollections of the same incident. x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[145]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>The statements made by the bystanders, although admissible, have little persuasive value since the bystanders could have seen the events transpiring at different vantage points and at different points in time. Even Frisco Capilo, one of the bystanders at the time of the attack, testified that the attackers had their masks on at first, but later on, some remained masked and some were unmasked.<br><br>When the bystanders’ testimonies are weighed against those of the victims who witnessed the entirety of the incident from beginning to end at close range, the former become merely corroborative of the fact that an attack occurred. Their account of the incident, therefore, must be given considerably less weight than that of the victims.<br><br><b>The belated identification by<br>the victims do not detract from <br>their positive identification of the <br>appellants</b><br><br>It is argued that the fact that the victims stayed silent about the incident to the U.P. Police or the Quezon City Police but instead executed affidavits with the National Bureau of Investigation four (4) days after the incident gives doubt as to the credibility of their testimonies.<br><br>U.P. Police Officer Romeo Cabrera<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[146]</sup> testified that on their way to the U.P.

Meanwhile, Dr. Mislang<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[147]</sup> testified to the effect that when she asked Natalicio who attacked them, Natalicio answered that he did not know because they were masked.<br><br>It must be remembered that the parties involved in this case belong to rival fraternities. While this court does not condone their archaic and oftentimes barbaric traditions, it is conceded that there are certain practices that are unique to fraternal organizations.<br><br>It is quite possible that at this point in time, they knew the identities of their attackers but chose not to disclose it without first conferring with their other fraternity brothers. This probability is bolstered by the actions of Sigma Rho <i>after</i> the incident, which showed that they confronted the members of Scintilla Juris in SM North. Because of the tenuous relationship of rival fraternities, it would not have been prudent for Sigma Rho to retaliate against the wrong fraternity.<br><br>Their act of not disclosing the correct information to the U.P. Police or to Dr. Mislang does not make the police officer or the doctor’s testimonies more credible than that of the victims. It should not be forgotten that the victims actually witnessed the entire incident, while Officer Salvador, Officer Cabrera, and Dr. Mislang were merely relaying second- hand information.<br><br>The fact that they went to the National Bureau of Investigation four (4) days after the incident also does not affect their credibility since most of them had been hospitalized from their injuries and needed to recover first. Since a fraternity moves as one unit, it would be understandable that they decided to wait until <i>all</i> of them were well enough to go to the National Bureau of Investigation headquarters in order to give their statements.<br><br>Seniority is also often the norm in fraternities. It was upon the advice of their senior “<i>brods</i>” and their legal counsel that they executed their sworn statements before the National Bureau of Investigation four (4) days after the incident.<br><br>The decision to report the incident to the National Bureau of Investigation instead of to the U.P. Police was the call of their legal counsel who might have deemed the National Bureau of Investigation more equipped to handle the investigation. This does not, however, affect the credibility of the witnesses since they were merely following the legal advice of their counsel.<br><br>Indeed, there is reason to believe that the National Bureau of Investigation is better equipped than the U.P. Police to handle the investigation of the case. As stated in the U.P. College of Economics website:<br><br><blockquote><b>The UP Diliman Police (UPDP) is tasked with maintaining campus security.</b> Their station is located in front of the College of Architecture.<br><br>The primary missions of the UPDP are to maintain peace and order, secure and protect lives and property, enforce basic laws, applicable Quezon City Ordinances, and University Rules and Regulations including policies and standards; and to perform such other functions relative to the general safety and security of the students, employees, and residents in the U.P. Diliman Campus. x x x.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[148]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>It can be seen that the U.P. Police is employed by U.P. primarily for campus security. They are by no means an actual police force that is equipped to handle a full-blown murder investigation. Fraternity-related violence in U.P. has also increasingly become more frequent, which might possibly have desensitized the U.P. Police in such a way that would prevent their objectivity in the conduct of their investigations. The victims’ reliance on the National Bureau of Investigation, therefore, is understandable.<br><br><center><b>III</b><br></center><br><b>Alibi cannot prevail over the <br>positive identification of the <br>victim</b><br><br>It is settled that the defense of alibi cannot prevail over the positive identification of the victim.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[149]</sup> In <i>People v.

For alibi to prosper, it is not enough to prove that appellant was somewhere else when the crime was committed; he must also demonstrate that it was physically impossible for him to have been at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission. Unless substantiated by clear and convincing proof, such defense is negative, self-serving, and undeserving of any weight in law. Denial, like alibi, as an exonerating justification[,] is inherently weak and if uncorroborated regresses to blatant impotence.

The appellate court, however, incorrectly ruled out the presence of treachery in the commission of the offense.<br><br>It has been stated previously by this court that:<br><br><blockquote>[T]reachery is present when the offender commits any of the crimes against persons, employing means, methods, or forms in the execution, which tend directly and specially to insure its execution, without risk to the offender arising from the defense which the offended party might make.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[152]</sup></blockquote><br>Similarly, in <i>People v.

For treachery to be considered, two elements must concur: (1) the employment of means of execution that gives the persons attacked no opportunity to defend themselves or retaliate; and (2) the means of execution were deliberately or consciously adopted.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[154]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br><br>The appellate court, in affirming the conviction of the accused- appellants, ruled that contrary to the findings of the trial court, there was no treachery involved.

The victims in this case were eating lunch on campus.

The only way they could parry the blows was with their arms. In a situation where they were unarmed and outnumbered, it would be impossible for them to fight back against the attackers. The attack also happened in less than a minute, which would preclude any possibility of the bystanders being able to help them until after the incident.<br><br>The swiftness and the suddenness of the attack gave no opportunity for the victims to retaliate or even to defend themselves. Treachery, therefore, was present in this case.<br><br><b>The presence of conspiracy makes<br> all of the accused-appellants liable <br>for murder and attempted murder</b><br><br>In the decision of the trial court, all of the accused-appellants were found guilty of the murder of Dennis Venturina and the attempted murder of Mervin Natalicio, Cesar Mangrobang, Jr. Leandro Lachica, Arnel Fortes, and Cristobal Gaston, Jr. The appellate court, however, modified their liabilities and found that the accused-appellants were guilty of attempted murder only against Natalicio and Fortes, and not against Mangrobang, Lachica, and Gaston.<br><br>It is the appellate court’s reasoning that because Lachica and Mangrobang “were no longer chased by the attackers,”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[157]</sup> it concluded that accused-appellants “voluntary desisted from pursuing them and from inflicting harm to them, which shows that they did not have the intent to do more than to make them suffer pain by slightly injuring them.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[158]</sup> It also pointed out that the wound inflicted on Gaston “was too shallow to have been done with an intent to kill.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[159]</sup> Thus, it concluded that the accused- appellants would have been guilty only of slight physical injuries.<br><br>This is erroneous.<br><br>It should be remembered that the trial court found that there was conspiracy among the accused-appellants<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[160]</sup> and the appellate court sustained this finding.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[161]</sup> Conspiracy, once proven, has the effect of attaching liability to all of the accused, regardless of their degree of participation, thus:<br><br><blockquote><b>Once an express or implied conspiracy is proved, all of the conspirators are liable as co-principals regardless of the extent and character of their respective active participation in the commission of the crime or crimes perpetrated in furtherance of the conspiracy because in contemplation of law the act of one is the act of all</b>. The foregoing rule is anchored on the sound principle that "when two or more persons unite to accomplish a criminal object, whether through the physical volition of one, or all, proceeding severally or collectively, each individual whose evil will actively contributes to the wrong-doing is in law responsible for the whole, the same as though performed by himself alone." Although it is axiomatic that no one is liable for acts other than his own, "when two or more persons agree or conspire to commit a crime, each is responsible for all the acts of the others, done in furtherance of the agreement or conspiracy." The imposition of collective liability upon the conspirators is clearly explained in one case where this Court held that<br><br><blockquote>... it is impossible to graduate the separate liability of each (conspirator) without taking into consideration the close and inseparable relation of each of them with the criminal act, for the commission of which they all acted by common agreement ... The crime must therefore in view of the solidarity of the act and intent which existed between the ... accused, be regarded as the act of the band or party created by them, and they are all equally responsible</blockquote><br><b>Verily, the moment it is established that the malefactors conspired and confederated in the commission of the felony proved, collective liability of the accused conspirators attaches by reason of the conspiracy, and the court shall not speculate nor even investigate as to the actual degree of participation of each of the perpetrators present at the scene of the crime.</b> x x x.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[162]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The liabilities of the accused-appellants in this case arose from a single incident wherein the accused-appellants were armed with baseball bats and lead pipes, all in agreement to do the highest amount of damage possible to the victims. Some were able to run away and take cover, but the others would fall prey at the hands of their attackers. The intent to kill was already present at the moment of attack and that intent was shared by all of the accused-appellants alike when the presence of conspiracy was proven. It is, therefore, immaterial to distinguish between the seriousness of the injuries suffered by the victims to determine the respective liabilities of their attackers. What is relevant is only as to whether the death occurs as a result of that intent to kill and whether there are qualifying, aggravating or mitigating circumstances that can be appreciated.<br><br>The appellate court, therefore, erred in finding the accused-appellants guilty only of slight physical injuries. It would be illogical to presume that despite the swiftness and suddenness of the attack, the attackers intended to kill only Venturina, Natalicio, and Fortes, and only intended to injure Lachica, Mangrobang, and Gaston. Since the intent to kill was evident from the moment the accused-appellants took their first swing, all of them were liable for that intent to kill.<br><br>For this reason, the accused-appellants should be liable for the murder of Dennis Venturina and the attempted murder of Mervin Natalicio, Cesar Mangrobang, Jr., Leandro Lachica, Arnel Fortes, and Cristobal Gaston, Jr.<br><br><b><center>A Final Note</center></b><br>It is not only the loss of one promising young life; rather, it is also the effect on the five other lives whose once bright futures are now put in jeopardy because of one senseless' act of bravado. There is now more honor for them to accept their responsibility and serve the consequences of their actions. There is, however, nothing that they can do to bring back Dennis Venturina or fully compensate for his senseless and painful loss.<br><br>This is not the first fraternity-related case to come to this court; neither will it be the last. Perhaps this case and many cases like it can empower those who have a better: view of masculinity: one which valorizes courage, sacrifice and honor in more life-saving pursuits.<br><br>"<i>Giting at dangal</i>" are words of the anthem of the University of the Philippines. It colors the stories of many who choose to expend their energy in order that our people will have better lives. Fraternity rumbles are an anathema, an immature and useless expenditure of testosterone. It fosters a culture that retards manhood. It is devoid of "<i>giting at dangal</i>."<br><br>This kind of shameful violence must stop.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

(To avoid confusion, SR or SJ is affixed before the names of those involved to distinguish members of the Sigma Rho Fraternity from members of the Scintilla Juris Fraternity.)<br><br>SR Leandro Lachica, his fraternity's Grand Archon, testified that the attackers all wore improvised masks of cloth or t-shirts. Five of them went after SR Lachica, hitting him on the back and forearms as he parried the blows. In the course of that attack, the mask of one of them, SJ Robert Michael Beltran Alvir, with whom he was familiar, fell off.

But he was unable to recognize them because they wore masks and he could see only their eyes.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Capilo, on the other hand, testified that he was on his way to the Main Library to work when several men, all wearing masks and carrying lead pipes, rushed towards the canteen and attacked some who were eating there.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Daniel Mabazza testified that he was on his way out of the canteen when 15 men arrived from the South wing of the Main Library and attacked some customers who were eating at the tables.

On arrival at the Beach House Canteen, they saw the wounded SR Natalicio with some companions. They put him on board a jeepney and brought him to the UP Infirmary with his companions. On the way, Cabrera asked SR Natalicio who attacked his group. He replied that he did not recognize any of them because they wore masks.

He was on his way out of the mall when he chanced upon two of his “brods.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>The RTC absolved SJ Rodolfo Peñalosa on a demurrer to evidence since none of the prosecution witnesses testified that he had taken part in the attack.<br><br>On February 28, 2002 the RTC rendered judgment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> finding SJ Alvir, Feliciano, Soliva, Medalla, and Zingapan guilty beyond reasonable doubt of one count of murder and four counts of attempted murder. The court gave credence to the testimonies of the victims who identified their attackers. It thought little of the failure of some of the victims to name them when asked by the UP police officers and the physicians at the Infirmary. It did not agree that the victims’ delayed identification of their attackers tainted their testimonies. The RTC held that the accused conspired in the commission of the crimes charged. But it acquitted SJ Ablanida, Fajardo, Magpantay, Morano, and Narag for failure of the prosecution to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA), Special First Division of Five,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> with one Justice dissenting, affirmed the RTC Decision and found SJ Alvir, Feliciano, Soliva, Medalla, and Zingapan guilty of three counts of slight physical injuries in Criminal Cases Q95-61136, Q95-61135, and Q95-61134; two counts of attempted murder in Criminal Cases Q95-61138 and Q95-61137; and one count of murder in Criminal Case Q95-61133. The CA imposed on the accused the penalties that corresponded to the offenses and ordered them to pay various civil indemnities to the victims or, in the case of SR Venturina, to his heirs.<br><br>The CA ruled that the witnesses’ positive identification of SJ Alvir, Feliciano, Soliva, Medalla, and Zingapan prevailed over the latter’s defenses and alibis. It regarded the inconsistencies in the testimonies of the witnesses as trivial and did not tarnish their credibility. The CA held that the delay in the identification of the accused had been explained: SR Natalicio and Fortes needed medical attention; the others with them wanted to come together when they filed their complaints.<br><br>The CA explained that it characterized the crimes charged in Criminal Cases Q95-61136, Q95-61135, and Q95-61134 as mere slight physical injuries since the intent to kill was not evident, given that none of the accused chased them. SR Gaston, said the CA, suffered only a lacerated wound near his breast, precluding an attempt on his life.<br><br><center><b>The Issue Presented</b></center><br>The central issue in this case is whether or not the CA erred, like the RTC, in not rejecting the victims’ identification of their assailants as mere fabrications to go around the fact that the latter wore masks and in thus not absolving the accused of the charges.<br><br>In every criminal action, the prosecution has to establish the identity of the offender, like the crime itself, by proof beyond reasonable doubt. Indeed, its first duty is to prove the identity of the offender for, even if the commission of the offense can be established, no conviction can take place without proof of his identity beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>True, alibi is a weak defense in the face of positive testimonies of prosecution witnesses that the accused committed the crime. But such testimonies must be credible and must come from credible witnesses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Several circumstances militate against the mauling victims’ testimonies that they were able to identify their attackers:<br><br>1.&nbsp; SR Lachica, one of the victims, himself testified that the men he saw coming to attack his group, at least 10 in number, all wore masks.

He appears to have just made up the statement to get on record evidence that the two were part of the attackers.<br><br>2.&nbsp; SR Natalicio testified that the men who attacked them mostly wore masks but SJ Medalla who led those men wore no mask.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> This is not easy to believe since SR Lachica, the other prosecution witness, testified that the attackers all wore masks but when he looked back while getting away, he saw SJ Medalla already without a mask, implying that the latter lost it, thus belying SR Natalicio’s testimony that SJ Medalla wore no mask from the start.<br><br>SR Natalicio testified that while parrying his attackers’ blows, he saw SJ Zingapan and Soliva.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> These two must be near each other since he saw them at glance. But, contradicting SR Natalicio, SR Gaston also saw SJ Zingapan, not with Soliva but with Morano.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>3.&nbsp; The RTC itself gave no credence to SR Mangrobang’s testimony and for this reason acquitted SJ Magpantay and Fajardo, two of his attackers whose masks supposedly fell off. The trial court also acquitted SJ Narag, whom SR Mangrobang said he saw, when he returned to the scene of the commotion, hitting SR Venturina with the aid of SJ Feliciano. It is quite unbelievable that having narrowly escaped his attackers, SR Mangrobang would go back while the mauling was still in progress. Finally, the trial court acquitted SJ Ablanida whom SR Mangrobang said he saw wielding a lead pipe while running because it simply could not believe this witness.<br><br>4.&nbsp; After SR Lachica and Natalicio, the third witness to use the look-back proposition was SR Gaston. He testified that one of two masked men tried to bludgeon him on the head as the other lunged at him with a knife, wounding his chest and forearm. As SR Gaston ran and escaped from those two men, he managed to look back just to place SJ Zingapan and Morano at the scene of the mauling.<br><br>The trial court itself found something terribly wrong with SR Gaston’s testimonies. It said:<br><br><blockquote>In this regard, Gaston related a hazy story. At one point, he said that he saw Zingapan and Morano at the same place but not at the same time explaining that the former was there first and when he moved, the latter stood in the same place. Later, he said that both were there at the same time. Granting arguendo that Morano was moving, his story does not entirely jibe with that of Fortes.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></blockquote><br>5.&nbsp; SR Fortes was the fourth witness to foist the same look-back proposition. He ran away after seeing about 15 men, armed with lead pipes and clubs, coming to attack his group. But he looked back while on the run to see SJ Zingapan and Morano, who supposedly had no masks, right behind him. They hit him on the back, causing him to fall. As he stood up and tried to run again, a group of 10 men attacked him for five to eight seconds. He recognized none of them. But, standing up again after the second attack, he supposedly saw SJ Feliciano whose mask fell off while beating up SR Venturina.<br><br>Just what are the chances that four out of five witnesses who were fleeing and, indeed, running for their lives would just look back, risk stumbling and crashing down, to put in evidence the identities of some of those whom the RTC and the CA convicted? Very little. It appears a convenient excuse for providing evidence where none existed. The circumstances of the separate identifications, taking place in split seconds, defy belief. What baffles <b>me</b> is the fact that the trial court acquitted SJ Morano whom SR Fortes and Gaston identified while looking back on the run but convicted SJ Zingapan, Soliva, and Medalla who were also targets of look-back testimonies.<br><br>The trial court had reason to further doubt SR Fortes’ testimonies. It said:<br><br><blockquote>By the way, the Court has not ignored the testimony of Arnel Fortes that Morano repeatedly struck him with a lead pipe. It was, however, given during the rebuttal stage. When he sat at the witness stand for the first time, he said nothing of that sort. He could have been saying the truth and that what he related was not an afterthought but still the cloud of doubt remains. As there still that haziness, the barrier remains uncleared.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></blockquote><br>6.&nbsp; Emmanuel Batungbakal of course testified that he saw three plate-less cars rush out towards the Main Library<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> with SJ Feliciano on board one car. But this testimony is inconclusive since Batungbakal admitted on cross-examination that he was not sure it was SJ Feliciano he saw. Besides, as pointed out above, no credible testimony supports the view that SJ Feliciano in fact took part in the mauling.<br><br>The trial court acquitted some of the accused after rejecting the testimonies of SR Mangrobang who fingered SJ Feliciano as well. On the other hand, although SR Gaston did not mention SJ Feliciano on direct testimony, he brought up his name only on cross, a catch-up kind of testimony that the trial court rejected in SJ Morano’s case. SR Fortes, the final witness against SJ Feliciano, said an uncanny thing: two groups of attackers had just bludgeoned him one after the other, yet SR Fortes claimed that he still managed to stand up in time to observe SJ Feliciano attacking SR Venturina.<br><br>7.&nbsp; Notably, the two sides gave conflicting testimonies regarding the victims’ opportunity to identify their attackers.&nbsp; The prosecution witnesses claim that some of the attackers could be identified because they wore no masks or their masks fell off. The defense witnesses testified that all the attackers wore masks and none of these fell off. Since identification of the attackers is the key issue, the Court has to consider which witnesses and stories appear to be more credible.<br><br><b>I am</b> impressed with the testimony of UP police officer Salvador, who had served the UP’s police force for 18 years and had no motive to fabricate or lie. He testified that when he and fellow officer Cabrera arrived at the scene of the mauling, he asked the bystanders the identities of the assailants. The bystanders replied that they were unable to identify the attackers because they wore masks. Salvador testified:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Upon being informed by the blue guard that there was a rumble near the Beach House canteen, tell the Court what did you and Cabrera do?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">We rushed to the place where the incident took place, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q:</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">And upon reaching the area of the Beach House Canteen, what did you notice?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A:</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">I noticed one victim together with some people, sir, and I asked some of the bystanders if they saw what happened and they said they did not recognize the attackers because they were wearing mask.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>The statement of the bystanders, made while some of the wounded were bleeding there and the excitement lingered, may be given in evidence as part of the <i>res gestae.</i> Section 42, Rule 130 of the Rules of Evidence provides:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 42.

But between the latter, on the one hand, and those officers and the doctor, on the other, the Court should have been more inclined to believe the latter.<br><br>Indeed, there is no evidence that SR Natalicio, Lachica, Fortes, Gaston, Mangrobang, and Tumaneng, who survived the mauling, gave statements shortly after the incident either to the UP police officers or the Quezon City police which had primary jurisdiction over the crimes. They took four days mulling over it before going to the NBI to name their assailants.<br><br>10. SR Natalicio of course gave a different version of his interview with the UP police officers. When they asked him who their assailants were, he said that he requested them to come back as he was not feeling well.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>&nbsp; There is testimony that two of his Sigma Rho brothers conferred with him to discuss what happened and their strategy for getting back at those whom they believed were responsible. Further to this, SR Lachica<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> and Gaston<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> testified that they met with their alumni brothers that evening. SR Natalicio said that when the police officers came back to ask him the identities of the attackers, a senior fraternity brother-lawyer was present and he told the police officers that the statements would be given to the NBI and they would just be furnished copies.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>This is ludicrous. The right to silence is given to persons under suspicion for committing some crimes, not to the victims whose duty is to promptly assist the police investigators in pinpointing criminal responsibilities. No evidence has been presented to show that the UP police force was partial to the opposing fraternity. <b>I am</b> thus unable to blame the accused for believing that the only possible reason in this case for withholding information from the police from day one was that the victims and their counsel had yet to put their acts together.<br><br>11.&nbsp; The supposed identification of the accused came four days later at the NBI office in Manila. Admittedly, the victims and their brods waited for everyone to be ready before they came as a group to give their statements at the NBI office. The excuse that SR Natalicio and Fortes needed medical attention and that the others with them wanted to come together when they filed their complaints at the NBI is not a valid excuse. Since they claim that they were terribly aggrieved and that one of them lost his life, the natural thing was for them to demand immediate justice and action from the police or the NBI on the afternoon of December 8, 1994.<br><br>12. The prosecution witnesses testified that the masks of five of the accused just fell off to reveal who they were. These were (a) SJ Alvir per SR Lachica’s testimony;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> (b) SJ Zingapan and (c) SJ Medalla also per SR Lachica’s testimony that the two were not wearing masks when he looked back and saw them,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> implying that they had masks at the beginning of the attack; (d) SJ Magpantay and (e) SJ Fajardo per SR Mangrobang’s testimony that the masks of these two fell off.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> SR Fortes also testified that he saw SJ Feliciano’s mask fell off as he was hitting SR Venturina.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>Just what are the chances that the masks of five out of 12 accused just fell off during the mauling? Quite little or nil since it was not actually a fraternity rumble where the protagonists hit each other creating the possibility that any mask they were wearing could fall off. Here, the victims testified that they bore the punishment and were unable to fight back since their attackers were numerous and carried lead pipes and clubs. Indeed, none of the victims testified that his action in protecting his head resulted in the unmasking of one or some of his attackers. Evidently, the attackers deliberately wore masks to hide their identities. It made no sense for them to wear masks that would just fall off when one sneezes.<br><br>Those who swing bats to strike at objects before them rarely hit their own faces. Only in funny movies like The Three Stooges can that happen. What are the chances that a mask would just fall off from the face of the person wearing it? Construction and industrial laborers doing strenuous work wear mask all day long to protect themselves from dusts, chemicals, or fumes. Food processing workers wear them at work to prevent food contamination. They are not likely to be heard experiencing unpredictable falling off of masks taking place in great number. Here, if the prosecution were to be believed, five out of just 12 accused lost their masks in only 30 to 45 seconds. The odds of this happening are unbelievable.<br><br>Indeed, prosecution witness Gaio himself who was at the scene of the commotion testified that he did not see any of the attackers losing their masks at any point in time.
