				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The proper remedy for a judicial declaration of presumptive death obtained by extrinsic fraud is an action to annul the judgment. An affidavit of reappearance is not the proper remedy when the person declared presumptively dead has never been absent.<br><br>This is a petition for review on certiorari filed by Celerina J. Santos, assailing the Court of Appeals' resolutions dated November 28, 2008 and March 5, 2009. The Court of Appeals dismissed the petition for the annulment of the trial court's judgment declaring her presumptively dead.<br><br>On July 27, 2007, the Regional Trial Court of Tarlac City declared petitioner Celerina J. Santos (Celerina) presumptively dead after her husband, respondent Ricardo T. Santos (Ricardo), had filed a petition for declaration of absence or presumptive death for the purpose of remarriage on&nbsp; June 15, 2007.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Ricardo remarried on September 17, 2008.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>In his petition for declaration of absence or presumptive death, Ricardo alleged that he and Celerina rented an apartment somewhere in San Juan, Metro Manila; after they had gotten married on June 18, 1980.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> After a year, they moved to Tarlac City.

Celerina could always file an affidavit of reappearance to terminate the subsequent marriage. Ricardo iterated the Court of Appeals' ruling that the remedy afforded to Celerina under Article 42 of the Family Code is the appropriate remedy.<br><br>The petition is meritorious.<br><br>Annulment of judgment is the remedy when the Regional Trial Court's judgment, order, or resolution has become final, and the "remedies of new trial, appeal, petition for relief (or other appropriate remedies) are no longer available through no fault of the petitioner."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>The grounds for annulment of judgment are extrinsic fraud and lack of jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> This court defined extrinsic fraud in <i>Stilianopulos v. City of Legaspi</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br><blockquote>For fraud to become a basis for annulment of judgment, it has to be extrinsic or actual. It is intrinsic when the fraudulent acts pertain to an issue involved in the original action or where the acts constituting the fraud were or could have been litigated, <i>It is extrinsic or collateral when a litigant commits acts outside of the trial which prevents a parly from having a real contest, or from presenting all of his case, such that there is no fair submission of the controversy.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Celerina alleged in her petition for annulment of judgment that there was fraud when Ricardo deliberately made false allegations in the court with respect to her residence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Ricardo also falsely claimed that she was absent for 12 years. There was also no publication of the notice of hearing of Ricardo's petition in a newspaper of general circulation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Celerina claimed that because of these, she was deprived of notice and opportunity to oppose Ricardo's petition to declare her presumptively dead.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Celerina alleged that all the facts supporting Ricardo's petition for declaration of presumptive death were false.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Celerina further claimed that the court did not acquire jurisdiction because the Office of the Solicitor General and the Provincial Prosecutor's Office were not given copies of Ricardo's petition.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>These are allegations of extrinsic fraud and lack of jurisdiction. Celerina alleged in her petition with the Court of Appeals sufficient ground/s for annulment of judgment.<br><br>Celerina filed her petition for annulment of judgment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> on November 17, 2008. This was less than two years from the July 27, 2007 decision declaring her presumptively dead and about a month from her discovery of the decision in October 2008. The petition was, therefore, filed within the four-year period allowed by law in case of extrinsic fraud, and before the action is barred by laches, which is the period allowed in case of lack of jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>There was also no other sufficient remedy available to Celerina at the time of her discovery of the fraud perpetrated on her.<br><br>The choice of remedy is important because remedies carry with them certain admissions, presumptions, and conditions.<br><br>The Family Code provides that it is the proof of absence of a spouse for four consecutive years, coupled with a well-founded belief by the present spouse that the absent spouse is already dead, that constitutes a justification for a second marriage during the subsistence of another marriage.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>The Family Code also provides that the second marriage is in danger of being terminated by the presumptively dead spouse when he or she reappears. Thus:<br><br><blockquote>Article 42. The subsequent marriage referred to in the preceding Article shall be automatically terminated by the recording of the affidavit of reappearance of the absent spouse, <i>unless there is a judgment annulling the previous marriage or declaring it void ab initio.</i><br><br>A <i>sworn statement </i>of the fact and circumstances of reappearance shall be recorded in the civil registry of the residence of the parties to the subsequent marriage at the instance of any interested person, with <i>due notice</i> to the spouses of the subsequent marriage and without prejudice to the fact of <i>reappearance being judicially determined in case such fact is disputed</i>. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>In other words, the Family Code provides the presumptively dead spouse with the remedy of terminating the subsequent marriage by mere reappearance.<br><br>The filing of an affidavit of reappearance is an admission on the part of the first spouse that his or her marriage to the present spouse was terminated when he or she was declared absent or presumptively dead.<br><br>Moreover, a close reading of the entire Article 42 reveals that the termination of the subsequent marriage by reappearance is subject to several conditions: (1) the non-existence of a judgment annulling the previous marriage or declaring it void <i>ab initio</i>; (2) recording in the civil registry of the residence of the parties to the subsequent marriage of the sworn statement of fact and circumstances of reappearance; (3) due notice to the spouses of the subsequent marriage of the fact of reappearance; and (4) the fact of reappearance must either be undisputed or judicially determined.<br><br>The existence of these conditions means that reappearance does not always immediately cause the subsequent marriage's termination.&nbsp; Reappearance of the absent or presumptively dead spouse will cause the termination of the subsequent marriage only when all the conditions enumerated in the Family Code are present.<br><br>Hence, the subsequent marriage may still subsist despite the absent or presumptively dead spouse's reappearance (1) if the first marriage has already been annulled or has been declared a nullity; (2) if the sworn statement of the reappearance is not recorded in the civil registry of the subsequent spouses' residence; (3) if there is no notice to the subsequent spouses; or (4) if the fact of reappearance is disputed in the proper courts of law, and no judgment is yet rendered confirming, such fact of reappearance.<br><br>When subsequent marriages are contracted after a judicial declaration of presumptive death, a presumption arises that the first spouse is already dead and that the second marriage is legal. This presumption should prevail over the continuance of the marital relations with the first spouse.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> The second marriage, as with all marriages, is presumed valid.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> The burden of proof to show that the first marriage was not properly dissolved rests on the person assailing the validity of the second marriage.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>This court recognized the conditional nature of reappearance as a cause for terminating the subsequent marriage in <i>Social Security System v. Vda. de Bailon</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> This court noted<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> that mere reappearance will not terminate the subsequent marriage even if the parties to the subsequent marriage were notified if there was "no step . . . taken to terminate the subsequent marriage, either by [filing an] affidavit [of reappearance] or by court action[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> "Since the second marriage has been contracted because of a presumption that the former spouse is dead, such presumption continues inspite of the spouse's physical reappearance, and by <i>fiction of law, he or she must still be regarded as legally an absentee until the subsequent marriage is terminated as provided by law.</i>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>The choice of the proper remedy is also important for purposes of determining the status of the second marriage and the liabilities of the spouse who, in bad faith, claimed that the other spouse was absent.<br><br>A second marriage is bigamous while the first subsists.&nbsp; However, a bigamous subsequent marriage may be considered valid when the following are present:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">1)</div></td> <td width="95%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">The prior spouse had been absent for four consecutive years;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">2)</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">The spouse present has a well-founded belief that the absent spouse was already dead;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">3) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">There must be a summary proceeding for the declaration of presumptive death of the absent spouse; and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">4) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">There is a court declaration of presumptive death of the absent spouse.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[55]</sup></font></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>A subsequent marriage contracted in bad faith, even if it was contracted after a court declaration of presumptive death, lacks the requirement of a well-founded belief<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> that the spouse is already dead. The first marriage will not be considered as. validly terminated. Marriages contracted prior to the valid termination of a subsisting marriage are generally considered bigamous and void.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Only a subsequent marriage contracted in good faith is protected by law.<br><br>Therefore, the party who contracted the subsequent marriage in bad faith is also not immune from an action to declare his subsequent marriage void for being bigamous. The prohibition against marriage during the subsistence of another marriage still applies.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>If, as Celerina contends, Ricardo was in bad faith when he filed his petition to declare her presumptively dead and when he contracted the subsequent marriage, such marriage would be considered void for being bigamous under Article 35(4) of the Family Code. This is because the circumstances lack the element of "well-founded belief under Article 41 of the Family Code, which is essential for the exception to the rule against bigamous marriages to apply.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>The provision on reappearance in the Family Code as a remedy to effect the termination of the subsequent marriage does not preclude the spouse who was declared presumptively dead from availing other remedies existing in law. This court had, in fact, recognized that a subsequent marriage may also be terminated by filing "an action in court to prove the reappearance of the absentee and obtain a declaration of dissolution or termination of the subsequent marriage."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>Celerina does not admit to have been absent. She also seeks not merely the termination of the subsequent marriage but also the nullification of its effects. She contends that reappearance is not a sufficient remedy because it will only terminate the subsequent marriage but not nullify the effects of the declaration of her presumptive death and the subsequent marriage.<br><br>Celerina is correct. Since an undisturbed subsequent marriage under Article 42 of the Family Code is valid until terminated, the "children of such marriage shall be considered legitimate, and the property relations of the spouse[s] in such marriage will be the same as in valid marriages."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> If it is terminated by mere reappearance, the children of the subsequent marriage conceived before the termination shall still be considered legitimate.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Moreover, a judgment declaring presumptive death is a defense against prosecution for bigamy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>It is true that in most cases, an action to declare the nullity of the subsequent marriage may nullify the effects of the subsequent marriage, specifically, in relation to the status of children and the prospect of prosecuting a respondent for bigamy.<br><br>However, "a Petition for Declaration of Absolute Nullity of Void Marriages may be filed solely by the husband or wife."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup>&nbsp; This means that even if Celerina is a real party in interest who stands to be benefited or injured by the outcome of an action to nullify the second marriage,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> this remedy is not available to her.<br><br>Therefore, for the purpose of not only terminating the subsequent marriage but also of nullifying the effects of the declaration of presumptive death and the subsequent marriage, mere filing of an affidavit of reappearance would not suffice.
