It may even be true. However, it does not remove such reasonable conclusion that he was the author of the acts complained about in this case.<br><br>Petitioner’s intent to kill is evident from his attempt to stab private complainants more than once.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> Petitioner chased private complainants after they had tried to flee from him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> The wounds inflicted by petitioner were also shown to have been fatal if no medical attention had been given to private complainants immediately after the incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup><br><br>Petitioner’s acts did not result in private complainants’ deaths despite petitioner having already performed all acts of execution of the crime.

Aggravating Circumstances. — The following are aggravating circumstances:<br><blockquote>. . . .<br><br>16. That the act be committed with treachery (alevosia).<br><br>There is treachery when the offender commits any of the crimes against the person, employing means, methods, or forms in the execution thereof, which tend directly and specially to insure its execution, without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might make.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup></blockquote></blockquote><br>The requisites of treachery are:<br><br><blockquote>(1) [T]he employment of means, method, or manner of execution which will ensure the safety of the malefactor from defensive or retaliating acts on the part of the victim, no opportunity being given to the latter to defend himself or to retaliate;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup> and<br><br>(2) [D]eliberate or conscious adoption of such means, method, or manner of execution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup></blockquote><br>A finding of the existence of treachery should be based on “clear and convincing evidence.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup> Such evidence must be as conclusive as the fact of killing itself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup> Its existence “cannot be presumed.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup> As with the finding of guilt of the accused, “[a]ny doubt as to [its] existence . . . [should] be resolved in favor of the accused.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup><br><br>The unexpectedness of an attack cannot be the sole basis of a finding of treachery<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup> even if the attack was intended to kill another as long as the victim’s position was merely accidental.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup> The means adopted must have been a result of a determination to ensure success in committing the crime.<br><br>In this case, no evidence was presented to show that petitioner consciously adopted or reflected on the means, method, or form of attack to secure his unfair advantage.<br><br>The attack might “have been done on impulse [or] as a reaction to an actual or imagined provocation offered by the victim.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup> In this case, petitioner was not only dismissed by Austria when he approached him for money. There was also an altercation between him and Naval. The provocation might have been enough to entice petitioner to action and attack private complainants.<br><br>Therefore, the manner of attack might not have been motivated by a determination to ensure success in committing the crime. What was more likely the case, based on private complainants’ testimonies, was that petitioner’s action was an impulsive reaction to being dismissed by Austria, his altercation with Naval, and Naval’s attempt to summon Austria home.<br><br>Generally, this type of provocation negates the existence of treachery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup> This is the type of provocation that does not lend itself to premeditation. The provocation in this case is of the kind which triggers impulsive reactions left unchecked by the accused and caused him to commit the crime. There was no evidence of a modicum of premeditation indicating the possibility of choice and planning fundamental to achieve the elements of treachery.<br><br>The ability of the offended parties to retaliate and protect themselves may not by itself negate the existence of treachery. The efforts of the accused to employ means and method to ensure his safety and freedom from retaliation may not have succeeded. However, in this case, the ability of the offended parties to have avoided greater harm by running away or by being able to subdue the accused is a strong indicator that no treachery exists.<br><br>It is, therefore, an error for both the trial and appellate courts not to have considered the evidence that the offended parties were able to flee and retaliate. Upon proof of evasion and retaliation, courts must evaluate the evidence further to ensure whether there can be reasonable doubt for this qualifying circumstance to exist. This is only in keeping with the presumption of innocence of the accused.<br><br>Thus, in the absence of clear proof of the existence of treachery, the crime proven beyond reasonable doubt is only frustrated homicide and, correspondingly, the penalty should be reduced.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup><br><br><center>IV<br></center><br>Article 250 of the Revised Penal Code provides that a penalty lower by one degree than that which should be imposed for homicide may be imposed upon a person guilty of frustrated homicide.<br><br>The imposable penalty for homicide is <i>reclusion temporal</i>. Article 50 of the Revised Penal Code provides that the penalty to be imposed upon principals of a frustrated crime shall be the penalty next lower in degree than that prescribed by law for the consummated crimes. The penalty next lower in degree is <i>prision mayor.</i><br><br>Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the penalty to be imposed must have a maximum term which can be properly imposed under the rules considering the attending circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup> Since there is no attending circumstance in this case, the penalty of <i>prision mayor </i>in its medium term or eight (8) years and one (1) day as maximum should be imposed.
