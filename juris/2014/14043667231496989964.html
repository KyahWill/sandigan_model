and<br><br>(ii) The employees recruited, supplied or placed by such contractor or subcontractor are performing activities which are directly related to the main business of the principal.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Section 6. <i>Permissible contracting or subcontracting</i>. - Subject to the conditions set forth in Section 3 (d) and (e) and Section 5 hereof, the principal may engage the services of a contractor or subcontractor for the performance of any of the following:<br><br>(a) Works or services temporarily or occasionally needed to meet abnormal increase in the demand of products or services, provided that the normal production capacity or regular workforce of the principal cannot reasonably cope with such demands;<br><br>(b) Works or services temporarily or occasionally needed by the principal for undertakings requiring expert or highly technical personnel to improve the management or operations of an enterprise;<br><br>(c) Services temporarily needed for the introduction or promotion of new products, only for the duration of the introductory or promotional period;<br><br>(d) Works or services not directly related or not integral to the main business or operation of the principal, including casual work, janitorial, security, landscaping, and messengerial services, and work not related to manufacturing processes in manufacturing establishments;<br><br>(e) Services involving the public display of manufacturers’ products which do not involve the act of selling or issuance of receipts or invoices;<br><br>(f) Specialized works involving the use of some particular, unusual or peculiar skills, expertise, tools or equipment the performance of which is beyond the competence of the regular workforce or production capacity of the principal; and<br><br>(g) Unless a reliever system is in place among the regular workforce, substitute services for absent regular employees, provided that the period of service shall be coextensive with the period of absence and the same is made clear to the substitute employee at the time of engagement. The phrase “<i>absent regular employees</i>” includes those who are serving suspensions or other disciplinary measures not amounting to termination of employment meted out by the principal, but excludes those on strike where all the formal requisites for the legality of the strike have been <i>prima facie</i> complied with based on the records filed with the National Conciliation and Mediation Board.</blockquote><br>“Permissible job contracting or subcontracting refers to an arrangement whereby a principal agrees to farm out with a contractor or subcontractor the performance of a specific job, work, or service within a definite or predetermined period, regardless of whether such job, work or, service is to be performed or completed within or outside the premises of the principal.&nbsp; Under this arrangement, the following conditions must be met: (a) the contractor carries on a distinct and independent business and undertakes the contract work on his account under his own responsibility according to his own manner and method, free from the control and direction of his employer or principal in all matters connected with the performance of his work except as to the results thereof; (b) the contractor has substantial capital or investment; and (c) the agreement between the principal and contractor or subcontractor assures the contractual employees’ entitlement to all labor and occupational safety and health standards, free exercise of the right to self-organization, security of tenure, and social welfare benefits.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>&nbsp; Labor-only contracting, on the other hand, is a prohibited act, defined as “supplying workers to an employer who does not have substantial capital or investment in the form of tools, equipment, machineries, work premises, among others, and the workers recruited and placed by such person are performing activities which are directly related to the principal business of such employer.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>&nbsp; “[I]n distinguishing between prohibited labor-only contracting and permissible job contracting, the totality of the facts and the surrounding circumstances of the case shall be considered.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Generally, the contractor is presumed to be a labor-only contractor, unless such contractor overcomes the burden of proving that it has the substantial capital, investment, tools and the like.&nbsp; However, where the principal is the one claiming that the contractor is a legitimate contractor, as in the present case, said principal has the burden of proving that supposed status.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; It is thus incumbent upon Petron, and not upon petitioners as Petron insists, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> to prove that RDG is an independent contractor.<br><br><b><i>Petron failed to discharge the burden<br> of proving that RDG is a legitimate <br>contractor. Hence, the presumption<br> that RDG is a labor-only contractor <br>stands.</i></b><br><br>Here, the audited financial statements and other financial documents of RDG for the years 1999 to 2001 establish that it does have sufficient working capital to meet the requirements of its service contract.&nbsp; In fact, the financial evaluation conducted by Petron of RDG’s financial statements for years 1998-2000 showed RDG to have a maximum financial capability of Php4.807 Million as of December 1998,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> and Php1.611 Million as of December 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>&nbsp; Petron was able to establish RDG’s sufficient capitalization when it entered into the service contract in 2000.&nbsp; The Court stresses though that this determination of RDG’s status as an independent contractor is only with respect to its financial capability for the period covered by the financial and other documents presented.&nbsp; In other words, the evidence adduced merely proves that RDG was financially qualified as a legitimate contractor but only with respect to its last service contract with Petron in the year 2000.<br><br>As may be recalled, petitioners have rendered work for Petron for a long period of time even before the service contract was executed in 2000.&nbsp; The respective dates on which petitioners claim to have started working for Petron, as well as the fact that they have rendered continuous service to it until October 16, 2002, when they were prevented from entering the premises of Petron’s Mandaue Bulk Plant, were not at all disputed by Petron.&nbsp; In fact, Petron even recognized that some of the petitioners were initially fielded by Romualdo Gindang, the father of Romeo, through RDG’s precursor, Romualdo D. Gindang Contractor, while the others were provided by Romeo himself when he took over the business of his father in 1989.&nbsp; Hence, while Petron was able to establish that RDG was financially capable as a legitimate contractor at the time of the execution of the service contract in 2000, it nevertheless failed to establish the financial capability of RDG at the time when petitioners actually started to work for Petron in 1968, 1979, 1981, 1987, 1990, 1992 and 1993.<br><br>Sections 8 and 9, Rule VIII, Book III<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> of the implementing rules of the Labor Code, in force since 1976 and prior to DOLE Department Order No. 10, series of 1997,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> provide that for job contracting to be permissible, one of the conditions that has to be met is that the contractor must have substantial capital or investment.&nbsp; Petron having failed to show that this condition was met by RDG, it can be concluded, on this score alone, that RDG is a mere labor-only contractor. Otherwise stated, the presumption that RDG is a labor-only contractor stands due to the failure of Petron to discharge the burden of proving the contrary.<br><br>The Court also finds, as will be discussed below, that the works performed by petitioners were directly related to Petron’s business, another factor which negates Petron’s claim that RDG is an independent contractor.<br><br><b><i>Petron’s power of control over<br>petitioners exists in this case. </i></b><br><br>“[A] finding that a contractor is a ‘labor-only’ contractor is equivalent to declaring that there is an employer-employee relationship between the principal and the employees of the supposed contractor.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> In this case, the employer-employee relationship between Petron and petitioners becomes all the more apparent due to the presence of the power of control on the part of the former over the latter.<br><br>It was held in<i> Orozco v. The Fifth Division of the Hon. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> that:<br><br><blockquote>This Court has constantly adhered to the “four-fold test” to determine whether there exists an employer-employee relationship between the parties.&nbsp; The four elements of an employment relationship are: (a) the selection and engagement of the employee; (b) the payment of wages; (c) the power of dismissal; and (d) the power to control the employee’s conduct.<br><br><b>Of these four elements, it is the power to control which is the most crucial and most determinative factor, so important, in fact, that, the other elements may even be disregarded.” </b>(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Hence, the facts that petitioners were hired by Romeo or his father and that their salaries were paid by them do not detract from the conclusion that there exists an employer-employee relationship between the parties due to Petron’s power of control over the petitioners.<br><br>One manifestation of the power of control is the power to transfer employees from one work assignment to another.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>&nbsp; Here, Petron could order petitioners to do work outside of their regular “maintenance/utility” job.&nbsp; Also, petitioners were required to report for work everyday at the bulk plant, observe an 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. daily work schedule, and wear proper uniform and safety helmets as prescribed by the safety and security measures being implemented within the bulk plant.&nbsp; All these imply control.&nbsp; In an industry where safety is of paramount concern, control and supervision over sensitive operations, such as those performed by the petitioners, are inevitable if not at all necessary.&nbsp; Indeed, Petron deals with commodities that are highly volatile and flammable which, if mishandled or not properly attended to, may cause serious injuries and damage to property and the environment.&nbsp; Naturally, supervision by Petron is essential in every aspect of its product handling in order not to compromise the integrity, quality and safety of the products that it distributes to the consuming public.<br><br><b><i>Petitioners already attained regular<br>status as employees of Petron.</i></b><br><br>Petitioners were given various work assignments such as tanker receiving, barge loading, sounding, gauging, warehousing, mixing, painting, carpentry, driving, gasul filling and other utility works.&nbsp; Petron refers to these work assignments as menial works which could be performed by any able-bodied individual.&nbsp; The Court finds, however, that while the jobs performed by petitioners may be menial and mechanical, they are nevertheless necessary and related to Petron’s business operations.&nbsp; If not for these tasks, Petron’s products will not reach the consumers in their proper state. Indeed, petitioners’ roles were vital inasmuch as they involve the preparation of the products that Petron will distribute to its consumers.<br><br>Furthermore, while it may be true that any able-bodied individual can perform the tasks assigned to petitioners, the Court notes the undisputed fact that for many years, it was the same able-bodied individuals (petitioners) who performed the tasks for Petron.&nbsp; The engagement of petitioners for the same works for a long period of time is a strong indication that such works were indeed necessary to Petron’s business.&nbsp; In view of these, and considering further that petitioners’ length of service entitles them to become regular employees under the Labor Code, petitioners are deemed by law to have already attained the status as Petron’s regular employees.&nbsp; As such, Petron could not terminate their services on the pretext that the service contract it entered with RDG has already lapsed.&nbsp; For one, and as previously discussed, such regular status had already attached to them even before the execution of the service contract in 2000.&nbsp; For another, the same does not constitute a just or authorized cause for a valid dismissal of regular employees.<br><br>In sum, the Court finds that RDG is a labor-only contractor.&nbsp; As such, it is considered merely as an agent of Petron.&nbsp; Consequently, the employer-employee relationship which the Court finds to exist in this case is between petitioners as employees and Petron as their employer.&nbsp; Petron therefore, being the principal employer and RDG, being the labor-only contractor, are solidarily liable for petitioners’ illegal dismissal and monetary claims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is <b>GRANTED.</b>&nbsp; The May 10, 2006 Decision and March 30, 2007 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
