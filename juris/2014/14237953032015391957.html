				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This labor case involves a seafarer's claim for disability benefits.&nbsp; It involves an application of Section 20(B) of the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration Standard Employment Contract (POEA contract).&nbsp; The POEA contract states that for an illness to be compensable, (1) it must be work-related and (2) it must have existed during the term of the seafarer's employment contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>Joel B.

Cardio-Vascular Diseases. Any of the following conditions must be met:<br><br>a. If the heart disease was known to have been present during employment, there must be proof that an acute exacerbation was clearly precipitated by the unusual strain by reasons of the nature of his work.<br><br>b.&nbsp; The strain of work that brings about an acute attack must be sufficient severity and must be followed within 24 hours by the clinical signs of a cardiac insult to constitute causal relationship.<br><br>c. If a person who was apparently asymptomatic before being subjected to strain at work showed signs and symptoms of cardiac injury during the performance of his work and such symptoms and signs persisted, it is reasonable to claim a causal relationship.<br><br>12. Cerebro-Vascular Accidents. All of the following conditions must be met:<br><br><ol type="a"><li>There must be a history, which should be proved, or trauma at work (to the head specially) due to unusual and extraordinary physical or mental strain or event, or undue exposure to noxious gases in industry.<br><br></li><li> There must be a direct connection between the trauma or exertion in the course of employment and the worker’s collapse.<br><br></li><li>If the trauma or exertion then and there caused a brain hemorrhage, the injury may be considered as arising from work.<br></li></ol>. . . .<br><br>20. Essential Hypertension<br><br>Hypertension classified as primary or essential is considered compensable if it causes impairment of function of body organs like kidneys, heart, eyes and brains, resulting in permanent disability; Provided, that, the following documents substantiate it: (a) chest x-ray report, (b) ECG re[p]ort (c) blood chemistry report, (d) funduscopy report, and (f) C-T scan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup></blockquote><br>The POEA contract also states that “illnesses not listed in Section 32 of this contract are disputably presumed as work related.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>Petitioner argues that all four conditions for compensability under Section 32-A were satisfied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>&nbsp; He discusses the stressful nature of his work considering the changing weather conditions and compounded by being away from loved ones.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup>&nbsp; He mentions that he was declared fit to work after his pre-employment medical examination, thus, he contracted his illness after exposure to the stressful working conditions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup>&nbsp; Lastly, he alleges that there was no notorious negligence on his part.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>Both the National Labor Relations Commission and Court of Appeals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> found that petitioner failed to prove compliance with the conditions under Section 32 of the POEA contract, thus, failing to show a causal connection between his illness and his work.&nbsp; The National Labor Relations Commission discussed as follows:<br><br><blockquote>The main issue that would determine complainant-appellee’s entitlement to permanent disability is whether his illness is work-related or not.&nbsp; We rule in the negative.&nbsp; For one, complainant-appellee failed to discharge the burden of proving the conditions set forth in Section 32-A particularly, that his work as ordinary seaman involved the risks of having a stroke; that complainant-appellee’s hypertension was contracted as a result of his exposure to his work; that the disease was contracted within the period of exposure and such other factors necessary to contract it and that there was no notorious negligence on complainant-appellee’s part.&nbsp; For another and on the contrary, complainant-appellee admitted that he had a family history of hypertension and that he smoked about one pack a day for thirty (30) years.&nbsp; Further, complainant-appellee also failed to prove that his hypertension can be classified as primary or essential; that he has suffered impairments in his vital organs; and that he failed to submit documents to substantiate his claim for compensability.&nbsp; Furthermore, we find that despite the non work relatedness of the illness of complainant-appellee, respondents-appellants in good faith exerted efforts and caused complainant-appellee’s treatment in a foreign country, shouldered his repatriation expenses and caused his examinations and treatment for more than eight (8) months shouldering the expenses therein.<br><br>Under the circumstances, respondents-appellants is not liable for the disability benefits of complainant-appellee considering that his illness of hypertension was not proven by substantial evidence to be work-related.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup></blockquote><br>A petition for review is limited to questions of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup>&nbsp; This court does not “re-examine conflicting evidence, re-evaluate the credibility of witnesses, or substitute the findings of fact of the NLRC, an administrative body that has expertise in its specialized field.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup>&nbsp; This court has held that “factual findings of the NLRC, when affirmed by the Court of Appeals, are generally conclusive on this court.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>Petitioner presents no compelling reason for this court to deviate from this general rule.<br><br>Petitioner’s reliance on Dr. Vicaldo’s medical opinion also fails to convince.&nbsp; Section 20(B)(3) of the POEA contract provides:<br><br><blockquote>3. Upon sign-off from the vessel for medical treatment, the seafarer is entitled to sickness allowance equivalent to his basic wage until he is declared fit to work or the degree of permanent disability has been assessed by the company-designated physician but in no case shall this period exceed one hundred twenty (120) days.<br><br>For this purpose, the seafarer shall submit himself to a post-employment medical examination by a company-designated physician within three working days upon his return except when he is physically incapacitated to do so, in which case, a written notice to the agency within the same period is deemed as compliance.&nbsp; Failure of the seafarer to comply with the mandatory reporting requirement shall result in his forfeiture of the right to claim the above benefits.<br><br><i>If a doctor appointed by the seafarer disagrees with the assessment, a third doctor may be agreed jointly between the Employer and the seafarer.&nbsp; The third doctor’s decision shall be final and binding on both parties</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Petitioner did not consult with a third doctor chosen by both parties.&nbsp; His contention is that the National Labor Relations Commission and Court of Appeals both erred in giving more credence to the assessment of the company-designated physician, Dr. Ong-Salvador, as opposed to the opinion of his private physician, Dr. Vicaldo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>The question of weighing the credibility of two opposing medical opinions involves a factual review beyond the scope of a petition under Rule 45.<br><br>There appears to be no reason to overturn the lower court’s factual findings giving more weight to the assessment of the company-designated physician.<br><br>As discussed by the Court of Appeals, “as between the company-designated doctor who has all the medical records of petitioner for the duration of his treatment and as against the latter’s private doctor who merely examined him for a day as an outpatient, the former’s finding must prevail.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>Several jurisprudence have given more weight to the assessment of the doctor that closely monitored and actually treated the seafarer.<br><br>In <i>Philman Marine v. Cabanban,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> this court gave more credence to the company-designated physician’s assessment since “records show that the medical certifications issued by Armando’s chosen physician were not supported by such laboratory tests and/or procedures that would sufficiently controvert the “normal” results of those administered to Armando at the St. Luke’s Medical Center. . . [while] the medical certificate of the petitioners’ designated physician was issued after three months of closely monitoring Armando’s medical condition and progress, and after careful analysis of the results of the diagnostic tests and procedures administered to Armando while in consultation with Dr. Crisostomo, a cardiologist.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup>&nbsp; Philman discussed as follows:<br><br><blockquote><i>In several cases, we held that the doctor who have had a personal knowledge of the actual medical condition, having closely, meticulously and regularly monitored and actually treated the seafarer’s illness, is more qualified to assess the seafarer’s disability. </i> In <i>Coastal Safeway Marine Services, Inc. v. Esguerra</i>, the Court significantly brushed aside the probative weight of the medical certifications of the private physicians, which were based merely on vague diagnosis and general impressions.&nbsp; Similarly in <i>Ruben D. Andrada v. Agemar Manning Agency, Inc., et al.</i>, the Court accorded greater weight to the assessments of the company-designated physician and the consulting medical specialist which resulted from an extensive examination, monitoring and treatment of the seafarer’s condition, in contrast with the recommendation of the private physician which was “based only on a single medical report . . . [outlining] the alleged findings and medical history . . . obtained after . . . [one examination].”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>In the recent case of <i>Dalusong v. Eagle Clarc Shipping Philippines, Inc.,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> we ruled that “the findings of the company-designated doctor, who, with his team of specialists . . . periodically treated petitioner for months and monitored his condition, deserve greater evidentiary weight than the single medical report of petitioner’s doctor, who appeared to have examined petitioner only once.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>Regardless of who the doctor is and his or her relation to the parties, the overriding consideration by both the Labor Arbiter and the National Labor Relations Commission should be that the medical conclusions are based on (a) the symptoms and findings collated with medically acceptable diagnostic tools and methods, (b) reasonable professional inferences anchored on prevailing scientific findings expected to be known to the physician given his or her level of expertise, and (c) the submitted medical findings or synopsis, supported by plain English annotations that will allow the Labor Arbiter and the National Labor Relations Commission to make the proper evaluation.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals in a petition for review should be limited to determining whether there was grave abuse of discretion committed by the National Labor Relations Commission.<br><br>In this case, the company-designated physician and her associated specialists provided petitioner with extensive medical attention and treatment from January 31, 2007 to August 2007.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup>&nbsp; These are supported by medical reports.<br><br>In Dr. Ong-Salvador’s initial medical report dated January 31, 2007, she provided a chronological history of petitioner’s present illness, mentioning that he had a family history of hypertension on his paternal side, and smoked a pack a day for 30 years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup>&nbsp; She then outlined the results of petitioner’s physical examination and neurological examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup>&nbsp; Under “Working Impression,” the initial medical report states “Hypertension Stage II, ASHD, CAD at risk, S/P Stroke.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup>&nbsp; Under “Plan of Management,” the initial medical report states that petitioner was “admitted at the Santo Tomas Hospital today for further evaluation and management” and that he was “under the care of our specialists.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup>&nbsp; These specialists included neurologist Dr. Generoso D. Licup and cardiologist Dr. Glenn A. Mana-ay who both diagnosed petitioner and provided medical reports on their findings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>In Dr. Ong-Salvador’s reply to medical query dated February 19, 2007, she discussed that “patient’s condition is regarded as non-work related, as the disease is mainly of a heredofamilial etiology that is enhanced by a number of modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup>&nbsp; Dr. Ong-Salvador, having access to all of petitioner’s medical records, was in the best position to make this conclusion.<br><br>Nevertheless, despite the non-work-related nature of petitioner’s condition, respondents continued providing him with medical assistance.<br><br>In Dr. Ong-Salvador’s medical progress report dated April 30, 2007, she discussed that petitioner “has continued with his medical treatment in his province in Iloilo . . . has been under physical therapy sessions to help him recover muscular functions and strength . . . [and] [c]ontinuous physical improvements were noted.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>Dr. Ong-Salvador continued to issue progress reports on petitioner’s examinations with the company-designated cardiologist in Iloilo, and scheduling him for more re-evaluation by their specialists.&nbsp; The medical progress report dated August 21, 2007 stated that petitioner “underwent blood work-ups today [and] he tolerated the procedure well.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, Dr. Vicaldo’s medical certificate provides as follow:<br><br><blockquote><center>JUSTIFICATION OF IMPEDIMENT GRADE VII (41.80%) FOR<br>SEAMAN Joel B.

In fact, Dr. Vicaldo recognizes that petitioner already has a cardiologist and neurologist with whom he should regularly follow up with.<br><br>Dr. Ong-Salvador is familiar with petitioner’s medical history and condition, thus, her medical opinion on whether his illness is work-aggravated/-related deserves more credence as opposed to Dr. Efren Vicaldo’s unsupported conclusions.<br><br>This court notes that in several cases filed before this court on seafarer’s disability claims, Dr. Vicaldo’s findings have not been given due merit due to their unsubstantiated nature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>It, therefore, behooves the National Labor Relations Commission, perhaps, to cause an investigation on why, in spite of the unsupported nature of Dr. Vicaldo’s submissions, Labor Arbiters still give him credence.&nbsp; This unnecessarily clogs their administrative dockets, and the dockets of the Court of Appeals and this court.&nbsp; Judicial efficiency requires that Labor Arbiters and the National Labor Relations Commission keep guard against these types of doctors and their medical findings.<br><br>Since petitioner’s illness is not work-related, this court need not labor on petitioner’s argument that his illness must be deemed total and permanent since 240 days had lapsed without any assessment by the company-designated physician on his fitness to work.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup><br><br>We observe that most seafarer complaints for compensation pursue the cause of action petitioner took in this case — breach of contractual obligations by its employer by invoking provisions of the POEA contract.&nbsp; This course follows a procedure that considers a balance of interests in the amount of compensation for the occupational hazards a seafarer suffers, and the process to recover such compensation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><br>Seafarers who suffer from occupational hazards are not necessarily constrained to contractual breach as cause of action in claiming compensation.&nbsp; Our laws allow seafarers, in a proper case, to seek damages based on tortious violations by their employers by invoking Civil Code provisions, and even special laws such as environmental regulations requiring employers to ensure the reduction of risks to occupational hazards.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup><br><br>Lastly, petitioner failed to substantiate his claim for attorney’s fees.&nbsp; Attorney’s fees are awarded by way of exception when a defendant acted in evident and gross bad faith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br><br>Quite the opposite, “respondents merely relied on the company-designated physician’s finding that petitioner’s illness was not work-related [and] [d]espite of [sic] such finding, private respondents still extended to petitioner the required medical assistance and therapy.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><br><br>Respondents also submit that they already paid petitioner illness allowance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup>&nbsp; Respondents’ comment attached copies of approved illness allowance payments for petitioner in the amounts of US$555.87 for January and February 2007, US$589.29 for February and March 2007, and US$854.84 for April and May 2007.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup><br><br>Petitioner no longer mentioned illness allowance in his memorandum.&nbsp; This court’s resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> requiring the filing of memoranda explained that “issues raised in the pleadings but not included in the memorandum shall be deemed waived or abandoned.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup><br><br>This court’s commitment to provide full protection to labor “does not prevent us from sustaining the employer when it is in the right.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup>&nbsp; In any event, the lower court has awarded US$3,000.00 as financial assistance in the interest of equity and compassionate justice.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals’ decision and resolution are <b>AFFIRMED.</b><br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><i><br>Carpio, (Chairperson), Brion, Del Castillo,</i> and&nbsp;
