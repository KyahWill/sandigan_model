Omar (<i>Omar</i>) filed a Petition to Deny Due Course or Cancel Hayudini’s CoC, entitled<i> Mustapha J. Omar v. Gamal S. Hayudini,</i> docketed as SPA No. 13-106(DC)(F).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>&nbsp; Omar basically asserted that Hayudini should be disqualified for making false representation regarding his residence.&nbsp; He claimed that Hayudini declared in his CoC that he is a resident of the Municipality of South Ubian when, in fact, he resides in Zamboanga City.<br><br>Thereafter, on November 30, 2012, Hayudini filed a Petition for Inclusion in the Permanent List of Voters in <i>Barangay</i> Bintawlan, South Ubian before the Municipal Circuit Trial Court (<i>MCTC</i>).&nbsp; Despite the opposition of Ignacio Aguilar Baki, the MCTC granted Hayudini’s petition on January 31, 2013.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>&nbsp; On that same day, the COMELEC’s First Division dismissed<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Omar’s earlier petition to cancel Hayudini’s CoC in SPA No. 13-106(DC)(F) for lack of substantial evidence that Hayudini committed false representation as to his residency.<br><br>Oppositor Baki, subsequently, elevated the case to the Bongao Regional Trial Court (<i>RTC</i>), Branch 5.&nbsp; The RTC, on March 8, 2013, reversed<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> the MCTC ruling and ordered the deletion of Hayudini’s name in Barangay Bintawlan’s permanent list of voters.&nbsp; In view of said decision, Omar filed before the COMELEC a Petition to Cancel the Certificate of Candidacy of Gamal S. Hayudini by Virtue of a Supervening Event on March 26, 2013.&nbsp; The petition was docketed as SPA No. 13-249(DC)(F).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>&nbsp; Hayudini appealed the March 8, 2013 RTC decision to the Court of Appeals (<i>CA</i>), but on April 17, 2013, in CA-G.R. SP No. 05426,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> the same was denied.<br><br>On May 13, 2013, Hayudini won the mayoralty race in South Ubian, Tawi-Tawi.&nbsp; He was proclaimed and, consequently, took his oath of office.<br><br>On June 20, 2013, the COMELEC Second Division issued a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> granting Omar’s second petition to cancel Hayudini’s CoC.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the COMELEC Resolution reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the instant petition is hereby <b>GRANTED</b>.&nbsp; Accordingly, the Certificate of Candidacy filed by Gamal S. Hayudini as Mayor of South Ubian, Tawi-Tawi, in the 13 May 2013 elections, is hereby <b><b>CANCELLED</b></b>.<br><br>The Office of the Deputy Executive Director for Operations is hereby directed to constitute a Special Board of Canvassers for the purpose of proclaiming the lawful winner for mayoralty position in South Ubian, Tawi-Tawi during the 13 May 2013 elections.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Hayudini, thus, filed a Motion for Reconsideration with the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i>, arguing that its Second Division committed grave error when it gave due course to a belatedly filed petition and treated the March 8, 2013 RTC Decision as a supervening event.<br><br>On July 10, 2013, the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> denied Hayudini’s Motion for Reconsideration for lack of merit.&nbsp; The decretal portion of the <i>En Banc’s</i> assailed Resolution states:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the Commission RESOLVED, as it hereby <b>RESOLVES</b> to <b><u>DENY</u></b> this Motion for Reconsideration for <b>LACK OF MERIT</b>.&nbsp; Consequently, the June 20, 2013 Resolution of the Commission (Second Division) is hereby affirmed.<br><br>Corollary thereto, the proclamation of respondent <i>GAMAL S.

In case of a substitute candidate, the Petition must be filed within five (5) days from the time the substitute candidate filed his certificate of candidacy.<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>Section 4. <i>Procedure to be observed</i></b>. — Both parties shall observe the following procedure:<br><ol><li>The petitioner shall, before filing of the Petition, furnish a copy of the Petition, through personal service to the respondent. In cases where personal service is not feasible, or the respondent refuses to receive the Petition, or the respondents’ whereabouts cannot be ascertained, the petitioner shall execute an affidavit stating the reason or circumstances therefor and resort to registered mail as a mode of service. The proof of service or the affidavit shall be attached to the Petition to be filed;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></li></ol></blockquote><br>Here, Hayudini filed his CoC on October 5, 2012, which was also the last day of filing of CoC for the May 13, 2013 elections.&nbsp; Omar, on the other hand, filed the subject petition only on March 26, 2013.&nbsp; Under the COMELEC Rules, a Petition to Deny Due Course or Cancel CoC must be filed within five days from the last day for filing a certificate of candidacy, but not later than twenty-five days from the time of filing of the CoC subject of the petition.&nbsp; Clearly, Omar’s petition was filed way beyond the prescribed period. Likewise, he failed to provide sufficient explanation as to why his petition was not served personally to Hayudini.<br><br>Notwithstanding the aforementioned procedural missteps, the Court sustains the COMELEC’s liberal treatment of Omar’s petition.<br><br>As a general rule, statutes providing for election contests are to be liberally construed in order that the will of the people in the choice of public officers may not be defeated by mere technical objections.&nbsp; Moreover, it is neither fair nor just to keep in office, for an indefinite period, one whose right to it is uncertain and under suspicion.&nbsp; It is imperative that his claim be immediately cleared, not only for the benefit of the winner but for the sake of public interest, which can only be achieved by brushing aside technicalities of procedure that protract and delay the trial of an ordinary action.&nbsp; This principle was reiterated in the cases of <i>Tolentino v. Commission on Elections</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> and <i>De Castro v. Commission on Elections</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> where the Court held that “in exercising its powers and jurisdiction, as defined by its mandate to protect the integrity of elections, the COMELEC must not be straitjacketed by procedural rules in resolving election disputes.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Settled is the rule that the COMELEC Rules of Procedure are subject to liberal construction.&nbsp; The COMELEC has the power to liberally interpret or even suspend its rules of procedure in the interest of justice, including obtaining a speedy disposition of all matters pending before it.&nbsp; This liberality is for the purpose of promoting the effective and efficient implementation of its objectives - ensuring the holding of free, orderly, honest, peaceful, and credible elections, as well as achieving just, expeditious, and inexpensive determination and disposition of every action and proceeding brought before the COMELEC.&nbsp; Unlike an ordinary civil action, an election contest is imbued with public interest.&nbsp; It involves not only the adjudication of private and pecuniary interests of rival candidates, but also the paramount need of dispelling the uncertainty which beclouds the real choice of the electorate.&nbsp; And the tribunal has the corresponding duty to ascertain, by all means within its command, whom the people truly chose as their rightful leader.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Indeed, Omar had previously filed a Petition to Deny Due Course or Cancel Hayudini’s CoC on October 15, 2012, docketed as SPA No. 13-106(DC)(F).&nbsp; This was dismissed on January 31, 2013, or the same day the MCTC granted Hayudini’s petition to be included in the list of voters.&nbsp; However, on March 8, 2013, the RTC reversed the MCTC ruling and, consequently, ordered the deletion of Hayudini’s name in Barangay Bintawlan’s permanent list of voters.&nbsp; Said deletion was already final and executory under the law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; Hayudini, however, still appealed the case to the CA, which was subsequently denied.&nbsp; Notably, thereafter, he went to the CA again, this time to file a petition for<i> certiorari,</i> docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 05499.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; In a Resolution dated July 9, 2013, the CA also denied said petition primarily because of Hayudini’s act of engaging in the pernicious practice of forum shopping by filing two modes of appeal before said court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; Hence, by virtue of the finality of said RTC decision deleting his name from the voters’ list, Hayudini, who had been previously qualified under the law<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> to run for an elective position, was then rendered ineligible.<br><br>Given the finality of the RTC decision, the same should be considered a valid supervening event.&nbsp; A supervening event refers to facts and events transpiring after the judgment or order had become executory.&nbsp; These circumstances affect or change the substance of the judgment and render its execution inequitable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; Here, the RTC’s March 8, 2013 decision, ordering the deletion of Hayudini’s name in the list of voters, which came after the dismissal of Omar’s first petition, is indubitably a supervening event which would render the execution of the ruling in SPA No. 13-106(DC)(F) iniquitous and unjust.&nbsp; As the COMELEC aptly ruled, the decision to exclude Hayudini was still non-existent when the COMELEC first promulgated the Resolution in SPA No. 13-106(DC)(F) on January 31, 2013, or when the issues involved therein were passed upon.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; The First Division even expressed that although the Election Registration Board (ERB) denied Hayudini’s application for registration, it could not adopt the same because it was not yet final as Hayudini was still to file a Petition for Inclusion before the MCTC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, it is not far-fetched to say that had this final RTC finding been existent before, the COMELEC First Division could have taken judicial notice of it and issued a substantially different ruling in SPA No. 13-106(DC)(F).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>The same ruling adequately equipped Omar with the necessary ground to successfully have Hayudini’s CoC struck down.&nbsp; Under the rules, a statement in a certificate of candidacy claiming that a candidate is eligible to run for public office when in truth he is not, is a false material representation, a ground for a petition under Section 78 of the Omnibus Election Code.<br><br>Sections 74 and 78 read:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 74. <i>Contents of certificate of candidacy. </i>– The certificate of candidacy shall state that the person filing it is announcing his candidacy for the office stated therein and that he is eligible for said office; if for Member of the <i>Batasang Pambansa</i>, the province, including its component cities, highly urbanized city or district or sector which he seeks to represent; the political party to which he belongs; civil status; his date of birth; residence; his post office address for all election purposes; his profession or occupation; that he will support and defend the Constitution of the Philippines and will maintain true faith and allegiance thereto; that he will obey the laws, legal orders, and decrees promulgated by the duly constituted authorities; that he is not a permanent resident or immigrant to a foreign country; that the obligation imposed by his oath is assumed voluntarily, without mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that the facts stated in the certificate of candidacy are true to the best of his knowledge.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Sec. 78. <i>Petition to deny due course to or cancel a certificate of candidacy.</i> – A verified petition seeking to deny due course or to cancel a certificate of candidacy may be filed by the person exclusively on the ground that any material representation contained therein as required under Section 74 hereof is false. The petition may be filed at any time not later than twenty-five days from the time of the filing of the certificate of candidacy and shall be decided, after due notice and hearing, not later than fifteen days before the election.</blockquote><br>The false representation mentioned in these provisions must pertain to a material fact, not to a mere innocuous mistake.&nbsp; A candidate who falsifies a material fact cannot run; if he runs and is elected, cannot serve; in both cases, he or she can be prosecuted for violation of the election laws.&nbsp; These facts pertain to a candidate's qualification for elective office, such as his or her citizenship and residence.&nbsp; Similarly, the candidate's status as a registered voter falls under this classification as it is a legal requirement which must be reflected in the CoC.&nbsp; The reason for this is obvious: the candidate, if he or she wins, will work for and represent the local government under which he or she is running.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; Even the will of the people, as expressed through the ballot, cannot cure the vice of ineligibility, especially if they mistakenly believed, as in the instant case, that the candidate was qualified.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Aside from the requirement of materiality, a false representation under Section 78 must consist of a "deliberate attempt to mislead, misinform, or hide a fact which would otherwise render a candidate ineligible."&nbsp; Simply put, it must be made with a malicious intent to deceive the electorate as to the potential candidate's qualifications for public office.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Section 74 requires the candidate to state under oath in his CoC "that he is eligible for said office."&nbsp; A candidate is eligible if he has a right to run for the public office.&nbsp; If a candidate is not actually eligible because he is not a registered voter in the municipality where he intends to be elected, but still he states under oath in his certificate of candidacy that he is eligible to run for public office, then the candidate clearly makes a false material representation, a ground to support a petition under Section 78.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; It is interesting to note that Hayudini was, in fact, initially excluded by the ERB as a voter.&nbsp; On November 30, 2012, the ERB issued a certificate confirming the disapproval of Hayudini’s petition for registration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>&nbsp; This is precisely the reason why he needed to file a Petition for Inclusion in the Permanent List of Voters in <i>Barangay</i> Bintawlan before the MCTC.&nbsp; Thus, when he stated in his CoC that “he is eligible for said office," Hayudini made a clear and material misrepresentation as to his eligibility, because he was not, in fact, registered as a voter in <i>Barangay</i> Bintawlan.<br><br>Had the COMELEC not given due course to Omar’s petition solely based on procedural deficiencies, South Ubian would have a mayor who is not even a registered voter in the locality he is supposed to govern, thereby creating a ridiculously absurd and outrageous situation.&nbsp; Hence, the COMELEC was accurate in cancelling Hayudini’s certificate of candidacy.<br><br>Hayudini likewise protests that it was a grave error on the part of the COMELEC to have declared his proclamation null and void when no petition for annulment of his proclamation was ever filed.&nbsp; What petitioner seems to miss, however, is that the nullification of his proclamation as a winning candidate is also a legitimate outcome - a necessary legal consequence - of the cancellation of his CoC pursuant to Section 78. A CoC cancellation proceeding essentially partakes of the nature of a disqualification case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; The cancellation of a CoC essentially renders the votes cast for the candidate whose certificate of candidacy has been cancelled as stray votes.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; If the disqualification or CoC cancellation or denial case is not resolved before the election day, the proceedings shall continue even after the election and the proclamation of the winner.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the candidate may be voted for and even be proclaimed as the winner, but the COMELEC's jurisdiction to deny due course and cancel his or her CoC continues.&nbsp; This rule likewise applies even if the candidate facing disqualification has already taken his oath of office.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; The only exception to this rule is in the case of congressional and senatorial candidates where the COMELEC <i>ipso jure</i> loses jurisdiction in favor of either the Senate or the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal after the candidates have been proclaimed, taken the proper oath, and also assumed&nbsp; office.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>It bears stressing that one of the requirements for a mayoralty candidate is that he must be a resident of the city or municipality where he intends to be elected.&nbsp; Thus, under Section 74 of the Omnibus Election Code, it is required that a candidate must certify under oath that he is eligible for the public office he seeks election.&nbsp; In this case, when petitioner stated in<br><br>his CoC that he is a resident of Barangay Bintawlan, South Ubian, Tawi Tawi and eligible for a public office, but it turned out that he was declared to be a non-resident thereof in a petition for his inclusion in the list of registered voters, he therefore committed a false representation in his CoC which pertained to a material fact which is a ground for the cancellation of his CoC under Section 78 of the Omnibus Election Code. Petitioner's ineligibility for not being a resident of the place he sought election is not a ground for a petition for disqualification, since the grounds enumerated under Section 68<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> of the Omnibus Election Code specifically refer to the commission of prohibited acts, and possession of a permanent resident status in a foreign country.<br><br>As held in <i>Aratea v. COMELEC</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> which is a case for cancellation of CoC under Section 78 of the Omnibus Election Code, a cancelled certificate of candidacy void <i>ab initio</i> cannot give rise to a valid candidacy, and much less to valid votes. Whether a certificate of candidacy is cancelled before or after the elections is immaterial, because the cancellation on such ground means he was never a candidate from the very beginning, his certificate of candidacy being void <i>ab initio. </i> We then found that since the winning mayoralty candidate's certificate of candidacy was void <i>ab initio</i>, he was never a candidate at all and all his votes were considered stray votes, and thus, proclaimed the second placer, the only qualified candidate, who actually garnered the highest number of votes, for the position of Mayor.<br><br>We find the factual mileu of the <i>Aratea</i> case applicable in the instant case, since this is also a case for a petition to deny due course or cancel a certificate of candidacy.&nbsp; Since Hayudini was never a valid candidate for the position of the Municipal Mayor of South Ubian, Tawi-Tawi, the votes cast for him should be considered stray votes, Consequently, the COMELEC properly proclaimed Salma Omar, who garnered the highest number of votes in the remaining qualified candidates for the mayoralty post, as the duly-elected Mayor of South Ubian, Tawi Tawi.<br><br><i>Codilla v. De Venecia </i>case has no application in this case, since it dealt with a petition for disqualification under Section 68 of the Omnibus Election Code and not a petition to deny due course or cancel certificate of candidacy under Section 78 which is the case at bar.<br><br>Finally, contrary to Hayudini's belief, the will of the electorate is still actually respected even when the votes for the ineligible candidate are disregarded. The votes cast in favor of the ineligible candidate are not considered at all in determining the winner of an election for these do not constitute the sole and total expression of&nbsp; the sovereign voice. On the other hand, those votes for the eligible and legitimate candidates&nbsp; form an integral part of said voice, which must equally be given due respect , if not more.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is<b> DISMISSED</b>.

Hayudini's <i>Certificate of Candidacy </i>(CoC) and the proclamation by COMELEC of Salma A. Omar as duly elected Mayor of South Ubian, Tawi-Tawi. I take exception, however, to the sweeping opinion in the <i>ponencia</i> that "whether a certificate of candidacy is cancelled before or after the elections is <u>immaterial</u> (to determine the validity of the votes cast), because the cancellation on such ground means he was never a candidate from the very beginning, his certificate of candidacy being void <i>ab initio.</i>” On the contrary, by virtue of the provisions of Section 7 in relation to Section 6, both of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 6646, there should be a distinction in the treatment of votes cast where the petition for cancellation of the certificate of candidacy had been finally adjudicated before the election and where said petition remained pending during the election.<br><br>Hence, I do not agree with the opinion of Mr. Justice Arturo D. Brion that "In a <b>CoC cancellation</b> proceeding, the law is silent on the legal effect of a judgment cancelling the CoC and does not also provide any temporal distinction,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and that in <i>Fermin v. Commission on Elections</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> the Court held that "Section 7 cannot be construed to refer to Section 6 which does not provide for a procedure but for the effects of disqualification, but can only refer to the procedure provided in Section 5 of [R.A. 6646] on nuisance candidates." This opinion is also anchored on the application, without qualification, of the aforementioned principle: that the cancellation of the certificate of candidacy renders it void <i>ab initio,</i> and if said cancellation takes effect after election, it should be given retroactive effect so as to nullify the votes cast for the ineligible candidate. I submit that the issue of whether Section 6 should be applied to a petition for cancellation of a certificate of candidacy pursuant to Section 7, particularly, in determining whether or not to consider stray the votes cast, should not be based on said technical ground, but should take into consideration the primordial principle that the sanctity of the expression of the people's will through the ballot must be preserved. Accordingly, the time of cancellation of the certificate of candidacy, whether it occurs before or after the election, is a material factor to consider in deciding whether to nullify the votes already cast. That is the intent and import of the language of Section 7 in relation to Section 6 which should be given effect.<br><br>Section 5 of R.A. No. 6646 provides for the Procedure in Cases of Nuisance Candidates. Whereas, Sections 6 and 7 of the same law read:<br><br><blockquote><b>Sec. 6. <i>Effect of Disqualification Case</i>.</b> - Any candidate who has been <b>declared by final judgment</b> to be disqualified shall not be voted for, and the votes cast for him shall not be counted. If for any reason a candidate is <b>not declared by final judgment</b> before an election to be disqualified and he is voted for and receives the winning number of votes in such election, the Court or Commission shall <b>continue with the trial and hearing of the action, inquiry, or protest and, upon motion of the complainant or any intervenor, may during the pendency thereof order the suspension of the proclamation of such candidate</b> whenever the evidence of his guilt is strong.

(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>With all due'respect, the Court did not categorically resolve or decide in <i>Fermin</i> that "<i>Section 7 cannot be construed to refer to Section 6"</i> but merely quoted that part of the Dissenting Opinion of then Chief Justice Hilario G. Davide, Jr. in <i>Aquino v. Commission on Elections</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> The issue in <i>Fermin</i> is the timeliness of the filing of the petition under Section 78 and not the effect of the pendency of the said petition during election day to the votes cast.<br><br><i>Fermin</i> was a consolidation of two petitions for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 64 in relation to Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, namely, G.R. No. 179695 and G.R. No. 182369, both filed by Mike A. Fermin to assail several resolutions of the COMELEC. Quoted <i>verbatim</i> hereunder are the relevant facts and findings of the Court in the two consolidated cases, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>After the creation of Shariff Kabunsuan, the Regional Assembly of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), on November 22, 2006, passed Autonomy Act No. 205 creating the Municipality of Northern Kabuntalan in Shariff Kabunsuan. This new municipality was constituted by separating <i>Barangays</i> Balong, Damatog, Gayonga, Guiawa, Indatuan, Kapinpilan, P. Labio, Libungan, Montay, Sabaken and Tumaguinting from the Municipality of Kabuntalan.<br><br>Mike A. Fermin, the petitioner in both cases, was a registered voter of <i>Barangay </i>Payan, Kabuntalan. On December 13, 2006, claiming that he had been a resident of <i>Barangay</i> Indatuan for 1 year and 6 months, petitioner applied with the COMELEC for the transfer of his registration record to the said <i>barangay</i>. In the meantime, the creation of North Kabuntalan was ratified in a plebiscite on December 30, 2006, formally making <i>Barangay</i> Indatuan a component of Northern Kabuntalan.<br><br>Thereafter, on January 8, 2007, the COMELEC approved petitioner's application for the transfer of his voting record and registration as a voter to Precinct 21A of <i>Barangay</i> Indatuan, Northern Kabuntalan. On March 29, 2007, Fermin filed his Certificate of Candidacy (CoC) for mayor of Northern Kabuntalan in the May 14, 2007 National and Local Elections.<br><br>On April 20, 2007, private respondent Umbra Ramil Bayam Dilangalen, another mayoralty candidate, filed a <i>Petition for Disqualification</i> [the Dilangalen petition] against Fermin, docketed as SPA (PES) No. A07-003 [re-docketed as SPA No. 07-372 before the COMELEC] with the Office of the Provincial Election Supervisor of Shariff Kabunsuan. The petition alleged that the petitioner did not possess the period of residency required for candidacy and that he perjured himself in his CoC and in his application for transfer of voting record.<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b><u>Elections were held without any decision being rendered by the COMELEC in the said case. After the counting and canvassing of votes, Dilangalen emerged as the victor with 1,849 votes over Fermin's 1,640</u></b>. The latter subsequently filed an election protest (Election Case No. 2007-022) with the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 13 of Cotabato City.</blockquote><br>The issues that the Court resolved in the consolidated cases were as follows:<br><br><blockquote>(1) <b><u>Whether or not the Dilangalen petition is one under Section 68 or Section 78 of the OEC;</u></b><br><br>(2) <u><b>Whether or not it was filed on time;</b></u><br><br>(3) Whether or not the COMELEC gravely abuse its discretion when it declared petitioner as not a resident of the locality for at least one year prior to the May 14, 2007 elections; and<br><br>(4) Whether or not the COMELEC gravely abuse its discretion when it ordered the dismissal of Election Case No. 07-022 on the ground that Fermin had no legal standing to file the protest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> (Emphases supplied.)</blockquote><br>In granting the petitions, the Court held in the consolidated cases that:<br><br><blockquote><center>I.</center><br>Pivotal in the ascertainment of the timeliness of the Dilangalen petition is its proper characterization.<br><br>As aforesaid, petitioner, on the one hand, argues that the Dilangalen petition was filed pursuant to Section 78 of the OEC; while private respondent counters that the same is based on Section 68 of the Code.<br><br>After studying the said petition in detail, the Court finds that the same is in the nature of a petition to deny due course to or cancel a CoC under Section 78 of the OEC. The petition contains the essential allegations of a "Section 78" petition, namely: (1) the candidate made a representation in his certificate; (2) the representation pertains to a material matter which would affect the substantive rights of the candidate (the right to run for the election for which he filed his certificate); and (3) the candidate made the false representation with the intention to deceive the electorate as to his qualification for public office or deliberately attempted to mislead, misinform, or hide a fact which would otherwise render him ineligible. It likewise appropriately raises a question on a candidate's eligibility for public office, in this case, his possession of the one-year residency requirement under the law.<br><br>Lest it be misunderstood, the denial of due course to or the cancellation of the CoC is <i>not based on the lack of qualifications but on a finding that the candidate made a material representation that is false, which may relate to the qualifications required of the public office he/she is running for</i>. It is noted that the candidate states in his/her CoC that he/she is eligible for the office he/she seeks. <b>Section 78 of the OEC, therefore, is to be read in relation to the constitutional and statutory provisions on qualifications or eligibility for public office. If the candidate subsequently states a material representation in the CoC that is false, the COMELEC, following the law, is empowered to deny due course to or cancel such certificate</b>. Indeed, the Court has already likened a proceeding under Section 78 to<i> a quo warranto</i> proceeding under Section 253 of the OEC since they both deal with the eligibility or qualification of a candidate, with the distinction mainly in the fact that a "Section 78" petition is filed before proclamation, while a petition for <i>quo warranto </i>is filed after proclamation of the winning candidate.<br><br>At this point, we must stress that a "Section 78" petition ought not to be interchanged or confused with a "Section 68" petition. <b>They are different remedies, based on different grounds, and resulting in different eventualities</b>. Private respondent's insistence, therefore, that the petition it filed before the COMELEC in SPA No. 07-372 is in the nature of a disqualification case under Section 68, as it is in fact captioned a "Petition for Disqualification," does not persuade the Court.<br><br>The ground raised in the Dilangalen petition is that Fermin allegedly lacked one of the qualifications to be elected as mayor of Northern Kabuntalan, <i>i.e.</i>, he had not established residence in the said locality for at least one year immediately preceding the election. Failure to meet the one-year residency requirement for the public office <i>is not a ground for the "disqualification" of a candidate under Section 63. The provision only refers to the commission of prohibited acts and the possession of a permanent resident status in a foreign country</i> as grounds for disqualification x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Likewise, the other provisions of law referring to "disqualification" do not include the lack of the one-year residency qualification as a ground therefor x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Considering that the Dilangalen petition does not state any of these grounds for disqualification, it cannot be categorized as a "Section 68" petition.<br><br>To emphasize, a petition for disqualification, on the one hand, can be premised on Section 12 or 68 of the OEC, or Section 40 of the LGC. On the other hand, a petition to deny due course to or cancel a CoC can only be grounded on a statement of a material representation in the said certificate that is false. The petitions also have different effects. While a person who is disqualified under Section 68 is merely prohibited to continue as a candidate, the person whose certificate is cancelled or denied due course under Section 78 is not treated as a candidate at all, as if he/she never filed a CoC. Thus, in <i>Miranda v. Abaya</i>, this Court made the distinction that a candidate who is disqualified under Section 68 can validly be substituted under Section 77 of the OEC because he/she remains a candidate until disqualified; but a person whose CoC has been denied due course or cancelled under Section 78 cannot be substituted because he/she is never considered a candidate.<br><br>In support of his claim that he actually filed a "petition for disquafification" and not a "petition to deny due course to or cancel a CoC," Dilangalen takes refuge in Rule 25 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>We disagree. A COMELEC rule or resolution cannot supplant or vary the legislative enactments that distinguish the grounds for disqualification from those of ineligibility, and the appropriate proceedings to raise the said grounds. In other words, Rule 25 and COMELEC Resolution No. 7800 cannot supersede the dissimilar requirements of the law for the filing of a petition for disqualification under Section 68, and a petition for the denial of due course to or cancellation of CoC under Section 78 of the OEC x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Furthermore, the procedure laid down in the said Rule 25 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure cannot be used in "Section 78" proceedings, precisely because a different rule, Rule 23, specifically governs petitions to deny due course to or cancel CoCs.<br><br><center>II.</center><br>Having thus determined that the Dilangalen petition is one under Section 78 of the OEC, the Court now declares that the same has to comply with the 25-day statutory period for its filing. <i>Aznar v. Commission on Elections</i> and <i>Loong v. Commission on Elections</i> give ascendancy to the express mandate of the law that "the petition may be filed at any time <b>not later than twenty-five days from the time of the filing of the certificate of candidacy.</b>" Construed in relation to reglementary periods and the principles of prescription, the dismissal of "Section 78" petitions filed beyond the 25-day period must come as a matter of course.<br><br><b><u>We find it necessary to point out that Sections 5 and 7 of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 6646, contrary to the erroneous arguments of both parties, did not in any way amend the period for filing "Section 78" petitions</u></b>. While Section 7 of the said law makes reference to Section 5 on the procedure in the conduct of cases for the denial of due course to the CoCs of nuisance candidates (retired Chief Justice Hilario G. Davide, Jr., in his dissenting opinion in <i>Aquino v. Commission on Elections</i> explains that "the 'procedure hereinabove provided' mentioned in Section 7 cannot be construed to refer to Section 6 which does not provide for a procedure but for the effects of disqualification cases, [but] can only refer to the procedure provided in Section 5 of the said Act on nuisance candidates x .x x."), the same cannot be taken to mean that the 25-day period for filing "Section 78" petitions under the OEC is changed to 5 days counted from the last day for the filing of CoCs. The clear language of Section 78 certainly cannot be amended or modified by the mere reference in a subsequent statute to the use of a procedure specifically intended for another type of action. Cardinal is the rule in statutory construction that repeals by implication are disfavored and will not be so declared by the Court unless the intent of the legislators is manifest. In addition, it is noteworthy that<i> Loong</i>, which upheld the 25-day period for filing "Section 78" petitions, was decided long after the enactment of R.A. 6646. In this regard, we therefore find as contrary to the unequivocal mandate of the law, Rule 23, Section 2 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure which states:<br><blockquote>Sec. 2. <i>Period lo File Pelilion</i>. -The petition must be filed within five (5) days following the last day for the filing of certificates of candidacy.<br></blockquote>As the law stands, the petition to deny due course to or cancel a CoC "<b>may be filed at any time not later than twenty-five days from the time of the filing of the certificate of candidacy.</b>"<br><br>Accordingly, it is necessary to determine when Fermin filed his CoC in order to ascertain whether the Dilangalen petition filed on April 20, 2007 was well within the restrictive 25-day period. If it was not, then the COMELEC should have, as discussed above, dismissed the petition outright.<br><br>The record in these cases reveals that Fermin filed his CoC for mayor of Northern Kabuntalan for the May 14, 2007 National and Local Elections on <b>March 29, 2007</b>. It is clear therefore that the petition to deny due course to or cancel Fermiir s CoC was filed by Dilangalen well within the 25-day reglementary period. The COMELEC therefore did not abuse its discretion, much more gravely, when it did not dismiss the petition outright.</blockquote><br>From the aforequoted decision, it cannot be categorically asserted that the Court has ruled that "Section 7 cannot be construed to refer to Section 6" of R.A. No. 6646. Justice Brion cannot definitely state, using as basis the case of <i>Fermin</i>, that my conclusion — that the instruction in Section 7 in relation to Section 6 of R.A. No. 6646 is that the effects of a disqualification case apply to petitions to deny due course to or cancel CoCs — is wrong. What the Court did in <i>Fermin</i> was merely <b>"to point out that Sections 5 and 7 of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 6646, contrary to the erroneous arguments of both parties, did not in any way amend the period for filing 'Section 78' petitions."</b> Admittedly, while the Court made mention therein that "Section 7 of the said law makes reference to Section 5 on the procedure in the conduct of cases for the denial of due course to the CoCs of nuisance candidates," the Ponente of the decision hastened to add that such statement was lifted from the Dissenting Opinion of then Chief Justice Hilario G. Davide, Jr. relative to the case of <i>Aquino v. Commission on Elections</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> This portion of the decision in <i>Fermin</i> is an <i>obiter dictum</i> and in no way definitive of the resolution of the present case for the issues in <i>Fermin</i> are vastly dissimilar to this case.<br><br>Moreover, a close examination of the provisions of Sections 5 and 6 will show that both contain procedural rules, even if Section 6 is entitled "Effect of Disqualification Case." Note that Section 6 adverts to the continuation of the trial, hearing of the action, inquiry or protest and the filing of motion for suspension of the proceedings. Furthermore, if the intent is to limit the application of Section 7 to Section 5, Section 7 should have immediately followed Section 5 in order to exclude from its application Section 6. On the contrary, Section 7 refers to the procedure hereinabove provided. "Hereinabove" or above Section 7 are found Sections 5 and 6.<br><br>Hence, instead of relying on the dissenting opinion of former Chief Justice Davide, I subscribe to the validity of the majority opinion written by Mr. Justice Santiago M. Kapunan in <i>Aquino</i>, which stated that —<br><br><blockquote>Petitioner conveniently confuses the distinction between an unproclaimed candidate to the House of Representatives and a member of the same. Obtaining the highest number of votes in an election does not automatically vest the position in the winning candidate. Section 17 of Article VI of the 1987 Constitution reads:<br><blockquote>The Senate and the House of Representatives shall have an Electoral Tribunal which shall be the sole judge of all contests relating to the election, returns and qualifications of their respective Members.</blockquote>Under the above-stated provision, the electoral tribunal clearly assumes jurisdiction over all contests relative to the election, returns and qualifications of candidates for either the Senate or the House only when the latter become <i>members</i> of either the Senate or the House of Representatives. A candidate who has not been proclaimed and who has not taken his oath of office cannot be said to be a member of the House of Representatives subject to Section 17 of Article VI of the Constitution.<br><br>While the proclamation of a winning candidate in an election is ministerial, B.P. 881 in conjunction with Sec. 6 of R.A. 6646 allows suspension of proclamation under circumstances mentioned therein. Thus, petitioner's contention that "after the conduct of the election and (petitioner) has been established the winner of the electoral exercise from the moment of election, the COMELEC is automatically divested of authority to pass upon the question of qualification" finds no basis in law, because even <i>after</i> the elections the COMELEC is empowered by Section 6 (in relation to Section 7) of R.A. 6646 to continue to hear and decide questions relating to qualifications of candidates. Section 6 states:<br><blockquote>Sec. 6. <i>Effect of Disqualification Case. </i>— Any candidate who has been declared by final judgment to be disqualified shall not be voted for, and the votes cast for him shall not be counted. If for any reason a candidate is not declared by final judgment before an election to be disqualified and he is voted for and receives the winning number of votes in such election, the Court or Commission shall continue with the trial and hearing of the action, inquiry or protest and, upon motion of the complainant or any intervenor, may during the pendency thereof order the suspension of the proclamation of such candidate whenever the evidence of guilt is strong.</blockquote>Under the above-quoted provision, not only is a disqualification case against a candidate allowed to continue after the election (and does not oust the COMELEC of its jurisdiction), but his obtaining the highest number of votes will not result in the suspension or termination of the proceedings against him when the evidence of guilt is strong. <b>While the phrase "when the evidence of guilt is strong" seems to suggest that the provisions of Section 6 ought to be applicable only to disqualification cases under Section 68 of the Omnibus Election Code, SECTION 7 OF R.A. 6646 ALLOWS THE APPLICATION OF THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 6 TO CASES INVOLVING DISQUALIFICATION BASED ON INELIGIBILITY UNDER SECTION 78 OF B.P. 881</b>. Section 7 states:<br><blockquote>Sec. 7. <i>Petition to Deny Due Course or to Cancel a Certificate of Candidacy</i>. — The procedure hereinabove provided shall apply to petition to deny due course to or cancel a certificate of candidacy based on Sec. 78 of<i> Batas Pambansa</i> 881.6 (Emphases supplied.)</blockquote></blockquote><br>Accordingly, I do not agree with the overly broad statement in the majority opinion and the concurring opinion of Justice Brion that the cancellation of the certificate of candidacy whether before or alter the election is immaterial in determining the validity of the votes cast. The said statement or opinion, which in effect declines to abide with the mandate in Section 7 to apply Section 6 to a petition to deny due course to or cancel a certificate of candidacy, is based on the technical argument that when a person's certificate of candidacy is denied due course or cancelled, he is not to be considered a candidate. This technical ground may be properly applied in certain cases as where substitution is not allowed, such as when the cancellation takes place before election. However, it may not suffice to justify the nullification of the votes already cast before the certificate of candidacy is cancelled by final judgment. Whether it is disqualification or ineligibility, if votes were cast before final adjudication of disqualification or ineligibility, there appears to be no justifiable reason to consider as stray the votes cast by the voters if in their honest belief they voted for a qualified or eligible candidate. The said voters should not be disenfranchised because of the unresolved petition for cancellation of a certificate of candidacy unless the ground for disqualification or ineligibility is of such notoriety that the voters can be considered to have deliberately squandered their votes for a disqualified or ineligible candidate. The nullification of the votes of those voters who were unaware of the disqualification or ineligibility of the person they voted for because of the unresolved petition for cancellation of the certificate of candidacy, which effectively disenfranchises them, cannot be justified on the excuse that the votes cast for the next ranking candidate are anyway to be considered as an expression of the sovereign will. It is for this reason that I do not agree to the resulting automatic disenfranchisement of the voters if the certificate of candidacy is cancelled after the election. Such consequence emanates from the undue interpretation that Section 7 should not be construed to allow the application of Section 6 to the petition for cancellation or denial of the certificate of candidacy, which interpretation is grounded principally on the theory that no certificate of candidacy means that there is no existing candidate. This will give precedence to technicality over substance, particularly, as it impacts on the sanctity of the vote of the electorate incognizant of the disqualification or ineligibility of the one they voted for.<br><br>However, except for its implication on the interpretation of the provisions of Sections 6 and 7 of R.A. No. 6646,1 concur in the result of the <i>ponencia</i> of Justice Diosdado M. Peralta. This case may be likened to the <i>Aratea</i> case in so far as the decision of the Regional Trial Court ordering the deletion of Hayudini's name in <i>Barangay</i> Bintawlan's permanent list of voters, which rendered him ineligible to run for the position of mayor of South Ubian, was already final and executory before the election.<br><br>We can now apply the rule that a second placer is allowed to take the place of a disqualified winning candidate when two requisites concur, namely: (<i><b>i</b></i>) the candidate who obtained the highest number of votes is disqualified; and (<b><i>ii</i></b>) the electorate was fully aware in fact and in law of that candidate's disqualification as to bring such awareness within the realm of notoriety but the electorate still cast the plurality of the votes in favor of the ineligible candidate.7 And it is with the concurrence of the two requisites that the voting public may be said to have waived the validity and efficacy of their votes by notoriously misapplying their franchise or throwing away their votes, in which case the eligible candidate with the second highest number of votes may be deemed elected.8 The finality of the RTC decision which definitely determined the ineligibility of Hayudini long before the election, the votes cast in his favor are considered stray and Salma A. Omar, the second placer, is deemed the duly elected Mayor of the Municipality of South Ubian, Tawi-Tawi.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Separate Concurring Opinion, p. 12.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 595 Phil. 449, 475 (2008).<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> G.R.

The time to hold a person accountable for the grounds for disqualification is after attaining the status of a candidate, with the filing of the CoC.</b><br><br>To sum up and reiterate the essential differences between the eligibility requirements and disqualifications, the former are the requirements that apply to, and must be complied by, all citizens who wish to run for local elective office; these must be positively asserted in the CoC. The latter refer to individual traits, conditions or acts applicable to specific individuals that serve as grounds against one who has qualified as a candidate to lose this status or privilege; essentially, they have nothing to do with a candidate’s CoC.<br><br>When the law allows the <b>cancellation of a candidate’s CoC</b>, the law considers the cancellation <b>from the point of view of those positive requirements that every citizen who wishes to run for office must commonly satisfy</b>.&nbsp; Since the elements of “eligibility” are common, the vice of ineligibility attaches to and affects both the candidate <b><i>and</i></b> his CoC.&nbsp; In contrast, when the law allows the disqualification of a candidate, the law looks only at the disqualifying trait or condition specific to the individual; if the “eligibility” requirements have been satisfied, the disqualification applies only to the person of the candidate, leaving the CoC valid.&nbsp; A previous conviction of subversion is the best example as it applies not to the citizenry at large, but only to the convicted individuals; a convict may have a valid CoC upon satisfying the eligibility requirements under Section 74 of the OEC, but shall nevertheless be disqualified.<br><br>While the violation of the three-term rule is properly a ground for disqualification, it is a unique ground, constitutionally anchored at that, that sets it apart from and creates a distinction even from the ordinary grounds of disqualification. The succeeding discussions incorporate these intra-disqualification distinctions on the grounds for disqualification, which in sum refer to (i) the period to file a petition and (ii) capability of substitution and (iii) on the application of the doctrine of rejection of second placer and the doctrine’s exceptions.<br><br><i><b>Distinctions among (i) denying due course to or<br> cancellation of a CoC, (ii) disqualification, and<br> (iii) quo warranto</b></i><br><br>The nature of the eligibility requirements for a local elective office and the disqualifications that may apply to candidates necessarily create distinctions on the <u>remedies available</u>, on the <u>effects of lack of eligibility and on the application of disqualification</u>. The remedies available are essentially: the <b>cancellation of a CoC, disqualification from candidacy or from holding office</b>, and <b>quo warranto</b>, which are distinct remedies with varying applicability and effects. For ease of presentation and understanding, their availability, grounds and effects are topically discussed below.<br><br><b><i>As to the grounds:</i></b><br><br>In the <b>denial of due course to or cancellation of a CoC</b>, the ground is essentially lack of eligibility under the pertinent constitutional and statutory provisions on qualifications or eligibility for public office;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; the governing provisions are <i>Sections 78 and 69 of the OEC</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>In a <b>disqualification case</b>, as mentioned above, the grounds are traits, conditions, characteristics or acts of disqualification,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> individually applicable to a candidate, as provided under Sections 68 and 12 of B.P. Blg. 881; Section 40 of LGC 1991; and, as discussed below, Section 8, Article X of the Constitution. As previously discussed, the grounds for disqualification are different from, and have nothing to do with, a candidate’s CoC although they may result in disqualification from candidacy whose immediate effect <b>upon finality before the elections</b> is the same as a cancellation.&nbsp; If they are cited in a petition filed before the elections, they remain as disqualification grounds and carry effects that are distinctly peculiar to disqualification.<br><br>In a <i><u>quo warranto petition</u></i>, the grounds to oust an elected official from his office are ineligibility and disloyalty to the Republic of the Philippines.&nbsp; This is provided under Section 253 of the OEC and governed by the Rules of Court as to procedures.&nbsp; While <i>quo warranto</i> and cancellation share the same ineligibility grounds, <b>they differ as to the time these grounds are cited</b>.&nbsp; A cancellation case is brought before the elections, while a <i>quo warranto </i>is filed after and may still be filed even if a CoC cancellation case was not filed before elections.<br><br><blockquote>The only difference between the two proceedings is that, under section 78, the qualifications for elective office are misrepresented in the certificate of candidacy and the proceedings must be initiated before the elections, whereas a petition for <i>quo warranto</i> under section 253 may be brought on the basis of two grounds - (1) ineligibility or (2) disloyalty to the Republic of the Philippines, and must be initiated within ten days after the proclamation of the election results.&nbsp; Under section 253, a candidate is ineligible if he is disqualified to be elected to office, and he is disqualified if he lacks any of the qualifications for elective office.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></blockquote><br>Note that the question of what would constitute <u>acts of disqualification</u> – under Sections 68 and 12 of the OEC and Section 40 of LGC 1991 – is best resolved by directly referring to the provisions involved.&nbsp; On the other hand, what constitutes a violation of the three-term limit rule under the Constitution has been clarified in our case law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> The approach is not as straight forward in a petition to <u>deny due course to or cancel a CoC</u> and also to <u>a <i>quo warranto</i> petition</u>, which similarly covers the ineligibility of a candidate/elected official.

As in a <i>quo warranto</i>, any substitution is too late at this point.<br><br><b><i>As to the effects of a successful suit on<br>the right of the second placer in the elections:</i></b><br><br>In any of these three remedies, the doctrine of rejection of the second placer applies for the simple reason that –<br><br><blockquote>To simplistically assume that the second placer would have received the other votes would be to substitute our judgment for the mind of the voter.&nbsp; The second placer is just that, a second placer.&nbsp; He lost the elections.&nbsp; He was repudiated by either a majority or plurality of voters.&nbsp; He could not be considered the first among qualified candidates because in a field which excludes the disqualified candidate, the conditions would have substantially changed. We are not prepared to extrapolate the results under such circumstances.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></blockquote><br>With the disqualification of the winning candidate and the application of the doctrine of rejection of the second placer, the <b>rules on succession</b> under the law accordingly apply.<br><br>As an <b>exceptional situation,</b> however, the candidate with the second highest number of votes (<i>second placer</i>) may be validly proclaimed as the winner in the elections should the winning candidate be <b>disqualified</b> by final judgment <b><u><i>before</i> the elections</u></b>, as clearly provided in Section 6 of R.A. No. 6646.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The same effect obtains when the electorate is fully aware, in fact and in law and within the realm of notoriety, of the disqualification, yet they still voted for the disqualified candidate.&nbsp; In this situation, the electorate that cast the plurality of votes in favor of the notoriously disqualified candidate is simply deemed to have waived their right to vote.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>In a <b>CoC cancellation</b> proceeding, the law is silent on the legal effect of a judgment cancelling the CoC and does not also provide any temporal distinction.&nbsp; <b>Given, however, the formal initiatory role a CoC plays and the standing it gives to a political aspirant, the cancellation of the CoC based on a finding of its invalidity effectively results in a vote for an inexistent “candidate” or for one who is deemed not to be in the ballot. </b>Although legally a misnomer, the “second placer” should be proclaimed the winner as the candidate with the highest number of votes for the contested position.&nbsp; <b>This same consequence should result if the cancellation case becomes final after elections, as the cancellation signifies non-candidacy from the very start, <i>i.e.</i>, from before the elections</b>.<br><br><i><b>The Above Rulings and Principles as <br>Applied to the Present Case</b></i><br><br>I agree with the <i>ponencia</i> that the Comelec properly cancelled Hayudini’s CoC.&nbsp; It is apparent from the undisputed facts that Mustapha did indeed file a petition for denial and/or the cancellation of Hayudini’s CoC.&nbsp; It is also obvious, based on the above discussions, that the ground he cited was appropriate for the cancellation of Hayudini’s CoC.&nbsp; The main ground of the said petition is that Hayudini committed dishonesty in declaring that he was a registered voter of Barangay Bintawlan, South Ubian, Tawi-Tawi, when in fact he was not.&nbsp; As the Court held in <i>Munder v. Commission on Elections,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> this ground is appropriate for a petition to deny due course or to cancel CoC, thus:<br><br><blockquote>We agree with Munder as to the nature of the petition filed by Sarip.&nbsp; <b>The main ground of the said petition is that Munder committed dishonesty in declaring that he was a registered voter of Barangay Rogero, Bubong, Lanao del Sur, when in fact he was not.&nbsp; This&nbsp; ground is appropriate for a Petition to Deny Due Course or to Cancel Certificate of Candidacy.</b><br><br><i>Amora v. Comelec</i> is applicable to the present controversy.&nbsp; In that case, similar to the present one, a mayoralty candidate was disqualified by the Comelec pursuant to a Petition for Disqualification.&nbsp; The petition was filed by one of the candidates for councilor in the same municipality, on the ground that the CoC had not been properly sworn to.&nbsp; Amora won in the election, but was disqualified by the Comelec after he was proclaimed as mayor of Candijay, Bohol. One of the issues clarified in the said case was the distinction between a Petition for Disqualification and a Petition to Deny Due Course or to Cancel Certificate of Candidacy.&nbsp; The Court, in effect, held that the Comelec should have dismissed the petition outright, since it was premised on a wrong ground.&nbsp; A Petition for Disqualification has specific grounds different from those of a Petition to Deny Due Course to or to Cancel Certificate of Candidacy.&nbsp; The latter is anchored on the false representation by a candidate as to material information in the CoC.<br><br>For a petition for disqualification, the law expressly enumerates the grounds in Section 68 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 881 as amended, and which was replicated in Section 4(b) of Comelec Resolution No. 8696.&nbsp; The grounds stated by respondent in his Petition for Disqualification – that Munder was not qualified to run for not being a registered voter therein – was not included in the enumeration of the grounds for disqualification.&nbsp; The grounds in Section 68 may be categorized into two.&nbsp; First, those comprising “prohibited” acts of candidates; and second, the fact of their permanent residency in another country when that fact affects the residency requirement of a candidate according to the law.<br><br>In the earlier case of <i>Fermin v. Comelec</i>, the Court clarified the two remedies that may be availed of by a candidate to prevent another from running in an electoral race.&nbsp; The Court held:<br><br>The ground raised in the Dilangalen petition is that Fermin allegedly lacked one of the qualifications to be elected as mayor of Northern Kabuntalan,<i> i.e</i>., he had not established residence in the said locality for at least one year immediately preceding the election. Failure to meet the one-year residency requirement for the public office <i>is not a ground for the “disqualification” of a candidate</i> under Section 68. The provision only refers to the commission of prohibited acts and <i>the possession of a permanent resident status in a foreign country</i> as grounds for disqualification….<br><br>. . .<br><br>To emphasize, a petition for disqualification, on the one hand, can be premised on Section 12 or 68 of the [Omnibus Election Code], or Section 40 of the [Local Government Code]. On the other hand, a petition to deny due course to or cancel a CoC can only be grounded on a statement of a material representation in the said certificate that is false. The petitions also have different effects. While a person who is disqualified under Section 68 is merely prohibited to continue as a candidate, the person whose certificate is cancelled or denied due course under Section 78 is not treated as a candidate at all, as if he/she never filed a CoC.<br><br>In <i>Fermin</i>, the Court has debunked the interpretation that a petition for disqualification covers the absence of the substantive qualifications of a candidate (with the exception of the existence of the fact of the candidate's permanent residency abroad).&nbsp; It has, in effect, even struck down a Comelec Resolution - Resolution No. 7800, which enumerated the grounds for a petition for disqualification to include the non-registration of a candidate as voter in the locality where he or she is running as a candidate.&nbsp; In ruling as such, Resolution No. 7800 which was considered as infringement of the powers of the legislature, the Court reiterated an earlier ruling:<br><br>A COMELEC rule or resolution cannot supplant or vary the legislative enactments that distinguish the grounds for disqualification from those of ineligibility, and the appropriate proceedings to raise the said grounds. In other words, Rule 25 and COMELEC Resolution No. 7800 cannot supersede the dissimilar requirements of the law for the filing of a petition for disqualification under Section 68, and a petition for the denial of due course to or cancellation of CoC under Section 78 of the OEC.<br><br>Responding to the above ruling, the Comelec’s subsequent&nbsp; Resolution on the same matter deleted the enumerated grounds, interpreted by the Court as improper for a petition for disqualification, found in Comelec Resolution 7800.<br><br><b>It is thus clear that the ground invoked by Sarip in his Petition for Disqualification against Munder - the latter’s alleged status as unregistered voter in the municipality - was inappropriate for the said petition.&nbsp; The said ground should have been raised in a petition to cancel Munder’s CoC. [emphasis ours]</b><br></blockquote><br>As mentioned above, considering that the cited ground is appropriate for cancellation of CoC case, it logically and necessarily follows that the question of who is the duly elected Mayor of South Ubian, Tawi-Tawi should be resolved under the rules of cancellation of CoC and not from the rules of disqualification proposed by Justice De Castro.<br><br>Justice De Castro espouses the view that Section 6<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> (on the effects of disqualification) in relation to Section 7 (on a petition to deny due course to or cancel a CoC)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> of RA 6646 should be applied in this case so that the permanent vacancy in the office of mayor of South Ubian (as a result of the cancellation of Hayudini’s CoC) should be filled pursuant to the rules of succession under Section 44 of the Local Government Code.<br><br>I disagree with this position.<br><br>In <i>Fermin v.

Sections 6 and 7 reads:<br><br>Sec. 6. <i>Effect of Disqualification Case.</i> — Any candidate who has been declared by final judgment to be disqualified shall not be voted for, and the votes cast for him shall not be counted.

Filing by mail shall not be allowed.<br><br>(b) Within three (3) days from the filing of the petition, the Commission shall issue summons to the respondent candidate together with a copy of the petition and its enclosures, if any.<br><br>(c) The respondent shall be given three (3) days from receipt of the summons within which to file his verified answer (not a motion to dismiss) to the petition, serving copy thereof upon the petitioner. Grounds for a motion to dismiss may be raised as affirmative defenses.<br><br>(d) The Commission may designate any of its officials who are lawyers to hear the case and receive evidence. The proceeding shall be summary in nature. In<i> lieu</i> of oral testimonies, the parties may be required to submit position papers together with affidavits or counter-affidavits and other documentary evidence. The hearing officer shall immediately submit to the Commission his findings, reports, and recommendations within five (5) days from the completion of such submission of evidence.

Heretofore, no law provided for the procedure to govern cases under Section 78. Applying to such cases, through Section 7 of R.A. No. 6646, the procedure applicable to cases of nuisance candidates is prudent and wise, for both cases necessarily require that they be decided before the day of the election; hence, only summary proceedings thereon can adequately respond to the urgency of the matter.<br><br><b>Third, Section 6 merely supplements Section 72 of the Omnibus Election Code providing as follows:</b><br><br>Sec. 72. <i>Effects of disqualification cases and priority.</i> — The Commission and the courts shall give priority to cases of disqualification by reason of violation of this Act to the end that a final decision shall be rendered not later than seven days before the election in which the disqualification is sought.<br><br>Any candidate who has been declared by final judgment to be disqualified shall not be voted for, and the votes cast for him shall not be counted. Nevertheless, if for any reason, a candidate is not declared by final judgment before an election to be disqualified and he is voted for and receives the winning number of votes in such election, his violation of the provisions of the preceding sections shall not prevent his proclamation and assumption to office.<br><br>by granting the COMELEC or the Court the authority to continue hearing the case and to suspend the proclamation if the evidence of guilt is strong. <b><u>As observed by this Court in its majority "the phrase 'when the evidence of guilt is strong' seems to suggest that the provisions of Section 6 ought to be applicable only to disqualification cases under Section 68 of the Omnibus Election Code."</u></b> [Emphases ours]</blockquote><br><b>Based on these considerations, I find it clear that Section 6 of RA 6646 is only applicable to disqualification cases under Section 68 of the Omnibus election Code and not to cancellation of CoC cases under Section 78 of the same Code</b>.&nbsp; At the risk of repetition, Section 7 cannot be construed to refer to Section 6 (which does not provide for a procedure but for the effects of disqualification), but can only refer to the procedure provided in Section 5 of RA 6646 on nuisance candidates.&nbsp; Thus, Justice De Castro’s conclusion that “the instruction in Section 7 in relation to Section 6 of RA 6646 is that, the effect/s of a disqualification case is made to apply to petitions to deny due course to or cancel CoCs” is wrong.<br><br>To be sure, the application of the effects of disqualification under Section 6 of RA 6646 in the present case would be tenable if the petition is one for disqualification.&nbsp; However, the pertinent allegations of Mustapha’s petition clearly show that the same is actually a petition for cancellation of CoC, the effect of which is not covered by Section 6 of RA 6646, which repealed Section 72 of the Omnibus Election Code cited above.<br><br>I emphasize that unlike a judgment on a petition to cancel a CoC, the effects of a judgment on a petition for disqualification distinguish whether the same attained finality before or after elections.&nbsp; If the judgment became final before the elections, the effect is identical to that of cancellation of a CoC.&nbsp; If, however, the judgment attained finality after the elections, the candidate is still considered an official candidate and may even be proclaimed the winner should he or she garner the majority votes in the elections.&nbsp; Clearly, these crucial distinctions between the effects of cancellation of a CoC and disqualification would be for naught if we adopt Justice De Castro’s view that Section 6 of RA 6646 should be made applicable to cancellation of CoC cases.<br><br>In the present case, Hayudini, whose CoC was <b>denied due course or cancelled</b> is not considered a candidate at all; the votes in his favor are considered votes for an inexistent candidate or for one who is deemed not to be in the ballot.&nbsp; The second placer (which is legally a misnomer), Salma should be proclaimed the winner as the candidate with the highest number of votes for the mayoralty post of South Ubian, Tawi-Tawi.&nbsp; That Hayudini’s CoC cancellation case became final after the elections is of no moment since the cancellation of his CoC retroacts to the date of the filing of the CoC; it signifies non-candidacy from the very start, <i>i.e., </i>from before the elections.<br><br>In these lights, I vote to dismiss the petition.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> G.R.
