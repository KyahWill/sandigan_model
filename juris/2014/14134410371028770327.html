As to the remaining portion of the May 30, 2007 Order of Secretary Pangandaman, the same was upheld.<br><br>Respondents’ motion for reconsideration was denied under the OP’s Resolution dated September 30, 2008.<br><br>The case was elevated by respondents to the CA via a petition for review under Rule 43.&nbsp; By Decision dated January 31, 2011, the CA reversed the OP’s ruling and reinstated the Orders dated February 2, 2006 and May 30, 2007 of Secretary Pangandaman.&nbsp; According to the CA, the ambiguity in the February 28, 1995 Order of Secretary Garilao lies in its failure to specify as to which portion of the 14.617 hectares should the five hectares retention area of Delfino be taken.&nbsp; Thus, even after the said order had become final and executory, the DAR Secretary is not precluded from making the necessary amendments/clarifications thereof so that the <i>fallo</i> would at least conform with the body of said order and so that the same could readily be executed with dispatch. But since Delfino sold two hectares to SM Prime Holdings, Inc. before the ambiguity could be properly addressed by DAR, the CA found no reversible error in the February 2, 2006 Order clarifying the ambiguity and in the May 30, 2007 Order stating the rationale for such clarification.<br><br>Delfino, represented by his surviving heirs (petitioners) filed a motion for reconsideration but the CA denied it under Resolution dated June 17, 2011.<br><br><center><b><u>Issues</u></b><br></center><br>The issues to be resolved in the present controversy are: (1) whether the February 2, 2006 Order of Secretary Pangandaman, insofar as it clarified the February 28, 1995 Order of Secretary Garilao, violated the rule on immutability of final judgments; and (2) whether the inclusion of the two-hectare portion sold to SM Prime Holdings, Inc. in Delfino’s retention area was in derogation of Section 6 of Republic Act No. 6657 (RA 6657).<br><br><center><b><u>Our Ruling</u></b></center><br>We grant in part the petition.<br><br>The right of retention is a constitutionally guaranteed right, which is subject to qualification by the legislature.

Three (3) hectares may be awarded to each child of the landowner, subject to the following qualifications: (1) that he is at least fifteen (15) years of age; and (2) that he is actually tilling the land or directly managing the farm:<i> Provided</i>, That landowners whose land have been covered by Presidential Decree No. 27 shall be allowed to keep the area originally retained by them thereunder;<i> Provided, further,</i> That original homestead grantees or their direct compulsory heirs who still own the original homestead at the time of the approval of this Act shall retain the same areas as long as they continue to cultivate said homestead.<br><br><b>The right to choose the area to be retained, which shall be compact or contiguous, shall pertain to the landowner;</b> <i>Provided, however</i>, That in case the area selected for retention by the landowner is tenanted, the tenant shall have the option to choose whether to remain therein or be a beneficiary in the same or another agricultural land with similar or comparable features. In case the tenant chooses to remain in the retained area, he shall be considered a leaseholder and shall lose his right to be a beneficiary under this Act. In case the tenant chooses to be a beneficiary in another agricultural land, he loses his right as a leaseholder to the land retained by the landowner. The tenant must exercise this option within a period of one (1) year from the time the landowner manifests his choice of the area for retention.<br><br>In all cases, the security of tenure of the farmers or farmworkers on the land prior to the approval of this Act shall be respected.<br><br>Upon the effectivity of this Act, any sale, disposition, lease, management contract or transfer of possession of private lands executed by the original landowner in violation of this Act shall be null and void; <i>Provided, however,</i> That those executed prior to this Act shall be valid only when registered with the Register of Deeds within a period of three (3) months after the effectivity of this Act. Thereafter, all Registers of Deeds shall inform the DAR within thirty (30) days of any transaction involving agricultural lands in excess of five (5) hectares.&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>Under the February 28, 1995 Order of Secretary Garilao, Delfino was granted five hectares “from the tenanted portion as his retained area.”&nbsp; Said order had become final and executory on March 9, 1997.<br><br>A decision that has acquired finality becomes immutable and unalterable, and may no longer be modified in any respect, even if the modification is meant to correct erroneous conclusions of fact or law, and whether it will be made by the court that rendered it or by the highest court of the land.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; This doctrine of finality and immutability of judgments is grounded on fundamental considerations of public policy and sound practice to the effect that, at the risk of occasional error, the judgments of the courts must become final at some definite date set by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>There are, however, exceptions to the general rule, namely: (1) the correction of clerical errors; (2) the so-called <i>nunc pro tunc </i>entries which cause no prejudice to any party; (3) void judgments; and (4) whenever circumstances transpire after the finality of the decision rendering its execution unjust and inequitable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> The exception to the doctrine of immutability of judgment has been applied in several cases in order to serve substantial justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>In this case, the clarification made by Secretary Pangandaman in his February 2, 2006 Order falls under the fourth exception.<br><br>It is true that the February 28, 1995 Order of Secretary Garilao stated that the five hectares shall be taken from the <i>tenanted area</i>, which pertains to the<b> 9.8597</b> hectares of which <b>6.5671 hectares</b> were already issued with EPs in favor of respondents.&nbsp; Subsequently, however, without prior clearance from the DAR, Delfino sold two hectares of land covered by OLT to SM Prime Holdings, Inc.&nbsp; The DAR Secretary thus found it fair and equitable to include the said portion to Delfino’s retention area, which meant that Delfino is entitled only to the balance of three hectares.<br><br>As explained by Secretary Pangandaman in his order denying Delfino’s motion for reconsideration, this clarification was made in order not to circumvent the five-hectare limitation as said landowner “cannot [be allowed to] simultaneously enjoy … the proceeds of the [sale] and at the same time exercise the right of retention”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; to the maximum of five hectares.<br><br>Petitioners argue that the amendment/clarification of the February 28, 1995 Order resulted in the diminution of Delfino’s right of retention under Section 6 of RA 6657 because the DAR Secretary cannot impose on the landowner the area of retention, the choice of the landowner having been upheld in numerous cases decided by this Court particularly in<i> Daez v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>.&nbsp; It is further contended that the two hectares sold to SM by Delfino cannot be considered as retention area, the same having been declared not agricultural land, pursuant to the Exemption Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> dated September 14, 2005 issued by Regional Director Homer P. Tobias.<br><br>On the matter of allowing Delfino to choose the remaining three hectares of his retention area, we rule for the petitioners.<br><br>While we agree with Secretary Pangandaman in holding that Delfino had partially exercised his right of retention when he sold two hectares to SM Prime Holdings, Inc.,<i> after</i> his application for retention was granted by Secretary Garilao, we cannot affirm the portion of the February 2, 2006 Order which decreed that the remaining three hectares shall be taken “either from the 4.8120 hectares covered by TCT Nos. T-21711 (T-49744) and T-216233.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; Such directive encroaches on the prerogative expressly given to landowners under Section 6 of RA 6657 to choose their area of retention.<br><br>As this Court held in <i>Daez v. Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> the right of retention can be exercised over tenanted land and even where CLOAs or EPs have been issued to tenant-farmers provided that the right of tenants under Section 6 of RA 6657 is similarly protected.&nbsp; Thus:<br><br><blockquote><b>…For as long as the area to be retained is compact or contiguous and it does not exceed the retention ceiling of five (5) hectares, a landowner’s choice of the area to be retained, must prevail. </b>Moreover, Administrative Order No. 4, series of 1991, which supplies the details for the exercise of a landowner’s retention rights, likewise recognizes no limit to the prerogative of the landowner, although he is persuaded to retain other lands instead to avoid dislocation of farmers.<br><br><b>Without doubt, this right of retention may be exercised over tenanted land despite even the issuance of Certificate of Land Transfer (CLT) to farmer-beneficiaries. <i>What must be protected, however, is the right of the tenants to opt to either stay on the land chosen to be retained by the landowner or be a beneficiary in another agricultural land with similar or comparable features.</i></b><br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>The issuance of EPs or CLOAs to beneficiaries does not absolutely bar the landowner from retaining the area covered thereby. Under Administrative Order No. 2, series of 1994, an EP or CLOA may be cancelled if the land covered is later found to be part of the landowner’s retained area.<br></b><br>A certificate of title accumulates in one document a comprehensive statement of the status of the fee held by the owner of a parcel of land. As such, it is a mere evidence of ownership and it does not constitute the title to the land itself. It cannot confer title where no title has been acquired by any of the means provided by law.<br><br>Thus, we had, in the past, sustained the nullification of a certificate of title issued pursuant to a homestead patent because the land covered was not part of the public domain and as a result, the government had no authority to issue such patent in the first place. Fraud in the issuance of the patent, is also a ground for impugning the validity of a certificate of title. In other words, the invalidity of the patent or title is sufficient basis for nullifying the certificate of title since the latter is merely an evidence of the former.<br><br>In the instant case, the CLTs of private respondents over the subject 4.1685-hectare riceland were issued without Eudosia Daez having been accorded her right of choice as to what to retain among her landholdings. The transfer certificates of title thus issued on the basis of those CLTs cannot operate to defeat the right of the heirs of deceased Eudosia Daez to retain the said 4.1685 hectares of riceland.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> (Underscoring in the original; emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>As to the Exemption Order allegedly issued by the DAR Regional Director dated September 14, 2005, the Court notes that the matter of SM Prime Holdings, Inc.’s application for exemption from CARP coverage was never raised by petitioners during the proceedings before the Regional Director and OP.&nbsp; Records showed that the administrative declaration of “non-agricultural” use of the two-hectare portion sold to SM Prime Holdings, Inc. pursuant to a 1981 zoning classification ordinance, was mentioned by petitioners for the first time in their Motion for Reconsideration dated February 17, 2011 after the CA rendered its adverse ruling, attaching a photocopy thereof to the motion.&nbsp; The only grounds or arguments invoked by petitioners in their Memorandum submitted to the CA were the finality of the assailed DAR Secretary’s Orders dated February 28, 1995, December 13, 1995 and August 8, 1997 and that respondents’ petition for review was filed out of time.<br><br>The general rule is that issues raised for the first time on appeal and not raised in the proceedings in the lower court are barred by estoppel.&nbsp; Points of law, theories, issues, and arguments not brought to the attention of the trial court ought not to be considered by a reviewing court, as these cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.&nbsp; To consider the alleged facts and arguments raised belatedly would amount to trampling on the basic principles of fair play, justice, and due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Finally, we find no merit in respondents’ argument that the present petition should be dismissed for failure of the other co-heirs/co-petitioners to sign the verification and certification against forum-shopping as required by Sections 4 and 5, Rule 7 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.<br><br>In the case of <i>Iglesia Ni Cristo v. Judge Ponferrada</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> we expounded on the purpose and sufficiency of compliance with the verification and certification against forum shopping requirements, <i>viz:</i><br><br><blockquote>The issue in the present case is not the lack of verification but the sufficiency of one executed by only one of plaintiffs.&nbsp; This Court held in <i>Ateneo de Naga University v. Manalo,</i> that <b>the verification requirement is deemed substantially complied with when, as in the present case, only one of the heirs-plaintiffs, who has sufficient knowledge and belief to swear to the truth of the allegations in the petition (complaint), signed the verification attached to it</b>. Such verification is deemed sufficient assurance that the matters alleged in the petition have been made in good faith or are true and correct, not merely speculative.<br><br><b>The same liberality should likewise be applied to the certification against forum shopping</b>.&nbsp; The general rule is that the certification must be signed by all plaintiffs in a case and the signature of only one of them is insufficient.&nbsp; However, the Court has also stressed in a number of cases that the rules on forum shopping were designed to promote and facilitate the orderly administration of justice and thus should not be interpreted with such absolute literalness as to subvert its own ultimate and legitimate objective.&nbsp; <b>The rule of substantial compliance may be availed of with respect to the contents of the certification.</b>&nbsp; This is because the requirement of strict compliance with the provisions merely underscores its mandatory nature in that the certification cannot be altogether dispensed with or its requirements completely disregarded.<br><br>The substantial compliance rule has been applied by this Court in a number of cases: <i>Cavile v. Heirs of Cavile, </i>where the Court sustained the validity of the certification signed by only one of petitioners because he is a relative of the other petitioners and co-owner of the properties in dispute; <i>Heirs of Agapito T. Olarte v. Office of the President of the Philippines,</i> where the Court allowed a certification signed by only two petitioners because the case involved a family home in which all the petitioners shared a common interest; <i>Gudoy v. Guadalquiver</i>, where the Court considered as valid the certification signed by only four of the nine petitioners because all petitioners filed as co-owners pro indiviso a complaint against respondents for quieting of title and damages, as such, they all have joint interest in the undivided whole; and <i>Dar v. Alonzo-Legasto, </i>where the Court sustained the certification signed by only one of the spouses as they were sued jointly involving a property in which they had a common interest.<br><br>It is noteworthy <b>that in all of the above cases, the Court applied the rule on substantial compliance because of the commonality of interest of all the parties with respect to the subject of the controversy</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is <b>PARTLY GRANTED.</b>&nbsp; The Decision dated January 31, 2011 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 111147 is <b>AFFIRMED</b> insofar as it upheld the February 2, 2006 Order of Secretary Pangandaman declaring the two-hectare land covered by TCT No. T-26378 (T-69592) which was sold by Renato L.
