				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">A petition for relief from judgment under Rule 38 is an equitable remedy which allows courts to review a judgment tainted with neglect bordering on extrinsic fraud. In this case, total damages in the amount of P11 million was awarded in spite of the evidence on record. The motion for reconsideration of such judgment filed by the legal officer of the City of Dagupan inexplicably omitted the required notice for hearing. Considering the damage that would be suffered by the local government, such mistake was so glaring as to raise suspicion that it was contrived to favor the plaintiff.<br><br>We are asked in this petition<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> filed by the City of Dagupan through its then mayor, Benjamin S. Lim, to: (1) reverse the Court of Appeals’ decision and resolution and (2) declare that the damages awarded to respondent Ester F. Maramba are excessive. Petitioner, thus, prays that this court affirm the trial court’s August 25, 2005 and November 30, 2005 rulings <i>in toto.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Respondent Ester F.

Maramba filed an opposition on the ground that the motion was not set for hearing. The opposition prayed that the motion be stricken off the records.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On October 21, 2004, the trial court denied petitioner city’s motion for lack of notice of time and place of hearing, thus, “the motion for reconsideration is not entitled to judicial cognizance.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> In a separate order on the same date, the trial court also granted Maramba’s motion for execution and ordered that “a writ of execution [be] issue[d] in the above-entitled case upon submission of the certificate of finality.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Petitioner city then filed a petition for relief with prayer for preliminary injunction dated October 29, 2004, together with an affidavit of merit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The city alleged that “the decision, were it not for the City Legal Officer’s mistake, negligence and gross incompetence, would not have been obtained by the plaintiff, or should have been reconsidered or otherwise overturned, the damage award in the total amount of P11M being not only unconscionable and unreasonable, but completely baseless.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>On November 18, 2004, the trial court denied petitioner city’s petition for relief and ordered that the writ of execution dated October 26, 2004 be implemented.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> The court stressed that “[t]he negligence of counsel binds the client.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Petitioner city filed for reconsideration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>On August 25, 2005, the trial court, through acting Judge Silverio Q. Castillo, granted the petition for relief and consequently modified its July 30, 2004 decision. It reduced the award of actual damages from P10 million to P75,000.00:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in the highest interest of justice and equity, the petition for relief from judgment is hereby granted. Consequently, the Decision is accordingly modified.<br><br>The amount of actual damages is hereby reduced from Ten Million Pesos to P75,000.00.<br><br>“<i>(O)ne is entitled to an adequate compensation for such pecuniary loss suffered by him as duly proved.</i> (Article 2199, Civil Code)<br><br>In this case, the plaintiff Ester Maramba was only able to prove the amount of P75,000.00 as the appraised value of the improvements made on the leased premises.<br><br>She was not able to show proof of the P5 million amount of improvements made on the establishment, as she was claiming to have been made.<br><br>Too, she did not show any single receipt for her travelling expenses and for the car rental she made during her stay in the country for the purpose of prosecuting this case.<br><br>“<i>It is necessary for a party seeking the award of actual damages to produce competent proof or the best evidence obtainable to justify such award.”</i> (People v. Caraig, 400 SCRA 67).<br><br>The Supreme Court has held in a lot of cases that “documentary evidence should be presented to substantiate a claim for damages”<br><br>Anent the moral damages, the same is hereby reduced from P500,000.00 to P20,000.00.<br><br>“<i>Moral damages are not punitive in nature and were never intended to enrich the claimant at the expense of the defendant.</i>” (Samson, Jr. v. Bank of the Philippine Islands, 405 SCRA 607).<br><br>The award of attorney’s fees is likewise reduced from P500,000.00 to P20,000.00.<br><br>“<i>The amount of damages awarded should not be palpably and scandalously excessive as to indicate that it was the result of prejudice or corruption on the part of the trial court</i>. (Cathay Pacific Airways, Ltd. v. Vasquez, 399 SCRA 207).<br><br>Consequently, the Writ of Execution is hereby recalled.<br><br>Notify parties and their counsel.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Aggrieved by this order and the subsequent denial of her motion for reconsideration, Maramba filed a petition for certiorari before the Court of Appeals. She argued that Judge Castillo “acted without jurisdiction as he ha[d] no authority or legal power to substantially amend or correct a final and executory judgment. . . .”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Moreover, Judge Castillo gravely abused his discretion “in granting the petition for relief filed by the other respondent city of Dagupan on the 83rd day from receipt of the judgment or 26 days late.” <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>On June 15, 2006, the Court of Appeals<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> granted Maramba’s petition for certiorari. It held that petitioner city’s motion for reconsideration lacked a notice of hearing and was a mere scrap of paper<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> that did not toll the period to appeal. Consequently, the July 30, 2004 decision penned by Judge Laron became final and executory. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> The Court of Appeals also denied reconsideration,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> prompting petitioner city to elevate the case before this court.<br><br>Petitioner city emphasizes that its motion for reconsideration of the July 30, 2004 decision was timely filed, tolling the prescriptive period to appeal. Since this decision was not yet final, its subsequent modification by the trial court was proper.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> The lack of notice of hearing in the motion for reconsideration was due to counsel’s oversight, and a denial of the motion on this ground alone sacrificed substantial rights for mere technicalities.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Petitioner city also cites jurisprudence on the suspension of procedural rules when its strict application would only result in grave injustice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Petitioner city agrees that “judgments must be final at some definite date,” but Rule 38 also provides for relief from judgments, orders, and other proceedings. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> It submits that it raised substantial issues in its motion for reconsideration such as the excessive damages awarded by the lower court in its July 30, 2004 decision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> The petition for relief was correctly granted as “counsel’s mistake amounted to extrinsic fraud”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> and “to give the plaintiff much more than it was able to prove and allow the faulty decision to be implemented is, truly, a deprivation of defendant of its property without due process.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Petitioner city contends that the modification of the July 30, 2004 decision was well established in that only duly proven pecuniary loss may be awarded.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Maramba was only able to prove P75,000.00 as the appraised value of the improvements made on the property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> According to petitioner city, “the proper amount of damages then should not be Five Million Pesos (P5,000,000.00) as alleged in the complaint, nor Ten Million Pesos (P10,000,000.00) as requested in the prayer of the complaint but only Seventy-five Thousand Pesos (P75,000.00) as embodied in the contract upon which Mrs. Maramba based her claim, the Miscellaneous Lease Agreement.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> In fact, the commercial fish center made of mere G.I. sheets and light metal bars was constructed around 1998, and its value would have depreciated over time.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Lastly, petitioner city argues that its petition for relief was filed on time. On August 11, 2004, it received a copy of the July 30, 2004 decision penned by Judge Laron. On August 26, 2004, petitioner filed its motion for reconsideration. On October 25, 2004, it received a copy of the October 21, 2004 trial court order denying its motion for reconsideration. Four days later or on October 29, 2004, it filed its petition for relief from judgment.<br><br>On the other hand, Maramba maintains that petitioner city is bound by the mistake of its counsel in failing to include a notice of hearing in its motion for reconsideration. This is not excusable negligence that warrants relaxation of the rules.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Maramba submits that the Court of Appeals correctly sustained the award of damages in the July 30, 2004 trial court decision. Since a special civil action for certiorari was brought before the Court of Appeals, it correctly refrained from resolving factual questions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Petitioner city then elevated this case on Rule 45, thus, only questions of law may be raised.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Maramba adds that petitioner city “failed to nail down in the cross-examination, during the trial of private respondent (plaintiff) and her witness (Johnny Ferrer) on the witness stand after their direct testimony on the damages sustained.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>The July 30, 2004 decision was final and executory and cannot be amended even if the court later discovers that its decision was erroneous.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>In any case, instead of merely amending the July 30, 2004 decision, acting judge should have proceeded as if a motion for new trial had been granted.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> This way, “evidence of the damages claimed would have to be taken anew and offered by both parties, and such evidence on the issue of damages would then be complete before the appellate court. . . .” <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Lastly, Maramba argues that she was equally deprived of due process when acting judge of the trial court granted petitioner city’s petition for relief without conducting a hearing.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>The following issues are for resolution:<br><br><blockquote>I. Whether the lack of notice of hearing in a motion for reconsideration is excusable negligence that allows the filing of a petition for relief of judgment;<br><br>II. Whether the 60-day period to file a petition for relief from judgment, when reckoned from receipt of the denial of the motion for reconsideration, is considered filed on time;<br><br>III. Whether the Court of Appeals erred in ruling that courts have no legal power to amend or correct a final judgment even if it later finds that its decision is erroneous; and<br><br>IV.&nbsp; Whether actual damages must be substantiated in order to be awarded.</blockquote><br>Petitioner city does not deny that its motion for reconsideration lacked a notice of hearing. It offered no explanation for this lapse, except for oversight by its then counsel.<br><br>Petitioner city submits that this is excusable negligence by counsel, warranting its filing of a petition for relief from judgment under Rule 38 of the Rules of Court. Thus, the Court of Appeals erred in finding grave abuse of discretion by the trial court in granting the city’s petition.<br><br>Maramba counters that the lack of notice of hearing is not excusable negligence that warrants relaxation of the rules.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Maramba also cites<i> Dorotheo v. Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> <i>International School, Inc. v.

Thus, there is no final and executory decision yet.<br><br>In any case, notwithstanding the doctrine of immutability of judgments, this court has set aside procedural rules in “[t]he broader interests of justice and equity.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br><b>Lack of notice in the<br>motion for reconsideration</b><br><br>Maramba cites <i>Land Bank v. Natividad.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> In this case, the trial court ordered the Department of Agriculture (DA) and Land Bank to pay just compensation for the lands owned by private respondents. DA and Land Bank filed separate motions for reconsideration, but these were denied for lack of notice of hearing.<br><br>Land Bank filed a petition for relief from order on the ground of excusable negligence by its counsel who “simply scanned and signed the Motion for Reconsideration for Agrarian Case No. 2005, Regional Trial Court of Pampanga, Branch 48, not knowing, or unmindful that it had no notice of hearing”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> because of his heavy workload. This was denied, prompting Land Bank to elevate the case to this court.<br><br>This court denied Land Bank’s petition as the reasons given by counsel for his failure to include a notice of hearing in the motion for reconsideration were not considered excusable negligence.<br><br>Nevertheless, this court resolved the other issues Land Bank raised in its petition such as the question of just compensation and private respondents’ alleged failure to exhaust administrative remedies.<br><br>But in <i>Jehan Shipping Corporation v. National Food Authority,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> this court affirmed the Court of Appeals and focused on whether the purpose of a notice of hearing in a motion for reconsideration was met.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>In <i>Jehan</i>, the trial court ordered respondent National Food Authority (NFA) to pay Jehan the amounts it claimed as freight services and other expenses. The NFA received a copy of the decision on October 1, 2001, while Jehan filed a motion for execution pending appeal on October 2, 2001. The NFA later filed a motion for reconsideration on October 16, 2001 and a supplemental motion for reconsideration on November 12, 2001. Jehan filed separate oppositions to both motions. A hearing was set for the motions filed, but the NFA’s counsel failed to appear. On January 8, 2002, the trial court denied NFA’s motions for lack of notice of hearing.<br><br>The Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the NFA. It held that even if the NFA’s motion lacked a notice of hearing, Jehan’s counsel was still able to refute the substantial issues raised in the motions in its oppositions to the motions. This court affirmed this ruling and discussed the purpose behind the notice of hearing requirement as follows:<br><br><blockquote>This Court has indeed held time and time again that, under Sections 4 and 5 of Rule 15 of the Rules of Court, mandatory is the notice requirement in a motion, which is rendered defective by failure to comply with the requirement. As a rule, a motion without a notice of hearing is considered <i>pro forma</i> and does not affect the reglementary period for the appeal or the filing of the requisite pleading.<br><br>As an integral component of procedural due process, the three-day notice required by the Rules is not intended for the benefit of the movant. Rather, the requirement is for the purpose of avoiding surprises that may be sprung upon the adverse party, who must be given time to study and meet the arguments in the motion before a resolution by the court. Principles of natural justice demand that the right of a party should not be affected without giving it an opportunity to be heard.<br><br><i><b>The test is the presence of the opportunity to be heard, as well as to have time to study the motion and meaningfully oppose or controvert the grounds upon which it is based</b></i>. Considering the circumstances of the present case, we believe that the requirements of procedural due process were substantially complied with, and that the compliance justified a departure from a literal application of the rule on notice of hearing.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</blockquote><br>This court held that “when the adverse party has actually had the opportunity to be heard, and has indeed been heard through pleadings filed in opposition to the motion, the purpose behind the rule is deemed duly served.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>Jehan was quoted with approval in<i> Preysler, Jr. v. Manila Southcoast Development Corporation</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> In <i>Preysler</i>, this court ruled that “a liberal construction of the procedural rules is proper where the lapse in the literal observance of a rule of procedure has not prejudiced the adverse party and has not deprived the court of its authority.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br><b><i>Maramba was able to file an opposition to petitioner city’s motion for reconsideration on the ground that the motion was not set for hearing. The opposition prayed that the motion be stricken off the records.</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>In its one-page opposition, Maramba did not address the substantive issues raised by petitioner city in its motion for reconsideration such as the excessive award of actual damages.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> Nevertheless, this opposition was an <i>opportunity </i>to be heard for Maramba on the matters raised by petitioner city in its motion for reconsideration.<br><br>This court has relaxed procedural rules when a rigid application of these rules only hinders substantial justice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>In<i> Sy v. Local Government of Quezon City,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> Sy’s counsel filed the motion for reconsideration one day late. He explained that “his secretary’s inadvertent placing of the date January 27, 2012, instead of January 26, 2012, on the Notice of Decision constitutes excusable negligence which should therefore, justify a relaxation of the rules.” <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>This court relaxed procedural rules to give way to substantial justice:<br><br><blockquote>Be that as it may, procedural rules may, nonetheless, be relaxed for the most persuasive of reasons in order to relieve a litigant of an injustice not commensurate with the degree of his thoughtlessness in not complying with the procedure prescribed. Corollarily, the rule, which states that the mistakes of counsel bind the client, may not be strictly followed where observance of it would result in the outright deprivation of the client’s liberty or property, or where the interest of justice so requires.<br><br>As applied in this case, the Court finds that the procedural consequence of the above-discussed one-day delay in the filing of the subject motion – which, as a matter of course, should render the CA’s January 20, 2012 Decision already final and executory and hence, bar the instant petition – is incommensurate to the injustice which Sy may suffer. This is in line with the Court’s observation that the amount of just compensation, the rate of legal interest, as well as the time of its accrual, were incorrectly adjudged by both the RTC and the CA, contrary to existing jurisprudence. In this respect, the Court deems it proper to relax the rules of procedure and thus, proceed to resolve these substantive issues.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> (Citations omitted.)</blockquote><br>In <i>United Airlines v. Uy,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> the notice of appeal was filed two days late, and no reason was given by respondent’s counsel for the delay. This court still gave due course to the appeal “due to the unique and peculiar facts of the case and the serious question of law it poses.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> It discussed that “technicality, when it deserts its proper office as an aid to justice and becomes its great hindrance and chief enemy, deserves scant consideration.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>In <i>Samala v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> the notice of appeal was filed one day late because the one entrusted to file it suffered from stomach pains. This court considered this as excusable negligence:<br><br><blockquote>We said that the general aim of procedural law is to facilitate the application of justice to the rival claims of contending parties, bearing in mind that procedural rules are created not to hinder or delay but to facilitate and promote the administration of justice. In rendering decisions, courts must not be too dogmatic. A complete view must be taken in order to render a just and equitable judgment. It is far better to dispose of a case on the merits, which is a primordial end, than on technicality that may result in injustice.<br><br>The rules of procedure are mere tools designed to facilitate the attainment of justice. Their strict and rigid application especially on technical matters, which tends to frustrate rather than promote substantial justice, must be avoided. Even the Revised Rules of Court envision this liberality. Technicality, when it deserts its proper office as an aid to justice and becomes its great hindrance and chief enemy, deserves scant consideration from the courts. (Citations omitted.)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup></blockquote><br>In this case, petitioner city received a copy of the trial court’s July 30, 2004 decision on August 11, 2004.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> Its motion for reconsideration filed on August 26, 2004 was filed within the 15-day period. The purposes behind the required notice of hearing — provide the time to study the motion for reconsideration and give an opportunity to be heard — were satisfied when Maramba filed an opposition to the motion.<br><br><b>Mistake bordering<br>on extrinsic fraud</b><br><br>Rule 38 of the Rules of Court allows for the remedy called a petition for relief from judgment. This is an equitable remedy “allowed in exceptional cases when there is no other available or adequate remedy”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> that will allow for substantive justice.<br><br>Section 1 of Rule 38 provides for the grounds that warrant the filing of a petition under Rule 38:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 1.
