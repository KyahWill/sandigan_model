Psy.” under “Degrees/Units Earned.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Respondent claimed that the PDS copy on file with OAS was not his, which accounted for the discrepancies.&nbsp; An examination, however, of both the handwritten and typewritten PDS dated January 6, 1997 shows that most of the details listed were the same.&nbsp; The signatures on both copies were also similar.&nbsp; Even if we were to disregard the typewritten PDS dated January 6, 1997, his other PDS dated May 6, 1991, January 6, 1997, and October 15, 2001 show that he listed “B.S. Psychology” as his college degree.<br><br>His argument that he interpreted degrees earned and units earned to mean the same has no merit.&nbsp; It only takes a simple comprehension of the English language to understand that “<i>degree earned</i>” means the degree which the applicant graduated with.&nbsp; “<i>Units earned</i>” would mean the number of units finished in a specific degree course if the applicant has not yet earned the degree.<br><br>Respondent has shown that he understood exactly what the two terms meant. On his PDS dated October 15, 2001, he wrote “B.S. Psychology” under “Degree Earned,” even if the form specified that the applicant “write NONE if not graduated.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; In the personal data sheets he submitted to the OCA-SPB, he specified “B.S. Psychology” under “Degree Course” and “101 Units” under “Highest Grade/Level/Units Earned,” while keeping the “Year Graduated” blank.&nbsp; He made another entry for New Era University where he wrote down “BSBA Banking &amp; Finance” for “Degree Course,” “Graduate” for “Highest Grade/Level/Units Earned,” and “2010” for “Year Graduated.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Respondent’s intent to deceive is clear from the information he falsified. Civil Service Resolution No. 97-0404 dated January 24, 1997 required a bachelor’s degree and Career Service (Professional) Second Level Eligibility for the position of Cashier I.<br><br>At the time he was appointed Cashier I on April 8, 1997, he only possessed the required civil service eligibility, as shown by his civil service certificate<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> dated May 13, 1988.&nbsp; He did not have a bachelor’s degree, since he had only completed 101 units in Far Eastern University.&nbsp; Without this bachelor’s degree, he would not be qualified for the position he was appointed to.&nbsp; Despite this, respondent made it appear on his PDS dated May 6, 1991<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> and January 6, 1997<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> that he had a bachelor’s degree in psychology from Far Eastern University.<br><br>His deception would have gone unnoticed had he not attempted to apply for a promotion.&nbsp; It was as if he knew that once he attained his bachelor’s degree in 2010, he was qualified not only for the positions he was applying for but also the position he was occupying.&nbsp; His subsequent attainment of a college degree, however, does not mitigate his liability.&nbsp; It does not remedy the fact that he knowingly falsified pertinent information in his PDS so he can be appointed to a position he was not qualified for.<br><br>In <i>Villordon v. Avila,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> this court stated that:<br><br><blockquote>Civil service rules mandate the accomplishment of the PDS as a requirement for employment in the government. Hence, making false statements in one’s PDS is ultimately connected with one’s employment in the government. The employee making false statements in his or her PDS becomes liable for falsification.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>The declarations that every government personnel makes in accomplishing and signing the PDS are not empty statements. Duly accomplished forms of the Civil Service Commission are considered official documents, which, by their very nature are in the same category as public documents, and become admissible in evidence without need of further proof. As an official document made in the course of official duty, its contents are prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The false statements in his PDS prejudiced other more qualified applicants, who would have been hired for that position had it not been for his misrepresentations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; He is, therefore, liable not only for dishonesty but also for falsification of public documents.<br><br>In <i>Re: Administrative Case for Dishonesty and Falsification of Official Document: Benjamin R. Katly</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br><blockquote>We have repeatedly said that persons involved in the dispensation of justice, from the highest official to the lowest clerk, must live up to the strictest standards of integrity, probity, uprightness, honesty and diligence in the public service. This Court will not tolerate dishonesty for the Judiciary expects the best from all its employees. An employee, such as respondent, who falsifies an official document to gain unwarranted advantage over other more qualified applicants to the same position and secure the sought-after promotion cannot be said to have measured up to the standards required of a public servant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></blockquote><br>“Dishonesty and falsification are malevolent acts that have no place in the judiciary.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; Under Rule 10, Section 46 (A) (1) (6) of the Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, these offenses are punishable by dismissal.&nbsp; The penalty of dismissal from service includes cancellation of eligibility, forfeiture of leave credits, and retirement benefits, and disqualification from re-employment in the government service.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>As correctly pointed out by the OCA, a distinction must be made with respect to his credits accrued before April 8, 1997 and his leave credits accrued after April 8, 1997.<br><br>Before he was appointed Cashier I on April 8, 1997, he had been previously working as a Cash Clerk II, a position which only required Civil Service (Subprofessional) First Level Eligibility and completion of two years’ studies in college.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp; Since he was qualified for the position of Cash Clerk II, he should be allowed to keep the leave credits accrued before his appointment to Casher I.<br><br>However, in accordance with this court’s ruling in <i>Re: Administrative Case for Dishonesty and Falsification of Official Document: Benjamin R.
