The RTC, in an Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> dated May 13, 1993, denied the said motion; hence, the GSIS filed its answer<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> with counterclaims for litigation expenses, attorney’s fees, and exemplary damages. Subsequently, the GSIS filed a Third Party Complaint<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> for indemnification against Pool, the reinsurer.<br><br><center><b>The RTC Ruling</b></center><br>In a Judgment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> dated February 3, 1999, the RTC granted petitioner’s indemnity claims. It held that: (<i>a</i>) the average clause provision in the policies which did not contain the assent or signature of the petitioner cannot limit the GSIS’ liability, for being inefficacious and contrary to public policy;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> (<i>b</i>) petitioner has established that the damages it sustained were due to the peril insured against;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> and (<i>c</i>) CAR Policy No. 88/086 was deemed renewed when the GSIS withheld the amount of P35,855.00 corresponding to the premium payable,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> from the retentions it released to petitioner.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> The RTC thereby declared the GSIS liable for petitioner’s indemnity claims for the damages brought about by the said typhoons, less the stipulated deductions under the policies, plus 6% legal interest from the dates of extra-judicial demand, as well as for attorney’s fees and costs of suit. It further dismissed for lack of merit GSIS’s counterclaim and third party complaint.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Dissatisfied, the GSIS elevated the matter to the CA.<br><br><center><b>The CA Ruling</b><br></center><br>In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> dated March 13, 2001, the CA set aside and reversed the RTC Judgment, thereby dismissing the complaint. It ruled that the complaint filed on September 27, 1991 was barred by prescription, having been commenced beyond the twelve-month limitation provided under the policies, reckoned from the final rejection of the indemnity claims on April 26, 1990 and June 21, 1990.<br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b><br></center><br>The essential issue for the Court’s resolution is whether or not the CA committed reversible error in dismissing the complaint on the ground of prescription.<br><br><b><center>The Court’s Ruling<br></center></b><br>The petition lacks merit.<br><br>Contracts of insurance, like other contracts, are to be construed according to the sense and meaning of the terms which the parties themselves have used. If such terms are clear and unambiguous, they must be taken and understood in their plain, ordinary, and popular sense.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Section 10<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> of the General Conditions of the subject CAR Policies commonly read:<br><br><blockquote>10. If a claim is in any respect fraudulent, or if any false declaration is made or used in support thereof, or if any fraudulent means or devices are used by the Insured or anyone acting on his behalf to obtain any benefit under this Policy, or<b> if a claim is made and rejected and no action or suit is commenced within twelve months after such rejection</b> or, in case of arbitration taking place as provided herein, within twelve months after the Arbitrator or Arbitrators or Umpire have made their award, <b>all benefit under this Policy shall be forfeited. </b>(Emphases supplied)</blockquote><br>In this relation, case law illumines that the prescriptive period for the insured’s action for indemnity should be reckoned from the “final rejection” of the claim.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Here, petitioner insists that the GSIS’s letters dated April 26, 1990 and June 21, 1990 did not amount to a “final rejection” of its claims, arguing that they were mere tentative resolutions pending further action on petitioner’s part or submission of proof in refutation of the reasons for rejection.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Hence, its causes of action for indemnity did not accrue on those dates.<br><br>The Court does not agree.<br><br>A perusal of the letter<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> dated April 26, 1990 shows that the GSIS denied petitioner’s indemnity claims wrought by Typhoons Biring and Huaning, it appearing that no amount was recoverable under the policies. While the GSIS gave petitioner the opportunity to dispute its findings, neither of the parties pursued any further action on the matter; this logically shows that they deemed the said letter as a rejection of the claims. Lest it cause any confusion, the statement in that letter pertaining to any queries petitioner may have on the denial should be construed, at best, as a form of notice to the former that it had the opportunity to seek reconsideration of the GSIS’s rejection. Surely, petitioner cannot construe the said letter to be a mere “tentative resolution.” In fact, despite its disavowals, petitioner admitted in its pleadings<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> that the GSIS indeed denied its claim through the aforementioned letter, but tarried in commencing the necessary action in court.<br><br>The same conclusion obtains for the letter<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> dated June 21, 1990 denying petitioner’s indemnity claim caused by Typhoon Saling on a “no loss” basis due to the non-renewal of the policies therefor before the onset of the said typhoon. The fact that petitioner filed a letter<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> of reconsideration therefrom dated April 18, 1991, considering too the inaction of the GSIS on the same similarly shows that the June 21, 1990 letter was also a final rejection of petitioner’s indemnity claim.<br><br>As correctly observed by the CA, “final rejection” simply means denial by the insurer of the claims of the insured and not the rejection or denial by the insurer of the insured’s motion or request for reconsideration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> The rejection referred to should be construed as <b>the rejection in the first instance,</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> as in the two instances above-discussed.<br><br>Comparable to the foregoing is the Court’s action in the case of<i> Sun Insurance Office, Ltd. v. CA</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> wherein it debunked “[t]he contention of the respondents [therein] that the one-year prescriptive period does not start to run until the petition for reconsideration had been resolved by the insurer,” holding that such view “runs counter to the declared purpose for requiring that an action or suit be filed in the Insurance Commission or in a court of competent jurisdiction from the denial of the claim.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> In this regard, the Court rationalized that “uphold[ing] respondents' contention would contradict and defeat the very principle which this Court had laid down. Moreover, it can easily be used by insured persons as a scheme or device to waste time until any evidence which may be considered against them is destroyed.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Expounding on the matter, the Court had this to say:<br><br><blockquote>The crucial issue in this case is: When does the cause of action accrue?<br><br>In support of private respondent’s view, two rulings of this Court have been cited, namely, the case of <i>Eagle Star Insurance Co. vs. Chia Yu </i>([supra note 41]), where the Court held:<br><br><blockquote>The right of the insured to the payment of his loss accrues from the happening of the loss. However, the cause of action in an insurance contract does not accrue until the insured’s claim is finally rejected by the insurer. This is because before such final rejection there is no real necessity for bringing suit.<br></blockquote>and the case of <i>ACCFA vs. Alpha Insurance &amp; Surety Co., Inc.</i> (24 SCRA 151 [1968], holding that:<br><blockquote><br>Since “cause of action” requires as essential elements not only a legal right of the plaintiff and a correlated obligation of the defendant in violation of the said legal right, the cause of action does not accrue until the party obligated (surety) refuses, expressly or impliedly, to comply with its duty (in this case to pay the amount of the bond).”</blockquote>Indisputably, the above-cited pronouncements of this Court may be taken to mean that the insured’s cause of action or his right to file a claim either in the Insurance Commission or in a court of competent jurisdiction [as in this case] commences from the time of the denial of his claim by the Insurer, either expressly or impliedly.<br><br>But as pointed out by the petitioner insurance company, the rejection referred to should be construed as the rejection, in the first instance, for if what is being referred to is a reiterated rejection conveyed in a resolution of a petition for reconsideration, such should have been expressly stipulated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></blockquote><br>In light of the foregoing, it is thus clear that petitioner’s causes of action for indemnity respectively accrued from its receipt of the letters dated April 26, 1990 and June 21, 1990, or the date the GSIS rejected its claims in the first instance. Consequently, given that it allowed more than twelve (12) months to lapse before filing the necessary complaint before the RTC on September 27, 1991, its causes of action had already prescribed.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.
