They contend that the respondent had sought to introduce in the proceedings before the LA Tabingo’s memorandum dated December 10, 1999 addressed to the Accounting Department stating that the “gross revenue from all publications was P36,022,624.07, while net revenue was P32,551,890.58”;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> that Tabingo’s affidavit was meant to validate her memorandum; that such pieces of evidence sought to prove that MMPI’s target gross sales had been met, and would then entitle the respondent to her claims of commissions and special incentives; that the LA actually considered but did not give any weight or value to Tabingo’s memorandum in resolving the respondent’s claims; that any affidavit from Tabingo that the respondent intended to introduce would be merely corroborative of the evidence already presented, like the table purportedly showing MMPI’s gross revenue for 1999; and that such evidence was already considered by the NLRC in resolving the appeal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>The important issue is whether or not the respondent was entitled to the commissions and the incentive bonus being claimed.<br><br><b><center>Ruling</center></b><br>The appeal is partly meritorious.<br><br>The grant of a bonus or special incentive, being a management prerogative, is not a demandable and enforceable obligation, except when the bonus or special incentive is made part of the wage, salary or compensation of the employee,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> or is promised by the employer and expressly agreed upon by the parties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> By its very definition, <i>bonus</i> is a gratuity or act of liberality of the giver,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> and cannot be considered part of an employee’s wages if it is paid only when profits are realized or a certain amount of productivity is achieved. If the desired goal of production or actual work is not accomplished, the bonus does not accrue.<br><br>Due to the nature of the bonus or special incentive being a gratuity or act of liberality on the part of the giver, the respondent could not validly insist on the schedule proposed in her memorandum of April 5, 1999 considering that the grant of the bonus or special incentive remained a management prerogative. However, the Court agrees with the CA’s ruling that the petitioners had already exercised the management prerogative to grant the bonus or special incentive. At no instance did Yap flatly refuse or reject the respondent’s request for commissions and the bonus or incentive. This is plain from the fact that Yap even “bargained” with the respondent on the schedule of the rates and the revenues on which the bonus or incentive would be pegged. What remained contested was only the schedule of the rates and the revenues. In her initial memorandum of February 25, 1999, the respondent had suggested the following schedule, namely: (<i>a</i>) 0.05% outright commission on total revenue of P28-P29 million; (<i>b</i>) 0.075% on P30-P34 million; (<i>c</i>) 0.1% on P35-P38 million; (<i>d</i>) 0.1% on P39-P41 million pesos; and (<i>f</i>) 0.1% on P41 million or higher, but Yap had countered by revising the schedule to start at 0.1% as outright commissions on a total revenue of P35-P38 million, and the special incentive bonus to start at revenues of P35-P38 million. Moreover, on December 8, 1999, Yap sent to the respondent a memorandum entitled <i>Re: Formalization of my handwritten approval of 1999 Incentive scheme dated 25 February 1999</i>. Such actuations and actions by Yap indicated that, firstly, the petitioners had already acceded to the grant of the special incentive bonus; and, secondly, the only issue still to be threshed out was at which point and at what rate the respondent’s outright commissions and the special incentive bonus for the sales staff should be given.<br><br>For sure, Yap’s memorandum dated December 8, 1999, aside from being the petitioners’ categorical admission of the grant of the commissions and the bonus or incentives, laid down the petitioners’ own schedule of the commissions and the bonus or incentives,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Re: Formalization of my handwritten approval of 1999 incentive scheme dated 25 February 1999<br><br><center><b><u>1999 Incentive Scheme for Group Publisher</u></b></center><br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="50%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">♦ MMPI Gross Advertising Revenue<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></td> <td width="25%"><div align="JUSTIFY">P35-38 M</div></td> <td width="25%"><div align="JUSTIFY">.05%</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(includes barter)</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">P39-41 M</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">.075%</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">P41 M up</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">1%</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="3"><div align="JUSTIFY"><b>Commissionable ad revenue is net of advertising agency commission and absorbed production costs.

Although, as a rule, the submission to the NLRC of additional evidence like documents and affidavits is not prohibited, so that the NLRC may properly consider such evidence for the first time on appeal,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> the circumstances of the case did not justify the application of the rule herein.<br><br>The additional evidence the respondent has sought to be admitted (<i>i.e</i>., Tabingo’s affidavit executed on October 14, 2002) was already attached to the pleadings filed in the NLRC, and was part of the records thereat. Its introduction was apparently aimed to rebut the petitioners’ claim that its gross revenue was only P31,947,677.00 and did not reach the minimum P35 million necessary for the grant of the respondent’s outright commissions and the special incentive bonus for the sales staff (inclusive of the respondent). Tabingo’s affidavit corroborated her memorandum to the Accounting Department dated December 10, 1999 stating that MMPI’s revenue for 1999 was P36,216,624.07.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Confronted with the conflicting claims on MMPI’s gross revenue realized in 1999, the question is which evidence must be given more weight?<br><br>The resolution of the question requires the re-examination and calibration of evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Such re-examination and calibration, being of a factual nature, ordinarily lies beyond the purview of the Court’s authority in this appeal. Yet, because the documents are already before the Court, we hereby treat the situation as an exception in order to resolve the question promptly and finally instead of still remanding the case to the CA for the re- evaluation and calibration.<br><br>We start by observing that the degree of proof required in labor cases is not as stringent as in other types of cases.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> This liberal approach affords to the employee every opportunity to level the playing field in which her employer is pitted against her. Here, on the one hand, were Tabingo’s memorandum and affidavit indicating that MMPI’s revenues in 1999 totaled P36,216,624.07, and, on the other, the audit report showing MMPI’s gross revenues amounting to only P31,947,677.00 in the same year. That the audit report was rendered by the auditing firm of Punongbayan &amp; Araullo did not make it weightier than Tabingo’s memorandum and affidavit, for only substantial evidence – that amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> - was required in labor adjudication. Moreover, whenever the evidence presented by the employer and that by the employee are in equipoise, the scales of justice must tilt in favor of the latter.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> For purposes of determining whether or not the petitioners’ gross revenue reached the minimum target of P35 million, therefore, Tabingo’s memorandum and affidavit sufficed to positively establish that it did, particularly considering that Tabingo’s memorandum was made in the course of the performance of her official tasks as a traffic clerk of MMPI. In her affidavit, too, Tabingo asserted that her issuance of the memorandum was pursuant to MMPI’s year-end procedures, an assertion that the petitioners did not refute. In any event, Tabingo’s categorical declaration in her affidavit that “[because] of that achievement, as part of the Sales and Traffic Team of MMPI, in addition to my other bonuses that year, I received P8,500.00 in gift certificates as my share in the Group Incentive for the Sales and Traffic Team for gross advertising revenue of P35 to P38 million xxx,”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> aside from the petitioners not refuting it, was corroborated by the 1999 Advertising Target sent by the respondent to Yap on December 2, 1999, in which the respondent reported a gross revenue of P36,216,624.07 as of December 1, 1999.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, the Court concludes that the respondent was entitled to her 0.05% outright commissions and to the special incentive bonus of P8,500.00 based on MMPI having reached the minimum target of P35 million in gross revenues paid in “bartered goods and cash in direct proportion to percentage of cash and bartered goods revenue for the year,” as provided in Yap’s memorandum of December 8, 1999.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court <b>REVERSES AND SETS ASIDE</b> the amended decision promulgated on November 19, 2003; <b>ENTERS</b> a new decision granting respondent Margaret A.
