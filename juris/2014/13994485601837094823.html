No. 03635 affirming <i>in toto </i>the Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> in Criminal Case No. Q-06-144482 rendered by the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 103 of Quezon City.&nbsp; The RTC Decision found Freddie Ladip y Rubio (accused) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Section 5, Article II of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9165, otherwise known as the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.<br><br><b><i><center>The Facts<br></center></i></b><br>The accused was charged under the Information<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> docketed as Criminal Case No. Q-06-144482 for violation of Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 (illegal sale of dangerous drugs), which reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote>That on or about 7<sup>th</sup> day of December, 2006, in Quezon City, accused without lawful authority did then and there willfully and unlawfully sell, trade, administer, dispense, deliver, give away to another, distribute, dispatch in transit or transport, or act as broker in the said transaction, a dangerous drug, to wit: zero point thirteen (0.13) gram of white crystalline substance containing [methamphetamine] hydrochloride.</blockquote><br>Upon arraignment, the accused pleaded not guilty to said charge.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>&nbsp; Thereafter, a full-blown trial ensued.<br><br><i>The Prosecution’s Version of Facts</i><br><br>The prosecution presented Police Officer (PO) 1 Marcelino Sibal (PO1 Sibal) and PO1 Romeo Tayag (PO1 Tayag), who both testified that while on duty in the morning of 7 December 2006, together with other police operatives namely: PO2 Zamora, PO1 Almario, and PO2 Salas, at the Station Anti-Illegal Drugs (SAID) - Station Operation Task Group, Quirino Police Station (PS-09), Anonas Road, Project 2, Quezon City, a male confidential informant came to the station and provided them with the information that a certain Freddie Ladip was selling illegal drugs in Area 1, <i>Barangay </i>Batasan, Quezon City.&nbsp; Consequently, a buy-bust operation was conducted on the same day whereupon the accused was arrested for selling methamphetamine hydrochloride or<i> shabu.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>As narrated during the trial, PO1 Sibal, who acted as poseur-buyer, and the informant went to a house located in the abovementioned area around 1 o’clock in the afternoon of 7 December 2006, wherein the accused was already waiting for them outside the said house.&nbsp; The informant introduced PO1 Sibal to the accused as a buyer of<i> shabu.</i> Accused immediately inquired as to the quantity of shabu that he intends to purchase by asking, <i>“magkano?”</i>&nbsp; PO1 Sibal replied that he wanted to buy P300.00 worth of<i> shabu</i>.&nbsp; Accused then asked for the payment, for which PO1 Sibal readily gave him the marked money consisting of three 100-peso bills.&nbsp; In return, accused handed to PO1 Sibal a transparent heat-sealed plastic sachet containing white crystalline granules.&nbsp; Upon the exchange and conveyance of <i>shabu</i> and the marked money having been completed, PO1 Sibal gave the pre-arranged signal by removing the cap from his head to signify to his back-up team, strategically stationed near the scene of the crime, that the transaction was consummated.&nbsp; Afterwards, the accused was arrested by the team.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>While the accused was being apprehended, a certain Perlyn Urbano y Dela Cruz (Perlyn) suddenly emerged before them, hysterically shouting and asking why her husband was being arrested, and even attempted to prevent the police operatives from consummating said arrest.&nbsp; Simultaneously, PO1 Tayag, being one of the back-up team, approached them and recovered another heat-sealed plastic sachet on the ground near Perlyn.&nbsp; Thereafter, both accused and Perlyn were brought to the police station where they were detained and investigated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>It was further stated under oath that, prior to the turnover of the evidence to the investigator-on-duty in said station, PO1 Sibal and PO1 Tayag revealed that they placed their respective markings on the two (2) small heat sealed transparent plastic sachets,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> denominated as MS-FL-12-07-06 and RT-PU-12-07-06.&nbsp; Subsequently, an inventory of the seized items was made in the presence of the police operatives and the arrested persons. Photographs of the arrested persons, the marked money, and the seized items were likewise taken, followed by various requests for laboratory examination of said specimens, and for drug dependency examination of the arrested persons.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>&nbsp; Later on, the subject sachets were brought to the Quezon City Police District (QCPD) Crime Laboratory.<br><br>Lastly, it was agreed upon by both parties to dispense with the testimony of the other prosecution’s witness, Police Inspector (P/Insp.)

No. 9165, thus, destroying the identity and integrity of the evidence against him; that there were inconsistencies in the testimonial evidence presented by the prosecution; and that ultimately, the prosecution miserably failed to prove the accused’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The CA affirmed <i>in toto</i> the decision of the RTC and dismissed the appeal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; The appellate court ruled that the prosecution’s evidence established the essential elements of the crime.&nbsp; It held that failure to comply with Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165 will not render the arrest of the accused illegal, nor will it result to the inadmissibility in evidence against the accused of the illegal drugs seized in the course of the entrapment operation.&nbsp; What is of utmost relevance is the preservation of the integrity and maintenance of the evidentiary value of the confiscated illegal drugs, for in the end, the same shall necessarily be the thrust that shall determine the guilt or innocence of the accused.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; More so, the CA emphasized that in the prosecution of offenses relating to illegal sale, peddling and conveyance of prohibited drugs, what is of material and pivotal importance is proof that the sale of drugs actually took place, coupled with the presentation of the <i>corpus delicti</i> as evidence,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> and furthermore, that there is no showing of any <i>indicia</i> of ill or improper motive on the part of the police operatives to impute such serious crime against accused as manifested by their witnesses’ spontaneous and categorical declarations and account of the incident.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; These were all established and proven beyond reasonable doubt in the instant case.<br><br>When the case was elevated to this Court, accused, through the Public Attorney’s Office, and the Office of the Solicitor General, both manifested that they would no longer file their respective supplemental brief and, instead, they would adopt all the arguments in their briefs filed before the CA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; In his Appellant’s Brief,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> accused raised the following assignment of errors: (a) the court <i>a quo </i>gravely erred in convicting the accused-appellant notwithstanding the prosecution’s failure to establish the chain of custody and integrity of the alleged seized illegal drugs; (b) the court <i>a quo</i> gravely erred in convicting the accused-appellant notwithstanding the prosecution witnesses’ incredible and highly inconsistent testimonies; and (c) the court <i>a quo</i> gravely erred in convicting the accused-appellant despite the prosecution’s failure to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br><center><b><i>The Issues</i></b></center><br>Posed for resolution is whether or not the accused is guilty of illegal sale of dangerous drugs; and of similar importance is the course of the investigation and trial.<br><br>Ultimately, the above issues may be consolidated, to wit: whether or not the RTC and the CA erred in finding that the evidence of the prosecution was sufficient to convict the accused of the alleged sale of methamphetamine hydrochloride or <i>shabu</i>, in violation of Section 5 of R.A. No. 9165.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b></center><br>The Court finds no merit in the appeal.<br><br>It has been consistently ruled that for the successful prosecution of offenses involving the illegal sale of drugs under Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165, the following elements must be proven: (1) the identity of the buyer and seller, object and consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; In other words, there is a need to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the accused actually sold and delivered a prohibited drug to another, and that the former indeed knew that what he had sold and delivered to the latter was a prohibited drug.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; To reiterate, what is material to the prosecution for illegal sale of dangerous drugs is the proof that the transaction or sale actually took place, plus the presentation in court of <i>corpus delicti </i>as evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Contrary to the claim of accused, the prosecution was able to clearly recount how the buy-bust operation<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> was conducted, and the eventual submission of the subject sachet of <i>shabu</i> as part of its evidence.&nbsp; We note that during the direct examination of the prosecution’s witness, PO1 Sibal, he categorically testified

buy-bust operation conducted, showing that accused sold and delivered the <i>shabu</i> for P300.00 to PO1 Sibal, the poseur-buyer.&nbsp; PO1 Sibal himself testified that there was an actual exchange of the marked money and the prohibited drug.&nbsp; Certainly, accused was fully aware that what he was selling was illegal and prohibited.&nbsp; Thereafter, the <i>corpus delicti </i>or the subject drug was seized, marked, and subsequently identified as a prohibited drug.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>It cannot be overemphasized that in cases involving violations of Dangerous Drugs Act, credence should be given to the narration of the incident by the prosecution witnesses especially when they are police officers who are presumed to have performed their duties in a regular manner, unless there is evidence to the contrary.&nbsp; In this regard, the defense failed to show any ill motive or odious intent on the part of the police operatives to impute such a serious crime that would put in jeopardy the life and liberty of an innocent person, such as in the case of accused.&nbsp; Incidentally, if these were simply trumped-up charges against him, it remains a question why no administrative charges were brought against the police operatives.&nbsp; Moreover, in weighing the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses vis-à-vis those of the defense, it is a well-settled rule that in the absence of palpable error or grave abuse of discretion on the part of the trial judge, the trial court’s evaluation of the credibility of witnesses will not be disturbed on appeal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Again, in the absence of any showing that substantial or relevant facts bearing on the elements of the crime have been misapplied or overlooked, this Court can only accord full credence to such factual assessment of the trial court which had the distinct advantage of observing the demeanor and conduct of the witnesses during the trial.&nbsp; Absent any proof of motive to falsely charge an accused of such a grave offense, the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty and the findings of the trial court with respect to the credibility of witnesses shall prevail over his bare allegation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>With the illegal sale of dangerous drugs established beyond reasonable doubt, the handling of the evidence, or the observance of the proper chain of custody, which is also an indispensable factor in prosecution for illegal sale of dangerous drugs, is the next matter to be resolved.<br><br>The point, understandably, of the accused is noncompliance by the arresting officers with Section 21, Article II of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of R.A. No. 9165 regarding the chain of custody of&nbsp; seized drugs, particularly as to the following: (a) that no copy of the inventory was given to the accused or his representative; (b) that no photographs were taken in the presence of a representative from the media or the DOJ or any elected public officer; and (c) that there was no explanation of how the alleged sachets of <i>shabu</i> were handled and disposed of from the time these were turned-over to the crime laboratory, up to their presentation in court, is fatal to the prosecution’s case against him.&nbsp; Resolving this matter is of utmost importance because if proven, substantial gaps in the chain of custody of the seized drugs would cast serious doubts on the authenticity of the evidence presented in court and would then entitle the accused to an acquittal.<br><br>We are not persuaded by these arguments.<br><br>This Court has time and again spoken on the chain of custody rule,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> a method of authenticating evidence which requires that the admission of an exhibit be preceded by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what the proponent claims it to be.&nbsp; This would include testimony about every link in the chain, from the moment the item was picked up to the time it is offered in evidence, in such a way that every person who touched the exhibit would describe how and from whom it was received, where it was and what happened to it while in the witness’ possession, the condition in which it was received and the condition in which it was delivered to the next link in the chain.&nbsp; These witnesses would then describe the precautions taken to ensure that there had been no change in the condition of the item and no opportunity for someone not in the chain to have possession of the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>In<i> People v. Salonga,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> we held that it is essential for the prosecution to prove that the prohibited drug confiscated or recovered from the suspect is the very same substance offered in court as exhibit.&nbsp; Its identity must be established with unwavering exactitude for it to lead to a finding of guilt.&nbsp; Thus, drug enforcement agents and police officers involved in a buy-bust operation are required under R.A. No. 9165 and its implementing rules to mark all seized evidence at the buy-bust scene.&nbsp; Section 21 (a), Article II of the IRR, states:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 21. Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment. x x x<br><br><blockquote>(a)&nbsp; The apprehending officer/team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof: Provided, that the physical inventory and photograph shall be conducted at the place where the search warrant is served; or at the nearest police station or at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable, in case of warrantless seizures; Provided, further, that non-compliance with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures of and custody over said items;</blockquote></blockquote><br>As often as there are occasions to apply the chain of custody rule, the Court has pronounced that the requirements under R.A. No. 9165 and its IRR are not inflexible.&nbsp; What is essential is “the preservation of the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items, as the same would be utilized in the determination of the guilt or innocence of the accused.” <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; Thus:<br><br><blockquote>From the point of view of jurisprudence, we are not beating any new path by holding that the failure to undertake the required photography and immediate marking of seized items may be excused by the unique circumstances of a case.&nbsp; In <i>People v. Resurreccion</i>, we already stated that “marking upon immediate confiscation" does not exclude the possibility that marking can be at the police station or office of the apprehending team.&nbsp; In the cases of <i>People v. Rusiana, People v. Hernandez,</i> and <i>People v. Gum-Oyen, </i>the apprehending team marked the confiscated items at the police station and not at the place of seizure. Nevertheless, we sustained the conviction because the evidence showed that the integrity and evidentiary value of the items seized had been preserved.&nbsp; To reiterate what we have held in past cases, <b>we are not always looking for the strict step-by-step adherence to the procedural requirements; what is important is to ensure the preservation of the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items, as these would determine the guilt or innocence of the accused. </b> We succinctly explained this in <i>People v. Del Monte</i> when we held:<br><br><blockquote><b>We would like to add that non-compliance with Section 21 of said law, particularly the making of the inventory and the photographing of the drugs confiscated and/or seized, will not render the drugs inadmissible in evidence.</b>&nbsp; Under Section 3 of Rule 128 of the Rules of Court, evidence is admissible when it is relevant to the issue and is not excluded by the law or these rules.&nbsp; For evidence to be inadmissible, there should be a law or rule which forbids its reception.&nbsp; If there is no such law or rule, the evidence must be admitted subject only to the evidentiary weight that will [be] accorded it by the courts. x x x<br><br><b>We do not find any provision or statement in said law or in any rule that will bring about the non-admissibility of the confiscated and/or seized drugs due to non-compliance with Section 21 of Republic Act No. 9165. The issue therefore, if there is non-compliance with said section, is not of admissibility, but of weight — evidentiary merit or probative value — to be given the evidence.</b> The weight to be given by the courts on said evidence depends on the circumstances obtaining in each case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote></blockquote><br>From the testimonies of the police officers in the case at bench, the prosecution established that they had custody of the drugs seized from the accused from the moment he was arrested, during the time he was transported to the police station, and up to the time the drugs were submitted to the crime laboratory for examination.&nbsp; The same witnesses also identified the seized drugs with certainty when these were presented in court. With regard to the handling of the seized drugs, there are no conflicting testimonies or glaring inconsistencies that would cast doubt on the integrity thereof as evidence presented and scrutinized in court.&nbsp; It is therefore safe to conclude that, to the unprejudiced mind, the testimonies show without a doubt that the evidence seized from the accused at the time of the buy-bust operation was the same one tested, introduced, and testified to in court.&nbsp; In short, there is no question as to the integrity of the evidence against the accused.<br><br>By way of reiteration, although this Court finds that the police officers did not strictly comply with the requirements of Section 21, Article II of the IRR implementing R.A. No. 9165, the noncompliance did not affect the evidentiary weight of the drugs seized from the accused, because the chain of custody of the evidence was shown to be unbroken under the circumstances of the case. As correctly found by the appellate court, the drugs confiscated from the accused were properly accounted for and forthrightly submitted to the Crime Laboratory for its extensive examination. The CA further ruled that nothing invited the suspicion that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized articles were jeopardized.<br><br>In fine, considering the pieces of evidence presented by the prosecution, the denial of the accused-appellant fails.&nbsp; Courts generally view the defense of denial with disfavor due to the facility with which an accused can concoct it to suit his or her defense.&nbsp; As evidence that is both negative and self-serving, this defense cannot attain more credibility than the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses who testify clearly, providing thereby positive evidence on the various aspects of the crime committed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Also, it is a well-entrenched principle that findings of fact of the trial court as to the credibility of witnesses are accorded great weight and respect when no glaring errors, gross misapprehension of facts, and speculative, arbitrary and unsupported conclusions can be gathered from such findings. The rationale behind this rule is that the trial court is in a better position to decide the credibility of witnesses, having heard their testimonies and observed their deportment and manner of testifying during trial.&nbsp; This rule finds an even more stringent application where said findings are sustained by the Court of Appeals.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; This Court does not find any convincing reason to depart from the ruling of the trial court, which was affirmed by the appellate court.&nbsp; Thus, we affirm the assailed Decision of the appellate court and uphold the conviction of the accused.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is <b>DENIED</b>.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals Decision in CA-G.R.
