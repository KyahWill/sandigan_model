Section 2, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court (Rules) reads:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 2. <i>Petition for Prohibition</i>. - When the proceedings of any tribunal, corporation, board, officer or person, whether exercising judicial, quasi-judicial or ministerial functions, are without or in excess of its or his jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, and there is no appeal or any other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, a person aggrieved thereby may file a verified petition in the proper court, alleging the facts with certainty and <b>praying that judgment be rendered commanding the respondent to desist from further proceedings in the action or matter specified therein</b>, or otherwise granting such incidental reliefs as law and justice may require.<br><br>x x x x (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>While the Court, Court of Appeals and Regional Trial Court have original concurrent jurisdiction to issue writs of <i>certiorari,</i> prohibition and mandamus, if what is assailed relates to “acts or omissions of a lower court or of a corporation, board, officer or person,” the petition must be filed “in the Regional Trial Court exercising jurisdiction over the territorial area as defined by the Court.” Section 4 of the same Rules provides that:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 4.<i> When and Where to file the petition.</i> - The petition shall be filed not later than sixty (60) days from notice of the judgment, order or resolution. In case a motion for reconsideration or new trial is timely filed, whether such motion is required or not, the petition shall be filed not later than sixty (60) days counted from the notice of the denial of the motion.<br><br><b>If the petition relates to an act or an omission of a municipal trial court or of a corporation, a board, an officer or a person, it shall be filed with the Regional Trial Court exercising jurisdiction over the territorial area as defined by the Supreme Court</b>. It may also be filed with the Court of Appeals or with the Sandiganbayan, whether or not the same is in aid of the court’s appellate jurisdiction. If the petition involves an act or an omission of a quasi-judicial agency, unless otherwise provided by law or these rules, the petition shall be filed with and be cognizable only by the Court of Appeals.<br><br>x x x x (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The foregoing rule corresponds to Section 21 (1) of Batas PambansaBlg. 129,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> otherwise known as “The Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980” (BP 129), which gives Regional Trial Courts original jurisdiction over cases of <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition, <i>mandamus, quo warranto, habeas corpus</i>, and injunction but lays down the limitation that the writs issued therein are enforceable only within their respective territorial jurisdictions.The pertinent provision reads:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 21. Original jurisdiction in other cases.– Regional Trial Courts shall exercise original jurisdiction:<br><br>(1)&nbsp; In the issuance of writs of certiorari, prohibition, mandamus, quo warranto, habeas corpus and injunction, which <b>may be enforced in any part of their respective regions</b>;<br><br>x x x x (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The Court already ruled in numerous cases, beginning with the very early case of <i>Castaño v. Lobingier</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> that the power to administer justice conferred upon judges of the Regional Trial Courts, formerly Courts of First Instance(CFI), can only be exercised within the limits of their respective districts, outside of which they have no jurisdiction whatsoever. Applying previous legislation similar to the present Section 21 of BP 129 and its complementary provision,<i> i.e.</i>, Section 4, Rule 65 of the Rules, the Court held in said case that the CFI of Leyte had no power to issue writs of injunction and <i>certiorari </i>against the Justice of the Peace of Manila, as the same was outside the territorial boundaries of the issuing court. Also, in <i>Samar Mining Co., Inc. v. Arnado,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40] </sup>a petition for<i> certiorari</i> and prohibition with preliminary injunction was filed in the CFI of Manila to question the authority of the Regional Administrator and Labor Attorney of the Department of Labor in Cebu City to hear a complaint for sickness compensation in Catbalogan, Samar and to enjoin said respondents from conducting further proceedings thereat. The Court affirmed the dismissal of the case on the ground of improper venue, holding that the CFI of Manila had no authority to issue writs of injunction, <i>certiorari,</i> and prohibition affecting persons outside its territorial boundaries. Further, in both <i>Cudiamat v. Torres (Cudiamat)</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41] </sup><i>and National Waterworks and Sewerage Authority v. Reyes</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> (NAWASA), the losing bidders succeeded in securing an injunctive writ from the CFI of Rizal in order to restrain, in <i>Cudiamat,</i> the implementation of an award on a public bidding for the supply of a police call and signal box system for the City of Manila, and, in <i>NAWASA,</i> the conduct of the public bidding for the supply of steel pipes for its Manila and Suburbs Waterworks Project. The Court held in both cases that the injunction issued by the CFI of Rizal purporting to restrain acts outside the province of Rizal was null and void for want of jurisdiction.<br><br>Undoubtedly, applying the aforementioned precepts and pronouncements to the instant case, the writ of prohibition issued by the Manila RTC in order to restrain acts beyond the bounds of the territorial limits of its jurisdiction (<i>i.e.,</i> in Iligan City) is null and void.<br><br>Also on a matter of procedure, the Court further discerns that the Manila RTC should have dismissed the case outright for failure of Atlanta to exhaust administrative remedies. Under RA 9184, the decisions of the BAC in all stages of procurement may be protested to the head of the procuring entity through a verified position paper and upon payment of a protest fee.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> The necessity for the complaining bid participant to complete the protest process before resorting to court action cannot be overemphasized. It is a condition precedent to the court’s taking cognizance of an action that assails a bid process.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> When precipitately taken prior to the completion of the protest process, such case shall be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> While Atlanta may have written the BAC a letter objecting to some of the terms and conditions contained in the bidding documents to be used for the re-bidding, its action fell short of the required protest. It failed to follow through with its protest and opted instead to participate in the re-bidding with full knowledge that the IBRD Procurement Guidelines were to be followed throughout the conduct of the bid. Having failed to observe the protest procedure required by law, Atlanta’s case should not have prospered with the RTC altogether.<br><br>With the procedural matters having been resolved, the Court now proceeds to discuss the substantive aspect of this case concerning the SLA and Land Bank’s claimed exemption from the provisions of RA 9184.<br><br><ol start="2" type="A"><li><b>SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES:<br><br>THE APPLICABILITY OF THE BIDDING PROCEDURE UNDER RA 9184; AND THE NATURE OF LOAN NO. 4833-PH AND ITS RELATION TO THE SLA.<br>____________________________________</b></li></ol><br>While mandating adherence to the general policy of the government that contracts for the procurement of civil works or supply of goods and equipment shall be undertaken only after competitive public bidding, RA 9184 recognizes the country’s commitment to abide by its obligations under any treaty or international or executive agreement. This is pertinently provided in Section 4 of RA 9184 which reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 4. <i>Scope and Application</i>. – This Act shall apply to the Procurement of Infrastructure Projects, Goods and Consulting Services, regardless of source of funds, whether local or foreign, by all branches and instrumentalities of the government, its department, offices and agencies, including government owned and/or - controlled corporations and local government units, subject to the provisions of Commonwealth Act No. 138.&nbsp; <b>Any treaty or international or executive agreement affecting the subject matter of this Act to which the Philippine government is a signatory shall be observed.</b> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The IRR of RA 9184 further supplements the law’s treatment of treaties and international or executive agreements as follows:<br><blockquote>Section 4.

In <i>Bayan Muna v. Romulo</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> (<i>Bayan Muna</i>) the Court defined an international agreement as one concluded between states in written form and governed by international law, “whether embodied in a single instrument or in two or more related instruments and whatever its particular designation,”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> and further expounded that it may be in the form of either (<i>a</i>) treaties that require legislative concurrence after executive ratification; or (<i>b</i>) <b>executive agreements that are similar to treaties, except that they do not require legislative concurrence and are usually less formal and deal with a narrower range of subject matters than treaties</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49] </sup>Examining its features, Loan Agreement No. 4833-PH between the IBRD and the Land Bank is an integral component of the Guarantee Agreement executed by the <b>Government of the Philippines </b>as a subject of international law possessed of a treaty-making capacity, and <b>the IBRD</b>, which, as an international lending institution organized by world governments to provide loans conditioned upon the guarantee of repayment by the borrowing sovereign state, is likewise regarded a subject of international law and possessed of the capacity to enter into executive agreements with sovereign states. Being similar to a treaty but without requiring legislative concurrence, Loan Agreement No. 4833-PH – following the definition given in the <i>Bayan Muna </i>case –is an executive agreement and is, thus, governed by international law.Owing to this classification, the Government of the Philippines is therefore obligated to observe its terms and conditions under the rule of <i>pacta sunt servanda</i>, a fundamental maxim of international law that requires the parties to keep their agreement in good faith.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> It bears pointing out that the <i>pacta sunt servanda</i> rule has become part of the law of the land through the incorporation clause found under Section 2, Article II of the 1987 Philippine Constitution, which states that the Philippines “adopts the generally accepted principles of international law as part of the law of the land and adheres to the policy of peace, equality, justice, freedom, cooperation, and amity with all nations.”Keeping in mind the foregoing attributions, the Court now examines the SLA and its relation with Loan Agreement No. 4833-PH.<br><br>As may be palpably observed, the terms and conditions of Loan Agreement No. 4833-PH, being a project-based and government-guaranteed loan facility, were <b>incorporated and made part of the SLA</b> that was subsequently entered into by Land Bank with the City Government of Iligan.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Consequently, this means that the SLA cannot be treated as an independent and unrelated contract but as a conjunct of, or having a joint and simultaneous occurrence with, Loan Agreement No. 4833-PH. <b>Its nature and consideration, being a mere accessory contract of Loan Agreement No. 4833-PH, are thus the same as that of its principal contract from which it receives life and without which it cannot exist as an independent contract.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Indeed, the accessory follows the principal;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> and, concomitantly, accessory contracts should not be read independently of the main contract.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Hence, as Land Bank correctly puts it, the SLA has attained indivisibility with the Loan Agreement and the Guarantee Agreement through the incorporation of each other’s terms and conditions such that the character of one has likewise become the character of the other.<br><br>Considering that Loan Agreement No. 4833-PH expressly provides that the procurement of the goods to be financed from the loan proceeds shall be in accordance with the IBRD Guidelines and the provisions of Schedule 4, and that the accessory SLA contract merely follows its principal’s terms and conditions, the procedure for competitive public bidding prescribed under RA 9184 therefore finds no application to the procurement of goods for the Iligan City Water Supply System Development and Expansion Project.&nbsp; The validity of similar stipulations in foreign loan agreements requiring the observance of IBRD Procurement Guidelines in the procurement process has, in fact, been previously upheld by the Court in the case of<i> Department of Budget and Management Procurement Service (DBM-PS) v. Kolonwel Trading</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> <i>viz</i>.:<br><br><blockquote>The question as to whether or not foreign loan agreements with international financial institutions, such as Loan No. 7118-PH, partake of an executive or international agreement within the purview of Section 4 of R.A. No. 9184, has been answered by the Court in the affirmative in [<i>Abaya v. Sec. Ebdane, Jr., </i>544 Phil. 645 (2007)].&nbsp; Significantly, Abaya declared that the RP-JBIC loan agreement was to be of governing application over the CP I project and that the JBIC Procurement Guidelines, as stipulated in the loan agreement, shall primarily govern the procurement of goods necessary to implement the main project.<br><br>Under the fundamental international law principle of <i>pacta sunt servanda</i>, which is in fact embodied in the afore-quoted Section 4 of R.A. No. 9184, the RP, as borrower, bound itself to perform in good faith its duties and obligation under Loan No. 7118-PH. Applying this postulate in the concrete to this case, the IABAC was legally obliged to comply with, or accord, primacy to, the WB Guidelines on the conduct and implementation of the bidding/procurement process in question.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></blockquote><br>With the nature and treatment of Loan Agreement No. 4833-PH as well as its accessory SLA herein explained, the Court thus holds that the RTC committed reversible error in ruling that the provisions of RA 9184 were to be applied in this case. Quite the contrary, it is the IBRD Guidelines and the provisions of Schedule 4 which should govern.
