				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This appeal by <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> assails the October 11, 2012 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and the March 1, 2013 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Sandiganbayan in Criminal Case No. 27474, finding petitioner Alex M. Valencerina (<i>Valencerina</i>), together with Amalio A. Mallari (<i>Mallari</i>), guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Section 3(e) of Republic Act (<i>R.A.</i>) No. 3019, which provides as follows:<br><blockquote><b>Sec. 3. - Corrupt practices of public officers.</b> – In addition to acts or omissions of public officers already penalized by existing law, the following shall constitute corrupt practices of any public officer and are hereby declared to be unlawful:<br><br><center>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></center><br>(e) Causing any undue injury to any party, including the Government, or giving any private party any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his official administrative or judicial functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence. This provision shall apply to officers and employees of offices or government corporations charged with the grant of licenses or permits or other concessions.<br></blockquote>The Sandiganbayan found Valencerina, a high-ranking officer of the Government Service Insurance System (<i>GSIS</i>), guilty of giving unwarranted benefits to Ecobel Land Incorporated (<i>Ecobel</i>) on account of his participation in the unjustified issuance of GSIS Surety Bond GIF No. 029132 (<i>subject bond</i>) covering the amount of Ten Million US Dollars (US$10,000,000.00).<br><br><b>The Facts</b><br><br>As culled from the findings of the Sandiganbayan, it appears that sometime in October 1997, Ecobel, represented by its Chairman and accused Josephine E. Boright (<i>Boright</i>), applied for the issuance of a bond with GSIS to guarantee the repayment of a loan in the amount of US$10,000,000.00, supposedly obtained from the Philippine Veterans Bank (<i>PVB</i>) and allegedly for the construction of a 26-storey commercial/residential Ecobel Condominium Tower Building.<br><br>Boright approached accused Leticia G. Bernardo (<i>Bernardo</i>), the manager of the Suretyship Department of GSIS for said purpose. Bernardo gave Boright the checklist of requirements. Thereafter, Ecobel submitted the listed documents, except the loan agreement.<br><br>In a meeting held on December 10, 1997, the GSIS Underwriting Committee, chaired by Bernardo, “<i>approved in principle</i>” the surety bond application, but subject to “<i>analysis and evaluation of the project and the offered collaterals</i>.” It was noted in the same meeting that the collaterals offered were the project sites in Malate, Manila, under Transfer Certificate of Title (<i>TCT</i>) No. 227727 and in Lipa City under TCT No. 66289.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>On January 16, 1998, the Underwriting Committee refused TCT No. 227727 as collateral on the ground that it was already the subject of another mortgage. Under the GSIS policy, second mortgages were not allowed. Ecobel then presented TCT No. 66289 as its collateral.<br><br>On January 27, 1998, a memorandum was prepared by Valencerina upon the instructions of accused Mallari, who was then the Senior Vice-President of the GSIS General Insurance Group. It was addressed to the President and General Manager of GSIS (<i>PGM</i>) and contained an endorsement of Ecobel’s bond for evaluation of the GSIS Investment Committee. It also included Mallari’s strong recommendation through a marginal note with the words “<i>Strong reco. Based on info &amp; collateral herein stated</i>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>On March 10, 1998, the GSIS Investment Committee approved the subject bond. The following day, or on March 11, 1998, Surety Bond GIF No. 029132, a high-risk bond, was signed by Boright for Ecobel and by Mallari for the GSIS.<br><br>On March 30, 1998, Valencerina certified that the subject bond could be redeemed if Ecobel would default in paying the loan. The letter reads:<br><blockquote>30 March 1998<br><br>To Whom It May Concern:<br><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td width="5%">Re: </td><td width="20%">GSIS G(16) GIF Bond No. 029132</td><td width="75%">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Bond Amount: </td><td>US 10,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Issuing Date: </td><td>11 March 1998</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Maturing Date: </td><td>11 March 2000</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Bond Principal: </td><td>Ecobel Land Incorporated</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Project Bonded: </td><td>26-Storey Commercial/Residential</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Condominium Ecobel Tower Building</td></tr></tbody></table><br>This is to advise that the above-captioned surety bond may be redeemed following a default by the Bond Principal under the procedures set out below (the “DRAWING CONDITIONS”):<br><ol><li>presentation of original surety bond to GSIS at its office in either Manila or London; together with<br><br></li><li>presentation of demand for payment stating non-payment in full or in part by the Bond Principal; and<br><br></li><li>notification of assignment to GSIS of US Dollar loan obligations of the Bond Principal<br></li></ol>Upon receipt of the above documentation via courier, GSIS will confirm the default by the Bond Principal and will make full payment under the surety bond within ten (10) New York and London Banking days.<br><br>(Sgd.)<br><br>ALEX M.

GSIS has no counterclaim, defense or right of set-off with respect to the surety bond provided that DRAWING CONDITIONS have been satisfied.<br><br>We confirm that any such transfer requires only written or facsimile notification to GSIS by the then current obligee and confirmation or approval from GSIS is not required.<br><br>(Sgd.)<br><br>ALEX M. VALENCERINA<br><br>Cc: SVP J. Navarette<br><br>xxx.<br></blockquote>Eventually, accused Estela J. Edralin (<i>Edralin</i>), as a representative of Ecobel, signed on February 4, 1999 a Term Loan Agreement with Bear, Stearns International, Ltd. (<i>BSIL</i>). The following month, Ecobel made a drawdown from the loan in the amount of US$9,307,000.00.<br><br>On February 9, 1999, Valencerina approved the Suretyship Department’s request for a facultative reinsurance of the subject bond. On February 12, and 24, 1999, however, he wrote cancellation notices after he was informed by Atty. Norma M. Saludares (<i>Atty. Saludares</i>) that TCT No. 66289 was spurious. Meanwhile, Ecobel issued two post-dated checks both dated February 26, 1999, for P12,731,520.00 and US$330,000.00. The peso check was signed by Boright and paid in the Philippines, while the dollar check was signed by Edralin and paid in London.<br><br>On May 6, 1999, GSIS received a letter from Atty. Fernando U. Campaña (<i>Atty. Campaña</i>) of the GSIS-London Representative Office regarding Escobel’s premium payment in the amount of US$200,625.00 remitted to the Philippine National Bank (<i>PNB</i>)-London. Finally, on June 20, 1999, the Bond Cancellation Advice was issued for the reversal of the said premium payment of Escobel.<br><br>In a letter, dated March 7, 2000, URSA Minor Limited, the assignee of BSIL, demanded payment from Ecobel. A notice of failure was sent by Banker’s Trust, informing GSIS of Ecobel’s failure to pay the obligation which became due on March 9, 2001.<br><br>On April 5, 2000, Aon Financial Products, Inc., also a subsequent assignee of BSIL, sent a Notice of Demand to the then Secretary of Finance, Pardo de Tavera, calling on the guarantee of the Republic of the Philippines under the subject bond.<br><br>Thus, for having participated in, or contributed to the release or issuance of the subject surety bond, an Information was filed before the Sandiganbayan, against Valencerina, along with Campaña, Mallari, Leticia G. Bernardo, Josephine Edralin Boright, and Estela J. Edralin for violation of Sec. 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019. As per the Amended Information,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> the allegations were as follows:<br><blockquote>That on or about March 11, 1998, or sometime prior or subsequent thereto, in Metro Manila, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the abovenamed accused <b>ALEX M.

Edralin</b>, with the assistance of herein accused public officials, was able to obtain an actual drawdown of Ten Million US Dollars (US $10,000,000.00) from Bear and Stearns International Ltd., and subsequent thereto, despite knowledge of the cancellation of the Surety Bond and return or disregard of the premium payment earlier made, Fernando U. Campaña of the GSIS London Representative Office, received from Estela J. Edralin of Escobel Land Incorporated, the premium payment previously disregarded at the GSIS Manila Office, without the authority or official duty to do so, or even the consent of GSIS, and despite knowledge that Surety Bond No. 029132 was issued with PVB as Obligee and not Bears and Stearns International, Ltd., thereby affording unwarranted benefit, advantage or preference to Ecobel Land Incorporated and/or herein private accused, resulting [in] extreme prejudice to the interest of the government and to exposure to injury in the amount of the actual drawdown of Ten Million US Dollars (US $10,000,000.00)<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<br></blockquote>The People, through the Office of the Ombudsman, claimed that all the accused caused the Government injury and/or gave unwarranted benefits to Ecobel when they participated in the issuance of the subject surety bond, despite the obvious legal infirmities and irregularities which attended the same.<br><br>These infirmities include the following:<br><br><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">1)</div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify"> Absence of counter-bond prior to issuance as underwriting requirement to protect the interest of GSIS;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">2)</div></td><td><div align="justify"> Absence of sufficient collateral as underwriting safety requirement, as in fact TCT NO. 227727 had an existing encumbrance;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">3)</div></td><td><div align="justify"> Non-payment of the premium prior to issuance and approval of the Surety Bond as a mandatory and legal requirement;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">4)</div></td><td><div align="justify"> Issuance of the Surety Bond without the prior approval of the GSIS Board of Trustees required for high-risk bonds regardless of the amount;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">5) </div></td><td><div align="justify">Absence of a loan agreement between the bond principal Ecobel and the supposed obligee, Philippine Veterans Bank (PVB);</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">6)</div></td><td><div align="justify"> Issuance of the saidsSurety bond without prior approval from the Central Bank being a foreign-denominated bond;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">7) </div></td><td><div align="justify">Non-verification of the collateral/s submitted to ensure non-exposure to risks;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">8)</div></td><td><div align="justify"> Insufficient and highly irregular evaluation of the bond application and its supporting documents, or of the character, capacity and capital of the applicant, Ecobel Land Incorporated; and</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">9)</div></td><td><div align="justify"> TCT No. 66289, being one of the collaterals, was found to be spurious.</div></td></tr></tbody></table><br>All of those charged pleaded not guilty, except for Boright, who since then, had remained at large. Eventually, the case against Campaña was dismissed in the Sandiganbayan Resolution, dated August 3, 2003.<br><br>After the trial, the Sandiganbayan rendered the assailed decision, finding Valencerina and Mallari guilty beyond reasonable doubt and sentencing them to suffer the indeterminate penalty of imprisonment of six (6) years and one (1) month as minimum, up to ten (10) years as maximum, with perpetual disqualification from holding public office. Bernardo and Edralin were acquitted for failure of the prosecution to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Then, a warrant of arrest for accused Boright was issued.<br><br>The Sandiganbayan found that from the GSIS Underwriting Committee, the application for the issuance of the subject bond moved to the office of Valencerina, who then endorsed it for assessment of the GSIS Investment Committee. It stated that Valencerina must have known that Ecobel could not be given such bond to guarantee payment of a loan obtained from foreign entities because his position entailed knowledge of the fact that GSIS could only issue a guarantee payment bond if the government had an interest therein. Yet, despite this rule and his knowledge that the obligee was not actually PVB, as misrepresented by Ecobel, but a foreign funder, Valencerina still submitted the application to the PGM for the evaluation of the Investment Committee. The Sandiganbayan took this as proof of the presence of the element of the offense: that Valencerina acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence in giving unwarranted benefits in favor of Ecobel.<br><br>Moreover, the Sandiganbayan took note of the significant role Valencerina played for Ecobel even after the bond had been issued. It pointed out his participation in the loan negotiation between Ecobel and BSIL, with the certifications he himself issued which effectively made the transfer of the bond to an obligee, other than PVB, possible. It appeared that Boright requested Valencerina and Mallari to issue the certifications which were needed to facilitate the foreign loan.<br><br>Lastly, Valencerina’s declaration that the bond was fully secured by collaterals was taken by the Sandiganbayan against him as he already knew that the said collaterals were defective.<br><br>With respect to Mallari, his conviction was premised on the findings by the Sandiganbayan that he strongly recommended the Ecobel bond application for evaluation notwithstanding its infirmities; that he approved and subsequently signed the subject bond on behalf of GSIS; and that he knew beforehand that PVB was not the obligee of the loan as manifested in the correspondence he had with accused Boright, thus, highlighting his active participation in the negotiation with Bear and Stearns International, Ltd. on the subject bond.<br><br>Thus, the Sandiganbayan disposed:<br><blockquote><b>IN LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING,</b> the Court hereby renders judgment as follows:<br><br>1. Accused ALEX M. VALENCERINA and AMALIO A. MALLARI are found <b>GUILTY</b> beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019 and, pursuant to Section 9 thereof, are hereby sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of imprisonment of six (6) years and one (1) month as minimum, up to ten (10) years as maximum, with perpetual disqualification from holding office;<br><br>2. Accused LETICIA G. BERNARDO and ESTELA J. EDRALIN are hereby <b>ACQUITTED</b> for failure of the prosecution to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>Considering that the act or omission from which the civil liability might arise did not exist, no civil liability may be assessed against accused Bernardo and Edralin.<br><br>Let the hold-departure order against accused Bernardo and Edralin by reason of this case be lifted and set aside, and their bonds released, subject to the usual accounting and auditing procedure.<br><br>Let a warrant for the arrest of accused Josephine Edralin Boright be issued.

He posits that the pieces of evidence, both documentary and testimonial, supporting the Sandiganbayan’s judgment of conviction, were hearsay and incompetent, thus, without probative value and that the Sandiganbayan relied merely on the prosecution’s “xerox” exhibits (referring to the two certifications), which were not properly identified and authenticated, and, therefore, were not the best evidence to prove his guilt. He adds that the prosecution witnesses had no personal knowledge of the contents and due execution of the documents which were relied upon by the Sandiganbayan, including the incidents, transactions and events on which they testified on.<br><br>Valencerina further argues that the memorandum containing his endorsement of the bond application was issued in the performance of his functions and that the alleged act of giving unwarranted benefits in favor of Ecobel was not sufficiently proved as he was the one who cancelled the bond upon learning of the deficiencies in its issuance.<br><br>In its Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> the prosecution counters, among others, that when the Sandiganbayan considered and gave value to the faxed and photocopied documents claimed by Valencerina as hearsay and incompetent, no mistake was committed inasmuch as all objections raised were duly considered and that no objection was made during the formal offer of evidence. It cites as reference the ruling of this Court in <i>Interpacific Transit, Inc. v.

Moreover, the prosecution was of the view that even if the documents were inadmissible in evidence, conviction would still be inevitable as regards the act of giving undue advantage in favor of Ecobel because testimonial and documentary evidence overwhelmingly established his participation and [guilt]. As to his claim that the witnesses the prosecution presented in court had no personal knowledge of the matters testified upon, the prosecution argued that the testimonies procured were based on the authentic documents these witnesses themselves issued, seen, collated, gathered, reviewed, evaluated, investigated, and audited by reason of their office.<br><br>In his Reply,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Valencerina reiterates his submissions.<br><br>The Court is, thus, called to determine whether the Sandiganbayan erred in finding Valencerina guilty of violation of Section 3(e) of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.<br><br>Central to the proper determination of the correctness of the Sandiganbayan’s judgment is the question on whether the fact of giving undue preference with bad faith or evident partiality to Ecobel was proved beyond reasonable doubt by the testimonies of the witnesses and the documents presented by the prosecution.<br><br><center><b>The Court’s Ruling</b><br></center><br>First, it must be emphasized that irregularities did occur in the issuance of the subject bond. These irregularities were adequately proved by the testimonies of both the prosecution and the defense, together with the documentary evidence presented before the Sandiganbayan – that the security bond was issued without the adequate collaterals; that it was used to guarantee a high-risk foreign loan which was disqualified for lack of government interest in it; that it was issued without the approval of the Board of Trustees as required by GSIS for high-risk bonds; that it was issued without the premium for reinsurance being paid; and that Ecobel received undue benefits as it was able to make a drawdown from the loan by reason of the guarantee under the subject bond. All these were clearly established by the evidentiary records. It is also quite clear that the issues surrounding the Ecobel bond had exposed the government to unwarranted risks, which could have been avoided had steps been taken to consciously follow the policies of GSIS.<br><br>It is in this light that Valencerina was tried. His participation in the issuance of the subject bond was put to test to determine whether he violated Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019. The question, therefore, that remains is whether he, as found by the Sandiganbayan, had a hand in the act of giving unwarranted benefits to Ecobel with the issuance of the subject bond. Stated otherwise, did he participate in the giving of undue benefits to Ecobel with evident bad faith, or manifest partiality, as punishable under Sec. 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019, when the bond was issued and used by Ecobel to secure a foreign denominated loan?<br><br>The Court agrees with the Sandiganbayan in finding Valencerina guilty of violating Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 based upon the pieces of evidence presented by the prosecution.<br><br>In all criminal cases, the prosecution is burdened with the duty of establishing with proof beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of an accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> The determination of whether the prosecution has fulfilled such a heavy burden is left to the trial court, which, in turn, must be satisfied with moral certainty that an accused has indeed committed the crime on the basis of facts and circumstances to warrant a judgment of conviction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Otherwise, where there is reasonable doubt, acquittal must then follow.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The premise is that an accused is presumed innocent until the contrary is proved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>In finding Valencerina guilty of giving undue advantage or preference to Ecobel, in violation of Section 3(e) of the Anti Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, the Sandiganbayan was convinced that the elements of the crime were duly established. These elements, as enumerated by the Court in <i>Bautista v. Sandiganbayan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> are as follows:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(1) </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">the offender is a public officer;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(2)</div></td><td><div align="justify"> the act was done in the discharge of the public officer’s official, administrative or judicial functions;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(3)</div></td><td><div align="justify"> the act was done through manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence; and</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(4) </div></td><td><div align="justify">the public officer caused any undue injury to any party, including the Government, <b>or</b> gave any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference.</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>Being the Vice-President for Marketing and Support Services of GSIS, Valencerina was no doubt a public officer, and the alleged acts complained of were done while he was in office.<br><br>The Court also believes that the third and last constitutive elements were established. The Sandiganbayan correctly relied on the testimonies of the witnesses, which were based primarily on the January 27, 1998 Memorandum, and the Certifications, dated March 30, 1998 and January 14, 1999, issued by Valencerina himself. These documents purportedly showed his resignation to favor Ecobel in the issuance of the subject bond as well as his alleged participation in the negotiation of the loan sought to be guaranteed under the bond, thus, making him guilty of the offense charged.<br><br>The third element of the crime of violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 may be committed in three ways, that is, through manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence. Proof of <i>any</i> of these three in connection with the prohibited acts mentioned in Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 is enough to convict.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The Court expounds:<br><blockquote>[As defined], “[p]artiality” is synonymous with “bias” which “excites a disposition to see and report matters as they are wished for rather than as they are.” “Bad faith does not simply connote bad judgment or negligence; it imputes a dishonest purpose or some moral obliquity and conscious doing of a wrong; a breach of sworn duty through some motive or intent or ill will; it partakes of the nature of fraud.” “Gross negligence has been so defined as negligence characterized by the want of even slight care, acting or omitting to act in a situation where there is a duty to act, not inadvertently but wilfully and intentionally with a conscious indifference to consequences in so far as other persons may be affected. It is the omission of that care which even inattentive and thoughtless men never fail to take on their own property.” <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br></blockquote>In this case, Valencerina clearly extended, with evident bad faith, undue advantage to Ecobel in the process of issuing and negotiating the subject bond. His act of endorsing Ecobel’s application to the PGM despite his knowledge that the obligee of the loan was not PVB but a foreign lender, clearly shows his disregard for the policy of GSIS requiring the existence of governmental interest in the transaction. In the observation of the GSIS audit team, as it appeared in a report before the Sandiganbayan, PVB was merely used to show that GSIS has an insurable interest in the loan. The truth, however, is that BSIL was the funder and obligee of the credit sought to be guaranteed by the bond.<br><br>Valencerina admitted that he knew Ecobel would have a foreign funder at the time that he prepared the memorandum, despite knowing that to guarantee a loan obtained from a foreign funder was contrary to the policies of GSIS since no government interest was involved in it. The transcript reveals these statements as follows:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">Q </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">And on that basis you have made that statement in this memorandum and you are telling that to the Court?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A </div></td><td><div align="justify">Yes, I did, sir.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q </div></td><td><div align="justify">You are also alleged to have knowledge even at that time that the Ecobel who applied for payment guarantee bond would have foreign funder, do you confirm that?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A </div></td><td><div align="justify">Yes, sir, I was informed by Mr. Mallari about it, sir.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q </div></td><td><div align="justify">You know for a fact that an official of the GSIS, one requirement in the issuance of surety bond, you would see to it that there is a government interest in the transaction, do you remember that?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A </div></td><td><div align="justify">Yes, sir.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q </div></td><td><div align="justify">And yet in spite of your knowledge that eventually this bond would have a foreign funder, you made the endorsement to the President and General manager of the GSIS?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A </div></td><td><div align="justify">My information from Mr. Mallari is that the funds would have to be coursed to the Veterans Bank since the Philippine Veterans Bank is a government bank, it carries with it insurable interest of the government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>In addition, Valencerina’s declaration in the same memorandum to the PGM that the bond was fully secured by collaterals, strengthens the conclusion that he was in bad faith. As correctly observed by the Sandiganbayan, the collaterals presented by Ecobel appeared to be questionable. TCT No. 227727 had an existing mortgage while TCT No. 66289 was found to be spurious since it was different from what was on file with the Registry of Deeds of Lipa City. These circumstances clearly show that Valencerina failed to thoroughly review Ecobel’s compliance with GSIS policies before endorsing the application to the PGM. Thus, his endorsement of Ecobel’s application was nothing but a conscious doing of a wrong and a breach of his duty to uphold not only the interest of the GSIS but also of the Republic. It is clearly an indication of bad faith on his part as he should have realized that his position required the utmost prudence knowing that to guarantee a high-risk loan was, as the name implied, highly risky on the part of GSIS and could very well affect the entire membership of the system.<br><br>Valencerina’s defense that the memorandum was prepared and issued pursuant to the instructions of Mallari, who was higher in rank, cannot exculpate him from liability. As Vice-President, his duties were not mere perfunctory in the greater scheme of the process. He knew that GSIS could only issue a guarantee payment bond if it had an interest in the transaction, and that the bond must be secured by adequate collaterals. Yet, he still endorsed the Ecobel application which he could have denied at sight. He could have at least made some remarks as to the propriety of the application in light of his information that a foreign funder was the obligee of the loan which would violate GSIS policies in the issuance of a high-risk bond, but he did not.<br><br>The Court, moreover, notes the finding of the Sandiganbayan that Valencerina also participated in the negotiations of the loan using the guarantees available under the bond. It appears from the records that BSIL required Ecobel to verify the authenticity of the signatures in the subject bond. Boright then requested Mallari to issue certifications containing declarations that he was authorized to sign the subject bond, including a certification that he was authorized to sign certain letters that were requested apparently referring to the certifications that Valencerina himself issued on January 14, 1999, together with the first one he issued on March 30, 1998, both directed to an unnamed addressee. The certifications read as follows:<br><blockquote>30 March 1998<br><br>To Whom It May Concern:<br><br><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="5%">Re: </td><td width="20%">GSIS G(16) GIF Bond No. 029132</td><td width="75%">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Bond Amount: </td><td>US 10,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Issuing Date: </td><td>11 March 1998</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Maturing Date: </td><td>11 March 2000</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Bond Principal: </td><td>Ecobel Land Incorporated</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Project Bonded: </td><td>26-Storey Commercial/Residential</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Condominium Ecobel Tower Building<br><br></td></tr></tbody></table>This is to advise that the above-captioned surety bond may be redeemed following a default by the Bond Principal under the procedures set out below (the “DRAWING CONDITIONS”):<ol><li>presentation of original surety bond to GSIS at its office in either Manila or London; together with<br><br></li><li>presentation of demand for payment stating non-payment in full or in part by the Bond Principal; and<br><br></li><li>notification of assignment to GSIS of US Dollar loan obligations of the Bond Principal<br></li></ol>Upon receipt of the above documentation via courier, GSIS will confirm the default by the Bond Principal and will make full payment under the surety bond within ten (1) New York and London Banking days.<br><br>(Sgd.)<br><br>ALEX M.

It was even affirmed therein the validity of the obligation of GSIS under the subject bond, despite Valencerina knowing at that time that the bond had not been secured by adequate collaterals, and that the premium payment for reinsurance had not been paid. Records show that the said premium was paid only on February 26, 1999, or almost a year after the issuance of the bond. This would necessarily render the bond void because an insurance policy is valid only if the actual premium is paid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Worse, these certifications made the transfer of the bond effective as it was specifically mentioned by Valencerina that the bond may be transferred to BSIL and any of its assignees. This he did despite knowing that the obligee should have been PVB and not any other creditor with which GSIS had no interest in.<br><br>All these demonstrate Valencerina’s conscious doing of a wrong. It was, thus, proven beyond reasonable doubt that he acted in bad faith by making significant and unjustified contributions to the issuance of an irregular bond and giving undue advantage to Ecobel which could have cost millions of dollars to GSIS and the government.<br><br>In a last ditch attempt to save himself, Valencerina argues that the documents, especially the above certifications from which the testimonies of the witnesses and eventually his conviction were based, could not be used as evidence against him for being incompetent and hearsay as they were mere photocopies that were not properly authenticated.<br><br>Indeed, these documents serve as the bedrock of the prosecution’s position that he violated Sec. 3(e) of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.

He himself built upon the said documents to draw his defense that the certifications were mere statements of facts and procedures. He did not contradict their existence but even went further to elaborate as to the reasons behind their issuance. As such, the Court cannot give merit to his position that, being mere photocopies, the certifications could not be relied on in determining his culpability. Conversely, the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, assuming they had no personal knowledge of the contents and due execution of the said documents, would now be a superfluity as he himself used the certifications to forward his defense.<br><br>The Court finds no value either to Valencerina’s submission that no crime was proven to have been committed because no evidence had been presented showing that BSIL actually granted a loan of US $10 million to Ecobel, it being the corpus delicti of the second mode of committing the offense under Sec. 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019. The reason is simple. The <i>corpus delicti</i> of the crime is not dependent upon whether a loan had been granted to Ecobel, but more on proving the fact of giving unwarranted preference or benefit to another with evident bad faith, manifest partiality or gross inexcusable negligence. It is sufficient that such fact has been established, as the prosecution did in this case.<br><br>Besides, the Court gives credence to the report and findings of the audit investigation team, affirmed by the Sandiganbayan, that Ecobel failed to pay the loan from BSIL, which then gave rise to a notice making known the decision of the assignee under the loan to collect on the surety bond subject of this case. This by itself cemented the fact that, indeed, Ecobel received benefit by reason of the unjustified actions committed by no less than the high-ranking officers of GSIS.<br><br>Furthermore, Valencerina’s contention that his constitutional right was violated because he was not validly charged with violation of Sec. 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 deserves no consideration. It is his theory that his right to be informed of the crime he committed was violated as the Sandiganbayan convicted him for giving undue advantage to Ecobel (second mode), which was contrary to the crime as alleged in the information - that he caused undue injury to the government by participating in the issuance of the subject bond (first mode).<br><br>The Court cannot agree. There are two ways by which Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 may be violated – first by causing undue injury to any party, including the government and second, by giving any private party any unwarranted benefit, advantage or preference. Although neither mode constitutes a distinct offense, an accused may be charged under either mode or both. In the amended information, the prosecution charged him for both. A perusal of the same simply yields no other conclusion that Valencerina, together with the other accused, was charged with violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 for “<i>[w]ilfully, unlawfully and criminally, with evident bad faith and manifest partiality, participat[ing], or contribut[ing] to, the release or issuance of Surety Bond GIF NO. 029132 xxxx hereby affording unwarranted benefit, advantage or preference to Ecobel Land Incorporated</i>.”<br><br>In the same breath, the Court dismisses or cannot allow the petitioner’s defense that no action, criminal or civil, arises because the bond in itself was null and void. The subject bond’s nullity was precisely brought about by his actions and had he not acted the way he did, this would not even have existed. Suffice it to state that to exculpate him from liability just because the bond cannot be made effective is to justify his wrongdoings, which the Court cannot allow.<br><br>Finally, Valencerina’s act of cancelling the bond upon information that the collateral submitted was spurious does not negate the fact that at the time that the bond was issued as well as during the process of negotiating for the loan using the same bond, the act of giving undue preference to Ecobel already existed. Indeed, the cancellation was merely an afterthought as he did the same only when the irregularities had become too apparent that they could no longer be overlooked.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Carpio, (Chairperson), Velasco, Jr.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> Villarama, Jr.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">**</sup> and <i>Leonen, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><hr width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> Designated Additional Member in lieu of Associate Justice Mariano C.
