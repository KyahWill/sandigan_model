Considering its previous payments in the total amount of P10,814,382.26, COJCOLDS was then ordered to pay BTL the unpaid balance of <b>P1,612,017.74</b>, as well as the costs of the additional works made on the Medina Project, particularly, P804,460.89<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> for the concrete retaining wall, and P344,360.16 for the unpaid balances from the works done under Change Order Nos. 8 to 12.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> On the other hand, BTL was ordered to pay COJCOLDS liquidated damages at the rate of P12,680.00 per day, or a total of P1,191,920.00, pursuant to Article 3(B) of the Contract as well as Article 29.04 of the General Conditions, due to the former’s 94-day delay, notwithstanding several extensions (238 days in total).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Dissatisfied with the CIAC’s ruling, COJCOLDS elevated the matter to the CA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br><b><center>The CA Ruling</center></b><br>In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> dated August 15, 2006, the CA modified the CIAC’s ruling in that it ordered COJCOLDS not only to pay BTL the amount of P1,612,017.74 representing the unpaid portion of 98% of the contract price, but also to return to BTL the 10% retention money in the amount of P1,248,179.87, after deducting the cost overrun of P526,400.00 that BTL was held to shoulder as per Article 3(E) of the Contract<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> (under which COJCOLDS was allowed to engage the services of another contractor, <i>i.e.</i>, Vigor, to complete the Medina Project using the 10% retention amount).<br><br>Meanwhile, the CA ordered BTL to return to COJCOLDS the amount of P300,533.49 which was found to be an overpayment made by the latter pursuant to the change orders.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>The CA also increased the award of liquidated damages in COJCOLDS’s favor from P1,191,920.00 to P1,800,560.00 since BTL was actually in delay for 142 days (and not 94 days as found by the CIAC). The CA clarified that pursuant to Article 21.04(A) of the General Conditions as well as the practice in the construction industry, the architect’s recommendation regarding the grant of extensions should be controlling and thus BTL was only given an extension of 190 days (and not 238 days as found by the CIAC).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Further, the CA deleted the awards for the additional works (<i>i.e.</i>, P804,460.89 for the concrete retaining wall, and P344,360.16 for the unpaid balances from the works taken under Change Order Nos. 8 to 12) adjudged by the CIAC in favor of COJCOLDS because: (<i>a</i>) the retaining wall should be properly deemed as part of the original works, considering that it was not covered by any change order, unlike the other additional works performed on the Medina Project; and (<i>b</i>) there is no basis in saying that COJCOLDS failed to pay the balance for the works taken under Change Order Nos. 8 to 12, considering that COJCOLDS paid such balance directly to BTL’s suppliers, pursuant to BTL’s May 18, 2001 request to COJCOLDS.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Finally, the CA deleted the award of attorney’s fees in BTL’s favor as COJCOLDS was not in bad faith in refusing to pay the former’s claims.<br><br>Dissatisfied, both parties moved for reconsideration, which were, however, denied in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> dated January 26, 2007, hence, these petitions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Issues Before the Court</b></center><br>The issues raised for the Court’s resolution are as follows: (<i>a</i>) whether or not the 10% retention money that COJCOLDS was ordered to release in favor of BTL is separate and distinct from the unpaid balance of the contract price amounting to P1,612,017.74; (<i>b</i>) whether or not COJCOLDS is liable for the “additional works” performed by BTL, specifically the concrete retaining wall and the works taken under Change Order Nos. 8 to 12; (<i>c</i>) whether or not BTL incurred delay in its obligation to complete the Medina Project and thus, must pay COJCOLDS liquidated damages at the rate of P12,680.00 for every day of delay; (<i>d</i>) whether or not BTL is liable to pay COJCOLDS the value of cost overrun in the amount of P526,400.00; (<i>e</i>) whether or not BTL received overpayments in the change orders from COJCOLDS amounting to P300,533.49 and thus, should be held liable to return the same; and (<i>f</i>) whether or not the parties are liable to pay each other’s attorney’s fees, arbitration costs, and costs of suit.<br><br><center><b>The Court’s Ruling</b></center><br>COJCOLDS’s petition in G.R.

Liabilities of COJCOLDS to BTL.<br></b><blockquote><ol type="a"><li><b>The 10% Retention Money and the Unpaid Balance of the Contract Price.</b><br></li></ol></blockquote><br>In its petition, COJCOLDS concedes that it has yet to pay BTL the unpaid balance of the contract price amounting to P1,612,017.74 and that it has withheld the 10% retention money in the amount of P1,248,179.87 which should be returned to BTL. It, however, argues that the CA erred in ruling that the retention money should be paid <b>in addition</b> to the unpaid balance of the contract price. COJCOLDS contends that treating the retention money as a separate and distinct liability from the unpaid balance would unduly increase its total liability from the Medina Project (including the amount of P10,814,382.26 which it had already paid to BTL) from P12,426,400.00 to P13,674,579.87.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>The Court agrees with COJCOLDS.<br><br>In <i>H.L. Carlos Construction, Inc. v. Marina Properties Corp.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> the Court held that in the construction industry, the 10% retention money<b> is a portion of the contract price automatically deducted from the contractor’s billings, as security for the execution of corrective work</b> – if any – becomes necessary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Articles 3(E) and 5 of the Contract and Article 22.14 of the General Conditions govern the application of the 10% retention money in these cases, viz.:<br><br><blockquote><center><b>CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT</b></center><br>x x x x<br><br><b>ARTICLE 3. TIME AND COMPLETION AND SCHEDULE OF CONSTRUCTION</b><br><br>x x x x<br><br><ol start="5" type="A"><li>The CONTRACTOR’S TEN (10) percent retention under Article V hereof shall be retained by the OWNER until all items on the Substantial Inspection are satisfactorily completed and accepted by the OWNER.

As such, the 10% retention money <b>should not be treated as a separate and distinct liability</b> of COJCOLDS to BTL as it merely forms part of the contract price. While COJCOLDS is bound to eventually return to BTL the amount of P1,248,179.87 as retention money, the said amount should be automatically deducted from BTL’s outstanding billings. Ultimately, COJCOLDS’s total liability to BTL should only be pegged at <b>P1,612,017.74</b>, representing the unpaid balance of 98% of the contract price, <b>inclusive</b> of the 10% retention money.<br><br><b><ol start="2" type="a"><li>Costs of Additional Works: Price of the<br>Concrete Retaining Wall and the Works Under<br>Change Order Nos. 8 to 12.</li></ol></b>BTL claims that the construction of the concrete retaining wall was not part of the original plans of the Contract and that there was evident bad faith on the part of COJCOLDS’s architect when he inserted the plan on the concrete retaining wall sometime after the contract signing of the parties to make it appear as part of the original plans in order to cover up for his oversight.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>BTL’s claim is untenable.<br><br>Article 1724<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> of the Civil Code governs the recovery of additional costs in contracts for a stipulated price (such as fixed lump-sum contracts), as well as the increase in price for any additional work due to a subsequent change in the original plans and specifications. Based on the same provision, such added costs can only be allowed upon the: (<i>a</i>) written authority from the developer or project owner ordering or allowing the written changes in work; and (<i>b</i>) written agreement of parties with regard to the increase in price or cost due to the change in work or design modification. Case law instructs that compliance with these two (2) requisites is a <b>condition precedent for recovery</b>. The absence of one or the other condition thus bars the claim of additional costs. Notably, neither the authority for the changes made nor the additional price to be paid therefor may be proved by any evidence other than the written authority and agreement as above-mentioned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>In these cases, records reveal that there is neither a written authorization nor agreement covering the additional price to be paid for the concrete retaining wall. This confirms the CA’s finding that the construction of the perimeter wall of the Medina Project, which is included in the <b>original</b> plans and specifications for the same, <b>already subsumes</b> the construction of the concrete retaining wall.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Accordingly, COJCOLDS should not pay the amount of P804,460.89 claimed by BTL as additional cost for the same.<br><br>In similar regard, the COJCOLDS should not be held liable for the costs of the additional works taken under Change Order Nos. 8 to 12 amounting to P344,360.16 as claimed by BTL. As correctly observed by the CA, BTL had, in fact, requested COJCOLDS to make the payments therefor directly to its suppliers in view of its financial losses in another project.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Hence, considering that COJCOLDS’s payment to BTL’s suppliers <b>already covered</b> the costs of said additional works upon its own request and to its own credit,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> BTL maintains no right to pursue such claim.<br><br>With BTL’s claims for the costs of additional works herein denied, COJCOLDS’s total liability to BTL thus stands in the amount of <b>P1,612,017.74</b>, which represents the unpaid balance of 98% of the contract price, inclusive of the 10% retention money, as previously stated.<br><br>Having resolved the foregoing issues, the Court now proceeds to determine BTL’s liabilities to COJCOLDS.<br><b><br>II. Liabilities of BTL to COJCOLDS.</b><br><b><ol type="a"><li>Liquidated Damages Due to Delay.</li></ol></b><br>BTL’s liability to COJCOLDS for liquidated damages is a result of its delay in the performance of its obligations under the Contract. While the fact of BTL’s delay has not been seriously disputed in these cases, the Court must, however, resolve the extent of such delay in view of the conflicting findings of the CIAC and the CA on the matter.<br><br>In these cases, records reveal that BTL sought for a 304-day extension of the original completion deadline of September 15, 2000, broken down as follows: (<i>a</i>) 184 days as per Change Order Nos. 1 to 6;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>&nbsp; and (<i>b</i>) 120 days as per Change Order Nos. 8 to 12.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> However, the architect only recommended that COJCOLDS should only grant BTL extensions of 160 days for the works to be done under Change Order Nos. 1 to 6 and 30 days for Change Order Nos. 8 to 12, or a total of 190 days. Since Article 21.04<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> of the General Conditions <b>expressly recognizes that the architect’s recommendations regarding extensions of time should be controlling</b>, the Court upholds the CA’s finding that BTL was only granted a 190-day extension (from the original completion deadline) to finish the Medina Project, or until March 24, 2001. Despite such extension, BTL nevertheless failed to complete the same. In fact, as the parties themselves admitted, the Medina Project was only 98% complete when the Contract was terminated. Based on the foregoing, the Court thus finds that BTL’s delay should be reckoned from March 25, 2001 (or the day after the above-stated 190-day extension) up until August 17, 2001 (or the day when the Contract was terminated), or a total of <b>146 days</b> (length of delay). Applying Article 3(B)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> of the Contract and Article 29.04<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> of the General Conditions, BTL is therefore liable to pay COJCOLDS liquidated damages in the amount of P12,680.00 multiplied by the length of delay, resulting in a total of P1,851,280.00<br><b><br><ol start="2" type="a"><li><b>Cost Overrun.</b></li></ol></b><br>Due to BTL’s delay which impelled COJCOLDS to terminate the Contract and subsequently hire the services of another contractor, <i>i.e.</i>, Vigor, to finish the Medina Project, the Court equally agrees with the CA’s finding that COJCOLDS incurred a cost overrun of <b>P526,400.00</b>. Conformably with Article 3(E)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> of the Contract and Article 29.04<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> of the General Conditions, BTL should therefore reimburse COJCOLDS the said cost which the latter incurred essentially because of BTL’s failure to complete the project as agreed upon.<br><b><ol start="3" type="a"><li>Overpayments.</li></ol></b>Based on the records, BTL charged COJCOLDS the amount of P1,014,469.79 for the modifications introduced to the Medina Project as indicated in Change Order Nos. 1 to 12.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> In turn, COJCOLDS paid BTL the amount of P651,727.91<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> for the modifications covered by Change Order Nos. 1 to 7 and no longer paid for those covered by Change Order Nos. 8 to 12 because, as discussed earlier, COJCOLDS diverted such payments directly to BTL’s suppliers upon its own request and to its own credit. Accordingly, COJCOLDS paid P663,275.37 to these suppliers, resulting in COJCOLDS actually paying a total of P1,315,003.28 for the works taken under Change Order Nos. 1 to 12.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> This means that BTL was effectively overpaid the amount of <b>P300,533.49</b>, and is therefore obliged to return the same to COJCOLDS pursuant to Article 2154 of the Civil Code which states that “[i]f something is received when there is no right to demand it, and it was unduly delivered through mistake, the obligation to return it arises.”<br><br>To recapitulate, the Court sustains the following liabilities of BTL to COJCOLDS: (<i>a</i>) P1,851,280.00 as liquidated damages; (<i>b</i>) P526,400.00 as cost overrun; and (<i>c</i>) P300,533.49 as overpayment under Change Order Nos. 1 to 12.<br><br><b>III. Mutual Liabilities: Attorney’s Fees, <br>Arbitration Costs, and Costs of Suit.</b><br><br>The general rule is that attorney’s fees cannot be recovered as part of damages because of the policy that no premium should be placed on the right to litigate. They are not to be awarded every time a party wins a suit. The power of the court to award attorney’s fees under Article 2208<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> of the Civil Code demands factual, legal, and equitable justification. Even when a claimant is compelled to litigate with third persons or to incur expenses to protect his rights, still <b>attorney’s fees may not be awarded where no sufficient showing of bad faith could be reflected in a party’s persistence in a case other than an erroneous conviction of the righteousness of his cause.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>In these cases, the Court observes that neither party was shown to have acted in bad faith in pursuing their respective claims against each other. The existence of bad faith is negated by the fact that the CIAC, the CA, and the Court have all found the parties’ original claims to be partially meritorious. Thus, absent no cogent reason to hold otherwise, the Court deems it inappropriate to award attorney’s fees in favor of either party.<br><br>Finally, in view of their legitimate claims against each other, each party should bear its own arbitration costs and costs of suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition in G.R.
