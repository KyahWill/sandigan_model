				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"><blockquote><i>Freedom of religion was accorded preferred status by the framers of our fundamental law. And this Court has consistently affirmed this preferred status, well aware that it is "designed to protect the broadest possible liberty of conscience, to allow each man to believe as his conscience directs, to profess his beliefs, and to live as he believes he ought to live, consistent with the liberty of others and with the common good."</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br></blockquote><br>To this day, poverty is still a major stumbling block to the nation’s emergence as a developed country, leaving our people beleaguered in a state of hunger, illiteracy and unemployment. While governmental policies have been geared towards the revitalization of the economy, the bludgeoning dearth in social services remains to be a problem that concerns not only the poor, but every member of society. The government continues to tread on a trying path to the realization of its very purpose, that is, the general welfare of the Filipino people and the development of the country as a whole. The legislative branch, as the main facet of a representative government, endeavors to enact laws and policies that aim to remedy looming societal woes, while the executive is closed set to fully implement these measures and bring concrete and substantial solutions within the reach of Juan dela Cruz. Seemingly distant is the judicial branch, oftentimes regarded as an inert governmental body that merely casts its watchful eyes on clashing stakeholders until it is called upon to adjudicate. Passive, yet reflexive when called into action, the Judiciary then willingly embarks on its solemn duty to interpret legislation vis-à-vis the most vital and enduring principle that holds Philippine society together — the supremacy of the Philippine Constitution.<br><br>Nothing has polarized the nation more in recent years than the issues of population growth control, abortion and contraception. As in every democratic society, diametrically opposed views on the subjects and their perceived consequences freely circulate in various media. From television debates<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> to sticker campaigns,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> from rallies by socio-political activists to mass gatherings organized by members of the clergy<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> – the clash between the seemingly antithetical ideologies of the religious conservatives and progressive liberals has caused a deep division in every level of the society. Despite calls to withhold support thereto, however, Republic Act (<i>R.A.</i>) No. 10354, otherwise known as the Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012 (<i>RH Law</i>), was enacted by Congress on December 21, 2012.<br><br>Shortly after the President placed his <i>imprimatur</i> on the said law, challengers from various sectors of society came knocking on the doors of the Court, beckoning it to wield the sword that strikes down constitutional disobedience. Aware of the profound and lasting impact that its decision may produce, the Court now faces the<i> iuris controversy</i> as presented in fourteen (14) petitions and two (2) petitions- in-intervention, to wit: <br><br>(1) Petition for <i>Certiorari </i>and Prohibition,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> filed by spouses Attys.

According to the petitioners, notwithstanding its declared policy against abortion, the implementation of the RH Law would authorize the purchase of hormonal contraceptives, intra-uterine devices and injectables which are abortives, in violation of Section 12, Article II of the Constitution which guarantees protection of both the life of the mother and the life of the unborn from conception.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></li><li>The RH Law violates the <b><u>right to health</u></b> and the <b><u>right to protection against hazardous products</u></b>. The petitioners posit that the RH Law provides universal access to contraceptives which are hazardous to one’s health, as it causes cancer and other health problems.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></li><li>The RH Law violates the <b><u>right to religious freedom</u></b>. The petitioners contend that the RH Law violates the constitutional guarantee respecting religion as it authorizes the use of public funds for the procurement of contraceptives. For the petitioners, the use of public funds for purposes that are believed to be contrary to their beliefs is included in the constitutional mandate ensuring religious freedom.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></li></ul><br>It is also contended that the RH Law threatens conscientious objectors of criminal prosecution, imprisonment and other forms of punishment, as it compels <i>medical practitioners</i> 1] to refer patients who seek advice on reproductive health programs to other doctors; and 2] to provide full and correct information on reproductive health programs and service, although it is against their religious beliefs and convictions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>In this connection, Section 5.23 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the RH Law (<i>RH-IRR</i>),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> provides that <b>skilled health professionals who are public officers</b> such as, but not limited to, Provincial, City, or Municipal Health Officers, medical officers, medical specialists, rural health physicians, hospital staff nurses, public health nurses, or rural health midwives, who are specifically charged with the duty to implement these Rules, <b>cannot be considered as conscientious objectors.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>It is also argued that the RH Law providing for the formulation of <b>mandatory sex education</b> in schools should not be allowed as it is an affront to their religious beliefs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>While the petitioners recognize that the guarantee of religious freedom is not absolute, they argue that the RH Law fails to satisfy the “<b>clear and present danger test</b>” and the “<b>compelling state interest test</b>” to justify the regulation of the right to free exercise of religion and the right to free speech.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><ul><li>The RH Law violates the constitutional provision on <b><u>involuntary servitude</u></b>. According to the petitioners, the RH Law subjects <i>medical practitioners</i> to involuntary servitude because, to be accredited under the PhilHealth program, they are compelled to provide forty-eight (48) hours of <i>pro bono</i> services for indigent women, under threat of criminal prosecution, imprisonment and other forms of punishment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>The petitioners explain that since a majority of patients are covered by PhilHealth, a medical practitioner would effectively be forced to render reproductive health services since the lack of PhilHealth accreditation would mean that the majority of the public would no longer be able to avail of the practitioners’ services.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]<br><br></sup></li><li>The RH Law violates the right to equal protection of the law. It is claimed that the RH Law discriminates against the poor as it makes them the primary target of the government program that promotes contraceptive use. The petitioners argue that, rather than promoting reproductive health among the poor, the RH Law seeks to introduce contraceptives that would effectively reduce the number of the poor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]<br><br></sup></li><li>The RH Law is “void-for-vagueness” in violation of the due process clause of the Constitution. In imposing the penalty of imprisonment and/or fine for “any violation,” it is vague because it does not define the type of conduct to be treated as “violation” of the RH Law. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></li></ul>In this connection, it is claimed that “Section 7 of the RH Law violates the right to due process by removing from them (the people) the right to manage their own affairs and to decide what kind of health facility they shall be and what kind of services they shall offer.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> It ignores the management prerogative inherent in corporations for employers to conduct their affairs in accordance with their own discretion and judgment.<br><br><ul><li>The RH Law violates the <b><u>right to free speech</u></b>. To compel a person to explain a full range of family planning methods is plainly to curtail his right to expound only his own preferred way of family planning. The petitioners note that although exemption is granted to institutions owned and operated by religious groups, they are still forced to refer their patients to another healthcare facility willing to perform the service or procedure.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]<br><br></sup></li><li>The RH Law intrudes into the <b><u>zone of privacy of one’s family</u></b> protected by the Constitution. It is contended that the RH Law providing for mandatory reproductive health education intrudes upon their constitutional right to raise their children in accordance with their beliefs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></li></ul><br>It is claimed that, by giving absolute authority to the person who will undergo reproductive health procedure, the RH Law forsakes any real dialogue between the spouses and impedes the right of spouses to mutually decide on matters pertaining to the overall well-being of their family. In the same breath, it is also claimed that the parents of a child who has suffered a miscarriage are deprived of parental authority to determine whether their child should use contraceptives.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br><ul><li>The RH Law violates the constitutional principle of non-delegation of legislative authority. The petitioners question the delegation by Congress to the FDA of the power to determine whether a product is non-abortifacient and to be included in the Emergency Drugs List (<i>EDL</i>).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></li><li>The RH Law violates the <b><u>one subject/one bill</u></b> rule provision under Section 26(1), Article VI of the Constitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></li><li>The RH Law violates <b><u>Natural Law</u></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></li><li>The RH Law violates the principle of <b>Autonomy of Local Government Units</b> (<i>LGUs</i>) and the <b>Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao</b> (<i>ARMM</i>). It is contended that the RH Law, providing for reproductive health measures at the local government level and the ARMM, infringes upon the powers devolved to LGUs and the ARMM under the Local Government Code and R.A. No. 9054.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></li></ul></blockquote><br>Various parties also sought and were granted leave to file their respective comments-in-intervention in defense of the constitutionality of the RH Law.

To be clear, the separation of powers is a fundamental principle in our system of government, which obtains not through express provision but by actual division in our Constitution. Each department of the government has exclusive cognizance of matters within its jurisdiction and is supreme within its own sphere.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> Thus, the 1987 Constitution provides that: (a) the legislative power shall be vested in the Congress of the Philippines;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> (b) the executive power shall be vested in the President of the Philippines;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> and (c) the judicial power shall be vested in one Supreme Court and in such lower courts as may be established by law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> The Constitution has truly blocked out with deft strokes and in bold lines, the allotment of powers among the three branches of government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br><br>In its relationship with its co-equals, the Judiciary recognizes the doctrine of separation of powers which imposes upon the courts proper restraint, born of the nature of their functions and of their respect for the other branches of government, in striking down the acts of the Executive or the Legislature as unconstitutional.

The reason is simple and goes back to the earlier point. The Court may pass upon the constitutionality of acts of the legislative and the executive branches, since its duty is not to review their collective wisdom but, rather, to make sure that they have acted in consonance with their respective authorities and rights as mandated of them by the Constitution. If after said review, the Court finds no constitutional violations of any sort, then, it has no more authority of proscribing the actions under review.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> This is in line with Article VIII, Section 1 of the Constitution which expressly provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 1.

The duty (to adjudicate) remains to assure that the supremacy of the Constitution is upheld.” Once a “controversy as to the application or interpretation of constitutional provision is raised before this Court (as in the instant case), it becomes a legal issue which the Court is bound by constitutional mandate to decide.

The rule on <i>locus standi</i> is, after all, a procedural technicality which the Court has, on more than one occasion, waived or relaxed, thus allowing non-traditional plaintiffs, such as concerned citizens, taxpayers, voters or legislators, to sue in the public interest, albeit they may not have been directly injured by the operation of a law or any other government act.

As stated earlier, the RH Law emphasizes the need to provide Filipinos, especially the poor and the marginalized, with access to information on the full range of modern family planning products and methods.

This is undisputable because before conception, there is no unborn to speak of. For said reason, it is no surprise that the Constitution is mute as to any proscription prior to conception or when life begins.

As much as possible, the words of the Constitution should be understood in the sense they have in common use. What it says according to the text of the provision to be construed compels acceptance and negates the power of the courts to alter it, based on the postulate that the framers and the people mean what they say. <i>Verba legis non est recedendum</i> – from the words of a statute there should be no departure.<br><br>The raison d’ être for the rule is essentially two-fold: First, because it is assumed that the words in which constitutional provisions are couched express the objective sought to be attained; and second, because the Constitution is not primarily a lawyer’s document but essentially that of the people, in whose consciousness it should ever be present as an important condition for the rule of law to prevail.</blockquote><br>In conformity with the above principle, the traditional meaning of the word “conception” which, as described and defined by all reliable and reputable sources, means that life begins at fertilization.<br><br>Webster's Third New International Dictionary describes it as the act of becoming pregnant, formation of a viable zygote; the fertilization that results in a new entity capable of developing into a being like its parents.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[145]</sup><br><br>Black’s Law Dictionary gives legal meaning to the term “conception” as the fecundation of the female ovum by the male spermatozoon <i>resulting in human life</i> capable of survival and maturation under normal conditions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[146]</sup><br><br>Even in jurisprudence, an unborn child has already a legal personality.

From their deliberations, it clearly refers to the moment of “fertilization.” The records reflect the following:<br><br><blockquote><b>Rev. Rigos</b>: In Section 9, page 3, there is a sentence which reads:<br><blockquote>“The State shall equally protect the life of the mother and the life of the unborn from the moment of conception.”<br><br>When is the moment of conception?<br><br>xxx<br></blockquote><b>Mr. Villegas</b>: As I explained in the sponsorship speech, it is <b>when the ovum is fertilized by the sperm that there is human life</b>. x x x.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[150]</sup><br><br>xxx<br></blockquote><br>As to why conception is reckoned from fertilization and, as such, the beginning of human life, it was explained:<br><br><blockquote><b>Mr. Villegas</b>: I propose to review this issue in a biological manner. The first question that needs to be answered is: Is the fertilized ovum alive? Biologically categorically says yes, the fertilized ovum is alive. First of all, like all living organisms, it takes in nutrients which it processes by itself. It begins doing this upon fertilization. Secondly, as it takes in these nutrients, it grows from within. Thirdly, it multiplies itself at a geometric rate in the continuous process of cell division. All these processes are vital signs of life. Therefore, there is no question that biologically the fertilized ovum has life.<br><br>The second question: Is it human? Genetics gives an equally categorical “yes.” At the moment of conception, the nuclei of the ovum and the sperm rupture. As this happens 23 chromosomes from the ovum combine with 23 chromosomes of the sperm to form a total of 46 chromosomes. A chromosome count of 46 is found only – and I repeat, only in human cells. Therefore, the fertilized ovum is human.<br><br>Since these questions have been answered affirmatively, we must conclude that if the fertilized ovum is both alive and human, then, as night follows day, it must be human life. Its nature is human.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[151]</sup></blockquote><br>Why the Constitution used the phrase “from the moment of conception” and not “from the moment of fertilization” was not because of doubt when human life begins, but rather, because:<br><br><blockquote><b>Mr. Tingson</b>: x x x x the phrase from the moment of conception” was described by us here before with the scientific phrase “fertilized ovum” may be beyond the comprehension of some people; we want to use the simpler phrase “from the moment of conception.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[152]</sup></blockquote><br>Thus, in order to ensure that the fertilized ovum is given ample protection under the Constitution, it was discussed:<br><br><blockquote><b>Rev. Rigos</b>: Yes, we think that the word “unborn” is sufficient for the purpose of writing a Constitution, without specifying “from the moment of conception.”<br><br><b>Mr. Davide</b>: I would not subscribe to that particular view because according to the Commissioner’s own admission, he would leave it to Congress to define when life begins. So, Congress can define life to begin from six months after fertilization; and that would really be very, very, dangerous. It is now determined by science that life begins from the moment of conception. There can be no doubt about it. So we should not give any doubt to Congress, too.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[153]</sup></blockquote><br>Upon further inquiry, it was asked:<br><br><blockquote><b>Mr. Gascon</b>: Mr. Presiding Officer, I would like to ask a question on that point. Actually, that is one of the questions I was going to raise during the period of interpellations but it has been expressed already. The provision, as proposed right now states:<br><blockquote>The State shall equally protect the life of the mother and the life of the unborn from the moment of conception.</blockquote><b>When it speaks of “from the moment of conception,” does this mean when the egg meets the sperm?</b><br><br><b>Mr. Villegas: Yes, the ovum is fertilized by the sperm.</b><br><br><b>Mr. Gascon</b>: Therefore that does not leave to Congress the right to determine whether certain contraceptives that we know today are abortifacient or not because it is a fact that some of the so-called contraceptives deter the rooting of the ovum in the uterus. If fertilization has already occurred, the next process is for the fertilized ovum to travel towards the uterus and to take root. <b>What happens with some contraceptives is that they stop the opportunity for the fertilized ovum to reach the uterus. Therefore, if we take the provision as it is proposed, these so called contraceptives should be banned.</b><br><br><b>Mr. Villegas:</b> Yes, if that physical fact is established, then that is what is called abortifacient and, therefore, would be unconstitutional and should be banned under this provision.<br><br><b>Mr. Gascon:</b> Yes. So my point is that I do not think it is up to Congress to state whether or not these certain contraceptives are abortifacient. Scientifically and based on the provision as it is now proposed, they are already considered abortifacient.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[154]</sup></blockquote><br>From the deliberations above-quoted, it is apparent that the Framers of the Constitution emphasized that the State shall provide equal protection to both the mother and the unborn child <b>from the earliest opportunity of life, </b>that is, <b>upon fertilization</b> or upon the union of the male sperm and the female ovum. It is also apparent is that the Framers of the Constitution intended that to prohibit Congress from enacting measures that would allow it determine when life begins.<br><br>Equally apparent, however, is that the Framers of the Constitution did not intend to ban all contraceptives for being unconstitutional. In fact, Commissioner Bernardo Villegas, spearheading the need to have a constitutional provision on the right to life, recognized that the determination of whether a contraceptive device is an abortifacient is a question of fact which should be left to the courts to decide on based on established evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[155]</sup> From the discussions above, contraceptives that kill or destroy the fertilized ovum should be deemed an abortive and thus prohibited. Conversely, contraceptives that actually prevent the union of the male sperm and the female ovum, and those that similarly take action <b><i>prior to fertilization</i></b> should be deemed non-abortive, and thus, constitutionally permissible.<br><br>As emphasized by the Framers of the Constitution:<br><br><blockquote><div align="center">xxx &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; xxx &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></div><br>Mr. Gascon: x x x x.

I would just like to be assured of the legal and pragmatic implications of the term “protection of the life of the unborn from the moment of conception.” I raised some of these implications this afternoon when I interjected in the interpellation of Commissioner Regalado. I would like to ask that question again for a categorical answer.<br><br>I mentioned that if we institutionalize the term “the life of the unborn from the moment of conception” we are also actually saying “no,” not “maybe,” to certain contraceptives which are already being encouraged at this point in time. Is that the sense of the committee or does it disagree with me?<br><br><b>Mr. Azcuna</b>: <b>No, Mr. Presiding Officer, because contraceptives would be preventive. There is no unborn yet. That is yet unshaped.</b><br><br><b>Mr. Gascon</b>: Yes, Mr. Presiding Officer, but I was speaking more about some contraceptives, such as the intra-uterine device which actually stops the egg which has already been fertilized from taking route to the uterus. So if we say “from the moment of conception,” what really occurs is that some of these contraceptives will have to be unconstitutionalized.<br><br><b>Mr. Azcuna</b>:<b> Yes, to the extent that it is after the fertilization.</b><br><br><b>Mr. Gascon</b>: Thank you, Mr. Presiding Officer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[156]</sup></blockquote><br>The fact that not all contraceptives are prohibited by the 1987 Constitution is even admitted by petitioners during the oral arguments.

Fertilization is a sequence of events that begins with the contact of a sperm (spermatozoon) with a secondary oocyte (ovum) and ends with the fusion of their pronuclei (the haploid nuclei of the sperm and ovum) and the mingling of their chromosomes to form a new cell.

It was so clear that <b>even the Court cannot interpret it otherwise.</b> This intent of the Framers was captured in the record of the proceedings of the 1986 Constitutional Commission. Commissioner Bernardo Villegas, the principal proponent of the protection of the unborn from conception, explained:<br><br><blockquote>The <b>intention</b>…is <b>to make sure</b> that there would be <b>no pro-abortion </b>laws ever passed <b>by Congress</b> or any pro-abortion decision passed by the <b>Supreme Court.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[169]</sup></blockquote><br>A reading of the RH Law would show that it is in line with this intent and actually proscribes abortion.

To be clear, Section 4(a) of the RH Law defines an abortifacient as:<br><br><blockquote>Section 4. <i>Definition of Terms </i>– x x x x<br><br>(a) <i>Abortifacient</i> refers to any drug or device that induces abortion or the destruction of a fetus inside the mother’s womb or the prevention of the fertilized ovum to reach and be implanted in the mother’s womb upon determination of the FDA.<br></blockquote><br>As stated above, the RH Law mandates that protection must be afforded from the moment of fertilization. By using the word “or,” the RH Law prohibits not only drugs or devices that prevent implantation, but also those that induce abortion and those that induce the destruction of a fetus inside the mother’s womb. Thus, an abortifacient is any drug or device that either:<br><br><blockquote>(a) <b>Induces abortion;</b> or<br>(b) Induces the destruction of a fetus inside the mother’s womb; or<br>(c) <b>Prevents the fertilized ovum to reach and be implanted in the mother’s womb</b>,<br></blockquote><br>upon determination of the FDA.<br><br>Contrary to the assertions made by the petitioners, the Court finds that the RH Law, consistent with the Constitution, <b>recognizes that the fertilized ovum already has life and that the State has a bounden duty to protect it.</b> The conclusion becomes clear because the RH Law, <b><i>first,</i></b> prohibits any drug or device that induces abortion (first kind), which, as discussed exhaustively above, refers to that which induces the killing or the destruction of the fertilized ovum, and, <b><i>second</i></b>, prohibits any drug or device the fertilized ovum to reach and be implanted in the mother’s womb (third kind).<br><br>By expressly declaring that any drug or device that prevents the fertilized ovum to reach and be implanted in the mother’s womb is an abortifacient (third kind), the RH Law does not intend to mean at all that life only begins only at implantation, as Hon. Lagman suggests. It also does not declare either that protection will only be given upon implantation, as the petitioners likewise suggest. <b>Rather, it recognizes that: <i><u>one</u></i>, there is a need to protect the fertilized ovum which already has life, and <b><u><i>two</i></u></b>, the fertilized ovum must be protected the moment it becomes existent – all the way until it reaches and implants in the mother’s womb</b>. After all, if life is only recognized and afforded protection from the moment the fertilized ovum implants – there is nothing to prevent any drug or device from killing or destroying the fertilized ovum prior to implantation.<br><br>From the foregoing, the Court finds that inasmuch as it affords protection to the fertilized ovum, the RH Law does not sanction abortion. To repeat, it is the Court’s position that life begins at fertilization, not at implantation. When a fertilized ovum is implanted in the uterine wall, its viability is sustained but that instance of implantation is not the point of beginning of life. It started earlier. And as defined by the RH Law, <b>any drug or device that induces abortion, that is, which kills or destroys the fertilized ovum or prevents the fertilized ovum to reach and be implanted in the mother’s womb, is an <u>abortifacient</u>.</b><br><br><i><b><u>Proviso Under Section 9 of the RH Law&nbsp; </u></b></i><br><br>This notwithstanding, the Court finds that the proviso under Section 9 of the law that “any product or supply included or to be included in the EDL must have a certification from the FDA that said product and supply is made available on the condition that <i>it is not to be used</i> as an abortifacient” as <b>empty as it is absurd</b>. The FDA, with all its expertise, cannot fully attest that a drug or device will not all be used as an abortifacient, since the agency cannot be present in every instance when the contraceptive product or supply will be used.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[171]</sup><br><br>Pursuant to its declared policy of providing access only to safe, legal and non-abortifacient contraceptives, however, the Court finds that the proviso of Section 9, as worded, should bend to the legislative intent and mean that “any product or supply included or to be included in the EDL must have a certification from the FDA that said product and supply is made available on the condition that<i> it cannot</i> be used as abortifacient.” Such a construction is consistent with the proviso under the second paragraph of the same section that provides:<br><br><blockquote><i>Provided, further,</i> That the foregoing offices shall not purchase or acquire by any means emergency contraceptive pills, postcoital pills, abortifacients that will be used for such purpose and their other forms or equivalent.<br></blockquote><br><i><u>Abortifacients under the RH-IRR</u></i><br><br>At this juncture, the Court agrees with ALFI that the authors of the RH-IRR gravely abused their office when they redefined the meaning of abortifacient. The RH Law defines “abortifacient” as follows:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 4. Definition of Terms. – For the purpose of this Act, the following terms shall be defined as follows:<br><br><blockquote>(a) Abortifacient refers to any drug or device that induces abortion or the destruction of a fetus inside the mother’s womb or the prevention of the fertilized ovum to reach and be implanted in the mother’s womb upon determination of the FDA.</blockquote></blockquote><br>Section 3.01(a) of the IRR, however, redefines “abortifacient” as:<br><br><blockquote>Section 3.01 For purposes of these Rules, the terms shall be defined as follows:<br><blockquote>a) Abortifacient refers to any drug or device that <b>primarily</b> induces abortion or the destruction of a fetus inside the mother’s womb or the prevention of the fertilized ovum to reach and be implanted in the mother’s womb upon determination of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). [Emphasis supplied]<br><br></blockquote></blockquote>Again in Section 3.01(j) of the RH-IRR, “contraceptive,” is redefined, <i>viz:</i><br><br><blockquote>j) <i>Contraceptive </i>refers to any safe, legal, effective and scientifically proven modern family planning method, device, or health product, whether natural or artificial, that prevents pregnancy but does not <b>primarily</b> destroy a fertilized ovum or prevent a fertilized ovum from being implanted in the mother’s womb in doses of its approved indication as determined by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</blockquote><br>The above-mentioned section of the RH-IRR allows “contraceptives” and recognizes as “abortifacient” only those that <b><i>primarily</i></b> induce abortion or the destruction of a fetus inside the mother’s womb or the prevention of the fertilized ovum to reach and be implanted in the mother’s womb.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[172]</sup><br><br>This cannot be done.<br><br>In this regard, the observations of Justice Brion and Justice Del Castillo are well taken. As they pointed out, with the insertion of the word “primarily,” Section 3.01(a) and (j) of the RH-IRR<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[173]</sup> must be struck down for being <i>ultra vires</i>.<br><br>Evidently, the addition of the word “primarily,” in Section 3.01(a) and (j) of the RH-IRR is indeed <i>ultra vires</i>. It contravenes Section 4(a) of the RH Law and should, therefore, be declared invalid. There is danger that the insertion of the qualifier “primarily” will pave the way for the approval of contraceptives which may harm or destroy the life of the unborn from conception/fertilization in violation of Article II, Section 12 of the Constitution. With such qualification in the RH-IRR, it appears to insinuate that a contraceptive will only be considered as an “abortifacient” if its sole known effect is abortion or, as pertinent here, the prevention of the implantation of the fertilized ovum.<br><br>For the same reason, this definition of “contraceptive” would permit the approval of contraceptives which are actually abortifacients because of their fail-safe mechanism.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[174]</sup><br><br>Also, as discussed earlier, Section 9 calls for the certification by the FDA that these contraceptives cannot act as abortive. With this, together with the definition of an abortifacient under Section 4 (a) of the RH Law and its declared policy against abortion, the undeniable conclusion is that contraceptives to be included in the PNDFS and the EDL will not only be those contraceptives that do not have the<b><i> primary action</i></b> of causing abortion or the destruction of a fetus inside the mother’s womb or the prevention of the fertilized ovum to reach and be implanted in the mother’s womb, but also those that do not have the <b><i>secondary action</i></b> of acting the same way.<br><br>Indeed, consistent with the constitutional policy prohibiting abortion, and in line with the principle that laws should be construed in a manner that its constitutionality is sustained, the RH Law and its implementing rules must be consistent with each other in prohibiting abortion. Thus, the word “primarily” in Section 3.01(a) and (j) of the RH-IRR should be declared void. To uphold the validity of Section 3.01(a) and (j) of the RH-IRR and prohibit only those contraceptives that have the primary effect of being an abortive would effectively “open the floodgates to the approval of contraceptives which may harm or destroy the life of the unborn from conception/fertilization in violation of Article II, Section 12 of the Constitution.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[175]</sup><br><br>To repeat and emphasize, in all cases, the “principle of no abortion” embodied in the constitutional protection of life must be upheld.<br><br><center><b><u>2-The Right to Health</u></b></center><br>The petitioners claim that the RH Law violates the right to health because it requires the inclusion of hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine devices, injectables and family products and supplies in the National Drug Formulary and the inclusion of the same in the regular purchase of essential medicines and supplies of all national hospitals.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[176]</sup> Citing various studies on the matter, the petitioners posit that the risk of developing <b>breast and cervical cancer</b> is greatly increased in women who use oral contraceptives as compared to women who never use them.

In this regard, the Constitution is replete with provisions protecting and promoting the right to health. Section 15, Article II of the Constitution provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 15. The State shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them.</blockquote><br>A portion of Article XIII also specifically provides for the States’ duty to provide for the health of the people, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote><center>HEALTH<br></center><br>Section 11.

The State shall protect consumers from trade malpractices and from substandard or hazardous products.</blockquote><br>Contrary to the respondent’s notion, however, these provisions are self-executing. Unless the provisions clearly express the contrary, the provisions of the Constitution should be considered self-executory. There is no need for legislation to implement these self-executing provisions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[182]</sup> In <i>Manila Prince Hotel v.

No. 5921 and R.A. No. 4729, the sale and distribution of contraceptives are not prohibited when they are dispensed by a prescription of a duly licensed by a physician – be maintained.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[185]</sup><br><br>The legislative intent in the enactment of the RH Law in this regard is to leave intact the provisions of R.A. No. 4729. There is no intention at all to do away with it. It is still a good law and its requirements are still in to be complied with. Thus, the Court agrees with the observation of respondent Lagman that the effectivity of the RH Law will not lead to the unmitigated proliferation of contraceptives since the sale, distribution and dispensation of contraceptive drugs and devices will still require the prescription of a licensed physician. With R.A. No. 4729 in place,<b> there exists adequate safeguards to ensure the public that only contraceptives that are safe are made available to the public</b>. As aptly explained by respondent Lagman:<br><br><blockquote><center><b>D. Contraceptives cannot be<br>dispensed and used without<br>prescription</b><br></center><br>108. As an added protection to voluntary users of contraceptives, the same cannot be dispensed and used without prescription.<br><br>109. Republic Act No. 4729 or “An Act to Regulate the Sale, Dispensation, and/or Distribution of Contraceptive Drugs and Devices” and Republic Act No. 5921 or “An Act Regulating the Practice of Pharmacy and Setting Standards of Pharmaceutical Education in the Philippines and for Other Purposes” are <b>not repealed</b> by the RH Law and the provisions of said Acts are <b>not inconsistent</b> with the RH Law.<br><br>110. Consequently, the sale, distribution and dispensation of contraceptive drugs and devices are particularly governed by RA No. 4729 which provides in full:<br><br><blockquote>“Section 1. It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, or corporation, to sell, dispense or otherwise distribute whether for or without consideration, any contraceptive drug or device, unless such sale, dispensation or distribution <u>is by a duly licensed drug store or pharmaceutical company and with the prescription of a qualified medical practitioner.</u><br><br>“Sec. 2. For the purpose of this Act:<br><br>“(a) “Contraceptive drug” is any medicine, drug, chemical, or portion which is used exclusively for the purpose of preventing fertilization of the female ovum: and<br><br>“(b) “Contraceptive device” is any instrument, device, material, or agent introduced into the female reproductive system for the primary purpose of preventing conception.<br><br>“Sec. 3 Any person, partnership, or corporation, violating the provisions of this Act shall be punished with a fine of not more than five hundred pesos or an imprisonment of not less than six months or more than one year or both in the discretion of the Court.<br><br>“This Act shall take effect upon its approval.<br><br>“<b>Approved</b>: June 18, 1966”<br></blockquote><br>111. Of the same import, but in a general manner, Section 25 of RA No. 5921 provides:<br><br><blockquote>“<b>Section 25</b>. <i>Sale of medicine, pharmaceuticals, drugs and devices.</i> No medicine, pharmaceutical, or drug of whatever nature and kind or device shall be compounded, dispensed, sold or resold, or otherwise be made available to the consuming public except through a prescription drugstore or hospital pharmacy, duly established in accordance with the provisions of this Act.</blockquote><br><b>112. With all of the foregoing safeguards, as provided for in the RH Law and other relevant statutes, the pretension of the petitioners that the RH Law will lead to the unmitigated proliferation of contraceptives, whether harmful or not, is completely unwarranted and baseless.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[186]</sup> [Emphases in the Original.

The DOH shall coordinate with all appropriate local government bodies to plan and implement this procurement and distribution program.

No. 4729, which is still in effect, and ensure that the contraceptives that it will procure shall be from a duly licensed drug store or pharmaceutical company and that the actual dispensation of these contraceptive drugs and devices will done following a prescription of a qualified medical practitioner. The distribution of contraceptive drugs and devices must not be indiscriminately done. The public health must be protected by all possible means. As pointed out by Justice De Castro,<b> a heavy responsibility and burden is assumed by the government in supplying contraceptive drugs and devices, for it may be held accountable for any injury, illness or loss of life resulting or incidental to their use</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[187]</sup><br><br>At any rate, it bears pointing out that <b>not a single contraceptive has yet been submitted to the FDA pursuant to the RH Law</b>. It behooves the Court to await its determination which drugs or devices are declared by the FDA as safe, it being the agency tasked to ensure that food and medicines available to the public are safe for public consumption. Consequently, the Court finds that, at this point, the attack on the RH Law on this ground is <i><b>premature</b></i>. Indeed, the various kinds of contraceptives must first be measured up to the constitutional yardstick as expounded herein, to be determined as the case presents itself.<br><br>At this point, the Court is of the strong view that Congress cannot legislate that hormonal contraceptives and intra-uterine devices are safe and non-abortifacient. The first sentence of Section 9 that ordains their inclusion by the National Drug Formulary in the EDL by using the mandatory “shall” is to be construed as operative only after they have been tested, evaluated, and approved by the FDA. The FDA, not Congress, has the expertise to determine whether a particular hormonal contraceptive or intrauterine device is safe and non-abortifacient. The provision of the third sentence concerning the requirements for the inclusion or removal of a particular family planning supply from the EDL supports this construction.<br><br>Stated differently, the provision in Section 9 covering the inclusion of hormonal contraceptives, intra-uterine devices, injectables, and other safe, legal, non-abortifacient and effective family planning products and supplies by the National Drug Formulary in the EDL is not mandatory. There must first be a determination by the FDA that they are in fact safe, legal, non-abortifacient and effective family planning products and supplies. There can be no predetermination by Congress that the gamut of contraceptives are “safe, legal, non-abortifacient and effective” without the proper scientific examination.<br><br><center><b><u>3 -Freedom of Religion<br>and the Right to Free Speech</u></b></center><br><br><i><u>Position of the Petitioners:</u></i><br><br><i>1. <u>On Contraception</u></i><br><br>While contraceptives and procedures like vasectomy and tubal ligation are not covered by the constitutional proscription, there are those who, because of their religious education and background, sincerely believe that contraceptives, whether abortifacient or not, are evil. Some of these are medical practitioners who essentially claim that their beliefs prohibit not only the use of contraceptives but also the willing participation and cooperation in all things dealing with contraceptive use. Petitioner PAX explained that “contraception is gravely opposed to marital chastity, it is contrary to the good of the transmission of life, and to the reciprocal self-giving of the spouses; it harms true love and denies the sovereign rule of God in the transmission of Human life.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[188]</sup><br><br>The petitioners question the State-sponsored procurement of contraceptives, arguing that the expenditure of their taxes on contraceptives violates the guarantee of religious freedom since contraceptives contravene their religious beliefs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[189]</sup><br><br><i>2. <u>On Religious Accommodation and<br>The Duty to Refer</u></i><br><br>Petitioners Imbong and Luat note that while the RH Law attempts to address religious sentiments by making provisions for a conscientious objector, the constitutional guarantee is nonetheless violated because the law also imposes upon the conscientious objector the duty to refer the patient seeking reproductive health services to another medical practitioner who would be able to provide for the patient’s needs.

They claim that the right of other individuals to conscientiously object, such as: a) those working in public health facilities referred to in Section 7; b) public officers involved in the implementation of the law referred to in Section 23(b); and c) teachers in public schools referred to in Section 14 of the RH Law, are also not recognized.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[191]</sup><br><br>Petitioner Echavez and the other medical practitioners meanwhile, contend that the requirement to refer the matter to another health care service provider is still considered a compulsion on those objecting healthcare service providers.

Sections 9, 14 and 17 of the law are too secular that they tend to disregard the religion of Filipinos.

It is made up of people of diverse ethnic, cultural and religious beliefs and backgrounds. History has shown us that our government, in law and in practice, has allowed these various religious, cultural, social and racial groups to thrive in a single society together. It has embraced minority groups and is tolerant towards all – the religious people of different sects and the non-believers. The undisputed fact is that our people generally believe in a deity, whatever they conceived Him to be, and to whom they call for guidance and enlightenment in crafting our fundamental law. Thus, the preamble of the present Constitution reads:<br><br><blockquote>We, the sovereign Filipino people, <b><i>imploring the aid of Almighty God</i></b>, in order to build a just and humane society, and establish a Government that shall embody our ideals and aspirations, promote the common good, conserve and develop our patrimony, and secure to ourselves and our posterity, the blessings of independence and democracy under the rule of law and a regime of truth, justice, freedom, love, equality, and peace, do ordain and promulgate this Constitution.</blockquote><br>The Filipino people in <i>“imploring the aid of Almighty God”</i> manifested their spirituality innate in our nature and consciousness as a people, shaped by tradition and historical experience. As this is embodied in the preamble, it means that the State recognizes with respect the influence of religion in so far as it instills into the mind the purest principles of morality.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[205]</sup> Moreover, in recognition of the contributions of religion to society, the 1935, 1973 and 1987 constitutions contain benevolent and accommodating provisions towards religions such as tax exemption of church property, salary of religious officers in government institutions, and optional religious instructions in public schools.<br><br>The Framers, however, felt the need to put up a strong barrier so that the State would not encroach into the affairs of the church, and vice-versa. The principle of separation of Church and State was, thus, enshrined in Article II, Section 6 of the 1987 Constitution, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 6. </b>The separation of Church and State shall be inviolable.&nbsp; </blockquote><br>Verily, the principle of separation of Church and State is based on mutual respect. Generally, the State cannot meddle in the internal affairs of the church, much less question its faith and dogmas or dictate upon it. It cannot favor one religion and discriminate against another. On the other hand, the church cannot impose its beliefs and convictions on the State and the rest of the citizenry. It cannot demand that the nation follow its beliefs, even if it sincerely believes that they are good for the country.<br><br>Consistent with the principle that not any one religion should ever be preferred over another, the Constitution in the above-cited provision utilizes the term “church” in its generic sense, which refers to a temple, a mosque, an <i>iglesia</i>, or any other house of God which metaphorically symbolizes a religious organization. Thus, the “Church” means the religious congregations collectively.<br><br>Balancing the benefits that religion affords and the need to provide an ample barrier to protect the State from the pursuit of its secular objectives, the Constitution lays down the following mandate in Article III, Section 5 and Article VI, Section 29 (2), of the 1987 Constitution:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section. 5</b>. No law shall be made respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. The free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship, without discrimination or preference, shall forever be allowed. No religious test shall be required for the exercise of civil or political rights.<br><br><b>Section 29.</b><br><br>x x x.<br><br>No public money or property shall be appropriated, applied, paid, or employed, directly or indirectly, for the use, benefit, or support of any sect, church, denomination, sectarian institution, or system of religion, or of any priest, preacher, minister, other religious teacher, or dignitary as such, except when such priest, preacher, minister, or dignitary is assigned to the armed forces, or to any penal institution, or government orphanage or leprosarium.</blockquote><br>In short, the constitutional assurance of religious freedom provides two guarantees: the <i>Establishment Clause</i> and the <i>Free Exercise Clause.</i><br><br>The <b>establishment clause</b> “principally prohibits the State from sponsoring any religion or favoring any religion as against other religions. It mandates a strict neutrality in affairs among religious groups.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[206]</sup> Essentially, it prohibits the establishment of a state religion and the use of public resources for the support or prohibition of a religion.<br><br>On the other hand, the basis of the <b>free exercise clause</b> is the respect for the inviolability of the human conscience.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[207]</sup> Under this part of religious freedom guarantee, the State is prohibited from unduly interfering with the outside manifestations of one’s belief and faith.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[208]</sup> Explaining the concept of religious freedom, the Court, in <i>Victoriano v. Elizalde Rope Workers Union</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[209]</sup> wrote:<br><br><blockquote>The constitutional provisions not only prohibits legislation for the support of any religious tenets or the modes of worship of any sect, thus forestalling compulsion by law of the acceptance of any creed or the practice of any form of worship (U.S. Ballard, 322 U.S. 78, 88 L. ed. 1148, 1153), <b>but also assures the free exercise of one’s chosen form of religion within limits of utmost amplitude.</b> It has been said that the religion clauses of the Constitution are all designed to protect the broadest possible liberty of conscience, to allow each man to believe as his conscience directs, to profess his beliefs, and to live as he believes he ought to live, consistent with the liberty of others and with the common good. <b>Any legislation whose effect or purpose is to impede the observance of one or all religions, or to discriminate invidiously between the religions, is invalid, even though the burden may be characterized as being only indirect.</b> (Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 10 L.ed.2d 965, 83 S. Ct. 1970) But if the state regulates conduct by enacting, within its power, a general law which has for its purpose and effect to advance the state’s secular goals, the statute is valid despite its indirect burden on religious observance, unless the state can accomplish its purpose without imposing such burden. (<i>Braunfeld v. Brown, 366 U.S. 599, 6 L ed. 2d. 563, 81 S. Ct. 144; McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 444-5 and 449</i>).</blockquote><br>As expounded in <i>Escritor</i>,<br><br>The establishment and free exercise clauses were not designed to serve contradictory purposes. They have a single goal—to promote freedom of individual religious beliefs and practices. In simplest terms, the free exercise clause prohibits government from inhibiting religious beliefs with penalties for religious beliefs and practice, while the establishment clause prohibits government from inhibiting religious belief with rewards for religious beliefs and practices. In other words, the two religion clauses were intended to deny government the power to use either the carrot or the stick to influence individual religious beliefs and practices.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[210]</sup><br><br>Corollary to the guarantee of free exercise of one’s religion is the principle that the guarantee of religious freedom is comprised of two parts: the freedom to believe, and the freedom to act on one’s belief. The first part is absolute. As explained in<i> Gerona v. Secretary of Education</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[211]</sup><br><br><blockquote><b>The realm of belief and creed is infinite and limitless bounded only by one’s imagination and thought. So is the freedom of belief, including religious belief, limitless and without bounds</b>. One may believe in most anything, however strange, bizarre and unreasonable the same may appear to others, even heretical when weighed in the scales of orthodoxy or doctrinal standards. But between the freedom of belief and the exercise of said belief, there is quite a stretch of road to travel.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[212]</sup></blockquote><br>The second part however, is limited and subject to the awesome power of the State and can be enjoyed only with proper regard to the rights of others. It is “subject to regulation where the belief is <i>translated into external acts that affect the public welfare</i>.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[213]</sup><br><br><i>Legislative Acts and the<br>Free Exercise Clause</i><br><br>Thus, in case of conflict between the free exercise clause and the State, the Court adheres to the <b>doctrine of benevolent neutrality</b>. This has been clearly decided by the Court in <i>Estrada v. Escritor, (Escritor)</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[214]</sup> where it was stated “that benevolent <b>neutrality-accommodation</b>, whether mandatory or permissive, is the spirit, intent and framework underlying the Philippine Constitution.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[215]</sup> In the same case, it was further explained that”<br><br><blockquote>The <b>benevolent neutrality</b> theory believes that with respect to these governmental actions, <b>accommodation</b> of religion may be allowed, not to promote the government’s favored form of religion, but to allow individuals and groups to exercise their religion without hindrance. “The purpose of accommodation is to remove a burden on, or facilitate the exercise of, a person’s or institution’s religion.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[216]</sup> “What is sought under the <b>theory of accommodation</b> is not a declaration of unconstitutionality of a facially neutral law, but an exemption from its application or its ‘burdensome effect,’ whether by the legislature or the courts.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[217]</sup></blockquote><br>In ascertaining the limits of the exercise of religious freedom, the compelling state interest test is proper.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[218]</sup> Underlying the <b>compelling state interest test</b> is the notion that free exercise is a fundamental right and that laws burdening it should be subject to strict scrutiny.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[219]</sup> In <i>Escritor,</i> it was written:<br><br><blockquote>Philippine jurisprudence articulates several tests to determine these limits. Beginning with the first case on the Free Exercise Clause, <i>American Bible Society</i>, the Court mentioned the “<b>clear and present danger</b>” test but did not employ it. Nevertheless, this test continued to be cited in subsequent cases on religious liberty. The Gerona case then pronounced that the test of permissibility of religious freedom is whether it violates the established institutions of society and law. The <i>Victoriano </i>case mentioned the “<b>immediate and grave danger</b>” test as well as the doctrine that a law of general applicability may burden religious exercise provided the law is the least restrictive means to accomplish the goal of the law. The case also used, albeit inappropriately, the “<b>compelling state interest</b>” test. After <i>Victoriano, German</i> went back to the Gerona rule. <i>Ebralinag </i>then employed the “<b>grave and immediate danger</b>” test and overruled the Gerona test. The fairly recent case of <i>Iglesia ni Cristo</i> went back to the “<b>clear and present danger</b>” test in the maiden case of <i>American Bible Society</i>. <b>Not surprisingly, all the cases which employed the “clear and present danger” or “grave and immediate danger” test involved, in one form or another, religious speech as this test is often used in cases on freedom of expression</b>. On the other hand, the<i> Gerona </i>and <i>German</i> cases set the rule that religious freedom will not prevail over established institutions of society and law. <i>Gerona</i>, however, which was the authority cited by <i>German</i> has been overruled by Ebralinag which employed the “<b>grave and immediate danger</b>” test. <i>Victoriano</i> was the only case that employed the “<b>compelling state interest</b>” test, but as explained previously, the use of the test was inappropriate to the facts of the case.<br><br>The case at bar does not involve speech as in <i>American Bible Society, Ebralinag</i> and <i>Iglesia ni Cristo</i> where the “<b>clear and present danger</b>” and “<b>grave and immediate danger</b>” tests were appropriate as speech has easily discernible or immediate effects. The <i>Gerona</i> and <i>German doctrine,</i> aside from having been overruled, is not congruent with the <b>benevolent neutrality</b> approach, thus not appropriate in this jurisdiction. Similar to <i>Victoriano</i>, the present case involves purely conduct arising from religious belief. <b>The “compelling state interest” test is proper where conduct is involved for the whole gamut of human conduct has different effects on the state’s interests: some effects may be immediate and short-term while others delayed and far-reaching</b>. A test that would protect the interests of the state in preventing a substantive evil, whether immediate or delayed, is therefore necessary. However, not any interest of the state would suffice to prevail over the right to religious freedom as this is a fundamental right that enjoys a preferred position in the hierarchy of rights - “the most inalienable and sacred of all human rights”, in the words of Jefferson. This right is sacred for an invocation of the Free Exercise Clause is an appeal to a higher sovereignty. The entire constitutional order of limited government is premised upon an acknowledgment of such higher sovereignty, thus the Filipinos implore the “aid of Almighty God in order to build a just and humane society and establish a government.” As held in <i>Sherbert</i>, only the gravest abuses, endangering <b>paramount interests</b> can limit this fundamental right. A mere balancing of interests which balances a right with just a colorable state interest is therefore not appropriate. Instead, <b>only a compelling interest of the state can prevail over the fundamental right to religious liberty. <u>The test requires the state to carry a heavy burden, a compelling one, for to do otherwise would allow the state to batter religion, especially the less powerful ones until they are destroyed. In determining which shall prevail between the state’s interest and religious liberty, reasonableness shall be the guide</u>. The “compelling state interest” serves the purpose of revering religious liberty while at the same time affording protection to the paramount interests of the state.</b> This was the test used in <i>Sherbert</i> which involved conduct, <i>i.e. </i>refusal to work on Saturdays. In the end, the “compelling state interest” test, by upholding the paramount interests of the state, seeks to protect the very state, without which, religious liberty will not be preserved.

Underlining supplied.]</blockquote><br><center><u>The Court’s Position</u></center><br>In the case at bench, it is not within the province of the Court to determine whether the use of contraceptives or one’s participation in the support of modern reproductive health measures is moral from a religious standpoint or whether the same is right or wrong according to one’s dogma or belief. For the Court has declared that matters dealing with “faith, practice, doctrine, form of worship, ecclesiastical law, custom and rule of a church…are unquestionably ecclesiastical matters which are outside the province of the civil courts.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[220]</sup> The jurisdiction of the Court extends only to public and secular morality. Whatever pronouncement the Court makes in the case at bench should be understood only in this realm where it has authority. Stated otherwise, while the Court stands without authority to rule on ecclesiastical matters, as vanguard of the Constitution, it does have authority to determine whether the RH Law contravenes the guarantee of religious freedom.<br><br>At first blush, it appears that the RH Law recognizes and respects religion and religious beliefs and convictions. It is replete with assurances the no one can be compelled to violate the tenets of his religion or defy his religious convictions against his free will. Provisions in the RH Law respecting religious freedom are the following:<br><br><blockquote>1. The State recognizes and guarantees the human rights of all persons including their right to equality and nondiscrimination of these rights, the right to sustainable human development, the right to health which includes reproductive health, the right to education and information, and the <b>right to choose and make decisions for themselves in accordance with their religious convictions</b>, ethics, cultural beliefs, and the demands of responsible parenthood. [Section 2, Declaration of Policy]<br><br>2. The State recognizes marriage as an inviolable social institution and the foundation of the family which in turn is the foundation of the nation. Pursuant thereto, the State shall defend:<br><br><blockquote>(a) <b>The right of spouses to found a family in accordance with their religious convictions</b> and the demands of responsible parenthood.” [Section 2, Declaration of Policy]</blockquote><br>3. The State shall promote and provide information and access, without bias, to all methods of family planning, including effective natural and modern methods which have been proven medically safe, legal, non-abortifacient, and effective in accordance with scientific and evidence-based medical research standards such as those registered and approved by the FDA for the poor and marginalized as identified through the NHTS-PR and other government measures of identifying marginalization: Provided, That the State shall also provide funding support to promote modern natural methods of family planning, especially the Billings Ovulation Method, <b>consistent with the needs of acceptors and their religious convictions.</b> [Section 3(e), Declaration of Policy]<br><br>4. The State shall promote programs that: (1) enable individuals and couples to have the number of children they desire with due consideration to the health, particularly of women, and the resources available and affordable to them and in accordance with existing laws, public morals and their <b>religious convictions</b>. [Section 3(f)]<br><br>5. The State shall respect individuals’ preferences and choice of family planning methods that are <b>in accordance with their religious convictions</b> and cultural beliefs, taking into consideration the State’s obligations under various human rights instruments. [Section 3(h)]<br><br>6. Active participation by nongovernment organizations (NGOs), women’s and people’s organizations, civil society,<b> faith-based organizations, the religious</b> sector and communities is crucial to ensure that reproductive health and population and development policies, plans, and programs will address the priority needs of women, the poor, and the marginalized. [Section 3(i)]<br><br>7] Responsible parenthood refers to the will and ability of a parent to respond to the needs and aspirations of the family and children. It is likewise a shared responsibility between parents to determine and achieve the desired number of children, spacing and timing of their children according to their own family life aspirations, taking into account psychological preparedness, health status, sociocultural and economic concerns <b>consistent with their religious convictions</b>. [Section 4(v)] (Emphases supplied)</blockquote><br>While the Constitution prohibits abortion, laws were enacted allowing the use of contraceptives. To some medical practitioners, however, the whole idea of using contraceptives is an anathema. Consistent with the principle of benevolent neutrality, their beliefs should be respected.<br><br><i><u>The Establishment Clause<br>and Contraceptives</u></i><br><br>In the same breath that the establishment clause restricts what the government can do with religion, it also limits what religious sects can or cannot do with the government. They can neither cause the government to adopt their particular doctrines as policy for everyone, nor can they not cause the government to restrict other groups. To do so, in simple terms, would cause the State to adhere to a particular religion and, thus, establishing a state religion.<br><br>Consequently, the petitioners are misguided in their supposition that the State cannot enhance its population control program through the RH Law simply because the promotion of contraceptive use is contrary to their religious beliefs. Indeed, the State is not precluded to pursue its legitimate secular objectives without being dictated upon by the policies of any one religion. One cannot refuse to pay his taxes simply because it will cloud his conscience. The demarcation line between Church and State demands that one render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s and unto God the things that are God’s.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[221]</sup><br><br><i>The free exercise Clause and the Duty to Refer</i><br><br>While the RH Law, in espousing state policy to promote reproductive health manifestly respects diverse religious beliefs in line with the Non-Establishment Clause, the same conclusion cannot be reached with respect to Sections 7, 23 and 24 thereof. The said provisions commonly mandate that a hospital or a medical practitioner to immediately refer a person seeking health care and services under the law to another accessible healthcare provider despite their conscientious objections based on religious or ethical beliefs.<br><br>In a situation where the free exercise of religion is allegedly burdened by government legislation or practice, the <b>compelling state interest test</b> in line with the Court’s espousal of the Doctrine of Benevolent Neutrality in Escritor, finds application. In this case, the conscientious objector’s claim to religious freedom would warrant an exemption from obligations under the RH Law, unless the government succeeds in demonstrating a more compelling state interest in the accomplishment of an important secular objective. Necessarily so, the plea of conscientious objectors for exemption from the RH Law deserves no less than <b>strict scrutiny.</b><br><br>In applying the test, the first inquiry is whether a conscientious objector’s right to religious freedom has been burdened. As in <i>Escritor</i>, there is no doubt that an intense tug-of-war plagues a conscientious objector. One side coaxes him into obedience to the law and the abandonment of his religious beliefs, while the other entices him to a clean conscience yet under the pain of penalty. The scenario is an illustration of the predicament of medical practitioners whose religious beliefs are incongruent with what the RH Law promotes.<br><br>The Court is of the view that the obligation to refer imposed by the RH Law violates the religious belief and conviction of a conscientious objector. Once the medical practitioner, against his will, refers a patient seeking information on modern reproductive health products, services, procedures and methods, his conscience is immediately burdened as he has been compelled to perform an act against his beliefs. As Commissioner Joaquin A. Bernas (<i>Commissioner Bernas</i>) has written, “at the basis of the <b>free exercise clause</b> is the respect for the inviolability of the human conscience.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[222]</sup><br><br>Though it has been said that the act of referral is an opt-out clause, it is, however, a <i>false </i>compromise because it makes pro-life health providers complicit in the performance of an act that they find morally repugnant or offensive. They cannot, in conscience, do indirectly what they cannot do directly. One may not be the principal, but he is equally guilty if he abets the offensive act by indirect participation.<br><br>Moreover, the guarantee of religious freedom is necessarily intertwined with the right to free speech, it being an externalization of one’s thought and conscience. This in turn includes the right to be silent. With the constitutional guarantee of religious freedom follows the protection that should be afforded to individuals in communicating their beliefs to others as well as the protection for simply being silent. The Bill of Rights guarantees the liberty of the individual to utter what is in his mind and the liberty not to utter what is not in his mind.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[223]</sup> While the RH Law seeks to provide freedom of choice through informed consent, freedom of choice guarantees the liberty of the religious conscience and prohibits any degree of compulsion or burden, whether direct or indirect, in the practice of one’s religion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[224]</sup><br><br>In case of conflict between the religious beliefs and moral convictions of individuals, on one hand, and the interest of the State, on the other, to provide access and information on reproductive health products, services, procedures and methods to enable the people to determine the timing, number and spacing of the birth of their children, the Court is of the strong view that the religious freedom of health providers, whether public or private, should be accorded primacy. Accordingly, a <i>conscientious objector</i> should be exempt from compliance with the mandates of the RH Law. If he would be compelled to act contrary to his religious belief and conviction, it would be violative of “the principle of non-coercion” enshrined in the constitutional right to free exercise of religion.<br><br>Interestingly, on April 24, 2013, Scotland’s Inner House of the Court of Session, found in the case of <i>Doogan and Wood v. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde Health Board,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[225]</sup> that the midwives claiming to be conscientious objectors under the provisions of Scotland’s Abortion Act of 1967, could not be required to delegate, supervise or support staff on their labor ward who were involved in abortions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[226]</sup> The Inner House stated “that if ‘participation’ were defined according to whether the person was taking part ‘directly’ or ‘indirectly’ this would actually mean more complexity and uncertainty.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[227]</sup><br><br>While the said case did not cover the act of referral, the applicable principle was the same – they could not be forced to assist abortions if it would be against their conscience or will.<br><br><i>Institutional Health Providers</i><br><br>The same holds true with respect to non-maternity specialty hospitals and hospitals owned and operated by a religious group and health care service providers. Considering that Section 24 of the RH Law penalizes such institutions should they fail or refuse to comply with their duty to refer under Section 7 and Section 23(a)(3), the Court deems that it must be struck down for being violative of the freedom of religion. The same applies to Section 23(a)(1) and (a)(2) in relation to Section 24, considering that in the dissemination of information regarding programs and services and in the performance of reproductive health procedures, the religious freedom of health care service providers should be respected.<br><br><i>In the case of Islamic Da'wah Council of the Philippines, Inc. v. Office of the Executive Secretary</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[228]</sup> it was stressed:<br><br><blockquote><b>Freedom of religion was accorded preferred status by the framers of our fundamental law.</b> And this Court has consistently affirmed this preferred status, well aware that it is <b>"designed to protect the broadest possible liberty of conscience, to allow each man to believe as his conscience directs, to profess his beliefs, and to live as he believes he ought to live, consistent with the liberty of others and with the common good.</b>"<sup>10</sup></blockquote><br>The Court is not oblivious to the view that penalties provided by law endeavour to ensure compliance. Without set consequences for either an active violation or mere inaction, a law tends to be toothless and ineffectual. Nonetheless, when what is bartered for an effective implementation of a law is a constitutionally-protected right the Court firmly chooses to stamp its disapproval. The punishment of a healthcare service provider, who fails and/or refuses to refer a patient to another, or who declines to perform reproductive health procedure on a patient because incompatible religious beliefs, is a clear inhibition of a constitutional guarantee which the Court cannot allow.<br><br><i>The Implementing Rules and Regulation (RH-IRR)</i><br><br>The last paragraph of Section 5.24 of the RH-IRR reads:<br><br><blockquote>Provided, That <b>skilled health professional such as provincial, city or municipal health officers, chiefs of hospital, head nurses, supervising midwives</b>, among others, who by virtue of their office are specifically charged with the duty to implement the provisions of the RPRH Act and these Rules, <b>cannot be considered as conscientious objectors</b>.</blockquote><br>This is discriminatory and violative of the equal protection clause. The conscientious objection clause should be equally protective of the religious belief of public health officers. There is no perceptible distinction why they should not be considered exempt from the mandates of the law. The protection accorded to other conscientious objectors should equally apply to all medical practitioners without distinction whether they belong to the public or private sector. After all, the freedom to believe is intrinsic in every individual and the protective robe that guarantees its free exercise is not taken off even if one acquires employment in the government.<br><br>It should be stressed that intellectual liberty occupies a place inferior to none in the hierarchy of human values. The mind must be free to think what it wills, whether in the secular or religious sphere, to give expression to its beliefs by oral discourse or through the media and, thus, seek other candid views in occasions or gatherings or in more permanent aggrupation. Embraced in such concept then are freedom of religion, freedom of speech, of the press, assembly and petition, and freedom of association.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[229]</sup><br><br>The discriminatory provision is void not only because no such exception is stated in the RH Law itself but also because it is violative of the equal protection clause in the Constitution. Quoting respondent Lagman, if there is any conflict between the RH-IRR and the RH Law, the law must prevail.<br><br><blockquote><b>Justice Mendoza</b>:<br>I’ll go to another point. The RH law…in your Comment- in-Intervention on page 52, you mentioned RH Law is replete with provisions in upholding the freedom of religion and respecting religious convictions. Earlier, you affirmed this with qualifications. Now, you have read, I presumed you have read the IRR-Implementing Rules and Regulations of the RH Bill?<br><br><b>Congressman Lagman:&nbsp; </b><br>Yes, Your Honor, I have read but I have to admit, it’s a long IRR and I have not thoroughly dissected the nuances of the provisions.<br><br><b>Justice Mendoza:</b><br>I will read to you one provision. It’s Section 5.24. This I cannot find in the RH Law. But in the IRR it says: “….skilled health professionals such as provincial, city or municipal health officers, chief of hospitals, head nurses, supervising midwives, among others, who by virtue of their office are specifically charged with the duty to implement the provisions of the RPRH Act and these Rules, cannot be considered as conscientious objectors.” Do you agree with this?<br><br><b>Congressman Lagman:</b><br>I will have to go over again the provisions, Your Honor.<br><br><b>Justice Mendoza:</b><br>In other words, public health officers in contrast to the private practitioners who can be conscientious objectors, skilled health professionals cannot be considered conscientious objectors. Do you agree with this? Is this not against the constitutional right to the religious belief?<br><br><b>Congressman Lagman:</b><br>Your Honor, if there is any conflict between the IRR and the law, the law must prevail.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[230]</sup></blockquote><br><i>Compelling State Interest</i><br><br>The foregoing discussion then begets the question on whether the respondents, in defense of the subject provisions, were able to: 1] demonstrate a more compelling state interest to restrain conscientious objectors in their choice of services to render; and 2] discharge the burden of proof that the obligatory character of the law is the least intrusive means to achieve the objectives of the law.<br><br>Unfortunately, a deep scrutiny of the respondents’ submissions proved to be in vain. The OSG was curiously silent in the establishment of a more compelling state interest that would rationalize the curbing of a conscientious objector’s right not to adhere to an action contrary to his religious convictions. During the oral arguments, the OSG maintained the same silence and evasion. The Transcripts of the Stenographic Notes disclose the following:<br><br><blockquote><b>Justice De Castro:</b><br>Let’s go back to the duty of the conscientious objector to refer…<br><br><b>Senior State Solicitor Hilbay:</b><br>Yes, Justice.<br><br><b>Justice De Castro:</b><br>...which you are discussing awhile ago with Justice Abad. What is the compelling State interest in imposing this duty to refer to a conscientious objector which refuses to do so because of his religious belief?<br><br><b>Senior State Solicitor Hilbay:</b><br>Ahh, Your Honor,..<br><br><b>Justice De Castro:</b><br>What is the compelling State interest to impose this burden?<br><br><b>Senior State Solicitor Hilbay:</b><br>In the first place, Your Honor, <b>I don’t believe that the standard is a compelling State interest</b>, this is an ordinary health legislation involving professionals. This is not a free speech matter or a pure free exercise matter. This is a regulation by the State of the relationship between medical doctors and their patients.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[231]</sup></blockquote><br>Resultantly, the Court finds <b>no compelling state interest</b> which would limit the free exercise clause of the <b>conscientious objectors</b>, however few in number. Only the prevention of an immediate and grave danger to the security and welfare of the community can justify the infringement of religious freedom. If the government fails to show the seriousness and immediacy of the threat, State intrusion is constitutionally unacceptable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[232]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Freedom of religion means more than just the freedom to believe. It also means the freedom to act or not to act according to what one believes. And this freedom is violated when one is compelled to act against one’s belief or is prevented from acting according to one’s belief.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[233]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Apparently, in these cases, there is <b>no immediate danger to the life or health</b> of an individual in the perceived scenario of the subject provisions. After all, a couple who plans the timing, number and spacing of the birth of their children refers to a future event that is contingent on whether or not the mother decides to adopt or use the information, product, method or supply given to her or whether she even decides to become pregnant at all. On the other hand, the burden placed upon those who object to contraceptive use is immediate and occurs the moment a patient seeks consultation on reproductive health matters.<br><br>Moreover, granting that a compelling interest exists to justify the infringement of the conscientious objector’s religious freedom, the respondents have failed to demonstrate “the gravest abuses, endangering paramount interests” which could limit or override a person’s fundamental right to religious freedom. Also, the respondents have not presented any government effort exerted to show that the means it takes to achieve its legitimate state objective is the <b>least intrusive means</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[234]</sup> Other than the assertion that the act of referring would only be momentary, considering that the act of referral by a conscientious objector is the very action being contested as violative of religious freedom, it behooves the respondents to demonstrate that no other means can be undertaken by the State to achieve its objective without violating the rights of the conscientious objector. The health concerns of women may still be addressed by other practitioners who may perform reproductive health-related procedures with open willingness and motivation. Suffice it to say, a person who is forced to perform an act in utter reluctance deserves the protection of the Court as the last vanguard of constitutional freedoms.<br><br>At any rate, there are other secular steps already taken by the Legislature to ensure that the right to health is protected. Considering other legislations as they stand now, R.A. No. 4729 or the Contraceptive Act, R.A. No. 6365 or “The Population Act of the Philippines” and R.A. No. 9710, otherwise known as “The <i>Magna Carta</i> of Women,” amply cater to the needs of women in relation to health services and programs. The pertinent provision of Magna Carta on comprehensive health services and programs for women, in fact, reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 17. <i>Women's Right to Health.</i></b> - (a) Comprehensive Health Services. - The State shall, at all times, provide for a comprehensive, culture-sensitive, and gender-responsive health services and programs covering all stages of a woman's life cycle and which addresses the major causes of women's mortality and morbidity: <i>Provided</i>, That in the provision for comprehensive health services, due respect shall be accorded to women's religious convictions, the rights of the spouses to found a family in accordance with their religious convictions, and the demands of responsible parenthood, and the right of women to protection from hazardous drugs, devices, interventions, and substances.<br><br>Access to the following services shall be ensured:<br><br><blockquote>(1) Maternal care to include pre- and post-natal services to address pregnancy and infant health and nutrition;<br><br>(2) Promotion of breastfeeding;<br><br>(3) Responsible, ethical, legal, safe, and effective methods of family planning;<br><br>(4) Family and State collaboration in youth sexuality education and health services without prejudice to the primary right and duty of parents to educate their children;<br><br>(5) Prevention and management of reproductive tract infections, including sexually transmitted diseases, HIV, and AIDS;<br><br>(6) Prevention and management of reproductive tract cancers like breast and cervical cancers, and other gynecological conditions and disorders;<br><br>(7) Prevention of abortion and management of pregnancy-related complications;<br><br>(8) In cases of violence against women and children, women and children victims and survivors shall be provided with comprehensive health services that include psychosocial, therapeutic, medical, and legal interventions and assistance towards healing, recovery, and empowerment;<br><br>(9) Prevention and management of infertility and sexual dysfunction pursuant to ethical norms and medical standards;<br><br>(10) Care of the elderly women beyond their child-bearing years; and<br><br>(11) Management, treatment, and intervention of mental health problems of women and girls. In addition, healthy lifestyle activities are encouraged and promoted through programs and projects as strategies in the prevention of diseases.</blockquote><br>(b) Comprehensive Health Information and Education. - The State shall provide women in all sectors with appropriate, timely, complete, and accurate information and education on all the above-stated aspects of women's health in government education and training programs, with due regard to the following:<br><br><blockquote>(1) The natural and primary right and duty of parents in the rearing of the youth and the development of moral character and the right of children to be brought up in an atmosphere of morality and rectitude for the enrichment and strengthening of character;<br><br>(2) The formation of a person's sexuality that affirms human dignity; and<br><br>(3) Ethical, legal, safe, and effective family planning methods including fertility awareness.</blockquote></blockquote><br>As an afterthought, Asst. Solicitor General Hilbay eventually replied that the compelling state interest was “Fifteen maternal deaths per day, hundreds of thousands of unintended pregnancies, lives changed, x x x.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[235]</sup> He, however, failed to substantiate this point by concrete facts and figures from reputable sources.<br><br>The undisputed fact, however, is that the World Health Organization reported that the Filipino maternal mortality rate dropped to 48 percent from 1990 to 2008,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[236]</sup> although there was still no RH Law at that time. Despite such revelation, the proponents still insist that such number of maternal deaths constitute a compelling state interest.<br><br>Granting that there are still deficiencies and flaws in the delivery of social healthcare programs for Filipino women, they could not be solved by a measure that puts an unwarrantable stranglehold on religious beliefs in exchange for blind conformity.<br><br><i>Exception: Life Threatening Cases</i><br><br>All this notwithstanding, the Court properly recognizes a valid exception set forth in the law. While generally healthcare service providers cannot be forced to render reproductive health care procedures if doing it would contravene their religious beliefs, an <b>exception </b>must be made in <b>life-threatening cases</b> that require the performance of emergency procedures. In these situations, the right to life of the mother should be given preference, considering that a referral by a medical practitioner would amount to a denial of service, resulting to unnecessarily placing the life of a mother in grave danger. Thus, during the oral arguments, Atty. Liban, representing CFC, manifested: “the forced referral clause that we are objecting on grounds of violation of freedom of religion <b>does not contemplate an emergency.</b>”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[237]</sup><br><br>In a conflict situation between the life of the mother and the life of a child, the doctor is morally obliged always to try to save both lives. If, however, it is impossible, the resulting death to one should not be deliberate. Atty. Noche explained:<br><br><blockquote><b>Principle of Double-Effect</b>. - May we please remind the principal author of the RH Bill in the House of Representatives of the principle of double-effect wherein intentional harm on the life of either the mother of the child is never justified to bring about a “good” effect. In a conflict situation between the life of the child and the life of the mother, the doctor is <b>morally obliged always to try to save both lives.</b> However, he can act in favor of one (not necessarily the mother) when it <b>is medically impossible to save both</b>, provided that no direct harm is intended to the other. If the above principles are observed, the loss of the child’s life or the mother’s life is <b>not intentional</b> and, therefore, <b>unavoidable</b>. Hence, the doctor would not be guilty of abortion or murder. The mother is never pitted against the child because both their lives are equally valuable. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[238]</sup></blockquote><br>Accordingly, if it is necessary to save the life of a mother, procedures endangering the life of the child may be resorted to even if is against the religious sentiments of the medical practitioner. As quoted above, whatever burden imposed upon a medical practitioner in this case would have been more than justified considering the life he would be able to save.<br><br><i>Family Planning Seminars</i><br><br>Anent the requirement imposed under Section 15<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[239]</sup> as a condition for the issuance of a marriage license, the Court finds the same to be a reasonable exercise of police power by the government. A cursory reading of the assailed provision bares that the religious freedom of the petitioners is not at all violated. All the law requires is for would-be spouses to attend a seminar on parenthood, family planning breastfeeding and infant nutrition. It does not even mandate the type of family planning methods to be included in the seminar, whether they be natural or artificial. As correctly noted by the OSG, those who receive any information during their attendance in the required seminars are not compelled to accept the information given to them, are completely free to reject the information they find unacceptable, and retain the freedom to decide on matters of family life without the intervention of the State.<br><br><b>4-<u>The Family and the Right to Privacy</u></b><br><br>Petitioner CFC assails the RH Law because Section 23(a) (2) (i) thereof violates the provisions of the Constitution by intruding into marital privacy and autonomy. It argues that it cultivates disunity and fosters animosity in the family rather than promote its solidarity and total development.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[240]</sup><br><br>The Court cannot but agree.<br><br>The 1987 Constitution is replete with provisions strengthening the <b>family</b> as it is the <b>basic social institution.</b> In fact, one article, Article XV, is devoted entirely to the family.<br><br><blockquote><b><center>ARTICLE XV<br>THE FAMILY</center></b><br>Section 1. The State recognizes the <b>Filipino family</b> as the foundation of the nation. Accordingly, it shall <b>strengthen its solidarity</b> and actively promote its total development.<br><br>Section 2. Marriage, as an inviolable social institution, is the foundation of the family and shall be <b>protected by the State</b>.<br><br>Section 3. The State shall defend:<br><br><blockquote>The <b>right of spouses to found a family in accordance with their <u>religious convictions</u></b> and the demands of responsible parenthood;<br><br>The right of children to assistance, including proper care and nutrition, and special protection from all forms of neglect, abuse, cruelty, exploitation and other conditions prejudicial to their development;<br><br>The right of the family to a family living wage and income; and<br><br>The right of families or family associations <b>to participate in the planning and implementation of policies and programs that affect them.</b></blockquote></blockquote><br>In this case, the RH Law, in its not-so-hidden desire to control population growth, contains provisions which tend to wreck the family as a solid social institution. It bars the husband and/or the father from participating in the decision making process regarding their common future progeny. It likewise deprives the parents of their authority over their minor daughter simply because she is already a parent or had suffered a miscarriage.<br><br><i>The Family and Spousal Consent</i><br><br>Section 23(a) (2) (i) of the RH Law states:<br><br><blockquote>The following acts are prohibited:<br><br>(a) Any health care service provider, whether public or private, who shall: …<br><br>(2) refuse to perform legal and medically-safe reproductive health procedures on any person of legal age on the ground of lack of consent or authorization of the following persons in the following instances:<br><br><blockquote>(i) Spousal consent in case of married persons: provided, <b>That in case of disagreement, the decision of the one undergoing the procedures shall prevail.</b> [Emphasis supplied]</blockquote></blockquote><br>The above provision refers to reproductive health procedures like tubal litigation and vasectomy which, by their very nature, should require mutual consent and decision between the husband and the wife as they affect issues intimately related to the founding of a family. Section 3, Art. XV of the Constitution espouses that the State shall defend the “right of the spouses to found a family.” One person cannot found a family. The right, therefore, is shared by <b><i>both</i></b> spouses. In the same Section 3, their right <i>“to participate in the planning and implementation of policies and programs that affect them” </i>is equally recognized.<br><br>The RH Law cannot be allowed to infringe upon this mutual decision-making. By giving absolute authority to the spouse who would undergo a procedure, and barring the other spouse from participating in the decision would drive a wedge between the husband and wife, possibly result in bitter animosity, and endanger the marriage and the family, all for the sake of reducing the population. This would be a marked departure from the policy of the State to protect marriage as an inviolable social institution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[241]</sup><br><br>Decision-making involving a reproductive health procedure is a private matter which belongs to the couple, not just one of them. Any decision they would reach would affect their future as a family because the size of the family or the number of their children significantly matters. The decision whether or not to undergo the procedure belongs exclusively to, and shared by, both spouses as <b>one cohesive unit</b> as they chart their own destiny. It is a <b>constitutionally guaranteed private right</b>. Unless it prejudices the State, which has not shown any compelling interest, the State should see to it that they chart their destiny together as one family.<br><br>As highlighted by Justice Leonardo-De Castro, Section 19(c) of R.A. No. 9710, otherwise known as the “Magna Carta for Women,” provides that women shall have equal rights in all matters relating to marriage and family relations, including the <b>joint decision</b> on the number and spacing of their children. Indeed, responsible parenthood, as Section 3(v) of the RH Law states, is a <b>shared responsibility</b> between parents. Section 23(a)(2)(i) of the RH Law should not be allowed to betray the constitutional mandate to protect and strengthen the family by giving to only one spouse the absolute authority to decide whether to undergo reproductive health procedure.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[242]</sup><br><br>The right to chart their own destiny together falls within the protected zone of marital privacy and such state intervention would encroach into the zones of spousal privacy guaranteed by the Constitution. In our jurisdiction, the right to privacy was first recognized in <i>Morfe v. Mutuc</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[243]</sup> where the Court, speaking through Chief Justice Fernando, held that “the right to privacy as such is accorded recognition independently of its identification with liberty; in itself, it is fully deserving of constitutional protection.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[244]</sup> Morfe adopted the ruling of the US Supreme Court in <i>Griswold v. Connecticut</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[245]</sup> where Justice William O. Douglas wrote:<br><br><blockquote>We deal with a right of privacy older than the Bill of Rights – older than our political parties, older than our school system. Marriage is a coming together for better or for worse, hopefully enduring, and intimate to the degree of being sacred. It is an association that promotes a way of life, not causes; a harmony in living, not political faiths; a bilateral loyalty, not commercial or social projects. Yet it is an association for as noble a purpose as any involved in our prior decisions.</blockquote><br>Ironically, <i>Griswold</i> invalidated a Connecticut statute which made the use of contraceptives a criminal offense on the ground of its amounting to an unconstitutional invasion of the right to privacy of married persons. Nevertheless, it recognized the zone of privacy rightfully enjoyed by couples. Justice Douglas in <i>Grisworld</i> wrote that “specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights have penumbras, formed by emanations from those guarantees that help give them life and substance. Various guarantees create zones of privacy.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[246]</sup><br><br>At any rate, in case of conflict between the couple, the courts will decide.<br><br><i>The Family and Parental Consent</i><br><br>Equally deplorable is the debarment of parental consent in cases where the minor, who will be undergoing a procedure, is already a parent or has had a miscarriage. Section 7 of the RH law provides:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 7. Access to Family Planning. – X x x.<br><br>No person shall be denied information and access to family planning services, whether natural or artificial: Provided, That minors will not be allowed access to modern methods of family planning without written consent from their parents or guardian/s except <b>when the minor is already a parent or has had a miscarriage</b>.</blockquote><br>There can be no other interpretation of this provision except that when a minor is already a parent or has had a miscarriage, the parents are <b>excluded</b> from the decision making process of the minor with regard to family planning. Even if she is not yet emancipated, the parental authority is already cut off just because there is a need to tame population growth.<br><br>It is precisely in such situations when a minor parent needs the comfort, care, advice, and guidance of her own parents. The State cannot replace her natural mother and father when it comes to providing her needs and comfort. To say that their consent is no longer relevant is clearly anti-family. It does not promote unity in the family. It is an affront to the constitutional mandate to protect and strengthen the family as an inviolable social institution.<br><br>More alarmingly, it disregards and disobeys the constitutional mandate that “the natural and primary right and duty of parents in the rearing of the youth for civic efficiency and the development of moral character shall receive the support of the Government.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[247]</sup> In this regard, Commissioner Bernas wrote:<br><br><blockquote>The 1987 provision has added the adjective <b>“primary”</b> to modify the right of parents. <b><u>It imports the assertion that the right of parents is superior to that of the State</u></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[248]</sup> [Emphases supplied]</blockquote><br>To insist on a rule that interferes with the right of parents to exercise parental control over their minor-child or the right of the spouses to mutually decide on matters which very well affect the very purpose of marriage, that is, the establishment of conjugal and family life, would result in the violation of one’s privacy with respect to his family. It would be dismissive of the unique and strongly-held Filipino tradition of maintaining close family ties and violative of the recognition that the State affords couples entering into the special contract of marriage to as one unit in forming the foundation of the family and society.<br><br>The State cannot, without a compelling state interest, take over the role of parents in the care and custody of a minor child, whether or not the latter is already a parent or has had a miscarriage. Only a compelling state interest can justify a state substitution of their parental authority.<br><br><i>First Exception: Access to Information</i><br><br>Whether with respect to the minor referred to under the exception provided in the second paragraph of Section 7 or with respect to the consenting spouse under Section 23(a)(2)(i), a distinction must be made. There must be a differentiation between access to <i>information </i>about family planning services, on one hand, and access to the reproductive health procedures and modern family planning methods themselves, on the other. Insofar as access to information is concerned, the Court finds no constitutional objection to the acquisition of information by the minor referred to under the exception in the second paragraph of Section 7 that would enable her to take proper care of her own body and that of her unborn child. After all, Section 12, Article II of the Constitution mandates the State to protect both the life of the mother as that of the unborn child. Considering that information to enable a person to make informed decisions is essential in the protection and maintenance of ones’ health, access to such information with respect to reproductive health must be allowed. In this situation, the fear that parents might be deprived of their parental control is unfounded because they are not prohibited to exercise parental guidance and control over their minor child and assist her in deciding whether to accept or reject the information received.<br><br><i>Second Exception: Life Threatening Cases</i><br><br>As in the case of the conscientious objector, an exception must be made <b>in life-threatening cases</b> that require the performance of emergency procedures. In such cases, the life of the minor who has already suffered a miscarriage and that of the spouse should not be put at grave risk simply for lack of consent. It should be emphasized that no person should be denied the appropriate medical care urgently needed to preserve the primordial right, that is, the right to life.<br><br>In this connection, the second sentence of Section 23(a)(2)(ii)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[249]</sup> should be struck down. By effectively limiting the requirement of parental consent to “only in elective surgical procedures,” it denies the parents their right of parental authority in cases where what is involved are “non-surgical procedures.” Save for the two exceptions discussed above, and in the case of an abused child as provided in the first sentence of Section 23(a)(2)(ii), the parents should not be deprived of their constitutional right of parental authority. To deny them of this right would be an affront to the constitutional mandate to protect and strengthen the family.<br><br><center><b>5 - <u>Academic Freedom</u></b></center><br>It is asserted that Section 14 of the RH Law, in relation to Section 24 thereof, mandating the teaching of Age-and Development-Appropriate Reproductive Health Education under threat of fine and/or imprisonment violates the principle of academic freedom. According to the petitioners, these provisions effectively force educational institutions to teach reproductive health education even if they believe that the same is not suitable to be taught to their students.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[250]</sup> Citing various studies conducted in the United States and statistical data gathered in the country, the petitioners aver that the prevalence of contraceptives has led to an increase of out-of-wedlock births; divorce and breakdown of families; the acceptance of abortion and euthanasia; the “feminization of poverty”; the aging of society; and promotion of promiscuity among the youth.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[251]</sup><br><br>At this point, suffice it to state that any attack on the validity of Section 14 of the RH Law is <b><i>premature</i></b> because the Department of Education, Culture and Sports has yet to formulate a curriculum on age-appropriate reproductive health education. One can only speculate on the content, manner and medium of instruction that will be used to educate the adolescents and whether they will contradict the religious beliefs of the petitioners and validate their apprehensions. Thus, considering the premature nature of this particular issue, the Court declines to rule on its constitutionality or validity.<br><br>At any rate, Section 12, Article II of the 1987 Constitution provides that the natural and primary right and duty of parents in the rearing of the youth for civic efficiency and development of moral character shall receive the support of the Government. Like the 1973 Constitution and the 1935 Constitution, the 1987 Constitution affirms the State recognition of the invaluable role of parents in preparing the youth to become productive members of society. Notably, it places more importance on the role of parents in the development of their children by recognizing that said role shall be <b>“primary,”</b> that is, that the right of parents in upbringing the youth is superior to that of the State.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[252]</sup><br><br>It is also the inherent right of the State to act as <i>parens patriae</i> to aid parents in the moral development of the youth. Indeed, the Constitution makes mention of the importance of developing the youth and their important role in nation building.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[253]</sup> Considering that Section 14 provides not only for the age-appropriate-reproductive health education, but also for values formation; the development of knowledge and skills in self-protection against discrimination; sexual abuse and violence against women and children and other forms of gender based violence and teen pregnancy; physical, social and emotional changes in adolescents; women’s rights and children’s rights; responsible teenage behavior; gender and development; and responsible parenthood, and that Rule 10, Section 11.01 of the RH-IRR and Section 4(t) of the RH Law itself provides for the teaching of responsible teenage behavior, gender sensitivity and physical and emotional changes among adolescents – the Court finds that the legal mandate provided under the assailed provision supplements, rather than supplants, the rights and duties of the parents in the moral development of their children.<br><br>Furthermore, as Section 14 also mandates that the mandatory reproductive health education program shall be developed in conjunction with parent-teacher-community associations, school officials and other interest groups, it could very well be said that it will be in line with the religious beliefs of the petitioners. By imposing such a condition, it becomes apparent that the petitioners’ contention that Section 14 violates Article XV, Section 3(1) of the Constitution is without merit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[254]</sup><br><br>While the Court notes the possibility that educators might raise their objection to their participation in the reproductive health education program provided under Section 14 of the RH Law on the ground that the same violates their religious beliefs, the Court reserves its judgment should an actual case be filed before it.<br><br><center><b>6 - <u>Due Process</u></b></center><br>The petitioners contend that the RH Law suffers from vagueness and, thus violates the due process clause of the Constitution. According to them, Section 23 (a)(1) mentions a “private health service provider” among those who may be held punishable but does not define who is a “private health care service provider.” They argue that confusion further results since Section 7 only makes reference to a “private health care institution.”<br><br>The petitioners also point out that Section 7 of the assailed legislation exempts hospitals operated by religious groups from rendering reproductive health <i>service</i> and <i>modern family planning methods.</i> It is unclear, however, if these institutions are also exempt from giving reproductive health <i>information</i> under Section 23(a)(1), or from rendering reproductive health <i>procedures</i> under Section 23(a)(2).<br><br>Finally, it is averred that the RH Law punishes the withholding, restricting and providing of incorrect information, but at the same time fails to define “incorrect information.”<br><br>The arguments fail to persuade.<br><br>A statute or act suffers from the defect of vagueness when it lacks comprehensible standards that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess its meaning and differ as to its application. It is repugnant to the Constitution in two respects: (1) it violates due process for failure to accord persons, especially the parties targeted by it, fair notice of the conduct to avoid; and (2) it leaves law enforcers unbridled discretion in carrying out its provisions and becomes an arbitrary flexing of the Government muscle.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[255]</sup> Moreover, in determining whether the words used in a statute are vague, words must not only be taken in accordance with their plain meaning alone, but also in relation to other parts of the statute. It is a rule that every part of the statute must be interpreted with reference to the context, that is, every part of it must be construed together with the other parts and kept subservient to the general intent of the whole enactment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[256]</sup><br><br>As correctly noted by the OSG, in determining the definition of “private health care service provider,” reference must be made to Section 4(n) of the RH Law which defines a “public health service provider,” viz:<br><br><blockquote>(n) <i>Public health care service provider</i> refers to: (1) public health care institution, which is duly licensed and accredited and devoted primarily to the maintenance and operation of facilities for health promotion, disease prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care of individuals suffering from illness, disease, injury, disability or deformity, or in need of obstetrical or other medical and nursing care; (2) public health care professional, who is a doctor of medicine, a nurse or a midwife; (3) public health worker engaged in the delivery of health care services; or (4) barangay health worker who has undergone training programs under any accredited government and NGO and who voluntarily renders primarily health care services in the community after having been accredited to function as such by the local health board in accordance with the guidelines promulgated by the Department of Health (DOH).</blockquote><br>Further, the use of the term “private health care institution” in Section 7 of the law, instead of “private health care service provider,” should not be a cause of confusion for the obvious reason that they are used synonymously.<br><br>The Court need not belabor the issue of whether the right to be exempt from being obligated to render reproductive health service and modern family planning methods, includes exemption from being obligated to give reproductive health information and to render reproductive health procedures. Clearly, subject to the qualifications and exemptions earlier discussed, the right to be exempt from being obligated to render reproductive health service and modern family planning methods, <b>necessarily includes exemption</b> from being obligated to give reproductive health information and to render reproductive health procedures. The terms “service” and “methods” are broad enough to include the providing of information and the rendering of medical procedures.<br><br>The same can be said with respect to the contention that the RH Law punishes health care service providers who intentionally withhold, restrict and provide incorrect information regarding reproductive health programs and services. For ready reference, the assailed provision is hereby quoted as follows:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 23. <i>Prohibited Acts.</i> – The following acts are prohibited:<br><br>(a) Any health care service provider, whether public or private, who shall:<br><br>(1) Knowingly withhold information or restrict the dissemination thereof, and/or intentionally provide incorrect information regarding programs and services on reproductive health including the right to informed choice and access to a full range of legal, medically-safe, non-abortifacient and effective family planning methods;<br></blockquote><br>From its plain meaning, the word “incorrect” here denotes failing to agree with a copy or model or with established rules; inaccurate, faulty; failing to agree with the requirements of duty, morality or propriety; and failing to coincide with the truth.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[257]</sup> On the other hand, the word “knowingly” means with awareness or deliberateness that is intentional.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[258]</sup> Used together in relation to Section 23(a)(1), they connote a sense of malice and ill motive to mislead or misrepresent the public as to the nature and effect of programs and services on reproductive health. Public health and safety demand that health care service providers give their honest and correct medical information in accordance with what is acceptable in medical practice. While health care service providers are not barred from expressing their own personal opinions regarding the programs and services on reproductive health, their right must be tempered with the need to provide public health and safety. The public deserves no less.<br><br><center><b>7-<u>Equal Protection</u></b></center><br><br>The petitioners also claim that the RH Law violates the equal protection clause under the Constitution as it discriminates against the poor because it makes them the primary target of the government program that promotes contraceptive use. They argue that, rather than promoting reproductive health among the poor, the RH Law introduces contraceptives that would effectively reduce the number of the poor. Their bases are the various provisions in the RH Law dealing with the poor, especially those mentioned in the guiding principles<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[259]</sup> and definition of terms<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[260]</sup> of the law.<br><br>They add that the exclusion of private educational institutions from the mandatory reproductive health education program imposed by the RH Law renders it unconstitutional.<br><br>In <i>Biraogo v. Philippine Truth Commission,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[261]</sup> the Court had the occasion to expound on the concept of equal protection. Thus:<br><br><blockquote>One of the basic principles on which this government was founded is that of the equality of right which is embodied in Section 1, Article III of the 1987 Constitution. The equal protection of the laws is embraced in the concept of due process, as every unfair discrimination offends the requirements of justice and fair play. It has been embodied in a separate clause, however, to provide for a more specific guaranty against any form of undue favoritism or hostility from the government. Arbitrariness in general may be challenged on the basis of the due process clause. But if the particular act assailed partakes of an unwarranted partiality or prejudice, the sharper weapon to cut it down is the equal protection clause.<br><br>“According to a long line of decisions, <b>equal protection simply requires that all persons or things similarly situated should be treated alike, both as to rights conferred and responsibilities imposed</b>.” It “requires public bodies and institutions to treat similarly situated individuals in a similar manner.” “The purpose of the equal protection clause is to secure every person within a state’s jurisdiction against intentional and arbitrary discrimination, whether occasioned by the express terms of a statue or by its improper execution through the state’s duly constituted authorities.” “In other words, the concept of equal justice under the law requires the state to govern impartially, and it may not draw distinctions between individuals solely on differences that are irrelevant to a legitimate governmental objective.”<br><br>The equal protection clause is aimed at all official state actions, not just those of the legislature. Its inhibitions cover all the departments of the government including the political and executive departments, and extend to all actions of a state denying equal protection of the laws, through whatever agency or whatever guise is taken.<br><br>It, however,<b> does not require the universal application of the laws to all persons or things without distinction</b>. What it simply requires is equality among equals as determined according to a valid classification. Indeed, the equal protection clause permits classification. Such classification, however, to be valid must pass the test of reasonableness. The test has four requisites: (1) The classification rests on substantial distinctions; (2) It is germane to the purpose of the law; (3) It is not limited to existing conditions only; and (4) It applies equally to all members of the same class. “Superficial differences do not make for a valid classification.”<br><br><b>For a classification to meet the requirements of constitutionality, it must include or embrace all persons who naturally belong to the class.</b> “The classification will be regarded as invalid if all the members of the class are not similarly treated, both as to rights conferred and obligations imposed. It is not necessary that the classification be made with absolute symmetry, in the sense that the members of the class should possess the same characteristics in equal degree. Substantial similarity will suffice; and as long as this is achieved, all those covered by the classification are to be treated equally. The mere fact that an individual belonging to a class differs from the other members, as long as that class is substantially distinguishable from all others, does not justify the non-application of the law to him.”<br><br>The classification must not be based on existing circumstances only, or so constituted as to preclude addition to the number included in the class. It must be of such a nature as to embrace all those who may thereafter be in similar circumstances and conditions. It must not leave out or “underinclude” those that should otherwise fall into a certain classification.

In fact, it is pursuant to Section 11, Article XIII of the Constitution which recognizes the distinct necessity to address the needs of the underprivileged by providing that they be given priority in addressing the health development of the people. Thus:<br><br><blockquote>Section 11. The State shall adopt an integrated and comprehensive approach to health development which shall endeavor to make essential goods, health and other social services available to all the people at affordable cost. <u>There shall be priority</u> for the needs of the <u>underprivileged, sick, elderly, disabled, women, and children</u>. The State shall endeavor to provide <u>free medical care to paupers</u>.</blockquote><br>It should be noted that Section 7 of the RH Law prioritizes poor and marginalized couples <i>who are suffering from fertility issues and desire to have children</i>. There is, therefore, no merit to the contention that the RH Law only seeks to target the poor to reduce their number. While the RH Law admits the use of contraceptives, it does not, as elucidated above, sanction abortion. As Section 3(l) explains, the “promotion and/or stabilization of the population growth rate is incidental to the advancement of reproductive health.”<br><br>Moreover, the RH Law does not prescribe the number of children a couple may have and does not impose conditions upon couples who intend to have children. While the petitioners surmise that the assailed law seeks to charge couples with the duty to have children only if they would raise them in a truly humane way, a deeper look into its provisions shows that what the law seeks to do is to simply <b>provide priority</b> to the poor in the implementation of government programs to promote basic reproductive health care.<br><br>With respect to the exclusion of private educational institutions from the mandatory reproductive health education program under Section 14, suffice it to state that the mere fact that the children of those who are less fortunate attend public educational institutions does not amount to substantial distinction sufficient to annul the assailed provision. On the other hand, substantial distinction rests between public educational institutions and private educational institutions, particularly because there is a need to recognize the academic freedom of private educational institutions especially with respect to religious instruction and to consider their sensitivity towards the teaching of reproductive health education.<br><br><b>8-<u>Involuntary Servitude</u></b><br><br>The petitioners also aver that the RH Law is constitutionally infirm as it violates the constitutional prohibition against involuntary servitude. They posit that Section 17 of the assailed legislation requiring private and non-government health care service providers to render forty-eight (48) hours of <i>pro bono</i> reproductive health services, actually amounts to involuntary servitude because it requires medical practitioners to perform acts against their will.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[262]</sup><br><br>The OSG counters that the rendition of <i>pro bono</i> services envisioned in Section 17 can hardly be considered as forced labor analogous to slavery, as reproductive health care service providers have the discretion as to the manner and time of giving <i>pro bono</i> services. Moreover, the OSG points out that the imposition is within the powers of the government, the accreditation of medical practitioners with PhilHealth being a privilege and not a right.<br><br>The point of the OSG is well-taken.<br><br>It should first be mentioned that the practice of medicine is undeniably imbued with public interest that it is both a power and a duty of the State to control and regulate it in order to protect and promote the public welfare. Like the legal profession, the practice of medicine is not a right but a privileged burdened with conditions as it directly involves the very lives of the people. A <i>fortiori</i>, this power includes the power of Congress<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[263]</sup> to prescribe the qualifications for the practice of professions or trades which affect the public welfare, the public health, the public morals, and the public safety; and to regulate or control such professions or trades, even to the point of revoking such right altogether.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[264]</sup><br><br>Moreover, as some petitioners put it, the notion of involuntary servitude connotes the presence of force, threats, intimidation or other similar means of coercion and compulsion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[265]</sup> A reading of the assailed provision, however, reveals that it only <i>encourages </i>private and non-government reproductive healthcare service providers to render pro bono service. Other than non-accreditation with PhilHealth, no penalty is imposed should they choose to do otherwise. Private and non-government reproductive healthcare service providers also enjoy the liberty to choose which kind of health service they wish to provide, when, where and how to provide it or whether to provide it all. Clearly, therefore, no compulsion, force or threat is made upon them to render pro bono service against their will. While the rendering of such service was made a prerequisite to accreditation with PhilHealth, the Court does not consider the same to be an unreasonable burden, but rather, a necessary incentive imposed by Congress in the furtherance of a perceived legitimate state interest.<br><br>Consistent with what the Court had earlier discussed, however, it should be emphasized that conscientious objectors are exempt from this provision as long as their religious beliefs and convictions do not allow them to render reproductive health service, <i>pro bono</i> or otherwise.<br><br><center><b>9-<u>Delegation of Authority to the FDA</u></b></center><br>The petitioners likewise question the delegation by Congress to the FDA of the power to determine whether or not a supply or product is to be included in the Essential Drugs List <i>(EDL)</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[266]</sup><br><br>The Court finds nothing wrong with the delegation. The FDA does not only have the power but also the competency to evaluate, register and cover health services and methods. It is the only government entity empowered to render such services and highly proficient to do so. It should be understood that health services and methods fall under the gamut of terms that are associated with what is ordinarily understood as “health products.” In this connection, Section 4 of R.A. No. 3720, as amended by R.A. No. 9711 reads:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 4. To carry out the provisions of this Act, there is hereby created an office to be called the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the Department of Health (DOH). Said Administration shall be under the Office of the Secretary and shall have the following functions, powers and duties:<br><br>"(a) To administer the effective implementation of this Act and of the rules and regulations issued pursuant to the same;<br><br>"(b) To assume primary jurisdiction in the collection of samples of health products;<br><br>"(c) <b>To analyze and inspect health products</b> in connection with the implementation of this Act;<br><br>"(d) To establish analytical data to serve as basis for the preparation of health products standards, and to recommend standards of identity, purity, safety, efficacy, quality and fill of container;<br><br>"(e) To issue certificates of compliance with technical requirements to serve as basis for the issuance of appropriate authorization and spot-check for compliance with regulations regarding operation of manufacturers, importers, exporters, distributors, wholesalers, drug outlets, and other establishments and facilities of health products, as determined by the FDA;<br><br>"x x x<br><br>"(h) <b>To conduct appropriate tests on all applicable health products prior to the issuance of appropriate authorizations to ensure safety, efficacy, purity, and quality;</b><br><br>"(i) To require all manufacturers, traders, distributors, importers, exporters, wholesalers, retailers, consumers, and non-consumer users of health products to report to the FDA any incident that reasonably indicates that said product has caused or contributed to the death, serious illness or serious injury to a consumer, a patient, or any person;<br><br>"(j) To issue cease and desist orders <i>motu propio</i> or upon verified complaint for health products, whether or not registered with the FDA <i>Provided</i>, That for registered health products, the cease and desist order is valid for thirty (30) days and may be extended for sixty (60) days only after due process has been observed;<br><br>"(k) <b>After due process, to order the ban, recall, and/or withdrawal of any health product found to have caused death, serious illness or serious injury to a consumer or patient, or is found to be imminently injurious, unsafe, dangerous, or grossly deceptive</b>, and to require all concerned to implement the risk management plan which is a requirement for the issuance of the appropriate authorization;<br><br>x x x.<br></blockquote><br>As can be gleaned from the above, the functions, powers and duties of the FDA are specific to enable the agency to carry out the mandates of the law. Being the country’s premiere and sole agency that ensures the safety of food and medicines available to the public, the FDA was equipped with the necessary powers and functions to make it effective. Pursuant to the principle of necessary implication, the mandate by Congress to the FDA to ensure public health and safety by permitting only food and medicines that are safe includes “service” and “methods.” From the declared policy of the RH Law, it is clear that Congress intended that the public be given only those medicines that are proven medically safe, legal, non-abortifacient, and effective in accordance with scientific and evidence-based medical research standards. The philosophy behind the permitted delegation was explained in <i>Echagaray v. Secretary of Justice</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[267]</sup> as follows:<br><br><blockquote>The reason is the increasing complexity of the task of the government and the growing inability of the legislature to cope directly with the many problems demanding its attention. The growth of society has ramified its activities and created peculiar and sophisticated problems that the legislature cannot be expected reasonably to comprehend. Specialization even in legislation has become necessary. To many of the problems attendant upon present day undertakings, the legislature may not have the competence, let alone the interest and the time, to provide the required direct and efficacious, not to say specific solutions.</blockquote><br><b>10- <u>Autonomy of Local Governments and the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM)</u></b><br><br>As for the autonomy of local governments, the petitioners claim that the RH Law infringes upon the powers devolved to local government units <i>(LGUs)</i> under Section 17 of the Local Government Code. Said Section 17 vested upon the LGUs the duties and functions pertaining to the delivery of basic services and facilities, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 17. Basic Services and Facilities. –<br><br>(a) Local government units shall endeavor to be self-reliant and shall continue exercising the powers and discharging the duties and functions currently vested upon them. They shall also discharge the functions and responsibilities of national agencies and offices devolved to them pursuant to this Code. Local government units shall likewise exercise such other powers and discharge such other functions and responsibilities as are necessary, appropriate, or incidental to efficient and effective provision of the basic services and facilities enumerated herein.<br><br>(b) Such basic services and facilities include, but are not limited to, x x x.</blockquote><br>While the aforementioned provision charges the LGUs to take on the functions and responsibilities that have already been devolved upon them from the national agencies on the aspect of providing for basic services and facilities in their respective jurisdictions, <b>paragraph (c) of the same provision provides a categorical exception of cases involving nationally-funded projects, facilities, programs and services</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[268]</sup> Thus:<br><br><blockquote>(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) hereof, <b>public works and infrastructure projects and other facilities, programs and services <u>funded by the National Government</u></b> under the annual General Appropriations Act, other special laws, pertinent executive orders, and those wholly or partially funded from foreign sources, <b>are not covered under this Section, except in those cases where the local government unit concerned is duly designated as the implementing agency</b> for such projects, facilities, programs and services. [Emphases supplied]</blockquote><br>The essence of this express reservation of power by the national government is that, unless an LGU is particularly designated as the implementing agency, it has no power over a program for which funding has been provided by the national government under the annual general appropriations act, even if the program involves the delivery of basic services within the jurisdiction of the LGU.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[269]</sup> A complete relinquishment of central government powers on the matter of providing basic facilities and services cannot be implied as the Local Government Code itself weighs against it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[270]</sup><br><br>In this case, a reading of the RH Law clearly shows that whether it pertains to the establishment of health care facilities,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[271]</sup> the hiring of skilled health professionals,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[272]</sup> or the training of barangay health workers,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[273]</sup> it will be the <b>national government</b> that will provide for the funding of its implementation. Local autonomy is not absolute. The national government still has the say when it comes to national priority programs which the local government is called upon to implement like the RH Law.<br><br>Moreover, from the use of the word “endeavor,” the LGUs are merely encouraged to provide these services. There is nothing in the wording of the law which can be construed as making the availability of these services mandatory for the LGUs. For said reason, it cannot be said that the RH Law amounts to an undue encroachment by the national government upon the autonomy enjoyed by the local governments.<br><br><i>The ARMM</i><br><br>The fact that the RH Law does not intrude in the autonomy of local governments can be equally applied to the ARMM. The RH Law does not infringe upon its autonomy. Moreover, Article III, Sections 6, 10 and 11 of R.A. No. 9054, or the organic act of the ARMM, alluded to by petitioner <i>Tillah</i> to justify the exemption of the operation of the RH Law in the autonomous region, refer to the policy statements for the guidance of the regional government. These provisions relied upon by the petitioners simply delineate the powers that may be exercised by the regional government, which can, in no manner, be characterized as an abdication by the State of its power to enact legislation that would benefit the general welfare. After all, despite the veritable autonomy granted the ARMM, the Constitution and the supporting jurisprudence, as they now stand, reject the notion of <i>imperium et imperio</i> in the relationship between the national and the regional governments.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[274]</sup> Except for the express and implied limitations imposed on it by the Constitution, Congress cannot be restricted to exercise its inherent and plenary power to legislate on all subjects which extends to all matters of general concern or common interest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[275]</sup><br><br><center><b>11 - <u>Natural Law</u></b></center><br><br>With respect to the argument that the RH Law violates natural law,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[276]</sup> suffice it to say that the Court does not duly recognize it as a legal basis for upholding or invalidating a law. Our only guidepost is the Constitution. While every law enacted by man emanated from what is perceived as natural law, the Court is not obliged to see if a statute, executive issuance or ordinance is in conformity to it. To begin with, it is not enacted by an acceptable legitimate body. Moreover, natural laws are mere thoughts and notions on inherent rights espoused by theorists, philosophers and theologists. The jurists of the philosophical school are interested in the law as an abstraction, rather than in the actual law of the past or present.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[277]</sup> Unless, a natural right has been transformed into a written law, it cannot serve as a basis to strike down a law. In <i>Republic v. Sandiganbayan</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[278]</sup> the very case cited by the petitioners, it was explained that the Court is not duty-bound to examine every law or action and whether it conforms with both the Constitution and natural law. Rather, natural law is to be used sparingly only in the most peculiar of circumstances involving rights inherent to man where no law is applicable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[279]</sup><br><br>At any rate, as earlier expounded, the RH Law does not sanction the taking away of life. It does not allow abortion in any shape or form. It only seeks to enhance the population control program of the government by providing information and making non-abortifacient contraceptives more readily available to the public, especially to the poor.<br><br><i>Facts and Fallacies<br>and the Wisdom of the Law</i><br><br>In general, the Court does not find the RH Law as unconstitutional insofar as it seeks to provide access to medically-safe, non-abortifacient, effective, legal, affordable, and quality reproductive healthcare services, methods, devices, and supplies. As earlier pointed out, however, the religious freedom of some sectors of society cannot be trampled upon in pursuit of what the law hopes to achieve. After all, the Constitutional safeguard to religious freedom is a recognition that man stands accountable to an authority higher than the State.<br><br>In conformity with the principle of separation of Church and State, one religious group cannot be allowed to impose its beliefs on the rest of the society. Philippine modern society leaves enough room for diversity and pluralism. As such, everyone should be tolerant and open-minded so that peace and harmony may continue to reign as we exist alongside each other.<br><br>As healthful as the intention of the RH Law may be, the idea does not escape the Court that what it seeks to address is the problem of rising poverty and unemployment in the country. Let it be said that the cause of these perennial issues is not the large population but the unequal distribution of wealth. Even if population growth is controlled, poverty will remain as long as the country’s wealth remains in the hands of the very few.<br><br>At any rate, population control may not be beneficial for the country in the long run. The European and Asian countries, which embarked on such a program generations ago, are now burdened with ageing populations. The number of their young workers is dwindling with adverse effects on their economy. These young workers represent a significant human capital which could have helped them invigorate, innovate and fuel their economy. These countries are now trying to reverse their programs, but they are still struggling. For one, Singapore, even with incentives, is failing.<br><br>And in this country, the economy is being propped up by remittances from our Overseas Filipino Workers. This is because we have an ample supply of young able-bodied workers. What would happen if the country would be weighed down by an ageing population and the fewer younger generation would not be able to support them? This would be the situation when our total fertility rate would go down below the replacement level of two (2) children per woman.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[280]</sup><br><br>Indeed, at the present, the country has a population problem, but the State should not use coercive measures (like the penal provisions of the RH Law against conscientious objectors) to solve it. Nonetheless, the policy of the Court is non-interference in the wisdom of a law.<br><br><blockquote>x x x. But this Court cannot go beyond what the legislature has laid down. Its duty is to say what the law is as enacted by the lawmaking body. That is not the same as saying what the law should be or what is the correct rule in a given set of circumstances. <b>It is not the province of the judiciary to look into the wisdom of the law nor to question the policies adopted by the legislative branch. Nor is it the business of this Tribunal to remedy every unjust situation that may arise from the application of a particular law. It is for the legislature to enact remedial legislation if that would be necessary in the premises</b>. But as always, with apt judicial caution and cold neutrality, the Court must carry out the delicate function of interpreting the law, guided by the Constitution and existing legislation and mindful of settled jurisprudence. The Court's function is therefore limited, and accordingly, must confine itself to the judicial task of saying what the law is, as enacted by the lawmaking body.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[281]</sup></blockquote><br>Be that as it may, it bears reiterating that the RH Law is a mere compilation and <i>enhancement</i> of the prior existing contraceptive and reproductive health laws, but with coercive measures. Even if the Court decrees the RH Law as entirely unconstitutional, there will still be the Population Act (R.A. No. 6365), the Contraceptive Act (R.A. No. 4729) and the reproductive health for women or The Magna Carta of Women (R.A. No. 9710), sans the coercive provisions of the assailed legislation. All the same, the principle of “no-abortion” and “non-coercion” in the adoption of any family planning method should be maintained.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petitions are<b> PARTIALLY GRANTED</b>.

No. 10354 is an anti-poor program that seeks to reduce the population of the poor?</li><li>How is the second paragraph of the same section related to the proposition that R.A. No. 10354 encourages sex among minors?</li><li>In relation to Section 23 on Prohibited Acts, where in the law can you find the definition of the term ‘health care service provider’? Is the definition of a ‘public health care service provider’ found in Section 4, paragraph (n) of the law sufficient for the Court to understand the meaning of a ‘private health care service provider’ or should the Court refer to the Implementing Rules and Regulations which refer to ‘health care providers’?</li><li>With respect to ‘health care providers’ under the Implementing Rules and Regulations, does it make a difference that they are called ‘health care providers’ and not ‘health care service providers’? Does the fact that there is a missing word indicate that there is a difference or that the tautology being proposed actually refers to different objects? If in the affirmative, is there enough basis to say that the law is a criminal statute that has sufficient definitions for purposes of punitive action?</li><li>In relation to Section 23(a)(1), how will the State be able to locate the programs and services on which the health care service provider has the duty to give information? If the terminology of ‘health care service provider’ includes ‘private health care service provider’, which includes private hospitals and private doctors, is the State duty-bound to consequently provide these providers with information on the programs and services that these providers should give information on?</li><li>As regards programs, is there a duty on the part of the State to provide a way by which private health care service providers can have access to information on reproductive health care programs as defined in Section 4, paragraph (r)? What is the implication of the fact that the law requires even private parties with the duty to provide information on government programs on the criminal liability of private health care service providers?</li><li>As regards services, what is the distinction between ‘information’ and ‘services’ considering that ‘services’ in different portions of the statute include providing of information?</li><li>What are the specific elements of every sub-group of crime in Section 23 and what are the legal bases for the determination of each element?</li><li>Are there existing provisions in other statutes relevant to the legal definitions found in R.A. No. 10354?</li><li>Why is there an exemption for the religious or conscientious objector in paragraph (3) of Section 23 and not in paragraphs (1) and (2)? What is the distinction between paragraph (3) and paragraphs (1) and (2)?</li><li>Section 23(a)(3) penalizes refusal to extend quality health care services and information ‘on account of the person’s marital status, gender, age, religious convictions, personal circumstances, or nature of work.’ What if the refusal is not on account of one’s marital status, gender, age, religious convictions, personal circumstances, or nature of work, or what if the refuser simply does not state the reason for the refusal? Will there still be a criminal liability under Section 23(a)(3)?</li><li>Still on Section (23)(a)(3) on referring a person to another facility or provider, is this the same or analogous to referral of a person to seek second opinion? What is the medical standard for the provision of a second opinion? In referring to another professional or service provider for a second opinion, is it the patient who is not comfortable with the opinion given by the first doctor that triggers the duty or option to refer? How is it different with the situation in Section 23(a)(3) when it is the doctor who is not comfortable about giving an opinion? Is the difference legally material?</li><li>How does Section 23, paragraph (c) relate to Article 134 the Labor Code which requires employers to provide family planning services?</li><li>Section 24 provides that in case the offender is a juridical person, the penalties in the statute shall be imposed on the president or any responsible officer. For each offense in Section 23, how will the corporate officer be made responsible if there is no actual participation by the hospital board directors or officers of such action? Does Section 24 in relation to Section 23 require corporate action? What is the situation being contemplated in the second paragraph of Section 24 before there can be accountability for criminal violations?</li><li>Section 7 provides that access of minors to information and family planning services must be with the written consent of parents or guardians. Is there a penalty in the law for those who will make these information and services (e.g., contraceptives) available to minors without the parent’s consent? How does this relate to Section 14 which requires the Department of Education to formulate a curriculum which ‘shall be used by public schools’ and ‘may be adopted by private schools’? Is there a penalty for teaching sex education without the parents’ or guardians’ written consent? Correlatively, is there a penalty for private schools which do not teach sex education as formulated by the DepEd considering the use of the word ‘may’?</li></ol><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> Section 1, R.A.

Ayon dito, pantay na pangangalagaan ng pamahalaan ang buhay ng ina at ang buhay na kanyang dinadala.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Bakas sa adhikaing ito ang pagkilala sa malaking bahaging ginagampanan ng ina sa pagbibigay ng buhay.<br><br>Kaya't sasalungatin ko ang bigkasin ng aking mga kapatid na Mahistrado, na ang pagpapalaya sa pasiya ng may-katawan ay kumikitil ng buhay ng kapwa-taong isisilang pa lamang. Wala sa takda ng Saligang Batas at Republic Act No. 10354 (<i>The Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012</i>), o RH Law, ang pagkitil ng buhay. Nguni't inuunawa rin nito ang karapatan ng mag-asawa na magpalaki ng kanilang pamilya ng may dangal sa buhay. Napakahalaga din sa pananaw ng Saligang Batas at ng RH Law ang kalusugan ng pamayanan, lalong-lalo na ang kalusugan ng mga ina o magiging ina ng pamayanang ito. Kaya't mahalaga na ang bawat interpretasyon ng RH Law ay ayon sa ikabubuti ng pamilyang Pilipino at kalusugan ng ina.<br><br>Naitakda na sa Saligang Batas, at alinsunod naman dito ang RH Law, na ang buhay ay pangangalagaan mula sa <i>conception</i>. Kung ano ang puntong iyon ay katanungan para sa mga dalubhasa ng siyensiya, at hindi para sa Korte Suprema. Mayroong prosesong naitakda ang RH Law kung saan kinikilala ang pangunahing kapangyarihan ng Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sa pagsusuri sa mga katangian ng isang metodo o gamot upang alamin kung ito ay gagamitin sa pagkitil ng buhay na pinagbabawal ng Saligang Batas. Maaari lamang saklawan ng Korte Suprema ang tanong na ito kung ang prosesong legal ay lumabag sa mga alituntunin ng <i>due process</i> at mga kaakibat na <i>procedural rules</i> nito. Sukdulang panghihimasok ang magtakda kami sa panahong ito kung ang mga <i>hormonal contraceptives</i> ay <i>abortifacient</i> o hindi.<br><br>Gayundin, ang may-katawan na daraan sa paglilihi, pagbubuntis at maaaring ikapeligro ng sariling buhay ay nararapat na pakinggan ng pamahalaan. Maaaring imungkahi ng kapamilya, kasama na ng kanyang asawa, ang alternatibong paraan upang harapin ang sitwasyong pangkalusugan. Nguni't sa bandang huli, ang pasiya ng may-katawan ang dapat manaig. At bagama't ang may-katawan ay wala pa sa hustong gulang, kung siya ay nabuntis na, hindi dapat hadlangan ang kanyang kakayahang humingi ng tulong ukol sa<i> reproductive health</i> kahit walang pahintulot ng kanyang magulang sapagka't nakasalalay sa ganitong kakayahan ang kanyang kalusugan at mismong buhay.<br><br>Sa panig ng mga matataas na nanunungkulan sa pamahalaan na inatasang magpatupad ng RH Law, hindi nararapat na sila ay hayaang lumabag sa katungkulang ito. Binigyan sila ng kapangyarihan ng pamahalaan upang ipatupad ang mga batas, at hindi nila maaaring gamitin ang nasabing kapangyarihan upang biguin ang mga nilalayon ng pamahalaan para sa mga mamamayan, lalo na't ang mga layuning ito ay kaugnay sa usaping pangkalusugan.<br><br>Sinusuportahan ng RH Law ang pagsulong at pangangalaga sa karapatan ng kababaihan. Ang pagkakaloob ng mabisa at mahusay na <i>reproductive health care services </i>ay ayon sa layunin nitong masiguro ang kalusugan ng mag-ina, at makapagtatag ng sapat na pamantayan alang-alang sa kapakanan ng Iahat.<br><br>Hindi maikakaila na ang paulit-ulit na pagbanggit sa mga katagang <i>"medically-safe, non-abortifacient, effective, legal, affordable and quality reproductive health care services, methods, devices and supplies"</i> sa RH Law ay di-pangkaraniwang pagpapahalaga sa buhay ng tao at ang sadyang pagwawaksi sa abortion bilang isang krimen na may karampatang parusa ayon sa ating batas.<br><br><u>Ang Pasanin ng <i>Petitioners</i></u><br><br>Pinapalagay bilang isang paunang pag-unawa, na ang lahat ng batas ay hindi labag sa Saligang Batas o konstitusyonal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Ito ay pangunahing prinsipyo na matagal nang kinikilala, kung kaya't iniiwasan ng Korte Suprema na ipawalang-bisa ang isang batas<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> bilang pagkilala sa dunong, dangal at kabayanihan ng Kongreso na gumawa nito, at sa Pangulo na nagpatibay dito.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Ang tungkuling magpatupad ng Saligang Batas ay hindi natatangi sa Korte Suprema; ito ay kaakibat na katungkulan ng Kongreso at ng Pangulo.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Dahil ang lahat ng batas ay ipinapalagay na konstitusyonal, ang sinuman na dudulog sa Korte Suprema upang ipawalang-bisa ito ay mabigat ang susuungin.

Sa palagay ko, hindi akma ang paggamit ng <i>technical legal test</i> na<i> compelling state interest</i> sa kasong hinaharap natin.<br><br>Hindi ako sumasang-ayon na nararapat gamitin ang <i>compelling state interest test </i>upang tiyakin ang legalidad ng RH Law - partikular na ang paggarantiya ng pamahalaan sa ligtas, mabisa, abot-kaya, de-kalidad, naaayon sa batas at hindi<i> abortifacient</i> na <i>reproductive health care services, methods , devices </i>at <i>supplies </i>para sa lahat, pati na ang mahalagang kaalaman ukol dito - sa kadahilanang buo ang pagkilala ng RH Law sa religious freedom, kaya 't hindi na kailangan ang test na ito. Sa <i>Estrada v. Escritor</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> ipinaliwanag natin na:<br><br><blockquote>The "compelling state interest" test is proper where conduct is involved for the whole gamut of human conduct has different effects on the state's interests: some effects may be immediate and short-term while others delayed and far-reaching. A test that would protect the interests of the state in preventing a substantive evil, whether immediate or delayed, is therefore necessary. However, not any interest of the state would suffice to prevail over the right to religious freedom as this is a fundamental right that enjoys a preferred position in the hierarchy of rights - "the most inalienable and sacred of all human rights," in the words of Jefferson. This right is sacred for an invocation of the Free Exercise Clause is an appeal to a higher sovereignty. The entire constitutional order of limited government is premised upon an acknowledgment of such higher sovereignty, thus the Filipinos implore the "aid of Almighty God in order to build a just and humane society and establish a government." As held in <i>Sherbert,</i> only the gravest abuses, endangering paramount interests can limit this fundamental right. A mere balancing of interests which balances a right with just a colorable state interest is therefore not appropriate. Instead, only a compelling interest of the state can prevail over the fundamental right to religious liberty. The test requires the state to carry a heavy burden, a compelling one, for to do otherwise would allow the state to batter religion, especially the less powerful ones until they are destroyed. <b>In determining which shall prevail between the state's interest and religious liberty, reasonableness shall be the guide. The "compelling state interest" serves the purpose of revering religious liberty while at the same time affording protection to the paramount interests of the state.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> (Emphasis ours)</blockquote><br>Ginamit ang <i>compelling state interest test</i> sa <i>Estrada v. Escritor</i> upang malaman kung ang respondent doon ay nararapat na bigyan ng <i>exemption</i> laban sa kasong administratibo bunga ng pakikisama niya sa lalaking hindi niya asawa ayon sa <i>Civil Code.</i> Karaniwan, bilang kawani ng pamahalaan, mahaharap ang respondent sa kasong <i>disgraceful and immoral conduct. </i>Bagkus, inilahad ng <i>respondent</i> na bagama't walang basbas ng pamahalaang sibil ang kanilang pagsasama, may basbas naman ito ng kanilang relihiyon na <i>Jehovah's Witnesses and the Watch Tower and Bible Tract Society</i>. Kaya't hindi siya nararapat na sampahan ng kasong administratibo bunga nito.<br><br>Sa kadahilanang aminado naman ang<i> Solicitor General</i> na tunay at tapat ang paniniwala ng <i>respondent </i>sa kaniyang relihiyon, at nagdudulot ng ligalig sa kanyang paniniwala ang banta ng <i>disciplinary action</i> bunga ng kasong disgraceful and <i>immoral conduct,</i> nagpasiya ang Korte Suprema na nararapat na patunayan ng pamahalaan kung tunay nga na may <i>compelling secular objective </i>na nagbunsod dito upang hindi payagan ang pakikisama ng respondent sa lalaking hindi niya asawa. Nararapat din, ayon sa Korte Suprema, na ipakita ng pamahalaan na gumamit ito ng <i>least restrictive means</i> sa pagpigil ng karapatan ng mga tao sa pagtatanggol nito ng <i>compelling state interest.</i><br><br>Ukol dito, inihayag ng Korte Suprema na <i>"the government must do more than assert the objectives at risk if exemption is given; it must precisely show how and to what extent those objectives will be undermined if exemptions are granted</i>. "<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Sa kalaunan, bigo ang pamahalaan na patunayan ang pakay nito sa pagbabawal sa relasyon ng <i>respondent. </i>Bunsod nito, binigyan ng <i>exemption</i> sa parusa ang respondent batay sa kanyang <i>religious freedom.</i><br><br>Malinaw sa<i> Estrada v. Escritor</i> na sa ilalim ng <i>compelling state interest test</i>, ipinagtutunggali ang religious freedom ng mga mamamayan at ang interes ng pamahalaan sa pagpapatupad ng patakarang sinasabing nagpapahirap sa <i>religious convictions </i>ng ilan. Kapag hindi nanaig ang interes ng pamahalaan, magbibigay ng exemption sa patakaran ang Korte Suprema para sa mga mamamayang naninindigan para sa kanilang <i>religious freedom.</i> Isinaad din sa <i>Estrada v. Escritor</i> na nakagawian na ng Korte Suprema na magbigay ng <i>exemption</i> sa halip na magpawalang-bisa ng mga patakaran ng pamahalaan pagdating sa usapin ng <i>religious freedom.</i><br><br>Hindi ito ang sitwasyon sa ilalim ng RH Law. Ayon sa petitioners, katumbas ng isang pagkakasala sa ilalim ng kanilang relihiyon ang pagsasagawa ng serbisyo ukol sa <i>modern family planning methods </i>at pagbibigay ng payo ukol dito. Labag ito sa <i>religious freedom</i> ng mga <i>conscientious health professionals</i> na naniniwalang likas na masama ang contraception. Dahil dito, nararapat na ipawalang-bisa ang RH Law. At, ayon sa mga kapatid kong Mahistrado, walang compelling state interest para payagan ang pamahalaang pilitin ang<i> health professionals</i> na lumabag sa kanilang paniniwala. Ang totoo, walang paglabag sa paniniwala na pinapataw ang RH Law.<br><br><u>Ang <i>Opt-Out Clause</i></u><br><br>Nakalimutan ng petitioners ang kabuuan ng RH Law. Batid ng Kongreso na maaaring makasagasa sa paniniwala at ikaligalig ng ilang <i>medical professionals</i> ang kautusang ito sa RH Law. Dahil mismo dito kaya nag-ukit ang Kongreso ng <i>exemption</i> sa RH Law para sa mga<i> conscientious objectors </i>sa pamamagitan ng <i>"opt-out clause.</i> " Sa ilalim ng opt-out clause na nakapaloob sa <i>Section</i> 7 ng RH Law, hindi obligadong magdulot ng serbisyo kaugnay sa <i>modern family planning methods </i>ang mga<i> non­ maternity specialty hospitals</i> at mga ospital na pagmamay-ari at pinatatakbo ng mga <i>religious groups</i>. Sa kabilang banda, pinahahalagahan sa ilalim ng Section 23(a)(3) ng RH Law ang conscientious objection ng <i>health care service providers </i>batay sa kanilang ethical o <i>religious beliefs.</i> Ayon dito, exempted sila sa kaparusahan na ipapataw sa mga tatangging magdulot ng reproductive health care services at magbigay ng mahalagang kaalaman ukol dito.<br><br>Samakatuwid, hindi na nararapat na gamitin pa ang compelling state interest test upang matiyak ang legalidad ng RH Law. Matatandaang sa ilalim ng compelling state interest test, kailangang ipakita ng pamahalaan kung paano mawawalan ng saysay ang mga layunin nito sa pagbuo ng RH Law kung magbibigay ito ng exemptions sa mga itinatakda ng batas. Ngunit dahil kinilala na ng RH Law ang religious freedom ng mga <i>conscientious objectors</i> sa pamamagitan ng <i>exemption</i> na naka-ukit na dito, wala na sa pamahalaan ang pasanin upang ipagtanggol ang interes nito sa pagsisikap na mapangalagaan ang reproductive health ng mga mamamayan.<br><br>Naging sensitibo ang Kongreso sa paniniwala ng mga conscientious objectors sa pamamagitan ng paglalatag ng <i>exemptions</i> sa RH Law. Sa puntong ito, kung kakailanganin pa ng Kongreso na patunayan ang <i>compelling state interest</i>, mawawalan ng saysay ang respeto sa isa't isa na iniaatas ng ating Saligang Batas sa mga magigiting na sangay ng pamahalaan.<br><br>Ang agarang pagturo na lamang sa pinakamalapit na <i>health facility</i> o<i> health care service provider </i>sa mga pasyenteng naghahangad ng serbisyo ukol sa <i>modern family planning methods</i> ang nalalabing katungkulan ng mga conscientious objectors, ng mga <i>non-maternity specialty hospitals</i>, at mga ospital na pagmamay-ari at pinatatakbo ng mga religious groups. Ito ay upang malaman ng pasyente kung saan siya tutungo at upang hindi naman sila mapagkaitan ng serbisyong inihahandog ng pamahalaan para mapangalagaan ang kanilang reproductive health.<br><br>Ayon sa <i>Solicitor General</i>:<br><br><blockquote>74. The duty to refer, as an "opt out" clause, is a carefully balanced compromise between, on one hand, the interests of the religious objector who is allowed to keep silent but is required to refer and, on the other, the citizen who needs access to information and who has the right to expect that the health care professional in front of her will act professionally. The concession given by the State under Section 7 and 23(a)(3) is sufficient accommodation to the right to freely exercise one's religion without wmecessarily infringing on the rights of others.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></blockquote><br>Ayaw magpadala ng mga<i> petitioners.</i> Giit nila, labag pa rin sa kanilang <i>religious freedom </i>ang pag-aatas ng<i> duty to refer</i>. Sang-ayon dito ang Decision at nagsaad ito na ang <i>opt-out clause</i> ay isang ''f<i>alse compromise because it makes pro-life health providers complicit in the performance of an act that they find morally repugnant or offensive."</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Ayon sa paninindigang ito, ang pagturo sa pasyente sa ibang pinakamalapit na<i> health facility</i> o <i>health care service provider</i> na makatutulong sa kanila ay kahalintulad na kaagad ng contraception, ang bagay na kanilang itinuturing na likas na masama. Totoo naman na maaaring puntahan nga ng pasyente ang itinurong<i> health facility</i> o <i>health care service provider</i> at doon ay makakuha ito ng serbisyo ukol sa <i>modern family planning methods </i>na makasalanan sa paningin ng <i>conscientious objector. </i>Nguni't bunga lamang ng pagsasanib ng napakaraming posibilidad ang resultang ito.<br><br>Maaaring magpasiya ang pasyente na hindi na lang kumunsulta, o kaya ay pumunta ito sa<i> health facility </i>o <i>health care service provider </i>na iba sa itinuro sa kanya ng conscientious objector. Maaari ding magpayo ang naiturong <i>health facility</i> o<i> health care service provider</i> na hindi hiyang o nararapat sa pasyente ang<i> modern family planning methods</i> dahil sa kundisyon ng kanyang pangangatawan. Maaaring pagkatapos ng lahat ng pagpapayo, pagpapatingin at paghahanda ukol sa gagawing<i> modern family planning method </i>o<i> procedure </i>ay magpasiya ang pasyente na huwag na lang ituloy ang lahat ng ito.<br><br>Isa lamang sa maraming posibilidad ang kinatatakutang resulta ng mga <i>petitioners</i>, at gayunpaman, hindi huling hakbang na maghahatid sa pasyente tungo sa <i>contraception</i> ang pagtuturo sa ibang <i>health facility o health care service provider.</i><br><br>Ayon sa Decision, walang idinudulot na paglabag sa religious freedom ang pag-uutos sa mga ikakasal na dumalo sa mga seminar ukol sa <i>responsible parenthood, family planning, breastfeeding</i> at<i> infant nutrition</i> dahil hindi naman sila obligadong sumunod sa mga ituturo dito. Hindi rin masama ang pagbibigay-daan na mabigyan ng mahalagang kaalaman tungkol sa <i>family planning services</i> ang mga menor de edad na may anak o nagkaroon ng miscarriage para matutunan nila ang mga bagay na makatutulong sa kanila upang pangalagaan ang kanilang katawan at anak o dinadala. Kung gayon, at kahalintulad ng nasabing sitwasyon, wala rin dapat pagtutol sa atas ng RH Law na ituro ng mga <i>conscientious objector</i> ang mga pasyente sa pinakamalapit na<i> health facility </i>o <i>health care service</i> provider na makatutulong sa kanila.<br><br>Ang pagpapahalaga sa<i> informed choice</i> ng mga Pilipino pagdating sa usapin ng<i> reproductive health </i>ang pundasyon ng RH Law. Mananatili ang pagpapasiya sa pasyente; hinihiling lamang na huwag hadlangan ng<i> conscientious objectors</i> ang kanilang daan tungo sa paggawa ng masusing pagpapasiya.<br><br>Kinikilala ng<i> International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</i> na ang religious freedom ay maaari ding mapasailalim sa mga <i>"limitations ... prescribed by law and ... necessary to protect public safety, order, health, or morals or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others. </i>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Bukod dito, hindi rin maikakaila na maaaring ipagbawal ng pamahalaan ang isang gawain kahit alinsunod pa ito sa religious convictions kung ito ay labag sa "<i>important social duties or subversive of good order. </i>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Sa kanilang pagpasok sa propesyon, tinanggap ng mga <i>medical professionals</i> ang mga moral <i>values</i> at kaakibat na katungkulan sa mga pasyente.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Isa dito ang napapanahong <i>duty to refer</i> sa ibang<i> health facility </i>o <i>health care service provider </i>kung batid nila na dahil sa kanilang <i>religious beliefs</i>, hindi nila maaaring ihatid ang serbisyong hinihingi o kinakailangan ng pasyente.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Upang mapanatili ang ethical practice, hinihikayat ng mga pantas ang mga <i>conscientious objectors </i>na maglingkod kalapit ang ibang <i>medical professionals</i> na hindi <i>conscientious objectors</i> upang maayos na mapanatili ang isang <i>referral system</i> para masigurado na maibibigay sa pasyente ang mga pangangailangan nitong hindi kayang tugunan ng <i>conscientious objector</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Mahalaga ito upang masiguro na tuloy-tuloy ang serbisyong pangkalusugan para sa mga taong nangangailangan nito.<br><br>Dahil dito, hindi maituturing na dagdag pasanin ng <i>medical professionals </i>ang<i> duty to refer </i>sa ilalim ng RH Law. Likas na ito sa kanilang propesyon. Sa katunayan, nasa kapangyarihan ng Kongreso ang maglatag ng mga alituntunin at dagdag na pasanin sa propesyon ng medisina ayon sa police power nito upang isulong ang public health. At, inuunawa ng RH Law na dahil sa <i>religious convictions</i>, hindi maaaring isagawa ng isang <i>medical professional</i> ang serbisyo ukol sa<i> modern family planning methods </i>kahit hinihingi pa ng pasyente. Dahil dito, pinapayagan sila na tumanggi ng pasyente at papuntahin ito sa ibang <i>medical professional</i> na makatutulong dito.<br><br>Kung tutuusin, maituturing na paglabag sa sinumpaang tungkulin ng mga<i> medical professionals </i>ang pagtangging magturo ng pasyente sa ibang<i> medical professional. </i>Maaari itong maging basehan ng <i>disciplinary action</i> laban sa kanila. Ayon sa isang lathalain, dahil ang mga medical professionals ay napapaloob sa isang monopoly sa paghahatid ng serbisyong pangkalusugan, ang ilan sa kanila na mas pinahahalagahan ang kanilang religious interests nang walang pakundangan sa kapakanan ng kanilang pasyente ay nababalot sa isang matinding <i>conflict of interest</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Kilala ang dakilang propesyong ito sa pagpapakasakit para sa ikabubuti ng ibang tao,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> kaya naman ang pagtanggi kahit sa pagtuturo na lamang sa ibang<i> health facility o health care service provider</i> ay maituturing na pagkait ng serbisyong pangkalusugan sa mga pasyente.<br><br>Upang mabigyan ng katumbas na proteksyon ang karapatan ng mga pasyente sa tuloy-tuloy na serbisyong pangkalusugan, minabuti ng Kongreso na patawan ng parusa ang mga conscientious objectors na tatangging tuparin man lamang ang <i>duty to refer</i>. Ipinataw ang parusa upang masiguro na hindi naman magagamit ng <i>conscientious medical professionals </i>ang <i>exemption</i> na ipinagkaloob sa kanila upang ipataw ang kanilang <i>religious beliefs </i>sa kanilang mga pasyente. Pinaiiral ito ng prinsipyong ang karapatan ng malayang pagsamba at pagpapahayag ng relihiyon ay nangangahulugan na walang karapatan ang sinuman na mang-api sa paniniwalang hindi ayon sa kanila.<br><br>Sa puntong ito, nais kong linawin na ipinagbabawal ng Section 23(a)(1) ang pagkakait ng mahalagang kaalaman, pagbabawal sa pagpapalaganap nito o sadyaang pagbibigay ng maling impormasyon kaugnay ng mga programa at serbisyo ukol sa<i> reproductive health</i>, karapatan ng lahat sa<i> informed choice</i> at ang paggarantiya ng pamahalaan sa ligtas, mabisa, abot-kaya, de-kalidad, naaayon sa batas at hindi <i>abortifacient</i> na <i>family planning methods.<br></i><br>Sa kabilang banda, ipinagbabawal naman ng <i>Section </i>23(a)(2) ang pagtangging magsagawa ng ligtas at naaayon sa batas na <i>reproductive health procedures </i>dahil lamang sa ang taong naghahangad nito, bagama't nasa hustong edad, ay hindi makapagpakita ng pahintulot ng kanyang asawa o magulang.

Gayundin, wala nang oportunidad ang mga <i>conscientious objectors </i>na tumangging magsagawa ng ligtas at naaayon sa batas na<i> reproductive health procedures</i> sa isang may-asawa o menor de edad dahil sa kakulangan ng pahintulot ng asawa o magulang.

Alalahanin ng lahat na pribilehiyo at hindi karapatan ang magkaroon ng PhilHealth accreditation kaya't tama lang na isukli ng <i>gynecologists</i> at <i>obstetricians</i> ang 48 oras na <i>pro bono service</i> sa maralita upang mapangalagaan ang kanilang <i>reproductive health.</i><br><br>Kung tutuusin, <i>reproductive health care</i> ng mga pasyente ang pangunahing pinagtutuunan ng pansin ng mga gynecologists at obstetricians. Kung bibigyan sila ng <i>exemption</i> sa <i>Section 17 </i>dahil <i>conscientious objector </i>sila, ang tanging magiging epekto nito ay hindi nila kakailanganing magbigay ng anumang libreng serbisyo. Kung gayon, mawawalan ng saysay ang layunin ng pamahalaan sa ilalim ng RH Law na ihatid sa mga maralitang mamamayan ang kadalubhasaan ng mga pribadong <i>reproductive health care service providers</i>.<br><br><u>Pahuling Pasabi</u><br><br>Walang pinapanigan ang Korte Suprema kundi ang Saligang Batas, at pinakinggan ang lahat ng dumulog dito sa usapin ng RH Law. Hati-hati ang opinyon pagdating sa <i>reproductive health</i> at <i>family planning</i>. Halimbawa, bagama't may mga pagtutol ang bahagi ng Simbahang Katolika sa reproductive health atfamily planning, itinuturing naman itong alinsunod sa mga aral ng Islam. Ayon safatwah na inilabas ng <i>Assembly of Darul-Iftah of the Philippines </i>kaugnay sa <i>reproductive health</i> at <i>family planning,</i> walang kasulatang napapaloob sa Qur'an na nagbabawal sa pagpigil at pag-aagwat sa pagbubuntis at pagbabawas sa dami ng anak.<br><br>Ayon din sa kanila, hindi salungat sa konsiyensiya ang <i>family planning</i>. Sa katunayan, itinataguyod ito ng Shariah. Itinakda ng Qur'an na kailangang pasusuhin ng ina ang sanggol hanggang ito ay dalawang taong gulang, at nagbabala ang Propeta laban sa pagpapasuso ng inang nagdadalang-tao. Malinaw dito ang layuning pag-aagwat ng pagbubuntis, kung saan kinakailangang hindi mabuntis ang ina sa loob ng dalawang taon na ito ay nagpapasuso.<br><br>Pinapayagan ang lahat ng methods of contraception hangga't ang mga ito ay ligtas, naaayon sa batas, aprobado ng <i>medical professionals</i> at alinsunod sa Islamic Shariah. Wala ring nakikitang pagtutol ang Shariah sa pakahulugan ng<i> International Conference on Population and Development sa reproductive health</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> patina ang mga prinsipyo nito ukol sa pagpapasiya sa dami at pag-aagwat ng mga anak, pagkakaroon ng kaalaman ukol sa sariling sekswalidad, pagiging ligtas sa mga sakit kaugnay sa reproduction, at pagkakaroon ng safe at <i>satisfying sex life</i> sa pagitan ng mag-asawa. Kung susukatin ang mga adhikain ng RH Law batay sa <i>religious freedom</i> ng mga Muslim, na bumubuo sa limang porsiyento ng mga Pilipino, wala itong hatid na ligalig o pasanin.<br><br>Sa likod ng karapatan sa malayang pagsamba at pagpapahayag ng relihiyon ay ang pagrespeto sa paniniwala ng iba. Hati-hati maging ang mga opinyon ng mga Katoliko pagdating sa <i>reproductive health </i>at <i>family planning</i>. Malaking bahagi ng mga Katoliko ang sumusuporta sa RH Law at mga layunin nito. Dahil dito, walang maituturing na iisang awtoridad pagdating sa usaping ito kundi ang Saligang Batas. Ito ang nag-iisang batayan na isasaalang-alang upang makarating ang Korte Suprema sa konklusyong makatarungan para sa lahat.<br><br><b>AKO AY SANG-AYON</b> sa <i>Decision</i> na ang <b><i>SECTIONS</i> 4(A), 9, 15, 17 AT 24 NG RH LAW AY HINDI LABAG SA SALIGANG BATAS.

However, my opinion is that at this stage, the Court is simply not competent to declare when human life begins, whether upon fertilization of the ovum or upon attachment of the fertilized ovum to the uterus wall. The issue of when life begins is a scientific and medical issue that cannot be decided by this Court without the proper hearing and evidence. This issue has not even been settled within the scientific and medical community.<br><br>R.A. No. 10354,. however, protects the ovum upon its fertilization without saying that life begins upon fertilization. This should be sufficient for purposes of resolving this case - for whether life begins upon fertilization or upon implantation of the fertilized ovum on the uterus wall, R.A. No. 10354 protects <b><i>both</i></b> asserted starting points of human life. Absent a definitive consensus from the scientific and medical community, this Court cannot vent.ure to pronounce which starting point of human life is correct. We can only reiterate what Section 12, Article II of the Constitution provides, that the State shall "equally protect the life of the mother and the life of the unborn from conception x x x."<br><br>Section 12, Article II of the Constitution is repeated in Section 2 of R.A. No. 10354. The law does not provide a definition of conception. However, the law is replete with provisions that embody the policy of the State to protect the travel of the fertilized ovum to the uterus wall. In fact, the law guarantees that the State will provide access only to "medically-safe, non-abortifacient, effective, legal,&nbsp; affordable, and quality reproductive health care services, methods, devices, supplies <b>which do not prevent the implantation of a fertilized ovum</b> as determined by the Food and Drug Administration."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> R.A.

My discussions on this point are likewise submitted to reply to the position of Mr. Justice Marvic Leonen that the petitions are not appropriate for the exercise of the Court’s power of judicial review.<br><br>I also agree with the <i>ponencia</i> that the Reproductive Health (<i>RH</i>) law protects and promotes the right to life by its continued prohibition on abortion and distribution of abortifacients. I exclude from this concurrence <b><i>Section 9 of the RH law and its Implementing Rules and Regulation (IRR)</i></b> which, in my view, fail in their fidelity to the constitutional commands and to those of the RH Law itself; for one, they fail to adopt the principle of double effect under Section 12, Article II of the 1987 Constitution (“<i>Section 12</i>”).<br><br>For these reasons, I cannot wholly agree that the RH Law is fully protective of the unborn from conception. I submit, too, that the Court should formulate <b><u>guidelines</u></b> on what the government can actually procure and distribute under the RH law, consistent with its authority under this law and Section 12, Article II to achieve the full protection the Constitution envisions.<br><br>I also agree that the challenge to Section 14 of the RH Law is premature. However, I submit my own views regarding the mandatory sex education in light of the natural and primary right of parents to raise their children according to their religious beliefs. My discussion on this topic also responds to the position of Mr. Justice Bienvenido Reyes that the challenge to the constitutionality is ripe and that the government has a compelling interest in enacting a mandatory sex education program.<br><br>Lastly, I find the RH law’s Section 23(a)(1), which penalizes healthcare providers who “knowingly withhold information or restrict the dissemination thereof, and/or intentionally provide incorrect information regarding programs and services on reproductive health” to be unconstitutional for violating the freedom of speech.<br><br>For easy reference and for convenience, this Opinion shall proceed under the following structure:<br><br><ol type="I"><li><b><u>Preliminary Considerations</u></b><br><br><ol type="A"><li>The petitions are <b>ripe for judicial review</b>: the fresh approach under the 1987 Constitution<br><br><ol type="a"><li>The Historical Context of Judicial Power<br><br></li><li>Analysis of Section 1, Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution.<br><br>b.1.

My approach is anchored on a <b>“fresh” look at the 1987 Constitution</b> and the innovations it introduced on the Judicial Department, specifically, on the expansion of the Court’s adjudicative “judicial power.”<br><br><b><ol type="a"><li><u>The Historical Context of Judicial Power</u>. </li></ol></b><br>The <b>1935 Constitution</b> mentioned the term “<b>judicial power</b>” but did not define it.&nbsp; The Constitution simply located the seat of this power <i>“in one Supreme Court and in such inferior courts as may be established by law.”</i><br><br>The <b>1973 Constitution</b>, for its part, did not substantially depart from the 1935 formulation; it merely repeated this same statement and incorporated part of what used to be another section in the 1935 Constitution into its Section 1. Thus, Section 1 of the Article on the Judicial Department of the 1973 Constitution provided:<br><br><blockquote>The Judicial power shall be vested in one Supreme Court and in such inferior courts as may be established by law. The National Assembly shall have the power to define, prescribe, and apportion the jurisdiction of the various courts, but may not deprive the Supreme Court of its jurisdiction over cases enumerated in Section five thereof.<br></blockquote><br>The <b>1987 Constitution</b>, in contrast with the preceding Constitutions, substantially fleshed out the meaning of “judicial power,” not only by confirming the meaning of the term as understood by jurisprudence up to that time, but by going beyond the accepted jurisprudential meaning of the term. The changes are readily apparent from a plain comparison of the provisions. The same Section 1 under Judicial Department (Article VIII) now reads:<br><br>The judicial power shall be vested in one Supreme Court and in such lower courts as may be established by law.<br><br><blockquote>Judicial power <b><u>includes</u><i> the duty of the courts of justice </i>to settle <i>actual controversies</i></b> involving <b><i>rights which are legally demandable and enforceable</i></b>, <u>AND</u> to determine whether or not there has been <b><i>a grave abuse of discretion</i></b> amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of <b><i>any branch or instrumentality of the Government.</i></b> (emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br><b>b. <u>Analysis of Section 1, Article VIII<br>of the 1987 Constitution</u>.</b><br><br>This simple comparison readily yields the reading – through the repetition of the sentence that both the 1935 and the 1973 Constitutions contained – that the 1987 Judiciary provisions retain the same “judicial power” that it enjoyed under the 1935 and the 1973 Constitutions.<br><br>In addition, the 1987 Constitution, through the 2nd paragraph of its Section 1, confirms that judicial power is wider than the power of adjudication that it traditionally carried (<i>by using the word “includes”</i>) and at the same time incorporated the basic<i> requirements for adjudication </i>in the traditional concept, namely, the presence of <i>“actual controversies,”</i> based on <i>“rights which are legally demandable and enforceable.”</i><br><br>The confirmation expressly mentions that the power is granted to <b><i>“courts of justice” </i></b>and, aside from being a power, is imposed as a <b><i>duty of the courts</i></b>. Thus, the Constitution now lays the courts open to the charge of failure to do their constitutional duty when and if they violate the obligations imposed in Section 1, Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution.<br><br>Section 5, Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution further fleshes out the irreducible “powers” of the Supreme Court<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> in terms of its <b><i>original, appellate,</i></b> and <b><i>review adjudicative powers</i></b> and its other non-adjudicative powers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> In so doing, Section 5 also confirmed the extent of the constitutionally-granted adjudicative power of the lower courts that Congress has the authority to create (by defining, prescribing and apportioning their jurisdictions<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>), as well as the grant of <b><i>administrative, executive and quasi-legislative powers</i></b> to the Supreme Court, all within the sphere of its judicial operations.<br><br>Section 5 now provides:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 5. The Supreme Court shall have the following powers:<br><br>(1) Exercise original jurisdiction over cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and over petitions for certiorari, prohibition, mandamus, quo warranto, and habeas corpus.<br><br>(2) Review, revise, reverse, modify, or affirm on <b><i>appeal or certiorari,</i></b> as the <b><i>law or the Rules of Court may provide</i></b>, final judgments and orders of lower courts in:<br><br>(a) All cases in which the <b><i>constitutionality or validity of any treaty, international or executive agreement, law, presidential decree, proclamation, order, instruction, ordinance, or regulation</i></b> is in question.<br><br>(b) All cases involving the <b><i>legality of any tax, impost, assessment, or toll,</i></b> or any penalty imposed in relation thereto.<br><br>(c) All cases in which the <b><i>jurisdiction of any lower court </i></b>is in issue.<br><br>(d) All <b><i>criminal cases</i></b> in which the penalty imposed is reclusion perpetua or higher.<br><br>(e) All cases in which only an <b><i>error or question of law </i></b>is involved.<br><br>(3) Assign temporarily judges of lower courts to other stations as public interest may require. Such temporary assignment shall not exceed six months without the consent of the judge concerned.<br><br>(4) Order a change of venue or place of trial to avoid a miscarriage of justice.<br><br>(5) Promulgate rules concerning the protection and enforcement of constitutional rights, pleading, practice, and procedure in all courts, the admission to the practice of law, the Integrated Bar, and legal assistance to the underprivileged. Such rules shall provide a simplified and inexpensive procedure for the speedy disposition of cases, shall be uniform for all courts of the same grade, and shall not diminish, increase, or modify substantive rights. Rules of procedure of special courts and quasi-judicial bodies shall remain effective unless disapproved by the Supreme Court.<br><br>(6) Appoint all officials and employees of the Judiciary in accordance with the Civil Service Law.</blockquote><br><b>b.1. <u>The Power of Judicial Review</u>.</b><br><br>In the process of making “judicial power” more specific and in outlining the specific powers of the Supreme Court, the Constitution made express the <b><i>power of “judicial review,</i></b><i>” i.e.</i>, the power to pass upon the <b><i>constitutional validity</i></b> of any treaty, international or executive agreement, law, presidential decree, proclamation, order, instruction, ordinance, or regulation,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> as the <i>“law or the Rules of Court may provide.”</i><br><br>This formulation recognizes that the Supreme Court, even before the 1987 Constitution came, already had workable rules of procedure in place for the courts. These rules cover ordinary actions, special civil actions, special proceedings, criminal proceedings, and the rules of evidence in these proceedings, all of which the 1987 Constitution recognized when it mentioned the Rules of Court, but subject to the Supreme Court’s<i> power of amendment.</i><br><br><b>b.2. <u>The New and Expanded Power</u>.</b><br><br>Still <b>another addition</b>, a completely new one, to the concept of judicial power under the 1987 Constitution is <b>the power <i>“to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government.</i></b>”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> This new power is innovative since its recognition is separate from the traditional adjudicative power that Section 1 earlier confirms and which Section 5 in part fleshes out.<br><br>It is likewise a definitive expansion of judicial power as its exercise is not over the traditional justiciable cases handled by judicial and quasi-judicial tribunals. Notably, judicial power is extended <b>over the very <i>powers exercised by other branches or instrumentalities of government</i></b> when grave abuse of discretion is present. In other words, the expansion empowers the judiciary, <b><i>as a matter of duty</i></b>, to inquire into acts of lawmaking by the legislature and into law implementation by the executive when these other branches act with grave abuse of discretion.<br><br>This expansion takes on special meaning when read with the powers of the Court under Section 5, particularly in relation with the Court’s power of <i><b>judicial review</b>, i.e., the power to declare a treaty, international or executive agreement, law, presidential decree, proclamation, order, instruction, ordination or regulation unconstitutional.</i><br><br>Under the expanded judicial power, justiciability expressly depends <b><i>only</i></b> on the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion, as distinguished from a situation where the issue of constitutional validity is raised within a traditionally justiciable case where the elements of actual controversy based on specific legal rights must exist.&nbsp; In fact, even<i> if the requirements for strict justiciability are applied,</i> these requisites can already be taken to be present once grave abuse of discretion is <i>prima facie</i> shown to be present.<br><br>In the process of lawmaking or rulemaking, for example, an <i>actual controversy</i> is already present when the law or rule is shown to have been attended by grave abuse of discretion because it was passed; it operates; or its substantive contents fall, outside the contemplation of the Constitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> This should be contrasted with allegations of constitutional invalidity in the traditional justiciable cases where, by express constitutional requirement, the elements of (1) actual controversy involving (2) demandable and enforceable rights, must be present because what essentially comes to court is the traditional justiciable case, interwoven with constitutional validity questions.<br><br>In the expanded judicial power, any citizen of the Philippines to whom the assailed law or rule is shown to apply necessarily has <i><b>locus standi</b></i> since a constitutional violation constitutes an affront or injury to the affected citizens of the country.&nbsp; If at all, a less stringent requirement of locus standi only needs to be shown to differentiate a justiciable case of this type from the pure or mere opinion that the courts cannot render.<br><br>Necessarily, too, <b><i>a matter is ripe</i></b> for adjudication if the assailed law or rule is already in effect. The traditional rules on <b><i>hierarchy of courts</i></b> and <b><i>transcendental importance</i></b>, far from being grounds for the dismissal of the petition raising the question of unconstitutionality, may be reduced to rules on the level of court that should handle the controversy, as directed by the Supreme Court.<br><br>Thus, when grave abuse of discretion amounting to a clear constitutional violation is alleged and preliminarily shown, the Supreme Court is duty-bound to take cognizance of the case, or at least to remand it to the appropriate lower court, based on its consideration of the urgency, importance or evidentiary requirements of the case.<br><br><b>B. <u>The three types of Adjudicative Judicial Powers.</u></b><br><br>In sum, judicial power, as now provided under the 1987 Constitution, involves three types of controversies, namely:<br><blockquote>(1) the <b>traditional justiciable cases</b> involving actual disputes and controversies based purely on demandable and enforceable rights;<br><br>(2) the <b>traditional justiciable cases</b> as understood in (1), but <b><i>additionally involving</i> jurisdictional and constitutional issues</b>;<br><br>(3) <b>pure constitutional disputes</b> attended by <b>grave abuse of discretion</b> in the process involved or in their result/s.<br></blockquote><br>The <b>first two types</b> are already covered by the Rules of Court that, as recognized by Section 5, are already in place, subject to the amendments that the Supreme Court may promulgate.<br><br>The <b>third type</b> may inferentially be covered by the <i>current</i> provisions of the Rules of Court, specifically by the rules on <i>certiorari, prohibition</i> and <i>mandamus</i> but, strictly speaking, requires special rules that the current Rules of Court do not provide since the third type does not involve disputes arising as traditionally justiciable cases. Most importantly, the third type<i> does not involve judicial or quasi-judicial exercise of adjudicative power</i> that the Supreme Court has traditionally exercised over lower tribunals<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> to ensure that they stay within the confines of their adjudicative jurisdiction.<br><br>In the petitions now before us, these new realities on judicial power necessarily must be considered as the petitions allege actions by the legislature and by the executive that lie outside the contemplation of the Constitution. Specifically, they involve the constitutionally infirm provisions of the RH Law passed by Congress and of the IRR of the law that the executive promulgated through the Department of Health.<br><br>To be sure, the absence of specifically applicable rules cannot be a judicial excuse for simply bodily lifting the rules for the traditional justiciable cases which the present cases are not.&nbsp; In fact, the Court should not even be heard to give an excuse as it is not undertaking a power that it may exercise at its discretion; the Court is discharging an express duty imposed by the Constitution itself.<br><br>In providing for procedural parameters, the Court may not simply hark back to jurisprudence <b><i>before </i></b>the 1987 Constitution as they will not obviously apply, nor to jurisprudence <b><i>after </i></b>the 1987 Constitution that failed to recognize the third type of justiciable controversy for what it is.<br><br>Thus, in the present case, the Court must be guided strictly by the express constitutional command.&nbsp; If past jurisprudence will be made to apply at all, they should be closely read and adjusted to the reality of the third or new type of judicial adjudicative power.<br><br><b>C. The Court is duty bound to resolve the present petitions, not simply dismiss them.&nbsp; </b><br><br>The consolidated petitions before the Court raise several <b><i>constitutional challenges</i></b> against the RH Law, ranging from violations of the right to life of the unborn (and, concomitantly, of the constitutional prohibition against abortion); violations of the freedom of religion and of speech; violations of the rights of parents and protected familial interests; down to the mostly benign allegations of violation of natural law.<br><br>An important and insightful approach is the petitioners’ attack on the RH law by considering it as a<b><i> population control measure</i></b> that is beyond the power of the government to carry out.&nbsp; The respondents parry this attack by arguing that whatever impact the RH law would have on the population would only be incidental, as the main target of the law is to recognize and enhance the reproductive health rights of women.<b> I agree with the <i>ponencia’s</i> analysis of what the RH Law really is, and adopt this analysis and conclusion for purposes of my own discussions in this Opinion.</b><br><br>This snapshot of the petitions strongly shows how the economic, social, cultural and religious dimensions of the RH law cut a swath through the traditional legal and constitutional realm of adjudication.&nbsp; It is no surprise that it took the RH bill fourteen years in Congress before it was enacted into law.<br><br>The sharp divide between the law’s proponents’ and opponents’ views and beliefs on the propriety of the RH law, within and outside its legal and constitutional dimensions, reflect the law’s encompassing impact: its <i><b><u>implementation</u></b></i> could, quite possibly, change the face of Philippine society as we know it today.&nbsp; In fact, in this Separate Opinion, I add my own nagging concerns and observations although I know that these may go into the wisdom of the law and are not appropriate for adjudication. I do this, however, in the name of judicial license that should allow me, as a citizen, to express my own personal observations on the dispute at hand.<br><br>Indeed, if the RH law seeks to bring about strong, socio-political and economic changes even at the price of our historical identity, culture and traditions, then so be it, <b><i>but the affected public should know the impact of the issues that soon enough will confront the nation.</i></b>&nbsp; It is important, too, that changes should not come at the expense of the provisions of the Constitution – the only document that holds the nation together “during times of social disquietude or political excitement,” as in the present case. This should not be lost on us, as a Court, and should be a primary consideration in our present task.<br><br>At the core of the petitions is the RH law’s alleged violation of the right to life of the unborn.&nbsp; I view the unborn’s right to life within the much broader context of Article II, Section 12 of the 1987 Constitution <i>recognizing</i> the sanctity and autonomy of familial relations and the natural and primary parental right in child-rearing, on the one hand, and Article XV, Sections 1 and 3, recognizing the key role of the family, on the other.<br><br>These constitutional provisions serve as the compass guiding this Opinion and should in fact serve as well for the Court’s own decision-making. Even those in the political departments of government should pay them heed, separately from the political and economic considerations that, from the terms of the RH law and its IRR, obviously served as the political departments’ driving force.<br><br>Under our constitutional regime, the judicial department is the only organ of government tasked to guard and enforce the boundaries and limitations that the people had put in place in governing themselves.&nbsp; This constitutional duty of the Court has been <b><i>expanded</i></b> by the additional power of judicial review under the 1987 Constitution to “determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government.”<br><br>These are awesome powers carrying deep and far-ranging duties that we can only discharge while fully aware of their accompanying responsibilities and pre-ordained limits.&nbsp; The present Court, I am sure, is fully aware of the extent of these duties and the limitations, particularly of the rule that we cannot set new polices nor seek to implement current ones as these involve roles that are not constitutionally ours to undertake.<br><br>I am aware, too, that the RH Law now before us carries multi-dimensional repercussion, not all of them within the legal and constitutional realms. These realities, however, should not leave us timid in undertaking our tasks; for as long as we act within the confines of our constitutionally-defined roles, we cannot go wrong.<br><br>A sure measure to best ensure proper action is to consider the petitions <b><i>under the third type of judicial adjudications power (defined above) that we first consciously utilize under the present Constitution</i></b>.&nbsp; In this way, we give full respect to the separation of powers; we step in only when the legislative and the executive step out of the bounds defined for them by the Constitution.<br><br>For all these reasons, I join the ponencia’s result in its ruling that a controversy exists appropriate for this Court’s <i>initial consideration</i> of the presence of grave abuse of discretion, and <i>consequent adjudication</i> if the legislative and executive actions can be so characterized.<br><br><center><b>II. <u>Substantive Discussions</u>&nbsp; </b></center><br><br><b>A. The RH Law does not fully protect the right to life of the unborn child.&nbsp; </b><br><br><b>a. Overview&nbsp; </b><br><br>The 1987 Constitution has implicitly recognized the right to life of the unborn child under its Section 12 when it gave the mandate, under the Section’s second sentence, to protect the unborn life from its conception, equally with the life of mother.<br><br>I agree with the <i>ponencia’s</i> conclusion that under Section 12, the conception that the Constitution expressly speaks of, occurs upon fertilizations of the ovum. Thus, the RH law cannot be faulted in its definition of an <b><i>abortifacient </i></b>to be<i> any drug or device that kills or destroys the fertilized ovum or prevents its implantation in the uterus</i>.<br><br>I <b><i>slightly</i></b> differ, however, from the way the <i>ponencia</i> arrived at its conclusion. To me, the Constitution never raised the question of “when life begins”;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> in fact, this is a question that the framers of the Constitution sensibly avoided by simply adopting the formulation “<i>the life of the unborn from conception.</i>” Interestingly, they even dropped the term “moment of conception” since this precise moment cannot be determined with certainty. The answer the framers decided upon (reinforced by undisputed medical authorities) and which they hope future constitutional leaders and decision-makers will grasp and respect is that <b><i>once the sperm cell and the egg cell unite (resulting in the combination of their genetic materials to form the fertilized egg or the zygote)</i></b>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> <b><i>the protection intended for the unborn should be triggered with full force.</i></b> I write this Opinion with full respect for this hope.<br><br>Thus, I agree with the ponencia that the RH law protects and promotes the right to life of the unborn by its continued prohibition on abortion and distribution of abortifacients.&nbsp; I do recognize, however, that while the RH law generally protects and promotes the unborn’s right to life, its<b><i> Section 9 and its IRR fail in their fidelity to the Constitution and to the very terms of the RH Law itself. For one, it fails to adopt the principle of double effect under Section 12, Article II of the 1987 Constitution,</i></b> as more fully discussed below.<br><br>For these reasons, I cannot wholly concur that the <b><i>RH law and its IRR</i></b>, as they came to this Court, were fully protective of the right to life of the unborn. In fact, the Court should lay down guidelines, culled from a constitutionally-valid RH Law, of what the government can actually procure and distribute under the RH law, consistent with its authority under this law and Section 12, Article II of the Constitution.<br><br><b><center>i.&nbsp; The primacy of life in the Philippine context&nbsp; </center></b><br>The primacy of life from its earliest inception is a constitutional ideal <i>unique</i> to the 1987 Philippine Constitution. While our system of government of tripartite allocation of powers (Articles VI to VIII), the concept of our Bill of Rights (Article III) and even the traditional concept of judicial review (Section 1, Article VIII) may have been of American origin, the idea of life itself as a fundamental constitutional value from its earliest inception carries deep roots in the Philippine legal system.<br><br>The idea of life as a fundamental constitutional value from its earliest inception is not of recent vintage although our previous constitutions did not have a provision equivalent to the present Section 12, Article II.&nbsp; Our legal history shows that abortion laws have been in existence even during the Spanish regime when the Spanish Penal Code was made applicable in the Philippines. When the Revised Penal Code was enacted in 1930, the life of the unborn was also considered by suspending the execution of the death sentence<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> on a <i>pregnant</i> woman. Under the New Civil Code of 1950, an unborn child is granted <b><i>presumptive personality</i></b> from the time of its conception for civil purposes that are favorable to it, although subject to the condition that it be born later.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> To a certain extent, this presumptive personality is already recognized under our penal laws. Under Title I (Crimes Against Persons), Chapter 8 (Destruction of Life) of the Revised Penal Code, the killing of viable, and even non-viable, fetuses may result in criminal liability.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>The continued efficacy of these statutory provisions evidences our society’s high regard for the life of the unborn; thus, our present Constitution allows us to disregard it only for the equally paramount necessity of saving the life of the unborn’s mother. It also reflects not only our society’s recognition of and respect for the life of the unborn as a Filipino ideal to be pursued under the 1987 Philippine Constitution, but of the country’s own cultural values as a people.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>That this same respect is now <i>expressly </i>provided under the 1987 Constitution is not so much for the purpose of creating a right, but for the purpose of strengthening the protection we extend to the unborn life against varied external threats to it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> It would indeed be <i><b>very ironic</b></i> if the threat would come from our own government via the abortifacients it hopes to distribute under the RH Law’s IRR.<br><br><b>b.&nbsp; The 1987 Constitution<br><br>i. The status of the unborn under the 1987 Constitution</b><br><br>Although the framers of the Constitution expressly recognized the unborn’s right to life from conception, they did not intend to give the unborn the status of a person under the law.<br><br>Instead, the framers distinguished between the unborn’s right to life and the rights resulting from the acquisition of legal personality upon birth in accordance with law. Unlike the rights emanating from personhood, the right to life granted to the unborn is in itself complete from conception, unqualified by any condition.<br><br>Although Section 12, Article II of the Constitution does not consider the unborn a person, its terms reflect the framers’ clear intent to convey an utmost respect for human life<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> that is not merely co-extensive with civil personality.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> This intent requires the extension of <b>State protection</b> to the life of the unborn from conception.&nbsp; To be precise, Section 12, Article II of the 1987 Constitution provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 12. The State recognizes the sanctity of family life and shall protect and strengthen the family as a basic autonomous social institution. It shall <b>equally protect the life of the mother and the life of the unborn from conception</b>. The natural and primary right and duty of parents in the rearing of the youth for civic efficiency and the development of moral character shall receive the support of the Government.<br><br>ii. The constitutional meaning of conception and to whom is this right to life extended</blockquote><br>Unlike the<i> ponencia</i>, I take the view that the question of <i>when the life of the unborn begins</i> cannot strictly be answered with reference to time, <i>i.e</i>., the exact time the sperm cell fertilized the egg cell.&nbsp; But other than this uncertainty, the germinal stage<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> of prenatal development<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> that transpires (after the union of the sperm cell and the egg cell and the combination of their genetic material materialized to form the fertilized egg or the zygote) is not debatable.<br><br>Upon fertilization, a complex sequence of events is initiated by the zygote to establish the molecular conditions required for continued embryonic development. <b>The behavior of the zygote </b>at this point is radically unlike that of either sperm or egg separately; it exhibits signs of independent life <b>characteristic of a human organism.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Since the constitutional intent is to protect the life of the unborn, and the fertilized egg (or the zygote) already exhibits signs and characteristics of life, then this fertilized egg is already entitled to constitutional protection. I say this even if this fertilized egg may not always naturally develop into a baby or a person.<br><br><b><i>I submit that for purposes of constitutional interpretation, every doubt should be resolved in favor of life, as this is the rule of life, anywhere, everywhere; any doubt should be resolved in favor of its protection following a deeper law that came before all of us – the law commanding the preservation of the human specie</i></b>. This must have been the subconscious reason why even those who voted against the inclusion of the second sentence of Section 12 in Article II of the Constitution conceded that a fertilized ovum - the word originally used prior to its substitution by the word “unborn” - is possessed of human life although they disagreed that a <i>right</i> to life itself should be extended to it in the Constitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>It is in these lights that I dispute the Solicitor General’s argument that Congress’ determination (that contraceptives are not abortifacients) is entitled to the highest respect from this Court since it was arrived at after receiving, over the years, evidence, expert testimonies and position papers on the distinction between contraceptives and abortifacients.<br><br>The Solicitor General argues that even assuming medical uncertainty on the mechanisms of contraceptives and Intrauterine Devises in view of the contrary opinions of other medical experts, this uncertainty does not prevent Congress from passing the RH law because legislative options “in areas fraught with medical and scientific uncertainties” must be “especially broad” and calls for judicial deference until an actual case exists.<br><br><b>I cannot agree with the implied assertion that Congress’ determination that contraceptives are not abortifacients is binding on the Court.</b><br><br><b><i><u>First</u></i></b>, the nature of a particular contraceptive to be distributed by the government under the RH law still has to be determined by the FDA and any advance recognition by Congress of its abortifacient or non-abortifacient character would be premature.<br><br><b><i><u>Second</u></i></b>, as will be discussed shortly, the statutory meaning of “abortifacient,” on which the constitutional acceptability of a contraceptive depends, must depend in the first place on the extent of the prohibition defined in the Constitution, not as defined by Congress.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br><b><i><u>Third</u></i></b>, and more importantly, while US case law has established Congress’ broad discretion in areas where medical uncertainty exists, none of these cases<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> involved a challenge on congressional discretion and its collision with a specific constitutional provision protecting the life of the unborn from conception. This aspect of the present cases uniquely distinguishes them from the cases cited by the respondents. In the same vein, the specific provisions unique to the 1987 Constitution limit the applicability of parallel US jurisprudence in resolving issues through solutions consistent with our own “aspirations and ideals” as a nation and our own tradition and cultural identity as a people.<br><br><b><i><u><i>Fourth and last</i></u>, this Court cannot be deferential to any official, institution or entity, in the discharge of the Court’s duty to interpret the Constitution, most specially when the existence of the most important physical and spiritual being on earth – humankind – is at stake</i></b>.&nbsp; Let it not be said hereafter that this Court did not exert its all in this task. When –<i> God forbid</i>! – fetuses begin dying because abortifacients have been improvidently distributed by government, let not the blame be lain at the door of this Court.<br><br><b>iii. Section 12, Article II of the 1987<br>Constitution as a self-executing provision</b><br><br>The respondents argue that the recognition of a right under the Constitution does not automatically bestow a right enforceable through adjudication.&nbsp; Thus, they claim that Section 12, Article II of the 1987 Constitution is not a self-executing provision; while this Section recognizes the right to life of the unborn child, it leaves to Congress the discretion on how it is to be implemented. The RH law actually embodies the exercise of Congress’ prerogative in this area when it prohibited abortion and access to abortifacients.<br><br>I submit that the mandate to equally protect the life of the mother and the life of the unborn child from conception under Section 12, Article II of the Constitution is <b><i>self-executing <u>to prevent and prohibit the state from enacting legislation that threatens the right to life of the unborn child</u>.</i></b><br><br>To my mind, Section 12, Article II should not be read narrowly as a mere policy declaration lest the actual intent of the provision be effectively negated.&nbsp; While it is indeed a directive to the State to equally protect the life of the mother and the unborn child, this command cannot be accomplished without the corollary and indirect <b><i>mandate to the State to inhibit itself</i></b> from enacting programs that contradict protection for the life of the unborn.<br><br>Read closely, the second paragraph of Section 12, Article II contains two mandates for the State to comply with:<br><br><i><u>First</u></i>, it contains a <i><b>positive command</b></i> for the State to enact legislation that, in line with the broader context of protecting and strengthening the Filipino family, recognizes and protects equally the life of the unborn child and the mother. It is within this context that Congress enacted the RH Law’s provisions,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> as well as prior laws<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> that provide healthcare measures for the mother and her child during and after pregnancy.<br><br><b><i><u>Second</u></i></b>, Section 12, Article II provides a <b><i>negative command</i></b> against the State to refrain from implementing programs that threaten the life of the unborn child or that of the mother. This is a constitutional directive to the Executive Department.<br><br>By commanding the State to equally protect the life of the unborn child and the life of the mother, the Constitution not only recognizes these rights, but provides a minimum level of protection in the case of the unborn child. In effect, the Constitution prohibits the State from implementing programs that are contrary to its avowed policies; in the case of the unborn child, the State cannot go lower than the minimum level of protection demanded by the Constitution.<br><br>In concrete terms, the State cannot, <b><i>in the guise of enacting social welfare legislation,</i></b> threaten the life of the unborn child after conception. The State recognizes the right to life of the unborn child from conception, and this should not be imperiled by the State itself in the course of reproductive health programs that promote and provide contraceptives with abortifacient properties.&nbsp; In more specific terms under the circumstances of this case, the State cannot, through the legislature, pass laws seemingly paying respect and rendering obedience to the Constitutional mandate while, through the executive, promulgating Implementing Rules and Regulations that deviously circumvent the Constitution and the law.<br><br>To recapitulate, the State, through Congress, exercises full authority in formulating programs that reflect the Constitution’s policy directive to equally protect the life of the mother and the unborn child and strengthen the Filipino family while the Executive carries the role of implementing these programs and polices.&nbsp; This discretion, however, is limited by the flipside of Section 12, Article II’s directive – <i>i.e.,</i> these programs cannot contradict the equal protection granted to the life of the unborn child from conception and the life of the mother.<br><br>I now proceed to my reading and appreciation of whether the right to protection, both of the mother and the unborn, are fully respected under the RH law.<br><br>At the outset, I note that both the petitioners and the respondents agree that Section 12, Article II of the 1987 Constitution prohibits abortion in the Philippines. This point of agreement not only strengthens my argument regarding the self-executing nature of the negative command implicit in the provision, but also sets the stage for the point of constitutional query in the present case.<br><br>To me, the question in the present case involves the scope of the level of protection that Section 12, Article II recognizes for the unborn child: to what extent does Section 12, Article II of the 1987 Constitution protect the unborn’s right to life? And does the RH Law comply with the protection contemplated under this constitutional provision?<br><br>According to the OSG, the RH law does not violate the right to life provision under the Constitution because the law continues to prohibit abortion and excludes abortifacients from the provision of access to modern family planning products and device. By anti-abortion, the public respondents meant preventing the Supreme Court from creating a Roe v. Wade rule – a rule that granted women the right to terminate pregnancy under the trimestral rule.<br><br><b>c. Section 12, Article II of the 1987 Constitution and Roe v. Wade&nbsp; </b><br><br>I submit that the scope and level of protection that Section 12, Article II of the 1987 Constitution is deeper and more meaningful than the prohibition of abortion within the meaning of <i>Roe v. Wade.</i><br><br>In the landmark case of <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, a Texas statute made it a crime to procure or attempt an abortion except when necessary to save the life of the mother. After discussing abortion from a historical perspective, the US Supreme Court noted the three reasons behind the enactment of criminal abortion laws in the different states in the United States, <i>viz: first,</i> the law sought to discourage illicit sexual conduct – a reason that has not been taken seriously; <i>second</i>, since the medical procedure involved <i>was </i>then hazardous to the woman, the law seeks to restrain her from submitting to a procedure that placed her life in serious jeopardy; <i>third,</i> <u>the law advances the State's interest in protecting prenatal life<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> - a reason that is disputed because of the absence of legislative history that supports such interest.</u> The Court said that “it is with these interests, and the weight to be attached to them, that this case is concerned.” Unhesitatingly, the US Supreme Court struck down the law as unconstitutional and ruled that the right to privacy extends to a pregnant woman’s decision whether to terminate her pregnancy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> It observed:<br><br><blockquote>This right of privacy, xxx is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. <b><u>The detriment that the State would impose upon the pregnant woman by denying this choice altogether is apparent.</u></b> Specific and direct harm medically diagnosable even in early pregnancy may be involved. Maternity, or additional offspring, may force upon the woman a distressful life and future. Psychological harm may be imminent. Mental and physical health may be taxed by child care. There is also the distress, for all concerned, associated with the unwanted child, and there is the problem of bringing a child into a family already unable, psychologically and otherwise, to care for it. In other cases, as in this one, the additional difficulties and continuing stigma of unwed motherhood may be involved. All these are factors the woman and her responsible physician necessarily will consider in consultation.</blockquote><br>Among the cases that Roe cited in support of its ruling, anchored on the right to privacy, are the cases of <i>Griswold v. Connecticut</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> and <i>Eisenstadt v. Baird</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; In<i> Griswold</i>, the Court invalidated a Connecticut law that made it a crime to use and abet the use of contraceptives for violating a married couples’ right to privacy.&nbsp; In <i>Eisenstadt</i>, the Court extended the protection of the right to privacy even to unmarried individuals by invalidating a Massachusetts law that penalized anyone who distributed contraceptives except if done by a physician to married couples.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>While <i>Roe</i> recognized the state’s legitimate interest in protecting the pregnant woman's health and the potentiality of human life, it considered the pregnant woman’s decision to terminate her pregnancy <i><u>prior</u></i> to the point of fetal viability (under a trimestral framework<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>) as a liberty interest that should <i>prevail</i> over the state interest.<br><br>Apart from the context in which the U.S. decision is written, a reading of the second sentence of Section 12, Article II, in light of the framers’ intent in incorporating it in the Constitution, reveals more distinctions from Roe than what the public respondents claim.<br><br>The framers did not only intend to prevent the <b>Supreme Court</b> from having a Philippine equivalent of a <i>Roe v. Wade </i>decision,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> they also unequivocally intended to deny Congress the power to determine that only at a certain stage of prenatal development can the constitutional protection intended for the life unborn be triggered.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; In short, the clear intent of the Framers was to prevent both <b><i>Congress <u>and</u> the Supreme Court</i></b> from making abortion possible.<br><br>Indeed, in discussing the third reason for the enactment of a criminal abortion law, <i>Roe</i> avoided any reliance on the theory that life begins at conception, much less on the principle that accompanies the theory that there must be a protected right to life at that stage.&nbsp; Instead the U.S. Supreme Court merely deferred to the State’s legitimate interest in potential life. In the 1987 Philippine Constitution, by inserting the second sentence of Section 12, Article II, the framers sought to make an express rejection of this view in Roe.<br><br>Thus, while this Court or Congress cannot conclusively answer the question of “when life begins” as in <i>Roe</i>, Philippine constitutional law rejects the right to privacy as <i>applied in Roe</i> by granting a right to life to the unborn (even as a fertilized egg or zygote) instead of gratuitously assuming that the State simply has an interest in a potential life that would be subject to a balancing of interest test other than the interest that the Constitution expressly recognizes.<br><br>Interestingly, in <i>Carey v. Population Services, Int’l.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> in striking down a New York law criminalizing the sale, distribution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> and advertisement of nonprescription contraceptives, the US Supreme Court clarified that they so rule “not because there is an independent fundamental ‘right of access to contraceptives,’ but because such access is essential to the exercise of the constitutionally protected right of decision in matters of childbearing that is the underlying foundation of the holdings in <i>Griswold, Eisenstadt v. Baird</i>, and <i>Roe v. Wade</i>.”&nbsp; Accordingly, the State cannot pass a law impeding its distribution on pain of prosecution. <i>No such law is involved in the present case.<br></i><br>In Planned <i>Parenthood v. Casey</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> the US Supreme Court reaffirmed the “central holding” in <i>Roe v. Wade,</i> among others, that the State has legitimate interests <i>from the outset of the pregnancy</i> in protecting the health of the woman and the life of the fetus that may become a child.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; In the Philippine jurisdiction, these legitimate interests rest on a higher and stronger ground not only because they are commanded by our Constitution but because these legitimate interests were made <b><i>to extend to the life of the unborn from conception</i></b>.&nbsp; The mandatory command of the Constitution to protect the life of the unborn by itself limits the power of Congress in enacting reproductive health laws, <b><i>particularly on subsidizing contraceptives.</i></b><br><br><b>d.&nbsp; Abortion, abortifacients and the RH Law&nbsp; </b><br><br>As I earlier noted, both petitioners and the respondents agree that Section 12, Article II of the 1987 Constitution prohibits abortion. As to what abortion is and when pregnancy is established, the Medical Experts’ Declaration cited by the respondents themselves is instructive:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>xxx<br></li><li>xxx<br></li><li>All contraceptives, including hormonal contraceptives and IUDs, have been demonstrated by laboratory and clinical studies, to act primarily prior to fertilization. Hormonal contraceptives prevent ovulation and make cervical mucus impenetrable to sperm. Medicated IUDs act like hormonal contraceptives. Copper T IUDs incapacitate sperm and prevent fertilization.<br></li><li>The thickening or thinning of the endometrium (inner lining of the uterus) associated with the use of hormonal contraceptives has not been demonstrated to exert contraceptive action, i.e. if ovulation happens and there is fertilization, <b><u>the developing fertilized egg (blastocyst) will implant and result in a pregnancy (contraceptive failure)</u></b>. In fact, blastocysts have been shown to implant in inhospitable sites without an endometrium, such as in Fallopian tubes.<br></li><li><b><u>Pregnancy can be detected and established</u></b> using currently available laboratory and clinical tests – e.g. blood and urine levels of HCG (Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin) and ultrasound – <b><u>only after implantation of the blastocyst.</u></b> While there are efforts to study chemical factors associated with fertilization, currently there is no test establishing if and when it occurs.<br></li><li><b><u>Abortion is the termination of an established pregnancy</u></b> before fetal viability (the fetus’ ability to exist independently of the mother). Aside from the 50% of zygotes that are naturally unable to implant, an additional wastage of about 20% of all fertilized eggs occurs due to spontaneous abortions (miscarriages).<br></li><li>Abortifacient drugs have different chemical properties and actions from contraceptives. <b><u>Abortifacients terminate an established pregnancy</u></b>, while contraceptives prevent pregnancy by preventing fertilization.<br><br></li><li>xxx</li></ol></blockquote><br>Based on paragraph number 6 of the Medical Experts’ Declaration, abortion is the termination of established pregnancy and that abortifacients, logically, terminate this pregnancy. Under paragraph number 5, pregnancy is established only <b><i>after</i></b> the implantation of the blastocysts or the fertilized egg. From this <b><u>medical viewpoint,</u></b> it is clear that prior to implantation, it is premature to talk about abortion and abortifacient as there is nothing yet to abort.<br><br><i><b>If the constitutional framers simply intended to adopt this medical viewpoint in crafting Section 12, Article II, there would have been no real need to insert the phrase “from conception.</b></i>” <b><u>This should be obvious to a discerning reader</u></b>. Since conception was equated with fertilization, as borne out by Records of the Constitutional Commission, <b>a fertilized egg or zygote, even without being implanted in the uterus, is therefore already entitled to constitutional protection from the State</b>.<br><br><b><blockquote>e. The RH law’s definition of abortifacient<br>textually complies with Section 12,<br>Article II, 1987 Constitution; Section 9<br>negates this conclusion.</blockquote></b><br>In this regard, I find that despite the recognition of abortion only at a late stage from the <i>strict medical viewpoint,</i> the RH law’s implied definition of abortion is broad enough to extend the prohibition against abortion to cover the fertilized egg or the zygote. Consistent with the constitutional protection of a fertilized egg or zygote, the RH Law defines an abortifacient as:<br><br><blockquote>any drug or device that induces abortion or the destruction of a fetus inside the mother’s womb or the prevention of the fertilized ovum to reach and be implanted in the mother’s womb upon determination of the FDA.</blockquote><br>By considering a drug or device that prevents the fertilized ovum from reaching and implanting in the mother’s womb as an abortifacient, the law protects the unborn at the earliest stage of its pre-natal development.<br><br>Thus, I agree with<b> the <i>ponencia </i>that the RH law’s definition of abortifacient is constitutional</b>. The law, however, still leaves a nagging and contentious question relating to the provision of its Section 9, which reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>SEC. 9. The Philippine National Drug Formulary System and Family Planning Supplies.</b> – The National Drug Formulary shall include hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine devices, injectables and other safe, legal, <b>non-abortifacient</b> and effective family planning products and supplies. The Philippine National Drug Formulary System (PNDFS) shall be observed in selecting drugs including family planning supplies that will be included or removed from the Essential Drugs List (EDL) in accordance with existing practice and in consultation with reputable medical associations in the Philippines. For the purpose of this Act, <b><u>any product or supply included or to be included in the EDL must have a certification from the FDA that said product and supply is made available on the condition that it <i>is not to be used as an abortifacient</i></u></b>.<br><br>These products and supplies shall also be included in the regular purchase of essential medicines and supplies of all national hospitals: Provided, further, That the foregoing offices <b><u>shall not purchase or acquire by any means emergency contraceptive pills, postcoital pills, abortifacients that will be used for such purpose</u></b> and their other forms or equivalent. [emphases ours]</blockquote><br>Section 9 includes hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine devices and injectables (collectively, <i>contraceptives</i>) among the family planning products and supplies in the National Drug Formulary, and makes them part of the products and supplies included in the regular purchase of all national hospitals. While the FDA still has to determine whether a particular contraceptive is abortive in nature, the underscored portion of <b><i>paragraph 2 of Section 9 strongly indicates that abortifacients will be available for procurement and distribution by the government</i></b>. In short, the second paragraph of Section 9 itself confirms that the contraceptives to be distributed by the government are <b><u>abortifacient-capable</u> <i>depending only on its “use.</i></b>”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>That abortifacient-capable contraceptives will be procured and distributed by the government (necessarily using State funds) under Section 9 of the RH law is confirmed by the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of the RH law itself.<br><br>The IRR defines an <i><u>abortifacient</u></i> as “any drug or device that <b><u><i>primarily</i></u></b> induces abortion or the destruction of a fetus inside the mother’s womb or the prevention of the fertilized ovum to reach and be implanted in the mother’s womb upon determination of the Food and Drug Administration.” It also defines a <i><u>contraceptive</u></i> as “any safe, legal, effective, and scientifically proven modern family planning method, device, or health product, whether natural or artificial, that prevents pregnancy but does not <b><u><i>primarily</i></u></b> destroy a fertilized ovum or prevent a fertilized ovum from being implanted in the mother’s womb.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br><b><u><i>By these definitions, the RH law’s IRR has added a qualification to the definition of an abortifacient that is not found in the law.</i></u></b> Under the IRR of the RH law, a drug or device is an abortifacient only if its <i>primary</i> mechanism - as opposed to <i>secondary</i> mechanism, which the petitioners have strongly asserted - is abortive in nature. This added qualification to the definition of an abortifacient is a strong argument in favor of the petitioners that the contraceptives to be distributed by the state are abortifacient-capable.<br><br>Thus, in one breath, Section 9 of the RH law allows the inclusion of non-abortifacients only in the National Drug Formulary and in another breath allows the distribution of abortifacients based solely on the FDA certification that these abortifacents should not be used as such. To address this conflict, the <i>ponencia</i> submits that the FDA’s certification in the last sentence of paragraph 1 of Section 9 should mean that the contraceptives to be made available “<i>cannot</i>” – instead of “is not” - be used as abortifacient, following the no-abortion principle under the Constitution.<br><br>To my mind, this inconsistency within the provision of Section 9, as reinforced by the RH law’s IRR, should be addressed by construing it in relation with the entirety of the RH law.<br><br>One of the guiding principles under the RH law is the primacy given to effective and quality reproductive health care services to ensure maternal and child health.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; Towards this end, the RH law allows properly trained and certified midwives and nurses to administer “lifesaving drugs such as, but not limited to, oxytocin and magnesium sulfate, in accordance with the guidelines set by the DOH, under emergency conditions and when there are no physicians available.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; Similarly, the RH law included in the definition of Basic Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (BEMONC) the administration of certain drugs as part of lifesaving services for emergency maternal and newborn conditions/complications. These provisions are consistent with the State’s commitment to reduce both maternal and infant mortality, and to ultimately save lives.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>The “life-saving” thrust of the law is complemented by the RH law’s provisions that continues to prohibit abortion and prohibits the procurement and distribution of abortifacients. The RH law also limited the extent of the reproductive health rights it grants by excluding from its coverage abortion and access to abortifacients.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> More specifically, it broadly defined abortifacients to include any drug or device that prevents the fertilized ovum from reaching and implanting in the womb. Thus, the RH law protects the fertilized ovum (zygote) consistent with Section 12, Article II of the 1987 Constitution.<br><br>Considering the “life-saving” thrust of the law, the procurement and distribution of abortifacients allowed under Section 9 should be interpreted with this “life-saving” thrust in mind. As an aid in understanding this approach, I quote respondent Senator Cayetano’s explanation, cited by the public respondents:<br><br><blockquote>Allow me to explain. A careless phrase like “no drug known to be an abortifacient will be made available in the Philippines” sounds like a statement we could all support. But what most of us do not understand is the fact that many life-saving drugs are made available to an ailing mother to address her medical condition although there is a possibility that they may be harmful to a pregnant mother and her fetus. Thus, we have for instance, drugs for diseases of the heart, hypertension, seizures, ulcers and even acne, all of which are to be taken only under doctors’ prescription and supervision precisely because of their harmful effects.<br><br><b>Making a blanket statement banning all medicines classified as abortifacients would put all these mothers and their children’s lives in greater danger</b>. For decades, these mothers have relied on these medicines <b>to keep them alive</b>. I would like to give another example. A known abortifacient, misoprostol commonly known as cytotec, is one of the drugs that can save a mother’s life. I am talking about a mother who just gave birth but has internal hemorrhage and in danger of bleeding to death. Her child has been born. Her child will live but she will die without this drug to stop her bleeding. Are we now to ban the use of this drug? Are we now to say that because it could possibly be used as an abortifacient, it could possibly be abused, this mother must now die despite giving birth to a healthy baby?<br><br>Mr. President, we clearly need to make distinctions. These <b>life saving drugs</b> SHOULD NOT BE USED on any circumstances for purposes of carrying out an abortion. But under strict guidelines by the FDA, they can be used by a health practitioner to save a mother’s life.</blockquote><br>In short, the law allows the procurement of abortifacients under Section 9 <b><i><u>only</u></i></b> for the equally compelling interest of the State to save the life of the mother on account of a medical necessity.<br><br><b>f. The principle of double effect&nbsp; </b><br><br>In situations where the life of the unborn and the life of the mother collide with each other, the principle of double effect under Section 12, Article II must be applied. The Sponsorship Speech of Constitutional Commissioner Villegas discussed the principle of double effect, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>What if a doctor has to choose between the life of the child and the life of the mother? Will the doctor be guilty of murder if the life of the child is lost? The doctor is morally obliged always to try to save both lives. However, he can act in favor of one when it is medically impossible to save both, provided that no direct harm is intended to the other. If the above principles are observed, the loss of the child's life is not intentional and, therefore, unavoidable. Hence, the doctor would not be guilty of abortion or murder.<br><br>I am sure Commissioner Nolledo can give the jurisprudence on this case, the application of the moral principle called the principle of double effect. In a medical operation performed on the mother, the indirect sacrifice of the child's life is not murder because there is no direct intention to kill the child. The direct intention is to operate on the mother and, therefore, there is no dilemma. And let me say that medical science has progressed so much that those situations are very few and far between. If we can produce babies in test tubes I can assure you that those so-called dilemma situations are very rare, and if they should occur there is a moral principle, the principle of double effect, that can be applied.<br><br>What would you say are the solutions to these hard cases? The most radical solution to these hard cases would be a caring and loving society that would provide services to support both the woman and the child physically and psychologically. This is the pro-life solution. The abortion solution, on the other hand, not only kills the fetus but also kills any care and love that society could have offered the aggrieved mother.<br><br>Implicit in all these arguments is the petition for the Constitution, the arguments against Section 9, requiring the State to equally protect the life of the mother and the life of the unborn from the moment of conception. These arguments want the Constitution to be open to the possibility of legalized abortion. The arguments have been put on record for the reference of future legislation and jurisprudence. xxx</blockquote><br>I wholly agree with this position. Thus, to me, the general rule is that both the life of the unborn and the life of the mother should be protected.&nbsp; However, in case of exceptional conflict situations, the life of one may be preferred over the life of the other where it becomes medically necessary to do so. The principle of double effect recognizes that in some instances, the use or administration of certain drugs that are abortifacient-capable are necessary in order to save the life of the mother.&nbsp; The use in administration of these drugs in these instances is and should be allowed by Section 12, Article II of the Constitution since the policy is equal protection.<br><br>Justice Leonen argues in this regard that the principle of double effect is a Christian principle that may or may not be adopted by all of the medical community. He even claims that there are some who recommended its abandonment.<br><br>I submit that the religious roots of a principle adopted by the Constitution, is not a valid ground to ignore the principle altogether. While some parts of the Constitution were of foreign origin, some parts – including the entire text of Section 12, Article II – were uniquely Filipino, intended to be reflective of our own Filipino culture and tradition. I particularly refer to the primacy of life in our hierarchy of values. Not surprisingly, the public respondents do not dispute this principle of double effect and even allowed abortifacient to be used only for the purpose of equally safeguarding the life of the mother.&nbsp; The representatives of the people themselves recognized the primacy of life and the principle of double effect in Section 12, Article II when it gave a broad definition of an abortifacient to extend the protection to life to the fertilized ovum (zygote). These reasons effectively refute Justice Leone’s positions.<br><br><b><i>k.&nbsp; The role of the DOH</i></b><br><br>As the lead agency in the implementation of the RH law, the Department of Health (<i>DOH</i>) is tasked to “[e]nsure people’s access to medically safe, non-abortifacient, legal, quality and affordable reproductive health goods and services[.]”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> This is consistent with the RH law’s policy which “guarantees universal access [only] to medically-safe [and] non-abortifacient” contraceptives.

Guidelines</b></i><br><br>Under the RH law, the Food and Drug Administration (<i>FDA</i>) is tasked to determine whether a drug or device is abortifacient in nature.

By this, I refer to the definition of an abortifacient under the RH law, <i>i.e.</i>, without qualification on whether the nature of its action (to induce abortion, or the destruction of a fetus inside the mother’s womb or the prevention of the fertilized ovum to reach and be implanted in the mother’s womb) is primary or secondary.<br><br>As a matter of <b><i><u>exception</u></i></b>, the government should be able to procure and distribute abortifacients or drugs with abortifacient properties but solely <b>for the purpose of saving the life of the mother</b>. Specifically, the procurement and distribution of these abortifacients may be allowed only in emergency cases and should thus be made under medical supervision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> The IRR of the RH law defines an “emergency” as a condition or state of a patient wherein based on the objective findings of a prudent medical officer on duty for the day there is immediate danger and where delay in initial support and treatment may cause loss of life or cause permanent disability to the patient.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>In short, after the FDA’s prior determination that the drug or device is abortifacient-capable,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> the FDA will have to issue a certification that these drugs or devices are not to be used as abortifacients whether under the first or second paragraphs of Section 9.

This condition is also a recognition of the abortifacient-capable nature of “emergency contraceptive pills.” Given this nature, their procurement and distribution must likewise involve emergency situation. However, the IRR’s own definition of an “emergency contraceptive pills” does not contemplate an emergency situation that permits its procurement and distribution.<br><br><blockquote>l)<i> Emergency Contraceptive Pills</i>, also known as <i>Postcoital Pills</i> refers to methods of contraception that can be used to prevent pregnancy in the first few days after intercourse intended for emergency use following unprotected intercourse, contraceptive failure or misuse,x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></blockquote><br>The “emergency” situation contemplated under the definition of an “emergency contraceptive pills” as quoted above is not the “emergency” situation under the principle of double effect in Section 12, Article II of the 1987 Constitution or the emergency as defined in the same IRR of the RH law.&nbsp; Should the FDA find, pursuant to its mandate under the RH law, that an emergency contraceptive pill or post-coital pill is abortifacient or is abortifacient-capable, then their distribution and procurement should follow the guideline under the exception.<br><br>If an abortifacient-capable drug essentially serves a purpose other than saving the life of the mother – and is, therefore, not included in the DOH guidelines that list what drugs or device are essentially used for life-saving purposes – then the general rule applies: <b><i>the government may not procure and distribute it.</i></b><br><br>Lastly, under Section 7.03 of the IRR of the RH law drugs, medicines, and health products for reproductive health services that are already included in the Essential Drug List as of the effectivity of the IRR shall remain in the EDL, pending <b><i>FDA certification that these are not to be used as abortifacients.</i></b><br><br>Since these are contraceptives that are already registered with the FDA<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> under RA No. 3720 as amended by RA No. 9711,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> these contraceptives must undergo evaluation by the FDA under the provisions of the RH law to determine whether these are abortifacients - as defined by law and not by the IRR.&nbsp; In either case, the general rule and the exception I have laid down above should apply.&nbsp; On the one hand, if these products are non-abortifacients as defined under the RH law, then the government may procure and distribute them; on the other hand, if these products are abortifacients or are abortifacient-capable, the FDA may issue its certification under Section 7.03 of the IRR if the product is essentially used for life-saving purposes.<br><br>If the DOH determines that the product is essentially used for life-saving or emergency purposes, the DOH may (i) procure these contraceptives strictly following its (DOH) own guidelines that list the drugs or devices that are essentially used for life-saving purposes; and (ii) distribute these based on DOH guidelines that limit its distribution strictly for life-saving, medically-supervised and, therefore, non-abortive purpose.

Parental Rights</b><br><br><b>I also agree with the <i>ponencia</i> that an attack on Section 14 of the RH law is premature, but for my own reasons and qualifications.</b><br><br>Section 14 of the RH Law mandates the provision of “age-and-development-appropriate reproductive health education” in both the formal and non-formal education system in the country, and for its integration in relevant subjects in the curriculum, thus:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 14.

The Court is thus not in the position to speculate on its contents and determine whether they adhere to the Constitution.<br><br>I agree with the <i>ponencia’s</i> observation that the lack of a curriculum renders the petitioners’ allegations premature, and dispute Justice Reyes’s position that the issue of Section 14’s constitutionality is ripe for adjudication and that based on this, we can already rule with finality that Section 14 is constitutional.<br><br>We cannot, without first examining the actual contents of the curriculum and the religious beliefs and personal convictions of the parents that it could affect, declare that the mandatory RH education is consistent with the Constitution. In other words, we cannot declare that the mandatory RH education program does not violate parental rights when the curriculum that could possibly supplant it is not yet in existence. Given the primacy of the natural and fundamental rights of parents to raise their children, we should not pre-empt a constitutional challenge against its possible violation, especially since the scope and coercive nature of the RH mandatory education program could prevent the exercise of these rights.<br><br>Further, I am uneasy to join the <i>ponencia’s</i> conclusion that, at any rate, Section 14 is constitutional. I express misgivings on the constitutionality of this provision, which does not on its face provide for an opt-out clause for parents whose religious beliefs conflict with the State’s program.<br><br><b><i>a.&nbsp; Parental rights in the Filipino context&nbsp; </i></b><br><br>The 1987 Constitution introduced an entire section on the Family that, in essence, recognizes the Filipino family as the foundation of the nation and mandates the State to strengthen its solidarity and actively promote its total development.<br><br>Corollary to the importance that the Constitution gives the Filipino family is the State’s mandate to protect and strengthen it. It is not by coincidence that the Constitution, in requiring the State to protect and strengthen the Filipino family, describes it as a <b><u>basic</u></b> and <b><u>autonomous</u></b> social institution.<br><br>This is a recognition of and deference to the decisional privacy inherent in every family, a recognition that is reflected and reinforced in other provisions of the Constitution: Article II, Section 12 recognizes the “natural and primary right and duty of parents” in rearing the youth; Article XV, Section 3 mandates the State to defend the “right of spouses to found a family in accordance with their religious convictions and the demands of responsible parenthood” and “the right of families or family associations to participate in the planning and implementation of policies and programs that affect them.”<br><br>These constitutional provisions reflect the Filipino ideals and aspirations which the Constitution requires the government to promote and strengthen.

Indeed, alcohol and drugs are societal evils that beget even more evils, such as increases in crime rates and familial discord. The same cannot be said of teenage pregnancies.

This option allows the implementation of the RH education program while respecting parental rights, and saves it from questions of constitutionality.<br><br><b>In these lights, I agree with Justice Mendoza’s conclusion that the challenge to the constitutionality of Section 14 of the RH Law is premature.<br><br>C. Disturbing observation and concerns: The effects on contraceptives on the national, social, cultural and religious values</b><br><br>As I earlier mentioned, the implementation of the RH law cannot but leave lasting imprints on Philippine society, some of them positive and some negative.&nbsp; I do not here question the wisdom of the law, as matters of wisdom and policy are outside judicial realm.&nbsp; I claim judicial license in this regard if I intrude into prohibited territory in the course of expressing disturbing concerns that come to mind.<br><br>The Philippines to be sure, is not the first country to use contraceptives and the mixed results from countries that have long travelled this road are, to my mind, not very encouraging. One obvious discouraging effect of controlled population growth is on the economy of some of these countries which now have to secure foreign labor to balance their finances. This development has been a boon for a country like the Philippines with&nbsp; a fast growing population; we are enjoying now the benefits of our fast-growing&nbsp; population through the returns our migrating Filipino workers bring back to the Philippines from their work in labor-starved countries. This has become possible because host countries like Japan and the more economically advanced European countries need workers to man their industries and supply their economies. Another economic effect is on retirement systems that have been burdened by predominantly aging populations. For this same reason, some countries even face impending economic slowdown in the middle term<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> unless they can effectively remedy their manpower shortage.<br><br>But more than the political and economic consequences, I believe that the RH Law’s implementation could usher in societal and individual behaviors and norms vastly different from the traditional. Already, some of our traditions are giving way, brought about alone by advances in computerization and communication. Factoring in contraceptives and birth control may immeasurably hasten the changes for the worse.<br><br>In the family front alone, the ideals expressed in our Constitution about the Filipino family may soon just be unreachable ideals that we can only long for. Access to modern methods of family planning, unless closely regulated, can shape individual preferences and behavior, that, when aggregated, could lead to entirely different societal perception on sex, marriage, family and parenthood.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>The effect of the RH law on parents’ capacity to influence children about reproductive health could, in a couple of years, produce a generation with very different moral views and beliefs from the parents and the adults of this generation, resulting in a possible schism between the younger and elder members of the family. Their polarized views could lead to the deterioration of the strong ties that bind the Filipino family.<br><br>Contraceptives and birth control devices, distributed even among the young because of lack of stringent control, can lead to a generation of young Filipinos uncaring about the morality of instant sex and irresponsible in their view about pregnancies and the diseases that sexual promiscuity can bring. Even in the near term, this development can affect views about marriage and the rearing of the young.<br><br>For those already married, contraceptives and birth control devices of course offer greater opportunities for sex outside of marriage, both for the husband and the wife. The effects of these outside opportunities on marriage may already be with us. Perhaps, more than at any other time, we have a record number now of separated couples and wrecked marriages, to the prejudice of the family and the children caught in between.<br><br>In hindsight, the 1987 Constitution’s painstaking efforts to include provisions on the family, parenthood and marriage reflect our cultural identity as a Filipino people.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> I do not believe it to be disputable that the heart of the Filipino society is the family. Congress, in introducing innovations to reproductive health might have tried to respect this ideal but I have serious doubts and misgivings on whether we can succeed given the deterioration and erosion in familial values already becoming evident in our society. I hope that in this instance, history would prove me wrong.<br><br><b>D. Freedom of Expression of Health Practitioners and the RH Law&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</b><br><br>I submit that Section 23 (a)(1) of the RH law, which penalizes healthcare providers who “knowingly withhold information or restrict the dissemination thereof, and/or intentionally provide incorrect information regarding programs and services on reproductive health” is an unconstitutional subsequent punishment of speech.<br><br>Broken down to its elements, Section 23(a)(1)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> of the RH law penalizes health care providers who (1) knowingly withhold information about programs and services on reproductive health; (2) knowingly restrict the dissemination of these programs and services; or (3) intentionally provide incorrect information regarding them.<br><br>These prohibited acts are, by themselves, communicative and expressive, and thus constitute speech. Intentionally providing incorrect information cannot be performed without uttering, verbally or otherwise, the information that the RH Law deems to be incorrect. The information that is illegal to withhold or restrict under Section 23 also constitutes speech, as it is an expression of data and opinions regarding reproductive health services and programs; thus, the prerogative to not utter these pieces of information also constitutes speech.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>By penalizing these expressive acts, Section 23 imposes a subsequent punishment on speech, which as a counterpart to the prohibition against prior restraint, is also generally prohibited under the constitutional guarantee of freedom of expression. Without an assurance that speech would not be subsequently penalized, people would hesitate to speak for fear of its consequences; there would be no need for prior restraints because the punishment itself would effectively serve as a chilling effect on speech.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>While I am aware of the state’s interest in regulating the practice of medicine and other health professions, including the communications made in the course of this practice, I believe that Section 23(a)(1) of the RH Law has overreached the permissible coverage of regulation on the speech of doctors and other health professionals.<br><br>Jurisprudence in the United States regarding the speech of medical practitioners has drawn a distinction between speech in the course of their practice of medicine, and speech in public.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> When a doctor speaks to his patient, his speech may be subjected to reasonable regulation by the state to ensure the accuracy of the information he gives his patient and the quality of healthcare he provides.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> But when the doctor speaks to the public, his speech becomes protected speech, and the guarantees against prior restraint and subsequent punishment applies to his expressions that involves medicine or any other topic.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> This distinction is not provided in Section 23(a)(1) of the RH Law, and we cannot create a distinction in the law when it provides none. Thus, <b><i>I submit that Section 23(a)(1) violates the right of health practitioners to speak in public about reproductive health and should simply be struck down.</i></b><br><br>In particular, Section 23 (a)(1) of the RH Law fails to pass the balancing of interests test designed to determine the validity of subsequent punishments that do not involve the state’s interests in national security crimes. Under this test, the Court is tasked to determine which of the competing legitimate interests that the law pits against each other demands the greater protection under particular circumstances.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>In the present case, Section 23(a)(1) of the RH law pits against each other the State’s interest in promoting the health and welfare of women on the one hand, and the freedom of expression of health practitioners, on the other. The Solicitor General, in particular, emphasized the need for Section 23(a)(1) to fulfill the State’s goal to secure the people’s access to full, unbiased and accurate information about reproductive health services.<br><br>While I do not wish to underestimate the State’s interest in providing accurate information on reproductive health, I believe that the freedom of expression of medical health practitioners, particularly in their communications to the public, outweighs this State interest for the following reasons:<br><br><b><i>First</i></b>, we must consider that the RH Law already puts the entire State machinery in providing an all-encompassing, comprehensive, and nationwide information dissemination program on family planning and other reproductive health programs and services. The RH law commands the State to have an official stand on reproductive health care and the full-range of family planning methods it supports, from natural to artificial contraceptives. It then requires the national government to take the lead in the implementation of the information dissemination campaign,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> and local government units to toe the line that the national government draws.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>The RH Law even requires both public and private hospitals to provide a full-range of modern family planning services, including both natural and artificial means. This necessarily means that hospitals (where the health practitioners work) are required by law and under pain of penal punishment, to disseminate information about all available reproductive health services.<br><br>To my mind, this information dissemination program, along with the mandatory requirement for hospitals to provide a full range of family planning services, sufficiently cover the state’s interest in providing accurate information about available reproductive health services and programs.&nbsp; If, corollary to the State’s interest to promote accurate information about reproductive health, it intended to make health care practitioners accountable for any negligence they may commit in the course of their practice, I submit that, as my second argument will further expound, the existing regulatory framework for their practice already sufficiently protects against such negligence and malpractice.<br><br><b><i>Second,</i></b> the existing regulatory framework for the practice of medicine sufficiently penalizes negligence and malpractice, to which the provision of inaccurate information or the withholding of relevant medical information belongs.<br><br>Under our laws, an erring health practitioner may be subjected to three separate proceedings. Depending on the act he or she has committed, the health practitioner may be held criminally and civilly liable by our courts,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> and administratively liable by their professional regulation board.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> For government employees, they can also be held administratively liable under civil service laws.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup><br><br>Thus, I do not see any reason to add another penalty specific to speech that covers reproductive health, especially since, as pointed out earlier, state interests in providing accurate information about RH services are already fully covered.<br><br><b><i>Lastly</i></b>, and what, to me, tips the balance overwhelmingly in favor of speech, the chilling effect that Section 23 (a)(1) creates against the expression of possible ideas, discussions and opinions could eventually hinder progress in the science and research on reproductive health. Health professionals are the most qualified to debate about the efficacy and side effects of reproductive health services, and the penalty against uttering incorrect information about reproductive health services could silence them. Even worse, the requirement for them to provide information on all reproductive health programs of the government could add to the chilling effect, as it sends a signal that the only information on reproductive health that should be considered as correct is that of the government.<br><br>In these lights, I concur with the <i>ponencia’s</i> conclusions, subject to the points I raised in this Separate Opinion.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Section 2, Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution reads:<br><br>Section 2.

The Court upheld the prohibition as being consistent with the State's interest in promoting respect for human life at all stages in the pregnancy. “The medical uncertainty provides a sufficient basis to conclude in this facial attack that the Act does not impose an undue burden.” In <i>US v.

The court denied his request because his prior two felony convictions statutorily excluded him from the discretionary commitment provision of the law. Marshall questioned the denial on due process grounds. The Court denied the challenge. After considering the limited resources to fund the program and the lack of “generally accepted medical view as to the efficacy of presently known therapeutic methods of treating addicts,” the Court said that Congress simply made “a policy choice in an experimental program” that it deems more beneficial to the society.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Section 3(c); Section 4 (c), (d), (q)2; and Section 5, Republic Act (RA) No. 10354.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Under Section 17 a(1) and (3) of RA No. 9710 (An Act Providing for the Magna Carta of Women), women are granted, among others, access to maternal care which includes access to pre-natal and post-natal services to address pregnancy and infant health and nutrition and legal, safe and effective methods of family planning.

The apprehension of the Framers of the constitution that this individualist American ideal of privacy to justify abortion might find their way in our statute books and jurisprudence must be understood in light of this apprehension. What is distinctly noticeable in these American cases that set it apart from the case before us is the <u>reversal of roles between the exercise of governmental power and the assertion of fundamental rights</u>.

That this law has cut deeply into the consciousness and wounded the soul of our nation is evident from the profound depth of conviction with which both proponents and opponents of this law have argued their cause before the bar of public opinion, Congress, and. now, before this Court.<br><br>With the passage of the RH Law, the present case before us is the last remaining obstacle to its implementation.<br><br>The RH Law is primarily a national family planning policy with universal access to contraceptives and informed-free choice as its centerpiece. Its proponents laud the law for what they perceive as a sound and aggressive contraceptive strategy geared towards population control, poverty alleviation, women empowerment, and responsible parenthood. Its opponents, however, deplore the law for what they claim brings about a contraceptive mentality leading to the lowering of moral standards, destruction of marriage and the family, a population winter, and a culture of death.<br><br>The path that we, as a nation, will take has already been decided by Congress, as representatives of the people, under our system of government. The task before the Court, then, is not to say which path we ought to take but to determine if the chosen path treads on unconstitutional grounds. But this is not all. For the Court, which was once generally a passive organ in our constitutional order, has been given expanded powers under the present Constitution. It is now not only its right but its bounden duty to determine grave abuse of discretion on the part of any branch, instrumentality or agency of government,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and, equally important, it has been given the power to issue rules for the protection and enforcement of constitutional rights.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> The Court cannot, therefore, remain an idle spectator or a disinterested referee when constitutional rights are at stake. It is its duty to protect and defend constitutional rights for otherwise its <i>raison d'etre</i> will cease.<br><br>With these considerations in mind, I am of the view that the social gains or ills, whether imagined or real, resulting from the implementation of the RH Law is beyond the scope of judicial review. Thus, even if we assume that the grave and catastrophic predictions of the opponents of the RH Law manifest itself later on, the remedy would lie with Congress to repeal or amend the law. We have entrusted our destiny as a nation to this system of government with the underlying hope that Congress will find the enlightenment and muster the will to change the course they have set under this law should it prove unwise or detrimental to the life of our nation. The battle in this regard remains within the legislative sphere. And there is no obstacle for the1 law's opponents to continue fighting the good fight in the halls of Congress, if they so choose. Thus, the Court will refrain from ruling on the validity of the RH Law based on its wisdom or expediency.<br><br>This is not to say, however, that this law is beyond judicial scrutiny. While I will tackle several constitutional questions presented before this Court in this Opinion, it is my considered view that the paramount issue, which is properly the subject of constitutional litigation, hinges on two vital questions: (1) when does the life of the unborn begin? and (2) how do we ought to protect and defend this life?<br><br>On the first question, I am fully in accord with the result reached by the <i>ponencia</i>. Absent a clear and unequivocal constitutional prohibition on the manufacture, distribution, and use of contraceptives, there is nothing to prevent Congress from adopting a national family planning policy <i>provided</i> that the contraceptives that will be used pursuant thereto do not harm or destroy the life of the unborn from conception, which is synonymous to fertilization, under Article II, Section 12<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> of the Constitution. The plain meaning of this constitutional provision and the deliberations of the Constitutional Commission bare this out.<br><br>It is upon the answer to the second question, however, where I find myself unable to fully agree with the <i>ponencia</i>. Congress accomplished a commendable undertaking when it passed the RH Law with <i>utmost respect</i> for the life of the unborn from conception/fertilization. Indeed, this law is replete with provisions seeking to protect and uphold the right to life of the unborn in consonance with the Constitution.<br><br>However, where the task of Congress ends, the Court's charge begins for it is mandated by the Constitution to protect and defend constitutional rights. With the impending implementation of the RH Law, the Court cannot turn a blind eye when the right to life of the unborn may be imperiled or jeopardized. Within its constitutionally-mandated role as guardian and defender of constitutional rights, in general, and its expanded power to issue rules for the protection and enforcement of such rights, in particular, the Court may, thus, issue such orders as are necessary and essential to protect, defend and enforce the right to life of the unborn.<br><br>The framers of, and the people who ratified the Constitution set in bold and deft strokes the protection of the life of the unborn from conception/fertilization because it is <i>precious, sacred</i> and <i>inviolable</i>. For as long as this precept remains written in our Constitution, our solemn duty is to stay the course in fidelity to the most cherished values and wisdom of those who came before us and to whom we entrusted the writing and ratification of our Constitution. History will judge this Court on what it did or did not do to protect the life of the unborn from conception/fertilization. There is, therefore, no other recourse but for this Court to act in defense of the life of the unborn.<br><br>These reasons primarily impel the writing of this Opinion.<br><br><i>Deliberations of the Constitutional <br>Commission on Article II, Section 12<br>of the Constitution.&nbsp; </i><br><br>Article II, Section 1.2 of the Constitution provides, in part:<br><br><blockquote>Section 12. The State recognizes the sanctity of family life and shall protect and strengthen the family as a basic autonomous social institution. It shall equally protect the life of the mother and the life of the unborn <b>from conception</b>, xxx (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Article II, Section 12 of the present Constitution was originally Article II, Section 9 of the draft of the Constitution:<br><br><blockquote>Section 9. The State recognizes the sanctity of family life and shall protect and strengthen the family as a basic social institution. The State shall equally protect the life of the mother and the life of the unborn <b>from the moment of conception</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> x x x (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The draft of the Constitution was slightly differently worded as it made use of the phrase "from the moment of conception" while its present wording is "from conception." The change in wording, as will be discussed later, was to simplify the phraseology. But the intended meaning of both phrases, as deliberated by the Constitutional Commission, is the same.<br><br>The background and basis of the subject constitutional provision were explained in the sponsorship speech of Commissioner Villegas. He emphasized that, based on incontrovertible scientific evidence, the fertilized ovum is alive; that this life is human; and that the fertilized ovum is a human person. Though that last point, he acknowledged, was highly contested in law. Commissioner Villegas went on to discuss why abortion could not be justified even in so-called hard cases such as pregnancies resulting from rape or incest; pregnancies of mentally ill mothers; and pregnancies of mothers mired in abject poverty.<br><br>The justification for disallowing abortion in hard cases sets the tone on the nature of the right to life of the unborn, as a fundamental right, that recurs throughout the deliberations:<br><br><blockquote>The main reason why we should say "no" (to abortion in hard cases) are: (1) a wrong cannot be righted by another wrong, (2) no one should be deprived of human life <b>without due process</b> and we have established scientifically that from the moment of conception, the fertilized ovum has already life; and (3) a fetus, just like any human, must be <b>presumed innocent unless proven guilty</b>. It is quite obvious that the fetus has done no wrong. Its only wrong is to be an unwanted baby.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Commissioner Villegas would later re-emphasize this' point at the end of his sponsorship speech, thus:<br><br><blockquote>What is being affirmed in this formulation is the <b>moral right</b> as well as the <b>constitutional right of the unborn child to life</b>, x x x The views I express here transcend religious differences. As I have declared in another occasion, this is not a Roman Catholic position. Since time immemorial, even before Christianity was brought to our soil, as you very well know, our ancestors referred to the baby in the womb of the mother as tao— siya'y nagdadalang-tao. Ang dinadala ay tao; hindi halaman, hindi hayop, hindi palaka— tao.<br><br>Madam President, let me also quote from a non-Christian in. our Commission. In a public hearing, the honorable Commissioner Uka said the following: "As a Muslim, I believe in,the Ten Commandments, and one of the Ten Commandments is "Thou shalt not kill," From the time of conception, there is already life. Now if you put down that life, there is already killing, a violation of one of the Ten Commandments. The overwhelming majority of Filipinos agree with Commissioner Uka that we should support Section 9. We have received up to now more man 50,000 signatures from all over the Philippines, from individuals belonging to all walks of life. I do not think there is any other issue in which we have been bombarded with, more numerous, signatures. Let us, therefore, listen to all of them and mandate that the State should equally protect the life of the mother and the unborn from the moment of conception.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Subsequently, Commissioner Nolledo would re-echo these views:<br><br><blockquote>Killing the fetus, while categorized as abortion in our Revised Penal Code, is plain murder because of its inability to defend itself. Let the unborn, Madam President, the unborn which is cherished, precious and loving gift of God, enjoy constitutional protection in a Christian country like ours.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[8]</sup></font></blockquote><br>The subject constitutional, provision, thus, sought to <i>recognize</i> the right to life of the unborn as a fundamental right. As Commissioner Padilla observed:<br><br><blockquote>Madam President, after the sponsorship of Commissioner Villegas on Section 9, I wanted to state that I fully concur with his views in support of Section 9 on the right of the unborn from conception. I found his exposition to be logical, not necessarily creative, much less critical, but logical. Madam President, I would like to state that the Revised Penal Code does not only penalize infanticide but it has various provisions penalizing abortion; Article 256, intentional abortion; Article 257, unintentional abortion; Article 258, abortion practiced by the woman herself or by her parents; and Article 259, abortion practiced by a physician or midwife and dispensing of abortives.<br><br>However, I believe the intention of the proponents of Section 9 is not only to affirm this punitive provision in the Penal Code <b>but to make clear that it is a fundamental right that deserves to be mentioned in the Constitution</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br>(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The unique status of the fundamental right accorded to the unborn was explored in later discussions. It was emphasized that the subject constitutional provision was intended to protect only the right to life of the unborn unlike the human person who enjoys the right to life, liberty and property:<br><br><blockquote>MR. SUAREZ. Going to these unborn children who will be given protection from the moment of conception, does the Commissioner have in mind giving them also proprietary rights, like the right to inheritance?<br><br>MR. VILLEGAS. No, Madam President. Precisely, the question of whether or not that unborn is a legal person who can acquire property is completely a secondary question. <b>The only right that we want to protect from the moment of conception is the right to life, which is the beginning of all other rights.</b><br><br>MR. SUAREZ. So, only the right to life,<br><br>MR. VILLEGAS. Yes, it is very clear, only the right to life.<br><br>MR.

That is right, Madam President.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The deliberations also revealed that the subject constitutional provision was intended to prevent the Court from making a <i>Roe v. Wade</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> ruling in our jurisdiction:<br><br><blockquote>MR. VILLEGAS. Yes, Madam President. As Commissioner Padilla already said, it is important that we have a constitutional provision that is more basic than the existing laws. In countries like the United States, they get involved in some ridiculous internal contradictions in their laws when they give the child the right to damages received while yet unborn, to inheritance, to blood transfusion over its mother's objection, to have a guardian appointed and other rights of citizenship; but they do not give him the right to life.<br><br>As has happened after that infamous 1972 U.S. Supreme Court decision (Roe v. Wade), babies can be killed, all the way up to 8 and 8 ½ months. So precisely this basic provision is necessary because inferior laws are sometimes imperfect and completely distorted. We have to make sure that the basic law will prevent all of these internal contradictions found in American jurisprudence because Filipino lawyers very often cite American jurisprudence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>xxxx<br><br>MR. VILLEGAS. As I have said, we must prevent any possibility of legalized abortion, because there is enough jurisprudence that may be used by Congress or by our Supreme Court.<br><br>Let me just read what happened after the <i>Roe v. Wade</i> decision in the U.S. Supreme Court, x x x<br><br>So, these are the floodgates that are open?<br><br>REV. RIGOS. Which are?<br><br>MR. VILLEGAS. As I said, American jurisprudence looms large on Philippine practice and because it is a transcendental issue, we have to completely remove the possibility of our Congress and our Supreme Court following this tragic trail.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></blockquote><br>There was, thus, a clear rejection of the theory used in <i>Roe v. Wade</i> that the test of human personality was viability. Further, the subject constitutional provision was intended to prohibit Congress from legalizing abortion:<br><br><blockquote>MR. VILLEGAS. "Protection" means any attempt on the life of the child from the moment of conception can be considered abortion and can, be criminal.<br><br>MR. SUAREZ. So, principally and exclusively, if I may say so, what the Commissioner has in mind is only an act outlawing abortion.<br><br>MR. VILLEGAS. Exactly, Madam President.<br><br>MR. SUAREZ.&nbsp; So that is the real thrust and meaning of this particular provision.<br><br>MR. VILLEGAS. That is right.<br><br>MR. SUAREZ. Can we not just spell it out in our Constitution that abortion, is outlawed, without stating the right to life of the unborn from the moment of conception, Madam President?<br><br>MR. VILLEGAS. No, because that would already be getting into the legal technicalities. That is already legislation. The moment we have this provision, all laws making abortion possible would be unconstitutional. That is the purpose of this provision, Madam President.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>x x x x<br><br>MR. NATIVIDAD. Madam President, I rose to ask these questions because I had the impression that this provision of the Constitution would prevent future Congresses from enacting laws legalizing abortion. Is my perception correct, Madam President?<br><br>MR. VILLEGAS. Exactly. Congress cannot legalize abortion. It would be unconstitutional.<br><br>MR. NATIVEDAD. In what way will it collide with this provision?<br><br>MR. VILLEGAS. Any direct killing of the unborn from 'the moment of conception would be going against the Constitution and, therefore, that law would be, if Congress attempts to make it legal, unconstitutional.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></blockquote><br>The sole exception to this constitutional prohibition against abortion is when there is a need, in rare cases, to save the life of the mother which indirectly sacrifices the unborn's life under the principle of double effect:<br><br><blockquote>MR. BENNAGEN. In making a decision as to which life takes priority, the life of the mother or the life of the unborn, what criteria are contemplated by the committee on which to base the decision?<br><br>MR. VILLEGAS. We have articulated this moral principle called the principle of double effect. Whenever there is need, for example, to perform a surgical operation on the mother because of a disease or some organic malfunctioning, then the direct intention is to save the mother. And if indirectly the child's life has to be sacrificed, that would not be abortion, that would not be killing. So, in those situations which we said are becoming rarer and rarer because of the tremendous advance of medical science, the mother's life is safe.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Intricately related to the prohibition of legalizing abortion was the intention to prevent Congress, through future legislation, from defining when life begins other than at the time of fertilization:<br><br><blockquote>MR. DAVIDE. Precisely. So, insofar as the unborn is concerned, life begins at the first moment of conception. <b>Therefore, there is no need to delete. There is no need to leave it to Congress because that is a matter settled in medicine.</b><br><br>xxxx<br><br>REV. RIGOS. Yes, we think that the word "unborn" is sufficient for the purpose of writing a Constitution, without specifying "from the moment of conception.<br><br>MR. DAVIDE. I would not subscribe to that particular view because according to the Commissioner's own admission, he would leave it to Congress to define when life begins. So, Congress can define life to begin from six months after fertilization; and that would really be very, very dangerous. It is now determined by science that life begins from the moment of conception. There can be no doubt about it. <b>So, we should not give any doubt to Congress, too.</b><br><br>Thank you, Madam President. (<i>Applause</i>)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Much of the debates, however, centered on the meaning of the phrase "from the moment of conception." It is clear from the deliberations that the intended meaning of the phrase "from the moment of conception" was fertilization or the moment the egg is fertilized by the sperm.<br><br><blockquote>REV. RIGOS. In Section 9, page 3, there is a sentence which reads:<br><br>The State shall equally protect the life of the mother and the life of the unborn from the moment of conception.<br><br>When is the moment of conception?<br><br>x x x x<br><br>MR. VILLEGAS. As I explained in the sponsorship speech, <b>it is when the ovum is fertilized by the sperm that there is human life</b>. Just to repeat: first, there is obviously life because it starts to nourish itself, it starts to grow as any living being, and it is human because at the moment of fertilization, the chromosomes that combined in the fertilized ovum are the chromosomes that are uniquely found in human beings and are not found in any other living being.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[18]</sup></font> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Significantly, the framers intentionally made use of the term "from the moment of conception" so that the people who will ratify the Constitution would easily understand its meaning:<br><br><blockquote>MR. TINGSON. We would like Commissioner Rigos to know that the phrase "from the moment of conception" was described by us here before with the scientific phrase "fertilized ovum." However, we figured in the committee that the phrase "fertilized ovum" may be beyond the comprehension of some people; we want to use the simpler phrase "from the moment of conception."<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[19]</sup></font></blockquote><br>During the deliberations, the meaning of "from the moment of conception" was <i>repeatedly </i>reaffirmed as pertaining to the fertilization of the egg by the sperm. As a necessary consequence of this definition, any drug or device that harms the unborn from the moment of fertilization is considered an abortifacient and should be banned by the State:<br><br><blockquote>MR. GASCON. Mr. Presiding Officer, I would like to ask a question on that point. Actually that is one of the questions I was going to raise during the period of interpellations but it has been expressed already. The provision, as it is proposed right now, states:<br><blockquote>The State shall equally protect the life of the mother and the life of the unborn from the moment of conception.</blockquote>When it speaks of "from the moment of conception," does this mean when the egg meets the sperm?<br><br>MR. VILLEGAS. Yes, the ovum, is fertilized by the sperm.<br><br>MR. GASCON. Therefore, that does not leave to Congress the right to determine whether certain contraceptives that we know of today are abortifacient or not because it is a fact that some of these so-called contraceptives deter the rooting of the fertilized ovum in the uterus. If fertilization has already occurred, the next process is for the fertilized ovum to travel towards the uterus and to take root. What happens with some contraceptives is that they stop the opportunity for the fertilized ovum to reach the uterus. Therefore, if we take the provision as it is proposed, these so-called contraceptives should be banned.<br><br>MR.

In other words, there was a move to delete the phrase "from, the moment of conception." Opponents. of the subject constitutional provision argued mat the determination of when life begins should be left to Congress to address in a future legislation where there is greater opportunity to debate the issues dealing with human personality and when it begins.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>After a lengthy exchange, the proponents of the subject constitutional provision scored a decisive victory when the final voting on whether to retain or delete the phrase "from the moment of conception" was held:<br><br><blockquote>THE PRESIDENT, x x x So, if the vote is "yes", it is to delete "from the moment of conception."

Subsequently, the Padilla amendment was put to a vote. With a vote of 33 in favor, 3 against, and 4 abstentions, the Padilla amendment was approved. Thus, the present wording of the second sentence of Article II, Section 12 of the Constitution makes use of the simplified phrase "from conception."<br><br><i>Key Characteristics of Article II, Section 12</i><br><br>Several important characteristics or observations may be made on the nature, scope and significance of Article II, Section 12 of the Constitution relative to the protection of the life of the unborn based on the deliberations of the Constitutional Commission.<br><br>First, the framers were unequivocal in their intent to define "conception" as the fertilization of the egg by the sperm and to' accord constitutional protection to the life of the unborn from the moment of fertilization. The plain meaning of the term "conception," as synonymous to fertilization, based on dictionaries and medical textbooks, as aptly and extensively discussed by the <i>ponencia</i>, confirm this construction. In addition, petitioners correctly argue that the definition of "conception," as equivalent to fertilization, was the same definition prevailing during the 1980's or at around the time the 1987 Constitution was ratified.26 Hence, under the rule of constitutional construction, which gives weight to how the term was understood by the people who ratified the Constitution, "conception" should be understood as fertilization.<br><br>Second, the protection of the life of the unborn under Article II, Section 12<br><br>is a self-executing provision because:<br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="CENTER">(1)</div></td> <td width="90%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">It prevents Congress from legalizing abortion; from passing laws which authorize the use of abortifacients; and from passing laws which will determine when life begins other than from the moment of conception/fertilization; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">(2)</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">It prevents the Supreme Court from making a <i>Roe v.

The framers repeatedly treated or referred to the right to life of the unborn as a fundamental right and thereby acknowledged that the unborn is a proper subject of a constitutional right. That this right is founded on natural law and is self-executing further provides the unmistakable basis and intent to accord, it the status of a constitutional right. However, it is <i>sui generis</i> because, unlike a person who possesses the right to life, liberty and property, the unborn's fundamental right is solely limited to the right to life as was the intention of the framers. Clearly, then, Article II, Section 12 recognized a <i>sui generis</i> right to life of the unborn from conception/fertilization and elevated it to the status of a constitutional right.<br><br>Fourth, because the unborn has been accorded a constitutional right to life from conception/fertilization under Article II, Section 12, this right falls within the ambit of the Court's power to issue rules for the protection and enforcement of constitutional rights under Article VIII, Section 5(5) of the Constitution:<br><br><blockquote>Sections. The Supreme Court shall have the following powers:<br><br>xxxx<br><br>(5) Promulgate rules concerning the protection and enforcement of constitutional rights, x x x. Rules of procedure, of special courts and quasi-judicial bodies shall remain effective unless disapproved by the Supreme Court.</blockquote><br>This is <i>significant </i>because it imposes upon this Court the duty to protect such right pursuant to its rule-making powers. In recent times, the Court acknowledged that the right of the people to a balanced and healthful ecology in accord with the rhythm and harmony of nature under Article II, Section. 16 of the Constitution, though found in the Declaration of Principles and Policies (like the subject right to life of the unborn) and not in the Bill of Rights, may be given flesh pursuant to the power of the Court to issue rules for the protection and enforcement of constitutional rights. It, thus, proceeded to promulgate the rules governing the Writ of <i>Kalikasan</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>With <i>far</i> greater reason should the Court wield this power here because the unborn is totally defenseless and must rely wholly on the State to represent its interest in-matters affecting the protection and preservation of its very life. It does not necessarily follow, however, that the Court should issue a set of rules to protect the life of the unborn like the Writ of <i>Kalikasan</i>. How the Court is to protect and enforce the constitutional right to life of the unborn, within the context of the RH Law, is the central theme of this Opinion.<br><br>With the groundwork constitutional principles in place, I now proceed to tackle the constitutionality of the RH Law and its Implementing Rules and Regulations (ERR).<br><br><i>The RH Law does not contravene Article II, <br>Section 12 of the Constitution.</i><br><br>The RH Law prohibits the use of abortifacients hi several provisions in consonance with Article II, Section 12 of the Constitution, to wit:<br><br>(1)&nbsp; Section 2:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 2. <i>Declaration of Policy</i>. - x x x<br><br>The State likewise guarantees universal access to medically-safe, <b>non-abortifacient</b>, effective, legal, affordable, and quality reproductive health care services, methods, devices, supplies <b>which do not prevent the implantation of a fertilized ovum</b> as determined by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and relevant information and education thereon according to the priority needs of women, children and other underprivileged sectors, giving preferential access to those identified through the National Household Targeting System for Poverty Reduction (NHTS-PR) and oilier government measures of identifying marginalizalion, who shall be voluntary beneficiaries of reproductive health care, services and supplies for free.

(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The key provision is found in Section 4(a) which defines an "abortifacient" as "any drug or device that induces abortion or the destruction of a fetus inside the mother's womb or the prevention of the fertilized ovum to reach and be implanted in the mother's womb upon determination of the FDA." That last phrase which effectively bans contraceptives that prevent the fertilized ovum from reaching and being implanted in the mother's womb guarantees that the fertilized ovum will not be harmed or destroyed from the moment of fertilization until its implantation. Thus, the RH Law protects the unborn from conception/fertilization in consonance with the Constitution.<br><br>As earlier noted, the RH Law is to be commended for its zealous protection of the life of the unborn from conception/fertilization. It repeatedly emphasizes that the contraceptives which will be made available under the law should be non-abortifacient. It prohibits the use of abortifacients and penalizes the use thereof. Thus, it cannot be said that: the law violates Article II, Section 12 of the Constitution.<br><br><i>The IRR's definition of "abortifacient"<br>and "contraceptive" contravenes Article <br>II, Section 12 of the Constitution and, <br>the RH Law itself.</i><br><br>Petitioners Alliance for the Family Foundation Philippines, Inc.

As defined in the IRR, a drug or device is considered an abortifacient if it "primarily" induces abortion or the destruction of a fetus inside the mother's womb or the prevention of the fertilized ovum to reach and be implanted in the mother's womb; where "primarily" means that the drug or device has no other known effect aside from abortion. In other words, under the IRR, a contraceptive will only be considered as an "abortifacient" if its sole known effect is abortion or, as pertinent here, the prevention of the implantation of the fertilized ovum.<br><br>Consequently, a drug or device which (a) prevents fertilization, (b) but does not provide a 100% guarantee of such prevention, and (c) has a fail-safe mechanism which will prevent the implantation of the fertilized ovum in case fertilization still occurs will not be considered an "abortifacient" because the known effect thereof is not solely prevention of implantation since (1) it primarily prevents fertilization and (2) only secondarily prevents the implantation of the fertilized ovum in case fertilization still occurs.<br><br>However, a drug or device that cannot provide a 100% guarantee that it will prevent fertilization <b><u>and</u></b> has a fail-safe mechanism which prevents implantation of the fertilized ovum (or harming/destroying the fertilized ovum in any way) if fertilization occurs is unconstitutional under Article II, Section 12 and must be banned by the State. In more concrete terms, if a drug or device provides only a 90% guarantee of prevention of fertilization, then there is a 10% chance mat fertilization will still occur and the fertilized ovum would be destroyed by the fail­safe mechanism of the contraceptive.<br><br><i>We cannot play the game of probabilities when life is at stake.</i> The destruction or loss of life is permanent and irrevocable. Our constitutional mandate is to protect the life of the unborn from conception/fertilization. We cannot protect this life 90% of the time and allow its destruction 10% of the time. We either protect this life or we do not. There is nothing in between.<br><br>If we are to truly give flesh to the constitutional precept that the life of the unborn from conception/fertilization is precious, sacred and inviolable, all reasonable doubts should be resolved in favor of the protection and preservation of the life of the unborn, and any probability of destruction or loss of such life be absolutely proscribed. The supreme law of the land commands no less.<br><br>For parallel reasons, the IRR's definition of "contraceptive" under Section 3.01(j) is unconstitutional because of the insertion of the qualifier "primarily," to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Section 3.01 For purposes of these Rules, the terms shall be defined as follows:<br><br>xxxx<br><br>j) <i>Contraceptive</i> refers to any safe, legal, effective and scientifically proven modern family planning method, device, or health product, whether natural or artificial, that prevents pregnancy but does not<b> primarily</b> destroy a fertilized ovum or prevent a fertilized ovum from being implanted in the mother's womb in do.ses of its approved indication as determined by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Although the RH Law does not provide a definition of "contraceptive," a reasonable and logical deduction is that "contraceptive" (or allowable contraceptive to be more precise) is the opposite of "abortifacient" as defined under the RH Law. This seems to be the tack adopted by the IRR in defining "contraceptive." However, the IRR's definition of "contraceptive" again added the qualifier "primarily." For similar reasons with the previous discussion on the IRR's definition of "abortifacient," this definition of "contraceptive" opens the floodgates to the approval of contraceptives which are actually abortifacients because of their fail-safe mechanism. Hence, the qualifier "primarily" in Section 3.01(j) is, likewise, void.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, the word "primarily" in Section 3.01 (a) and (j) of the IRR should be declared void for (1) contravening Section 4(a) of the RH Law and (2) violating Article II, Section 12 of Constitution.<br><br><i>Within the framework of implementation<br>of the RH Law, it is necessary for this <br>Court to exercise its expanded jurisdiction <br>and power to issue rules for the protection<br>and enforcement of constitutional rights in <br>order to adequately protect the right to life<br>of the unborn.</i><br><br>The Court should not limit its scrutiny to the constitutional validity of the RH Law and its IRR. This is because the right to life of the unborn from conception/fertilization, is a constitutional right properly within the ambit of the Court's power to issue rules for the protection and enforcement of constitutional rights under Article VIII, Section 5(5) of the Constitution. In Echegaray v.

This Court for the first time was given the power to promulgate rules concerning the protection and enforcement of constitutional rights. The Court was also granted for the first time the power to disapprove rules of procedure of special courts and quasi-judicial bodies, xxx</blockquote><br>Viewed in light of the broad power of the Court to issue rules for the protection and enforcement of constitutional rights, the power to disapprove the rules of procedure of quasi-judicial bodies is significant in that it implies the power of the Court to look into the sufficiency of such rules of procedure insofar as they adequately protect and enforce constitutional rights. Moreover, the power to disapprove the aforesaid rules of procedure necessarily includes or implies the power to approve or modify such rules or, on the one extreme, require that such rules of procedure be issued when necessary to protect and enforce constitutional rights, hi other words, within and between the broader power to issue rules for the protection and. enforcement of constitutional rights and the narrower power to disapprove the rules of procedure of quasi-judicial bodies, there exist penumbras of this power that the Court may exercise in order to protect and enforce constitutional rights.<br><br>Furthermore, the power to determine when the aforesaid powers may be exercised should be understood in. conjunction with the Court's expanded jurisdiction, under Article VIII, Section 1&nbsp; of the Constitution, to determine "whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government."<br><br>Taken together, the expanded jurisdiction of the Court and the power to issue rules for the protection and enforcement of constitutional rights provide the bases for the Court (1) to look into the sufficiency of safeguards in the implementation of the RH Law insofar as it will adversely affect the right to life of the unborn, and (2) to issue such orders as are necessary and essential in order to protect and enforce the constitutional right to life of the unborn. This is especially true in this case because the expanded powers of the Court was granted to it to prevent a repeat of the bitter experiences during martial law years when rampant human rights violations occurred. Verily, the expanded powers were conferred on this Court at a great price and were given for a clear purpose. Here, a more basic right—the right to life of the unborn— is at stake; the right from which all human rights emanate.<br><br>It should come as no surprise that at a time our nation is set to embark on a great social experiment, where the fall machinery of the State will be utilized to implement an aggressive national family planning policy, the Court should find itself reflecting on the threshold of its constitutionally-mandated powers. The Court is beckoned to courageously sail forth to the new frontiers of its powers in order to stem the tide of oppression, nay destruction, against a <i>most </i>vulnerable group that may be trampled upon by this great social experiment.

Noche:<br>Yes, Your Honor.<br><br>Justice Del Castillo:<br>You have identified contraceptives as abortifacient.<br><br>Atty. Noche:<br>Yes, Your Honor.<br><br>Justice Del Castillo:<br>There are so many contraceptives and the respondents have taken the view that not all are abortifacients. So to resolve this issue, why don't you identify, why don't you name these contraceptives and then let's test them if they are abortifacient then the issue is settled, so instead of making generalization that all contraceptives are abortifacient, don't you think that the proper course of action to take is to identify all these because practically all drugs are abortifacients, even a simple aspirin, so these tire [as a] matter of degree. So, perhaps those that would cause tremendous harm and maybe we can ban them. But unless we have not identified them just to say that all abortifacients, don't' you think that.....<br><br>Atty. Noche:<br>If Your Honor, please, hormonal contraceptives, what we're saying is that hormonal contraceptives which include, you know, the pills, and the injectables, and intrauterine devices, Your Honor, and the patches, Your Honor, implants they're proven to be abortifacients, Your Honor. Vasectomy, sterilization procedures, Your Honor, they are also referred to as contraceptives, Your Honor, but they are not abortifacients because they don't contain hormones. Your Honor.<br><br>Justice Del Castillo:<br>No, I was suggesting that because the respondents would also come out with their own authorities, so to resolve it once and for all, let's test them.<br><br>Atty. Noche:<br>If Your Honor, please, we also have an objection about giving, of course, I'm sure, Your Honor, I've been referring to delegating the authority to the Food and Drug Administration, so we have a problem with that, Your Honor, because, I mean, these hormonal contraceptives are proven to be abortifacients. Your Honor, and.... (interrupted)<br><br>Justice Del Castillo:<br>I am not just referring to the Food and Drug Administration. My point is, let's put it to test because this is just x x x evidentiary, it's a matter of fact, we cannot make generalizations. [They're] saying that these are not abortifacients, you are saying x x x that they are abortifacients, then let's prove it That is just my suggestion.<br><br>Atty. Noche:<br>If Your Honor, please, may I, you know, bring out the very important point that we have always tried to bring out, Your Honor. Section 12, otherwise, we forget this, Section 12, Article II mandates the protection of the unborn from conception. And that protection is not just from death but from any risks or threat of harm, or injury or any form or degree, remote or direct, momentary or permanent and it has proven already mat anything, Your Honor, that you introduce into the body that disrupts the, you know, workings in the uterus or the physiology in the uterus is harmful to the fertilized ovum so.......... (interrupted)<br><br>Justice Del Castillo:<br>Yes, Counsel, but the protection comes in only after, if I may grant you, the fertilization. But before that, the unborn is not protected, the unborn is protected from conception so before that it's not [a] regulated act.<br><br>Atty. Noche:<br>If Your Honor, please, before fertilization there is no person to speak of.<br><br>Justice Del Castillo:<br>Exactly.<br><br>Atty.

It is also only proper that the Court accords deference to this legislative delegation of powers to the FDA for this purpose. However, for obvious reasons, the unborn cannot appear, on its behalf, to represent or protect its interest, bearing upon its very right to life, when the FDA proceeds to make such a determination.<br><br>Within this framework of implementation, and given the unique status of the unborn and the exceptional need, to protect its right to life, the Court <i>must</i> step in by directing the FDA to issue the <i>proper</i> rules of procedure in the determination of whether a drug or device is an abortifacient under the RH Law. Such rules must <i>sufficiently</i> safeguard the right to life of the unborn. As a penumbra of its power to issue rules to protect and enforce constitutional rights and its power to disapprove rules of procedure of quasi-judicial bodies, the Court has the power and competency to mandate the minimum requirements of due process in order to sufficiently safeguard the right to life of the unborn in the proceedings that will be conducted before the FDA. This is in line with the declared policy and numerous provisions of the RH Law according <i>utmost</i> respect and protection for the right to life of the unborn.<br><br>In determining whether a drug or device is an abortifacient, the FDA will necessarily engage in a quasi-judicial function. It will determine whether a set of facts (active properties or mechanisms of a drug or device) comply with a legal standard (definition of non-abortifacient) which will ultimately bear upon the right to life of the unborn. Considering that quasi-judicial bodies involved in, say, rate-fixing follow the due process requirements of publication, notice and hearing, where the lesser right to property is involved, then with far greater reason should the proceedings before the FDA require publication, notice and hearing.<br><br>Any erroneous determination the FDA makes can result to the destruction or loss of the life of the unborn. Plainly, the life and death of countless, faceless imborns hang in the balance. Thus, the determination should be made with <i>utmost care</i> where the interest of the unborn is <i>adequately represented.</i><br><br>Consequently, the Solicitor General should be mandated to represent the unborn and the State's interest in the protection of the life of the unborn from conception/fertilization in the proceedings before the FDA. If the Solicitor General is made to represent the State's interest in, say, cases involving declaration of nullity of marriage, then, again, with<i> far</i> greater reason, should it be made to represent the unborn and State's interest in protecting the life of the unborn. Interested parties should also be allowed to intervene in the proceedings for all persons have a valid and substantial interest in the protection of the right to life of the unborn under the concept of intergenerational responsibility.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>In making the aforesaid determination, the FDA should follow the strict standards laid down in the Constitution, as adopted in the RH Law, as to what constitute allowable contraceptives. The IRR has provided guidelines as to what constitute allowable contraceptives but these guidelines should be applied only insofar as they do not contravene the standard laid down in the Constitution. Given the advances in science and medicine, drugs or devices may be developed which satisfy the guidelines in the IRR but still result to the destruction of the unborn from fertilization. (This was the case with the contraceptive with a fail-safe mechanism which required the voiding of the subject qualifiers in the IRR's definition of terms, as previously discussed.)<br><br><i>The Constitution is always the polestar</i>, the drug or device should not harm or destroy the life of the unborn from conception/fertilization.

There are currently fifty-nine (59) contraceptive drugs and seven (7) intrauterine devices duly approved for sale by the FDA and currently available in the market x x x"</blockquote><br>However, the Solicitor General did not categorically state that these drugs and devices were screened, evaluated and/or tested under the standard laid down in Article II, Section 12 of the Constitution, as adopted under Section 4(a) of RH Law. The apparent reason for this seems to be that these dings and devices were screened, evaluated and/or tested by the FDA <i>prior to</i> the enactment of the RH Law and the ruling that the Court now categorically makes in this case.<br><br>Plainly, it would not make sense to impose strict rules of procedure for the evaluation of contraceptives that will be used under the RH Law while allowing a <i>possible</i> continuing violation of the Constitution relative to contraceptive dings and devices that were previously approved by the FDA and are currently being used and/or distributed in our jurisdiction.<br><br>There is, thus, an <i>urgent necessity </i>to determine if the aforesaid contraceptive drugs and devices comply with the Constitution and RH Law, i.e. they do not harm or destroy the unborn from conception/fertilization, in general, and they do not prevent the implantation of the fertilized ovum, in particular. Also, of particular significance is whether the FDA evaluated the currently available contraceptive drugs and devices against the standard laid down, as discussed in a previous subsection, concerning unallowable contraceptives which (1) do not provide a 100% guarantee of preventing fertilization and (2) has a fail-safe mechanism which destroys the fertilized ovum if fertilization occurs (e.g., prevents the implantation of the fertilized ovum on the uterus).<br><br>Thus, the FDA should be ordered to immediately inform this Court whether its previously approved and the currently available contraceptive dings and devices in our jurisdiction <i>were</i> screened, evaluated and/or tested against the afore-discussed general and specific standards. It should be emphasized that the FDA is <i>not</i> being asked to re-screen, re-evaluate or re-test the aforesaid contraceptive drugs and devices but only to inform this Court if they <i>were</i> screened, evaluated and/or tested against the constitutional and statutory standards that the Court upholds in this decision. Thus, this will not take an inordinate amount of time to do considering that the files should be readily available with the FDA. This information will allow the Court to take immediate remedial action in order to protect and defend the life of the unborn from conception/fertilization, if the circumstances warrant. That is, if the contraceptive drugs or devices <i>were not</i> screened, evaluated and/or tested against the constitutional and statutory standards that (lie Court upholds in this decision, then it would be necessary to suspend their availability in the market, as a precautionary measure, in order to protect the right to life of the unborn <i>pending</i> the proper screening, evaluation and/or testing through the afore-discussed rules of procedure that the FDA is directed to issue..<br><br>It should be noted that Section 7.05 of the IRR<i> effectively </i>and <i>impliedly </i>mandates that these existing drugs and devices be screened, evaluated and/or tested <i>again</i> by the FDA against the standard or definition of abortifacient under Section 4(a) of the RFI Law. But the serious flaw in this procedure is that, in the meantime, the aforesaid drugs and devices shall remain available in the market pending the FDA's certification, to wit:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 7.05</b> <i>Drugs, Supplies, and Products with Existing Certificates of Product Registration.</i> Upon the effectivity of these Rules, all reproductive health care drugs, supplies, and products that have existing Certificates of Product Registration (CPRs).from the FDA shall be provided certifications stating that they do not cause abortion when taken in dosages for their approved indications.</blockquote><br>Thus, if such drugs and devices, are later determined by the FDA to be an abortifacient under the standard laid down in the Constitution, as adopted under the RFI Law, then the loss or destruction of many unborn may have already resulted or taken place. As previously noted, the proper course of action is to immediately determine if they were screened, evaluated and/or tested against the afore-discussed general and specific constitutional and statutory standards. And, if not, to immediately suspend their availability in the market, as a precautionary measure, in order to safeguard the right to life of the unborn pending the proper screening, evaluation and/or testing through the afore-discussed rules of procedure that the FDA is directed to issue.<br><br>The life of the unborn should not be placed at risk any minute longer.<br><br><i>The DOH in coordination with all<br>concerned government agencies should <br>be directed to formulate the rules and<br>regulations or guidelines that will govern <br>the purchase and distribution/ dispensation<br>of the product or supply which will be <br>covered by the FDA's certification, under<br>Section 9 of the Mi Law, that said product<br>and supply is made available on the condition<br>that it is not to be used as an abortifacient.</i><br><br>Section 9 of the RH Law states—<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 9. <i>The Philippine National Drug Formulary System and Family Planning Supplies</i>. - The National Drug Formulary shall include hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine devices, injectables and other safe, legal, non-abortifacient and effective family planning products and supplies.

(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Preliminarily, the necessity of imposing proper rules of procedure, which sufficiently safeguards the right to life of the unborn, in the FDA's determination of what will be considered allowable contraceptive drugs and devices upon implementation of the RH Law, can be better appreciated if viewed within the context of Section 9 of the RH Law, as afore-quoted. Once the FDA approves contraceptive drugs and devices like hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine devices, injectables and other family planning products and supplies, they will be included in the Essential Drugs List (EDL). As manifested by the Solicitor General, only drugs and medicines found in the EDL/Philippine National Drug Formulary System (PNDFS) may be dispensed, (whether for free or for a reduced amount) by public health care facilities.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> <i>These contraceptive drugs and devices, thus, become widely and easily accessible to the public.</i> In fact, the IRR devolves the distribution of these contraceptives up to the <i>barangay</i> level with the DOH as the lead agency tasked, with its procurement and distribution. Thus, an erroneous determination by the FDA has an <i>immediate</i> and <i>widespread</i> impact on the right to life of the unborn.<br><br>However, there is another even more crucial aspect in the implementation of the Rli Law which has <i>far</i> greater impact on the right to life of the unborn than the FDA's determination of what are allowable contraceptives. It is found in the <i>proviso</i> of Section 9 which states "any product or supply included or to be included in the EDL must have a certification from the FDA that said product and supply is made available on the condition that it is not to be used as an abortifacient." In other words, under this section, products and supplies (hereinafter "subject products and supplies") which are abortifacients (or have abortifacient properties) will also be included in the EDL <i>provided </i>that 'these products and. supplies will not be used as abortifacients as certified by the FDA.<br><br>I share the view of the <i>ponencia</i> that the aforesaid certification is empty and absurd. Such certification cannot guarantee that the subject products and supplies will not be used as abortifacients. The ponencia modifies the phrase from "it is not to be used" to "it cannot be used" in order to protect the right to life of the unborn.<br><br>With due respect, I am of the view that the change in wording will not alter the result. The certification is of limited value. Even with the change in wording, there will be no guarantee that the subject products and. supplies will not be used as abortifacients. I submit that the proper area that should be strictly scrutinized is the implementing rules and regulations of Section 9 relative to the purchase and distribution of the subject products and supplies.<br><br>But before going to that, I find it necessary to discuss the rationale of this <i>proviso</i> in Section 9. The Senate Journal of October 8, 2012 summarizes the discussions leading to its final version, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>On page 9, line 8 of the bill, after the word "PRACTICE" and the period (.), Senator Lacson proposed the insertion of a new sentence to read: FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS ACT, ANY FAMILY PLANNING PRODUCT OR SUPPLY INCLUDED OR TO BE INCLUDED IN THE ESSENTIAL DRUG LIST MUST HAVE A CERTIFICATION FROM THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) OF THE PHILIPPINES.THAT SAID PRODUCT AND SUPPLY HAS NO ABORTIFACIENT OR ABORTICIDE EFFECT.<br><br>Senator Cayetano (P) expressed willingness to accept the amendment, subject to style, but she explained that there are certain medications which are effectively abortifacient but are not used for such purpose. These medications, she explained, cannot be simply banned because they are necessary drugs for purposes for which they were introduced and are prescribed <b>under very strict guidelines by a medical practitioner.</b><br><br>She suggested that an amendment be made to require the issuance of a certification that such drugs should be used for their intended medical purpose and not as abortifacient.<br><br>Citing another example, Senator Cayetano (P) said that a particular drug is being prescribed to teenagers to treat the breakout of acne, provided an assurance is given that the patient is not pregnant or otherwise sexually active because it could cause severe physical abnormality to a fetus like being born without limbs. She noted that the said drug could not be banned because it has to be used for an intended purpose.<br><br>Senator Lacson expressed apprehension that a woman who has acne and wishes to have an abortion may take advantage of the essential drug being provided by the, government to avail of its abortive side effect.<br><br>Senator Cayetano (P) agreed with Senator Lacson that the said essential, medicine should not be used as abortifacients. However, she said that the medical consultants present in the gallery point out that a number of drugs with similar effect are actually available in the market and, banning these drugs could pose a great danger as they are being prescribed for a particular purpose. In addition to the literature that come with the drugs, she suggested that stronger warnings be made by health professionals that in no case shall these drugs be prescribed and made available as abortifacients.<br><br>Upon query of Senator Lacson, Senator Cayetano (P) replied that these drugs that are prescribed to teat very serious medical conditions have been available in the market for the longest time such that withdrawing them from the market would be very detrimental to llie health system in (lie country. For instance, she said that <i>Oxylocin</i> is used to induce labor in conditions necessitating that the baby be delivered right away, like in cases when llie baby's umbilical cord has encircled his/her neck. She said that<i> Oxylocin</i> is actually intended to save a baby's life: thus, it should not be given to a two-month pregnant woman. She reiterated that withdrawing an essential medicine such as <i>Oxylocin </i>from the market would totally debilitate the maternity health care system.<br><br>Asked how it could be ensured that such and similar drugs would not be used as abortifacients. Senator Cayetano (P) replied that a health professional who prescribes a drug such as <i>Oxylocin</i> to a woman who is in her first trimester of pregnancy is clearly prescribing it as an abortifacient and should therefore be held liable under the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>Asked whether the government would be providing drugs such as Oxylocin Senator Cayetano (P) said that health care providers involved in childbirth have expressed their desire to have access to such drugs because these are essential medicines that could actually improve maternal mortality rate since it could enable them to immediately save the life of a child. However, she underscored the importance of ensuring <b>that the FDA would be very strict on its use.</b><br><br>At this juncture, Senator Sotto asked Senator Lacson what his particular proposed amendment would be, Senator Lacson replied that he would like to insert a provision, subject to style, that would ensure that the drugs cannot be used as abortifacients but they can be used for the purpose for which they were introduced in (lie market. Senator Sotto suggested that the Body be presented with the actual text of the amendment before it approves it. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>As can be seen, the purpose of including the subject products and supplies in the EDL is their importance in treating certain diseases and/or their use as life-saving drugs. Yet, at the same time, these products and supplies can be used as abortifacients.<br><br>The inclusion of these products and supplies in the EDL, under Section 9 of the RH Law, will necessarily present numerous challenges. On the one hand, the State has a substantial interest in making available the subject products and supplies in order to treat various diseases and, in some instances, these products and supplies are necessary to save lives. On the other hand, by allowing the subject products and supplies to be included in the EDL, the right to life of the unborn may be jeopardized if access to these products and supplies are easily obtained by unscrupulous individuals.<br><br>The answer to (lie problem was touched on during the legislative deliberations. It lies in the strict regulation of these products and supplies. The IRR states:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 8.03</b> <i>Review of Existing Guidelines.</i> Within thirty (30) days from the effectivity of these Rules, the DOH shall review its existing guidelines for the procurement and distribution of reproductive health supplies and products including life-saving drugs, and shall issue new guidelines that are consistent with, these Rules.<br><br>xxxx<br><br><b>Section 8.08</b> <i>Logistics Management.</i> The DOH shall be responsible for the transportation, storage, and distribution of reproductive health products and. supplies to their respective destinations. Upon delivery to the local government units, the respective provincial, city, and/or municipal health officers shall assume responsibility for the supplies and shall ensure their prompt, continuous, and equitable distribution to all the applicable hospitals, health centers, or clinics within their respective areas of responsibility, taking into consideration existing storage facilities and other factors that may hinder the effective distribution/use of the said supplies.<br><br>The DOH shall designate a regional officer to oversee the supply chain management of reproductive health supplies and/or health products in his or her respective area, as assigned by the DOH. The officer shall promote speedy and efficient delivery of supplies, with the end goal of expedited distribution of quality-checked health products to the local government units. Towards this end, innovations on logistics and supply management, such as direct delivery of goods to the points of distribution, consistent with the intent and scope of these Rules shall be encouraged.<br><br><i>Provided, That </i>where practicable, the DOH or LGUs may engage civil society organizations or private sector distributors to accomplish the intent of this provision subject to the provisions of applicable rules and regulations.<br><br>Within sixty (60) days from the effectivity of these Rules, the DOH shall issue guidelines for the implementation of this provision.<br><br><b>Section. 8.09</b> <i>LGU-initiated Procurement.</i> An LGU may implement its own procurement, distribution and monitoring program consistent with these Rules and the guidelines of the DOH.</blockquote><br>Clearly, then, the primary responsibility for the regulation of the subject products and supplies lies with the DOIT. It is not certain whether the DOH has issued the rules and regulations relative to the purchase and distribution of these products and supplies. The Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) issued by this Court may have pre-empted the issuance of the subject guidelines relative to the purchase and distribution of these products and supplies.<br><br>But, again, pursuant to the expanded jurisdiction of this Court and as a penumbra of its power to issue rules for the protection and enforcement of the right to life of the unborn as well as the exceptional need to protect such life, the Court can require that, in the promulgation by the DOH of the subject rules and regulations or guidelines, certain minimum requirements of due process shall be followed.<br><br>I find that, under these premises, publication, notice and hearing should precede the issuance of the rules and regulations or guidelines which will govern the purchase and distribution of the subject products and supplies. In other words, there should be public hearings and/or consultations. The Solicitor General should be mandated to represent the unborn and the State's interest in the protection of the life of the unborn in these proceedings before the DOH. And interested parties should be allowed to intervene.<br><br>Concededly, the DOH shall issue the rules and regulations or guidelines pursuant to its quasi-legislative (not quasi-judicial) powers, however, again, mere is no obstacle to requiring that this rule-making process be subjected to a higher degree of due process, considering that the requirements of publication, notice and healing are mandated in, say, the issuance of tax regulations where the lesser right to property is involved. With far greater reason should publication, notice and hearing be mandated because the subject rules will ultimately impact the right to life of the unborn. Also, while the Court cannot order the DOH to submit the subject rules for the Court's appropriate action since it involves a quasi-legislative function, there is nothing to prevent an aggrieved party from challenging the subject rules upon its issuance, if the circumstances warrant, based on grave abuse of discretion under the Court's expanded jurisdiction.<br><br>The rules and regulations or guidelines should provide <i>sufficient detail</i> as to how die subject products and supplies will be purchased and distributed or dispensed: what these products and. supplies are, who shall be authorized to purchase them; who shall be authorized to store them; who shall be authorized to distribute or dispense them; the limits of what can be distributed or dispensed by particular individuals or entities; how the distribution or dispensation shall be strictly regulated; how accountability shall be enforced; and so forth.<br><br>Admittedly, the formulation of the proper rules and regulations or guidelines will necessarily present numerous challenges. The possible difficulties were already brought out in the afore-cited legislative deliberations.<br><br>Take the example of the girl with acne. The drug that is needed to treat the acne is an abortifacient. Several challenges will face the regulator in this regard. If the drug is given to her by prescription, nothing will prevent the girl, upon purchasing the drug, to give such drug to her pregnant friend who intends to have an abortion. One option that the regulator has is to require that the drug be personally administered by her (the girl's) physician so that there is no danger that the drug could be misused by the girl. The regulator must weigh whether protection of the life of the unborn is greater than the inconvenience imposed on the girl of having to frequent the clinic of her physician so that the drug can be personally administered to her. Here, the answer is obvious although there may be other means of regulation that can achieve the same end. Or take the example of health workers being given life-saving drugs which may also be used as abortifacients. The regulator now faces the challenge of how to make sure that the health worker does not abuse the life-saving drugs that will be placed, in his or her control and possession. This would involve, among others, strict monitoring and inventory procedures.<br><br>I do not intend to provide definite answers to the challenges that will face regulators relative to the regulation of the subject products and supplies. My goal is a modest one: to point out the difficulty and complexity of the problem of regulating these products and supplies. This provides greater reason why a higher level of due process is necessary in the proceedings which will result to the issuance of the rules and regulations or guidelines relative to the purchase and distribution or dispensation of the subject products and supplies. For very easily, given the complexity or difficulty of the problem, of regulation, the interests of the unborn may be relegated to the sidelines.<br><br>In fine, the afore-discussed minimum due process requirements are the only meaningful way to give effect to the constitutional right to life of the unborn from conception/fertilization under the premises. It, is worth repeating, as elsewhere stated, that the unborn cannot represent itself in the DOH's rule-making process which will ultimately bear upon its very right to life. Without the utmost care, transparency and proper representation of the unborn in the DOH's proceedings, which will result to the issuance of rules and regulations or guidelines on the purchase and distribution of the subject products and supplies, it is not difficult to discern how easily the right to life of the unborn may be trampled upon.<br><br>Pending the issuance and publication of these rules by the DOIT, the TRO insofar as the <i>proviso</i> in Section 9 of the RIT Law, as implemented by Section 7.03 of the IRR, relative to the subject products and supplies, which are made available on the condition that they will not be used as an abortifacient, should remain in force.<br><br><center><b><u>OTHER ISSUES</u></b></center><br>With respect to the other constitutional issues raised in this case, I state my position in what follows— concurring in some, dissenting in others— relative to the results reached by <i>ponencia</i>:<br><br><center><b><u>2 - Right to Health</u></b></center><br>The <i>ponencia</i> ruled that the RH Law adequately protects the right to health.<br><br>While I agree that the right to health is not violated, 1 wish to address here in greater detail petitioners' claims.<br><br>Article II, Section 15 in relation to Article XIII, Sections 11 to 13 of the Constitution provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 15.

Understandably, from petitioners' point of view, it would seem "irrational" for (1) a person to take contraceptives, which have known harmful side effects and, in the long term, even lead to premature death, and (2) the government to subsidize the same in order to prevent pregnancy or to properly space childbearing given that there are other safer means and methods of family planning. But the weighing of which value is superior to (lie other is a matter left to the individual's sound judgment and conscience. It is his or her choice; an axiom of liberty; an attribute of free will. Men and women are free to make choices that harm themselves, like cigarette-smoking or excessive intake of alcohol, in order to attain a value that they perceive is more important than their own health and well-being. For as long as these choices are made freely (and do not harm the unborn from conception/fertilization insofar as this case is concerned), the State cannot intervene beyond ensuring that, the choices are well-informed absent a clear and unequivocal constitutional or statutory<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> command permitting it to do so.<br><br>Under the RH Law, there is nothing to suggest that the contraceptives will be made available without properly informing the target users of their possible harmful side effects. The law itself mandates complete information-dissemination and severely penalizes deliberate misinformation. Section 19(c) of the RH Law in relation to Sections 7.07 to 7.11 of the IRR cover this concern, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 19. <i>Duties and Responsibilities</i>, -xxx<br><br>(c) The FDA shall issue strict guidelines with respect to the use of contraceptives, taking into consideration the side effects or oilier harmful effects of their use.<br><br><b>Section 7.07</b> <i>Technical Requirements for Family Planning Products. </i>Technical requirements for applications for product registration shall include a product insert or information leaflet for the consumers and health care providers.

In any event, petitioners may come before the courts, at the proper time, if, in the implementation of the law, the right to health of the users of the contraceptives are not properly protected because they are given inaccurate information on the contraceptives' possible harmful effects.<br><br><b><u>3 - Freedom of Religion <br>3.a- Establishment Clause</u></b><br><br>I agree with the <i>ponencia</i> that the RH Law does not violate the Establishment Clause for the reasons stated in the <i>ponencia.</i><br><br><b><u>3.b- Free Exercise Clause vis-a-vis<br>the Duty to Inform [Section 23(a)(l)l and<br>the Duty to Refer fSection 23(a)(3)|</u></b><br><br>I shall jointly discuss the constitutional validity of the duty to inform and duty to refer under the RH Law because they are intricately related to each other.<br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> ruled that the duty to inform and duty to refer imposed on the conscientious objector is unconstitutional for being violative of the Free Exercise of Religion Clause, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Resultantly, the Court finds <b>no compelling state interest</b> which would limit the free exercise clause of the <b>conscientious objectors</b>, however few in number.

After all, a couple who plans the timing, number and spacing of the birth of their children refers to a future event that is contingent on whether or not the mother decides to adopt or use the information, product, method or supply given to her or whether she decides to become pregnant at all. On the other hand, the burden placed upon those who object to contraceptive use is immediate and occurs the moment a patient seeks consultation on reproductive health matters.<br><br>Moreover, granting that a compelling interest exists to justify the infringement of the conscientious objector's religious freedom, the respondent have failed to demonstrate "the gravest abuses, endangering paramount interests" which could limit or override a person's fundamental right to religious freedom. Also, the respondents has not presented any government effort exerted to show that the means it seeks to achieve its legitimate state objective is the <b>least intrusive means</b>. Other than the assertion that the act of referring would only be momentary, considering that the act of referral by conscientious objector is the very action being contested as violative of religious freedom, it behooves the respondents to demonstrate that no other means can be undertaken by the State to achieve its objective without violating the rights of the conscientious objector. The health concerns of women may still be addressed by other practitioners who may perform reproductive health-related procedures with open willingness and motivation. Suffice it to say, a person who is forced to perform an act in utter reluctance deserves the protection of the Court as the last vanguard of constitutional freedoms.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The Court need not belabor the issue of whether the right to be exempt from being obligated to render reproductive health service and modern family planning methods, includes exemption from being obligated to give reproductive health .information and to render reproductive health procedures.

It does not provide any exception to the duty to inform. Thus, a conscientious objector is mandated to provide complete and correct information even if this will include information on artificial contraceptives to which he or she objects to on religious grounds. Otherwise, he or she shall suffer the penal liability under the law.<br><br>The duty to refer, on the other hand, is provided in the <i>proviso</i> of Section 23(a)(3), which is likewise quoted above. This provision penalizes a public or private health care service provider for refusing to extend quality health care services and information on account of a person's marital status, gender, age, religious convictions, personal circumstances, or nature of work. However, it respects the right of the conscientious objector by permitting him or her to refuse to perform or provide the health care services, to which he or she objects to on religious or ethical grounds <i>provided</i> that he or she immediately refers the person seeking such care and services to another health care service provider within the same facility or one which is conveniently accessible. As an exception to the exception, the conscientious objector cannot refuse to perform or provide such health care services if it involves an emergency condition or serious case under Republic Act No. 8344.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>It should be noted that the first sentence of Section 23(a)(3) of the RH Law refers to the refusal to extend quality health care services <i>and information</i>. However, the proviso in the aforesaid section, which imposes the duty to refer on the conscientious objector, is limited to referring the person to another health care service provider for purposes of availing health care services <i>only, not</i> health care services<i> and information</i>. The implication is that the conscientious objector is required to provide complete and correct information, and, in the event that the person asks for health care services that the conscientious objector objects to on religious or ethical grounds, the conscientious objector has the duty to refer the person to another health care service provider. This interpretation is in accord with the wording of Section 23(a)(l) of the RH Law, which provides no exceptions to the duty to inform.<br><br>It should be further noted, and not insignificantly, that Section 23(a)(3) of the RH Law does <i>not</i> state that the conscientious objector should refer the person to another health care service provider who <i>can</i> perform or provide the heath care services to which the conscientious objector objects to on religious or ethical grounds. Thus, a literal reading of this provision would permit the conscientious objector to refer the person to another health care service provider who is himself a conscientious objector. The IRR attempts to fill tliis ambiguity in Section 5.24(b) to (e) thereof, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 5.24</b> <i>Public Skilled Health Professional as a Conscientious Objector. </i>In order to legally refuse to deliver reproductive health care services or information as a conscientious objector, a public skilled health professional shall comply with the following requirements:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>b) Extraordinary diligence shall be exerted to refer the client seeking care to another skilled health professional or volunteer willing and capable of delivering the desired reproductive health care service within (lie same facility;<br><br>c) If within the same health facility, there is no other stalled health professional or volunteer willing' and capable of delivering the desired reproductive health care service, the conscientious objector shall refer the client to another specific health facility or provider mat is conveniently accessible in consideration of the client's travel arrangements and financial capacity;<br><br>d) Written documentation of compliance with, the preceding requirements; and<br><br>e) Other requirements as determined by the DOH.<br><br>In the event where die public skilled health professional cannot comply with all of the above requirements, he or she shall deliver the client's desired reproductive health care service or information without further delay, x x x</blockquote><br>This notwithstanding, and for purposes of the succeeding discussion on the Free Exercise of Religion Clause, the necessary premise is that the duty to refer involves referring the person to another health care service provider who will perform or provide the health care services to which the conscientious objector objects to on religious or ethical grounds. Though this is not explicitly stated in the RH Law, the law must be so reasonably construed given the policy of the law to provide universal access to modern methods of family planning.<br><br>As noted earlier, the duty to inform and the duty to refer are intricately related. The reason is that the duty to inform will normally <i>precede</i> the duty to refer. The process of availing reproductive health programs and services under the RH Law may be divided into two phases.<br><br>In the first phase, the person, who goes to a health service provider to inquire about the government's reproductive health programs and services under the RH Law, will be provided with complete and correct information thereon, including the right to informed choice and access to a full range of legal, medically-safe, non-abortifacient and effective family planning methods.<br><br>In the second phase, after receiving the information, the person would then ordinarily reach a decision on which reproductive health programs and services, if any, he or she wishes to avail. Once he or she makes a decision, he or she now asks the health service provider where and how he or she can avail of these programs or services.<br><br>From the point of view of the health care service provider, the first phase involves the transmission of information. Petitioners claim that this act of giving complete and correct information, including information on artificial contraceptives, imposes a burden on a conscientious objector, like a Catholic doctor, because he or she is required to give information on artificial contraceptives which he or she believes to be immoral or wrong.<br><br>I disagree.<br><br>Petitioners failed to convincingly show mat the act of giving complete and correct information, including those on artificial contraceptives, burdens a Catholic doctor's religious .beliefs. Note that the law merely requires the health service provider to give <i>complete </i>and <i>correct</i> information. Presumably this can even be done by simply giving the person a handout containing the list of the government's reproductive health programs and services under the RH Law. The valid secular purpose of the duty to inform is readily apparent and the State interest in ensuring complete and correct information is direct and substantial in order that the person may make an informed and free choice.<br><br>The law does not command the health service provider to endorse a particular family planning method but merely requires the presentation of complete and correct information so that the person can make an informed choice. A conscientious objector, like a Catholic doctor, is, thus, not compelled to endorse artificial contraceptives as the preferred family planning method. On its face, therefore, there appears to be no burden imposed on the conscientious objector under die duty to inform.<br><br>To my mind, to successfully claim that a conscientious objector, like a Catholic doctor, is burdened by the duty to inform, petitioners should have demonstrated that, for a Catholic doctor, the <i>mere mention</i> of artificial contraceptives (what they are and how they work) to the person is immoral under the tenets of the Catholic faith. In the case at bar, petitioners failed to carry this onus. Moreover, after providing the complete and correct information as mandated by the 'RH Law, there is nothing to prevent the conscientious objector, like a Catholic doctor, from speaking against artificial contraceptives on religious or ethical grounds because the RH Law cannot curtail freedom of speech; the Constitution is deemed written into the law.<br><br>For the foregoing reasons, I find, that petitioners failed to clearly show that the act of giving complete and. correct information on reproductive health programs and services under the RH Law burdens a conscientious objector's religious beliefs. Thus, I find that the duty to inform under Section 23(a)(l) of the RH Law is constitutional even with respect to the conscientious objector. In other words, the conscientious objector has the duty to inform under the aforesaid section.<br><br>I now turn to the duty to refer. As already mentioned, I reach an opposite result here. The central reason is that the second, phase involves a crucial distinguishing feature from the first phase. In the first phase, the person merely receives the complete and. correct information from the health service provider but, in the second case, the person now <i>decides to act on the information.</i> He or she makes a decision to avail of one or more of the government's reproductive health programs and services under the RH Law. In case the person seeks to avail of a program or service which the conscientious objector objects to on religious or ethical grounds, Section 23(a)(3) imposes on the conscientious objector the duty to refer the person to a health service provider who can perform or provide such program and service.<br><br>This is an entirely different scenario. The person has already made a decision and now seeks to accomplish, an act which the conscientious objector considers immoral or wrong on religious or ethical grounds. When the RH Law compels the conscientious objector to make such a referral, under pain of penal liability, the religious or ethical beliefs of the conscientious objector is clearly burdened because he or she is made to either (1) join in this intention or (2) aid in the accomplishment of this intention which he or she considers immoral or wrong.<br><br>To illustrate, a Catholic doctor, who objects to the use of artificial contraceptives, is compelled to refer a person who seeks such services to another health care service provider who will, in turn, perform or provide services related to artificial contraception. In such a case, the Catholic doctor is effectively commanded to either (1) join in the intention of the person to use artificial contraceptives or (2) aid in the accomplishment of this intention. From another perspective, the Catholic doctor may view the referral as an essential link in the chain of events which would lead to the availment of the person of such artificial contraceptives.<br><br>Consequently, in the above scenario, I am of the view that the religious or ethical beliefs of the conscientious objector are clearly burdened by the duty to refer, thus, calling for the application of the test enunciated in <i>Estrada v. Escritor</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> to wit:<br><br><ol><li>The sincerity and centrality of the religious belief and practice;<br><br></li><li>The State's compelling interest to override the conscientious objector's religious belief and practice; and<br><br></li><li>The means the&nbsp; State adopts in pursuing its interest is the least restrictive to the exercise of religious freedom.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></li></ol><br>Anent the first test, insofar as the Catholic health service provider is concerned <i>vis-a-vis</i> the use of artificial contraceptives, I find that petitioners have met the sincerity and centrality test. The Catholic Church's teaching on the use of artificial contraceptives as immoral, evil or sin is of time immemorial and well documented. Its sincerity and centrality to the Catholic faith cannot be seriously doubted as a papal encyclical, <i>Humanae Vitae</i>, has even been principally devoted to re-stating or expressing the Catholic Church's teaching on artificial contraceptives, to wit:<br><br><blockquote><i><b>Faithfulness to Gad's Design</b></i><br><br><b>13</b>. Men rightly observe that a conjugal act imposed on one's partner without regard to his or her condition or personal and reasonable wishes in matter, is no true act of love, and therefore offends the moral order in its particular application to the intimate relationship of husband and wife. If they further reflect, they must also recognize that an act of mutual love which impairs the capacity to transmit life which God the Creator, through specific laws, has built into it, frustrates His design which constitutes the norm of marriage, and contradicts (lie will of the Author of life. Hence to use this divine gift while depriving it even if only partially, of its meaning and purpose, is equally repugnant to the nature of man and of woman, and is consequently in opposition to the plan of God and His holy will. But to experience the gilt of married love while respecting the laws of conception is to acknowledge that one is not the master of the sources of life but rather the minister of the design established by the Creator. Just as man does not have unlimited dominion over his body in general, so also, and with more particular reason, he has no such dominion over his specifically sexual faculties, for these are concerned by their very nature with the generation of life, of which God is the source. "Human life is sacred—all men must recognize that fact," Our predecessor Pope John XXIII recalled. "From its very inception it reveals the creating hand of God." (13)<br><br><center><b>Unlawful Birth Control Methods</b></center><br><b>14</b>. Therefore We base Our words on the first principles of a human and Christian doctrine of marriage when We are obliged once more to declare mat (lie direct interruption of the generative process already begun and, above all, all direct abortion, even for therapeutic reasons, are to be absolutely excluded as lawful means of regulating the number of children. (14) Equally to be condemned, as the magisterium of the Church has affirmed on many occasions, is direct sterilization, whether of the man or of'the woman, whether permanent or temporary. (15)<br><br>Similarly excluded is any action which either before, at the moment of, or after sexual intercourse, is specifically intended to prevent procreation— whether as an end or as a means. (16)<br><br>Neither is it valid to argue, as a justification for sexual intercourse which is deliberately contraceptive, that a lesser evil is to be preferred to a greater one, or mat such intercourse would merge with procreative acts of past and future to form a single entity, and so be qualified by exactly the same moral goodness as these. Though it is true mat sometimes it is lawful to tolerate a lesser moral evil in order to avoid a greater evil or in order to promote a greater good," it is never lawful, even for the gravest reasons, to do evil that good may come of it (18)—in other words, to intend directly something which of its very nature contradicts the moral order, and which must therefore be judged unworthy of man, even though the intention is to protect or promote the welfare of an individual, of a family or of society in general. Consequently, it is a serious error to think that a whole married life of otherwise normal relations can justify sexual intercourse which is deliberately contraceptive and so intrinsically wrong.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></blockquote><br>Because petitioners have met the first test, the burden shifts to the government to meet the last two tests in order for the constitutional validity of the duty to refer to pass muster.<br><br>Anent the second test, the government failed to establish a compelling State interest to justify the duty to refer under pain of penalty. The purpose of the duty to refer is to facilitate the availment of the government's reproductive health programs and services. That is, it is logically more convenient that, after receiving complete and correct information on the government's reproductive health programs and services from a conscientious objector, the person should be readily referred to another health service provider who can perform or provide the chosen program or service to which the conscientious objector objects to on religious grounds.<br><br>The primary State interest, therefore, that the duty to refer serves is the facility of availing such programs and services or, in short, the person's convenience. Put another way, if there were no duty to refer and, thus, the conscientious objector is allowed to say to the person, "Sorry, I do not know of and/or cannot refer you to such a health service provider because I would be helping you to accomplish something that I consider immoral or wrong," then, at most, the person suffers the inconvenience of having to look for the proper health service provider, on his or her own, who can provide or perform the chosen program or service. Plainly, 'the person's convenience cannot override the conscientious objector's religious freedom; a right founded on respect for the inviolability of the human conscience.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Anent the third test, which is intimately related to the second test, there are clearly other means to achieve the purpose of the duty to refer. Upon the implementation of the RH Law, through Sections 5.22,48 5.23,49 and 5.24<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> of the IRR, the government will already be able to identify both conscientious objectors and non-conscientious objectors. It can, therefore, map out an effective strategy to inform all potential patients or target beneficiaries where they can avail of the <i>complete</i> reproductive health programs and services under the RH Law (which refer simply to the identity and location of all non-conscientious objector health service providers). This is well-within the State's administrative and logistical capability given its enormous machinery and the mandate of Section 20 of the RH Law, which provides that:<br><br><blockquote>"SEC. 20. Public Awareness. - The |)OH and the LGUs shall initiate and sustain a heightened nationwide miltimedia-carnpaign to raise the level of public awareness on the protection and promotion of reproductive health and rights including, but not limited to, maternal health and nutrition, family planning and responsible parenthood information and services, adolescent and youth reproductive health, guidance and counseling and other elements of reproductive health care 'under Section 4(q).<br><br>Education and information materials to be developed and disseminated to ensure their effectiveness and for this purpose shall be reviewed regularly relevance."</blockquote><br>The information, then, as to which I health service provider is not a conscientious objector can easily be disseminated through the information campaign of the government without having to burden the conscientious objector with the duty to refer.<br><br>Based on the foregoing, the duty to refer fails to meet the criteria set in <i>Estrada v. Escrilor</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Thus, it is unconstitutional.<br><br>Before closing the discussion on the duty to inform and the duty to refer, I wish to highlight the preferred status that religious freedom occupies in the hierarchy of constitutional rights by way of analogy. Let us assume that the State promulgates a law which subsidizes the purchase of weapons due to rising criminality. The law requires store owners, in the business of selling such weapons, to fully inform their buyers of the available weapons subsidized by the government. A store owner is, thus, required to inform a buyer that the following are the government subsidized, weapons: knives and guns. The store owner would have no problem acceding to this duty to inform. But suppose, one day, a buyer comes to Ms store and says that he wants to buy a gun in order to kill or murder his neighbor. The store owner, assuming he acts in accordance with his conscience, would ordinarily refuse to sell the gun. If the law, however, requires the store owner to refer the buyer to another store where the buyer can avail of this gun, despite the latter's motive for buying the gun, would this not impose a burden on the conscience of the store owner?<br><br>To a non-believer, the matter of the duty to refer relative to, say, artificial contraceptives may seem too inconsequential to merit constitutional protection. But the Court cannot judge the truth or falsity of a religious belief nor the seriousness of the consequences that its violation brings upon the conscience of the believer. For to the believer, referring a person to a health service provider where the latter can avail of artificial contraceptives may be of the same or similar level as referring a person to a store owner where he can purchase a gun to kill or murder his neighbor. It constitutes a breach of his or her covenant relationship with his or her God, and, thus, affects his or her eternal destiny. That, precisely, is the province of the Free Exercise of Religion Clause. That the believer may not have to choose between his or her earthly freedom (imprisonment) and his or her eternal destination.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, I find that the duty to refer imposed on the conscientious objector under Sections 7 and 23(a)(3) of the RH Law is unconstitutional for violating the Free Exercise of Religion Clause. Consequently, the phrase, <i>"Provided, farther, That these hospitals shall immediately refer the person seeldng such care and services to another health facility which is conveniently accessible,"</i> in Section 7 and the phrase, <i>"however, the conscientious objector shall immediately refer the person seeking such care and services to another health care service provider within the same facility or one which is conveniently accessible"</i> in Section 23(a)(3) of the RH Law should be declared void. Consequently, Sections 5.24(b) to (e) and 5.25 of the IRR, which implements me aforesaid provisions of the RH Law, are void.<br><br>In another vein, I agree with the <i>ponencia</i> that the last paragraph of Section 5.24 of the IRR is <i>ultra vires</i> because it effectively amends Section 4(n) in relation to Section 23(a)(3) of the RH Law.<br><br>Under Section 4(n) of the RH Law, a public health care service provider is defined as follows:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 4. <i>Definition of Terms.</i> - For the purpose of this Act, the following terms shall be defined as follows:<br><br>(n) <i>Public health care service provider</i> refers to: (1) public health care institution, which is duly licensed and accredited and devoted primarily to the maintenance and operation of facilities for health promotion, disease prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care of individuals suffering from illness, disease, injury, disability or deformity, or in need of obstetrical or other medical and nursing care; (2) public health care professional, who is a doctor of medicine, a nurse or a midwife; (3) public health worker engaged in the delivery of health care services; or (4) barangay health worker who has undergone training programs under any accredited government and NGO and who voluntarily renders primarily health care services in the community after having been accredited to function as such by the local health board in accordance with the guidelines promulgated by the Department of Health (DOH).</blockquote><br>While last paragraph of Section 5.24 of the IRR states:<br><br><blockquote><i>Provided, That</i> skilled health professionals such as provincial, city, or municipal health officer's, chiefs of hospital, head nurses, supervising midwives, among others, who by virtue of their office are specifically charged with the duty to implement the provisions of die RPRH Act and these Rules, <b>cannot be considered as conscientious objectors</b>.

Under Section 23(a)(3) of the RH Law, <i>both,</i> public and private health service providers may invoke the right of a conscientious objector. The last paragraph of Section 5.24 of the IRR is, thus, void insofar as it deprives the skilled health professionals enumerated therein, from the right to conscientious objection.<br><br>I also agree with the <i>ponencia</i> mat the last paragraph of Section 5.24 of the IRR is unconstitutional for being violative of the Equal Protection Clause although I find that the proper standard of review is the strict scrutiny test.<br><br>The IRR effectively creates two classes with differential treatment with respect to the capacity to invoke the right of a conscientious objector: (1) skilled health professionals such as provincial, city, or municipal health officers, chiefs of hospital, head nurses, supervising midwives, among others, who by virtue of their office are specifically charged with the duty to implement the provisions of the RH Law and its IRR, and (2) skilled health professionals not belonging to (1). Those belonging to the first class cannot invoke the right of a conscientious objector while those in the second class are granted that right.<br><br>In our jurisdiction, equal protection analysis has generally followed the rational basis test coupled with a deferential attitude to legislative classifications and a reluctance to invalidate a law absent a clear and unequivocal showing of a breach, of the Constitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> However, when the classification burdens a suspect class or impinges on fundamental rights, the proper standard of review is the strict scrutiny test.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Under the strict scrutiny test, the government must show a compelling or overriding end to justify either: (1) the limitation on fundamental rights or (2) the implication of suspect classes.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> The classification will only be upheld if it is shown to be suitably tailored to serve a compelling State interest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Suspect classes include classifications based on race, nationality, alienage or denominational preference while classifications impinging on fundamental rights include those affecting marriage, procreation, voting, speech and interstate travel.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>Here, the classification impinges on the fundamental right of free exercise of religion, as operationalized through the right of a conscientious objector, which the RH Law recognizes and respects. The government must, therefore, show that the differential treatment between .the first class and second class of skilled health professionals serves a compelling State interest.<br><br>I find that the State has failed to prove how curtailing the right of conscientious objection of those belonging to the first class will further a compelling State interest. One perceptible reason for depriving the right of conscientious objection to those belonging to the first class appears to be the fear that this will paralyze or substantially degrade the effective implementation of the RH Law considering that these skilled health professionals are employed in public health institutions and local government units.<br><br>This fear rests on at least two assumptions: (1) most, if not all, skilled health professionals belonging to the first class are conscientious objectors, and (2) the State is incapable of securing the services of an adequate number of skilled health professionals who are not conscientious objectors. Both assumptions have not been proven by the State. And, even if it were so proven, it must be recalled that the right of the conscientious objector is a limited one: he or she may refuse to perform or provide reproductive health services to which he or she objects to on religious grounds. In such a case, the solution is for the person to avail of such services elsewhere. Consequently, the State would now have to show that the inconvenience caused on the part of the person, who must secure such services elsewhere (which could be as near as the doctor in the next room or as far-flung as the doctor in another province or region) overrides the freedom of religion of conscientious objectors belonging to the first class. As earlier noted, it is self-evident that the person's convenience cannot override the freedom of religion of the conscientious objector; a constitutionally protected right predicated on respect for the inviolability of the human conscience. (Even if this inconvenience would entail, for example, added transportation costs, it cannot be seriously argued that one can place a monetary value on the inviolability of the human conscience.)<br><br>Hence, I find that the last paragraph of Section 5.24 of the IRR is unconstitutional on equal protection grounds.<br><br><center><b><u>3.c- Family Planning Seminars</u></b></center><br>I agree with the <i>ponencia</i>. that Section 15 of the RH Law mandating a family planning seminar as a condition for the issuance of a marriage license is constitutional for reasons stated in the <i>ponencia.</i><br><br><b><center>4- The Family Planning And The Right To Privacy <br>4.a.

According to the <i>ponencia</i>, the decision-making process on reproductive health procedures must involve both spouses, that is, the decision belongs exclusively to both spouses, in consonance with the right of the spouses to found a family. Otherwise, this will destroy family unity. Further, this process involves a private matter that the State cannot intrude into without violating the constitutional right to marital privacy. The spouses must, thus, be left alone to chart their own destiny.<br><br>Section 23(a)(2)(i) of the RH Law provides that:<br><br><blockquote>"SEC. 23. <i>Prohibited Acts</i>. - The following acts are prohibited:<br><br>(a) Any health care service provider, whether public or private, who shall;<br><br>xxxx<br><br>(2) Refuse to perform legal and medically-safe reproductive health procedures on any person of legal, age on the ground of lack of consent or authorization of the following persons in the following instances:<br><br>(i) Spousal consent in case of married persons: Provided, That in case of disagreement, <b>the decision of the one undergoing the procedure shall prevail</b>; x x x (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>This provision contemplates a situation where the spouses are unable to agree if one of them should undergo a reproductive health procedure like tubal ligation or vasectomy. It does not dispense with consulting the other spouse but provides a mechanism to settle the disagreement, if one should arise.<br><br>Indeed, the decision-making process in this area is a delicate and private matter intimately related to the founding of a family. The matter should, thus, be decided by both spouses under the assumption that they will amicably settle their differences and forthwith act in the best interest of the marriage and family. But, as in all relations between and among individuals, irreconcilable disagreements may arise. The law, therefore, steps in to break the <i>impasse.</i><br><br>The law, however, settles the dispute by giving the spouse, who will undergo the procedure, the absolute and final authority to decide the matter. The rationale seems to be that the spouse, who will undergo the procedure, should ultimately make the decision since it involves his or her body.<br><br>Like the <i>ponencia</i>, I am of the view that this provision in the RH Law clearly violates Article II, Section 12 in relation to Article XV, Sections 1 and 3(1) of the Constitution, which are quoted hereunder:<br><br><blockquote>Section 12. The State recognizes the sanctity of family life and shall protect and strengthen the family as a basic autonomous social institution, x x x<br><br>xxxx<br><br>Section 1.

The State shall defend:<br><br>(1) The right of spouses to found a family in accordance with their religious convictions and the demands of responsible parenthood; x x x</blockquote><br>Taken together, these constitutional provisions are intended to, among others, prohibit the State from adopting measures which impair the solidarity of the Filipino family.57 In particular, Section 3(1) explicitly guarantees the right of the spouses to found a family in accordance with their religious convictions and the demands of responsible parenthood. This necessarily refers to, among others, the number of children that the spouses will bring into this world.<br><br>The provision speaks of this right as properly belonging to <i>both</i> spouses. The right is, thus, conferred on both of them and they are to exercise this right jointly. Implicit in this provision is mat the spouses <i>equally</i> possess this right particularly when read in light of Article II, Section 1458 of the Constitution which enjoins the State to ensure the fundamental equality before the law of women and men.<br><br>Thus, the spouse, who will undergo the reproductive health procedure, cannot be given the absolute and final authority to decide this matter because it will destroy the solidarity of the family, in general, and do violence to the equal right of each spouse to found the family in accordance with their religious convictions and the demands of responsible parenthood, in particular.<br><br>My disagreement with the ruling of the <i>ponencia</i>, however, is that it falls on the other extreme. When the <i>ponencia</i> states that the aforesaid decision-making process must be settled through the spouses' mutual consent and that the State cannot intrude in such, process because of the right to marital privacy, the implicit result is that the other spouse, who refuses to give his or her consent, is given the absolute and final authority to decide this matter. In other words, the result reached by the, ponencia is merely the opposite of that under the RH Law. That is, the non-consenting spouse is effectively given the absolute and final authority in the decision-making process.<br><br>I find this result equally repugnant to the afore-discussed constitutional provisions.<br><br>To my mind, the State can intervene in marital rights and obligations when there are genuine and serious disagreements between the spouses. This is a basic postulate of our Constitution relative to marriage and family relations as well as our existing family laws and rules of procedure. The constitutional right to privacy does not apply in this situation because the conflict of rights and obligations is between one spouse and the other, and does not involve a dispute between the State and the spouses,<br><br>This view is consistent with the provisions of the Family Code on dispute resolution between spouses which preserves and adheres to the constitutional precept on the solidarity of the family and the right, belonging to both spouses, to found the family. State intervention, which provides the solution to the problem, involves calling upon the courts to ultimately settle the dispute in case of disagreement between the spouses. To illustrate, the Family Code explicitly provides how disagreements shall be settled in various marital and family relations' controversies, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>ARTICLE 69. The husband and wife shall fix the family domicile.<b> In case of disagreement, the court shall decide.</b><br><br>The court may exempt one spouse from living with the other if the latter should live abroad or there are other valid and compelling reasons for the exemption. However, such exemption shall not apply if the same is not compatible with the solidarity of the family.<br><br>xxxx<br><br>ARTICLE 73.

The principle of "in case of disagreement, the court will decide" properly governs how conflicts involving marital rights and obligations shall be resolved, without giving to one spouse the absolute and final authority to resolve the conflict, and, thus, preserving the equal, right of the spouses to found the family and maintaining the solidarity of the family in consonance with the Constitution.<br><br>Of course, unlike most of the above-quoted Family Code provisions, neither the husband nor wife's decision in this particular situation can, in the meantime, prevail considering that the effects of the reproductive healtli procedures may be permanent or irreversible. Thus, the decision-making process on undergoing reproductive health procedures by one spouse requires the consent of both spouses but, in case of disagreement, the courts will decide.<br><br>The key principle is that no spouse has the absolute and final authority to decide this matter because it will run counter to the constitutional edict protecting the solidarity of the family and equally conferring the right to found the family on both spouses. Consequently, while I agree that Section 23(a)(2)(i) of the RH Law is unconstitutional, the declaration of unconstitutionality should not be construed as giving the non-consenting spouse the absolute and final authority in the decision-making process relative to undergoing a reproductive health procedure by one spouse. The proper state of the law and rules of procedure on the matter is that the decision shall require the consent of both spouses, and, in case of disagreement, the matter shall be brought before the courts for its just adjudication.<br><br><b><center><u>4.b. - The need of parental consent</u></center></b><br>I agree with the <i>ponencia</i> that the phrase, "except when the minor is already a parent or has had a miscarriage," in Section 7 of the RH Law is unconstitutional but for different reasons. This provision states, in part, that:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 7. <i>Access to Family Planning.</i> - x x x<br><br>No person shall be denied information find access to family planning services, whether natural or artificial: Provided, That minors will not be allowed access to modern methods of family planning without written consent from their parents or guardian/s <b>except when the minor is already a parent or has had a miscarriage</b>.

The State recognizes the sanctity of family life and shall protect and strengthen the family as a basic autonomous social institution, x x x</blockquote><br>The description of the family as a "basic" social institution is "an assertion that the family is anterior to the state and is not a creature of the state"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> while the reference to the family as "autonomous" is "meant to protect the family against the instrumentalization by the state." This provision is, thus, a guarantee against unwarranted State intrusion on matters dealing with family life.<br><br>The subject of parental authority and responsibility is specifically dealt with in the last sentence of the above constitutional provision which reads:<br><br><blockquote>The natural and primary right and duty of parents in the rearing of the youth for civic efficiency and the development of moral character shall receive the support of the Government.</blockquote><br>As a natural right, parental, authority is recognized as an inherent right, not created by the State or decisions of the courts, but derives from the nature of the parental relationship.&nbsp; More important, as pertinent in this controversy, the present Constitution refers to such right as "primary" which "imports the assertion that the right of parents is superior to that of the state."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>Title IX of the Family Code is the principal governing law on parental authority. Chapter 3, Section 220 thereof provides:<br><br><blockquote>Chapters.

Further, the deprivation or loss of parental: authority, which is governed by the judicial process, crises only in exceptional cases when the best interest of the minor so requires. There is, therefore, an inherent public policy recognizing the necessity of keeping parental authority intact and shielding it from undue State intrusion or interference.<br><br>Viewed in this light, Section 7 of the RH Law is a radical departure from, the afore-discussed public policy as embodied in our Constitution and family laws. The decision on access to modern methods of family planning by minors evidently falls within the ambit of parental authority, in general, and Article 220 of the Family Code, in particular, which recognizes the parents' right and duty to provide advice and counsel, moral and spiritual guidance, as well as to protect, preserve and maintain the minor's physical and mental health. It cannot be doubted that the use of modern methods of family planning by a minor will greatly impact his or her physical, mental, moral, social and spiritual life. And yet Section 7 would, exempt such a decision by a minor, who is already a parent or has had a miscarriage, from parental authority by allowing access to modern methods of family planning without parental consent.<br><br>I find that this <i>proviso</i> in the RH Law is unconstitutional in view of the nature and scope of parental authority.<br><br>Because parental authority is a constitutionally recognized natural and primary right of the parents, with emphasis on "primary" as giving parents a superior right over the State, the State cannot carve out an exception to such authority without showing or providing a sufficiently compelling State interest to do so. A limited but blanket exception from parental authority, such as that found in Section 7 of the RH Law, will undoubtedly destroy the solidarity of the family as well as foster disrespect and disobedience on the part of the minor. It disrupts the natural state of parent-child relationship and is wholly inconsistent with the purpose and essence of parental authority granting the parents the natural and primary right in <i>all </i>matters relating to the rearing and care of the minor in, order to safeguard Ms or her well-being.<br><br>In the case at bar, the State failed to prove such sufficiently compelling State interest. The rationale of Section 7 seems to be mat a minor, who is already a parent or has had a miscarriage, by reason of such fact alone, <i>automatically </i>and<i> definitively </i>attains a level of maturity that demands that he or she no longer be placed under the parental authority of his or her parents relative to decisions involving access to modern methods of family planning. However, there is no basis to reach this conclusion. The State has provided none. And the opposite is probably more true; in that the early parenthood or miscarriage of the minor is a sign of immaturity which, therefore, necessitates <i>greater </i>parental guidance, supervision and support for the minor, including decisions relative to access to modern methods of family planning. This is especially true in the case of the minor who faces the early prospect of raising a child or children.<br><br>Further, if the purpose of Section 7 of the RH Law is to uphold the interest of the minor, who is already a parent or has had a miscarriage, from Ms or her parents who unjustifiably withholds consent for him or her to have access to modern methods of family planning, there are less intrusive means to achieve tMs purpose considering that a judicial remedy, where the courts can look into the particular circumstances of a case and decide thereon based on the best interest of the minor, may be availed of by the minor.<br><br>The State has, therefore, not only failed to prove a sufficiently compelling State interest to carve out an exception to the constitutionally recognized parental authority of parents but also failed to prove that the apparent goal of this provision cannot be attained by less intrusive means. Hence, Section 7 of the RH Law, particularly the phrase, "except when the minor is already a parent or has had a miscarriage," is unconstitutional for violating the natural and primary right of parents in rearing their minor children as recognized under Article II, Section 12 of the Constitution.<br><br>Additionally, the distinction based on the predicament of the minor, as already being a parent or has had a miscarriage, vis-a-vis the requirement of parental consent on matters relating to access to modern methods of family planning is unconstitutional on equal protection grounds. A parallel standard of review leads to the same end result.<br><br>The <i>proviso</i> in Section 7 of the RH Law effectively creates two groups with varying treatments: (1) minors who are already parents or have had a miscarriage, and (2) minors who are not parents or have not had a miscarriage. The first group is exempt from parental consent while the second is not.<br><br>For convenience, I reproduce below the baseline principles on equal protection analysis which I utilized in a previous section:<br><br><blockquote>In our jurisdiction, equal protection analysis has generally followed the rational basis test coupled with a deferential attitude to legislative classifications and a reluctance to invalidate a law absent a clear and unequivocal showing of a breach of the Constitution. However, when the classification burdens a suspect: class or impinges on fundamental rights, the proper standard of review is the strict scrutiny test.<br><br>Under the strict scrutiny test, the government must show a compelling or overriding end to justify (1) the limitation on fundamental rights or (2) the implication of suspect classes. The classification will only be upheld if it is shown to be suitably tailored to serve a compelling State interest. Suspect classes include classifications based on race or nationality while classifications impinging on fundamental rights include those affecting marriage, procreation, voting, speech and interstate travel.</blockquote><br>As stated earlier, the fundamental right involving the parental authority of pcirents over their minor children is unduly limited by the<i> proviso</i> in Section 7 of the RH Law, thus, calling for the application of the strict scrutiny test. The government must show mat a compelling State interest justifies the curtailment of parental authority of parents whose minor children, belong to the first group (<i>i.e</i>., minors who are already parents or have had a miscarriage) vis-a-vis parents whose minor children belong to the second group (<i>i.e.</i>, minors who are not parents or have not had a miscarriage). However, for reasons already discussed as to the maturity level of such group of minors and the apparent purpose of the subject legal provision, the government has failed to show such compelling State interest. Hence, the phrase "except when the minor is already a parent or has had a miscarriage" in Section 7 of the RH Law is, likewise, unconstitutional on equal protection grounds.<br><br><center><b><u>4.c- Access to information</u></b></center><br>I agree with the <i>ponencia</i> that there is nothing unconstitutional about the capacity of a minor to access information, on family planning services under Section 7 of the RH Law for the reasons stated in the <i>ponencia</i>. hi addition, for practical reasons, the State or parents of the minor cannot prevent or restrict access to such information considering that they will be readily available on various platforms of media, if they are not already available at present It is only when the minor decides to act on the information by seeking access to the family planning services themselves that parental authority cannot be dispensed with (as discussed in a previous section).<br><br><b><u>5- Age-And Pevelopment-Appropritate<br>Reproductive Health Education</u></b><br><br>I agree with the <i>ponencia</i> that the constitutional challenge against Section 14<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> of the RH Law is unavailing insofar as it is claimed to violate Article II, Section 12 of the Constitution on the natural and primary right and duty of parents to rear their children. Indeed, the State has a substantial interest in the education of the youth. Pursuant to its police power, the State may regulate the content of the matters taught to adolescents particularly with respect to reproductive health. education in order to, among others, propagate proper attitudes and behavior relative to human sexuality and sexual relations as well as properly prepare the young for marriage and family life.&nbsp; The topics to be covered by the curriculum include values formation; knowledge and skills in self-protection against discrimination; sexual abuse and violence against women and children and other forms of gender based violence and teen pregnancy; physical, social and emotional changes in adolescents; women's rights and&nbsp; children's rights; responsible teenage behavior; gender and development; and responsible. parenthood. The curriculum is, thus, intended to achieve valid secular objectives. As the <i>ponencia</i> aptly noted, the RH Law seeks to supplement, not supplant, the natural and primary right and duty of parents to rear their children.<br><br>Further, the constitutional challenge against Section 14 relative to the Free Exercise of Religion Clause is premature because, as noted by the<i> ponencia</i>, the Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS) has yet to formulate the curriculum on age- and development-appropriate reproductive health education. A Free Exercise of Religion Clause challenge would necessarily require the challenger to state what specific religious belief of his or hers is burdened by the subject curriculum as well as the specific content of the curriculum he or she objects to on religious grounds. Moreover, the proper party to mount such a challenge would be the student and/or his or her parents upon learning of the specific content of the curriculum and upon deciding what aspects of their religious beliefs are burdened. It would be inappropriate for the Court to speculate on these aspects of a potential Free Exercise of Religion Clause litigation involving a curriculum that has yet to be formulated by the DECS.<br><br>As to the equal protection challenge against Section 14, I agree with the<i> ponencia</i> that there are substantial distinctions between public and private educational institutions which justify the optional teaching of reproductive health education in private educational institutions. (By giving private educational institutions the option to adopt the curriculum to be formulated by the DECS, the RH Law effectively makes the teaching of reproductive health education in private educational institutions optional because the aforesaid institutions may completely discard such curriculum).<br><br>However, I disagree that the academic freedom of private educational institutions should be a basis of such justification. Article XTV, Section 5(2) of the Constitution provides mat, "[a]cademic freedom shall be enjoyed in all institutions of higher learning." Thus, only institutions of higher learning enjoy academic freedom. Considering that the students who will be subjected to reproductive health education are adolescents or "young people between the ages often (10) to nineteen (19) years who are in transition from childhood to adulthood,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> men this would presumably be taught in elementary and high schools which are not covered by academic freedom.<br><br>Nonetheless, I agree with the <i>ponencia </i>that, by effectively decreeing optional teaching of reproductive health education in private educational institutions, the RH Law seeks to respect the religious belief system of the aforesaid institutions. I find this to be a reasonable basis for the differential treatment between public and private educational institutions.<br><br>As previously discussed, the general approach in resolving equal protection challenges in our- jurisdiction is to utilize the rational basis test. Here, the classification between public and private educational institutions neither contains a suspect classification nor impinges on a fundamental right, thus, the rational basis test is <i>apropos</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> In <i>British American Tobacco v. Sec. Camacho,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> we explained that -<br><br><blockquote>Under this test, a legislative classification, to survive an equal protection challenge, must be shown to rationally further a legitimate state interest. The classifications must be reasonable and rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation. Since every law has in its favor the presumption of constitutionality, the burden of proof is on the one attacking the constitutionality of the law to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the legislative classification is without rational basis. The presumption of constitutionality can be overcome only by the most explicit demonstration that a classification is a hostile and oppressive discrimination against particular persons and classes, and that there.is no conceivable basis which might support it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup></blockquote><br>Noticeably, the RH Law is replete with provisions respecting the religious freedoms of individuals. In fact, one of its central and guiding principles is free and informed choice, thus, negating the imposition of any family planning method on an individual who objects on religious grounds. The same principle appears to have been carried over relative to the teaching of reproductive health education in private educational institutions. Congress may have legitimately concluded that the State interests in societal peace, tolerance or benevolent-neutrality accommodation, as the case may be, vis-a-vis the various religious belief systems of private educational institutions in our nation will be better served by making the teaching of reproductive health education (which may touch on or impact delicate or sensitive religious beliefs) as merely optional in such institutions. We can take judicial notice of the fact that majority of the private educational institutions in our nation were established and are run by religious groups or sects.<br><br>The classification in Section 14 of the RH Law, thus, rests on substantial distinctions and rationally furthers a legitimate State interest. It seeks to further no less than the constitutional principle on the separation of State and Church as well as the Free Exercise of Religion Clause. In fine, it is not for this Court to look into the wisdom of this legislative classification but only to determine its rational basis. For the foregoing reasons, I find that the differential treatment between public and private educational institutions in the law passes the rational basis test and is, thus, constitutional insofar as the equal protection challenge is concerned.<br><br><center><b>6- Due Process and Free Speech Clause</b></center><br>I agree with the <i>ponencia</i> that the void for vagueness doctrine is inapplicable to the challenged portions of the RH Law for reasons stated in the <i>ponencia.</i><br><br>However, I find it necessary to discuss in greater detail why the void for vagueness doctrine is not applicable particularly with respect to the duty to inform under Section 23 (a)(l) of the RH Law. The reason is that the void for vagueness challenge is inextricably related to freedom of speech which, under the exceptional circumstances of this case, once again requires the Court to take steps to protect this constitutional right pursuant to its expanded jurisdiction and as a penumbra to its power to issue rules for the protection and enforcement of constitutional rights.<br><br>As previously discussed, Section 23(a)(l) of the Mi Law imposes a duty to inform on both public and private health care service providers:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 23. <i>Prohibited Ads</i>. -The following acts are prohibited:<br><br>(a) Any health care service provider, whether public or private, who shall:<br><br>(1) Knowingly withhold information or restrict the dissemination thereof, and/or intentionally provide incorrect information regarding programs and services on reproductive health including the right to informed choice and access to a full range of legal, medically-safe, non-abortifacient and effective family planning methods;</blockquote><br>In effect, the law requires that <i>complete</i> and <i>correct </i>information on the government's reproductive health programs and services, including the right to informed choice and access to a full range of legal, medically-safe, non-abortifacient and effective family planning methods, be given to all persons who are qualified beneficiaries under the RH Law. The law and its IRR, however, does not define the nature and extent of "complete and correct information." Petitioners claim that, without this definition, the duty to inform should be nullified under the void for vagueness doctrine.<br><br>I disagree.<br><br>The RH Law enjoys the presumption of constitutionality and should be given a construction which will avoid its nullity. The phrase "[k]nowingly withhold information or restrict the dissemination thereof, and/or intentionally provide incorrect information regarding programs and services" under Section 23(a)(l) of the RH Law should be reasonably and narrowly construed as merely requiring the health care service provider to provide and explain to persons the list of the government's reproductive health programs and services under the RH Law. To illustrate, if the government's reproductive health programs and services under the RH Law consists of A, B, C and D, then a health care service provider is required to transmit this information to a person qualified to avail of the benefits under the law.<br><br>But it is not as simple as that<br><br>The RH Law itself provides that the individual should be allowed to make a free and informed choice. As a result, the government has set a self-limiting policy that it will not endorse any particular family planning method. Yet, invariably, potential beneficiaries of these programs and services will seek the advice or counsel of health care service providers as to which programs and services they should avail of.<br><br>When this occurs, can the government control the opinions that health care service providers will give the potential beneficiaries by limiting the content of such opinions? That is, can the government prevent health care service providers from giving their opinions or controlling the content of their opinions, in favor or against, a particular reproductive health service or program by mandating that only a particular opinion will comply with the "complete and correct information" standard under Section 23 (a)(1) of the RH Law?<br><br>I submit that the government cannot do so without violating the Free Speech Clause.<br><br>The "complete and correct information" standard cannot be construed as covering matters regarding the professional opinions (including the opinions of a conscientious objector on religious or ethical grounds as previously discussed) of health service providers, either for, or against, these programs and services because this would constitute an abridgement of freedom of speech through subsequent punishment. The government cannot curtail such opinions without showing a clear and present danger that will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> In the case at bar, there is no attempt on the part of the government to satisfy the clear and present danger test. Consequently, the "complete and correct information" standard under Section 23(a)(l) should be narrowly construed in order not to violate the Free Speech Clause. As earlier noted, the only way to save it from constitutional infirmity is to construe the "complete and correct information" standard as referring to information containing the <i>list</i> of the government's reproductive health programs and services under the RH Law. Anything beyond that would transgress the free speech guarantee of the Constitution.<br><br>Indubitably, an expansive and broad interpretation of the "complete and correct information" standard will give the government the unbridled capacity to censor speech by only allowing opinions on the reproductive health programs and services under the RH Law which, it favors. The government can use the "complete and correct information" standard to force health care service providers to endorse the former's preferred family planning method despite the clear policy of the RH Law granting free and informed choice to the individual. This cannot be done without violating the Free Speech Clause.<br><br>Of course, this would mean that health care service providers, who are for or against certain programs and services under the RH Law, will be able to influence potential beneficiaries over which family planning method or means to avail of. This is the price of living in a democratic polity, under our constitutional order, where opinions are freely expressed and exchanged. The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and, thus, tilts the balance in favor of the individual's right to free speech unless the State can show that controlling the individual's speech can pass the clear and present danger test. Here, as afore-stated, the government has failed to satisfy this test. If the government desires to push a preferred family planning method, it has the full machinery of the State to back up its information campaign under Section 20 of the RH Law. However, it cannot force individual health care service providers, under pain of penal liability, to express opinions that are favorable to certain reproductive health programs and services under the RH Law. Government may try to convince health care service providers, but not force them.<br><br>The above disquisition should not, of course, be taken to mean that health care service providers shall be exempt from their professional or ethical responsibilities which they owe to their patients and which may result to administrative, civil or criminal liabilities of the former based on their code of ethical conduct not unlike the code of ethics for lawyers. But, unavoidably, the professional opinion or advice of health care service providers will be sought by potential beneficiaries under the RH Law and, in that instance, the "complete and correct information" standard cannot be utilized by the State to curtail the health care service provider's freedom of speech.<br><br>Thus, I find that the "complete and correct information" standard under Section 23(a)(l) of the RH Law and, hence, the duty to inform (as discussed in a previous subsection) is constitutional <i>only insofar</i> as it requires health care service providers to provide a<i> list </i>of the government's reproductive health programs and services under the RH Law to qualified beneficiaries. Further, given the afore-discussed peculiar circumstances of this case and in order to adequately protect the right to free speech of health care service providers, it is necessary for the Court to issue an order directing the DOIT to generate the complete and correct list of the government's reproductive health programs and services under the RH Law<i> which will serve as the template for the "complete and correct information" standard and, hence, the duty to inform under Section 23 (a) (1) of the RH Law.</i> The DOIT should be directed to distribute this template to all health care service providers covered by the RH Law. This will forestall any confusion on the nature and scope of the "complete and correct information" standard which is necessary given the penal clause under the duty to inform.<br><br><center><b><u>7- Equal Protection</u></b></center><br>I agree with the <i>ponencia</i> that the RH Law does not violate the equal protection clause insofar as it is claimed to single out the poor to reduce their numbers and that the poor may be the subject of government subsidy for the programs under the RH Law for reasons stated in <i>ponencia</i>.<br><br><center><b><u>8. Section 7 (Involuntary Servitude)&nbsp; </u></b></center><br>I am fully in accord with the ruling of the ponencia that Section 17 of the RH Law does not violate the constitutional prohibition against involuntary servitude and that it is unconstitutional insofar as it imposes a duty to conscientious objectors to render pro bono reproductive health care services to which the conscientious objector objects to on religious or ethical grounds for reasons stated in the ponencia. Corrorarily, the conscientious objector can be required to render pro bono reproductive health care services for as long as it involves services that he or she does not object to on religious or ethical grounds.<br><br><center><b><u>9. Delegation of Authority To The FDA</u></b></center><br>I am fully in accord with, the ruling of the <i>ponencia</i> that Congress can validly delegate to the FDA the authority or power to determine whether the drugs, devices, methods or services to be used under the RH Law comply with constitutional and statutory standards for reasons stated in the <i>ponencia.</i><br><br><b><u>10. Autonomy Of The Local. Government Units (LGUs) <br>And The Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM)</u></b><br><br>I concur with the <i>ponencia</i> that the RH Law does not violate the local autonomy of LGUs and the AJRMM guaranteed under Article II, Section 25<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> and Article X, Section 2<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> of the Constitution.<br><br>I have reservations, however, with regard to the following statements in the<i> ponencia</i>:<br><br><blockquote>In this case, a reading of the RH Law clearly shows that whether it pertains to the establishment of health care facilities, the hiring of skilled health professionals, or the training of barangay health workers, it would be the <b>national government</b> that would provide for the funding of its implementation. Local autonomy is not absolute. The national government still has the say when it comes to national priority programs which the local government is called upon to implement like the RH Law.<br><br>Moreover, from the use of the word "endeavour", the local government units are merely encouraged to provide these services. There is nothing in the wording of the law which can be construed as making the availability of these services mandatory for the local government units. For said reason, it cannot be said that the RH Law amounts to an undue encroachment by the national government upon the autonomy enjoyed by the local governments.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup></blockquote><br>First, under Sections 5,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> 10<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> and 13<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> of the RH Law, the LGUs are not prevented from using their own -funds to provide the specified services therein. The law appears to encourage LGUs to spend for these specified services on the assumption that the LGUs will see for themselves that these services are beneficial to them and, thus, warrant their own expenditure therefor.<br><br>Second, the use of the phrase "shall endeavor" appears only in Sections 5 and 6 of the RH Law. Sections 8,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> 13<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> (last sentence) and 16<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> use the word "shall" relative to the duties required of the LGUs therein. Thus, the duties of the LGUs under these sections are mandatory.<br><br>Third, the <i>ponencia's</i> construction of the word "endeavor" under Sections 5 and 6 of the RH Law might give the wrong impression that the LGUs are not mandated to cooperate with the national government in the implementation of the programs set under these sections. However, the framework of action of the RH Law is based, among others, on the ¦effective partnership between the national government and LGUs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> In fact, the LGUs are effectively designated as implementing agencies of certain, aspects of the programs under the RH Law.<br><br>In line with this policy, a more reasonable interpretation of the phrase "shall endeavor" under Sections 5 and 6 is to read it in conjunction with the <i>proviso</i> (which is identical for both sections) stating that, "Provided, further, That the national government shall provide additional and necessary funding and other necessary assistance for the effective implementation of this provision." Thus, the use of the phrase "shall endeavor" should be understood as a recognition by Congress of the realities on the ground where the LGUs may not have enough funds to fulfill their mandate under these sections. However, if the national government provides for the needed funds, the LGUs cannot refuse to cooperate and do its part in the implementation of these sections. In other words, under -these sections, the law mandates, not merely encourages, LGUs to fulfill their duties unless prevented from doing so for justifiable reasons such as the lack of available funds.<br><br><center><b><u>11. Natural Law</u></b></center><br>I agree with the <i>ponencia</i> that natural law may not, under the particular circumstances of this case, be used to invalidate the RH Law. However, I disagree with the following statements:<br><br><blockquote>While every law enacted by man emananted from what is perceived as natural law, the Court is not obliged to see if a statute, executive issuance or ordinance is in conformity to it. To begin with, it is not enacted by an acceptable legitimate body. Moreover, natural laws are mere thoughts and notions on inherent rights espoused by theorists, philosophers and theologists. The jurists of the .philosophical, school are interested in the law as an abstraction, rather than in the actual law of the past or present.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup></blockquote><br>These statements, I submit, are not necessary in the disposition of this case and appear to be an inaccurate description of natural law. The Court need not foreclose the usefulness of natural law in resolving future cases. I submit that the statement that natural law is not applicable in the resolution of this particular case suffices.<br><br><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, I vote to <b>PARTIALLY GRANT</b> the petitions.<br><br><ol><li>The word "primarily" in Sections 3.01 (a) and 3.01(j) of the Implementing Rules and Regulations is <b>VOID</b> for contravening Section 4(a) of Republic Act No. 10354 and Article II, Section 12 of Constitution.<br><br></li><li>The phrase, "<i>Provided, further, That these hospitals shall immediately refer the person seeking such care and services to another health facility which is conveniently&nbsp; accessible," in Section&nbsp; 7 and&nbsp; the&nbsp; phrase, "however, the conscientious objector shall immediately refer the person seeking such care and services to another health care service provider within the same facility or one which is conveniently accessible</i>" in Section 23(a)(3) of Republic Act No. 10354 are <b>UNCONSTITUTIONAL</b> for violating the Free Exercise of Religion Clause under Article III, Section 5 of the Constitution.

But these are already part of existing laws and no one can object to them. What they do is apparently embellish what the RH Law seeks to accomplish.<br><br>Stripped of euphemisms and the echoes of these principles, what the Saw really wants is to limit population growth with an eye to "sound replacement rate"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> through massive birth control, sex education, and neutralization of opposing views. It seems not to matter that population growth has, according to a United Nations (UN) study, persistently declined in the Philippines from 7.42 per couple in 1950 to 3.27 in 2005-2002<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> which means that couples today have fewer children even without the RH law.<br><br>According to the same UN study, neighboring Asian countries like Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea, and even China which rigidly implemented birth control programs in the past now have worrisome far-below replacement levels. Having developed a mind-set that children are a burden to the family and to the nation, young couples refuse to have them despite government incentives and awards. This prompted former Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kwan Yew to admit in a 2013 speech that "At these low birth rates we will rapidly age and shrink."<br><br>Yet children are not such a burden. Columnist Anne Marie Pamintuan, quoted World Bank's Vice President for East Asia and Pacific, Axel Von Trotsenberg, as saying that "the ultimate asset of the Philippines are itspeople."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br><center><b>Facial Challenge</b></center><br>The <i>ponencia</i> is right that the procedural challenges to the petitions are unmeritorious. In particular, respondents claim that the Court should dismiss these actions since they are a mere facial challenge on the constitutionality of the RH Law as opposed to an actual breach of its provisions and the filing of a case in court on account of such breach. The petitions-should not be allowed, they add, since this challenge is not about the exercise of the freedom of expression, an exception to such limitation.<br><br>But the right to life of the unborn child, which is at the center of these controversies, cannot be compared with rights that are best examined in cases of actual violations. Obviously, the Court cannot wait for the actual extermination of an unborn child before assessing the constitutional validity of the law that petitioners claim to permit such action. A law claimed to threaten a child's right to live sufficiently justifies a constitutional facial challenge.<br><br><center><b>Constitutional Barrier</b></center><br>There is no question of course that every couple planning their family and every woman of ample discernment has the right to use natural or artificial methods to avoid pregnancy. This much is clear. But, in seeking to promote ' the exercise of this right, the RH Law must hurdle certain constitutional barriers: 1) the right to fife of the unborn child that outlaws abortion; 2) the right to health; 3) the free exercise of religion: 4) the right to due process of law; and 4) the freedom of expression.<br><br><center><b>Section 9 and <br>the Right to Life of the Unborn</b></center><br>Section 12, Article II (Declaration of Principles and State Policies), of the 1987 Constitution makes it the duty of the State to protect the right to life of the unborn from conception. Thus<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 12. The State recognizes the sanctity of family life and shall protect and strengthen the family as a basic autonomous social institution. It shall equally protect the life of the mother and the life of the unborn from conception, x x x</blockquote><br><b>1. When Life Begins&nbsp; </b><br><br>When the man's sperm is ejected into the woman's uterus, it travels inward towards the ovary through the fallopian tube. If the ovary has produced and released an ovum, the sperm will meet and fertilize it, producing a zygote, which is a new cell formed by that union. The zygote then travels outward through the fallopian tube towards the uterus, meantime growing into a fleshed embryo, and implants itself on the uterine wall where it will further grow into a fetus and eventually into a full-grown child ready for delivery by its mother at the appropriate time.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Some people believe that the conception of the child begins only from the moment the fleshed embryo implants itself on the mother's uterine wall where it will draw the food and nutrition it needs to survive and grow into a fetus. It is the termination of the embryo or the fetus at this stage, painful, bloody, and depressing, that some are quick to condemn as abortion. Preventing implantation by quietly slaying the zygote or the embryo with little or no blood before it reaches the uterine wall is to them not abortion.<br><br>But they are wrong. The 1987 Constitution is clear: the life of a child begins "from conception" and the dictionary, which is the final arbiter of the common meaning of words, states that "conception" is "the act of being pregnant," specifically, the "formation of a viable zygote."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Science has proved that a new individual comes into being from the moment the zygote is formed. Indeed, the zygote already has a genome (DNA to others) that identifies it as a human being and determines its sex.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> The union of man and woman in the fertilized ovum is the beginning of another person's life.<br><br>With the Constitution, the Filipino people have in effect covenanted that the fertilized ovum or zygote is a person. And it is a covenant that binds. Indeed, the RH Law accepts this inviolable principle and precisely prohibits the use of abortifacient that induces "the prevention of the fertilized ovum to reach and be implanted in the mother's womb." Ambushing the fertilized ovum as it travels down the fallopian tube to prevent its implantation on the uterine wall is abortion.<br><br><b>2. Preventing Fertilization</b><br><br>Since the conception of a child begins from the fertilization of the ovum, it is evident that merely preventing the woman from ovulating to produce ovum or preventing the sperm from fertilizing it does not constitute abortion. Contraception in this sense does not violate the Constitutional right to life since the unborn has not as yet been conceived. The law may authorize or even encourage this kind of contraception since it merely prevents conception. The life of an unborn child is not at stake.<br><br><b>3. Free Access to<br>Contraceptives</b><br><br>Barriers like condoms, diaphragms, and contraceptive sponges as well as the natural rhythm method prevent the meeting of the sperm and the ovum. These methods have not been seriously assailed as abortifacient. But birth control pills and intrauterine devices (IUDs) are another matter. A sector of society led by petitioners vehemently assails them as unsafe and abortifacient, meaning weapons of abortion. And here lies the central issue in this case that will not go away unless resolved.<br><br>Birth control pills are essentially "hormonal"" contraceptives that, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), will avoid conception in two ways: 1) they will prevent the ovary from producing ova or eggs and 2) they will generate thick cervix mucus that would prevent the sperm from reaching and fertilizing the ovum if one is produced. These hormonal contraceptives also come in the forms of injectables with effects that last for about three months; patches that last seven days; or implants on women's upper arms that continuously release drugs from 3 to 5 years.<br><br>IUDs, on the other hand, are small objects that are implanted into the woman's womb, releases chemical substances, and hinders the fertilization of the ovum as its primary function. The IUDs in current use are about the size and shape of a small pendant cross. They prevent conception for 5 or 10 years. One kind is made of copper that releases toxic particles that supposedly kill sperm cells which enter the womb. Another kind releases synthetic hormones into the womb, inducing thick mucus that makes it difficult for the sperm to reach the ovum.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been routinely allowing public access to hormonal contraceptives and IUDs even before the passage of the RH Law. The outcry for the law's passage to make these things available to whoever wants them is the lament of the unenlightened.<br><br>In reality, the government senses a strong resistance to their use, borne of beliefs that they are unsafe and abortifacient. The RH Law precisely aims to put an end to this resistance by imposing certain sanctions against hospitals, physicians, nurses, midwives, and other health care providers who communicate to others the view that contraceptives and IUDs are unsafe and abortifacient, refuse to prescribe them, or decline to perform the required procedures for their use.<br><br><b>4. Legislative Attempt to Settle<br>the Issues against Birth Control <br>Pills and IUDs.</b><br><br>By their nature, hormonal contraceptives and IUDs interfere with the woman" s normal reproductive system. Consequently, the FDA, which has the required technical competence and skills, need to evaluate, test, and ap­prove their use. The RH Law acknowledges this need in its policy statements in Section 2, in its guidelines for implementation in Section 3, and in its definition of terms in Section 4(a). It is consistent with the FDA law and no one can object to it.<br><br>Apparently, however, the FDA's seals of approval have not sufficiently spurred the use of hormonal contraceptives and IUDs. To remedy this and no doubt to quell the belief that they are unsafe and abortifacient. Section 9 of the RH law categorically declares hormonal contraceptives and IUDs "safe"' and "non-abortifacient" like other family planning products and supplies. It also ordains their inclusion in the National Drug Formulary which is also the Essential Drugs List. The first sentence of Section 9 provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 9. <i>The Philippine National Drug Formulary System and Family Planning Supplies.</i> - The National Drug Formulary shall include hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine devices, injectables and other safe, legal, non-abortifacient and effective family planning products and supplies, x x x<br><br>x x x x</blockquote><br>The above apparent!)' elevates into the status of a law the proposition that hormonal contraceptives and IUDs belong to the class of safe and non-abortifacient family planning products and supplies. Indeed, it ordains their inclusion in the National Drug Formulary or Essential Drug List (EDL) to join government approved drugs and devices.<br><br>The second sentence of section 9 of course speaks of inclusion or removal -of family&nbsp; planning supplies from the EDL based on existing practice and in consultation with reputable medical associations, thus:<br><br><blockquote>x x x The Philippine National Drug Formulary System (PNDFS) shall be observed in selecting drugs including family planning supplies that will be included or removed from the Essential Drugs List (EDL) in accordance with existing practice and in consultation with reputable medical associations in the Philippines, x x x</blockquote><br>But the above evidently refers to products and supplies other than the hormonal contraceptives and IlJDs mentioned in the preceding sentence. This is how it should be understood since that preceding sentence already declares these two products as safe and non-abortifacient and must by law be included in that List.<br><br>If the Court were to treat the first sentence of Section 9 above as a legislative mandate that hormonal contraceptives and IUDS are safe and non-abortifacient, then the FDA's former authority to determine whether or not hormonal contraceptives and IUDs are safe and non-abortifacient would be circumscribed. The law would already have made the determination for the FDA.<br><br>The real question before the Court is whether or not Congress can elevate to the status of a law the medical and scientific proposition that hormonal contraceptives and IUDs are safe and non-abortifacient and order their inclusion in the National Drug Formulary without violating the Constitution. Respondents claim that Congress can; petitioners claim otherwise.<br><br>The issue of whether or not hormonal contraceptives and IUDS are safe and non-abortifacient is so central to the aims of the RH Law that the OSG has as a matter of fact been quick to defend the authority of Congress to convert such factual finding into law. The OSG insists that everyone, including the Court, has to defer to this finding considering that the legislature is better equipped to make it. Specifically, the OSG said:<br><br><blockquote>The Congress, employing its vast fact-finding and investigative resources, received voluminous testimony and evidence on whether contraceptives and contraceptive devices are abortifacients. It thereafter made a finding that the used of current reproductive devices is not abortifacient. Such finding of legislative fact, which became the basis for the enactment of the RH Law, should be entitled to great weight and cannot be equated with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of the Congress.</blockquote><br>To support this view, the OSG claims that scientific evidence of the highest standards support the legislative determination in Section 9. It rests on the opinions of a group of Philippine medical experts called the Universal Health Care Study'Group (UHC) and the World Health Organization (WHO). The OSG even submits copies of these opinions as part of its comment and discusses them extensively.<br><br><b>5. UHC Study Group Opinion</b><br><br>But the UHC Study Group based its conclusion that hormonal contraceptives and IUDs are not abortifacient on the belief that abortion refers only to a viable fetus; the death of a mere fertilized ovum in the hand of these contraceptives do not in the mind of this group amount to abortion. Its paper thus states:<br><br><b>Abortion is the termination of an established pregnancy before fetal viability (the fetus' ability to exist independently of the mother). Aside from the 50% of zygotes that are naturally unable to implant, an additional wastage of about 20% of all fertilized eggs occurs due to spontaneous abortions (miscarriages).</b><br><br>The UHC Study Group seems to live in another planet. Its understanding of when the life of the unborn child begins essentially differs from what the Constitution states, i.e., from the time of conception, something that the RH law itself concedes. Consequently, the group's study fails to connect to the issue of when contraceptives act as abortifacients.<br><br>Besides, the UHC Study Group's findings cannot be seriously regarded as near undeniable truth. The UHC group is not a recognized medical or scientific society like the International Union against Cancer or a renowned medical research center like the Mayo Clinic that have reputations for sound medical and scientific studies. The paper it submitted to Congress has not been subjected to any credible and independent peer review. Indeed, the group has never published a paper or study in some reputable scientific or medical journal. Its members met one day in August 2011 and in one sitting found and concluded that existing contraceptives and IUDs are safe and non-abortifacient.<br><br><b>6. WHO Opinions</b><br><br>Congress, according to the OSG relied heavily on WHO's documented opinions regarding the legality and merit of contraceptives. But, firstly, that organization cannot be considered an impartial authority on the use of contraceptives since it has always been a strong advocate of birth control. Its Media Centre Fact Sheet on Family Planning dated May 2013, reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHO is working to promote family planning by producing evidence-based guidelines on safety and service delivery of contraceptive methods, developing quality standards and providing prerqualification of contraceptive commodities, and helping countries introduce, adapt, and implement these tools to meei their needs, x x x</blockquote><br>Secondly, the cited WHO studies are either inconclusive or constitute proof that hormonal contraceptives and IUDs are indeed abortifacient. For instance, the WHO said that "[w]hen used appropriately and in doses/ways recommended, none of these methods have been shown to cause abortion of an implanted fetus."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> That needs repetition: "abortion of an implanted fetus."<br><br>In other words, the only assurance the WHO can give based on its studies is that, when the contraceptive pill has been properly taken, it will not cause "abortion of an implanted fetus." This is of course based on the WHO mind-set that the life of the unborn begins only from the time of the implantation of the fetus on the uterine wall—the same mind-set as the UHC Study Group. But, as repeatedly stated, this contravenes what the Constitution says: the life of the unborn begins "from conception,"'<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> which is from the time of the fertilization of the ovum as the RH law itself acknowledges.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The WHO opinions do not, therefore, connect.<br><br>Notably, the WHO is reluctant to admit that most contraceptives perform three functions: they 1) suppress ovulation; 2) prevent fertilization of an ovum by a sperm; and 3) inhibit implantation of a fertilized ovum in the uterine lining.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> When the first two functions fail and an ovum is nonetheless fertilized (a phenomenon called "breakthrough ovulation"), the contraceptives have the potential for functioning as abortifacient and terminating the fertilized ovum by inhibiting implantation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> This is abortion that the Constitution prohibits.<br><br>Despite its reluctance, however, the WHO implicitly acknowledges the fact in its several opinions given to Congress. For instance, the WHO admits in one of its opinion papers that hormonal contraceptives and IUDs "directly or indirectly have effect on the endometrium that may hypothetically prevent implantation" although "there is no scientific evidence supporting this possibility."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The endometrium is the inner lining of the womb where the embryo lodges, draws food, and develops into a full grown child.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>The WHO's stated opinion stands examination. A hypothesis is a proposition tentatively assumed in order to draw out its logical or empirical consequences and so test its accord with the facts that are known or may be determined.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> This means in this case that the severe harm contraceptives and IUDs inflict on the endomeirium, a known fact, will, given what science knows, logically or empirically prevent implantation and cause abortion. Indeed, the U.S. Physicians Drug Reference for 1978 and 1998 categorically state that an impaired endometrium prevents implantation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Not only this, the WHO further admits that, "[gjiven the high efficacy of combined oral contraceptives in preventing ovulation, it is very unlikely that 'interference with implantation' is a primary mechanism of contraceptive action."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The WHO repeats this point in another paper.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Both statements imply that "interference with implantation," while not a primary mechanism of contraceptives, is its secondary mechanism. This means that they also function as abortifacients.<br><br>More, the WHO also admits that progestin-only hormonal contraceptive can cause the endometrium, where fertilized eggs are implanted, to suffer injury. It said, "Progestin-only methods also cause changes in the endometrium. However, these changes show great variability among patients, from atrophy to normal secretory structures."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> This means that If implantation of a fertilized ovum on the endometrium nonetheless succeeds, the fertilized ovum would still die. As the WHO said in a reply to Congress, a fertilized ovum is not viable unless it is able to implant on a healthy endometrium since there is "very limited amount of metabolic support in a fertilized human egg."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Hormonal contraceptives, like lUDs, have the potential for causing abortion.<br><br>The world is not in want of outstanding international research groups that do not get funding from pro-abortion organizations or states. But Congress had not tapped them. For instance, the International Agency for Research, on Cancer (IARC) said in 2011 that "the progestogen component (of combined hormonal contraceptives) also...reduces the receptivity of the endometrium for implantation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br><b>7. Drug Manufacturers Evidence</b><br><br>Drug manufacturers themselves, whose products the FDA has approved, state in their inserts that their contraceptives perform the dual functions mentioned above. Although the Court is not a trier of facts, it can take judicial notice of facts that are self-evident&nbsp; or&nbsp; are&nbsp; capable of unquestionable demonstration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> All one needs to do is buy such contraceptives from the local drugstore and read the best that the manufacturers can say about their products. One of them, from a popular oral contraceptive Lynstrenol under the brand name of Daphne, was read into the record during the oral argument and had not been challenged. It says:<br><br><blockquote>Pharmacology: mechanics of action:<br><br><u>Effects on Endometrium:</u> Lynestrenol (DAPHNE) impairs implantation, perhaps by altering its special receptors for hormones. It may also be indirectly impaired by interfering with the corpus lutein.<br><br><u>Effects 'on tubal action</u>: Lynestrenol (DAPHNE) affects tubal secretions and microvili, hence blastocyst and ovum transport are delayed.</blockquote><br>Any unnatural delay In the transport of the zygote down through the fallopian tube to the uterine wall will of course prevent timely implantation and cause the fertilized ovum to be aborted. JSince abortion is prohibited in the Philippines, this statement is against the manufacturer's interest and is admissible evidence against it.<br><br>Another hormonal contraceptive is called Trust Pill but goes by the generic name Ethinyl Estradiol, Levonorgestrel, and Ferrous Fumarate, It is manufactured in Thailand by Ponds Chemical and imported by DKT Philippines of Libis, Quezon City. The packet does not bear the restriction that it must be prescribed by a physician. Its insert, also read during the oral argument, states:<br><br><blockquote>Prior to starting Ethinyl Estradiol + Levonorgestrel + Ferrous Fumarate (TRUST PILL) tablet, pregnancy must be ruled out. However, should a pregnancy occur while taking the tablet, the administration has to be withdrawn at once.</blockquote><br>The pill is intended to prevent fertilization of the ovum. But if this is not achieved, it is implicit from the above statement that continued use will harm the fertilized ovum and cause abortion. The manufacturer is compelled to disclose this fact in the insert because abortifacient is illegal in the Philippines. This pill is a double barrelled pill. It shoots the ovum to prevent ovulation and shoots the zygote or little Junior if fertilization takes place-abortion.<br><br>But the irony of this is that women who use Trust Pill presumably do so because they believe that it will prevent conception. Consequently, it is not likely that they would undergo testing for pregnancy from day to day while taking the pill to enable them to decide when to stop using it and have their child.<br><br>Yasmin, a 3rd generation oral contraceptive, has this announcement for online distribution in the Philippines: Yasmin "prevents ovulation (the release of an egg from an ovary) and also causes changes in your cervical and uterine lining, making it harder for sperm to reach the uterus and harder for a fertilized egg to attach to the uterus."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>IUDs also serve as abortifacients. The WHO on whom Congress relied in writing the RH Law said that "During the use of copper-releasing IUDs the reaction is enhanced by the release of copper ions into the luminal fluids of the genital tract, which is toxic to sperm."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> And how do these toxic ions affect the uterus where the fertilized ovum is supposed to implant itself? The WHO said in the same paper<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> that "[t]he major effect of all IUDs is to induce a local inflammatory reaction in the uterine cavity."<br><br>Inflammation is "a condition of some part of the body that is a reaction to injury, infection, irritation, etc. and is characterized by varied combination of redness, pain, heat, swelling, and loss of function."<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[26]</sup></font> In other words, the toxic chemicals from the IUD will cause injury to the uterine cavity, preventing the fertilized egg or embryo from being implanted or, if implanted, from surviving. That is abortion resulting from the use of IUDs.<br><br><b>8. Significance of FDA's<br>"Don't-Use" Certification&nbsp; </b><br><br>Actually, Congress fears that hormonal contraceptives and IUDs perform a third function—disabling the endometrium of uterine lining-—that enable them to serve as weapons of abortion, Proof of this is that the RH Law provides in the third sentence of Section 9 that these contraceptives and devices may, assuming that they also function as abortifacients, pass FDA approval provided the latter issues a certification that they are "not to be used as abortifacient.." Thus:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 9. x x x Any product or supply included or to be included in the EDI. must have a certification from the FDA that said product and supply is made available on the condition that it is not to be used as an abortifacient.</blockquote><br>The above of course makes no sense since the two functions go together and the user has no way, after taking the contraceptive, of stopping the second function from running its course. The bad simply comes with the good. The certification requirement violates the RH Law's tenet that "reproductive health rights do not include...access to abortifacients."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> It also contradicts the RH Law's stated policy of guaranteeing universal access to "non-abortifacient" contraceptives."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Above all, this position is in breach of the provision of the Constitution that outlaws abortion. In any event, I agree with the Court's ruling that the second sentence of Section 9 does not authorize the approval of family planning products and supplies that act as abortifacient.<br><br>This is not to say that all contraceptives and IUDs, present and future, double as abortifacients and are not to be allowed. Annulling Section 9 merely means that it is beyond the powers of Congress to legislate the safe and non-abortifacient status of certain forms of artificial contraceptives. That function must remain with the FDA which has the required scientific and technical skills for evaluating, testing, and approving each contraceptive before it is publicly made available. The manufacturers and distributors have their responsibilities, too. They have to warrant that their products do not function as abortifacients.<br><br>It is appalling, however, that Daphne, Trust Pill, and Yasmin that clearly function as abortifacient passed approval of the FDA. But this is a question that does not have to be answered here. The important thing is that the FDA is to assume as before the responsibility for preventing the violation of the law against abortion. It is of course difficult to be completely positive that a contraceptive primarily intended to prevent ovulation or fertilization of the ovum will absolutely not prevent implantation on the uterine wall and cause abortion. The lack of convincing empirical evidence that it is so may be an acceptable excuse. It is the certainty from the beginning, however, that a given contraceptive has the inherent and substantial potential for causing abortion that is not acceptable. It violates the constitutional right to life of the unborn.<br><br><center><b>Section 9 and <br>the Right to Health</b></center><br>Section 15, Article II, of the 1987 Constitution makes it the duty of the State to "protect and promote the right to health of the people." Health means physical and mental well-being; freedom from disease, pain, or defect; health means normalcy of physical functions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Maternal health according to Section 4 of the RH Law refers to the health of a woman of reproductive age including, but not limited to, during pregnancy, childbirth and the postpartum period.<br><br>This means that women have the right to be free from government-sponsored sickness, government-sponsored pain, and government-sponsored defect. Since healthy vital organs of the body form part of the right to health, women have the right to have normally functioning vital organs. They have the right to walk in the park or in the malls free from debilitating illnesses and free from worries and fears over contraceptives that the government assures them are safe. The government cannot promote family planning programs that violate the women's right to health. A law that misleads women and states that hormonal contraceptives and IUDs are safe violates their constitutional right to health.<br><br><b>1. Safe or Unsafe Use of Hormonal </b><br><br><b>Contraceptives and IUDs</b><br><br>Since the law does not define the meaning of the term "safe," it is to be understood according to its common meaning: "free from harm, injury, or risk."<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[30]</sup></font> The RH Law itself recognizes that the use of contraceptives produces side effects or other harmful results. Thus, it directs the FDA in Section 19 to issue strict guidelines with respect to their use, acknowledging the need for abundant caution.<br><br>Do warnings of side effects and possible lasting harm make contraceptives and IUDs safe? The answer is of course no. For instance, a simple warning against pet snakes would say, "Look at this snake. It is a safe pet to keep in the house. But just don't keep it hungry. Don't forget to close the small door of the cage when you feed it. And watch those small kids."<br><br>It is the same with the warnings for hormonal contraceptives: "This is safe although you will have spotting, breakthrough bleeding, and prolonged periods. Don't worry. You will gain weight, loss your sexual urge, develop pimples, and breast tenderness. You may experience headache and dizziness as well as vaginal dryness. But that is quite alright. Incidentally, on occasions you may have liver disorders, clotting disorders, breast and cervical cancer, sickle-cell anemia, hormone-active tumors, hyperlipidemia, severe cardiovascular diseases, previous or existing thrombo embolic disease, and idiopathic jaundice. It is possible you will have a heart attack. I won't worry if I were you."<br><br>The dangers of those side effects are more worrisome since the RH Law fails to provide standards of safe use of contraceptives such as:<br><blockquote>(a) a prescribed standard of tolerance for side effects.<br>(b) the service of a qualified physician who can advice the user, especially the poor, of the dangers of contraceptives, not just literature written in English so she can make intelligent choice;<br>(c) the service of a qualified physician who will, while she is under contraceptives, monitor their effects on her, treat her for adverse side effects and complications, and provide her with the right medicine; and<br>(d) the contraceptives she takes do not act at the same time as abortifacients in case&nbsp; an ovum is fertilized despite the use of such contraceptives.<br></blockquote><br>The fact is that contraceptives interfere with normal body functions. Women have ovaries so these can produce ova or eggs that can be fertilized to ensure procreation and the continuation of the human race. Contraceptives prevent healthy ovaries from ovulating, which is the reason for their being ovaries. One cannot disable the woman's ovaries or monkey with its functions .for long periods without affecting her health. Medical studies and reports show this to be the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br><b>2.&nbsp; Drug's Side Effects<br>Versus Benefits</b><br><br>The OSG of course points out that, on balance, the side effects mentioned are outweighed like most medicines by the benefits that their use will bring. But that is a false analogy. Medicine is intended to cure illness. Consequently, the doctor can balance the illness that it wants to cure against the illness that its side effects bring. They are on the same level of exchange: a minor illness weighed against a major illness. For instance, the fact that medicine X may cause manageable problems in the patient's liver is outweighed by the fact that it can, more than any other medicine, hinder a fatal heart attack.<br><br>Obviously, this kind of balancing cannot apply to artificial contraceptives since the harm or illness they can cause users, especially women, is not on the same level of exchange as the consequent benefit, namely, sexual pleasure without pregnancy. Besides, other methods that produce no side effects exist. A WHO 2013 report that such methods have good results when used properly. Their rates of success under correct and consistent use are: male condoms 98%; withdrawal 96%; fertility awareness method 95-97%; and abstinence: 100%<br><br>This is not to say that contraceptives and IUDs can pass approval by the FDA only if they are absolutely safe. This is unrealistic and the Court must trust married couples and mature women to have the proper discernment for deciding whether to take the risk of their side effects. But the FDA should not trust the manufacturers and distributors with unbridled authority to write their own guidelines to users. It must see to it that these guidelines disclose those side effects in clear and understandable terms from the layman's point of view.<br><br><b>3. Substantive Due Process</b><br><br>The legislature's attempt to elevate into law its arbitrary finding that hormonal contraceptives and IUDs are safe and non-abortifacient is irrational. The determination of what medicine is safe and useful to a person is a function of the science of medicine and pharmacy. It is not for the Court or the legislature to determine. Raising present-day scientific or medical views regarding contraceptives to the level of law, when contested by opposing scientific or medical views, is an arbitraiy exercise of legislative power:<br><br>Medical and scientific findings are constantly changing. For example, the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the WHO reported that it was once believed that combined raenopausal therapy was "possibly carcinogenic to humans." But the WHO cancer research organization said in 2005 that "The new evaluation concluded, based on an expanded study base, that it is carcinogenic to humans [not just possibly carcinogenic], increasing a woman's risk of breast cancer." In fact, this research organization places oral contraceptives in the highest grade of cancer-producing products. Still, Congress would declare by force of law that oral contraceptives are safe. God save this country if it must rely and stake the lives of its people on Congressional judgment regarding scientific and medical truths.<br><br>Fortunately, the Court rules in this case that Congress cannot elevate into law its view that hormonal contraceptives and intrauterine devices are safe and non-abortifacient. The first sentence of Section 9 should be construed as ordaining their inclusion in the National Drug Formulary only after they have been tested, evaluated, and approved by the FDA. Only the FDA is competent to determine whether a particular hormonal contraceptive or intrauterine device is safe and non-abortifacient. This finds support in the second sentence of Section 9 that provides a process for the inclusion or removal of family planning supplies from the National Drug Formulary.<br><br><center><b>Section 7, Section 23(a)(3),<br>Section 23(a)(2), Section 23(b).<br>and the Free Exercise of Religion</b></center><br><br>Section 7 of the RH Law requires all public health facilities to provide the full range of family planning services. This is also required of private health facilities, except in the case of non-maternity specialty hospitals and those operated by religious groups. The latter hospitals are, however, required to immediately refer the person seeking such services to the nearest health care facility that will do the task. Thus, Section 7 provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 7. <i>Access to Family Planning. </i>- All accredited public health facilities shall provide a full range of modem family planning methods, which shall also include medical consultations, supplies and necessary and reasonable procedures for poor and marginalized cou­ ples having infertility issues who desire to have children: Provided, That family planning services shall likewise be extended by private health facilities to paying patients with the option to grant free care and services to indigents. except in the case of non-maternity specialty hospitals and hospitals owned and operated by a religious group, but they have the option to provide such full range of modern family planning methods; <b>Provided, further, That these hospitals shall immediately refer the person seeking such care and services to another health facility which is conveniently accessible</b>: Provided, finally. That the person is not in an emergency condition or serious case as defined in Republic Act No. 8344. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Related to the above is Section 23(a)(3) of the RH Law that makes it a crime for any health care service provider (hospital, clinic, doctor, nurse, midwife, and health worker),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> whether public or private, to refuse to extend quality health care services and information on account of the person's marital status, gender, age, religious convictions, personal circumstances, or nature of work.<br><br>The law provides, however, that the health care service provider's objection based on his or her ethical or religious beliefs is to be respected. Thus, he or she is not to be compelled to render the services that would interfere with the natural human reproduction process if the same conflicts with his conscience. This is consistent with Section 5, Article III of the 1987 Constitution which provides that no law shall be made prohibiting a person's free exercise of his religion.<br><br>But the irony of it is that at the next breath the RH Law would require the conscientious objector to immediately refer the person, whose wants he declines to serve, to the nearest health care service provider who will do what he would not. The penalty for failing to do this is imprisonment for 1 to 6 months or payment of a fine of PI 0,000 to PI 00,000 or both imprisonment and fine. If the offender is a juridical person, the penalty shall be imposed on its president or responsible officer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Specifically, Section 23(a)(3) provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 23. <i>Prohibited Acts</i>. - The following acts are prohib­ited: (a) Any health care service provider, whether public or private, who shall;<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(3) Refuse to extend quality health care services and in­formation on account of the person's marital status, gender, age, reli­gious convictions, personal circumstances, or nature of work: <b>Pro­vided, That the conscientious objection of a health care service provider based on his/her ethical or religious beliefs shall be re­spected; however, the conscientious objector shall immediately re­fer the person seeking such care and services to another health care service provider within the same facility or one which is con­veniently accessible:</b> x x x</blockquote><br>Section 23(a)(3) makes no sense. It recognizes the constitutional right of the conscientious objector not to provide artificial contraceptives that he believes would kill the unborn after it has been conceived. Yet, he must help see it done by someone else. For instance, the Catholic religion might consider it a sin similar to murder to implant a copper IUD into a woman since it would kill the unborn by preventing it from attaching to a womb atrophied by poison from the IUD. The RH law respects the Catholic doctor's right to refuse to do what his faith regards as murder. But he must hasten, at the pain of punishment, to refer the woman to another doctor who is willing to do it.<br><br>So if the law would excuse the Catholic doctor from committing what in his faith amounts to murder, would it be reasonable for the law to compel him to help the woman and show her how she can have her child murdered by another doctor? If so, the Catholic doctor would in effect say to the other doctor, "I can't murder this woman's child but please do it in my place." This definitely compels him to do something against his conscience in violation of his constitutional right to the free exercise of his religion.<br><br>The OSG cites the <i>Ebralinag</i> case<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> concerning students who were members of the Jehovah's witnesses. They refused to salute the flag and for this reason were expelled from school. But the Court said that compelling them to salute the flag would violate their religious belief that salutes are reserved to-God. It is the same here in the sense that the RH law actually recognizes the right of a Catholic doctor not to be compelled to implant a copper IUD into a woman's womb because it amounts, according to his religious belief, to the murder of an unborn child. The Constitution and the law respect's the doctor's religious belief.<br><br>Of course, as the OSG points out, school authorities are not powerless to discipline Jehovah's witnesses' members if they commit breaches of the peace by disruptive actions that would prevent others, like their classmates and teachers, from peacefully saluting the flag and singing the national anthem. The OSG implies from this that while the RH Law can similarly respect the conscientious objector's right not to do what his religion forbids, it can compel him help the person get the declined service from another health care service provider.<br><br>But it is clear from <i>Ebralinag</i> that what is required of the Jehovah's witnesses is to respect the right of other students and their teachers by-keeping quiet and not disrupting the flag ceremony. Keep quiet and let alone; that is the rule. In the case of the Catholic doctor, he should do nothing to impose his religious belief on the woman. He should do nothing that will deny the woman her right to get that copper IUD implantation elsewhere. Like the Jehovah's witnesses, the equivalent conduct for the Catholic doctor is to keep quiet and let alone.<br><br>Unfortunately, the RH Law requires him to take steps to ensure that the woman is pointed to another place where she could get the IUD implantation she wants. In effect, the law compels the doctor to do more than just keep quiet and let alone It compels him at the pains of going to jail to get involved and help in the commission of what his religious belief regards as amounting to the murder of a child. And this is in order to satisfy the need of the woman and her partner for sex without pregnancy. Remember, this is not the case of a bleeding woman needing immediate medical attention.<br><br>The Court has correctly decided to annul Section 23(a)(3) and the corresponding provision in the RH-IRR, particularly section 5.24, as unconstitutional insofar as they punish any health care provider who fails and/or refuses to refer a patient not, in an emergency or life-threatening case, to another health care service provider within the same facility or one which is conveniently accessible regardless of his or her religious beliefs.<br><br><center><b>Section 23(a)(l) and the <br>Principle of Void for Vagueness</b></center><br><br>Due process demands that the terms of a penal statute must be sufficiently clear to inform those who may be subjected to it what conduct will render them liable to its penalties. A criminal statute that "fails to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden by statute," or is so indefinite that "it encourages arbitrary and erratic arrests and convictions," is void for vagueness. A vague or indefinite statute is unconstitutional because it places the accused on trial for an offense, the nature of which he is given no fair warning.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Section 23(a)(l) of the RH Law provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 23. <i>Prohibited Acts. </i>-The following acts are prohibited: (a) Any health care service provider, whether public or private, who shall:<br><blockquote>(1) Knowingly withhold information or restrict the dissemination thereof, and/or intentionally provide incorrect information regarding programs and services on reproductive health including the right to informed choice and access to a fufl range of legal, medically-safe, non-abortifacient and effective family planning methods;</blockquote></blockquote><br>The public health care service provider referred to are of course the hospitals, the doctors, the nurses, the midwives, and the other health workers described elsewhere in the law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> They will, if found guilty of the offense, suffer imprisonment of 1 to 6 months or a fine of PI0,000 to PI00,000 or both imprisonment and fine.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Petitioners contend that Section 23(a)(l) above is void for vagueness. But some points out that the term "knowingly" used in the law, assailed by petitioners as vague, is sufficiently clear in that it means awareness or deliberateness that is intentional and connotes malice.<br><br>But "knowingly" and "maliciously" have meanings that set them apart. "Knowingly" means mere awareness or deliberateness. "Maliciously," on the other hand, connotes an "evil intention."<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[38]</sup></font> If the law meant to include malice as an ingredient of the offense described in Section 23(a)(l), it would have added the term "maliciously" to "knowingly." Nothing in the wordings of the law implies malice and the need for criminal intent. The crime as described is <i>malum prohibition</i>.<br><br>The term "knowingly" is vague in the context of the law because it does not say how much information the offender must have regarding those programs and services as to charge with an obligation to impart it to others and be penalized if he "knowingly" fails to do so. The depth of a person's information about anything varies with the circumstances.<br><br>One who is running the programs or sendees would naturally have the kind of information that obligates him to disclose them to those who seek the same and be punished if he "knowingly" refuses to do so. Yet, this circumstance of direct involvement in the program or sendee is not required in Section 23(a)(l). On the other hand, one who merely reads about those programs and services, like a private hospital nurse who receives a letter offering free program on birth control, would know little of the detailed contents of that program and the competence of those who will run it. But since the law also fails to state what the term "information" means, that private nurse could be charged with "knowingly" withholding information about the birth control program she learned from reading mails if she does not disseminate it to others.<br><br>Another element of the offense is that the health care service provider must knowingly withhold or restrict dissemination of the information that he has. It fails to state, however, to whom he has an obligation to make a disclosure. It also gives him no discretion to decide to whom such information would be suitable and to whom not. Consequently, the health care service provider would be vulnerable to charges of violation of the law where he is denied the chance to know before hand when the obligation to disclose presents itself.<br><br><center><b>Section 23(a)(l) and<br>the Freedom of Expression</b></center><br>Section 23(a)(l) also punishes any health care service provider who knowingly provides "incorrect" information regarding programs and services on reproductive health. But the RH Law does not define what is "correct" or "incorrect" information regarding such programs and services. And it does not require the publication of what information are "correct" and what are "incorrect" sufficient to put prospective offenders on guard.<br><br>Besides there is no final arbiter in the world over issues concerning correct or incorrect reproductive health science on which reproductive health programs and services must depend. For instance, while Section 9 regards as law the scientific proposition that hormonal contraceptives and IUDs are safe and non-abortifacient, there is abundant medical and scientific evidence, some from the WHO itself that they are not.<br><br>If the legislature can dictate what the truth is regarding medical and scientific issues of the day and send to jail those who disagree with it, this country would be -in deep trouble. They threw Galileo into jail for saying that the earth was round when the authorities of his time believed that it was flat. Public health will be endangered if Congress can legislate a debatable scientific or medical proposition into a binding law and punish all dissenters, depriving them of their freedom of expression.<br><br>Most competent doctors read the latest in scientific and medical journals and reports. If these convince a doctor that oral pills and copper IUDs are not safe or work as abortifacient, he would be unable to tell his patients these until the law is repealed. Otherwise, he would be giving them "incorrect" information that would send him to jail. This places a health issue affecting public interest outside the scope of scientific and medical investigation.<br><br>The doctors who make up the Universal Health Care Study Group, on whose paper Congress relied on, hold the view that the life of the unborn child begins only from the moment of implantation of the embryo on the uterine wall, contrary to what the Constitution provides. This means that if they provide such "incorrect" information to their patients, they could go to jail for it. But no law should be passed outlawing medical or scientific views that take exceptions from current beliefs.<br><br>Moreover, the State guarantees under Section 2 of the RH Law the right of every woman to consider all available reproductive health options when making her decision. This implies that she has the right to seek advice from anyone she trusts. Consequently, if a woman wanting to space her pregnancy seeks the advice of a Catholic physician she trusts, the latter should not be sent to jail for expressing his belief that taking oral pills or using copper IUDs can cause abortion that her faith prohibits. This is valid even if others do not share the faith. Religious conscience is precisely a part of the consideration for free choice in family planning.<br><br>I concede, however, that my above views on Section 23(a)(l) could be better appreciated in actual cases involving its application rather than in the present case where I go by the bare provisions of the law. For now I am satisfied that Section 23(a)(l) has been declared void and unconstitutional insofar as it punishes any health care provider who fails or refuses to disseminate information regarding programs and services on reproductive health regardless of his or her religious beliefs.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Section 3(c), Republic Act 10354.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> World Population Prospects: 2008 revision, (n.d.)

I agree that Section 7, <b>inasmuch as it dispensed with the requirement of parental consent</b>, is unconstitutional. Nevertheless, in addition to ponencia's ratiocination on the right to privacy, I would discuss further that Section 7, by dispensing with the requirement of parental consent for minors in certain cases, violates Section 12, Article II of the 1987 Constitution.<br><br>I agree with the <i>ponencia's </i>conclusion that the attack on the constitutionality of Section 14, which provides for age- and development­ appropriate reproductive health education to adolescents, must fail. However, I disagree with the <i>ponencia</i> insofar as it declared that the issues raised against the constitutionality of Section 14 are premature as the Department of Education (DepEd) has yet to prepare a curriculum on age­ and development-appropriate reproductive health education. The Court has already made pronouncements on the constitutionality of the other provisions of R.A. No. 10354 despite the lack of an actual case or controversy, the issues presented being matters of transcendental importance. There is thus no reason for the Court to avoid a definitive ruling on the constitutionality of Section 14. It is my view, which I will expound later, that Section 14 does not: (1) violate the academic freedom of educational institutions; (2) intrude into the natural and primary right of parents to rear their children; and (3) amount to an infringement of the freedom of religion.<br><br>I dissent, however, from the <i>ponencia's</i> conclusion that the following provisions ofR.A.

No. 10354 pertinently provides that:<br><br><blockquote>Section 7. <i>Access to Family Planning. -</i> All accredited public health facilities shall provide a full range of modem family planning methods, which shall also include medical consultations, supplies and necessary and reasonable procedures for poor and marginalized couples having infertility issues who desire to have children: <i>Provided, </i>That family planning services shall likewise be extended by private health facilities to paying patients with the option to grant free care and services to indigents, except in the case of non-maternity specialty hospitals and hospitals owned and operated by a religious group, but they have the option to provide such full range of modern family planning methods:<i> Provided, further, </i>That these hospitals shall immediately refer the person seeking such care and services to another health facility which is conveniently accessible: Provided, finally, That the person is not in an emergency condition or serious case as defined in Republic Act No. 8344.<br><br>No person shall be denied information and access to family planning services, whether natural or artificial: <i>Provided, </i>That minors will not be allowed access to modern methods of family planning without written consent from their parents or guardian/s except when the minor is already a parent or has had a miscarriage.</blockquote><br>Section 7 seeks to make modem family planning methods more accessible to the public. The provision mandates that no person shall be denied information and access to family planning services, whether natural or artificial. However, the last <i>proviso</i> of Section 7 restricts the access of minors to modem methods of family planning; it requires a written parental consent before a minor may be allowed access thereto. This is but recognition of the parental authority that is exercised by parents over the persons of their unemancipated children. That it is both a duty and a right of the parents to protect the physical health of their unemancipated children.<br><br>However, Section 7 provided an exception to the requirement of written parental consent for minors. A minor who is already a parent or has had a miscarriage may be allowed access to modem methods of family planning notwithstanding the absence of a written parental consent therefor. This runs afoul of the natural and primary right and duty of parents in the rearing of their children, which, under Section 12, Article II of the Constitution, should receive the support of the government.<br><br>There exists no substantial distinction as between a minor who 1s already a parent or has had a miscarriage and a minor who is not yet a parent or never had a miscarriage. There is no cogent reason to require a written parental consent for a minor who seeks access to modem family planning methods and dispense with such requirement if the minor is already a parent or has had a miscarriage. Under the Family Code, all minors, generally, regardless of his/her circumstances, are still covered by the parental authority exercised by their parents. That a minor is already a parent or has had a miscarriage does not operate to divest his/her parents of their parental authority; such circumstances do not emancipate a minor.<br><br>It is cardinal with us that the custody, care and nurture of the child reside first in the parents, whose primary function and freedom include preparation for obligations the State can neither supply nor hinder.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Most children, even in adolescence, simply are not able to make sound judgments concerning many decisions, including their need for medical care or treatment.

No. 10354 mandates the provision of age- and development-appropriate reproductive health education, which would be taught to adolescents<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[14]</sup></font> in public schools by adequately trained teachers. The curriculum on age- and development-appropriate reproductive health education, which shall be formulated by the DepEd after consultation with parents-teachers-community associations, shall include subjects such as: values formation; knowledge and skills in self-protection against discrimination; sexual abuse and violence against women and children and other forms of gender based violence and teen pregnancy; physical, social and emotional changes in adolescents; women's rights and children's rights; responsible teenage behavior; gender and development; and responsible parenthood.<br><br>The petitioners claim that Section 14, by mandating the inclusion of age- and development-appropriate reproductive health education to adolescents, violates the academic freedom of educational institutions since they will be compelled to include in their curriculum a subject, which, based on their religious beliefs, should not be taught to students.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>The petitioners' claim is utterly baseless. Section 5(2), Article XIV of the Constitution guarantees all institutions of higher learning academic freedom. The institutional academic freedom includes the right of the school or college to decide and adopt its aims and objectives, and to determine how these objections can best be attained, free from outside coercion or interference, save possibly when the overriding public welfare calls for some restraint. The essential freedoms subsumed in the term "academic freedom" encompass the freedom of the school or college to determine for itself: (1) who may teach; (2) what may be taught; (3) how lessons shall be taught; and (4) who may be admitted to study.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>An analysis of the foregoing claim requires a dichotomy between public and private educational institutions. The last sentence of Section 14 provides that the age- and development-appropriate reproductive health curriculum that would be formulated by the DepEd "shall be used by public schools and <b>may be adopted</b> by private schools." The mandated reproductive health education would only be compulsory for public schools. Thus, as regards private educational institutions, there being no compulsion, their constitutional right to academic freedom is not thereby violated.<br><br>As regards public educational institutions, though they are mandatorily required to adopt an age- and development-appropriate reproductive health education curriculum, the claimed curtailment of academic freedom is still untenable. Section 4(1), Article XIV of the Constitution provides that "[t]he State x x x shall exercise reasonable supervision and regulation of all educational institutions." The constitutional grant of academic freedom does not withdraw from the State the power to supervise and regulate educational institutions, whether public or private. The only requirement imposed by the Constitution on the State's supervision and regulation of educational institutions is that the exercise thereof must be reasonable.<br><br>Congress deemed it appropriate to include a provision on age- and development-appropriate reproductive health education as a means to address the rise of teenage pregnancies.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> In a 2002 survey conducted by the University of the Philippines Population Institute, it was shown that 23% of young people aged 15 to 24 years old had already engaged in pre-marital sex; that pre-marital sex was prevalent among 31.1% of the boys and 15.4°/o among the girls.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> The survey, after a consideration of other factors, concluded that many young people, despite having inadequate knowledge on reproductive health problems, engage in risky sexual behavior.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> That, despite having liberal views on sex and related matters, they rarely seek medical help for reproductive health problems.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Poignantly, given this factual milieu, the provision on age- and development-appropriate reproductive health education under Section 14 is reasonable.<br><br>The importance of integrating the subject of the dangers and dire consequences of alcohol abuse or even the menace of dangerous drugs in the curricula of primary and secondary educational institutions cannot be disputed. The prevalence of teenage pregnancy and the risks surrounding it is just as equally alarming as the dangers of alcohol and substance abuse. Accordingly, I find nothing objectionable in the integration of age- and development-appropriate reproductive health education in the curricula of primary and secondary schools.<br><br>The petitioners further assert that Section 14 violates the right to privacy of the parents as it amounts to a denigration of "the sanctity of the family home" and has "usurped the rights and duties of parents to rear and educate their children in accordance with their religious conviction by forcing some rules and State programs for reproductive health contrary to their religious beliefs." The petitioners claim that parents have the primary duty to educate their children, especially on matters affecting reproductive health. They thus allege that the State's interference in such a delicate parental task is unwarranted and should not be countenanced.<br><br>It is conceded that parents, as stated earlier, indeed have the natural and primary right and duty in the rearing of their children.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> The Constitution further affirms such right and duty by mandating that the State, in providing compulsory elementary education for all children of school age, is proscribed from imposing a limitation on the natural rights of parents to rear their children.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> At the core of the foregoing constitutional guarantees is the right to privacy of the parents in the rearing of their children.<br><br>Essentially, the question that has to be resolved is whether the inclusion of age- and development-appropriate reproductive health education in the curriculum of primary and secondary schools violates the right to privacy of the parents in the rearing of their children. The standard to be used in determining the validity of a government regulation, which is claimed to infringe the right to privacy of the people, was explained by the United States (US) Supreme Court in the land mark case of <i>Griswold v. Connecticut</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> in this wise:<br><br><blockquote>The present case, then, concerns a relationship lying within the zone of privacy created by several fundamental constitutional guarantees. And it concerns a law which, in forbidding the use of contraceptives, rather than regulating their manufacture or sale, seeks to achieve its goals by means having a maximum destructive impact upon that relationship. Such a law cannot stand in light of the familiar principle, so often applied by this Court,<b> that a governmental purpose to control or prevent activities constitutionally subject to state regulation may not be achieved by means which sweep unnecessarily broadly and thereby invade the area of protected freedoms.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> (Emphasis ours)</blockquote><br>Thus, when a government regulation is claimed to infringe on the right to privacy, courts are required to weigh the State's objective against the privacy rights of the people. Although considered a fundamental right, the right to privacy may nevertheless succumb to a narrowly drawn government regulation, which advances a legitimate and overriding State interest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>As explained earlier, Section 14 aims to address the increasing rate of teenage pregnancies in the country and the risks arising therefrom, which is undeniably a legitimate and overriding State interest. The question that has to be asked then is whether Section 14, in advancing such legitimate and overriding State interest, has employed means, which are narrowly tailored so as not to intrude into the right to privacy of the people.<br><br>Under Section 14, the formulation of the curriculum on age- and development-appropriate reproductive health education is a collaborative process. It provides "[t]hat flexibility in the formulation and adoption of appropriate course content, scope and methodology in each educational level or group shall be allowed <b>only after consultations with parents-teachers­ community associations, school officials and other interest groups.</b>" Section 14 thus takes into account the relevant concerns of parents and other interest groups in the adoption and implementation of the proposed age- and development-appropriate reproductive health education; any and all objections thereto based on religious beliefs would be considered during the formulation of the curriculum. In this sense, Section 14, in taking into account the relevant concerns of parents and other interest groups in the formulation of the curriculum, has been narrowly tailored so as not to invade the right to privacy of the parents.<br><br>Equally untenable is the petitioners' claim that the provision of age­ and development-appropriate reproductive health education under Section 14 unduly burdens their freedom of religion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> A similar claim was resolved by the <i>Supreme Court of Hawaii in Medeiros v.

In declaring the statute unconstitutional, the US Supreme Court declared that:<br><br><blockquote>Government in our democracy, state and national, must be neutral in matters of religious theory, doctrine, and practice. It may not be hostile to any religion or to the advocacy of no-religion, and it may not aid, foster, or promote one religion or religious theory against another or even against the militant opposite. <b>The First Amendment mandates governmental neutrality between religion and religion, and between religion and nonreligion.</b><br><br><b>As early as 1872, this Court said: "The law knows no heresy, and is committed to the support of no dogma, the establishment of no sect.</b>" <i>Watson v.

The <i>ponencia</i> explained that "[o]nee the medical practitioner, against his will, refers a patient seeking information on modem reproductive health products, services, procedures and methods, his conscience is immediately burdened as he has been compelled to perform an act against his beliefs."

Accommodations are government policies that take religion specifically into account</b> not to promote the government's favored form of religion, but <b>to <i>allow individuals and groups to exercise their religion without hindrance</i>.</b> Their purpose or effect therefore is to remove a burden on, or facilitate the exercise of a person's or institution's religion. As Justice Brennan explained, the "government [may] take religion into account . . . <b><i>to exempt, when possible, from generally applicable governmental regulation</i> individuals whose religious beliefs and practices would othenvise thereby be infringed</b>, or to create without state involvement an atmosphere in which voluntary religious exercise may flourish." x x x Accomodation is forbearance and not alliance.

No. 10354 is to provide marginalized sectors of society, particularly the women and the poor, access to reproductive health care services, and to health care in general, of which they have been deprived for many decades due to discrimination and lack of access to information.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>Sections 7 and 23(a)(3) effectuate the foregoing objectives that R.A. No. 10354 seeks to attain. Section 7, as stated earlier, facilitates the access by the public, especially the poor and marginalized couples having infertility issues desiring to have children, to modem family planning methods. It thus mandates all accredited public health facilities to provide a full range of modem family planning methods, which includes medical consultations, supplies and procedures. Private health facilities are likewise required to extend family planning services to paying patients.<br><br>On the other hand, Section 23(a)(3) penalizes the refusal of any health care service provider to extend quality reproductive health care services and information on account of the patient's marital status, gender, age, religious convictions, personal circumstances, or nature of work. Thus:<br><br><blockquote>Section 23.<i> Prohibited Acts.</i>- The following acts are prohibited:<br><br>(a) Any health care service provider, whether public or private, who shall:<br><blockquote>xxxx<br><br>(3) Refuse to extend quality health care services and information on account of the person's marital status, gender, age, religious convictions, personal circumstances, or nature of work: <i><b>Provided</b></i><b>, That the conscientious objection of a health care service provider based on his/her ethical or religious beliefs shall be respected; however, the conscientious objector shall immediately refer the person seeking such care and services to another health care service provider within the same facility or one which is conveniently accessible:</b> <i>Provided, further,</i> That the person is not in an emergency condition or serious case as defined in Republic Act No. 8344, which penalizes the refusal of hospitals and medical clinics to administer appropriate initial medical treatment and support in emergency and serious cases;<br><br>x x x x (Emphasis ours)</blockquote></blockquote><br>Nevertheless, although Section 7 provides "that family planning services shall likewise be extended by private health facilities to paying patients," it nevertheless exempts "non-maternity specialty hospitals and<b> hospitals owned and operated by a religious group</b>" from providing full range of modem family planning methods. Instead, Section 7 imposes on non-maternity specialty hospitals and hospitals owned and operated by a religious group the duty to immediately refer patients seeking reproductive health care and services to another health facility that is conveniently accessible.<br><br>In the same manner, the prohibition imposed under Section 23(a)(3) is not absolute; it recognizes that a health care service provider may validly refuse to render reproductive health services and information if he/she conscientiously objects thereto ''based on his/her ethical or religious beliefs." Nevertheless, Section 23(a)(3) likewise imposes a corresponding duty on such conscientious objector to immediately refer the person seeking reproductive health services to another health care service provider within the same facility or one, which is conveniently accessible.<br><br>It cannot be denied that the State has a legitimate interest in the promotion and protection of the right to reproductive health of the people. The question that has to be resolved then is whether such interest can be considered compelling as to justify any incidental burden on the free exercise of religion.<br><br>The determination of whether there exists a compelling state interest that would justify an incidental burden involves balancing the interest of the State against religious liberty to determine which is more compelling under the particular set of facts. In assessing the state interest, the court will have to determine the importance of the secular interest and the extent to which that interest will be impaired by an exemption for the religious practice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, the supposed burden on the religious freedom of conscientious objectors in complying with the "duty to refer" would have to be weighed against the State's interest in promoting the right of the people to reproductive health.<br><br>According to the 2010 State of World Population prepared by the United Nations Population Fund, in the Philippines, 230 mothers die out of every 100,000 live births while 21 infants die out of every 1,000 live births.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Daily, there are about 15 women dying due to childbirth and pregnancy related complications.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> About 11% of all deaths among women of reproductive age in the Philippines are due to maternal death.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Further, for every minute, 3 babies are born, and for every 1000 babies born, 33 die before reaching age five. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> The foregoing statistics paints a harrowing tale of the state of the country's reproductive health. It is quite unfortunate that the country has a high rate of maternal and infant deaths, when it can be significantly reduced with proper and effective reproductive health care.<br><br>No less distressing is the state of unintended pregnancies, and its equally harrowing consequences, in the country. According to a study prepared by the Alan Guttmacher Institute (AGI), there were 1.9 million unintended pregnancies in the Philippines in 2008, resulting in two main outcomes-unplanned births and unsafe abortions. In the Philippines, 37% of all births are either not wanted at the time of pregnancy (mistimed) or entirely unwanted, and 54% of all pregnancies are unintended. The AGI further discovered that, on average, Filipino women give birth to more children than they want, which is particularly striking among the poorest Filipino women, who have nearly two children more than they intend to have.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>The AGI stressed that the foregoing statistics can be attributed to low contraceptive use and high levels of unmet need for contraception. The AGI pointed out that in 2008, more than 90% of unintended pregnancies occurred among women using traditional, ineffective methods or no method at all. The study further showed that poor women are less likely to use a contraceptive method than non-poor women (43% vs. 51%), and in regions where poverty is common, contraceptive use is substantially lower than the national average--<i>e.g</i>., 38% in the Zamboanga Peninsula and 24% in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>The present condition of the country's reproductive health care, taken together with the Constitution's mandate to promote and protect the right to health of the people, constitutes a compelling state interest as would justify an incidental burden on the religious freedom of conscientious objectors. Sections 7 and 23(a)(3) of R.A. No. 10354 were crafted to ensure that the government's effort in disseminating information and providing access to services and programs on reproductive health would not be stymied. The said provisions seek to improve the condition of the reproductive health care in the country.<br><br>Nevertheless, Congress recognized that, in enacting regulations to further the reproductive health of the people, including access to modem family planning methods, resistance thereto based on religious scruples would abound. Notwithstanding the presence of a compelling state interest in the promotion and protection of reproductive health, Congress deemed it proper to carve out exemptions that specifically take into account the religious dissensions of conscientious objectors, which effectively exempts them from the requirements imposed under Sections 7 and 23(a)(3). In this regard, it cannot thus be claimed that the said provisions invidiously interfere with the free exercise of religion.<br><br>Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that the government's effort to provide increased access to information, programs, and services regarding reproductive health would be seriously hampered by the exemption accorded to conscientious objectors. A considerable number of health facilities in the country are owned and operated by religious institutions. Likewise, being a predominantly Catholic country, there are a considerable number of health service providers who, due to their religious convictions, view modem methods of family plarming, a major component of reproductive health under R.A. No. 10354, as immoral.<br><br>In view of the accommodation granted to conscientious objectors under Sections 7 and 23(a)(3), a great portion of the public would still be denied access to information, programs, and services regarding reproductive health, thus, effectively defeating the lofty objectives of R.A. No. 10354. Thus, Congress, still recognizing the religious freedom of conscientious objectors, instead imposed on them the "duty to refer" the patients seeking reproductive health care and service to another health facility or reproductive health care service provider. Under the circumstances, the "duty to refer" imposes the least possible interference to the religious liberties of conscientious objectors.<br><br>Thus, the "duty to refer" imposed by Sections 7 and 23(a)(3) does not invidiously interfere with the religious freedom of conscientious objectors; any discomfort that it would cause the conscientious objectors is but an incidental burden brought about by the operation of a facially neutral and secular regulation. Not all infringements of religious beliefs are constitutionally impermissible. Just as the religious freedom of conscientious objectors must be respected, the higher interest of the State should likewise be afforded utmost protection.<br><br>Conscientious scruples have not, in the course of the long struggle for religious toleration, relieved an individual from obedience to a general law not aimed at the promotion or restriction of religious beliefs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> particularly in this case where the provisions in question have already given accommodation to religious dissensions.

Section 23(a)(l), in relation to Section 23(a)(3), recognizes that a conscientious objector cannot be compelled to provide information on reproductive health if the same would go against his/her religious convictions. In such cases, however, the conscientious objector, pursuant to Section 23(a)(3), has the correlative duty to immediately refer the person seeking information on programs and services on reproductive health to another health care service provider within the same facility or one which is conveniently accessible.<br><br>However, a health care service provider who knowingly restricts the dissemination of information or intentionally provides incorrect information on programs and services regarding reproductive health, though the said acts are based on his/her conscientious objections, would still be liable under Section 23(a)(1).<br><br>Section 23(a)(1) recognizes the primacy of the right of an individual to be informed and, accordingly, exercise his/her right to choose and make decisions on matters affecting his/her reproductive health.

The Constitution provides that a public office is a public trust.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> An important characteristic of a public office is that its creation and conferment involves a delegation to the individual of some of the sovereign functions of government, to be exercised by him for the benefit of the public; that some portion of the sovereignty of the country, either legislative, executive, or judicial, attaches, for the time being, to be exercised for the public benefit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>That a public officer is specifically delegated with the a sovereign function of the government, i.e. the implementation of the provisions of RA 10354 and its IRR, is what sets him apart from a health care service provider under Section 23(a)(3). It should be clarified, however, that the religious accommodation extended to conscientious objectors under Section 23(a)(3) covers public health care service providers, who are likewise considered public officers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> However, unlike the public officers under Section 23(b) and Section 5.24 of the IRR, public health care service providers under Section 23(a)(3) are not specifically charged with the implementation of the provisions of R.A.

No. 10354 is to provide an increased access to information, programs, and services regarding reproductive health. Allowing the same religious accommodation extended under Section 23(a)(3) to public officers charged with the implementation of the law would seriously hamper the delivery of the various programs and services regarding reproductive health under R.A. No. 10354. In this regard, a public officer specifically charged with the implementation of the provisions of R.A.

Also, the prohibition imposed under Section 23(b) and Section 5.24 of the IRR applies equally to all public officers specifically charged with the implementation of the law.

Indeed, it is undeniable that a man does not shed his spirituality once he assumes public office. However, it cannot equally be denied that the State, in the pursuit of its legitimate secular objectives, should not be unnecessarily impeded by the religious scruples of its agents.

However, in such cases, the health care service provider would still have the duty to immediately refer the married individual or the abused minor to another health care service provider within the same facility or one, which is conveniently accessible.<br><br><b>Section 23(a)(2)(i) merely upholds<br> the primacy of an individual's choice <br>on matters affecting his/her health;<br> it does not intrude into the right to<br> marital privacy.</b><br><br>Essentially, Section 23(a)(2)(i)<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[77]</sup></font> provides that a married individual may undergo a reproductive health procedure sans the consent/authorization of his/her spouse; that any health care service provider who would obstinately refuse to perform such procedure on a married individual on the pretext of the lack of spousal consent would be penalized accordingly.<br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> declared Section 23(a)(2)(i) as being contrary to Section 3, Article XV of the Constitution, which requires the State to defend the "right of the spouses to found a family," thus unduly infringing on the right to marital privacy. The <i>ponencia</i> explained that the said provision "refers to reproductive health procedures like tubal ligation and vasectomy which, by their very nature, require mutual consent and decision between the husband and wife as they affect issues intimately related to the founding of the family." The <i>ponencia</i> pointed out that decision-making concerning reproductive health procedure "falls within the protected zone of marital privacy" from which State intrusion is proscribed. Thus, the ponencia concluded, dispensing with the spousal consent is "disruptive of family unity" and "a marked departure from the policy of the State to protect marriage as an inviolable social institution."<br><br>It is conceded that intimate relations between husband and wife fall within the right of privacy formed by emanations of the various guarantees in the Bill ofRights, to which State intrusion is proscribed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> However, I do not agree that upholding a married individual's choice to submit to reproductive health procedure despite the absence of the consent or authorization of his/her spouse would be disruptive of the family.<br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> harps on the right to privacy that inheres in marital relationships. Yet the marital couple is not an independent entity, with a mind and heart of its own, but an association of two individuals, each with a separate intellectual and emotional makeup.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> While the law affirms that the right of privacy inheres in marital relationships, it likewise recognizes that a spouse, as an individual per se, equally has personal autonomy and privacy rights apart from the right to marital privacy guaranteed by the Constitution. <b>A spouse's personal autonomy and privacy rights</b>, as an individual<i> per se, </i>among others, necessitates that his/her decision on matters affecting his/her health, including reproductive health, be respected and given preference.<br><br>At the heart of Section 23(a)(2)(i) is the fundamental liberty of an individual to personal autonomy,<i> i.e.</i>, to decide on matters affecting his/her reproductive health. Section 23(a)(2)(i), contrary to the ponencia 's insinuation, does not hinder a married individual from conferring with his/her spouse on his/her intended reproductive health procedure. There is nothing in the said provision, which prevents a husband/wife from obtaining the consent/authorization for an intended reproductive health procedure. Nevertheless, the objection of the other spouse thereto, as common sense would suggest, should not prevent a married individual from proceeding with the reproductive health procedure since it is his/her bodily integrity that is at stake.<br><br>In this regard, the ruling of the US Supreme Court <i>Planned Parenthood v. Danforth</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> is instructive. <i>Danforth </i>involves a Missouri abortion statute, which, <i>inter alia</i>, required the written consent of the husband before a woman may be allowed to submit to an abortion<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[81]</sup></font> during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. The US Supreme Court declared the spousal consent requirement unconstitutional for unduly intruding into the right to privacy of the woman. Thus:<br><br><blockquote>We now hold that the State may not constitutionally require the consent of the spouse, as is specified under § 3(3) of the Missouri Act, as a condition for abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. We thus agree with the dissenting judge in the present case, and with the courts whose decisions are cited above, that <b>the State cannot delegate to a spouse a veto power which the state itself is absolutely and totally prohibited from exercising</b> during the first trimester of pregnancy.<br><br>x x x Clearly, since the State cannot regulate or proscribe abortion during the first stage, when the physician and his patient make that decision, the State cannot delegate authority to any particular person, even the spouse, to prevent abortion during that same period.<br><br>We are not unaware of the deep and proper concern and interest that a devoted and protective husband has in his wife's pregnancy and in the growth and development of the fetus she is carrying. Neither has this Court failed to appreciate the importance of the marital relationship in our society. x x x Moreover, we recognize that the decision whether to undergo or to forgo an abortion may have profound effects on the future of any marriage, effects that are both physical and mental, and possibly deleterious. <b>Notwithstanding these factors, we cannot hold that the State has the constitutional authority to give the spouse unilaterally the ability to prohibit the wife from terminating her pregnancy when the State itself lacks that right</b>.x x x.<br><br><b>It seems manifest that, ideally, the decision to terminate a pregnancy should be one concurred in by both the wife and her husband. No marriage may be viewed as harmonious or successful if the marriage partners are fundamentally divided on so important and vital an issue. But it is difficult to believe that the goal of fostering mutuality and trust in a marriage, and of strengthening the marital relationship and the marriage institution, will be achieved by giving the husband a veto power exercisable for any reason whatsoever or for no reason at all</b>. Even if the State had the ability to delegate to the husband a power it itself could not exercise, it is not at all likely that such action would further, as the District Court majority phrased it, the "interest of the state in protecting the mutuality of decisions vital to the marriage relationship."<br><br>xxxx<br><br>We recognize, of course, that, when a woman, with the approval of her physician but without the approval of her husband, decides to terminate her pregnancy, it could be said that she is acting unilaterally. <b>The obvious fact is that, when the wife and the husband disagree on this decision, the view of only one of the two marriage partners can prevail. Inasmuch as it is the woman who physically bears the child and who is the more directly and immediately affected by the pregnancy, as between the two, the balance weighs in her favor.</b> x x x.<br><br>(Emphases ours)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup></blockquote><br>It is indeed ideal that the decision whether to submit to reproductive health procedure be a joint undertaking of the spouses, especially on such a vital and sensitive matter. It is inevitable, however, for cases to abound wherein a husband/wife would object to the intended procedure of his/her spouse. In such cases, the right to reproductive health of a spouse would be rendered effectively inutile. I do not see how fostering such stalemate, which can hardly be considered as a harmonious and blissful marital relationship, could "protect the marriage as an inviolable social institution."<br><br>Thus, the law, in case of disagreement, recognizes that the decision of the spouse undergoing the reproductive health procedure should prevail. In so declaring, Section 23(a)(2)(i) does not invidiously interfere with the privacy rights of the spouses. In dispensing with the spousal consent/authorization in case of disagreement, the law is not declaring a substantive right for the first time; even in the absence of such declaration, the decision of the spouse undergoing the reproductive health procedure would still prevail. Section 23(a)(2)(i) is but a mere recognition and affirmation of a married individual's constitutionally guaranteed personal autonomy and his/her right to reproductive health.<br><br><b>Requiring the rendition of <i>pro bono</i><br>reproductive health services to indigent women<br>for PhilHealth accreditation does not infringe on<br>religious freedom.</b><br><br>Section 17 encourages private and non-government reproductive health care service providers "to provide at least forty-eight (48) hours annually of reproductive health services, ranging from providing information and education to rendering medical services, free of charge to indigent and low-income patients." It further mandated that the <i>pro bono</i> reproductive health services shall be included as a prerequisite in the accreditation under the PhilHealth.<br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> declared that Section 17, contrary to the petitioners' stance, does not amount to involuntary servitude; that it merely encourages reproductive health care service providers to render <i>pro bono</i> services. The ponencia likewise held that requiring the rendition of said <i>pro bono</i> services for PhilHealth accreditation is not an unreasonable burden, but a necessary incentive imposed by Congress in the furtherance of a legitimate State interest. Nevertheless, the <i>ponencia</i> declared Section 17 unconstitutional insofar as it affects conscientious objectors in securing PhilHealth accreditation; that conscientious objectors are exempt from rendition of reproductive health services, <i>pro bono</i> or otherwise.<br><br>While I agree with the <i>ponencia </i>that Section 17 does not amount to involuntary servitude and that requiring the rendition of <i>pro bono</i> reproductive health services for PhilHealth accreditation is not an unreasonable burden to health care service providers, I disagree that Section 17 is unconstitutional as applied to conscientious objectors.<br><br>As pointed out earlier, it is conceded that health care service providers may not be compelled to provide certain information or service regarding reproductive health if it would be anathema to his/her religious convictions. Specifically, under Section 17, a health care service provider may not be denied the opportunity to be accredited under R.A. No. 7875, otherwise known as the National Health Insurance Act of 1995, as amended by R.A. No. 10606, for his/her refusal to render <i>pro bono</i> reproductive health services <b>that are contrary to his/her religious beliefs.</b><br><br>However, that a health care service provider has religious objections to <b>certain reproductive health care services</b> does not mean that he/she is already exempted from the requirement under Section 17 for PhilHealth accreditation. The requirement under Section 17 is stated in general terms and is religion-neutral; it merely states that health care service providers, as a condition for PhilHealth accreditation, must render <i>pro bono</i> reproductive health service. The phrase "reproductive health care service" is quite expansive and is not limited only to those services, which may be deemed objectionable based on religious beliefs.<br><br>Reproductive health care includes: (1) family planning information and services; (2) maternal, infant and child health and nutrition, including breastfeeding; (3) proscription of abortion and management of abortion complications; (4) adolescent and youth reproductive health guidance and counseling; (5) prevention, treatment, and management of reproductive tract infections, HIV and AIDS, and other sexually transmittable infections; (6) elimination of violence against women and children, and other forms of sexual and gender-based violence; (7) education and counseling on sexuality and reproductive health; (8) treatment of breast and reproductive tract cancers, and other gynecological conditions and disorders; (9) male responsibility and involvement, and men's reproductive health; (10) prevention, treatment, and management of infertility and sexual dysfunction; (11) reproductive health education for adolescents; and (12) mental health aspect of reproductive health care.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>Thus, a health care service provider, his/her religious objections to certain reproductive health care services aside, may still render <i>pro bono</i> reproductive health care service, as a prerequisite for PhilHealth accreditation, by providing information or medical services, for instance, on treatment of breast and reproductive tract cancers, and other gynecological conditions and disorders or on maternal, infant and child health and nutrition.<br><br><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, I vote to <b>DECLARE UNCONSTITUTIONAL only</b> Section 7 of Republic Act No. 10354, insofar as it dispenses with the requirement of parental consent for minors who are already parents or have had a miscarriage, for being contrary to Section 12, Article II of the Constitution.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Section 9. <i>The Philippine National Drug Formulary System and Family Planning Supplies.</i> - The National Drug Formulary shall include hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine devices, injectables and other safe, legal, non-abortifacient and effective family planning products and supplies.

The solution to social disagreement ought to be achieved only through legislative process, and not through this Court. Time and again, it has been enunciated that "[t]he judiciary does not pass upon questions of wisdom, justice or expediency of legislation. More than that, courts accord the presumption of constitutionality to legislative enactments, not only because the legislature is presumed to abide by the Constitution but also because the judiciary in the determination of actual cases and controversies must reflect the wisdom and justice of the people as expressed through their representatives in the executive and legislative departments of the government."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Consequently, as an overriding principle of judicial review, courts are bound to adopt an attitude of liberality in favor of sustaining a statute.

Absent a proper presentation of established scientific facts which becomes more realizable today due to the advances in medicine and technology, the <i>ponencia</i>, by mere reference to the exchanges of the Framers during the constitutional deliberations, treads on dangerous territory by making a final adjudication on this issue. Section 12,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Article II of the 1987 Philippine Constitution is not a definitive guidepost to the question on when does life begin, but rather a declaration of the State's policy to equally protect the life of the mother and the life of the unborn from conception, to which the objectives and provisions of the RH Law, to my mind, remain consistent and faithful to.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>That being said, I proceed to briefly explain the reasons behind my other points of dissent.<br><br><b>I.<u> The Duty to Refer, Perform, and Inform<br><i>vis-a-vis</i> Conscientious Objection</u>.</b><br><br>Utilizing the parameters of strict scrutiny in accord with the doctrine of benevolent neutrality, the<i> ponencia</i> finds <b>Section 7</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> of the RH Law and its corresponding provision in the RH-IRR unconstitutional insofar as they require private health facilities and non-maternity specialty hospitals and hospitals owned and operated by a religious group to immediately <b>refer</b> patients not in an emergency or life-threatening case, as defined under the RH Law, to another health facility which is conveniently accessible.<br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> further relates<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Section 7 to <b>Sections 23(a)(1)</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> and <b>23(a)(2)</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> of the RH Law, as well as their counterpart RH-IRR provisions, particularly Section 5.24 thereof, insofar as they, as to the first provision stated, punish any health care service provider who fails and or refuses<b> to disseminate information </b>regarding programs and services on reproductive health (supposedly) regardless of his or her religious beliefs, and insofar as they, as to the second provision stated, punish any health care service provider who refuses <b>to perform</b> reproductive health procedures on account of their religious beliefs. Stating jurisprudential precepts on the Free Exercise Clause, the <i>ponencia </i>applies its religious freedom take on Section 7 to Sections 23(a)(1) and 23(a)(2) of the RH Law, "considering that in the dissemination of information regarding programs and services and in the performance of reproductive health procedures the religious freedom of health care service providers should be respected."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Equally treated as unconstitutional is <b>Section 23(a)(3)</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> and its corresponding provision in the RH-IRR, particularly <b>Section 5.24</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> thereof, insofar as they punish any health care service provider who fails and/or refuses to refer a patient not in an emergency or life-threatening case as defined under Republic Act No. 8344, to another health care service provider within the same facility or one which is conveniently accessible regardless of his or her religious beliefs.<br><br>I disagree.<br><br>Under the benevolent-neutrality theory utilized by the <i>ponencia</i> in support of its position, religious freedom is seen as a substantive right and not merely a privilege against discriminatory legislation. With religion looked upon with benevolence and not hostility, benevolent neutrality allows accommodation of religion under certain circumstances. As case law instructs, it is the strict scrutiny-compelling state interest test which is most in line with the benevolent neutrality-accommodation approach.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> This method of analysis operates under three (3) parameters, namely: (<i>a</i>) the sincerity of the religious belief which is burdened by a statute or a government action; (<i>b</i>) the existence of a compelling state interest which justifies such burden on the free exercise of religion; and (<i>c</i>) in the furtherance of its legitimate state objective, the state has employed the least intrusive means to such exercise of religious beliefs.<br><br>There is no striking objection to the concurrence of the first parameter given that the burden of proving the same lies on the person asserting a religious freedom violation, as petitioners in these consolidated cases.<br><br>As to the second parameter, the <i>ponencia</i> misplaces its conclusion that there exists no compelling state interest to justify the burden of the conscientious objector's duty to refer on statistical data showing that the maternal mortality rate had actually dropped even before the enactment of the RH Law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> What seems to be lost in the equation is the substantive value advanced by the legislative policy, namely, the right to health, an inextricable adjunct of one's right to life, which is sought to be protected by increasing the public's awareness of reproductive health options. Notwithstanding the premise that maternal deaths have substantially decreased during the last two (2) decades, it cannot be seriously doubted that the State has a compelling interest to protect its citizen's right to health and life. The denial (or the threat of denial) of these rights even only against one, to my mind, is enough to conclude that the second parameter of scrutiny has been passed.<br><br>With respect to the third parameter, the <i>ponencia</i> submits that the State has not used the least intrusive means in advancing its interest by imposing the duty to refer on health care service providers who are conscientious objectors since they cannot be compelled, "in conscience, (to) do indirectly what they cannot do directly."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> But again, what is apparently discounted is the inherent professional responsibility of health care service providers to apprise patients of their available options concerning reproductive health. Health care service providers cannot - as they should not - absolutely keep mum on objective data on reproductive health, lest they deprive their patients of sound professional advice or deny them the right to make informed choices regarding their own reproductive health. Religious beliefs may exempt the conscientious objector from directly performing the act objected to, but the least intrusive means, in this scenario, is to impose upon them, at the very least, the duty to refer the patient to another health care service provider within the same facility or one which is conveniently accessible to the end of realizing the patient's health choice. After all, nothing in the assailed provisions on the duty to refer prevents the conscientious objector from sharing his or her religious beliefs on the reproductive health method the patient is informed of.&nbsp; The conscientious objector can preach on his or her religious beliefs notwithstanding the secular command of sharing objective info ation on reproductive health methods or referring the patient to another health care service provider who may possibly subscribe to a different belief. I also see no burden on the conscience through what the <i>ponencia</i> dubs as indirect complicity. I believe that when the health care service provider refers the patient to another, the former, in fact, manifests his or her conviction against the objected method. Thus, the argument can be made that the act of referral is in itself the objection. Inviolability of conscience should not be used as a<i> carte blanche</i> excuse to escape the strong arm of the law and its legitimate objectives. Our liberties may flourish within reasonable limitations.<br><br>Neither do I find Section 23(a)(l) of the RH Law, as well as its RH­ IRR provision counterpart, invidious of religious freedom, particularly, of the Free Exercise Clause, for the reason that information dissemination on health advice, including that on reproductive health, constitutes, as mentioned, an inherent professional responsibility of health care service providers to their patients. Informing the patient of his or her health options does not, in any way, preclude the conscientious objector from, as also earlier stated, sharing his or her religious beliefs on the matter. After disseminating the information, and when the·patient affirmatively decides to take the reproductive health procedure, then the conscientious objector may opt not to perform such procedure himself or. herself and, instead, refer the patient to another health care service provider based only on the qualification of accessibility; nothing in the law requires the conscientious objector to refer the patient to a health care service provider capable and willing to perform the reproductive health procedure objected to.<br><br>In the same light, I find Section 23(a)(2) clear from any religious freedom infraction for the reason that conscientious objectors are given the choice not to perform reproductive health procedures on account of their religious beliefs, albeit they are dutifully required to refer their patients to another health care service provider within the same facility or one which is conveniently accessible to the end of realizing the patient's health choice. The same reasons stated in my previous discussions equally obtain in this respect. Accordingly, I submit that the RH Law and the RH-IRR provisions governing the conscientious objector's duty to refer and its correlative prov1S1ons on information dissemination and performance be upheld as constitutional.<br><br><b>II. <u>Section 23(b) of tbe RH Law in relation to<br>Section 5.24 of tbe RH-IRR <i>vis-a-vis</i><br>tbe Conscientious Objector Exception.</u></b><br><br>Section 23(b) of the RH Law provides a general proscription on non­ performance, restriction, and/or hindrance of delivering reproductive health care services against a public officer specifically charged with the implementation of the RH Law, <i>viz</i>.:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 23. <i>Prohibited Acts.</i>- The following acts are prohibited:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(b) Any public officer, elected or appointed, specifically charged with the duty to implement the provisions hereof, who, personally or through a subordinate, prohibits or restricts the delivery of legal and medically-safe reproductive health care services, including family planning; or forces, coerces or induces any person to use such services; or refuses to allocate, approve or release any budget for reproductive health care services, or to support reproductive health programs; or shall do any act that hinders the full implementation of a reproductive health program as mandated by this Act;<br><br>x x x x</blockquote><br>Nothing in the provision's text or any provision of the entire RH Law negates the availability of the conscientious objector exception to the public officers above-described.<br><br>This notwithstanding, <b>Section 5.24 of the RH-IRR</b> states that skilled health professionals such as provincial, city, or municipal health officers, chiefs of hospital, head nurses, supervising midwives, among others, who by virtue of their office are specifically charged with the duty to implement the provisions of the RH Law <b>cannot be deemed as conscientious objectors</b>,<i> viz</i>.:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 5.24 <i>Public Skilled Health Professional as a Conscientious Objector.</i> In order to legally refuse to deliver reproductive health care services or information as a conscientious objector, a public skilled health professional shall comply with the following requirements:<br><br><blockquote>a) The skilled health professional shall explain to the client the limited range of services he/she can provide;<br><br>b) Extraordinary diligence shall be exerted to refer the client seeking care to another skilled health professional or volunteer willing and capable of delivering the desired reproductive health care service within the same facility;<br><br>c) If within the same health facility, there is no other skilled health professional or volunteer willing and capable of delivering the desired reproductive health care service, the conscientious objector shall refer the client to another specific health facility or provider that is conveniently accessible in consideration of the client's travel arrangements and financial capacity;<br><br>d) Written documentation of compliance with the preceding requirements; and<br><br>e) Other requirements as determined by the DOH.</blockquote><br>In the event where the public skilled health professional cannot comply with all of the above requirements, he or she shall deliver the client's desired reproductive health care service or information without further delay.<br><br><b><i>Provided,</i> That skilled health professionals such as provincial, city, or municipal health officers, chiefs of hospital, head nurses, supervising midwives, among others, who by virtue of their office are specifically charged with the duty to implement the provisions of the RPRH Act and these Rules, cannot be considered as conscientious objectors.</b><br><br>Within sixty (60) days from the effectivity ofthese rules, the DOH shall develop guidelines for the implementation of this provision. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The<i> ponencia </i> declared&nbsp; Section 5.24 of the RH-IRR as unconstitutional for being discriminatory and violative of the equal protection clause. It held that there is no perceptible distinction between skilled health professionals who by virtue of their office are specifically charged with the duty to implement the provisions of the RH Law and other public health care service providers so as to preclude the former from availing of the conscientious objector exemption, considering that they are also accorded the right to the free exercise of religion. It opined that "the freedom to believe is intrinsic in every individual and the protective robe that guarantees its free exercise is not taken off even if one acquires employment in the government."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>I concur with tbe<i> ponencia </i>only in striking down Section 5.24 of the RH-IRR but dissent against its undertaking of an equal protection analysis.<br><br>As I see it, the problem lies only with Section 5.24 of the RH-IRR <b>going beyond</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> what is provided for in the RH Law. Section 5.24 of tbe RH-IRR is an erroneous construction of Section 23(b) of the RH Law which must stand as constitutional. As earlier mentioned, the latter provision only states general prohibitions to public officers specifically charged with the implementation of the RH Law; nothing in its text negates the availability of the conscientious objector exception to them, or to "skilled health professionals such as provincial, city, or municipal health officers, chiefs of hospital, head nurses, supervising midwives, among others, who by virtue of their office are specifically charged with the duty to implement the provisions of the [RH Law and the RH-IRR]." Section 23(b) of the RH Law must be construed in the context of its surrounding provisions which afford the conscientious objector the ability to opt-out from performing reproductive health practices on account of his or her religious beliefs. As the aforementioned RH-IRR provision would be stricken down as invalid on <i>ultra vires</i> grounds, I believe that an equal protection analysis is unnecessary.<br><br><b>III. <u>Minority Exceptions to Parental Consent</u>.</b><br><br>The <i>ponencia </i>also holds Section 7<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> and its corresponding RH-IRR provision unconstitutional insofar as they allow minor-parents or minors who have suffered a miscarriage access to modern methods of family planning without written consent from their parents or guardianls. The <i>ponencia</i> deemed this as a premature severing of the parents' parental authority over their children even if she is not yet emancipated, and thus, declared unconstitutional as well.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Again, I disagree.<br><br>The provision only states that minor children who are already parents or have had a miscarriage are entitled to information and access to modern day methods of family planning without the. need of their parents' consent. There is nothing in the RH Law which forecloses the exercise of parental authority. Parents may still determine if modern day family planning methods are beneficial to the physical well-being of their child, who is a minor-parent or a minor who has suffered a miscarriage. The RH Law provision should be read complementarily with Articles 209 and 220 of the Family Code of the Philippines<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> which state that:<br><br><blockquote>Art. 209. Pursuant to the natural right and duty of parents over the person and property of their unemancipated children, <b>parental authority and responsibility shall include the caring for and rearing them for civic consciousness and efficiency and the <u>development</u> of their moral, mental and <u>physical character and well-being.</u></b><br><br>Art. 220. The parents and those exercising parental authority shall have with the respect to their unemancipated children or wards the following rights and duties:<br><br>xxxx<br><br>(4) To furnish them with good and wholeome educational materials, supervise their activities, recreation and association with others, protect them from bad company, <b>and prevent them from acquiring habits detrimental to their <u>health</u>, studies and morals</b>; (Emphases and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>The RH Law provision on parental consent does not amount to a negation or even a dilution of the parent's right to care for and rear their minor child who is already a parent or has undergone an abortion towards the end of developing her physical character and well-being. Neither does the provision inhibit the minor's parents from preventing their child from acquiring detrimental health habits. Recognizing that these minors have distinct reproductive health needs due to their existing situation, the law simply does away with the necessity of presenting to reproductive health care service providers prior parental consent before they are given information and access to modem day methods of family planning. In a predominantly conservative culture like ours, wherein the thought that pre­marital sex is taboo pervades, a minor who is already a parent or one who has undergone a previous miscarriage is, more often than not, subject to some kind of social stigma. Said minor, given her predisposition when viewed against social perception, may find it difficult, or rather uncomfortable, to approach her parents on the sensitive subject of reproductive health, and, much more, to procure their consent. The RH Law does away with this complication and makes modem methods of family planning easily accessible to the minor, all in the interest of her health and physical well-being. On all accounts, nothing stops the minor's parents to, in the exercise of their parental authority, intervene, having in mind the best interest of their child insofar as her health and physical well-being are concerned.<br><br>Besides, in addition to its limited availability to a distinct class of minors,<i> i.e.</i>, minor children who are already parents or have had a miscarriage, the provision only dispenses wi_th the need for prior parental consent in reference to mere information dissemination and access to modem day methods of family planning. When the minor elects to undergo the required surgical procedure, the law makes it clear that the need for prior parental consent is preserved, but, understandably, in no case shall consent be required in emergency or serious cases. <b>Section 23(a)(2)(ii)</b> of the RH Law states this rule:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 23. <i>Prohibited Acts.</i>- The following acts are prohibited:<br><br>(a) Any health care service provider, whether public or private, who shall:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(2) Refuse to perform legal and medically-safe reproductive health procedures on any person of legal age on the ground of lack of consent or authorization of the following persons in the following instances:<br><br>xxxx<br><br>(ii) Parental consent or that of the person exerctsmg parental authority in the case of abused minors, where the parent or the person exercising parental authority is the respondent, accused or convicted perpetrator as certified by the proper prosecutorial office of the court. <b>In the case of minors, the written consent of parents or legal guardian or, in their absence, persons exercising parental authority or next-of-kin shall be required only in elective surgical procedures and in no case shall consent be required in emergency or serious cases as defined in Republic Act No. 8344</b>; and<br><br>x x x x (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><b>IV. <u>Spousal Consent</u>.</b><br><br><b>Section 23(a)(2)(i)</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> of the RH Law provides that spousal consent is needed before a married person may undergo certain reproductive health procedures, such as vasectomy for males and tubal ligation for females, provided, that in case of disagreement, it is the decision of the one undergoing the procedure which shall prevail.<br><br>In declaring this provision as unconstitutional, the <i>ponencia</i> explained that since a decision to undergo a reproductive health procedure principally affects the right to found a family, such decision should not be left solely to the one undergoing the procedure, but rather, should be made and shared by both spouses as one cohesive unit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>I would, once more, have to disagree with the <i>ponencia</i>.<br><br>There is nothing in the RH Law that would completely alienate the other spouse in the decision-making process nor obviate any real dialogue between them. This is a purely private affair left for the spouses to experience for themselves. Ideally and as much as possible, spouses should, as the <i>ponencia</i> puts it, act as "one cohesive unit" in the decision-making process in undergoing a reproductive health procedure. However, when there is a complete disagreement between the spouses, the assailed RH Law provision provides, by way of exception, a deadlock-mechanism whereby the decision of the one undergoing the procedure shall prevail if only to prevent any unsettling conflict between the married couple on the issue. To add, the assailed provision, in my view, also provides a practical solution to situations of estrangement which complicates the process of procuring the other spouse's consent.<br><br>Verily, on matters involving medical procedures, it cannot be seriously doubted that the choice of the person undergoing the procedure is of paramount importance precisely because it is his or her right to health, as an inextricable adjunct of his or her right to life, which remains at stake. The right to individual choice is the main thrust of the doctrine of personal autonomy and self-determination which provides that "[n]o right is held more sacred, or is more carefully guarded, by the common law, than the right of every individual to the possession and control of his own person, free from all restraint or interference of others, unless by clear and unquestionable authority of law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Under this doctrine, a competent adult has the right to refuse medical treatment, even treatment necessary to sustain life;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> all the more, should the adult have the right to, on the flip side, avail of medical treatment necessary to sustain his or her life. Aptly citing American jurisprudence, Chief Justice Maria Lourdes P. A. Sereno, in her opinion, enunciates that "every human being of adult years and sound mind has a right to determine what shall be done with his own body."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> I share this sentiment.<br><br>In the final analysis, the constitutional right to found a family should not be shallowly premised on the mere decision on the number of children; the right to found a family, more importantly, looks towards the well-being of its members, such as the reproductive health of the spouse undergoing the disputed procedure. To this end, the decision of said family member should be respected and not be overruled by either his/her spouse or by the courts. Respect for individual autonomy, especially in cases involving the individual 's physical well-being, is a reasonable limitation and, even, a corollary to the spouses' collective right to found a family.<br><br><b>V. <u><i>Pro Bono</i> Services as Pre-requisite <br>for PhiiHealth Accreditation</u>.</b><br><br><b>Section 17</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> of the RH Law provides that public and private healthcare service providers are encouraged to provide at least 48 hours of<i> pro bono</i> reproductive health services annually, ranging from providing information and education to rendering medical services.

The people who, through their elected representatives in Congress, have given the RH Law their stamp of approval, I believe, do not cherish these values any less. It is by trusting that we all share a common respect for the core values that we can all afford the RH Law a chance to foster its legitimate objectives. There is no question that we, by the blessings of democracy, all have the right to differ on how we chart our nation's destiny. But the exercise of one's freedoms must always come with the recognition of another's. We have built our political institutions not only as a venue for liberty to thrive, but also as a unifying space to reconcile disparity in thought.&nbsp; While we may have now reached a verdict on the path to take on the issue of reproductive health, let us not forget that, in the fire of free exchange, the process is a continuous one: we are all contributors to constant refinement; nothing precludes us from positive change.

The Court has already made pronouncements on the constitutionality of the other provisions of R.A.

There is thus no reason for the Court to avoid a definitive ruling on the constitutionality of Section 14.

The provision mandates that no person shall be denied information and access to family planning services, whether natural or artificial. However, the last <i>proviso</i> of Section 7 restricts the access of minors to modem methods of family planning; it requires a written parental consent before a minor may be allowed access thereto. This is but recognition of the parental authority that is exercised by parents over the persons of their unemancipated children.

There is no cogent reason to require a written parental consent for a minor who seeks access to modem family planning methods and dispense with such requirement if the minor is already a parent or has had a miscarriage. Under the Family Code, all minors, generally, regardless of his/her circumstances, are still covered by the parental authority exercised by their parents. That a minor is already a parent or has had a miscarriage does not operate to divest his/her parents of their parental authority; such circumstances do not emancipate a minor.<br><br>It is cardinal with us that the custody, care and nurture of the child reside first in the parents, whose primary function and freedom include preparation for obligations the State can neither supply nor hinder.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Most children, even in adolescence, simply are not able to make sound judgments concerning many decisions, including their need for medical care or treatment.

Section 5(2), Article XIV of the Constitution guarantees all institutions of higher learning academic freedom. The institutional academic freedom includes the right of the school or college to decide and adopt its aims and objectives, and to determine how these objections can best be attained, free from outside coercion or interference, save possibly when the overriding public welfare calls for some restraint. The essential freedoms subsumed in the term "academic freedom" encompass the freedom of the school or college to determine for itself: (1) who may teach; (2) what may be taught; (3) how lessons shall be taught; and (4) who may be admitted to study.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>An analysis of the foregoing claim requires a dichotomy between public and private educational institutions. The last sentence of Section 14 provides that the age- and development-appropriate reproductive health curriculum that would be formulated by the DepEd "shall be used by public schools and <b>may be adopted</b> by private schools." The mandated reproductive health education would only be compulsory for public schools. Thus, as regards private educational institutions, there being no compulsion, their constitutional right to academic freedom is not thereby violated.<br><br>As regards public educational institutions, though they are mandatorily required to adopt an age- and development-appropriate reproductive health education curriculum, the claimed curtailment of academic freedom is still untenable. Section 4(1), Article XIV of the Constitution provides that "[t]he State x x x shall exercise reasonable supervision and regulation of all educational institutions." The constitutional grant of academic freedom does not withdraw from the State the power to supervise and regulate educational institutions, whether public or private. The only requirement imposed by the Constitution on the State's supervision and regulation of educational institutions is that the exercise thereof must be reasonable.<br><br>Congress deemed it appropriate to include a provision on age- and development-appropriate reproductive health education as a means to address the rise of teenage pregnancies.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> In a 2002 survey conducted by the University of the Philippines Population Institute, it was shown that 23% of young people aged 15 to 24 years old had already engaged in pre-marital sex; that pre-marital sex was prevalent among 31.1% of the boys and 15.4°/o among the girls.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> The survey, after a consideration of other factors, concluded that many young people, despite having inadequate knowledge on reproductive health problems, engage in risky sexual behavior.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> That, despite having liberal views on sex and related matters, they rarely seek medical help for reproductive health problems.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Poignantly, given this factual milieu, the provision on age- and development-appropriate reproductive health education under Section 14 is reasonable.<br><br>The importance of integrating the subject of the dangers and dire consequences of alcohol abuse or even the menace of dangerous drugs in the curricula of primary and secondary educational institutions cannot be disputed.

The petitioners claim that parents have the primary duty to educate their children, especially on matters affecting reproductive health.

The standard to be used in determining the validity of a government regulation, which is claimed to infringe the right to privacy of the people, was explained by the United States (US) Supreme Court in the land mark case of <i>Griswold v.

In this sense, Section 14, in taking into account the relevant concerns of parents and other interest groups in the formulation of the curriculum, has been narrowly tailored so as not to invade the right to privacy of the parents.<br><br>Equally untenable is the petitioners' claim that the provision of age­ and development-appropriate reproductive health education under Section 14 unduly burdens their freedom of religion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> A similar claim was resolved by the <i>Supreme Court of Hawaii in Medeiros v.

It thus mandates all accredited public health facilities to provide a full range of modem family planning methods, which includes medical consultations, supplies and procedures. Private health facilities are likewise required to extend family planning services to paying patients.<br><br>On the other hand, Section 23(a)(3) penalizes the refusal of any health care service provider to extend quality reproductive health care services and information on account of the patient's marital status, gender, age, religious convictions, personal circumstances, or nature of work. Thus:<br><br><blockquote>Section 23.<i> Prohibited Acts.</i>- The following acts are prohibited:<br><br>(a) Any health care service provider, whether public or private, who shall:<br><br><blockquote>xxxx<br><br>(3) Refuse to extend quality health care services and information on account of the person's marital status, gender, age, religious convictions, personal circumstances, or nature of work: <i><b>Provided</b></i><b>, That the conscientious objection of a health care service provider based on his/her ethical or religious beliefs shall be respected; however, the conscientious objector shall immediately refer the person seeking such care and services to another health care service provider within the same facility or one which is conveniently accessible:</b> <i>Provided, further,</i> That the person is not in an emergency condition or serious case as defined in Republic Act No. 8344, which penalizes the refusal of hospitals and medical clinics to administer appropriate initial medical treatment and support in emergency and serious cases;<br><br>x x x x (Emphasis ours)</blockquote></blockquote><br><br>Nevertheless, although Section 7 provides "that family planning services shall likewise be extended by private health facilities to paying patients," it nevertheless exempts "non-maternity specialty hospitals and<b> hospitals owned and operated by a religious group</b>" from providing full range of modem family planning methods. Instead, Section 7 imposes on non-maternity specialty hospitals and hospitals owned and operated by a religious group the duty to immediately refer patients seeking reproductive health care and services to another health facility that is conveniently accessible.<br><br>In the same manner, the prohibition imposed under Section 23(a)(3) is not absolute; it recognizes that a health care service provider may validly refuse to render reproductive health services and information if he/she conscientiously objects thereto ''based on his/her ethical or religious beliefs." Nevertheless, Section 23(a)(3) likewise imposes a corresponding duty on such conscientious objector to immediately refer the person seeking reproductive health services to another health care service provider within the same facility or one, which is conveniently accessible.<br><br>It cannot be denied that the State has a legitimate interest in the promotion and protection of the right to reproductive health of the people. The question that has to be resolved then is whether such interest can be considered compelling as to justify any incidental burden on the free exercise of religion.<br><br>The determination of whether there exists a compelling state interest that would justify an incidental burden involves balancing the interest of the State against religious liberty to determine which is more compelling under the particular set of facts.

It is quite unfortunate that the country has a high rate of maternal and infant deaths, when it can be significantly reduced with proper and effective reproductive health care.<br><br>No less distressing is the state of unintended pregnancies, and its equally harrowing consequences, in the country. According to a study prepared by the Alan Guttmacher Institute (AGI), there were 1.9 million unintended pregnancies in the Philippines in 2008, resulting in two main outcomes-unplanned births and unsafe abortions. In the Philippines, 37% of all births are either not wanted at the time of pregnancy (mistimed) or entirely unwanted, and 54% of all pregnancies are unintended. The AGI further discovered that, on average, Filipino women give birth to more children than they want, which is particularly striking among the poorest Filipino women, who have nearly two children more than they intend to have.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>The AGI stressed that the foregoing statistics can be attributed to low contraceptive use and high levels of unmet need for contraception. The AGI pointed out that in 2008, more than 90% of unintended pregnancies occurred among women using traditional, ineffective methods or no method at all. The study further showed that poor women are less likely to use a contraceptive method than non-poor women (43% vs. 51%), and in regions where poverty is common, contraceptive use is substantially lower than the national average--<i>e.g</i>., 38% in the Zamboanga Peninsula and 24% in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>The present condition of the country's reproductive health care, taken together with the Constitution's mandate to promote and protect the right to health of the people, constitutes a compelling state interest as would justify an incidental burden on the religious freedom of conscientious objectors. Sections 7 and 23(a)(3) of R.A. No. 10354 were crafted to ensure that the government's effort in disseminating information and providing access to services and programs on reproductive health would not be stymied. The said provisions seek to improve the condition of the reproductive health care in the country.<br><br>Nevertheless, Congress recognized that, in enacting regulations to further the reproductive health of the people, including access to modem family planning methods, resistance thereto based on religious scruples would abound. Notwithstanding the presence of a compelling state interest in the promotion and protection of reproductive health, Congress deemed it proper to carve out exemptions that specifically take into account the religious dissensions of conscientious objectors, which effectively exempts them from the requirements imposed under Sections 7 and 23(a)(3). In this regard, it cannot thus be claimed that the said provisions invidiously interfere with the free exercise of religion.<br><br>Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that the government's effort to provide increased access to information, programs, and services regarding reproductive health would be seriously hampered by the exemption accorded to conscientious objectors. A considerable number of health facilities in the country are owned and operated by religious institutions. Likewise, being a predominantly Catholic country, there are a considerable number of health service providers who, due to their religious convictions, view modem methods of family plarming, a major component of reproductive health under R.A. No. 10354, as immoral.<br><br>In view of the accommodation granted to conscientious objectors under Sections 7 and 23(a)(3), a great portion of the public would still be denied access to information, programs, and services regarding reproductive health, thus, effectively defeating the lofty objectives of R.A. No. 10354. Thus, Congress, still recognizing the religious freedom of conscientious objectors, instead imposed on them the "duty to refer" the patients seeking reproductive health care and service to another health facility or reproductive health care service provider. Under the circumstances, the "duty to refer" imposes the least possible interference to the religious liberties of conscientious objectors.<br><br>Thus, the "duty to refer" imposed by Sections 7 and 23(a)(3) does not invidiously interfere with the religious freedom of conscientious objectors; any discomfort that it would cause the conscientious objectors is but an incidental burden brought about by the operation of a facially neutral and secular regulation. Not all infringements of religious beliefs are constitutionally impermissible. Just as the religious freedom of conscientious objectors must be respected, the higher interest of the State should likewise be afforded utmost protection.<br><br>Conscientious scruples have not, in the course of the long struggle for religious toleration, relieved an individual from obedience to a general law not aimed at the promotion or restriction of religious beliefs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> particularly in this case where the provisions in question have already given accommodation to religious dissensions.

The<i> ponencia</i> held that the "conscientious objection clause" under Section 23(a)(3) "should equally be protective of the religious belief of public health officers;" that the "protection accorded to other conscientious objectors should equally apply to all medical practitioners without distinction whether he belongs to the public or private sector."<br><br>I do not agree.<br><br>Equal protection simply provides that all persons or things similarly situated should be treated in a similar manner, both as to rights conferred and responsibilities imposed.

No. 10354 and its IRR.<br><br>There is a substantial distinction as regards a conscientious objector under Section 23(a)(3), who may be a public or private health care service provider, and a public officer specifically charged with the duty to implement the provisions of R.A. No. 10354 and its IRR. The Constitution provides that a public office is a public trust.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> An important characteristic of a public office is that its creation and conferment involves a delegation to the individual of some of the sovereign functions of government, to be exercised by him for the benefit of the public; that some portion of the sovereignty of the country, either legislative, executive, or judicial, attaches, for the time being, to be exercised for the public benefit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>That a public officer is specifically delegated with the a sovereign function of the government, i.e. the implementation of the provisions of RA 10354 and its IRR, is what sets him apart from a health care service provider under Section 23(a)(3). It should be clarified, however, that the religious accommodation extended to conscientious objectors under Section 23(a)(3) covers public health care service providers, who are likewise considered public officers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> However, unlike the public officers under Section 23(b) and Section 5.24 of the IRR, public health care service providers under Section 23(a)(3) are not specifically charged with the implementation of the provisions of R.A. No. 10354 and its IRR.<br><br>Further, classifying a public officer charged with the implementation of the provisions of R.A. No. 10354 and its IRR apart from health care service providers under Section 23(a)(3) is not only germane, but also necessary to the purpose of the law. To reiterate, the primary objective of R.A. No. 10354 is to provide an increased access to information, programs, and services regarding reproductive health. Allowing the same religious accommodation extended under Section 23(a)(3) to public officers charged with the implementation of the law would seriously hamper the delivery of the various programs and services regarding reproductive health under R.A. No. 10354. In this regard, a public officer specifically charged with the implementation of the provisions of R.A. No. 10354 and its IRR is considered an agent of the State; he cannot thus be allowed to effectively frustrate the legitimate interest of the State in enacting R.A. No. 10354 by refusing to discharge the sovereign functions delegated to him to the detriment of the public.<br><br>Moreover, the duration of the said classification is not limited to existing conditions. Also, the prohibition imposed under Section 23(b) and Section 5.24 of the IRR applies equally to all public officers specifically charged with the implementation of the law. Accordingly, the equal protection claim against Sections 23(b) and 5.24 of the IRR must evidently fail.<br><br>I agree though with the ponencia 's declaration that "the freedom to believe is intrinsic in every individual and the protective robe that guarantees its free exercise is not taken off even if one acquires employment in the government." Indeed, it is undeniable that a man does not shed his spirituality once he assumes public office. However, it cannot equally be denied that the State, in the pursuit of its legitimate secular objectives, should not be unnecessarily impeded by the religious scruples of its agents. Pursuant to the principle of separation of Church and State, it is not only the State that is prohibited from in purely ecclesiastical affairs; the Church is likewise barred from meddling in purely secular matters.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>Thus, in <i>People v.

While this Court sympathizes with his predicament, it is its bounden duty to emphasize that a court of law is no place for a protracted debate on the morality or propriety of the sentence, where the law itself provides for the sentence of death as a penalty in specific and well-defined instances. The discomfort faced by those forced by law to impose the death penalty is an ancient one, but it is a matter upon which judges have no choice.

Any discomfort that would be caused to such public officers is but a mere incidental burden in the exercise of their religious belief, which is justified by the compelling state interest in the enactment ofR.A. No. 10354.<br><br><b>Section 23(a)(2) punishes the refusal to perform reproductive health procedures due to lack of spousal consent and/or parental consent; it is not inimical to freedom of religion.</b><br><br>Section 23(a)(2)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> penalizes any health care service provider who refuses to perform legal and medically-safe reproductive health procedures on the ground of lack of consent or authorization of either: (1) the spouse, in the case of married persons; or (2) the parents or person exercising parental authority, in the case of abused minors, where the parent or the person exercising parental authority is the respondent, accused, or convicted perpetrator.<br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> struck down Section 23(a)(2) for being unconstitutional, pointing out that, "in the performance of reproductive health procedures, the religious freedom of health care service providers should be respected." The ponencia 's conclusion stems from a misapprehension of the acts penalized under Section 23(a)(2); it does not, in any manner, invidiously interfere with the religious rights of health care service providers.<br><br>Section 23(a)(2) does not penalize the refusal of a health care service provider to perform reproductive health procedures <i>per se</i>. What is being penalized by the provision is the refusal of a health care service provider to perform such procedures <b>on the ground of lack of spousal consent</b> or parental consent in certain cases. Indeed, for reasons to be explained at length later, a health care service provider cannot avoid the performance of reproductive health procedure, in case of married persons, <b>solely</b> on the ground of lack of spousal consent since there would be no justifiable reason for such refusal.<br><br>Likewise, it is quite absurd to expect that the parent of or one exercising parental authority over an abused minor would give consent for the latter's reproductive health procedure if he/she is the one responsible for the abuse. Thus, Section 23(a)(2) dispenses with the requirement of parental authority from the abusive parent or person exercising parental authority. In such case, a health care service provider cannot refuse the performance of reproductive health procedure on the abused minor solely on the ground of lack of parental consent.<br><br>Nevertheless, even in cases where the individual seeking reproductive health procedure is married or is an abused minor, a health care service provider <b>may validly refuse to perform such procedure if the objection thereto is based on his/her ethical or religious beliefs</b>. Section 23(a)(2) must be read in conjunction with Section 23(a)(3), which provides for religious accommodation of conscientious objectors. However, in such cases, the health care service provider would still have the duty to immediately refer the married individual or the abused minor to another health care service provider within the same facility or one, which is conveniently accessible.<br><br><b>Section 23(a)(2)(i) merely upholds the primacy of an individual's choice on matters affecting his/her health; it does not intrude into the right to marital privacy.</b><br><br>Essentially, Section 23(a)(2)(i)77 provides that a married individual may undergo a reproductive health procedure sans the consent/authorization of his/her spouse; that any health care service provider who would obstinately refuse to perform such procedure on a married individual on the pretext of the lack of spousal consent would be penalized accordingly.<br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> declared Section 23(a)(2)(i) as being contrary to Section 3, Article XV of the Constitution, which requires the State to defend the "right of the spouses to found a family," thus unduly infringing on the right to marital privacy. The <i>ponencia</i> explained that the said provision "refers to reproductive health procedures like tubal ligation and vasectomy which, by their very nature, require mutual consent and decision between the husband and wife as they affect issues intimately related to the founding of the family." The <i>ponencia</i> pointed out that decision-making concerning reproductive health procedure "falls within the protected zone of marital privacy" from which State intrusion is proscribed. Thus, the ponencia concluded, dispensing with the spousal consent is "disruptive of family unity" and "a marked departure from the policy of the State to protect marriage as an inviolable social institution."<br><br>It is conceded that intimate relations between husband and wife fall within the right of privacy formed by emanations of the various guarantees in the Bill ofRights, to which State intrusion is proscribed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> However, I do not agree that upholding a married individual's choice to submit to reproductive health procedure despite the absence of the consent or authorization of his/her spouse would be disruptive of the family.<br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> harps on the right to privacy that inheres in marital relationships. Yet the marital couple is not an independent entity, with a mind and heart of its own, but an association of two individuals, each with a separate intellectual and emotional makeup.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> While the law affirms that the right of privacy inheres in marital relationships, it likewise recognizes that a spouse, as an individual per se, equally has personal autonomy and privacy rights apart from the right to marital privacy guaranteed by the Constitution. <b>A spouse's personal autonomy and privacy rights</b>, as an individual<i> per se, </i>among others, necessitates that his/her decision on matters affecting his/her health, including reproductive health, be respected and given preference.<br><br>At the heart of Section 23(a)(2)(i) is the fundamental liberty of an individual to personal autonomy,<i> i.e.</i>, to decide on matters affecting his/her reproductive health. Section 23(a)(2)(i), contrary to the ponencia 's insinuation, does not hinder a married individual from conferring with his/her spouse on his/her intended reproductive health procedure. There is nothing in the said provision, which prevents a husband/wife from obtaining the consent/authorization for an intended reproductive health procedure. Nevertheless, the objection of the other spouse thereto, as common sense would suggest, should not prevent a married individual from proceeding with the reproductive health procedure since it is his/her bodily integrity that is at stake.<br><br>In this regard, the ruling of the US Supreme Court <i>Planned Parenthood v. Danforth</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> is instructive. <i>Danforth </i>involves a Missouri abortion statute, which, <i>inter alia</i>, required the written consent of the husband before a woman may be allowed to submit to an abortion81 during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. The US Supreme Court declared the spousal consent requirement unconstitutional for unduly intruding into the right to privacy of the woman. Thus:<br><br><blockquote>We now hold that the State may not constitutionally require the consent of the spouse, as is specified under § 3(3) of the Missouri Act, as a condition for abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. We thus agree with the dissenting judge in the present case, and with the courts whose decisions are cited above, that <b>the State cannot delegate to a spouse a veto power which the state itself is absolutely and totally prohibited from exercising</b> during the first trimester of pregnancy.<br><br>x x x Clearly, since the State cannot regulate or proscribe abortion during the first stage, when the physician and his patient make that decision, the State cannot delegate authority to any particular person, even the spouse, to prevent abortion during that same period.<br><br>We are not unaware of the deep and proper concern and interest that a devoted and protective husband has in his wife's pregnancy and in the growth and development of the fetus she is carrying. Neither has this Court failed to appreciate the importance of the marital relationship in our society. x x x Moreover, we recognize that the decision whether to undergo or to forgo an abortion may have profound effects on the future of any marriage, effects that are both physical and mental, and possibly deleterious. <b>Notwithstanding these factors, we cannot hold that the State has the constitutional authority to give the spouse unilaterally the ability to prohibit the wife from terminating her pregnancy when the State itself lacks that right</b>.x x x.<br><br><b>It seems manifest that, ideally, the decision to terminate a pregnancy should be one concurred in by both the wife and her husband. No marriage may be viewed as harmonious or successful if the marriage partners are fundamentally divided on so important and vital an issue. But it is difficult to believe that the goal of fostering mutuality and trust in a marriage, and of strengthening the marital relationship and the marriage institution, will be achieved by giving the husband a veto power exercisable for any reason whatsoever or for no reason at all</b>. Even if the State had the ability to delegate to the husband a power it itself could not exercise, it is not at all likely that such action would further, as the District Court majority phrased it, the "interest of the state in protecting the mutuality of decisions vital to the marriage relationship."<br><br>xxxx<br><br>We recognize, of course, that, when a woman, with the approval of her physician but without the approval of her husband, decides to terminate her pregnancy, it could be said that she is acting unilaterally. <b>The obvious fact is that, when the wife and the husband disagree on this decision, the view of only one of the two marriage partners can prevail. Inasmuch as it is the woman who physically bears the child and who is the more directly and immediately affected by the pregnancy, as between the two, the balance weighs in her favor.</b> x x x.<br><br>(Emphases ours)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup></blockquote><br><br>It is indeed ideal that the decision whether to submit to reproductive health procedure be a joint undertaking of the spouses, especially on such a vital and sensitive matter. It is inevitable, however, for cases to abound wherein a husband/wife would object to the intended procedure of his/her spouse. In such cases, the right to reproductive health of a spouse would be rendered effectively inutile. I do not see how fostering such stalemate, which can hardly be considered as a harmonious and blissful marital relationship, could "protect the marriage as an inviolable social institution."<br><br>Thus, the law, in case of disagreement, recognizes that the decision of the spouse undergoing the reproductive health procedure should prevail. In so declaring, Section 23(a)(2)(i) does not invidiously interfere with the privacy rights of the spouses. In dispensing with the spousal consent/authorization in case of disagreement, the law is not declaring a substantive right for the first time; even in the absence of such declaration, the decision of the spouse undergoing the reproductive health procedure would still prevail. Section 23(a)(2)(i) is but a mere recognition and affirmation of a married individual's constitutionally guaranteed personal autonomy and his/her right to reproductive health.<br><br><b>Requiring the rendition of <i>pro bono</i><br>reproductive health services to indigent women<br>for PhilHealth accreditation does not infringe on<br>religious freedom.</b><br><br>Section 17 encourages private and non-government reproductive health care service providers "to provide at least forty-eight (48) hours annually of reproductive health services, ranging from providing information and education to rendering medical services, free of charge to indigent and low-income patients."

Nevertheless, the <i>ponencia</i> declared Section 17 unconstitutional insofar as it affects conscientious objectors in securing PhilHealth accreditation; that conscientious objectors are exempt from rendition of reproductive health services, <i>pro bono</i> or otherwise.<br><br>While I agree with the <i>ponencia </i>that Section 17 does not amount to involuntary servitude and that requiring the rendition of <i>pro bono</i> reproductive health services for PhilHealth accreditation is not an unreasonable burden to health care service providers, I disagree that Section 17 is unconstitutional as applied to conscientious objectors.<br><br>As pointed out earlier, it is conceded that health care service providers may not be compelled to provide certain information or service regarding reproductive health if it would be anathema to his/her religious convictions. Specifically, under Section 17, a health care service provider may not be denied the opportunity to be accredited under R.A. No. 7875, otherwise known as the National Health Insurance Act of 1995, as amended by R.A. No. 10606, for his/her refusal to render <i>pro bono</i> reproductive health services <b>that are contrary to his/her religious beliefs.</b><br><br>However, that a health care service provider has religious objections to <b>certain reproductive health care services</b> does not mean that he/she is already exempted from the requirement under Section 17 for PhilHealth accreditation. The requirement under Section 17 is stated in general terms and is religion-neutral; it merely states that health care service providers, as a condition for PhilHealth accreditation, must render <i>pro bono</i> reproductive health service. The phrase "reproductive health care service" is quite expansive and is not limited only to those services, which may be deemed objectionable based on religious beliefs.<br><br>Reproductive health care includes: (1) family planning information and services; (2) maternal, infant and child health and nutrition, including breastfeeding; (3) proscription of abortion and management of abortion complications; (4) adolescent and youth reproductive health guidance and counseling; (5) prevention, treatment, and management of reproductive tract infections, HIV and AIDS, and other sexually transmittable infections; (6) elimination of violence against women and children, and other forms of sexual and gender-based violence; (7) education and counseling on sexuality and reproductive health; (8) treatment of breast and reproductive tract cancers, and other gynecological conditions and disorders; (9) male responsibility and involvement, and men's reproductive health; (10) prevention, treatment, and management of infertility and sexual dysfunction; (11) reproductive health education for adolescents; and (12) mental health aspect of reproductive health care.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>Thus, a health care service provider, his/her religious objections to certain reproductive health care services aside, may still render <i>pro bono</i> reproductive health care service, as a prerequisite for PhilHealth accreditation, by providing information or medical services, for instance, on treatment of breast and reproductive tract cancers, and other gynecological conditions and disorders or on maternal, infant and child health and nutrition.<br><br><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, I vote to <b>DECLARE UNCONSTITUTIONAL only</b> Section 7 of Republic Act No. 10354, insofar as it dispenses with the requirement of parental consent for minors who are already parents or have had a miscarriage, for being contrary to Section 12, Article II of the Constitution.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Section 9. <i>The Philippine National Drug Formulary System and Family Planning Supplies.</i> - The National Drug Formulary shall include hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine devices, injectables and other safe, legal, non-abortifacient and effective family planning products and supplies.

Due to the failure of the petitioners to present actual cases, it cannot be possible to see whether their religious objection can be accommodated in the application and interpretation of the law rather than nullify the provisions wholesale.<br><br>We should tread carefully when what is involved is a religion that is not the minority. Invocations of religious freedom can be a disguised way of imposing the dominant faith on others. This is especially true in physician-patient relationships.

This forum does not exist to undermine the democratically deliberated results coming from the Congress and approved by the President. Again, there is no injury to a fundamental right arising from concrete facts established with proof. Rather, the pleadings raise grave moral and philosophical issues founded on facts that have not yet happened.&nbsp; They are the product of speculation by the petitioners.<br><br>To steeled advocates who have come to believe that their advocacy is the one true moral truth, their repeated view may seem to them as the only factual possibility. Rabid advocacy of any view will be intolerant of the nuanced reality that proceeds from conscious and deliberate examination of facts.<br><br>This kind of advocacy should not sway us.<br><br>Our competence is to decide on legal principle only in concrete controversies. We should jealously and rigorously protect the principle of justiciability of constitutional challenges. We should preserve our role within the current constitutional order. We undermine the legitimacy of this court when we participate in rulings in the abstract because there will always be the strong possibility that we will only tend to mirror our own personal predilections. We should thus adopt a deferential judicial temperament especially for social legislation.<br><br>This law should not be declared as unconstitutional, in whole or in part, on the basis of the consolidated petitions.

(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The requirement for a “case” or “controversy” locates the judiciary in the scheme of our constitutional order.

When it is claimed that a statute is inconsistent with a provision of the Constitution, the meaning of a constitutional provision will be narrowly drawn.<br><br>Without the necessary findings of facts, this court is left to speculate leaving justices to grapple within the limitations of their own life experiences. This provides too much leeway for the imposition of political standpoints or personal predilections of the majority of this court. This is not what the Constitution contemplates. Rigor in determining whether controversies brought before us are justiciable avoids the counter majoritarian difficulties attributed to the judiciary.<br><br>Without the existence and proper proof of actual facts, any review of the statute or its implementing rules will be theoretical and abstract. Courts are not structured to predict facts, acts or events that will still happen. Unlike the legislature, we do not determine policy. We read law only when we are convinced that there is enough proof of the real acts or events that raise conflicts of legal rights or duties. Unlike the executive, our participation comes in after the law has been implemented. Verily, we also do not determine how laws are to be implemented.<br><br>The existence of a law or its implementing orders or a budget for its implementation is far from the requirement that there are acts or events where concrete rights or duties arise. The existence of rules do not substitute for real facts.<br><br>Petitioners cite <i>Province of North Cotabato v.

Consequent to the actual delineation of power, each branch of government is entitled to be left alone to discharge its duties as it sees fit. Being one such branch, the judiciary, as Justice Laurel asserted in Planas v.

Now then, if it be important to restrict the great departments of government to the exercise of their appointed powers, it follows, as a logical corollary, equally important, that one branch should be left completely independent of the others, independent not in the sense that the three shall not cooperate in the common end of carrying into effect the purposes of the constitution, but in the sense that the acts of each shall never be controlled by or subjected to the influence of either of the branches.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Eloquently, Justice Brion in his dissenting opinion in <i>Province of North Cotabato </i>asserted:<br><br><blockquote>x x x.

Its search for solutions, in the course of several presidencies, has led the Executive to the peace settlement process. As has been pointed out repetitively in the pleadings and the oral arguments, the latest move in the Executive’s quest for peace—the MOA-AD—would have not been a good deal for the country if it had materialized. This Court, however, seasonably intervened and aborted the planned signing of the agreement. The Executive, for its part, found it wise and appropriate to fully heed the signals from our initial action and from the public outcry the MOA-AD generated; it backtracked at the earliest opportunity in a manner consistent with its efforts to avoid or minimize bloodshed while preserving the peace process. At the moment, the peace and order problem is still with the Executive where the matter should be; the initiative still lies with that branch of government. The Court’s role, under the constitutional scheme that we are sworn to uphold, is to allow the initiative to be where the Constitution says it should be. <b><i>We cannot and should not interfere unless our action is unavoidably necessary because the Executive is acting beyond what is allowable, or because it has failed to act in the way it should act, under the Constitution and our laws.</i></b><br><br>x x x x<br><br><b><i>Rather than complicate the issues further with judicial pronouncements that may have unforeseen or unforeseeable effects on the present fighting and on the solutions already being applied, this Court should exercise restraint as the fears immediately generated by a signed and concluded MOA-AD have been addressed and essentially laid to rest.

But in other cases, even if it is found that a provision of a statute is unconstitutional, courts will decree only partial invalidity unless the invalid portion is so far inseparable from the rest of the statute that a declaration of partial invalidity is not possible.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br><br>Subsequently, in <i>Estrada v.

The theory is that “[w]hen statutes regulate or proscribe speech and no readily apparent construction suggests itself as a vehicle for rehabilitating the statutes in a single prosecution, the transcendent value to all society of constitutionally protected expression is deemed to justify allowing attacks on overly broad statutes with no requirement that the person making the attack demonstrate that his own conduct could not be regulated by a statute drawn with narrow specificity.</b>” The possible harm to society in permitting some unprotected speech to go unpunished is outweighed by the possibility that the protected speech of others may be deterred and perceived grievances left to fester because of possible inhibitory effects of overly broad statutes.<br><br>This rationale does not apply to penal statutes. Criminal statutes have general <i>in terrorem</i> effect resulting from their very existence, and, if facial challenge is allowed for this reason alone, the State may well be prevented from enacting laws against socially harmful conduct. In the area of criminal law, the law cannot take chances as in the area of free speech.<br><br><b>The overbreadth and vagueness doctrines then have special application only to free speech cases. They are inapt for testing the validity of penal statutes. As the U.S. Supreme Court put it, in an opinion by Chief Justice Rehnquist, “we have not recognized an ‘overbreadth’ doctrine outside the limited context of the First Amendment.</b>” In <i>Broadrick v. Oklahoma</i>, the Court ruled that “claims of facial overbreadth have been entertained in cases involving statutes which, by their terms, seek to regulate only spoken words” and, again, that “overbreadth claims, if entertained at all, have been curtailed when invoked against ordinary criminal laws that are sought to be applied to protected conduct.” For this reason, it has been held that “a facial challenge to a legislative Act is … the most difficult challenge to mount successfully, since the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid.”&nbsp; x x x.<br><br>In sum, the doctrines of strict scrutiny, overbreadth, and vagueness are analytical tools developed for testing “on their faces” statutes in free speech cases or, as they are called in American law, First Amendment cases. They cannot be made to do service when what is involved is a criminal statute. With respect to such statute, the established rule is that “one to whom application of a statute is constitutional will not be heard to attack the statute on the ground that impliedly it might also be taken as applying to other persons or other situations in which its application might be unconstitutional.” x x x.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Similarly, this court in <i>Prof. David v. Pres. Macapagal-Arroyo</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> laid down guides when a facial challenge may be properly brought before this court, thus:<br><br><blockquote><i>First and foremost,</i> the overbreadth doctrine is an analytical tool developed for testing “on their faces” statutes in <b>free speech cases</b>, also known under the American Law as First Amendment cases.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Thus, claims of facial overbreadth are entertained in cases involving statutes which, <b>by their terms</b>, seek to regulate only <b>“spoken words”</b> and again, that <b>“overbreadth claims, if entertained at all, have been curtailed when invoked against ordinary criminal laws that are sought to be applied to protected conduct.”</b> Here, the incontrovertible fact remains that PP 1017 pertains to a spectrum of <b>conduct,</b> not free speech, which is manifestly subject to state regulation.<br><br><i>Second,</i> facial invalidation of laws is considered as <b>“manifestly strong medicine,” </b>to be used <b>“sparingly and only as a last resort,”</b> and is <b>“generally disfavored;”</b> The reason for this is obvious. Embedded in the traditional rules governing constitutional adjudication is the principle that a person to whom a law may be applied will not be heard to challenge a law on the ground that it may conceivably be applied unconstitutionally to others, i.e., <b>in other situations not before the Court</b>. A writer and scholar in Constitutional Law explains further:<br><br><blockquote><b>The most distinctive feature of the overbreadth technique is that it marks an exception to some of the usual rules of constitutional litigation. Ordinarily, a particular litigant claims that a statute is unconstitutional as applied to him or her; if the litigant prevails, the courts carve away the unconstitutional aspects of the law by invalidating its improper applications on a case to case basis. Moreover, challengers to a law are not permitted to raise the rights of third parties and can only assert their own interests. In overbreadth analysis, those rules give way; challenges are permitted to raise the rights of third parties</b>; and the court invalidates the entire statute “on its face,” not merely “as applied for” so that the overbroad law becomes unenforceable until a properly authorized court construes it more narrowly. The factor that motivates courts to depart from the normal adjudicatory rules is the concern with the “chilling;” deterrent effect of the overbroad statute on third parties not courageous enough to bring suit. The Court assumes that an overbroad law’s “very existence may cause others not before the court to refrain from constitutionally protected speech or expression.” An overbreadth ruling is designed to remove that deterrent effect on the speech of those third parties.</blockquote><br>In other words, a facial challenge using the overbreadth doctrine will require the Court to examine PP 1017 and pinpoint its flaws and defects, not on the basis of its actual operation to petitioners, but on the assumption or prediction that its very existence may cause <b>others not before the Court</b> to refrain from constitutionally protected speech or expression. In <i>Younger v. Harris</i>, it was held that:<br><br><blockquote>[T]he task of analyzing a proposed statute, pinpointing its deficiencies, and requiring correction of these deficiencies before the statute is put into effect, is rarely if ever an appropriate task for the judiciary. The combination of the <b>relative remoteness of the controversy, the impact on the legislative process of the relief sought, and above all the speculative and amorphous nature of the required line-by-line analysis of detailed statutes,</b>...ordinarily results in a kind of case that is <b>wholly unsatisfactory</b> for deciding constitutional questions, whichever way they might be decided.</blockquote><br>And <i>third,</i> a facial challenge on the ground of overbreadth is the most difficult challenge to mount successfully, since the challenger must establish that <b>there can be no instance when the assailed law may be valid</b>. Here, petitioners did not even attempt to show whether this situation exists.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)</blockquote><br>A similar view was adopted by this court in <i>Romualdez v.

As reflected earlier, this rationale is inapplicable to plain penal statutes that generally bear an “<i>in terrorem</i> effect” in deterring socially harmful conduct. In fact, the legislature may even forbid and penalize acts formerly considered innocent and lawful, so long as it refrains from diminishing or dissuading the exercise of constitutionally protected rights.<br><br>The Court reiterated that there are “critical limitations by which a criminal statute may be challenged” and “underscored that an ‘on-its-face’ invalidation of penal statutes x x x may not be allowed.”<br><br><blockquote>[T]he rule established in our jurisdiction is, only statutes on free speech, religious freedom, and other fundamental rights may be facially challenged. <b><u>Under no case may ordinary penal statutes be subjected to a facial challenge</u></b>. The rationale is obvious. If a facial challenge to a penal statute is permitted, the prosecution of crimes may be hampered. No prosecution would be possible. A strong criticism against employing a facial challenge in the case of penal statutes, if the same is allowed, would effectively go against the grain of the doctrinal requirement of an existing and concrete controversy before judicial power may be appropriately exercised. A facial challenge against a penal statute is, at best, amorphous and speculative. It would, essentially, force the court to consider third parties who are not before it. As I have said in my opposition to the allowance of a facial challenge to attack penal statutes, such a test will impair the State’s ability to deal with crime. If warranted, there would be nothing that can hinder an accused from defeating the State’s power to prosecute on a mere showing that, as applied to third parties, the penal statute is vague or overbroad, notwithstanding that the law is clear as applied to him.</blockquote><br>It is settled, on the other hand, that<b> the application of the overbreadth doctrine is limited to a facial kind of challenge and, owing to the given rationale of a facial challenge, applicable only to free speech cases.</b><br><br>By its nature, the overbreadth doctrine has to necessarily apply a facial type of invalidation in order to plot areas of protected speech, inevitably almost always <u>under situations not before the court</u>, that are impermissibly swept by the substantially overbroad regulation. Otherwise stated, a statute cannot be properly analyzed for being substantially overbroad if the court confines itself only to facts as applied to the litigants.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>In restricting the overbreadth doctrine to free speech claims, the Court, in at least two cases, observed that the US Supreme Court has not recognized an overbreadth doctrine outside the limited context of the First Amendment, and that claims of facial overbreadth have been entertained in cases involving statutes which, by their terms, seek to regulate only <u>spoken words</u>. In <i>Virginia v. Hicks,</i> it was held that rarely, if ever, will an overbreadth challenge succeed against a law or regulation that is not specifically addressed to <u>speech</u> or <u>speech-related conduct</u>. Attacks on overly broad statutes are justified by the “transcendent value to all society of constitutionally protected expression.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring in the original)</blockquote><br>The prevailing doctrine today is that:<br><br><blockquote>a facial challenge only applies to cases where the free speech and its cognates are asserted before the court. While as a general rule penal statutes cannot be subjected to facial attacks, a provision in a statute can be struck down as unconstitutional when there is a clear showing that there is an imminent possibility that its broad language will allow ordinary law enforcement to cause prior restraints of speech and the value of that speech is such that its absence will be socially irreparable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup></blockquote><br>Broken down into its elements, a facial review should only be allowed when:<br><br><blockquote>First, the ground for the challenge of the provision in the statute is that it violates freedom of expression or any of its cognates;<br><br>Second, the language in the statute is impermissibly vague;<br><br>Third, the vagueness in the text of the statute in question allows for an interpretation that will allow prior restraints;<br><br>Fourth, the “chilling effect” is not simply because the provision is found in a penal statute but because there can be a clear showing that there are special circumstances which show the imminence that the provision will be invoked by law enforcers;<br><br>Fifth, the application of the provision in question will entail prior restraints; and<br><br>Sixth, the value of the speech that will be restrained is such that its absence will be socially irreparable. This will necessarily mean balancing between the state interests protected by the regulation and the value of the speech excluded from society.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup></blockquote><br>Facial challenges can only be raised on the basis of overbreadth and not on vagueness. <i>Southern Hemisphere</i> demonstrated how vagueness relates to violations of due process rights, whereas facial challenges are raised on the basis of overbreadth and limited to the realm of freedom of expression.<br><br>None of these petitions justify a facial review of this social legislation.&nbsp; The free exercise of one’s religion may be a cognate of the freedom of expression.&nbsp; However, the petitions have not properly alleged the religion, the religious dogma, the actual application of the religious dogma where a repugnancy can be shown.&nbsp; They have also failed to demonstrate that the violation of the amorphous religious dogmas that they imagine should result in the invalidation of statutory text rather than simply an adjustment in its interpretation and in its application.<br><br><center>II<br>No <i>Locus Standi</i></center><br>Besides, the consolidated cases are improper class suits that should be dismissed outright.<br><br>A class suit is allowed under the rules<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> if those who instituted the action are found to be sufficiently numerous and representative of the interests of all those they seek to represent.

The entity cannot be considered as physically identical with the mother’s body. To consider the matter broadly, there is no essential difference between an ovum fertilized within the body and an ovum fertilized outside the parent’s body or rejected in an egg or emerging undeveloped, as in marsupials, in an external pouch. To destroy this entity is to destroy an existing life. <b>Since this life entity is clearly within the development of the human species, there is obviously nothing added on a human being</b>. Its destruction is the destruction of human life. Murder cannot be justified by a legal fiction. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup></blockquote><br>Further in the deliberations on this issue, Ms. Felicitas Aquino* propounded some concerns:<br><br><blockquote>MS. AQUINO: Madam President, before the issue on the right to life is lost in the interdebate on the vexing question of the U.S. bases, I am intervening to settle some matters about the matter of the right to life.<br><br>I am very much alarmed by the absolutist claim to morality in the defense of human life, the defense that was raised by Commissioner Villegas. There is presently a raging debate on the philo-ethical considerations of the origin or the beginnings of human life that at this moment, I do not think we are in any position to preempt the debate and come up with a premature conclusion on the matter. There are still pressing questions in my mind, such as: Is the biological existence of a potentiality for life synonymous with human personality? Is viability synonymous with life? There are at least a dozen theories that attempt to address themselves to this kind of question. For example, we are aware of the Thomistic concept of hylomorphism which posits the complementarity of matter and form. The theory demands that before human life is assumed, the material body demands a certain measure of organization and form that makes it capable of receiving a soul. It operates on the premise that individuality is the basic premise and the fundamental criterion for human life and human personality and individuality requires consciousness and self-reflection.<br><br>There is another theory which states that human life begins two to three weeks after conception; that is after the possibility on the process of twinning the zygote or the recombination of the zygote is finally ruled out. These are questions that need to be addressed in our Civil Code. For example, in the context of this discussion, Articles 40 and 41 are settled that personality is determined by birth, and that for all purposes favorable to it, a conceived baby is considered born but subject to the conditions of Article 41 which says that personality is determined by live birth. I would think that Articles 40 and 41 are not only settled, but are the most practical approach to the raging debate on the matter of human life. It lays as the criteria for its conclusion the individual biological criteria, with special emphasis on the physical separation of the fetus from the mother and the requirements of viability.<br><br>I am alarmed by the way we tend to preempt this kind of discussion by invoking the claims of the righteousness of morality. These questions for me are transcendental that we cannot even attempt to address any conclusion on the matter unless we can address the question without temerity or without bigotry. Besides, the level of human knowledge on this debate is so severely restricted that to preempt the debate is, I guess, to preempt the deliberations and finally the possibility of agreement on the diverse theories on the matter.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup></blockquote><br>In response, Mr. Villegas dismissed the concerns and declared that the issue of the beginning of life is already settled.<br><br><blockquote>MR. VILLEGAS: Madam President, it is precisely because this issue is transcendental that we have to make also a transcendental statement. <b>There is no debate among medical scientists that human life begins at conception, so that is already a settled question</b>. We are talking about life. As I said, we are not talking about human personality, neither are we saying that the human person can be decided precisely by law, nor at what time it will have the right to property and inheritance. <b>The only right that we are protecting is the right to life at its beginning, which medical science genetics has already confirmed as beginning at conception.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup> (Emphases supplied)</blockquote><br>The Constitutional Commission deliberations show that it is not true that the issue of when life begins is already a settled matter.

AQUINO: I cannot. This is very instructive because as the Commissioner will note, even this Commission cannot settle the question of whether a fertilized egg has the right to life or not. Those experts in the field of medicine and theology cannot settle this question. It is bad enough for us to pre-empt this controversial issue by constitutionalizing the ovum; it would be doubly tragic for us to provide for ambiguities which may even disturb settled jurisprudence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[164]</sup></blockquote><br>Mr. Nolledo answered:<br><br><blockquote>MR. NOLLEDO: I do not think there is ambiguity because the <b>fertilized egg, in the normal course of events, will be developed into a human being, a fetus, and as long as the normal course of events is followed.</b> I think that the right to life exists and the Constitution should recognize that right to life. We do not presume accidents; we do not presume ambiguities.

In Benagiano, et al.’s paper entitled <i>Fate of Fertilized Human Oocytes,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[166]</sup> it was shown that pre-clinical pregnancy wastage is at least 50%.

If normalcy is defined by this percentage, then it is pregnancy wastage that is normal and not spontaneous development until birth. Based on these, there may be no basis to the presumption that a fertilized ovum will “ripen into human personality” as Mr. Nolledo suggested.<br><br>To highlight the fallibility of the Constitutional Commissioners, one of them argued that a fertilized ovum is human because it is the only species that has 46 chromosomes.&nbsp; Thus:<br><br><blockquote>MR. VILLEGAS: x x x. Is it human? Genetics gives an equally categorical "yes." At the moment of conception, the nuclei of the ovum and the sperm rupture. As this happens 23 chromosomes from the ovum combine with 23 chromosomes of the sperm to form a total of 46 chromosomes.<b> A chromosome count of 46 is found <i>only</i> — and I repeat, only — in human cells.</b> Therefore, the fertilized ovum is human.

The intention behind the statement is precisely for the State to make sure that it protects the life of the pregnant mother.

This is most especially applicable among those involved such as the mother and the health care professionals.<br><br>Following a declaration in the ponencia that life begins at fertilization, the removal of a fertilized egg in an ectopic pregnancy must necessarily constitute taking of life.

Conscience appears to be the broader category. Objections based on conscience can be unique to the individual’s determination of what is right or wrong based on ethics or religion. Objections based on religion, on the other hand, imply a set of beliefs that are canonical to an institution or a movement considered as a religion. Others share religious belief. Conscientious objection may also include those whose bases are unique only to the person claiming the exception. One’s conscience may be shaped by cultural factors other than religion.

Natural law or the law of nature was the basis for these ideals. The famous Stoic jurist Ulpian supplied to Christian writers their understanding of natural law. For Ulpian, natural law consisted in the laws of nature that animals and humans had in common. Among the domestic animals with which Ulpian was familiar, the female accepted the male only when she was in heat. <i><b>So it was the law of nature for humans and animals alike that sexual intercourse should only take place for breeding.</b></i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[296]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The Catholic Church through Pope Paul VI later secretly created a Pontifical Commission for the Study of Population, Family and Births to recommend whether modern contraceptive methods could be permitted.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[297]</sup> The commission’s final report concluded, by two-third votes, that “no natural law proscribed non-reproductive sex and no doctrinal, scientific, medical, social or other reason existed for the church to continue prohibiting the use of modern birth control.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[298]</sup><br><br>Despite these findings, two ultraconservative members issued a minority report arguing that “the Vatican’s authority would be irreparably undermined if it abandoned a position it had adopted hundreds of years earlier.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[299]</sup><br><br>Consequently, Pope Paul VI issued <i>Humanae Vitae</i> reiterating Pope Pius XI’s 1930 encyclical <i>Casti Connubii </i>on natural law’s proscription against sex without procreative intent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[300]</sup> The commission’s creation and its reports were leaked to the public, resulting in mass protests and defiance within the church.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[301]</sup><br><br>Intervenors quoted at length a detailed account of these events surrounding the <i>Casti Connubii and Humanae Vitae, </i>thus:<br><br><blockquote>Nervous prelates in Rome felt that the pill was just an excuse to jettison the Vatican's position on birth control, which was resented and under siege. The euphoria over new freedoms was part of the social giddiness that characterized the 1960s, in the church as in the secular world. It was a time of the sexual revolution, feminism, and new attitudes toward authority. In this atmosphere, the papal pronouncements about natural law were brought under closer scrutiny by natural reason, and they grew flimsier with every look. There was great fear in the Curia of the Vatican that this mood would invade the Council Pope John was assembling (as, in fact, it did). <b><i>The whole matter of birth control was considered especially endangered, and it would be fought over strenuously in two Roman arenas, one open and one Secret. The former battle, carried on in the sessions of the Vatican Council, reached a kind of stalemate in the conciliar decree on the church in the modern world, Gaudiumet et Spes. The other battle, waged in secret by the Pope's own special commission, led to that commission's stunning defeat by the Pope's own encyclical Humanae Vitae</i></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[302]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br><br><center><i>Humanae Vitae</i></center><br>That Pontifical Commission met five times, at first in the fall of 1963 - six men convening at Louvain. The second meeting (like all subsequent ones) was in Rome, in the spring of 1964, attended by the thirteen men. The number was increased to fifteen for a meeting that summer. Up to this point, no one had presumed to recommend altering the church's teaching on contraception. Things changed at the fourth session, held in the spring of 1965, when the size of the commission jumped up to fifty- eight, with five women among the thirty-four lay members. An expert called in for consultation was John T. Noonan, from Notre Dame in Indiana, whose study of the church's changing positions on usury had won scholarly acclaim. He was working on a similar study of changes in the prohibition of contraception - a book that would appear just as the commission was disbanded. Noonan opened the members' eyes to the way that noninfallible papal teaching can develop.<br><br>Another eye opener was the result of a questionnaire brought to Rome by the lay couple Pat and Patty Crowley. They had long been active in the international Christian Family Movement, and they had surveyed their members - devout Catholics all - on their experience of the rhythm method of contraception. They found it far from natural- Since a woman's period fluctuates with her health, anxieties, age, and other influences, establishing the actual infertile period in any cycle required daily charting of her temperature and close comparative reading of calendars - and even then the results were not Sure. The most conscientious catholics, who followed this nervous procedure with precision, found that it was not certain - which left them in great fear until the next menstruation (which might not occur). And in this concentration on the wife's physical conditions, her psychological patterns - of fondness, need, crises, travel - had to be ignored or repressed. The comments of the couples surveyed made riveting reading in the commission. A husband, a scholar, wrote:<br><br><blockquote>Rhythm destroys the meaning of sex act; it turns it from a spontaneous expression of spiritual and physical love into a mere bodily sexual relief; it makes me obsessed with sex throughout the month; it seriously endangers my chastity; it has a noticeable effect upon my disposition toward my wife and children; it makes necessary my complete avoidance toward my wife for three weeks at a time. I have watched a magnificent spiritual and physical union dissipate and, due to rhythm, turn into a tense and mutually damaging relationship. Rhythm seems to be immoral and deeply unnatural. It seems to be diabolical.</blockquote><br>His wife gave her side of the story:<br><br><blockquote>I find myself sullen and resentful of my husband when the time of sexual relations finally arrives. I resent his necessarily guarded affection during the month and I find I cannot respond suddenly. I find, also, that my subconscious and unguarded thoughts are inevitably sexual and time consuming. All this in spite of a great intellectual and emotional companionship and a generally beautiful marriage and home life.</blockquote><br>The commission was hearing that rhythm made people obsessed with sex and its mechanics while minority members at the Council were arguing that rhythm allows people to escape the merely animal urges and enjoy the serenity of sexuality transcended. The commission was also hearing from doctors that nature, of course, provides women with their greatest sexual desire at just the fertile time that rhythm marked off bounds.<br><br><b><i>The combined impact of Noonan's history and the Crowley's empirical findings made the commission members - good Catholics all, chosen for their loyalty to the church - look honestly at the "natural law" arguments against contraception and see, with a shock, what flimsy reasoning they had accepted. Sex is for procreation, yes - but all the time, at each and every act?</i></b> Eating is for subsistence. But any food or drink beyond that necessary for sheer subsistence is not considered mortally sinful. In fact, to reduce to that animal compulsion would deny symbolic and spiritual meanings in shared meals - the birthday party, the champagne victory dinner, the wine at Cana, the Eucharist itself. Integrity of the act? Is it sinful to be nourished intravenously when that is called for? Does that violate the integrity of the eating act? The more assembled members looked at the inherited "wisdom" of the church, the more they saw the questionable roots from which it grew - the fear and hatred of sex, the feeling that pleasure in it is a biological bribe to guarantee the race's perpetuation, that any use of pleasure beyond that purpose is shameful. <i><b>This was not a view derived from scripture or from Christ, but from Seneca and Augustine.</b></i><br><br>The commission members, even trained theologians and spiritual counselors who had spent years expounding the church teachings, felt they were looking at reality for the first time. A cultivated submission to the papacy had been, for them, a structure of deceit, keeping them from honesty with themselves, letting them live within a lie. <b><i>To their shared surprise they found they were not only willing to entertain the idea of the church's changing, but felt that it had to change on this matter, that the truth, once seen, could no longer be denied. When the nineteen theologians on the commission, convened for a separate vote, were asked whether church teaching could change on contraception, twelve said yes, seven no (including John Ford, who had joined the commission at this meeting).</i></b><br><br>This set off alarm bells in the Vatican. For the next meeting, the last and the longest, from April to June of 1965, the members of the commission were demoted to "advisers" (periti) and the commission itself was constituted of sixteen bishops brought in to issue the final report. They would listen to those who had done the actual conferring, and theirs would be the final verdict. Debate before them would be presided over by Cardinal Ottaviani of the Holy Office. This bringing in the big guns would have cowed the members in their first sessions. But things had gone too far for such intimidation now. The Crowleys brought another survey with them to the showdown, this one of 3,000 Catholics - including 290 devout subscribers to the magazine St. Anthony's Messenger - of whom 63 percent said that rhythm had harmed their marriage and 65 percent said that it did not actually prevent conception, even when the right procedures were followed exactly (even neurotically). Dr. Albert Gorres spoke of the self- censorship Catholics had exercised over themselves - something the members recognized in their lives when it was pointed out. The Jesuit priest Josef Fuchs, who had taught <i>Casti Connubii</i> standards for twenty years, said he was withdrawing his moral textbook and resigning his teaching post at the Gregorian University in Rome now that he could no longer uphold what he was asked to profess. <i><b>The vote of the theologians who were presenting their findings to the bishops was now fifteen to four against the claim that conception is intrinsically evil. The vote of the larger group was thirty to five.</b></i><br><br>Here was a perfect laboratory test of the idea that contraception is against nature, as that can be perceived by natural reason alone. These people were all educated, even expert. They were Catholics in good standing (they had been chosen on those grounds). They had been conditioned all their lives to accept the church’s teaching - in fact they had accepted it in the past. They of all people would entertain the official case with open minds. They had no malice against church authorities - most of them had devoted much (if not all) of their lives to working with them. Most had entered the project either agreeing with the papal position or thinking that it was unlikely to change. Now they found themselves agreeing that change was not only necessary but inevitable. They had trouble imagining how they had ever thought otherwise. Cardinal Suenens explained how they had been conditioned to have a double consciousness, to live a lie:<br><br><blockquote>For years theologians have had to come up with arguments on behalf of a doctrine they were not allowed to contradict. They had an obligation to defend the received doctrine, but my guess is they already had many hesitations about it inside. As soon as the question was opened up a little, a whole group of moralists arrived at the position defended by the majority here. . . The bishops defended the classical position, but it was imposed on them by authority. The bishops didn't study the pros and cons. The received directives, they bowed to them, and they tried to explain them to their congregations.</blockquote><br><b><i>As soon as people began to think independently about the matter, the whole structure of deceit crumbled at the touch. The past position could not be sustained, even among these people picked by the Vatican itself, much less among Catholics not as committed as these were. And it was absurd to speak of the non-Catholic world as ever recognizing this "natural law of natural reason."</i></b><br><br>The need to face the prospect of change was impressed on the people in the commission by the arguments of the five theologians defending <i>Casti Connubii</i>. They reduced their own case to absurdities. John Ford said that intercourse is not necessary for marital love: "Conjugal love is above all spiritual (if the love is genuine) and it requires no specific carnal gesture, much less its repetition in some determined frequency." Ford also liked to say that, if the teaching on sexual activity only for procreation were changed, people could rnasturbate with impunity. Dr. Gorres quoted the Melchite Patriarch, Maximos IV, who said in the Council deliberations that priests display a "celibate psychosis" in the area of sex. ***<br><br><b><i>The climactic vote of the commission - the one of the sixteen bishops - was nine to three for changing the church's position on contraception, with three abstentions. An agreement had been reached before the vote was taken to submit only one report for the commission, but Cardinal Ottaviani and Father Ford, seeing how things were going, had prepared a document of their own, which would later be misrepresented as an official minority document</i></b>. There was only one official document, the sole one voted on by the bishops who had authority to report the body's findings. (Ottaviani was the one who had brought in these officials, hoping to get the result he wanted. When he failed to, he ignored his own device.)<br><br>The Ford “report”, drawn up with Germain Grisez, said that any change was inconceivable. This was not because there were rational arguments against change: "If we could bring forward arguments which are clear and cogent based on reason alone, it would not be necessary for our Commission to exist, nor would the present state of affairs exist in the church." No, the real reason to keep the teaching was that it was the teaching: "The Church could not have erred though so many centuries, even through one century, by imposing under serious obligations very grave burdens the name of Jesus Christ, if Jesus Christ did not actually impose these burdens."<b><i> As a priest had put it in earlier debate, if the church sent all those souls to hell, it must keep maintaining that that is where they are.</i></b><br><br><b><i>This was not an argument that made sense, at this point, to the commission - to bishops any more than to the theologians or lay experts. But it was the one argument that, in the end, mattered to Paul VI. He took advantage of the so-called "minority report" to say that he could not accept the commission's findings since there had been disagreement with it. </i></b>Nine of the twelve bishops, fifteen of the nineteen theologians, and thirty of the thirty-five nonepiscopal members of the commission were not enough for him. Votes on the decrees in the Council had not been unanimous either, but he did not call them invalid for that reason. Paul's real concern was with the arguments that Ottaviani brought to him after the report was submitted. He knew what was worrying the Pope, and could play on that. F.X. Murphy had observed one thing about Paul's behavior throughout the meetings of the Council:<br><br><blockquote>The Pope was a man obviously torn by doubts, tormented by scruples, haunted by thoughts of perfection, and above all dominated by an exaggerated concern - some called it an obsession - about the prestige of his office as Pope. His remarks on this score at times displayed an almost messianic fervor, a note missing in the more sedate utterances of his predecessors. His innumerable statements on the subject were made on almost every occasion, from casual week-day audiences of Sunday sermons from the window of his apartment to the most solemn gatherings in season and out of season. Since it was part of the strategy of the [conciliar] minority to accuse the majority of disloyalty toward the Holy Father' Paul's constant harping-in inevitably caused the majority to think that he perhaps did share these misgivings, at least to a certain extent. It was noticed by students of Paul’s remarks that while he showed an open- mindedness about almost any other subject, on the single theme of the papacy his mind remained strangely closed to analysis.<br></blockquote>Those words were written before Humanae Vitae was issued, but they explain the letter entirely.<br><br><b><i>The commission members left their work convinced that the pope could no longer uphold a discredited teaching. When the report was leaked to the press, Catholics around the world took heart at the signs of change. So far from upsetting their faith, as the Pope feared, it heartened them. What would unsettle their faith was what Paul did next - issue Humanae Vitae, with its reiteration of Casti Connubii's ban</i></b>: ('The church, calling men back to the observance of the natural law, as interpreted by its constant doctrine, teaches that each and every marriage act must remain open to the transmission of life." Catholics responded with an unparalleled refusal to submit. Polls registered an instant noncompliance with the encyclical. At a previously scheduled Catholic festival of devout young Germans at Essen, a resolution that those attending could not obey the encyclical passed through a crowd of four thousand with only ninety opposing votes. A simultaneous poll among German Catholics at large found that 68 percent of them thought the Pope was wrong on contraception. Similar findings rolled in from around the world.<br><br>What were bishops to do? The encyclical itself had ordered them to explain and enforce the Pope’s decision, along with all priests:<br><br><blockquote>Be the first to give, in the exercise of your ministry, the example of loyal internal and external obedience to the teaching authority of the Church. . . it is of the utmost importance, for peace, of consciences and for the unity of the Christian People, that in the field of morals as well as in that of dogma, all should attend to the magisterium of the Church, and all should speak the same language.</blockquote><br><b><i>But for the first time in memory, bishop's statements, while showing respect for the encyclical, told believers they could act apart from it if they felt bound by conscience to do so. The assembly of bishops in the Netherlands put it most bluntly: "The assembly considers that the encyclical's total rejection of contraceptive methods is not convincing on the basis of the arguments put forward.</i></b>" other Episcopal panels were more circumspect, but signaled that they would not consider those disobedient to the encyclical to be separating themselves from the sacraments. The Belgian bishops put it this way: "Someone, however, who is competent in the matter under consideration and capable of forming a personal and well-founded judgment - which necessarily presupposes a sufficient amount of knowledge - may, after serious examination before God, come to other conclusions on certain points." <b><i>In other words: do not treat the Pope's words lightly, but follow your conscience after taking a serious look at them. That was the position taken by bishops in the United States ("the norms of licit dissent come into play"), Austria, Brazil, Czechoslovakia, Mexico, [] West Germany, Japan, France, Scandinavia, and Switzerland</i></b>. The Scandinavian statement was typical:<br><br><blockquote><i><b>Should someone, however, for grave and carefully considered reasons, not feel able to subscribe to the arguments of the encyclical, he is entitled, as has been constantly acknowledged, to entertain other views than those put forward in a non-infallible declaration of the Church. No one should, therefore, on account of such diverging opinions along, be regarded as an inferior Catholic.</b></i></blockquote><br>The Pope was stunned. He would spend the remaining ten years of his pontificate as if sleepwalking, unable to understand what had happened to him, why such open dissent was entertained at the very top of the episcopate. Four years after the publication of <i>Humanae Vitae</i>, when the Pope looked "cautious, nervous, anxious, alarmed," he deplored the defiance of church teaching in a sermon at Saint Peter's, and this was the only explanation he could come up with for the defiance: "Through some crack in the temple of God, the smoke of Satan has entered'" He was increasingly melancholy and prone to tears. Had he opened that crack in the temple of God? Even as a nagging suspicion this was a terrible burden to bear. It explains the atmosphere of darkening tragedy that hung about his final years. He would not issue another encyclical in all those ten years. He was a prisoner of the Vatican in a way that went beyond his predecessors' confinement there. He was imprisoned in its structures of deceit. Meanwhile, Father Ford, who had assisted his fellow Jesuit Gustave Martelet in drawing up <i>Humanae Vitae </i>under Cardinal Ottaviani's direction, went back to the seminary where he had taught moral theology for years and found that the Jesuit seminarians their refused to take his classes, since they knew from others in the Order what he had done in Rome.

So it is likewise in our jurisdiction. The right to privacy as such is accorded recognition independently of its identification with liberty; in itself, it is fully deserving of constitutional protection. The language of Prof. Emerson is particularly apt: ‘The concept of limited government has always included the idea that governmental powers stop short of certain intrusions into the personal life of the citizen. This is indeed one of the basic distinctions between absolute and limited government. <b><i>Ultimate and pervasive control of the individual, in all aspects of his life, is the hallmark of the absolute state.</i></b> In contrast, a system of limited government safeguards a private sector, which belongs to the individual, firmly distinguishing it from the public sector, which the state can control Protection of this private sector – protection, in other words, of the dignity and integrity of the individual – has become increasingly important as modern society has developed. All the forces of a technological age – industrialization, urbanization, and organization – operate to narrow the area of privacy and facilitate intrusions into it. In modern terms, the capacity to maintain and support this enclave of private life marks the difference between a democratic and a totalitarian society.’<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[311]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>This is one view.&nbsp; It did not take into consideration the state’s interest in ensuring human rights and the fundamental equality of women and men.<br><br>The right to a family should be read in relation to several provisions in the Constitution that guarantee the individual’s control over her or his own person.&nbsp; Thus, Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution states:<br><br><blockquote>Section 1.

This includes the individual’s right to existence as well as her or his right to a quality of life of her or his choosing.&nbsp; The State is not to sanction a program or an act that deprives the individual of her or his control over her or his life and body.&nbsp; The “equal protection” clause in this provision ensures that individuals, even those that enter into a married state, do not coexist and suffer under conditions of marital inequality.<br><br>Article II elaborates on the positive obligation of the State to the right to life as embodied in the due process clause in two sections.&nbsp; Sections 9 and 11 provide:<br><br><blockquote>Section 9.

There is no cogent reason to require a written parental consent for a minor who seeks access to modern family planning methods and dispense with such requirement if the minor is already a parent or has had a miscarriage. Under the Family Code, all minors, generally, regardless of his/her circumstances, are still covered by the parental authority exercised by their parents.
