				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The issue is whether the relocation of the petitioner by respondent Municipal Mayor during the election period from her office as the Local Civil Registrar to the Office of the Mayor just a few steps away constituted a prohibited act under the <i>Omnibus Election Code</i> and the relevant Resolution of the Commission on Elections.<br><br><center><b>The Case</b><br></center><br>Petitioner Elsie Causing (Causing) assails the Resolution of the Commission on Elections En Banc (COMELEC <i>En Banc</i>) promulgated on September 9, 2011 dismissing her complaint-affidavit dated June 8, 2010 docketed as E.O. Case No. 10-131 entitled <i>Elsie S. Causing v. Hernan D. Biron, Sr.</i> charging Municipal Mayor Hernan D.

Elizabeth Doronilla, the Provincial Election Supervisor (PES), recommended the dismissal of the complaint-affidavit for lack of probable cause to charge Mayor Biron with the violation of Section (h) of the <i>Omnibus Election Code</i>, as implemented by Resolution No. 8737.<br><br>On September 9, 2011, the COMELEC <i>En Banc </i>affirmed the findings and recommendation of PES Doronilla,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> observing that Mayor Biron did not transfer or detail Causing but only required her to physically report to the Mayor’s office and to perform her functions thereat; and that he did not strip her of her functions as the Municipal Civil Registrar, and did not deprive her of her supervisory functions over her staff.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Hence, this petition for <i>certiorari.</i><br><br><center><b>Issues</b><br></center><br>Causing submits that Office Order 12 and Office Order 13 were gross violations of COMELEC Resolution No. 8737, Series of 2009, that implemented Section 261 (g), (h), and (x) of the <i>Omnibus Election Code</i>; that the prohibition contained in said provisions covered any movement during the election period, whether it was by reassignment, appointment, promotion, or demotion, regardless of rank, level or salary of the affected personnel; that her detail to the Office of the Mayor was a clear case of personnel movement prohibited by law;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> and that Mayor Biron violated the provisions because he did not secure from the COMELEC the prior authority to transfer or detail her during the election period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>In addition, Causing claims that the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> committed grave abuse of discretion in affirming the findings of PES Doronilla to the effect that there was no probable cause to hold Mayor Biron liable for violating the <i>Omnibus Election Code</i>; and that the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> totally disregarded a crucial piece of evidence — the existence of Office Order No. 13 that had ordered the detail of Belonio as the Local Civil Registrar-designate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>In his comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Mayor Biron insists that the petition for <i>certiorari</i> should be dismissed because of the petitioner’s failure to file a motion for reconsideration in the COMELEC, and because of her failure to attach copies of equally important documents pertinent to the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> He emphasizes that Office Order No. 12 was issued by his office for the purpose of closely supervising her in performing her functions after complaints about her behavior in dealing with her co-workers and with the public transacting business in her office had been received by his office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> He accuses her of willfully suppressing evidence, specifically the two office orders that clarified that she would still be performing the functions of her office, albeit in the Office of the Mayor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Mayor Biron reiterates his counter-affidavit, namely: (a) that there was no transfer or detail involved, and any movement of Causing, if at all, was a purely physical transfer, that is, only a few steps from her office to the Office of the Mayor, without any change in the present work, agency, position, rank and compensation;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> and (b) that granting without admitting that the movement constituted reassignment, the same was not covered by the provisions of COMELEC Resolution No. 8737, which expressly limited the prohibition to either transfer or detail only.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Mayor Biron posits that Office Order No. 13 purportedly ordering the detail of Belonio as Local Civil Registrar-designate was a mere piece of paper, which Belonio never received.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> He points out that his actions were upheld by the decision dated August 13, 2010 of the Regional Office of the Civil Service Commission dismissing the appeal by Causing of the assailed office orders.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Finally, Mayor Biron asserts that Causing did not demonstrate that the COMELEC <i>En Banc </i>committed grave abuse of discretion in affirming the findings that there was no probable cause to hold him liable for violation of the <i>Omnibus Election Code</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>On its part, the COMELEC, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> defends its questioned resolution, stating that the words <i>transfer</i> and <i>detail</i>, having already acquired legislative and jurisprudential meanings, should not be understood in their literal sense; that Causing was neither transferred nor detailed; that she was not moved to a different office with the same rank, level and salary, or to another agency;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> and that Mayor Biron’s act of transferring the office space of Causing was intra vires, and found legal support in the power of supervision and control accorded to local chief executives under the <i>Local Government Code</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br><center><b>Ruling</b><br></center><br>The petition has no merit.<br><br><center><b>1.<br>Procedural Issue:<br>Causing did not file a motion for reconsideration<br>before filing the petition for <i>certiorari</i></b></center><br>Section 7, Article IX-A of the Constitution states that unless otherwise provided by the Constitution or by law, any decision, order, or ruling of each Commission may be brought to the Court on <i>certiorari</i> by the aggrieved party within 30 days from receipt of a copy thereof. For this reason, the <i>Rules of Court </i>(1997) contains a separate rule (Rule 64) on the review of the decisions of the COMELEC and the Commission on Audit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Rule 64 is generally identical with <i>certiorari </i>under Rule 65,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> except as to the period of the filing of the petition for <i>certiorari,</i> that is, in the former, the period is 30 days from notice of the judgment or final order or resolution sought to be reviewed but, in the latter, not later than 60 days from notice of the judgment, order or resolution assailed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Mayor Biron indicates that Causing did not file a motion for reconsideration before coming to the Court. Causing submits, however, that she was not required to file the motion for reconsideration because the only recourse of an aggrieved party from the decision of the COMELEC was the filing of the petition for <i>certiorari</i> under either Rule 64 or Rule 65.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>The well-established rule is that the motion for reconsideration is an indispensable condition before an aggrieved party can resort to the special civil action for <i>certiorari </i>under Rule 65 of the <i>Rules of Court</i>. The filing of the motion for reconsideration before the resort to <i>certiorari</i> will lie is intended to afford to the public respondent the opportunity to correct any actual or fancied error attributed to it by way of re-examination of the legal and factual aspects of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>The rule is not absolute, however, considering that jurisprudence has laid down exceptions to the requirement for the filing of a petition for<i> certiorari</i> without first filing a motion for reconsideration, namely: (<i>a</i>) where the order is a patent nullity, as where the court <i>a quo</i> has no jurisdiction; (<i>b</i>) where the questions raised in the <i>certiorari</i> proceedings have been duly raised and passed upon by the lower court, or are the same as those raised and passed upon in the lower court; (<i>c</i>) where there is an urgent necessity for the resolution of the question, and any further delay would prejudice the interests of the Government, or of the petitioner, or the subject matter of the petition is perishable; (<i>d</i>) where, under the circumstances, a motion for reconsideration would be useless; (<i>e</i>) where the petitioner was deprived of due process, and there is extreme urgency for relief; (f) where, in a criminal case, relief from an order of arrest is urgent, and the granting of such relief by the trial court is improbable; (<i>g</i>) where the proceedings in the lower court are a nullity for lack of due process; (<i>h</i>) where the proceeding was <i>ex parte</i> or in which the petitioner had no opportunity to object; and (<i>i</i>) where the issue raised is one purely of law or public interest is involved.<br><br>A perusal of the circumstances of the case shows that none of the foregoing exceptions was applicable herein. Hence, Causing should have filed the motion for reconsideration, especially because there was nothing in the COMELEC Rules of Procedure that precluded the filing of the motion for reconsideration in election offense cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, the petition must be dismissed.<br><br><b><center>2.<br>Substantive Issues:<br>Mayor Biron’s acts did not violate<br>the <i>Omnibus Election Code</i><br>and the COMELEC Resolution</center></b><br><br>On the merits, the petition should also fail.<br><br>E.O. Case No. 10-131 was founded on Mayor Biron’s alleged violation of COMELEC Resolution No. 8737, Series of 2009, in relation to Section 261(g), (h) and (x) of the <i>Omnibus Election Code</i>, which respectively provide:<br><br><blockquote><center><u>Resolution No. 8737</u></center><br><br>Section 1. <u>Prohibited Acts</u><br><br>A. During the election period from January 10, 2010 to June 09, 2010, no public official shall, except upon prior authority of the Commission:<br><ol><li>Make or cause any transfer or detail whatsoever of any officer or employee in the civil service, including public school teachers. “<b>Transfer</b>” as used in this provision shall be construed as any personnel movement from one government agency to another or from one department, division, geographical unit or subdivision of a government agency to another with or without the issuance of an appointment.</li></ol>x x x x<br><br><center>Section 261(g), (h) and (x)<br><u>of the<i> Omnibus Election Code</i></u><br></center><br>Sec. 261. Prohibited Acts. - The following shall be guilty of an election offense:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(g) Appointment of new employees, creation of new position, promotion, or giving salary increases. - During the period of forty-five days before a regular election and thirty days before a special election, (1) any head, official or appointing officer of a government office, agency or instrumentality, whether national or local, including government-owned or controlled corporations, who appoints or hires any new employee, whether provisional, temporary or casual, or creates and fills any new position, except upon prior authority of the Commission. The Commission shall not grant the authority sought unless, it is satisfied that the position to be filled is essential to the proper functioning of the office or agency concerned, and that the position shall not be filled in a manner that may influence the election.<br><br>As an exception to the foregoing provisions, a new employee may be appointed in case of urgent need: Provided, however, That notice of the appointment shall be given to the Commission within three days from the date of the appointment. Any appointment or hiring in violation of this provision shall be null and void.<br><br>(2) Any government official who promotes, or gives any increase of salary or remuneration or privilege to any government official or employee, including those in government-owned or controlled corporations.<br><br>(h) Transfer of officers and employees in the civil service. - Any public official who makes or causes any transfer or detail whatever of any officer or employee in the civil service including public school teachers, within the election period except upon prior approval of the Commission.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(x) Suspension of elective provincial, city, municipal or barangay officer. - The provisions of law to the contrary notwithstanding during the election period, any public official who suspends, without prior approval of the Commission, any elective provincial, city, municipal or barangay officer, unless said suspension will be for purposes of applying the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act in relation to the suspension and removal of elective officials; in which case the provisions of this section shall be inapplicable.<br></blockquote><br>The only personnel movements prohibited by COMELEC Resolution No. 8737 were transfer and detail. <i>Transfer</i> is defined in the Resolution as “any personnel movement from one government agency to another or from one department, division, geographical unit or subdivision of a government agency to another with or without the issuance of an appointment;” while detail as defined in the <i>Administrative Code of 1987</i> is the movement of an employee from one agency to another without the issuance of an appointment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Having acquired technical and legal meanings, transfer and detail must be construed as such. Obviously, the movement involving Causing did not equate to either a<i> transfer</i> or a <i>detail</i> within the contemplation of the law if Mayor Biron only thereby physically transferred her office area from its old location to the Office of the Mayor “some little steps” away.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> We cannot accept the petitioner’s argument, therefore, that the phrase “any transfer or detail whatsoever” encompassed “any and all kinds and manner of personnel movement,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> including the mere change in office location.<br><br>Moreover, Causing’s too-literal understanding of <i>transfer</i> should not hold sway because the provisions involved here were criminal in nature. Mayor Biron was sought to be charged with an election offense punishable under Section 264 of the <i>Omnibus Election Code</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> It is a basic rule of statutory construction that penal statutes are to be liberally construed in favor of the accused. Every reasonable doubt must then be resolved in favor of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> This means that the courts must not bring cases within the provision of a law that are not clearly embraced by it. In short, no act can be pronounced criminal unless it is clearly made so by statute prior to its commission (<i>nullum crimen, nulla poena, sine lege</i>). So, too, no person who is not clearly within the terms of a statute can be brought within them.<br><br>Equally material is that Mayor Biron’s act of transferring the office space of Causing was rooted in his power of supervision and control over the officials and employees serving in his local government unit, in order to ensure the faithful discharge of their duties and functions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> His explanation that he transferred Causing’s work station from her original office to his office in order to closely supervise her after his office received complaints against her could not be justly ignored. Verily, she thereafter continued to perform her tasks, and uninterruptedly received her salaries as the Municipal Civil Registrar even after the transfer to the Office of the Mayor.<br><br>The issuance of Office Order No. 13 by Mayor Biron detailing Belonio to the Office of the Local Civil Registrar was not proof of Mayor Biron’s “crystal clear intention” to replace and transfer her during the election period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> As the COMELEC <i>En Banc </i>found, Belonio did not receive the order, and Causing remained as the Municipal Civil Registrar, leaving the detailing of Belonio uncompleted. Without the actual appointment of Belonio as the Municipal Civil Registrar, it would be unwarranted to criminally charge Mayor Biron of violating Section 261 of the <i>Omnibus Election Code</i>.<br><br>It is interesting to note that aside from the present election offense case, Causing initiated an administrative case in the Civil Service Commission to challenge her “reassignment” pursuant to the same office orders. In that administrative case, she referred to the personnel movement not as a <i>transfer</i> or <i>detail</i>, but as a <i>reassignment</i> that constituted her constructive dismissal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> On August 13, 2010, the CSC Regional Office No. 6 in Mandurriao, Iloilo City ruled that although Mayor Biron used the word detail in referring to the personnel movement effected, the personnel action that actually took place, albeit a reassignment, was a valid reassignment, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>In the instant case, <u>Causing is not stripped of her functions as Municipal Civil Registrar (MCR). She was merely required to physically report to the Mayor’s Office and perform her functions as Municipal Civil Registrar therein. Definitely, she is still the MCR, albeit doing her work physically outside of her usual work station. She is also not deprived of her supervisory function over the staff as she continues to review their work and signs documents they prepared. While she may encounter difficulty in performing her duties as a supervisor as she is not physically near her staff, that by itself, however, does not mean that she has lost supervision over them</u>. That difficulty, nonetheless, is not tantamount to constructive dismissal. That Mayor Biron prefers to ensure that Causing faithfully discharging her duties as MCR is principally an exercise of his sound judgment and discretion. He alone has the discretion to decide when to resort to the necessity of implementing changes in the workplace as he occupies the ideal vantage point and is in the best position to determine the needs of his agency and how to satisfy those needs. Besides, contrary to the allegations of Causing, none of the elements of constructive dismissal is present.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the instant appeal of Elsie B. Causing is DISMISSED. Office Order No. 12. Dated May 28, 2010 and Office Orders No. 17 and 17-A dated June 01, 2010 of Mayor Hernan D. Biron, Sr. of Barotac Nuevo, Iloilo are AFFIRMED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></blockquote><br>Considering that reassignment was not prohibited by the <i>Omnibus Election Code,</i> there was no probable cause to criminally charge Mayor Biron with the violation of the <i>Omnibus Election Code</i>.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court <b>DISMISSES</b> the petition for certiorari; AFFIRMS the Resolution of the Commission on Elections promulgated on September 9, 2011 dismissing E.O.
