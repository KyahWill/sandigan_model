				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The Regional Governor of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao has the power to appoint officers in the region's civil service. However, if there is no regional law providing for the qualifications for the position at the time of appointment, the appointee must satisfy the civil service eligibilities required for the position in the national government to be appointed in a permanent capacity.<br><br>This is a petition for review on certiorari<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals' resolution,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dismissing the appeal of the Civil Service Commission Regional Office for the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (Regional Office) for failure to file a memorandum.

Hussin (Regional Governor Hussin), then Regional Governor of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, appointed Dr. Sangcad D. Benito (Dr. Benito) as Assistant Schools Division Superintendent of the Department of Education, Division of Lanao del Sur-I, in a temporary capacity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> On June 20, 2005, Regional Governor Hussin reappointed Dr. Benito as Assistant Schools Division Superintendent, this time in a permanent capacity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>To change the status of Dr. Benito's appointment from temporary to permanent, Regional Governor Hussin requested the Civil Service Commission Regional Office for the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao to attest to Dr. Benito's permanent appointment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> However, the Regional Office, through Regional Director Anacleto B. Buena, Jr. (Regional Director Buena), returned the appointment to the Regional Governor. According to the Regional Office, Dr. Benito did not possess the career executive service eligibility required for the position of Assistant Schools Division Superintendent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On August 24, 2005, Dr. Benito filed a petition for mandamus<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> with the Regional Trial Court, Branch 9, Lanao del Sur, to compel the Regional Office to attest to his permanent appointment as Assistant Schools Division Superintendent. He argued that the position does not belong to the Career Executive Service under Book V, Title I, Subtitle A, Chapter 2, Section 7(3) of the Administrative Code of 1987.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Consequently, the position of Assistant Schools Division Superintendent does not require career executive service eligibility.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Dr. Benito claimed that it was the Regional Office's ministerial duty to attest to his appointment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Under Article VII, Section 19 of Republic Act No. 9054,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> the Regional Governor of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao is the appointing authority for positions in the civil service in the region. Since the appointing authority already exercised his discretion, the Regional Office allegedly had no choice but to attest to Dr. Benito's appointment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>In his answer,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Regional Director Buena claimed that the position of Assistant Schools Division Superintendent meets the following criteria for positions in the Career Executive Service: The position is career, ranks higher than Division Chief, has a salary grade of 25, and entails performance of executive and managerial functions and supervisory responsibility over a division.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The permanent appointee to the position must, therefore, have career executive service eligibility.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>According to Regional Director Buena, the Regional Office recognizes the autonomy of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. However, until the region enacts its own regional civil service law, the Regional Office shall carry on with the Civil Service Commission's mandate under the Constitution to promote and enforce civil service laws and rules.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>For Dr. Benito's failure to exhaust administrative remedies before filing a petition for mandamus, Regional Director Buena prayed that the trial court dismiss the petition for mandamus.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>The trial court noted that Dr. Benito did not appeal to the Civil Service Commission proper the Regional Office's refusal to attest to his appointment. Nevertheless, the trial court found that the petition for mandamus, raised a purely legal question. The case, therefore, falls within the exceptions to the rule on exhaustion of administrative remedies.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>As to whether the position of Assistant Schools Division Superintendent requires career executive service eligibility, the trial court held that it did not. Under Civil Service Commission Resolution No. 021011 dated August 1, 2002, only "director positions" in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao require career executive service eligibility. Considering that the Career Executive Service Board had not declared the position of Assistant Schools Division Superintendent a director position, the trial court ruled that the position does not require career executive service eligibility.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> The Regional Office "ha[d] no choice but to attest to [Dr. Benito's] appointment in accordance with Civil Service Laws."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Thus, in the decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> dated September 12, 2005, the trial court granted Dr. Benito's petition for mandamus. It ordered the Civil Service Commission Regional Office for the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao to attest to the permanent appointment of Dr. Benito as Assistant Schools Division Superintendent of the Department of Education, Division of Lanao del Sur-I.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>In the meantime, Regional Director Buena retired.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> The Regional Office, through Regional Director Grace R. Belgado-Saqueton, thus, filed a motion for reconsideration, which the trial court denied in its order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> dated May 19, 2006. The notice of appeal<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> filed was initially denied due course in the order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> dated August 16, 2006. On reconsideration, the trial court reversed itself and granted the Regional Office's notice of appeal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals took cognizance of the appeal. On November 8, 2006, the Court of Appeals directed the parties to file their respective memoranda.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Dr. Benito filed his memorandum<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> on December 27, 2006.

Thus, in the resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> dated June 8, 2007, the Court of Appeals declared the Regional Office's appeal abandoned and dismissed:<br><br><blockquote>While We could have granted CSC's prayer for an additional period, per JRD Report dated April 12, 2007 however, no Memorandum for the appellant was filed as per docket book entry. Consequently, considering that appellant is the initiator of the instant appeal, We are constrained to dismiss the same pursuant to Section 3, Rule 17; Section 10, Rule 44; and Section l(e), Rule 50 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.<br><br>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the instant appeal is hereby deemed ABANDONED and DISMISSED pursuant to Section 3, Rule 17; Section 10, Rule 44; and Section l(e), Rule 50 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></blockquote><br>The Regional Office, through the Office of the Solicitor General, filed a motion for reconsideration. The Associate Solicitor handling the case assumed responsibility for the non-filing of the memorandum, citing her alleged heavy workload as an excuse. She subsequently filed the required memorandum on behalf of the Regional Office.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>In his comment on the motion for reconsideration, Dr. Benito argued that the delay of seven (7) months and 22 days in the filing of the memorandum was inexcusable negligence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>In the resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> dated January 14, 2008, the Court of Appeals denied the Regional Office's motion for reconsideration.<br><br>On April 1, 2008, the Regional Office filed a petition for review on certiorari<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> on which Dr. Benito commented.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> A reply<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> to the comment was filed.

The parties were likewise required to signify their interest in resolving the legal matters in this case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Dr. Benito filed the compliance<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> dated August 20, 2012, on which the Regional Office commented.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>In the petition for review on certiorari for the Regional Office, the Associate Solicitor handling the case pleads for this court's "kind understanding on her human limitations as a government lawyer handling numerous cases."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> She contends that "[the Regional Office] should not be made to bear the prejudice on account of [her] failure to submit the required memorandum."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>The Regional Office argues that the trial court erred in taking cognizance of respondent Dr. Benito's petition for mandamus. A petition for mandamus, according to the Regional Office, is filed only when there is no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. In this case, appeal to the Civil Service Commission proper was still available. Worse, the petition for mandamus was allegedly filed as a substitute for a lost appeal. Consequently, the Regional Office's action on the attestation had already become final and executory, "bar[ring] . . . resort to any judicial action."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> The trial court should not have entertained the petition for mandamus.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>On the merits, petitioner Regional Director Buena maintains that the position of Assistant Schools Division Superintendent requires career executive service eligibility, citing Civil Service Commission Resolution No. 021011<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> dated August 1, 2002. Since the resolution does not distinguish between a holder of a government position in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao and one in a regular agency of the national government, the qualifications for positions in the national government must apply to positions in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>In his comment, respondent Dr. Benito emphasizes that the Regional Office took seven (7) months and 22 days to file a memorandum with the Court of Appeals.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> He argues that the failure of petitioner Regional Director Buena's counsel to file the memorandum is inexcusable negligence. Consequently, the negligence of petitioner Regional Director Buena's counsel binds the Regional Office.<br><br>In his compliance<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> dated August 20, 2012, respondent Dr. Benito added that the issuance of Civil Service Commission Resolution No. 100623 and, subsequently, the Regional Assembly's enactment of the Muslim Mindanao Autonomy Act No. 279 or the ARMM Basic Education Act of 2010 confirm that the position of Assistant Schools Division Superintendent does not require career executive service eligibility.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>The issues for our resolution are the following:<br><br><ol type="I"><li>Whether the Court of Appeals erred in dismissing the Civil Service Commission Regional Office for the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao's appeal for its failure to file the required memorandum;<br><br></li><li>Whether respondent Dr. Benito correctly availed himself of a petition for mandamus against the Civil Service Commission's refusal to attest to his appointment; and<br><br></li><li>Whether the position of Assistant Schools Division Superintendent requires career executive service eligibility.</li></ol><br>We rule for the Civil Service Commission Regional Office.<br><br><center><b>I</b><br></center><br><b>The Court of Appeals did not err in <br>dismissing the Civil Service Commission's<br>appeal for failure to file the required <br>memorandum </b><br><br>Failure to comply with the Rules or with any order of the court is a ground to dismiss the action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Specifically on the appellant's failure to file a memorandum with the Court of Appeals, Rule 44, Section 10 of the Rules of Civil Procedure provides:<br><br><blockquote><b>SEC. 10. <i>Time for filing memoranda in special cases. </i></b>— In <i>certiorari,</i> prohibition, <i>mandamus, quo warranto</i> and <i>habeas corpus</i> cases, the parties shall file, in lieu of briefs, their respective memoranda within a non-extendible period of thirty (30) days from receipt of the notice issued by the clerk that, all evidence, oral and documentary, is already attached to the record.<br><br>The failure of the appellant to file his memorandum within the period therefor may be a ground for dismissal of the appeal.</blockquote><br>Rule 50, Section 1 reiterates that the appellant's failure to file the required memorandum within the reglementary period is a ground for the Court of Appeals to dismiss the appeal:<br><br><blockquote><b>SECTION 1. <i>Grounds for dismissal of appeal.</i></b>— An appeal may be dismissed by the Court of Appeals, on its motion or on that of the appellee, on the following grounds:<br><br>. . . .<br><br>(e) Failure of the appellant to serve and file the required number of copies of his brief or memorandum within the time provided by these Rules[.]</blockquote><br>In this case, the Court of Appeals ordered the parties to file their respective memoranda. Instead of filing the memorandum, the Regional Office requested additional 30 days to file the pleading. The additional period requested lapsed without the Regional Office filing the required memorandum. The Court of Appeals, therefore, correctly dismissed the appeal.<br><br>That "the case was not properly calendared in the list of due dates of the . . .

We have ruled that heavy workload is no excuse for failure to comply with the reglementary periods under the Rules.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>Nevertheless, considering the important question before us, we take cognizance of the petition and resolve the case on the merits.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br><center><b>II</b></center><br><br><b>A petition for mandamus is the proper<br>remedy to compel the Civil Service Commission<br>to attest to the appointment of respondent</b><br><br>Under Rule 65, Section 3 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, a petition for mandamus may be filed when any tribunal, corporation, board, officer, or person unlawfully neglects the performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station. It may also be filed when any tribunal, corporation, board, officer, or person unlawfully excludes another from the use and enjoyment of a right or office to which such other is entitled.<br><br>For mandamus to lie, the act sought to be enjoined must be a ministerial act or duty.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> An act is ministerial if the act should be performed "[under] a given state of facts, in a prescribed manner, in obedience to the mandate of a legal authority, without regard to or the exercise of [the tribunal or corporation's] own judgment upon the propriety or impropriety of the act done."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> The tribunal, corporation, board, officer, or person must have no choice but to perform the act specifically enjoined by law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> This is opposed to a discretionary act wherein the officer has the choice to decide how or when to perform the duty.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>In the context of attestation of appointments in the civil service, this court has ruled that the Civil Service Commission's attestation is a ministerial duty once it finds the appointee eligible for the position.

Given his claim that he possesses the required civil service eligibility for the position of Assistant Schools Division Superintendent, he correctly filed a petition for mandamus to compel the Civil Service Commission to approve his appointment.<br><br>The Regional Office argues that respondent Dr. Benito availed himself of the wrong remedy considering that the plain, speedy, and adequate remedy of appeal to the Civil Service Commission proper was still available. The trial court should have dismissed respondent Dr. Benito's petition for mandamus.<br><br>True, the general rule is that there be no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law when filing a petition for mandamus.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> Moreover, the rule on exhaustion of administrative remedies requires that a party "exhaust all administrative remedies to give the administrative agency an opportunity to decide the matter and to prevent unnecessary and premature resort to the courts."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> The Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> then effective when Dr. Benito was appointed, states:<br><br><blockquote><i>Section 71.

(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Nevertheless, there are exceptions to the rule on exhaustion of administrative remedies. A party may directly resort to judicial remedies if any of the following is present:<br><br><blockquote>1. when there is a violation of due process;<br><br>2. when the issue involved is purely a legal question;<br><br>3. when the administrative action is patently illegal amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction;<br><br>4. when there is estoppel on the part of the administrative agency concerned;<br><br>5. when there is irreparable injury;<br><br>6. when the respondent is a department secretary whose acts as an alter ego of the President bear the implied and assumed approval of the latter;<br><br>7. when to require exhaustion of administrative remedies would be unreasonable;<br><br>8. when it would amount to a nullification of a claim;<br><br>9. when the subject matter is a private land in land case proceedings;<br><br>10. when the rule does not provide a plain, speedy and adequate remedy; and<br><br>11. when there are circumstances indicating the urgency of judicial intervention.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br></blockquote><br>In this case, the facts are undisputed. Respondent Dr. Benito is not career executive service eligible. The question is whether the position for which he was appointed requires career executive service eligibility.

He, therefore, cannot be appointed to the position of Assistant Schools Division Superintendent in a permanent capacity. The Civil Service Commission cannot be compelled to attest to the permanent appointment of respondent Dr. Benito.<br><br>The Regional Governor has the power to appoint civil servants in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao under Article VII, Section 19 of Republic Act No. 9054.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> In Muslim Mindanao Autonomy Act No. 279 or the ARMM Basic Education Act of 2010, the Regional Assembly set the qualification standards of Assistant Schools Division Superintendents of Divisions of the Department of Education in the Autonomous Region:<br><br><blockquote><b>Sec. 45. Qualification Standards of Schools Division Superintendent and Assistant Schools Division Superintendent.</b> No person maybe appointed Schools Division Superintendent or Assistant Schools Division Superintendent unless he is natural born citizen of the Philippines; a native inhabitant of the Autonomous Region; a registered voter in any province or city in the region for at least five years prior to his appointment.<br><br>. . . The Assistant Schools Division Superintendent, at the time of his appointment, shall at least be a Master's Degree holder; five years of supervisory and administrative experiences; with relevant trainings; and possesses appropriate civil service eligibility.<br><br>. . . .</blockquote><br>Nevertheless, when respondent Dr. Benito was appointed Assistant Schools Division Superintendent in 2005, there was yet no regional law providing for the qualifications for the Assistant Schools Division Superintendents of Divisions of the Department of Education in the Autonomous Region. Consequently, the civil service eligibilities required for positions in the national government shall likewise be required for appointments to positions in the Autonomous Region. Article XVI, Section 4 of Republic Act No. 9054 provides:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 4. <i>Civil Service Eligibility</i>. - Until the Regional Assembly shall have enacted a civil service law, the civil service eligibilities required by the central government or national government for appointments to public positions shall likewise be required for appointments to government positions in the Regional Government. As may be necessary, the Civil Service Commission shall hold special civil service examinations in the autonomous region. For a period not longer more than six (6) years from the approval of this Organic Act, the central government or national government shall endeavor to provide appropriate civil service eligibility to applicants coming from the autonomous region for government positions therein. The minimum qualifications prescribed by law shall, however, be met.</blockquote><br>All told, respondent Dr. Benito did not possess the required civil service eligibility at the time he was appointed Assistant Schools Division Superintendent. Consequently, he cannot be appointed in a permanent capacity to the position. The Civil Service Commission cannot be compelled through a writ of mandamus to attest to the permanent appointment of respondent Dr. Benito.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for review on certiorari is <b>GRANTED</b>.
