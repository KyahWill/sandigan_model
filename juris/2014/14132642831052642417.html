In such case the contract is called a suretyship.</blockquote><br>In <i>Stronghold Insurance Company v. Tokyu Construction Company</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br><blockquote>A contract of suretyship is an agreement whereby a party, called the surety, guarantees the performance by another party, called the principal or obligor, of an obligation or undertaking in favor of another party, called the obligee. By its very nature, under the laws regulating suretyship, the liability of the surety is joint and several but is limited to the amount of the bond, and its terms are determined strictly by the terms of the contract of suretyship in relation to the principal contract between the obligor and the obligee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></blockquote><br>In <i>American Home Insurance Co. v.

Their liabilities are so interwoven as to be inseparable. Although the contract of suretyship is, in essence, secondary only to a valid principal obligation, the surety’s liability to the creditor is direct, primary, and absolute; he becomes liable for the debt and duty of another although he possesses no direct or personal interest over the obligations nor does he receive any benefit therefrom.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></blockquote><br>In this case, the surety bond was executed “to guarantee the repayment of the downpayment”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> and “to secure the full and faithful performance”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> of Million State Development.&nbsp; According to the terms of the bond, People’s General Insurance bound itself to be liable in the amount of P10,000,000.00 in the event that Million State Development defaults in its obligations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Petitioner, however, contends that the inclusion of the clause “or the Project Owner’s waiver” in Article XIII of the signed agreement made its obligations more onerous and, therefore, the surety must be released from its bond.<br><br>A suretyship consists of two different contracts: (1) the surety contract and (2) the principal contract which it guarantees.&nbsp; Since the insurer’s liability is strictly based only on the terms stated in the surety contract in relation to the principal contract, any change in the principal contract, which materially alters the principal’s obligations would, in effect, constitute an implied novation of the surety contract:<br><br>[A] surety is released from its obligation when there is a material alteration of the contract in connection with which the bond is given, such as a change which imposes a new obligation on the promising party, or which takes away some obligation already imposed, or one which changes the legal effect of the original contract and not merely its form.&nbsp; A surety, however, is not released by a change in the contract which does not have the effect of making its obligation more onerous.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Petitioner insists that the principal contract of the suretyship was the draft agreement since it was assured by its principal that the draft would embody the same terms and conditions as the final signed agreement.&nbsp; The insertion of the disputed clause in the signed agreement, it argues, “effectively deprived petitioner of the opportunity to objectively assess the real risk of its undertaking and fix the reasonable rate of premium thereon.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>This argument is unmeritorious.<br><br>In his testimony before the trial court, Mr. Liboro, representing petitioner, admitted that the signed copy of the agreement was attached to the surety bond when it was returned to them by Million State Development and respondent:<br><br><blockquote>ATTY. PEREZ:&nbsp; Do I get it correct Mr. Witness that after the contract was finalize[d], it was attached to the bond and returned to you?<br><br>A:&nbsp; Yes, it was returned to us together with the attachment.<br><br>ATTY. PEREZ:&nbsp; So, that was maybe if the payment was made on March 3, 1999 about March 4, 1999 [sic] you have a copy of the final draft already? It was attached to your bond?<br><br>A:&nbsp; It was attached to our copy of the bond.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Mr. Liboro also admitted that they were not diligent in reviewing the documents presented to them and merely relied on their principal’s assurances of the content of the documents:<br><br><blockquote>ATTY. PEREZ:<br><br>Q:&nbsp; Is that normal procedure in your company that you evaluate an application on the basis of a mere draft?<br><br>WITNESS:<br><br>A:&nbsp; Draft is for us to study whether we can accept or not. In fact, that is the first requirement you have the contract submitted and we have to study, but once the bond is to be issued, there are some other requirements that you have to comply with. That is the initial requirement.<br><br>Q:&nbsp; But do you remember having mentioned that it came to your knowledge that the final signed contract agreement between Million State Development Corporation and the Doctors of New Millennium happened two (2) days after you issued the bond?<br><br>A:&nbsp; No, only one (1) day. In fact I did not even observe until later on when they were reviewing this bond, from the lawyer “<i>pa nanggaling yon; hindi naman napupuna iyon eh</i>.” I have trust and confidence that the final draft was the same draft that was drafted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></blockquote><br>Petitioner, as the surety, had the responsibility to read through the terms of the principal contract; it cannot simply rely on the assurances of its principal.&nbsp; It was petitioner’s duty to carefully scrutinize the agreement since the Insurance Code mandates that its liability is determined strictly in accordance with the provisions of the principal contract:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 176.&nbsp; The liability of the surety or sureties shall be joint and several with the obligor and shall be limited to the amount of the bond.&nbsp; It is determined strictly by the terms of the contract of suretyship in relation to the principal contract between the obligor and the obligee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></blockquote><br>If petitioner had any objection to the terms of the signed agreement, it could have pointed it out before its principal defaults and it becomes liable under the surety bond.&nbsp; The silence of petitioner must be taken against it since it was responsible for exerting diligence in the conduct of its affairs.<br><br>Even the Insurance Commission was aware that petitioner acted irresponsibly when it issued the surety bond:<br><br><blockquote>This Commission, however, took notice of the laxity or irresponsible underwriting practice of respondent insurance company’s bond underwriter when the latter did not require a collateral security for this kind of bond considering that the business of suretyship is a very risky one. It would have been easier for respondent company to settle the claim had there been a collateral given by the principal when the latter defaulted from the obligation under the contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></blockquote><br>Petitioner’s failure to notice the changes in the signed agreement was due to its own fault and not to any deception on the part of respondent.&nbsp; Respondent was not privy to the terms of the surety bond entered into by petitioner and Million State Development.&nbsp; If there were any changes in the contract that petitioner should have been aware of, it was Million State Development, as its principal, which had the duty to inform them about the changes.<br><br>On the basis of petitioner’s own admissions, the principal contract of the suretyship is the signed agreement.&nbsp; The surety, therefore, is presumed to have acquiesced to the terms and conditions embodied in the principal contract when it issued its surety bond.&nbsp; Accordingly, petitioner cannot argue that the insertion of the clause in the signed agreement constituted an implied novation of the obligation which extinguished its obligations as a surety since there was nothing to novate:<br><br><blockquote>[I]n order that an obligation may be extinguished by another which substitutes the same, it is imperative that it be so declared in unequivocal terms, or that the old and new obligation be in every point incompatible with each other. Novation of a contract is never presumed. In the absence of an express agreement, novation takes place only when the old and the new obligations are incompatible on every point.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Even if we were to assume, for the sake of argument, that the principal contract in the suretyship was the draft agreement, the addition of the clause “or the Project Owner’s waiver” in the signed agreement does not operate as a novation of petitioner’s liability under the surety bond.<br><br><b>The disputed clause is not material<br>to People’s General Insurance’s <br>undertaking to guarantee Doctors of <br>New Millennium’s initial payment</b><br><br>Respondent’s waiver of the conditions set forth under Article XIII of the agreement does not substantially or materially alter petitioner’s obligation to guarantee the performance of its principal, Million State Development. Article XIII states:<br><br><blockquote><center>ARTICLE XIII<br><br>CONDITIONS TO DISBURSEMENT OF INITIAL PAYMENT</center><br>13.1 The obligation of the Project Owner to pay to the Contractor the amount constituting the Initial Payment shall be subject to and shall be made on the date (the “Closing date”) following the fulfillment or the Project Owner’s waiver of the following conditions:<br><br>(a)&nbsp; the approval and selection by the Project Owner of the Subcontractor that shall perform the Works, in accordance with Section 5.1;<br><br>(b) the submission by the Contractor of a breakdown of the phases of the Work to be performed in pursuance of the Project, the corresponding percentage value and weight of each such phase, and a schedule of the Works indicating the chronological order in which the Contractor proposes to carry out such Works, together with the dates on which each phase of work shall be completed (the “Schedule of Work”);<br><br>(c)&nbsp; the submission by the Contractor of a copy of the (Surety Bond) in the form and substance satisfactory to the Project Owner, in accordance with Section 9.1;<br><br>(d) the submission by the Contractor of proof of a firm commitment by banking institution(s) to fund the Project in the form of a committed credit line and representing committed funds in an amount not less than the Contract Price, or such other similar financing arrangements acceptable to the Project Owner; and<br><br>(e)&nbsp; the compliance by the Contractor with all obligations required to be performed by the Contractor as of the Closing Date.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></blockquote><br>These conditions, however, only embody a portion of Million State Development’s obligations to respondent.<br><br>Petitioner, as a surety, bound itself to guarantee the repayment of the initial price in the event that Million State Development fails to perform not only the conditions under Article XIII but all its obligations under the signed agreement.&nbsp; This is clear from the terms of the surety bond:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREAS, the DOCTORS OF NEW MILLENNIUM HOLDINGS, INC. requires the Principal to post a Surety (Downpayment) Bond in the above-stated sum to guarantee the repayment of the downpayment as provided under the terms and conditions of its contract with the obligee, a copy of which is hereto attached and made an integral part of this bond.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup></blockquote><br>The conditions under Article XIII of the signed agreement refer only to the conditions that Million State Development was responsible for so that initial payment could be disbursed to them.&nbsp; Petitioner failed to take into account that Article XIII must be read together with Article IX, which states:<br><br><blockquote><center>Article IX<br><br>SECURITY FOR CONTRACTOR’S OBLIGATIONS<br></center><br>9.1 Upon receipt of the execution of this Agreement, the Contractor shall deliver to the Project Owner a Surety bond for the amount equal to the Initial Payment of TEN MILLION PESOS (PhP10,000,000.00) secured from Peoples Trans-East Asia Insurance Corporation for the purpose of securing the performance by the Contractor of its obligations in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement as set out in Annex F and shall be valid until the issuance by the Project Owner of the Certificate of Final Acceptance of the Project, provided that the amount available to be drawn under the Surety Bond shall be reduced semi-annually commencing six (6) months from the date of Initial Payment and in proportion to such work, services, materials, supplies and equipment certified by the Project Owner to have been performed, completed or provided during the relevant six month period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></blockquote><br>Article IX requires Million State Development to procure a surety bond to cover the initial payment “upon the execution of the Agreement,” and not upon the fulfillment of the conditions under Article XIII.&nbsp; Any waiver by respondent of the conditions for the release of the initial payment would not affect the conditions by which the surety bond was issued.<br><br>Million State Development’s obligations under the contract subsist regardless of whether respondent waives the conditions for the release of the initial payment.&nbsp; Its obligation upon the release of the initial payment was for it to “make available the funds constituting the Balance Payment . . . [in] the amount of THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY-FIVE MILLION PESOS (PhP385,000,000.00), within twenty-five (25) banking days from payment by the Project Owner of the Initial Payment.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>&nbsp; It is this performance of this obligation that the surety primarily guarantees.<br><br>Even the Insurance Commission arrived at the same conclusion when it found that:<br><br><blockquote>It appears from the provisions of Art. [VII] 7.5 of the Agreement that the initial payment of P10 million serves as a basis and a reckoning for the “Contractor to make available the funds constituting the Balance Payment under the following schedule: a) the amount of P385 million within 25 days from payment by the Project Owner of the Initial Payment xxx.” Considering that the contractor failed to provide for the Balance Payment on the prescribed due date, he has the obligation to return what he has received so as not to unjustly enrich himself at the expense of the other. It can be inferred[,] therefore, that the undertaking pertains to the return of the initial payment of P10 million.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup></blockquote><br>Petitioner cannot feign ignorance of Million State Development’s obligation to provide the funds for the balance since this provision was present in both the draft agreement and the signed agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup>&nbsp; Since Million State Development failed to fulfill its obligation, the surety becomes jointly and severally liable for the amount of the bond.<br><br><b>The award of attorney’s fees must be deleted</b><br><br>The trial court and the Court of Appeals awarded attorney’s fees to respondent without giving any factual or legal basis for the award.&nbsp; The award merely appeared on the dispositive portion of the lower court’s rulings without explanation or justification.<br><br>As we have stated in <i>Philippine National Construction Corporation v. APAC Marketing Corporation</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br><blockquote>The general rule is that attorney’s fees cannot be recovered as part of damages because of the policy that no premium should be placed on the right to litigate. They are not to be awarded every time a party wins a suit. The power of the court to award attorney’s fees under Article 2208<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> demands factual, legal, and equitable justification. Even when a claimant is compelled to litigate with third persons or to incur expenses to protect his rights, still attorney’s fees may not be awarded where no sufficient showing of bad faith could be reflected in a party’s persistence in a case other than an erroneous conviction of the righteousness of his cause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup></blockquote><br>As respondent has not shown any justification as to its award of attorney’s fees, the same must be deleted.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.&nbsp; The decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
