The Legal Office, OCA, be <b>DIRECTED</b> to file the appropriate criminal charges against Mrs. Aurora T. Zuñiga.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></blockquote><b><u>The Court’s Ruling</u></b><br><br>After a careful examination of the records of this case, the Court finds the recommendation of the OCA to be correct.<br><br>SC Circular Nos. 13-92 and 5-93, as integrated in the 2002 Revised Manual for Clerks of Court, provide the guidelines for the accounting of court funds. All fiduciary collections upon receipt shall be deposited immediately by the Clerk of Court concerned with an authorized government depository bank. In SC Circular No. 5-93, the LBP was designated as the authorized government depository.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Furthermore, Section B(4) of Circular No. 50-95<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> directs that all collections from bailbonds, rental deposits and other fiduciary collections shall be deposited with the LBP within twenty-four (24) hours by the Clerk of Court concerned as instructed in Circular No. 13-92.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Zuñiga, as Clerk of Court, was entrusted with the delicate functions of collecting legal fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> She acted as cashier and disbursement officer of the court and was tasked to collect and receive all monies paid as legal fees, deposits, fines and dues, and controls the disbursement of the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> She was also designated as custodian of the court’s funds and revenues, records, properties and premises, and should be liable for any loss or shortage thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Zuñiga, however, failed to properly account for her FF collections and to judiciously deposit the same with the Land Bank within twenty-four (24) hours upon receipt. She was also unable to explain the shortage of P269,363.35 from her July 10, 2007-March 31, 2008 transactions. Moreover, she failed to provide proper documentation to completely support the cash bond withdrawals amounting to P232,860.00 spanning from June 26, 1992 to December 31, 1995 which she claimed to have been refunded to bondsmen/litigants. Circular No. 50-95 provides for the guidelines on how to make withdrawals from the court fiduciary funds, to wit:<br><blockquote><u>B. Guideline in Making Withdrawals</u>:<br><br>(1) Withdrawal slips shall be signed by the Executive/Presiding Judge and countersigned by the Clerk of Court.<br><br>(2) No withdrawals, except as specifically provided in the immediately preceding paragraph, shall be allowed unless there is a lawful order from the Court that has jurisdiction over the subject matter involved.<br><br>(3) When maintaining a current account, withdrawals shall be made by check. Signatures on the check shall likewise be the Executive/Presiding Judge and the Clerk of Court.<br></blockquote>As can be gleaned from the said provision, supporting documents such as a court order from the judge authorizing the withdrawal and acknowledgment receipts of the bondsmen or litigants must be fully presented. Failure to strictly comply with these requirements would make the withdrawals unauthorized. Thus, after recomputation, Zuñiga still had a shortage of P134,050.00 representing unauthorized FF withdrawals due to insufficient documentation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>As observed by the financial audit team, there were also instances when Zuñiga failed to deposit her JDF collections within twenty-four (24) hours upon receipt. She deferred the deposit of her JDF collections for another day or the succeeding month without any valid justification.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Due to this unconventional method, the interest on the FF account was erroneously receipted and deposited in the GF account.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Clearly, Zuñiga’s unorganized method of managing and documenting the cash collections allocated for the JDF was a serious violation of Administrative Circular No. 5-93, the pertinent portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>3. Duty of the Clerks of Court, Officers-in-Charge or accountable officers.-The Clerks of Court, Officers-in-Charge of the Office of the Clerk of Court, or their accountable duly authorized representative designated by them in writing, who must be accountable officers, shall receive the Judiciary Development Fund collections, issue the proper receipt therefor, maintain a separate cash book properly marked CASH BOOK FOR JUDICIARY DEVELOPMENT FUND, deposit such collections in the manner herein prescribed, and render the proper Monthly Report of Collections for said Fund.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br></blockquote>More importantly, delayed remittance of cash collections constitutes gross neglect of duty because this omission deprives the court of interest that may be earned if the amounts were to be deposited in the authorized depository bank. SC Circular No. 13-92 requires clerks of court to withdraw interest earned on deposits and to remit the same to the account of the JDF within two (2) weeks after the end of each quarter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Delay in the remittance of court’s funds casts a serious doubt on the concerned court employee’s trustworthiness and integrity. As ruled in <i>In Re: Report on the Judicial and Financial Audit of RTC-Br. 4, Panabo, Davao del Norte</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> and <i>Office of the Court Administrator v. Recio</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> the failure of the Clerk of Court to remit the court funds was tantamount to gross neglect of duty, dishonesty and grave misconduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service.<br><br>It need not be overemphasized that court personnel tasked with collections of court funds, such as the clerk of court and cash clerks, should deposit immediately with the authorized government depositories the various funds they had collected. Being the custodian of court funds and revenues, Zuñiga had the primary responsibility to immediately deposit the funds received by her office with the authorized government depositories and not to keep the same in her custody.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>The Court cannot accept Zuñiga’s argument that she already made the appropriate restitution because it was not supported by evidence. Zuñiga posits that she personally gave the money to her presiding judge to answer for her accountabilities on July 9, 2007,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> but it was only in 2008 that the financial audit team examined her books of account. Besides, a claim of payment is just a self-serving allegation and mere allegation of payment without proof merits no weight. In fact, Judge Santiago-Ubalde belied this claim in her letter,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> dated September 21, 2010, when she specifically mentioned that Zuñiga did not make any restitution whatsoever. She also dragged the names of her other co-workers in her predicament, but passing the blame to another with no credible explanation would not suffice to absolve her from liability.<br><br>Remarkably, Zuñiga’s present stand is contrary to what she wrote in her previous letter,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> dated April 11, 2008, when she informed the audit team of her intention to fully restitute her accountabilities. In fact, in her other letter, dated March 9, 2009, she openly admitted that she used the money collected as bail to pay for her own expenses and household bills. Thus:<br><blockquote>There were also times when I gave the bail amount to the designated collecting officer <i>or at times, divided the amount because we both needed the money to buy food or pay the house bills</i>. However, much to my dismay, she negated my story because according to her, she did not sign any receipt when she received the money.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br></blockquote>Her incongruous statements do not reflect highly on her character as a public servant; they constitute gross dishonesty, which undermines the public’s faith in courts and in the administration of justice as a whole.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>In fact, Zuñiga’s unjustified failure to comply with the Court’s circulars designed to promote full accountability for public funds even constitutes gross neglect of duty and grave misconduct.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> No protestation of good faith can override the mandatory observance of court circulars.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> It should be emphasized that the 2002 Revised Manual for Clerks of Court requires strict compliance with the rules and regulations of the collection and accounting funds, thus:<br><blockquote>2.1.2.4 Sanctions<br><br>Strict observance of the rules and regulations on collection and accounting of funds is hereby enjoined. The Clerks of Court or Officers-in-Charge shall exercise close supervision over their respective duly authorized representatives to ensure strict compliance herewith, and shall be held administratively accountable for failure to do so. <i>Failure to comply with any of these rules and regulations shall mean the withholding of the salaries and allowances of those concerned until compliance thereof is duly effected, pursuant to Sec. 122 of Pres Decree No. 1445 dated June 11, 1978, without prejudice to such further disciplinary action the Court may take against them</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> [Emphases supplied]<br></blockquote>Section 1, Article XI of the Constitution, provides that a public office is a public trust, and all public officers and employees must at all times be accountable to the people; serve them with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty, and efficiency; act with patriotism and justice; and lead modest lives. The demand for moral uprightness is more pronounced for the members and personnel of the Judiciary who are involved in the dispensation of justice. The conduct of court members and personnel must not only be characterized with propriety and decorum but must also be above suspicion, for any act of impropriety can seriously erode or diminish the people’s confidence in the Judiciary. As frontliners in the administration of justice, they should live up to the strictest standards of honesty and integrity in the public service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Thus, applying the parameters set forth by the 2002 Revised Manual for Clerks of Court and various court circulars, there is no doubt that Zuñiga is guilty of gross dishonesty. Section 52, Rule IV of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> classifies gross dishonesty as a grave offense with the corresponding penalty of dismissal for the first offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Equally, the maximum penalty of dismissal from service for gross dishonesty is provided in Section 9, Rule XIV of the Civil Service Rules:<br><blockquote>The penalty of dismissal shall carry with it cancellation of eligibility, forfeiture of leave credits and retirement benefits, and the disqualification for reemployment in the government service. Further, it may be imposed without prejudice to criminal or civil liability.<br></blockquote>Indeed, a public servant is expected to exhibit, at all times, the highest degree of honesty and integrity, and should be made accountable to all those whom he serves. There is no place in the Judiciary for those who cannot meet the exacting standards of judicial conduct and integrity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, finding respondent Aurora T.
