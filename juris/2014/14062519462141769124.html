Maria Apartment, India St., Better Living Subdivision, Barangay Don Bosco, Parañaque City.<br><br>Having been convinced by the documents shown to him at the Taft Avenue office, [De Guzman] paid [Daud] the amount of P35,000[.]00 as initial payment for his placement fee at the latter’s office and residence in Parañaque City on February 2, 2001.&nbsp; On February 5, 2001, [De Guzman] gave [Daud] the amount of P15,000[.]00 which was witnessed by Hanelita.&nbsp; He gave another P15,000.00 on February 22, 2001.&nbsp; However, he lost the original receipts.<br><br>On March 3, 6 and 7, 2001, [De Guzman] again gave [Daud] x x x different amounts consisting of P35,000.00, P30,000.00 and P15,000.00, respectively, at her office in Parañaque City (Exhibits “A” to “C”).&nbsp; In [De Guzman]’s presence, [Daud] counted the money, issued receipts therefor as “processing fees of Nike applicants”, affixed her signature after signing the receipts in the name of “Nimfa Min”.&nbsp; [Daud] explained to him that “Nimfa Min” was her contact who happened to be the wife of a Korean national.&nbsp; [De Guzman] trusted [Daud] and accepted her explanation.&nbsp; Whenever he gave his payment to [Daud], it was in the presence of Hanelita and [appellant] but he did not require the two to sign as witnesses because he trusted them as they were members of the same family.&nbsp; [De Guzman] was told by [Daud] and [appellant] that he and his group would be leaving in two week’s time.<br><br>[De Guzman] and his companions were instructed to appear before the Korean Embassy and were promised that they would be able to leave on March 11, 2001 as trainee workers in Korea where they would earn a monthly salary of US$400, overtime pay, with benefits of free board and lodging and 30-day leave within a year.&nbsp; De Guzman’s group were shown photocopies of their passport and stamped visas for Korea.&nbsp; However, they were not given their working permits and job contracts.<br><br>When their departure date was getting near, [Daud] postponed it thrice.&nbsp; Eventually, [De Guzman] asked from accused [Daud] a photocopy of his passport with a stamped Korean Visa.&nbsp; Upon inquiry with the Korean Embassy, [De Guzman] was told that it was fake.&nbsp; He proceeded to the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) and verified the registration of Green Pastures Worldwide Tour and Consultancy Corporation.&nbsp; The POEA informed them that it was not registered with the POEA and gave [De Guzman] a certification to the effect that the said agency was not licensed to recruit employees for abroad (Exhibit D).<br><br>Embarrassed because of the money given by his cousins, [De Guzman] verbally asked [Daud], Hanelita and [appellant] to return the money.&nbsp; They promised him that they would settle the matter but they failed to return the money. x x x.<br><br><b>Gina Decena</b>, for her part testified that sometime in January 2001, she was introduced by her cousin, Maricel Rayo, to accused [Daud], [Hanelita] and [appellant], at the Makati Medical Towers where Maricel had her medical examination.&nbsp; [Decena] again met the three accused at their office at No. 4 Sta. Maria Apartment, Better Living Subdivision, Parañaque City when Maricel obtained a copy of her medical certificate.&nbsp; They enticed [Decena] to apply at their agency by showing her job orders that offered $400 [a] month salary, 150% overtime pay, free board and lodging as well as photographs of prospective Korean employers.&nbsp; [Appellant] even gave her a copy of the job order.&nbsp; The three accused assured [Decena] that they had already sent several applicants for employment abroad.&nbsp; Convinced, [Decena] and her husband Marcelo Rayo applied at their agency.&nbsp; They were instructed to undergo medical examination, to attend a Korean Language seminar, and to pay P70,000.00 processing fee.<br><br>Thus, on February 15, 2001, [Decena] and her husband each gave accused [Daud] the amount of P35,000.00 as placement fees.&nbsp; During trial, [Decena] presented her receipt for P35,000.00 which was received and signed by [Daud].<br><br>Thereafter, the couple were told to wait for two weeks for the processing of their visas.&nbsp; As two weeks have passed and nothing happened to their applications, [Decena] and her husband went to the POEA to verify the status of the agency.&nbsp; They were informed to the effect that said agency was not licensed to send workers abroad.&nbsp; [Decena] and her husband went back to the agency and tried to look for the accused but they were all gone.&nbsp; They later came to know, through [De Guzman], that [appellant] was apprehended.&nbsp; She identified her sworn statement in court.<br><br>Sometime in January 2001, <b>Francisco Poserio </b>[(Poserio)] was brought along by his cousin [De Guzman] to No. 4 Sta. Maria Apt., India St., Better Living Subdivision, Barangay Don Bosco, Parañaque City.&nbsp; While thereat, [De Guzman] introduced [Daud], Hanelita and [appellant] as the owners of Green Pastures Worldwide Tours and Consultancy and that they were sending workers to Korea.&nbsp; The three accused encouraged [Poserio] to apply for work in Korea where he could get a job which offered a monthly salary of US$400 with free meals and housing, 150% pay on overtime work and vacation leave of thirty (30) days in a two-year contract.&nbsp; To convince [Poserio] that they can send workers to Korea, they showed him job orders from Hyundai Group and Nike requiring workers for Korea, a copy of a Korean visa of one of their job applicants, and photos of [Daud] in Korea with a Korean national who would be [Poserio]’s prospective employer if he applied with their agency.&nbsp; Further, he would be able to earn back his placement fee in three months work.<br><br>Enticed, [Poserio] mortgaged his property to get funds for his job application.&nbsp; [Daud] and Hanelita informed him to undergo a medical examination and seminar and even gave him a referral.&nbsp; On January 27, 2001, he gave his passport, medical examination result, seminar result and certification for employment.&nbsp; He was then told to pay P100,000.00 as processing fee for his job application.&nbsp; On March 3, 2001, he gave his downpayment of P25,000.00 to [Daud] in the presence of Hanelita and [appellant].&nbsp; He was told to wait for two weeks for the processing of his papers.&nbsp; On July 2001, he was informed that additional amount was needed to process his papers.&nbsp; Thus, on July 5, 2001, he gave P45,000.00 as additional payment to [Daud] in the presence of Hanelita.&nbsp; He was again told to wait for another three weeks.&nbsp; He was even promised that they would return his money if he would not be sent abroad.&nbsp; A year after his payment, [Poserio] was still not able to leave the country.&nbsp; Upon verification with the POEA, he and the other job applicants discovered that the said agency was not licensed to recruit workers for overseas employment.&nbsp; He talked over the phone with the accused and demanded the return of his money.&nbsp; When they failed to return his money, he filed a complaint with the Parañaque police.<br><br>All three complainants positively identified [appellant] in court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> (Citations omitted.)</blockquote><br>The Court of Appeals similarly provided a gist of appellant’s testimony, thus:<br><br><blockquote><b>Roderick Gallemit</b> [(appellant)] denied owning the agency, undertaking any recruitment act or receiving any amount from the complainants considering that his name did not appear in the receipts.&nbsp; He admitted that he is married to co-accused [Hanelita] and that co-accused [Daud] is his mother-in-law.<br><br>He knew private complainants [De Guzman] and [Poserio] who were introduced to him by [Daud] who was then working as a liaison officer at Jemimah International Manpower Services located in Taft Avenue, Manila.&nbsp; [Appellant] denied knowing the other complainants.&nbsp; He was just brought along by [Daud] since he was also one of the job seekers applying at the Jemimah International Manpower Services where [Daud] worked.&nbsp; [Daud] told him that private complainant [De Guzman] is her business partner.&nbsp; [Poserio] was one of those applying for a job abroad and [De Guzman] would refer them to [Daud].&nbsp; Thus, [De Guzman] frequented their apartment in Parañaque.<br><br>He admitted that, from February 2001 to August 2001, he had been staying at the apartment in India Street, Better Living Subdivision, Parañaque City he shared with his wife Hanelita, their child and his mother-in-law [Daud].&nbsp; He and his wife were not employed since they were applying for a job abroad.&nbsp; His siblings help him out by sending him money for his job application.&nbsp; He was aware that his mother-in-law [Daud] was a recruiter and owned an agency named Green Pasture Worldwide Travel and Tours which she operated in the same apartment.&nbsp; He claimed that [Daud] has only one employee, a certain Badjong, who processed documents.&nbsp; At first he did not apply with [Daud] because her business was still new.&nbsp; He applied with her when she convinced him that she could process his passport and papers to Korea.<br><br>He denied he was present when the complainants gave their payments to [Daud].&nbsp; He insisted that he was not involved with [Daud]’s business and that he was always out of the house as he would often go to Cavite to ask for financial help from his siblings. x x x.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> (Citations omitted.)<br></blockquote><br>In its Decision dated March 18, 2011, the Court of Appeals affirmed appellant’s conviction by the RTC, but modified the indeterminate penalties imposed on appellant for the three counts of estafa.&nbsp;

Any encouragement or promise of employment abroad was solely made by Daud.&nbsp; Appellant points out that it was only his alleged presence at the time private complainants were making their payments to Daud that led said private complainants to believe that appellant participated in the recruitment scheme.<br><br>The Office of the Solicitor General, as counsel for the appellee, insists that appellant acted in conspiracy with his co-accused in engaging in illegal recruitment activities, specifically performing the following acts: (1) Appellant, together with his co-accused, owned and operated Green Pasture Worldwide Tour and Consultancy Corporation;

Illegal recruitment when committed by a syndicate or in large scale shall be considered an offense involving economic sabotage.<br><br>Illegal recruitment is deemed committed by a syndicate if carried out by a group of three (3) or more persons conspiring or confederating with one another.&nbsp; It is deemed committed in large scale if committed against three (3) or more persons individually or as a group.</blockquote><br>To constitute illegal recruitment in large scale, three elements must concur:&nbsp; (a) the offender has no valid license or authority required by law to enable him to lawfully engage in recruitment and placement of workers;&nbsp; (b) the offender undertakes any of the activities within the meaning of “recruitment and placement” under Article 13(b) of the Labor Code, or any of the prohibited practices enumerated under Article 34 of the said Code (now Section 6 of Republic Act No. 8042); and (c) the offender committed the same against three or more persons, individually or as a group.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Both the RTC and the Court of Appeals ruled that all the foregoing elements of illegal recruitment in large scale are present in the case at bar.&nbsp; As the Court of Appeals discussed in detail:<br><br><blockquote>First, neither the agency “Green Pastures World Wide Tours and Consultancy” nor appellant himself had a valid license or authority to engage in the recruitment and placement of workers.&nbsp; This was established by the POEA certification stating that the said agency located in that apartment was not licensed to recruit employees for abroad.&nbsp; A license is a document issued by the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) authorizing a person or entity to operate a private employment agency, while an authority is a document issued by the DOLE authorizing a person or association to engage in recruitment and placement activities as a private recruitment entity.&nbsp; It is the lack of the necessary license or authority that renders the recruitment activity, as in this case, unlawful or criminal.<br><br>Second, despite not having such authority, appellant, along with his co-accused, nevertheless engaged in recruitment activities, offering and promising jobs to private complainants and collecting from them various amounts as placement fees.&nbsp; This is substantiated by the respective testimonies of the three private complainants who fell victim to their illegal activities.&nbsp; Marcelo de Guzman testified that appellant was physically present during the time that he and his companions were being shown job orders and while he was paying for the fees for himself and in behalf of his companions.&nbsp; Francisco Poserio testified that appellant was one of those who apprised him of job benefits and tried to convince him to apply for overseas employment through their agency.&nbsp; Gina Decena mentioned that [appellant] even gave her a copy of the job order.<br><br>We find no cogent reason to disturb the findings of the lower court that there was conspiracy among the accused in the commission of the offense.&nbsp; Direct proof of previous agreement to commit a crime is not necessary.&nbsp; It may be deduced from the mode and manner in which the offense was perpetrated, or inferred from the acts of the accused which point to a joint purpose and design, concerted action and community of interest.&nbsp; Conspiracy exists where the participants performed specific acts with such closeness and coordination as unmistakably to indicate a common purpose or design in committing the crime.<br><br>The testimonies of the complainants on the matter are affirmative in nature and sufficiently corroborative of each other to be less than credible. It would be contrary to human nature and experience for several persons to conspire and accuse appellant of a crime and send him to prison just to appease their feeling of rejection and vindicate the frustration of their dreams to work abroad if all he did was just to reside in the same apartment where his mother-in-law [Daud] operated her recruitment agency.&nbsp; It is in this light that We find any inconsistencies that accused-appellant harps on in the tesimonines of the complainants to be inconsequential.&nbsp; What is important is that they have positively identified accused-appellant as one of those who enticed them to part with their money in exchange for promised jobs abroad.<br><br>The crime of illegal recruitment, according to the Supreme Court is committed when, among other things, a person, who without being duly authorized according to law, represents or gives the distinct impression that he or she has the power or the ability to provide work abroad convincing those to whom the representation is made or to whom the impression is given to thereupon part with their money in order to be assured of that employment.&nbsp; This is what obtains in this case.<br><br>Contrary to appellant’s mistaken notion, it is not the issuance or signing of receipts for the placement fees that makes a case for illegal recruitment, but rather the undertaking of recruitment activities without the necessary license or authority.&nbsp; The absence of receipts to evidence payment is not necessarily fatal to the prosecution’s cause.&nbsp; A person charged with the illegal recruitment may be convicted on the strength of the testimony of the complainants, if found to be credible and convincing.<br><br>Considering the evidence on record, We agree with the trial court that accused-appellant engaged in recruitment of workers which was illegal and in large scale.&nbsp; Illegal recruitment is deemed committed in large scale if committed against three or more persons individually or as a group.&nbsp; In this case, three complainants testified against appellant’s acts of illegal recruitment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> (Citations omitted.)</blockquote><br>The Court finds no cogent reason to deviate from the findings and conclusions of the RTC and the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; The prosecution witnesses were positive and categorical in their testimonies that they personally met appellant; that they knew appellant was associated with Green Pasture Worldwide Tour and Consultancy; and that appellant had performed recruitment activities such as promising employment abroad, encouraging job applications, and providing copies of job orders.&nbsp; The private complainants’ testimonies are consistent and corroborate one another on material points, such as the amount of the placement fees asked, and the purported country of destination and nature of work.<br><br>It was not necessary for the prosecution to still prove that appellant himself received the placement fees from private complainants and issued receipts for the same, given the finding of both the RTC and the Court of Appeals of the existence of conspiracy among appellant and his co-accused Hanelita and Daud, appellant’s wife and mother-in-law, respectively.&nbsp; When there is conspiracy, the act of one is the act of all.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; It is not essential that there be actual proof that all the conspirators took a direct part in every act.&nbsp; It is sufficient that they acted in concert pursuant to the same objective.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Between the categorical statements of the private complainants, on the one hand, and the bare denial of appellant, on the other hand, the former must perforce prevail. An affirmative testimony is far stronger than a negative testimony especially when the former comes from the mouth of a credible witness.&nbsp; Denial, same as an alibi, if not substantiated by clear and convincing evidence, is negative and self-serving evidence undeserving of weight in law.&nbsp; It is considered with suspicion and always received with caution, not only because it is inherently weak and unreliable, but also because it is easily fabricated and concocted.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, without any evidence to show that private complainants were propelled by any ill motive to testify falsely against appellant, their testimonies deserve full faith and credit.&nbsp; After all, the doctrinal rule is that findings of fact made by the trial court, which had the opportunity to directly observe the witnesses and to determine the probative value of the other testimonies, are entitled to great weight and respect because the trial court is in a better position to assess the same, an opportunity not equally open to the appellate court.&nbsp; The absence of any showing that the trial court plainly overlooked certain facts of substance and value that, if considered, might affect the result of the case, or that its assessment was arbitrary, impels us to defer to the trial court’s determination according credibility to the prosecution evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; This is more true if the findings of the trial court were affirmed by the appellate court, since it is settled that when the trial court’s findings have been affirmed by the appellate court, said findings are generally binding upon this Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Given the foregoing, we uphold the conviction of appellant for illegal recruitment in a large scale, which constitutes economic sabotage.&nbsp; The penalty of life imprisonment and the fine of P500,000.00, imposed upon appellant for the said offense by the RTC, and affirmed by the Court of Appeals, is in accord with Section 7(b) of Republic Act No. 8042, which provides:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 7.&nbsp; <i>Penalties.</i> –<br><br>(a) Any person found guilty of illegal recruitment shall suffer the penalty of imprisonment of not less than six (6) years and one (1) day but not more than twelve (12) years and a fine of not less than Two hundred thousand&nbsp; pesos (P200,000.00) nor more than Five hundred thousand pesos (P500,000.00).<br><br><b>(b) The penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of not less than Five hundred thousand pesos (P500,000.00) nor more than One million pesos (P1,000,000.00) shall be imposed if illegal recruitment constitutes economic sabotage as defined herein</b>. (Emphasis ours.)</blockquote><br><b><i><u>Estafa</u></i></b><br><br>We likewise affirm the conviction of appellant for three counts of estafa committed against the private complainants in Criminal Case Nos.&nbsp; 03-0123, 03-0127, and 03-0130, based on the very same evidence that proved appellant’s criminal liability for illegal recruitment.<br><br>It is settled that a person may be charged and convicted separately of illegal recruitment under Republic Act No. 8042, in relation to the Labor Code, and estafa under Article 315, paragraph 2(a) of the Revised Penal Code.&nbsp; As we explained in <i>People v. Cortez and Yabut</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>:<br><br><blockquote>In this jurisdiction, it is settled that a person who commits illegal recruitment may be charged and convicted separately of illegal recruitment under the Labor Code and estafa under par. 2(a) of Art. 315 of the Revised Penal Code.&nbsp; The offense of illegal recruitment is <i>malum prohibitum</i> where the criminal intent of the accused is not necessary for conviction, while estafa is<i> malum</i> in se where the criminal intent of the accused is crucial for conviction.&nbsp; Conviction for offenses under the Labor Code does not bar conviction for offenses punishable by other laws.&nbsp; Conversely, conviction for estafa under par. 2(a) of Art. 315 of the Revised Penal Code does not bar a conviction for illegal recruitment under the Labor Code.&nbsp; It follows that one’s acquittal of the crime of estafa will not necessarily result in his acquittal of the crime of illegal recruitment in large scale, and <i>vice versa</i>. (Citations omitted.)</blockquote><br>Article 315, paragraph 2(a) of the Revised Penal Code defines estafa as:<br><br><blockquote>Art. 315.<i> Swindling (estafa)</i>. - Any person who shall defraud another by any of the means mentioned hereinbelow x x x:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>2. By means of any of the following false pretenses or fraudulent acts executed prior to or simultaneously with the commission of the fraud:<br><br>(a) By using a fictitious name, or falsely pretending to possess power, influence, qualifications, property, credit, agency, business or imaginary transactions; or by means of other similar deceits.</blockquote><br>The elements of estafa are: (a) that the accused defrauded another by abuse of confidence or by means of deceit, and (b) that damage or prejudice capable of pecuniary estimation is caused to the offended party or third person.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Appellant contends that he cannot be convicted of estafa because the element of deceit is lacking.&nbsp; He insists on the absence of proof that he made any false statement or fraudulent representation to private complainants.<br><br>We are not persuaded.&nbsp; As we had previously discussed herein, private complainants were able to establish, through their positive and credible testimonies, that appellant acted in conspiracy with his co-accused to mislead private complainants into believing that appellant and his co-accused, for a fee, can deploy private complainants abroad for employment.&nbsp; Decena testified that appellant gave her a copy of the purported job order for Korea, while Poserio avowed that appellant encouraged him to apply for work abroad.&nbsp; Daud, appellant’s fellow conspirator, accepted placement fees from private complainants, even issuing receipts for some; instructed private complainants to undergo medical examination; and took private complainants’ passports.&nbsp; The representations made by appellant and his co-accused to private complainants were actually false and fraudulent, not only because they were not duly authorized to undertake recruitment for overseas employment, but also because there were no actual jobs waiting for private complainants in Korea and private complainants never had a chance to leave for work abroad.<br><br>Appellant also argues that the second element of estafa, which is prejudice or pecuniary loss, was not established during trial as the prosecution was unable to present any receipt signed by appellant proving that he received money from private complainants.<br><br>We disagree once more with appellant.&nbsp; We reiterate that when conspiracy has been established, the act of one conspirator is the act of all.&nbsp; All three private complainants testified that they paid placement fees to Daud, who issued receipts for some amounts either in her name or in the name of one “Nimfa Min.”&nbsp; Moreover, the payment of placement fees to illegal recruiters is not evidenced by receipts alone; it can also be established by testimonies of witnesses.&nbsp; In <i>People v. Pabalan</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> we held:<br><br><blockquote>Although not all of the amounts testified to by complainants were covered by receipts, the fact that there were no receipts for some of the amounts delivered to him does not mean that appellant did not accept or receive such payments. This Court has ruled in several cases that the absence of receipts in a criminal case for illegal recruitment does not warrant the acquittal of the accused and is not fatal to the case of the prosecution. As long as the witnesses had positively shown through their respective testimonies that the accused is the one involved in the prohibited recruitment, he may be convicted of the offense despite the want of receipts.<br><br>The Statute of Frauds and the rules of evidence do not require the presentations of receipts in order to prove the existence of a recruitment agreement and the procurement of fees in illegal recruitment cases. The amounts may consequently be proved by the testimony of witnesses. (Citation omitted.)</blockquote><br>Again, there is no cogent reason for us to disturb the finding of the RTC, affirmed by the Court of Appeals, that both elements of estafa are present in Criminal Case Nos.&nbsp; 03-0123, 03-0127, and 03-0130.&nbsp; Thus, we sustain appellant’s conviction for estafa, punishable under Article 315, paragraph 2(a), of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>The penalty for estafa depends on the amount of defraudation.&nbsp; Per Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code:<br><br>Art. 315. <i> Swindling (estafa)</i>. – Any person who shall defraud another by any of the means mentioned herein below shall be punished by:<br><br><blockquote>1<sup>st</sup>.

but the total penalty which may be imposed shall not exceed twenty years.&nbsp; In such cases, and in connection with the accessory penalties which may be imposed and for the purpose of the other provisions of this Code, the penalty shall be termed <i>prision mayor</i> or <i>reclusion temporal,</i> as the case may be[.]</blockquote><br>The prescribed penalty for estafa under Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code, when the amount of the fraud is over P12,000.00 but not exceeding P22,000.00, is <i>prision correccional</i> maximum to <i>prision mayor</i> minimum (<i>i.e</i>., from 4 years, 2 months, and 1 day to 8 years).&nbsp; Under the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the minimum term shall be within the range of the penalty next lower to that prescribed by the Revised Penal Code, or anywhere within <i>prision correccional</i> minimum and medium (<i>i.e</i>., from 6 months and 1 day to 4 years and 2 months).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp;

To compute the minimum, medium, and maximum periods of the prescribed penalty for estafa when the amount of fraud exceeds P12,000.00, the time included in <i>prision correccional</i> maximum to <i>prision mayor</i> minimum shall be divided into three equal portions, with each portion forming a period.&nbsp; Following this computation, the minimum period for<i> prision correccional </i>maximum to <i>prision mayor </i>minimum is from 4 years, 2 months, and 1 day to 5 years, 5 months, and 10 days; the medium period is from 5 years, 5 months, and 11 days to 6 years, 8 months, and 20 days;
