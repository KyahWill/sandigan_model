The Decision dated 30 March 2009 of the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 45 is hereby <b>AFFIRMED with modification</b> in that the penalty imposed upon accused-appellants shall simply be <i>reclusion perpetua</i> with its accessory penalties and that the award of civil indemnity is increased to Seventy[-]Five Thousand Pesos (P75,000.00).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></blockquote><br>The Court of Appeals sustained the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the RTC considering that the RTC had observed and monitored at close range the conduct, behavior and deportment of the witnesses as they testified.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals corrected the penalty imposed, and explained that <i>reclusion perpetua</i> is an indivisible penalty which should be imposed without specifying the duration.<br><br>On June 29, 2011, the accused-appellants moved for reconsideration,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> which the Court of Appeals denied in its November 8, 2011 Resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>&nbsp; Unsatisfied, the accused-appellants appealed their case before this Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br><center><b>This Court’s Ruling</b></center><br>The accused-appellants pray for the reversal of the judgment of conviction in the criminal case on the following assignment of errors: the RTC and the Court of Appeals erred in (1) giving credence and weight to the prosecution evidence, (2) finding that there was conspiracy among the accused-appellants, and (3) finding the accused-appellants guilty beyond reasonable doubt based on the prosecution evidence.<br><br>In essence, the defense disagrees with the disposition of the Court of Appeals affirming their conviction for murder with direct assault on the ground that some of the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses constitute circumstantial evidence, and that the prosecution was not able to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>The appeal fails.<br><br>After a review of the record of the case, this Court sustains the conviction of the accused-appellants for murder with direct assault.<br><br>The age-old rule is that the task of assigning values to the testimonies of witnesses on the witness stand and weighing their credibility is best left to the trial court which forms its first-hand impressions as a witness testifies before it. It is, thus, no surprise that findings and conclusions of trial courts on the credibility of witnesses enjoy, as a rule, a badge of respect, for trial courts have the advantage of observing the demeanor of witnesses as they testify.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>This Court had nevertheless carefully scrutinized the records but found no indication that the trial and the appellate courts overlooked or failed to appreciate facts that, if considered, would change the outcome of this case.&nbsp; The trial court and the appellate court did not err in giving credence to the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, particularly of Antipolo who was an eyewitness to the crime.<br><br>Antipolo’s testimony did not suffer from any serious and material inconsistency that could possibly detract from his credibility.&nbsp; He identified the accused-appellant Nonoy and accused Negro as those who fired at Floro about seven times, while accused-appellants Edel and Nonong were on standby also holding their firearms.&nbsp; He also witnessed accused Gali shouting to the gunmen to stop and escape.&nbsp; He narrated that after all the accused left, Mayor Carlos, Sr., Rey and Materdam arrived aboard the mayor’s vehicle.&nbsp; He also heard Mayor Carlos said “leave it because it’s already dead.”&nbsp; From his direct and straightforward testimony, there is no doubt as to the identity of the culprits.<br><br>To successfully prosecute the crime of murder, the following elements must be established:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>&nbsp; (1) that a person was killed; (2) that the accused killed him or her; (3) that the killing was attended by any of the qualifying circumstances mentioned in Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code; and (4) that the killing is not parricide or infanticide.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>In this case, the prosecution was able to clearly establish that (1) Floro was killed; (2) Ex-Mayor Carlos, Sr., Rey, Edel, Nonong, and Calvin were five of the nine perpetrators who killed him; (3) the killing was attended by the qualifying circumstance of evident premeditation as testified to by prosecution eyewitnesses, Servando and Antipolo, as well as treachery as below discussed; and (4) the killing of Floro was neither parricide nor infanticide.<br><br>Of the four elements, the second and third elements are essentially contested by the defense.&nbsp; The Court finds that the prosecution unquestionably established these two elements.<br><br>For the second element, the prosecution presented pieces of evidence which when joined together point to the accused-appellants as the offenders. Foremost, there is motive to kill Floro.&nbsp; It was Floro’s support for Vicente Cotero, who was Rey’s opponent for the position of mayor in Placer, Masbate. Second, the prosecution was able to establish that the accused-appellants planned to kill Floro on two separate occasions.&nbsp; The prosecution witness, Servando, was present in Mayor Carlos, Sr.’s house when they were plotting to kill Floro.&nbsp; He also heard Mayor Carlos, Sr. say “<i>ipatumba si Floro Casas.”</i>&nbsp; Third, Antipolo was an eyewitness to the killing.&nbsp; His testimony was corroborated by another witness, Serapion, who testified having seen the accused-appellants leaving the school a few minutes after he heard the gunshots.&nbsp; Serapion also recounted having heard one of them said “mission accomplished sir,” after which, Mayor Carlos, Sr. ordered them to leave.<br><br>Essentially, the prosecution evidence consists of both direct evidence and circumstantial evidence.&nbsp; The testimony of the eyewitness Antipolo is direct evidence of the commission of the crime.<br><br>Circumstantial evidence is that evidence which proves a fact or series of facts from which the facts in issue may be established by inference.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>&nbsp; It consists of proof of collateral facts and circumstances from which the existence of the main fact may be inferred according to reason and common experience.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>&nbsp; Here, the circumstantial evidence consists of the testimonies of Servando and Serapion. Servando was present when Mayor Carlos, Sr. ordered his men to kill Floro.&nbsp; Whether this order was executed can be answered by relating it to Antipolo’s eyewitness account as well as Serapion’s testimony.<br><br>As for the third element of qualifying circumstance, the prosecution witness, Servando, testified that he was present on the two occasions when the accused-appellants were planning to kill Floro.&nbsp; His categorical and straightforward narration proves the existence of evident premeditation.<br><br>Treachery also attended the killing of Floro.&nbsp; For treachery to be present, two elements must concur:&nbsp; (1) at the time of the attack, the victim was not in a position to defend himself; and (2) the accused consciously and deliberately adopted the particular means, methods, or forms of attack employed by him.&nbsp; The essence of treachery is that the attack is deliberate and without warning, done in a swift and unexpected way, affording the hapless, unarmed and unsuspecting victim no chance to resist or escape.&nbsp; In this case, accused-appellant Nonoy and accused Negro successively fired at Floro about seven times – and the victim sustained 13 gunshot wounds all found to have been inflicted at close range giving the latter no chance at all to evade the attack and defend himself from the unexpected onslaught.&nbsp; Accused-appellants Edel and Nonong were on standby also holding their firearms to insure the success of their “mission” without risk to themselves; and three others served as lookouts.&nbsp; Hence, there is no denying that their collective acts point to a clear case of treachery.<br><br><i><u>Defense of denial and alibi</u></i><br><br>The twin defenses of denial and alibi raised by the accused-appellants must fail in light of the positive identification made by Antipolo and Serapion. Alibi and denial are inherently weak defenses and must be brushed aside when the prosecution has sufficiently and positively ascertained the identity of the accused as in this case.&nbsp; It is also axiomatic that positive testimony prevails over negative testimony.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>&nbsp; The accused-appellants’ alibis that they were at different places at the time of the shooting are negative and self-serving and cannot be given more evidentiary value vis-à-vis the affirmative testimony of credible witnesses.&nbsp; The accused-appellants, the victim, and the prosecution witnesses reside in the same municipality and are, therefore, familiar with one another.&nbsp; More so, that the two principal accused in this case are prominent political figures. Therefore, the prosecution witnesses could not have been mistaken on the accused-appellants’ identity including those who remained at large.<br><br>Further, it has been held that for the defense of alibi to prosper, the accused must prove the following:&nbsp; (i) that he was present at another place at the time of the perpetration of the crime; and (ii) that it was physically impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime during its commission.&nbsp; Physical impossibility involves the distance and the facility of access between the crime scene and the location of the accused when the crime was committed; the accused must demonstrate that he was so far away and could not have been physically present at the crime scene and its immediate vicinity when the crime was committed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup>&nbsp; Here, the accused-appellants utterly failed to satisfy the above-quoted requirements. In fact, Mayor Carlos, Sr. and his other co-accused, except for Nonong, admitted that they were near the school before the incident and at the school minutes after the killing took place.&nbsp; Certainly, the distance was not too far as to preclude the presence of accused-appellants at the school, and/or for them to slip away from where they were supposed to be, unnoticed.<br><br><i><u>Penalties</u></i><br><br>On the offense committed by accused-appellants, the RTC correctly concluded that they should be held accountable for the complex crime of direct assault with murder.&nbsp; There are two modes of committing <i>atentados contra la autoridad o sus agentes</i> under Article 148 of the Revised Penal Code.&nbsp; Accused-appellants committed the second form of assault, the elements of which are that there must be an attack, use of force, or serious intimidation or resistance upon a person in authority or his agent; the assault was made when the said person was performing his duties or on the occasion of such performance; and the accused knew that the victim is a person in authority or his agent, that is, that the accused must have the intention to offend, injure or assault the offended party as a person in authority or an agent of a person in authority.<br><br>In this case, Floro was the duly appointed District Supervisor of Public Schools, Placer, Masbate, thus, was a person in authority.&nbsp; But contrary to the statement of the RTC that there was direct assault just because Floro was a person in authority, this Court clarifies that the finding of direct assault is based on the fact that the attack or assault on Floro was, in reality, made by reason of the performance of his duty as the District Supervisor.<br><br>When the assault results in the killing of that agent or of a person in authority for that matter, there arises the complex crime of direct assault with murder or homicide.<br><br>The offense is a complex crime, the penalty for which is that for the graver offense, to be imposed in the maximum period. Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659, provides for the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death for the felony of murder; thus, the imposable penalty should have been death. Plus the fact that there exists an aggravating circumstance, pursuant to Article 63, paragraph 2 of the Revised Penal Code, the proper penalty is death. But the imposition of death penalty has been prohibited by Republic Act No. 9346, entitled “An Act Prohibiting the Imposition of Death Penalty in the Philippines”; thus, the RTC, as affirmed by the Court of Appeals, properly imposed upon accused-appellants the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua.</i><br><br><i><u>The Proper Indemnities</u></i><br><br>As to the proper monetary awards imposable for the crime charged, modifications must be made herein.&nbsp; The award of P100,000.00 each as civil indemnity and moral damages is proper to conform with current jurisprudence. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>Further, when a crime is committed with an aggravating circumstance either as qualifying or generic, an award of exemplary damages is justified under Article 2230<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> of the New Civil Code.&nbsp; Thus, conformably with the above, the legal heirs of the victim are also entitled to an award of exemplary damages<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> in the amount of P100,000.00.<br><br>Lastly, an interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum shall be imposed on all the damages awarded, to earn from the date of the finality of this judgment until fully paid, in line with prevailing jurisprudence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>At this point, notice must be made that on January 28, 2014, the Superintendent, New Bilibid Prison informed this Court of the death of accused-appellant Ex-Mayor Carlos, Sr. on January 9, 2013.&nbsp; In view thereof, the case against deceased Ex-Mayor Carlos, Sr. is hereby ordered dismissed.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the Court of Appeals Decision dated May 12, 2011 in CA-G.R.
