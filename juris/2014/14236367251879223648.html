We take note of the fact that petitioner acquired the Global City lots from the National Government.&nbsp; The transaction was not subject to any sales or business tax.&nbsp; Since the seller did not pass on any tax liability to petitioner, the latter may not claim tax credit.&nbsp; Clearly then, petitioner cannot simply demand that it is entitled to the transitional input tax credit.<br><br>x x x x<br><br><i>Another point</i>.&nbsp; Section 105 of the National Internal Revenue Code, as amended by EO No. 273, explicitly provides that the transitional input tax credit shall be based on “the beginning inventory of goods, materials and supplies <b><u>or</u></b> the actual value-added tax paid on such goods, materials and supplies, whichever is higher.” Note that the law did not simply say – the transitional input tax credit shall be 8% of the beginning inventory of goods, materials and supplies.<br><br>Instead, lawmakers went on to say that the creditable input tax shall be <i>whichever is higher</i> between the value of the inventory and the actual VAT paid.&nbsp; Necessarily then, a comparison of these two figures would have to be made.&nbsp; This strengthens Our view that previous payment of the VAT is indispensable to determine the actual value of the input tax creditable against the output tax.&nbsp; So too, this is in consonance with the present tax credit method adopted in this jurisdiction whereby an entity can credit against or subtract from the VAT charged on its sales or outputs the VAT paid on its purchases, inputs and imports.<br><br><i>We proceed to traverse another argument raised in this controversy.</i> Petitioner insists that the term “goods” which was one of the bases in computing the transitional input tax credit must be construed so as to include <b>real properties held primarily for sale to customers. </b> Petitioner posits that respondent Commissioner practically rewrote the law when it issued Revenue Regulations No. 7-95 which limited the basis of the 8% transitional input tax credit to the value of <i>improvements</i> alone.<br><br><i>Petitioner is clearly mistaken.</i><br><br>The term “goods” has been defined to mean any movable or tangible objects which are appreciable or tangible.&nbsp; More specifically, the word “goods” is always used to designate wares, commodities, and personal chattels; and does not include <i>chattels real.</i>&nbsp; “Real property” on the other hand, refers to land, and generally whatever is erected or growing upon or affixed to land.&nbsp; It is therefore quite absurd to equate “goods” as being synonymous to “properties”.&nbsp; The vast difference between the terms “goods” and “real properties” is so obvious that petitioner’s assertion must be struck down for being utterly baseless and specious.<br><br>Along this line, We uphold the validity of Revenue Regulations No. 7-95.&nbsp; The authority of the Secretary of Finance, in conjunction with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, to promulgate all needful rules and regulations for the effective enforcement of internal revenue laws cannot be controverted.&nbsp; Neither can it be disputed that such rules and regulations, as well as administrative opinions and rulings, ordinarily should deserve weight and respect by the courts.&nbsp; Much more fundamental than either of the above, however, is that all such issuances must not override, but must remain consistent and in harmony with, the law they seek to apply and implement.&nbsp; Administrative rules and regulations are intended to carry out, neither to supplant nor to modify, the law.&nbsp; Revenue Regulations No. 7-95 is clearly not inconsistent with the prevailing statute insofar as the provision on transitional input tax credit is concerned.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup><br><br></blockquote><b><ol start="4"><li>CA-G.R.

Petitioner’s contention that the 8% transitional input tax is statutorily presumed to the extent that its real properties which have not been subjected to VAT are entitled thereto, would directly contradict “input tax” as defined in Section 104 and would invariably cause disharmony.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup></blockquote><br>The CTA held that the 8% transitional input tax should not be viewed as an outright grant or presumption without need of prior taxes having been paid.&nbsp; Expounding on this, the CTA said:<br><br><blockquote>The simple instance in the aforesaid paragraphs of requiring the tax on the materials, supplies or goods comprising the inventory to be currently unutilized as deferred sales tax credit before the 8% presumptive input tax can be enjoyed readily leads to the inevitable conclusion that such 8% tax cannot be just granted to any VAT liable person if he has no priorly paid creditable sales taxes.&nbsp;

This is evident from the alternative modes of acquiring the proper amount of transitional input tax under Section 105, supra.&nbsp; One is by getting the equivalent amount of 8% tax based on the beginning inventory of goods, materials and supplies and the other is by the actual VAT paid on such goods, materials and supplies, whichever is higher.<br><br>As it is supposed to work, the transitional input tax should answer for the 10% output VAT liability that a VAT-registered person will incur once he starts business operations.&nbsp; While a VAT-registered person who is allowed a transitional input tax based on his actual payment of 10% VAT on his purchases can utilize the same to pay for his output VAT liability, a similar VAT-registered person like herein Petitioner, when allowed the alternative 8% transitional input tax, can offset his output VAT liability equally through such 8% tax even without having paid any previous tax.&nbsp;

Act No. 7716, real estate dealers at that time had no input taxes to speak of.&nbsp; With this in mind, the CIR correctly limited the application of the 8% transitional input tax to improvements on real estate dealers constructed on or after January 1, 1988 when the VAT was initially implemented.&nbsp; This is, as it should be, for to grant petitioner a refund or credit for input taxes it never paid would be tantamount to unjust enrichment.<br><br>As petitioner itself observes, the input tax credit provided for by Sec. 105 of the NIRC is a mechanism used to grant some relief from burdensome taxes.&nbsp; It follows, therefore, that not having been burdened by VAT or any other sales tax on its inventory of land prior to the effectivity of Rep.

At the same time, when transactions on real properties were finally made subject to VAT beginning with Rep. Act No. 7716, no corresponding amendment was adopted as regards Section 105 to provide for a differentiated treatment in the application of the transitional input tax credit with respect to real properties or real estate dealers.<br><br>It was Section 100 of the Old NIRC, as amended by Rep. Act No. 7716, which made real estate transactions subject to VAT for the first time. Prior to the amendment, Section 100 had imposed the VAT “on every sale, barter or exchange of goods”, without however specifying the kind of properties that fall within or under the generic class “goods” subject to the tax.<br><br><b>Rep. Act No. 7716, which significantly is also known as the Expanded Value-Added Tax (EVAT) law, expanded the coverage of the VAT by amending Section 100 of the Old NIRC in several respects, some of which we will enumerate. First, it made every sale, barter or exchange of “goods or properties” subject to VAT. Second, it generally defined “goods or properties” as “all tangible and intangible objects which are capable of pecuniary estimation.” Third, it included a non-exclusive enumeration of various objects that fall under the class “goods or properties” subject to VAT, including “[r]eal properties held primarily for sale to customers or held for lease in the ordinary course of trade or business.”<br><br>From these amendments to Section 100, is there any differentiated VAT treatment on real properties or real estate dealers that would justify the suggested limitations on the application of the transitional input tax on them? We see none.<br><br>Rep. Act No. 7716 clarifies that it is the real properties “held primarily for sale to customers or held for lease in the ordinary course of trade or business” that are subject to the VAT, and not when the real estate transactions are engaged in by persons who do not sell or lease properties in the ordinary course of trade or business. It is clear that those regularly engaged in the real estate business are accorded the same treatment as the merchants of other goods or properties available in the market. In the same way that a milliner considers hats as his goods and a rancher considers cattle as his goods, a real estate dealer holds real property, whether or not it contains improvements, as his goods.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup> (Citations omitted, emphasis added.)<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Under Section 105, the beginning inventory of “goods” forms part of the valuation of the transitional input tax credit. Goods, as commonly understood in the business sense, refers to the product which the VAT-registered person offers for sale to the public. With respect to real estate dealers, it is the real properties themselves which constitute their “goods”. Such real properties are the operating assets of the real estate dealer.<br><br>Section 4.100-1 of RR No. 7-95 itself includes in its enumeration of “goods or properties” such “real properties held primarily for sale to customers or held for lease in the ordinary course of trade or business.” Said definition was taken from the very statutory language of Section 100 of the Old NIRC. <b>By limiting the definition of goods to “improvements” in Section 4.105-1, the BIR not only contravened the definition of “goods” as provided in the Old NIRC, but also the definition which the same revenue regulation itself has provided.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> (Emphasis added.)<br></blockquote><br>The Court then emphasized in its Resolution in G.R. No. 158885 and G.R. No. 170680 that Section 105 of the old NIRC, on the transitional input tax credit, remained intact despite the enactment of Republic Act No. 7716. Section 105 was amended by Republic Act No. 8424, and the provisions on the transitional input tax credit are now embodied in Section 111(A) of the new NIRC, which reads: <br><br><blockquote>Section 111. <i>Transitional/Presumptive Input Tax Credits. </i>—<br><br>(A) <i>Transitional Input Tax Credits.</i> — A person who becomes liable to value-added tax or any person who elects to be a VAT-registered person shall, subject to the filing of an inventory <i>according to rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary of [F]inance, upon recommendation of the Commissioner,</i> be allowed input tax on his <u>beginning inventory</u> of goods, materials and supplies equivalent for 8% of the value of such inventory or the actual value-added tax paid on such goods, materials and supplies, whichever is higher, which shall be creditable against the output tax.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup><br></blockquote><br>In G.R. Nos. 158885 and 170680, the Court asked, “If the plain text of Republic Act No. 7716 fails to supply any apparent justification for limiting the beginning inventory of real estate dealers only to the improvements on their properties, how then were the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the courts <i>a quo</i> able to justify such a view?”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup>&nbsp; The Court then answered this question in this manner:<br><br><blockquote><center><i>IV.</i><br></center><br>The fact alone that the denial of FBDC's claims is in accord with Section 4.105-1 of RR 7-95 does not, of course, put this inquiry to rest.

Yet that inequity was precisely addressed by a transitory provision in E.O. No. 273 found in Section 25 thereof. <b>The provision authorized VAT-registered persons to invoke a “presumptive input tax equivalent to 8% of the value of the inventory as of December 31, 1987 of materials and supplies which are not for sale, the tax on which was not taken up or claimed as deferred sales tax credit,” and a similar presumptive input tax equivalent to 8% of the value of the inventory as of December 31, 1987 of goods for sale, the tax on which was not taken up or claimed as deferred sales tax credit.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis ours.)</blockquote><br><b>Whether there must have been previous<br>payment of sales tax or value-added tax<br>by petitioner on its land before petitioner <br>may claim the input tax credit granted by <br>Section 105 (now Section 111[A]) of the<br>NIRC.</b><br><br>The Court discussed this matter lengthily in its Decision in G.R. Nos. 158885 and 170680, and we quote:<br><br><blockquote>Section 25 of E.O. No. 273 perfectly remedies the problem assumed by the CTA as the basis for the introduction of transitional input tax credit in 1987. If the core purpose of the tax credit is only, as hinted by the CTA, to allow for some mode of accreditation of previously-paid sales taxes, then Section 25 alone would have sufficed. <b>Yet E.O. No. 273 amended the Old NIRC itself by providing for the transitional input tax credit under Section 105, thereby assuring that the tax credit would endure long after the last goods made subject to sales tax have been consumed.<br><br><u>If indeed the transitional input tax credit is integrally related to previously paid sales taxes, the purported causal link between those two would have been nonetheless extinguished long ago. Yet Congress has reenacted the transitional input tax credit several times; that fact simply belies the absence of any relationship between such tax credit and the long-abolished sales taxes. Obviously then, the purpose behind the transitional input tax credit is not confined to the transition from sales tax to VAT.</u></b><br><br>x x x <b>Section 105 states that the transitional input tax credits become available either to (1) a person who becomes liable to VAT; or (2) any person who elects to be VAT-registered. The clear language of the law entitles new trades or businesses to avail of the tax credit once they become VAT-registered. The transitional input tax credit, whether under the Old NIRC or the New NIRC, may be claimed by a newly-VAT registered person such as when a business as it commences operations.<br><br>x x x [I]t is not always true that the acquisition of such goods, materials and supplies entail the payment of taxes on the part of the new business. In fact, this could occur as a matter of course by virtue of the operation of various provisions of the NIRC, and not only on account of a specially legislated exemption.</b><br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>The interpretation proffered by the CTA would exclude goods and properties which are acquired through sale not in the ordinary course of trade or business, donation or through succession, from the beginning inventory on which the transitional input tax credit is based. This prospect all but highlights the ultimate absurdity of the respondents' position. Again, nothing in the Old NIRC (or even the New NIRC) speaks of such a possibility or qualifies the previous payment of VAT or any other taxes on the goods, materials and supplies as a pre-requisite for inclusion in the beginning inventory.<br><br><u>It is apparent that the transitional input tax credit operates to benefit newly VAT-registered persons, whether or not they previously paid taxes in the acquisition of their beginning inventory of goods, materials and supplies</u>.</b> During that period of transition from non-VAT to VAT status, the transitional input tax credit serves to alleviate the impact of the VAT on the taxpayer. At the very beginning, the VAT-registered taxpayer is obliged to remit a significant portion of the income it derived from its sales as output VAT. The transitional input tax credit mitigates this initial diminution of the taxpayer's income by affording the opportunity to offset the losses incurred through the remittance of the output VAT at a stage when the person is yet unable to credit input VAT payments.<br><br>There is another point that weighs against the CTA's interpretation. Under Section 105 of the Old NIRC, the rate of the transitional input tax credit is “8% of the value of such inventory or the actual value-added tax paid on such goods, materials and supplies, whichever is higher.” <b>If indeed the transitional input tax credit is premised on the previous payment of VAT, then it does not make sense to afford the taxpayer the benefit of such credit based on “8% of the value of such inventory” should the same prove higher than the actual VAT paid.</b> This intent that the CTA alluded to could have been implemented with ease had the legislature shared such intent by providing the actual VAT paid as the sole basis for the rate of the transitional input tax credit.<br><br>The CTA harped on the circumstance that FBDC was excused from paying any tax on the purchase of its properties from the national government, even claiming that to allow the transitional input tax credit is “tantamount to giving an undeserved bonus to real estate dealers similarly situated as [FBDC] which the Government cannot afford to provide.” <b>Yet the tax laws in question, and all tax laws in general, are designed to enforce uniform tax treatment to persons or classes of persons who share minimum legislated standards. The common standard for the application of the transitional input tax credit, as enacted by E.O. No. 273 and all subsequent tax laws which reinforced or reintegrated the tax credit, is simply that the taxpayer in question has become liable to VAT or has elected to be a VAT-registered person. E.O. No. 273 and the subsequent tax laws are all decidedly neutral and accommodating in ascertaining who should be entitled to the tax credit, and it behooves the CIR and the CTA to adopt a similarly judicious perspective</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> (Citations omitted, emphases ours.)</blockquote><br>The Court <i>En Banc</i> in its Resolution in <b>G.R. No. 173425</b> likewise discussed the question of prior payment of taxes as a prerequisite before a taxpayer could avail of the transitional input tax credit.&nbsp; The Court found that petitioner is entitled to the 8% transitional input tax credit, and clearly said that the fact that petitioner acquired the Global City property under a tax-free transaction makes no difference as prior payment of taxes is not a prerequisite.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup>&nbsp; We quote pertinent portions of the resolution below:<br><br><blockquote><b>This argument has long been settled. To reiterate, prior payment of taxes is not necessary before a taxpayer could avail of the 8% transitional input tax credit.</b> This position is solidly supported by law and jurisprudence, <i>viz</i>.:<br><br><i><b>First</b></i>. Section 105 of the old National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) clearly provides that for a taxpayer to avail of the 8% transitional input tax credit, all that is required from the taxpayer is to file a beginning inventory with the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). It was never mentioned in Section 105 that prior payment of taxes is a requirement. x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b><i>Second.</i></b> Since the law (Section 105 of the NIRC) does not provide for prior payment of taxes, to require it now would be tantamount to judicial legislation which, to state the obvious, is not allowed.<br><br><b><i>Third.</i></b> A transitional input tax credit is not a tax refund per se but a tax credit. Logically, prior payment of taxes is not required before a taxpayer could avail of transitional input tax credit. As we have declared in our September 4, 2012 Decision, “[t]ax credit is not synonymous to tax refund. Tax refund is defined as the money that a taxpayer overpaid and is thus returned by the taxing authority. Tax credit, on the other hand, is an amount subtracted directly from one's total tax liability. It is any amount given to a taxpayer as a subsidy, a refund, or an incentive to encourage investment.”<br><br><b><i>Fourth.</i></b> The issue of whether prior payment of taxes is necessary to avail of transitional input tax credit is no longer novel. It has long been settled by jurisprudence. x x x.<br><br><b><i>Fifth</i></b>. Moreover, in <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Central Luzon Drug Corp.</i>, this Court had already declared that prior payment of taxes is not required in order to avail of a tax credit. x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup> (Citations omitted, emphases ours.)</blockquote><br><b>The Court has thus categorically ruled that prior payment of taxes is not required for a taxpayer to avail of the 8% transitional input tax credit provided in Section 105 of the old NIRC and that petitioner is entitled to it, despite the fact that petitioner acquired the Global City property under a tax-free transaction</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup>&nbsp; The Court <i>En Banc</i> held:<br><br><blockquote>Contrary to the view of the CTA and the CA, there is nothing in the abovequoted provision to indicate that prior payment of taxes is necessary for the availment of the 8% transitional input tax credit. Obviously, all that is required is for the taxpayer to file a beginning inventory with the BIR.<br><br>To require prior payment of taxes x x x is not only tantamount to judicial legislation but would also render nugatory the provision in Section 105 of the old NIRC that the transitional input tax credit shall be “8% of the value of [the beginning] inventory or the actual [VAT] paid on such goods, materials and supplies, whichever is higher” because the actual VAT (now 12%) paid on the goods, materials, and supplies would always be higher than the 8% (now 2%) of the beginning inventory which, following the view of Justice Carpio, would have to exclude all goods, materials, and supplies where no taxes were paid. Clearly, limiting the value of the beginning inventory only to goods, materials, and supplies, where prior taxes were paid, was not the intention of the law. Otherwise, it would have specifically stated that the beginning inventory excludes goods, materials, and supplies where no taxes were paid.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup></blockquote><br><b>Whether Revenue Regulations No. 7-95 is<br>a valid implementation of Section 105 of <br>the NIRC.</b><br><br>In the April 2, 2009 Decision in G.R. Nos. 158885 and 170680, the <b>Court struck down Section 4.105-1 of Revenue Regulations No. 7-95 for being in conflict with the law</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup>&nbsp; The decision reads in part as follows:<br><br><blockquote>[There] is no logic that coheres with either E.O. No. 273 or Rep. Act No. 7716 which supports the restriction imposed on real estate brokers and their ability to claim the transitional input tax credit based on the value of their real properties. In addition, the very idea of excluding the real properties itself from the beginning inventory simply runs counter to what the transitional input tax credit seeks to accomplish for persons engaged in the sale of goods, whether or not such “goods” take the form of real properties or more mundane commodities.<br><br>Under Section 105, the beginning inventory of “goods” forms part of the valuation of the transitional input tax credit. Goods, as commonly understood in the business sense, refers to the product which the VAT-registered person offers for sale to the public. With respect to real estate dealers, it is the real properties themselves which constitute their “goods”. Such real properties are the operating assets of the real estate dealer.<br><br>Section 4.100-1 of RR No. 7-95 itself includes in its enumeration of “goods or properties” such “real properties held primarily for sale to customers or held for lease in the ordinary course of trade or business.” Said definition was taken from the very statutory language of Section 100 of the Old NIRC. By limiting the definition of goods to “improvements” in Section 4.105-1, the BIR not only contravened the definition of “goods” as provided in the Old NIRC, but also the definition which the same revenue regulation itself has provided.<br><br>The Court of Tax Appeals claimed that under Section 105 of the Old NIRC the basis for the inventory of goods, materials and supplies upon which the transitional input VAT would be based “shall be left to regulation by the appropriate administrative authority”. This is based on the phrase “filing of an inventory as prescribed by regulations” found in Section 105. Nonetheless, Section 105 does include the particular properties to be included in the inventory, namely goods, materials and supplies. It is questionable whether the CIR has the power to actually redefine the concept of “goods”, as she did when she excluded real properties from the class of goods which real estate companies in the business of selling real properties may include in their inventory. The authority to prescribe regulations can pertain to more technical matters, such as how to appraise the value of the inventory or what papers need to be filed to properly itemize the contents of such inventory. But such authority cannot go as far as to amend Section 105 itself, which the Commissioner had unfortunately accomplished in this case.<br><br>It is of course axiomatic that a rule or regulation must bear upon, and be consistent with, the provisions of the enabling statute if such rule or regulation is to be valid. In case of conflict between a statute and an administrative order, the former must prevail. Indeed, <b>the CIR has no power to limit the meaning and coverage of the term “goods” in Section 105 of the Old NIRC absent statutory authority or basis to make and justify such limitation. A contrary conclusion would mean the CIR could very well moot the law or arrogate legislative authority unto himself by retaining sole discretion to provide the definition and scope of the term “goods.”</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis added.)</blockquote><br>Furthermore, in G.R.

This has been explained in the Decision dated April 2, 2009, thus:<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>Section 4.105-1 of RR 7-95 restricted the definition of <i>“goods,”</i> <i>viz</i>.: </b><br><blockquote>“However, <u>in the case of real estate dealers, t<i>he basis of the presumptive input tax shall be the improvements</i></u>, such as buildings, roads, drainage systems, and other similar structures, constructed on or after the effectivity of EO 273 (January 1, 1988).”<br></blockquote><b>As mandated by Article 7 of the Civil Code, an administrative rule or regulation cannot contravene the law on which it is based.

RR 6-97 was basically a reiteration of the same Section 4.105-1 of RR 7-95, except that the RR 6-97 <b>deleted </b>the following paragraph:<br><blockquote><i>“However, in the case of real estate dealers, the basis of the presumptive input tax shall be the improvements, such as buildings, roads, drainage systems, and other similar structures, constructed on or after the effectivity of E.O. 273 (January 1, 1988).”</i><br></blockquote>It is clear, therefore, that under RR 6-97, the allowable transitional input tax credit is not limited to improvements on real properties. The particular provision of RR 7-95 has effectively been repealed by RR 6-97 which is now in consonance with Section 100 of the NIRC, insofar as the definition of real properties as goods is concerned. The failure to add a specific repealing clause would not necessarily indicate that there was no intent to repeal RR 7-95. The fact that the aforequoted paragraph was deleted created an irreconcilable inconsistency and repugnancy between the provisions of RR 6-97 and RR 7-95.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>As pointed out in Our Decision of April 2, 2009, to give Section 105 a restrictive construction that transitional input tax credit applies only when taxes were previously paid on the properties in the beginning inventory and there is a law imposing the tax which is presumed to have been paid, is to impose conditions or requisites to the application of the transitional tax input credit which are not found in the law.
