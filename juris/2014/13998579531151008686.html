In the case of miscellaneous expenses incurred for an office specified in the law, such certification shall be executed solely by the head of the office. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Further, petitioners alleged that CoA Circular No. 2006-01 is violative of the equal protection clause since officials of GOCCs, such as the LWUA officials, are, among others, prohibited by virtue of the same issuance from supporting their reimbursement claims with “certifications,” unlike officials of the national government agencies (NGAs) who have been so permitted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> To this end, petitioners argued that the employees of NGAs and GOCCs are similarly situated and that there exists no substantial distinction between them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Finally, petitioners submitted that CoA Circular No. 2006-01 was not duly published in the Official Gazette, or in a newspaper of general circulation and thus, unenforceable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br><center><b>The CoA Cluster Director’s Ruling</b></center><br>Petitioners’ appeal was denied by CoA Cluster Director IV Divinia M.

However, it held that the principle’s non-applicability does not necessarily buttress petitioners’ main argument that the phrase “and/or other documents evidencing disbursements” includes the “certifications” issued to support the claim for EME reimbursement. This is because the “other documents evidencing disbursements” must refer to documents that evidence disbursement, of which the certifications – being mere general statements that the certified amount was used as EME, and is within the prescribed ceiling therefor – are not.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>It further debunked petitioners’ reliance on the provisions of Section 397 of GAAM - Vol. I and Item III(4) of CoA Circular No. 89-300 as these issuances actually show the contrary intention to include “certifications” in the phrase “other documents evidencing disbursements” as among the documents sufficient to support the claim for EME reimbursement under Item III(3) of CoA Circular No. 2006-01. The “certification” is separate and distinct from the term “other documents evidencing disbursements” whether under Section 397 of GAAM - Vol. I or Item III(4) of CoA Circular No. 89-300. The certification under these issuances is “in lieu of” the receipts and/or other documents evidencing disbursement. Moreover, the CoA observed that if the term “certification” is intended to be included in the term or among the “other documents evidencing disbursements” that will support a claim for EME reimbursement, then Section 397 of GAAM - Vol. I and Item III(4) of CoA Circular No. 89-300 would have stated so; however, the latter provisions did not. Besides, the CoA pointed out that CoA Circular No. 2006-01 specifically applies to GOCCs, GFIs and their subsidiaries, while CoA Circular No. 89-300, from which Section 397 of GAAM - Vol. I was lifted, exclusively applies to NGAs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Finally, the CoA maintained that there is a substantial distinction between the officials of NGAs and the officials of the GOCCs, GFIs and their subsidiaries insofar as their entitlement to EME is concerned. The former’s EME is sourced from the annual GAA, while the latter’s EME is provided by their corporate operating budget approved by their respective governing boards. In connection therewith, the CoA emphasized that the issuance of CoA Circular No. 2006-01 is pursuant to its exclusive constitutional authority to promulgate accounting and auditing rules and regulations, including those for the prevention and disallowance of irregular, unnecessary, excessive, extravagant, or unconscionable expenditures or uses of government funds. It is therefore within the purview of its mandate and the above-stated distinctions that CoA Circular No. 2006-01 must be interpreted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Dissatisfied, petitioners filed the present<i> certiorari </i>petition, imputing grave abuse of discretion on the part of the CoA.<br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b></center><br>The primordial issue for the Court’s resolution is whether or not grave abuse of discretion attended the CoA’s ruling in this case.<br><br><b><center>The Court’s Ruling</center></b><br>The petition lacks merit.<br><br>The CoA’s audit power is among the constitutional mechanisms that gives life to the check-and-balance system inherent in our system of government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> As an essential complement, the CoA has been vested with the exclusive authority to promulgate accounting and auditing rules and regulations, including those for the prevention and disallowance of irregular, unnecessary, excessive, extravagant, or unconscionable expenditures or uses of government funds and properties. This is found in Section 2, Article IX-D of the 1987 Philippine Constitution which provides that:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 2. x x x.<br><br>(2) The Commission shall have <b>exclusive authority</b>, subject to the limitations in this Article, to define the scope of its audit and examination, establish the techniques and methods required therefor, and<b> promulgate accounting and auditing rules and regulations</b>, including those for the prevention and disallowance of irregular, unnecessary, excessive, extravagant, or unconscionable expenditures or uses of government funds and properties. (Emphases supplied)</blockquote><br>As an independent constitutional body conferred with such power, it reasonably follows that the CoA’s interpretation of its own auditing rules and regulations, as enunciated in its decisions, should be accorded great weight and respect. In the recent case of <i>Delos Santos v. CoA</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> the Court explained the general policy of the Court towards CoA decisions reviewed under <i>certiorari</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> parameters:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br><blockquote>[T]he CoA is endowed with enough latitude to determine, prevent, and disallow irregular, unnecessary, excessive, extravagant or unconscionable expenditures of government funds. It is tasked to be vigilant and conscientious in safeguarding the proper use of the government's, and ultimately, the people's property.&nbsp; The exercise of its general audit power is among the constitutional mechanisms that gives life to the check and balance system inherent in our form of government.<br><br>x x x <b>[I]t is the general policy of the Court to sustain the decisions of administrative authorities, <u>especially one which is constitutionally-created, such as the CoA</u>, <u>not only on the basis of the doctrine of separation of powers but also for their presumed expertise in the laws they are entrusted to enforce</u></b>. Findings of administrative agencies are accorded not only respect but also finality when the decision and order are not tainted with unfairness or arbitrariness that would amount to grave abuse of discretion. <b>It is only when the CoA has acted without or in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, that this Court entertains a petition questioning its rulings</b>. x x x. (Emphases and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>The concept is well-entrenched:&nbsp; grave abuse of discretion exists when there is an evasion of a positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law or to act in contemplation of law as when the judgment rendered is not based on law and evidence but on caprice, whim, and despotism.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Not every error in the proceedings, or every erroneous conclusion of law or fact, constitutes grave abuse of discretion. The abuse of discretion to be qualified as “grave” must be so patent or gross as to constitute an evasion of a positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform the duty or to act at all in contemplation of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Viewed in the foregoing light, the Court finds that the CoA did not commit any grave abuse of discretion as its affirmance of Notice of Disallowance No. 09-001-GF(06) is based on cogent legal grounds.<br><br>First off, the Court concurs with the CoA’s conclusion that the “certification” submitted by petitioners cannot be properly considered as a supporting document within the purview of Item III(3) of CoA Circular No. 2006-01 which pertinently states that a “<b>claim for reimbursement of [EME] expenses shall be supported by receipts and/or <u>other documents evidencing disbursements</u></b>.” Similar to the word “receipts,” the “other documents” pertained to under the above-stated provision is qualified by the phrase “evidencing disbursements.” Citing its lexicographic definition, the CoA stated that the term “disbursement” means “to pay out commonly from a fund” or “to make payment in settlement of debt or account payable.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> That said, it then logically follows that petitioners’ “certification,” so as to fall under the phrase “other documents” under Item III(3) of CoA Circular No. 2006-01, must substantiate the “paying out of an account payable,” or, in simple term, a disbursement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> However, an examination of the sample “certification”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> attached to the petition does not, by any means, fit this description. The signatory therein merely certifies that he/she has spent, within a particular month, a certain amount for meetings, seminars, conferences, official entertainment, public relations, and the like, and that the certified amount is within the ceiling authorized under the LWUA corporate budget. Accordingly, since petitioners’ reimbursement claims were solely supported by this “certification,” the CoA properly disallowed said claims for failure to comply with CoA Circular No. 2006-01.<br><br>The CoA also correctly rejected petitioners’ invocation of the provisions of Section 397 of GAAM - Vol. I and CoA Circular No. 89-300 since, at the outset, such rules are applicable only to NGAs, and not to GOCCs, GFIs and their subsidiaries which are specifically governed by CoA Circular No. 2006-01.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> A perusal of CoA Circular No. 89-300, from which Section 397 of GAAM - Vol. I was merely reproduced, clearly indicates in Item II thereof, captioned “Scope and Coverage,” that the rules thereunder applies to “appropriations authorized under [the GAA of 1989] for <b>National Government agencies</b> [that] may be used for incurrence of extraordinary and miscellaneous expenses at the rates and by the offices and officials specified therein for, among others x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> A similar inference may be reached from a reading of Item I of CoA Circular No. 89-300, captioned as “Rationale,” which states that the circular was made in response to the “increasing number of queries and requests for clarification as to the real import and true intent of [the provisions of the GAA of 1989] authorizing the use by certain national government officials of appropriations authorized for their agencies for extraordinary and miscellaneous expenses.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> On the other hand, Item II of CoA Circular No. 2006-01, captioned as “Scope and Coverage,” explicitly states that “[t]his circular shall be applicable to all <b>GOCCs, GFIs and their subsidiaries</b>” and shall cover their “extraordinary and miscellaneous expenses and other similar expenses.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Item I of CoA Circular No. 2006-01, captioned as “Rationale,” also mentions the CoA’s declared policy to “prescribe rules and regulations specifically for <b>government corporations</b> to regulate the incurrence of these expenditures and ensure the prevention and disallowance of irregular, unnecessary, excessive, extravagant, or unconscionable expenditures or uses of government funds” considering that “<b>[g]overning boards of [GOCCs/GFIs]</b> are invariably empowered to appropriate through resolutions such amounts as they deem appropriate for extraordinary and miscellaneous expenses.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Based on the foregoing, it is readily apparent that petitioners’ reliance on Section 397 of GAAM - Vol. I and Item III(4) of CoA Circular No. 89-300 was improper, hence, the CoA’s apt dismissal of the same.<br><br>Lastly, the Court upholds the CoA’s finding that there exists a substantial distinction<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> between officials of NGAs and the officials of GOCCs, GFIs and their subsidiaries which justify the peculiarity in regulation. Since the EME of GOCCs, GFIs and their subsidiaries, are, pursuant to law, allocated by their own internal governing boards, as opposed to the EME of NGAs which are appropriated in the annual GAA duly enacted by Congress, there is a perceivable rational impetus for the CoA to impose nuanced control measures to check if the EME disbursements of GOCCs, GFIs and their subsidiaries constitute irregular, unnecessary, excessive, extravagant, or unconscionable government expenditures. Case in point is the LWUA Board of Trustees which, pursuant to Section 69 of PD 198, as amended, is “authorized to appropriate out of any funds of the Administration, such amounts as it may deem necessary for the operational and other expenses of the Administration including the purchase of necessary equipment.” Indeed, the Court recognizes that denying GOCCs, GFIs and their subsidiaries the benefit of submitting a secondary-alternate document in support of an EME reimbursement, such as the “certification” discussed herein, is a CoA policy intended to address the disparity in EME disbursement autonomy. As pertinently stated in CoA Circular No. 2006-01, the consideration underlying the rules and regulations contained therein is the fact that “[g]overning boards of [GOCCs/GFIs] are invariably empowered to appropriate through resolutions such amounts as they deem appropriate for extraordinary and miscellaneous expenses.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Hence, in due deference to the CoA’s constitutional prerogatives, the Court, absent any semblance of grave abuse of discretion in this case, respects the regulation, and consequently dismisses the petition. With these pronouncements, the Court finds it unnecessary to delve on the other ancillary issues raised by the parties in their pleadings. Notice of Disallowance No. 09-001-GF(06) dated July 21, 2009 is therefore upheld and the persons therein held liable are ordered to duly return the disallowed amount of P13,110,998.26.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DISMISSED</b>.
