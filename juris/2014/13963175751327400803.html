Trial on the merits ensued.<br><br><i><b>Factual Antecedents</b></i><br><br>The facts as summarized by the RTC, are as follows:<br><br><blockquote>The victim in these cases[,] “AAA[,]” testified that at noon time of April 8, 1999, she was x x x playing x x x with her playmates whereupon she wandered by the house of accused which x x x was just below their house.&nbsp; “AAA” clarified during her cross-examination that there was a vulcanizing shop owned by her father located in their house x x x and where accused was employed.&nbsp; While “AAA” was at the house of accused, she claimed that her genitals and buttocks were burned with a lighted cigarette by the said accused.&nbsp; “AAA” testified further that her clothes were taken off by the same accused who also took his clothes off after which he allegedly placed himself on top of her, inserted his penis and proceeded to have illicit carnal knowledge [of] the then six (6) year old girl. (TSN May 29, 2001, pp. 5-9; TSN Aug. 7, 2001, pp. 10-12.)<br><br>“BBB,” father of “AAA,” presented in court his daughter’s birth certificate (Exhibit “B”) which stated that she was born on April 4, 1993 (TSN Sept. 25, 2001, p. 4).&nbsp; On the other hand, Dr. Emmanuel Reyes the Medico-Legal Officer who examined “AAA” identified his Medico-Legal Report (Exhibit “M”) and testified that the victim indeed had two (2) third degree burns in the perianal region.&nbsp; Dr. Reyes testified that it was possible that the said burns were caused by a lighted cigarette stick being forced on the victim’s skin.&nbsp; Moreover, Dr. Reyes confirmed that there was a loss of virginity on the part of the victim and that the same could have been done 24 hours from the time of his examination which was also on April 8, 1999. (TSN Nov. 7, 2001 pp. 11-17)<br><br>“CCC” [aunt of “AAA”] testified that x x x she x x x assisted the mother of “AAA” in bringing the victim to the Pasig General Hospital and thereafter to Camp Crame where a doctor also examined “AAA” and confirmed that the latter was indeed a victim of rape.&nbsp; “CCC” testified that they then proceeded to the Women’s [D]esk to file the instant complaint against the accused. (TSN August 5, 2003 pp. 4-8)<br><br>On the other hand, [a]ccused denied the allegation of rape against him.&nbsp; Accused presented his brother-in-law Rogelio Oletin who testified that he was tending the store located at the house of accused when the latter supposedly arrived from work at 10:00 [a.m.] of April 8, 1999 and slept until 5:00 [p.m.] of the same day.&nbsp; According to Rogelio that is the usual routine of accused as the latter worked in the night shift schedule as vulcanizer in the vulcanizing shop owned by the victim’s father. (TSN February 3, 2006 pp. 6-8)<br><br>When accused testified on November 17, 2006, he essentially confirmed the testimony of his brother-in-law that it was impossible for him to have raped “AAA” on the date and time stated in the information as his night shift work schedule just would not permit such an incident to occur.&nbsp; Accused added that he knew of no reason why the family of the private complainant would pin the crime against him. (TSN Nov. 17, 2006 pp. 9-11 &amp; 14)<br><br>In an effort to explain the burn marks on the delicate parts of “AAA’s” body, the defense presented a supposed playmate of “AAA” in the person of Mary Pabuayan.&nbsp; According to Mary, she was then 7 years old when she and two other playmates together with “AAA” and Joel [“]Liit[”] the son of accused were burning worms near a santol tree in their neighborhood on a Good Friday in the year 1999.&nbsp; This Joel [“]Liit[”] supposedly lighted a straw which inadvertently burned the anal portion of “AAA’s” body.&nbsp; Mary’s exact words were to the effect that “napatakan ang puwit ni “AAA”.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br></blockquote><br><i><b>Ruling of the Regional Trial Court</b></i><br><br>On July 3, 2008, the RTC rendered its Decision finding appellant guilty of three counts of rape, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, accused Joel Crisostomo y Malliar is found GUILTY of all offenses stated in the three (3) Criminal Informations and is hereby sentenced to the following:<br><br>a)&nbsp; In Criminal Information # 99-16235 and Criminal Information # 99-16236, accused is to suffer the Indeterminate Penalty of imprisonment of ten (10) years and one (1) day of Prision Mayor as minimum to seventeen (17) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of Reclusion Temporal as maximum and is ordered to pay the victim “AAA” civil indemnity of P30,000.00, moral damages of P30,000.00 and exemplary damages of P15,000.00 for each of the two Criminal Informations.<br><br>b)&nbsp; In Criminal Information # 99-16237, accused is to suffer the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua and is ordered to pay the victim civil indemnity of P75,000.00, moral damages of P50,000.00 and exemplary damages of P30,000.00 with cost [of] suit for all Criminal Informations.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote><br>Aggrieved, appellant filed a Notice of Appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> which was given due course by the trial court in its Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> dated February 2, 2009.<br><br><i><b>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</b></i><br><br>In his Brief filed before the CA, appellant raised the following assignment of error:<br><br><blockquote>THE COURT <i>A QUO</i> GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY FOR THE CRIME OF RAPE (ARTICLE 266-A PAR. 1 AND ART. 267-B, PAR. 7 IN RELATION TO R.A.

In its Manifestation and Motion,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) informed this Court that it will no longer file a Supplemental Brief because it had already exhaustively discussed and refuted all the arguments of the appellant in its brief filed before the CA.&nbsp; Appellant likewise filed a Manifestation In Lieu of Supplemental Brief<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> praying that the case be deemed submitted for decision based on the pleadings submitted.<br><br><div align="center"><b>Our Ruling</b><br></div><br>The appeal lacks merit.<br><br>The RTC, as affirmed by the CA, correctly found appellant guilty of two counts of rape by sexual assault and one count of rape by sexual intercourse.&nbsp; Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) provides:<br><br><blockquote>ART. 266-A. <i> Rape, When and How Committed. - Rape is committed</i> –<br><br>1. By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:<br><ol type="a"><li>Through force, threat or intimidation;</li><li>When the offended party is deprived of reason or is otherwise unconscious;</li><li>By means of fraudulent machinations or grave abuse of authority;</li><li><b>&nbsp;When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above should be present;</b><br></li></ol>2.<b> By any person who, under any of the circumstances mentioned in paragraph 1 hereof, shall commit an act of sexual assault by inserting his penis into another person’s mouth or anal orifice, or any instrument or object, into the genital or anal orifice of another person</b>.&nbsp; (Emphases supplied)</blockquote><br>When the offended party is under 12 years of age, the crime committed is “termed statutory rape as it departs from the usual modes of committing rape.&nbsp; What the law punishes is carnal knowledge of a woman below 12 years of age.&nbsp; Thus, the only subject of inquiry is the age of the woman and whether carnal knowledge took place.&nbsp; The law presumes that the victim does not and cannot have a will of her own on account of her tender years.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> In this case, the prosecution satisfactorily established all the elements of statutory rape.&nbsp; “AAA” testified that on April 8, 1999, appellant took off her clothes and made her lie down.&nbsp; Appellant also removed his clothes, placed himself on top of “AAA,” inserted his penis into her vagina, and proceeded to have carnal knowledge of her.&nbsp; At the time of the rape, “AAA” was only six years of age.&nbsp; Her birth certificate showed that she was born on April 4, 1993.&nbsp; “AAA’s” testimony was corroborated by Dr. Emmanuel Reyes who found “AAA” to have fresh and bleeding hymenal lacerations.<br><br>Likewise, the prosecution proved beyond reasonable doubt appellant’s guilt for two counts of rape by sexual assault.&nbsp; Records show that appellant inserted a lit cigarette stick into “AAA’s” genital orifice causing her labia majora to suffer a 3rd degree burn.&nbsp; Appellant likewise inserted a lit cigarette stick into “AAA’s” anal orifice causing 3rd degree burns in her perianal region.<br><br>We agree with the CA that “AAA’s” “uncertainty” on whether it was a match, rod or a cigarette stick that was inserted into her private parts, did not lessen her credibility.&nbsp; Such “uncertainty” is so inconsequential and does not diminish the fact that an instrument or object was inserted into her private parts.&nbsp; This is the essence of rape by sexual assault.&nbsp;&nbsp; “[T]he gravamen of the crime of rape by sexual assault x x x is the insertion of the penis into another person’s mouth or anal orifice, or any instrument or object, into another person’s genital or anal orifice.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; In any event, “inconsistencies in a rape victim’s testimony do not impair her credibility, especially if the inconsistencies refer to trivial matters that do not alter the essential fact of the commission of rape.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; We also held in <i>People v. Piosang</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> that –<br><br><blockquote>“[t]estimonies of child-victims are normally given full weight and credit, since when a girl, particularly if she is a minor, says that she has been raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape has in fact been committed.&nbsp; When the offended party is of tender age and immature, courts are inclined to give credit to her account of what transpired, considering not only her relative vulnerability but also the shame to which she would be exposed if the matter to which she testified is not true.&nbsp; Youth and immaturity are generally badges of truth and sincerity.&nbsp; Considering her tender age, AAA could not have invented a horrible story. x x x ”</blockquote><br>Moreover, appellant’s argument that “AAA” did not manifest any stress or anxiety considering her traumatic experience is purely speculative and bereft of any legal basis.&nbsp; Besides, it is settled that people react differently when confronted with a startling experience.&nbsp; There is no standard behavioral response when one is confronted with a traumatic experience.&nbsp; Some may show signs of stress; but others may act nonchalantly.&nbsp; Nevertheless, “AAA’s” reaction does not in any way prove the innocence of appellant. As correctly pointed out by the OSG, regardless of “AAA’s” reactions, it did not diminish the fact that she was raped by appellant or that a crime was committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>We also agree with the CA that “CCC’s” efforts to hale appellant to the court should not be equated with ill-motive on her part.&nbsp; On the contrary, we find “CCC’s” efforts to seek justice for her niece who was raped more in accord with the norms of society.&nbsp; At any rate, even if we disregard “CCC’s” testimony, appellant’s conviction would still stand.&nbsp; We agree with the observation of the OSG that “CCC’s” “testimony actually had no great impact on the case.&nbsp; In truth, her testimony [was] composed mainly of the fact that she was the one who accompanied the mother of “AAA” in bringing “AAA” to the Pasig General Hospital and thereafter to Camp Crame and later on to the Women’s desk.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, appellant’s alibi and denial are weak defenses especially when weighed against “AAA’s” positive identification of him as the malefactor.&nbsp; Appellant did not even attempt to show that it was physically impossible for him to be at the crime scene at the time of its commission.&nbsp; In fact, he admitted that he lived just four houses away from the house of “AAA”.&nbsp; His denial is also unsubstantiated hence the same is self-serving and deserves no consideration or weight.&nbsp; The RTC properly disregarded the testimony of Rogelio Oletin (Oletin), appellant’s brother-in-law, who claimed that appellant was at his house at the time of the incident.&nbsp; As appellant already admitted, his house is near the house of “AAA” hence there was no physical impossibility for him to be present at the crime scene.&nbsp; Also, the RTC observed that Oletin’s testimony did not “prove beneficial to the defense.&nbsp; Suffice it to state that the private prosecutor correctly noted that the said witness was always smiling and laughing when answering questions propounded to him as if making a mockery of the proceedings which his own brother-in-law was facing.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Pursuant to Article 266-B of the RPC, the penalty for statutory rape (Criminal Case No. 99-16237) is death when the victim is a child below seven years old.&nbsp; There is no dispute that at the time the rape was committed on April 8, 1999, “AAA” was only six years old, having been born on April 4, 1993.&nbsp; However, pursuant to Republic Act No. 9346,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> shall be imposed on the appellant but without eligibility for parole.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; The CA thus correctly imposed the said penalty on appellant.<br><br>On the other hand, rape by sexual assault committed against a child below seven years old is punishable by <i>reclusion temporal</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, and there being no other aggravating or mitigating circumstance, the proper imposable penalty shall be <i>prision mayor</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> as minimum, to <i>reclusion temporal</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> as maximum.&nbsp; The CA thus correctly imposed the penalty of eight (8) years and one (1) day of <i>prision mayor</i>, as minimum, to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months of <i>reclusion temporal</i>, as maximum, for each count of sexual assault.<br><br>As regards damages, the CA correctly awarded the amounts of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity and P30,000.00 as exemplary damages in&nbsp; Criminal Case No. 99-16237 (statutory rape).&nbsp; However, the award of moral damages must be increased to P75,000.00 in line with prevailing jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> As regards Criminal Case No. 99-16235 and Criminal Case No. 99-16236 (rape by sexual assault), the CA likewise properly awarded the amounts of P30,000.00 as civil indemnity and&nbsp; P30,000.00 as moral damages, for each count.&nbsp; However, the award of exemplary damages for each count of rape by sexual assault must be increased to P30,000.00 in line with prevailing jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> In addition, all damages awarded shall earn interest at the rate of 6% <i>per annum</i> from date of finality of judgment until fully paid.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is <b>DISMISSED</b>.
