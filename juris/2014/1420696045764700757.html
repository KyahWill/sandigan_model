(Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Petitioner submits that from the foregoing provision, the surcharge should only be P2,571,617.14, computed by applying the 25% surcharge against the total amount of taxes not paid on time, which is the total amount of tax due from 1992 to 2002, or P10,286,468.57. In imposing a surcharge of P13,744,096.69 instead of P2,571,617.14, the trial court allegedly "varied and/or exceeded the terms of the judgment sought to be executed."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br><i><center>Issue<br></center></i><br>The sole issue before the court is the proper interpretation for purposes of execution of the dispositive portion of the Court of Appeals' decision in CA-G.R. CV No. 53297, promulgated on March 12, 2001 (which was affirmed by this court's April 9, 2003 decision in G.R. No. 149110). The dispositive portion reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING</b>, the decision appealed from is <b>SET ASIDE</b> and <b>REVERSED</b>.

The sum of P10,000.00 as litigation expenses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote></blockquote><br>In other words, the crucial point to be resolved is what the Court of Appeals meant by "[i]n all cases, to pay a surcharge of 25% of the tax due and unpaid" in the dispositive portion.<br><br>The trial court resolved the question, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>[Petitioner] obtained the amount of P2,571,617.14 by getting the 25% of PI0,256,468.57, the total unpaid tax due. Whereas, the [respondent], by further studying the data on record, obtained the 25% of the tax due yearly. The total unpaid tax due for example in year 1992 (P808,606.41) would be added the tax due for 1993 (P821.401.17), obtaining the sum of P1,630,007.58 as unpaid tax due. From this amount of P1,630,007.58 is to be taken the 25% surcharge, giving the amount of P407,501.89 to be added to the amount of P202.151.60, the 25% of the unpaid amount of P80.8,606.41. The same computation was made on the succeeding years up to the year 2002 giving the total amount of the surcharge/penalty of P13,744,096.69.<br><br>This Court finds the computation of the [respondent] more in accord with the decision in this case. The [petitioner] was imposed taxes based on the gross receipts yearly. <i>The tax due was computed yearly and therefore, it can be interpreted to mean that the 25% surcharge should also be computed yearly based on the unpaid tax due for each particular year.</i><br><br>Based on these computations, by adding the total tax due for the year 1992 to 2002 (P10,286,468.57), the total surcharge/penalty (P13,744,096.69) and the litigation expenses (P10,000.00) as contained in the dispositive portion, the [petitioner] has a total liability of P24,040,565.26. Since the [petitioner] has already paid the sum of P12,868,085.71; its total liability therefore is P11,172,479.55.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[33]</sup></font> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The trial court sustained respondent's computation of the surcharge based on the total unpaid tax for each year [proper tax for the year + unpaid tax of the previous year/s], which, in effect, resulted in the imposition of the 25% surcharge for every year of default in the payment of a franchise tax, thereby arriving at the total amount of P13,744,096.69. Petitioner, on the other hand, insists a one-time application of the 25% surcharge based on the total franchise tax due and unpaid (P10,286,468.57 from 1992 to 2002), arriving at the sum of only P2,571,617.14.<br><br><center><i>This court's ruling </i></center><br>The petition is meritorious.<br><br><b>The trial court's order of execution,<br>as affirmed by the Court of Appeals, <br>exceeded the judgment sought to be <br>executed</b><br><br>Respondent's computation of the surcharge, as sustained by the trial court and the Court of Appeals, varies the terms of the judgment sought to be executed and contravenes Section 168 of the Local Government Code.<br><br>To repeat, respondent computed the surcharge based on the total unpaid tax for each particular year. For example, in 1993, the proper tax due (P821,401.17) was added the unpaid tax due in year 1992 (P808,606.41), obtaining the sum of Pl,630,007.58 as total unpaid tax. To this amount of P1,630,007.58 was applied the 25% surcharge, giving the amount of P407,501.89. In 1994, the proper tax due (P1,075,855.62) was added the unpaid taxes for 1992 and 1993 (P1,630,007.58), yielding a total unpaid tax of P2,705,863.20. To this sum of P2,705,863.20 was applied the 25% surcharge, obtaining the amount of P676,465.80. The same computation was made on the succeeding years up to the year 2002. The surcharges from 1992 to 2002 were added, giving the total amount of P13,744,096.69.

If that was the intention of the Court of Appeals, it should have so expressly stated in the dispositive portion of its decision.<br><br>Respondent contends that in its complaint before the trial court, it prayed that petitioner be ordered to pay the franchise tax due, plus 25% surcharge and 2% monthly interest in accordance with Section 168 of the Local Government Code.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> However, the appellate court allegedly did not award the 2% monthly interest, and the only probable reason why it did not do so notwithstanding the express provision of law was because of Article 1226<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> of the Civil Code stating that the "penalty [25% surcharge] shall substitute the indemnity for damages and the payment of interest in case of non-compliance."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; Hence, it contended that <i>sans</i> the payment of monthly interest, the "one time [sic] imposition of the [surcharge] regardless of the number of years of delay [would] be a great transgression of [its] right."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Respondent's theory is implausible.<br><br>Article 1226 of the Civil Code refers to penalties prescribed in contracts, not to penalties embodied in a judgment.

Hence, when the taxpayer does not pay its tax due for a particular year, then a surcharge is applied on the <i>full</i> amount of the tax due. However, when the taxpayer makes a partial payment of the tax due, the surcharge is applied only on the balance or the part of the tax due that remains unpaid. It is in this sense that the <i>fallo</i> of the Court of Appeals decision should be read, i.e., a 25% surcharge is to be added to the proper franchise tax so <i>due and unpaid</i> for each year.<br><br>The proper franchise tax due each year is computed, with paragraphs 1 and 2 of the <i>fallo</i> being applied, based on the gross receipts earned by NAPOCOR:<br><br><blockquote><table Â ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="90%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="50%"><div align="CENTER"><b>Year</b></div></td> <td width="50%"><div align="CENTER"><b>Tax Due</b></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">1992</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">P 808,606.41</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">1993</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">821,401.17</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">1994</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">1,075,855.62</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">1995</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">1,161,016.63</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">1996</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">449,599.84</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">1997</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">614,608.97</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">1998</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">519,967.33</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">1999</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">238,439.87</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">2000</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">1,030,108.81</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">2001</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">1,851,231.76</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">2002</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER"><u>1,715,632.16</u></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER"><b>Total</b></div></td> <td><div align="CENTER"><b>P10,286,468.57</b><font color="#FF0000"><sup>[41]</sup></font></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>Since the franchise tax due was not paid on time, a surcharge of 25% is imposed as an addition to the main tax required to be paid.&nbsp; This is the proper meaning of paragraph 3 oÃ­ the <i>fallo</i>.

The judgment which was sought to be executed ordered the payment of simple "legal interest" only. It said nothing about the payment of compound interest. Accordingly, when the respondent judge ordered the payment of compound interest he went beyond the confines of his own judgment which had been affirmed by the Court of Appeals and which had become final. Fundamental is the rule that execution must conform to that ordained or decreed in the dispositive part of the decision.

Hence, respondent alone is to blame and should suffer the consequences of its neglect. With the finality of the Court of Appeals' judgment, all the issues between the parties are deemed resolved and laid to rest.

The law allows the local government to collect an interest at the rate not exceeding 2% <i>per month</i> of the unpaid taxes, fees, or charges including surcharges, until such amount is fully paid. However, the law provides that the total interest on the unpaid amount or portion thereof should not exceed thirty-six (36) months or three (3) years.

Hence, respondent's computation of the surcharge is oppressive and unconscionable.<br><br>We conclude that the trial court committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in issuing its order dated October 25, 2004, which adopted respondent's computation and effectively varied the terms of the judgment sought to be executed insofar as it imposed a surcharge of P13,744,096.69 on the total tax due (P10,286,468.57) from 1992 to 2002 instead of only P2,571,617.14.<br><br>Taxes and its surcharges and penalties cannot be construed in such a way as to become oppressive and confiscatory. Taxes are implied burdens that ensure that individuals and businesses prosper in a conducive environment assured by good and effective government. A healthy balance should be maintained such that laws are interpreted in a way that these burdens do not amount to a confiscatory outcome. Taxes are not and should not be construed to drive businesses into insolvency. To a certain extent, a reasonable surcharge will provide incentive to pay; an unreasonable one delays payment and engages government in unnecessary litigation and expense.<br><br>Since it is undisputed that petitioner had already paid the amount of f 12,868,085.71<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> (including litigation expenses of P10,000.00) to the City Treasurer of Cabanatuan City, the judgment has accordingly been fully satisfied.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b> and the Court of Appeals decision and resolution dated January 15, 2007 and April 3, 2007 are <b>REVERSED AND SET ASIDE</b>.

If delays in tax payments are to be condoned for light reasons, the law imposing penalties for delinquencies would be rendered nugatory, and the maintenance of the government and its multifarious activities would be as precarious as tax payers are willing or unwilling to pay their obligations to the state in time.

The court refused, holding that Article 1154 refers to penalties prescribed in contracts; the law directing the collection of 25% surcharge is mandatory on the collector who has no discretion in the matter; and the court cannot equitably modify the penalty.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v.

Court of Appeals,</i> 321 Phil. 1, 29-30 (1995) [Per J. Feliciano, En Banc], this court held that Picop is not liable for surcharge and interest on unpaid transaction tax. According to this court, "the authority to impose what the present Tax Code calls (in Section 248) <i>civil penalties</i> consisting of additions to the tax due, must be expressly given in the enabling statute, in language too clear to be mistaken. The grant of that authority is not lightly to be assumed to have been made to administrative officials, even to one as highly placed as the Secretary of Finance." This court noted that Section 51(c)(l) and (e)(l) and (3) of the 1977 Tax Code authorize the imposition of surcharge and interest only with respect to a "<i>tax imposed by this Title</i>" that is to say, Title II on <i>"Income Tax"</i>; while the 35% transaction tax is imposed by Section 2I0(b) which Section is embraced in Title V on "<i>Taxes on Business</i>" of that Code. While such omission seemed to this court to be an "inadvertent error in legislative draftsmanship," it refrained from filling in such a legislative lacuna.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, p. 488.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Id. at 295-296.</div>
