				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Although case law has repeatedly held that the employer was but a bystander in respect of the conduct of the certification election to decide the labor organization to represent the employees in the bargaining unit, and that the pendency of the cancellation of union registration brought against the labor organization applying for the certification election should not prevent&nbsp; the conduct of the certification election, this review has to look again at the seemingly never-ending quest of the petitioner employer to stop the conduct of the certification election on the ground of the pendency of proceedings to cancel the labor organization’s registration it had initiated on the ground that the membership of the labor organization was a mixture of managerial and supervisory employees with the rank-and-file employees.<br><br>Under review at the instance of the employer is the decision promulgated on December 13, 2005,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> whereby the Court of Appeals (CA) dismissed its petition for <i>certiorari</i> to assail the resolutions of&nbsp; respondent Secretary of Labor and Employment sanctioning the conduct of the certification election initiated by respondent labor organization.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br><center><b>Antecedents</b><br></center><br>On October 11, 1995, respondent National Union of Workers in Hotel Restaurant and Allied Industries-Heritage Hotel Manila Supervisors Chapter (NUWHRAIN-HHMSC) filed a petition for certification election,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> seeking to represent all the supervisory employees of Heritage Hotel Manila.

In fine, <i>Toyota</i> and <i>Dunlop Slazenger </i>are a spent force. Since <i>Tagaytay Highlands</i> was handed down after these two cases, it constitutes the latest expression of the will of the Supreme Court and supersedes or overturns previous rulings inconsistent with it.&nbsp; From this perspective, it is needless to discuss whether<i> SPI Technologies</i> as a mere resolution of the Court may prevail over a full-blown decision that <i>Toyota Motor</i> or <i>Dunlop Slazenger</i> was.&nbsp; The ruling in <i>SPI Technologies </i>has been echoed in <i>Tagaytay Highlands,</i> for which reason it is with <i>Tagaytay Highlands</i>, not <i>SPI Technologies</i>, that the petitioner must joust.<br><br>The fact that the cancellation proceeding has not yet been resolved makes it obvious that the legal personality of the respondent union is still very much in force.&nbsp; The DOLE has thus every reason to proceed with the certification election and commits no grave abuse of discretion in allowing it to prosper because the right to be certified as collective bargaining agent is one of the legitimate privileges of a registered union.&nbsp; It is for the petitioner to expedite the cancellation case if it wants to put an end to the certification case, but it cannot place the issue of the union’s legitimacy in the certification case, for that would be tantamount to making the collateral attack the DOLE has staunchly argued to be impermissible.<br><br>The reference made by the petitioner to another <i>Progressive Development </i>case that it would be more prudent for the DOLE to suspend the certification case until the issue of the legality of the registration is resolved, has also been satisfactorily answered.&nbsp; Section 11, Rule XI of Department Order 9 provides for the grounds for the dismissal of a petition for certification election, and the pendency of a petition for cancellation of union registration is not one of them.&nbsp; Like<i> Toyota Motor</i> and <i>Dunlop Slazenger,</i> the second <i>Progressive </i>case came before Department Order 9.<br><br>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the disputed resolutions of the Secretary of Labor and Employment are AFFIRMED, and the petition is DISMISSED.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br></blockquote><br>The petitioner sought reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> but its motion was denied.<br><br><center><b>Issues</b><br></center><br>Hence, this appeal, with the petitioner insisting that:<br><br><blockquote><center>I</center><br>THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN RULING THAT <i>TAGAYTAY HIGHLANDS</i> APPLIES TO THE CASE AT BAR<br><br><center>II</center><br>[THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS] SERIOUSLY ERRED WHEN IT DISREGARDED <i>PROGRESSIVE DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION – PIZZA HUT V.

Tagaytay Highlands Employees Union-PTGWO</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> (<i>Tagaytay Highlands</i>) was inapplicable because it involved the co-mingling of supervisory and rank-and-file employees in one labor organization, while the issue here related to the mixture of membership between two employee groups — one vested with the right to self-organization (<i>i.e.</i>, the rank-and-file and supervisory employees), and the other deprived of such right (<i>i.e</i>., managerial and confidential employees); that suspension of the certification election was appropriate because a finding of “illegal mixture” of membership during a petition for the cancellation of union registration determined whether or not the union had met the 20% representation requirement under Article 234(c) of the <i>Labor Code</i>; <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> and that in holding that mixed membership was not a ground for canceling the union registration, except when such was done through misrepresentation, false representation or fraud under the circumstances enumerated in Article 239(a) and (c) of the <i>Labor Code</i>, the CA completely ignored the 20% requirement under Article 234(c) of the <i>Labor Code</i>.<br><br>The petitioner posits that the grounds for dismissing a petition for the certification election under Section 11, Rule XI of Department Order No. 9, Series of 1997, were not exclusive because the other grounds available under the <i>Rules of Court</i> could be invoked; that in <i>Progressive Development Corporation v. Secretary, Department of Labor and Employment</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> the Court ruled that prudence could justify the suspension of the certification election proceedings until the issue of the legality of the union registration could be finally resolved; that the non-submission of the annual financial statements and the list of members in the period from 1996 to 1999 constituted a serious challenge to NUWHRAIN-HHMSC’s right to file its petition for the certification election; and that from the time of the conduct of the certification election on June 23, 2000, the composition of NUWHRAIN-HHMSC had substantially changed, thereby necessitating another certification election to determine the true will of the bargaining unit.<br><br>In short, should the petition for the cancellation of union registration based on mixed membership of supervisors and managers in a labor union, and the non-submission of reportorial requirements to the DOLE justify the suspension of the proceedings for the certification elections or even the denial of the petition for the certification election?<br><br><center><b>Ruling</b></center><br>We deny the petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>.<br><br>Basic in the realm of labor union rights is that the certification election is the sole concern of the workers,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> and the employer is deemed an intruder as far as the certification election is concerned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Thus, the petitioner&nbsp; lacked the legal personality to assail the proceedings for the certification election,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> and should stand aside as a mere bystander who could not oppose the petition, or even appeal the Med-Arbiter’s orders relative to the conduct of the certification election.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> As the Court has explained in <i>Republic v. Kawashima Textile Mfg., Philippines, Inc</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>(Kawashima):<br><br><blockquote>Except when it is requested to bargain collectively, an employer is a mere bystander to any petition for certification election; such proceeding is non-adversarial and merely investigative, for the purpose thereof is to determine which organization will represent the employees in their collective bargaining with the employer. The choice of their representative is the exclusive concern of the employees; the employer cannot have any partisan interest therein; it cannot interfere with, much less oppose, the process by filing a motion to dismiss or an appeal from it; not even a mere allegation that some employees participating in a petition for certification election are actually managerial employees will lend an employer legal personality to block the certification election. The employer's only right in the proceeding is to be notified or informed thereof.</blockquote><br>The petitioner’s meddling in the conduct of the certification election among its employees unduly gave rise to the suspicion that it intended to establish a company union.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> For that reason, the challenges it posed against the certification election proceedings were rightly denied.<br><br>Under the long established rule, too, the filing of the petition for the cancellation of NUWHRAIN-HHMSC’s registration should not bar the conduct of the certification election.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> In that respect, only a final order for the cancellation of the registration would have prevented NUWHRAIN-HHMSC from continuing to enjoy all the rights conferred on it as a legitimate labor union, including the right to the petition for the certification election.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> This rule is now enshrined in Article 238-A of the Labor Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 9481,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> which reads:<br><br><blockquote>Article 238-A. <i>Effect of a Petition for Cancellation of Registration. </i>– A petition for cancellation of union registration shall not suspend the proceedings for certification election nor shall it prevent the filing of a petition for certification election.<br><br>x x x x<br></blockquote><br>Still, the petitioner assails the failure of NUWHRAIN-HHMSC to submit its periodic financial reports and updated list of its members pursuant to Article 238 and Article 239 of the <i>Labor Code</i>. It contends that the serious challenges against the legitimacy of NUWHRAIN-HHMSC as a union raised in the petition for the cancellation of union registration should have cautioned the Med-Arbiter against conducting the certification election.<br><br>The petitioner does not convince us.<br><br>In <i>The Heritage Hotel Manila v. National Union of Workers in the Hotel, Restaurant and Allied Industries-Heritage Hotel Manila Supervisors Chapter (NUWHRAIN-HHMSC),</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> the Court declared that the dismissal of the petition for the cancellation of the registration of NUWHRAIN-HHMSC was proper when viewed against the primordial right of the workers to self-organization, collective bargaining negotiations and peaceful concerted actions, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>[Articles 238 and 239 of the Labor Code] give the Regional Director ample discretion in dealing with a petition for cancellation of a union's registration, particularly, determining whether the union still meets the requirements prescribed by law. It is sufficient to give the Regional Director license to treat the late filing of required documents as sufficient compliance with the requirements of the law. After all, the law requires the labor organization to submit the annual financial report and list of members in order to verify if it is still viable and financially sustainable as an organization so as to protect the employer and employees from fraudulent or fly-by-night unions. With the submission of the required documents by respondent, the purpose of the law has been achieved, though belatedly.<br><br>We cannot ascribe abuse of discretion to the Regional Director and the DOLE Secretary in denying the petition for cancellation of respondent's registration. The union members and, in fact, all the employees belonging to the appropriate bargaining unit should not be deprived of a bargaining agent, merely because of the negligence of the union officers who were responsible for the submission of the documents to the BLR.<br><br>Labor authorities should, indeed, act with circumspection in treating petitions for cancellation of union registration, lest they be accused of interfering with union activities. In resolving the petition, consideration must be taken of the fundamental rights guaranteed by Article XIII, Section 3 of the Constitution, i.e., the rights of all workers to self-organization, collective bargaining and negotiations, and peaceful concerted activities. Labor authorities should bear in mind that registration confers upon a union the status of legitimacy and the concomitant right and privileges granted by law to a legitimate labor organization, particularly the right to participate in or ask for certification election in a bargaining unit. Thus, the cancellation of a certificate of registration is the equivalent of snuffing out the <i>life </i>of a labor organization. For without such registration, it loses - as a rule - its rights under the Labor Code.<br><br>It is worth mentioning that the Labor Code's provisions on cancellation of union registration and on reportorial requirements have been recently amended by Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9481,<i> An Act Strengthening the Workers’ Constitutional Right to Self-Organization, Amending for the Purpose Presidential Decree No. 442, As Amended, Otherwise Known as the Labor Code of the Philippines</i>, which lapsed into law on May 25, 2007 and became effective on June 14, 2007. The amendment sought to strengthen the workers’ right to self-organization and enhance the Philippines' compliance with its international obligations as embodied in the International Labor Organization (ILO) Convention No. 87, pertaining to the non-dissolution of workers’ organizations by administrative authority. Thus, R.A. No. 9481 amended Article 239 to read:<br><br><blockquote>ART. 239. Grounds for Cancellation of Union Registration.--The following may constitute grounds for cancellation of union registration:<br><br>(a) Misrepresentation, false statement or fraud in connection with the adoption or ratification of the constitution and by-laws or amendments thereto, the minutes of ratification, and the list of members who took part in the ratification;<br><br>(b) Misrepresentation, false statements or fraud in connection with the election of officers, minutes of the election of officers, and the list of voters;<br><br>(c) Voluntary dissolution by the members.</blockquote>R.A. No. 9481 also inserted in the Labor Code Article 242-A, which provides:<br><blockquote>ART. 242-A. Reportorial Requirements.--The following are documents required to be submitted to the Bureau by the legitimate labor organization concerned:<br><br>(a) Its constitution and by-laws, or amendments thereto, the minutes of ratification, and the list of members who took part in the ratification of the constitution and by-laws within thirty (30) days from adoption or ratification of the constitution and by-laws or amendments thereto;<br><br>(b) Its list of officers, minutes of the election of officers, and list of voters within thirty (30) days from election;<br><br>(c) Its annual financial report within thirty (30) days after the close of every fiscal year; and<br><br>(d) Its list of members at least once a year or whenever required by the Bureau.<br><br><b>Failure to comply with the above requirements shall not be a ground for cancellation of union registration but shall subject the erring officers or members to suspension, expulsion from membership, or any appropriate penalty.</b><br><br>x x x x</blockquote></blockquote><br>The ruling thereby wrote <i>finis</i> to the challenge being posed by the petitioner against the illegitimacy of NUWHRAIN-HHMSC.<br><br>The remaining issue to be resolved is which among <i>Toyota Motor, Dunlop Slazenger</i> and <i>Tagaytay Highlands</i> applied in resolving the dispute arising from the mixed membership in NUWHRAIN-HHMSC.<br><br>This is not a novel matter. In <i>Kawashima</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> we have reconciled our rulings in <i>Toyota Motor, Dunlop Slazenger </i>and <i>Tagaytay Highlands</i> by emphasizing on the laws prevailing at the time of filing of the petition for the certification election.<br><br><i>Toyota Motor </i>and<i> Dunlop Slazenger</i> involved petitions for certification election filed on November 26, 1992 and September 15, 1995, respectively. In both cases, we applied the Rules and Regulations Implementing R.A. No. 6715 (also known as the <i>1989 Amended Omnibus Rules</i>), the prevailing rule then.<br><br>The <i>1989 Amended Omnibus Rules </i>was amended on June 21, 1997 by Department Order No. 9, Series of 1997. Among the amendments was the removal of the requirement of indicating in the petition for the certification election that there was no co-mingling of rank-and-file and supervisory employees in the membership of the labor union. This was the prevailing rule when the Court promulgated <i>Tagaytay Highlands</i>, declaring therein that mixed membership should have no bearing on the legitimacy of a registered labor organization, unless the co-mingling was due to misrepresentation, false statement or fraud as provided in Article 239 of the Labor Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Presently, then, the mixed membership does not result in the illegitimacy of the registered labor union unless the same was done through misrepresentation, false statement or fraud according to Article 239 of the Labor Code. In <i>Air Philippines Corporation v. Bureau of Labor Relations,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> we categorically explained that—<br><br><blockquote>Clearly, then, for the purpose of de-certifying a union, it is not enough to establish that the rank-and-file union includes ineligible employees in its membership. Pursuant to Article 239 (a) and (c) of the Labor Code, it must be shown that there was misrepresentation, false statement or fraud in connection with the adoption or ratification of the constitution and by-laws or amendments thereto, the minutes of ratification, or in connection with the election of officers, minutes of the election of officers, the list of voters, or failure to submit these documents together with the list of the newly elected-appointed officers and their postal addresses to the BLR.</blockquote><br>We note that NUWHRAIN-HHMSC filed its petition for the certification election on October 11, 1995. Conformably with <i>Kawashima</i>, the applicable law was the 1989 Amended Omnibus Rules, and the prevailing rule was the pronouncement in <i>Toyota Motor</i> and <i>Dunlop Slazenger </i>to the effect that a labor union of mixed membership was not possessed with the requisite personality to file a petition for the certification election.<br><br>Nonetheless, we still rule in favor of NUWHRAIN-HHMSC. We expound.<br><br>In both <i>Toyota Motor</i> and <i>Dunlop Slazenger,</i> the Court was convinced that the concerned labor unions were comprised by mixed rank-and-file and supervisory employees. In <i>Toyota Motor,</i> the employer submitted the job descriptions of the concerned employees to prove that there were supervisors in the petitioning union for rank-and-file employees. In <i>Dunlop Slazenger</i>, the Court observed that the labor union of supervisors included employees occupying positions that apparently belonged to the rank-and-file. In both <i>Toyota Motor </i>and <i>Dunlop Slazenger</i>, the employers were able to adduce substantial evidence to prove the existence of the mixed membership. Based on the records herein, however, the petitioner failed in that respect. To recall, it raised the issue of the mixed membership in its comment on the list of members submitted by NUWHRAIN-HHMSC, and in its protest. In the comment, it merely identified the positions that were either confidential or managerial, but did not present any supporting evidence to prove or explain the identification. In the protest, it only enumerated the positions that were allegedly confidential and managerial, and identified two employees that belonged to the rank-and-file, but did not offer any description to show that the positions belonged to different employee groups.<br><br>Worth reiterating is that the actual functions of an employee, not his job designation, determined whether the employee occupied a managerial, supervisory or rank-and-file position.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> As to confidential employees who were excluded from the right to self-organization, they must (1) assist or act in a confidential capacity, in regard (2) to persons who formulated, determined, and effectuated management policies in the field of labor relations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> In that regard, mere allegations sans substance would not be enough, most especially because the constitutional right of workers to self-organization would be compromised.<br><br>At any rate, the members of NUWHRAIN-HHSMC had already spoken, and elected it as the bargaining agent. As between the rigid application of <i>Toyota Motors </i>and <i>Dunlop Slazenger</i>, and the right of the workers to self-organization, we prefer the latter. For us, the choice is clear and settled. “What is important is that there is an unmistakeable intent of the members of [the] union to exercise their right to organize.
