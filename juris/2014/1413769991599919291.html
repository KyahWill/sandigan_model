Menzon, Regional Director of the Home Development Mutual Fund (Pag-IBIG), requested the intervention of Executive Judge Sinforiano A. Monsanto (Executive Judge Monsanto) of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Catbalogan, Samar on the alleged anomalous auction sale conducted by Sheriff IV Lorenzo De Guzman (De Guzman).&nbsp; According to Pag-IBIG, De Guzman previously acceded to its request to move the date of the auction sale to January 20, 2004; however, to its surprise, the sale proceeded as originally scheduled on January 15, 2004.&nbsp; Pag-IBIG also claimed that the winning bid of Leoncio Lim (Leoncio) in the amount of P500,000.00 was grossly disadvantageous to the government considering that the outstanding loan obligations of the mortgagor, Eduardo Monsanto (Eduardo), was more than the bid amount.&nbsp; Pag-IBIG thus manifested that –<br><br><blockquote>It is for this reason that we are making this protest.&nbsp; Sheriff de Guzman failed to comply with our request for deferment despite his [acquiescence].&nbsp; We are requesting for your intervention to nullify the results of the auction sale conducted last January 15, 2004.&nbsp; This will give our office a chance to be able to participate and recoup our investment.<br><br>We trust that you will give this matter preferential attention.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></blockquote><br>Executive Judge Monsanto refrained from acting on the letter considering that Eduardo is his relative; instead he re-assigned the same to Judge Sibanah E.

Cesar Lee argued on behalf of Pag-IBIG; and that Pascual Monsanto (Pascual) appeared on behalf of Eduardo.&nbsp; However, Judge Usman noted that no formal petition or complaint was actually filed which presents a judicial issue; moreover, the acts complained of partake of administrative matter.&nbsp; Consequently, Judge Usman referred the matter to the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) for further action.<br><br>Subsequently, Pascual filed with the OCA, copy furnished the RTC-Catbalogan, Samar, Branches 27 and 28, a <i>Motion to Lift Writ of Execution and Notice to Vacate</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> dated March 13, 2004.&nbsp; Pascual alleged that on March 5, 2005, De Guzman, Sheriff of Branch 27, issued a Notice to Vacate; that the same is being enforced with grave threats and harassment; that the protest of Pag-IBIG remains pending with and unresolved by OCA; that the trial court did not transmit the records of the case to the OCA; that the winning bid of P500,000.00 submitted by Leoncio is disadvantangeous to the government; that Eduardo’s loan with Pag-IBIG is being proposed for restructuring; and that the writ of execution and notice to vacate would gravely prejudice their rights.&nbsp; Pascual thus prayed that:<br><br><ol type="A"><li>An order be issued lifting the Writ of Execution and the Notice to Vacate;<br><br></li><li>An order be issued enjoining or restraining the subject Sheriff from enforcing the said Notice to vacate; and<br><br></li><li>Court officials or personnel above mentioned be made to explain respecting the handling of the above captioned case as cited above, and if found negligent be so sanctioned in accordance with the law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></li></ol><br>Acting on the aforesaid <i>Motion to Lift Writ of Execution and Notice to Vacate</i>, the OCA, in a letter<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> dated May 9, 2005 directed Judge Usman to –<br><br><blockquote>(1) conduct an investigation on the missing records of ‘Home Development Mutual Fund (Pag-IBIG) vs. Eduardo Monsanto’ and to report thereon within THIRTY (30) days from notice; and (2) take action on (a) Items A and B of the ‘Motion to Lift Writ of Execution and Notice to Vacate’ and (b) the letter of Home Development Mutual Fund dated 18 February 2004, a copy of which is annexed to the ‘Motion to Lift Writ of Execution and Notice to Vacate’, herewith attached.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></blockquote><br>Pursuant to the above directive, Judge Usman notified Pag-IBIG, Eduardo, and Leoncio of a hearing scheduled on June 14, 2005.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; This time, the case was captioned as “<i>Home Development Mutual Fund (Pag-IBIG Fund), mortgagee, v.

Labid being meritorious should be given due course.&nbsp; On the other hand, the motion to lift writ of execution and notice to vacate filed by Rev. Fr. Pascual D. Monsanto, Jr. being devoid of merit should be denied.<br><br>Atty. Cesar E. Lee filed a manifestation dated June 7, 2005, praying that an order be issued directing Lorenzo de Guzman, Sheriff to make the necessary notice to all concern[ed] of the fact that the mortgagee has restructured his loan with the mortgagor, and in effect, redeemed his obligation subject matter of this foreclosure proceeding.<br><br>Mr. De Guzman explained that even assuming that there was restructuring of the [mortgage] loan it is very clear that it was done after the lapse of the one (1) year redemption period and also there was no notice given to the Office of the Clerk of Court.&nbsp; Moreover, if there was actual payment the Office of the Clerk of Court was never x x x informed by Mr. Monsanto.<br><br>WHEREFORE, premises considered, this Court finds that the instant motion to lift writ of execution and notice to vacate the [premises] is devoid of merit, hence denied; likewise the manifestation of Atty.

CEB SP No. 01343.&nbsp; They claimed that the RTC committed grave abuse of discretion in denying their Motion to Lift Writ of Execution and Notice to Vacate and in granting Lim’s Ex Parte Motion for Issuance of Writ of Possession through its July 1, 2005 Order, arguing that Lim’s motion was not made under oath; that there are third parties in possession of the subject property; that they were not notified of the confirmation of the sale; that the mere filing of the Certificate of Sale with the Register of Deeds without presenting the owner’s duplicate copy is not tantamount to registration; that since the Certificate of Sale was not registered, then the period to redeem did not begin to run; that De Guzman’s March 7, 2005 Notice to Vacate was illegal, since at the time, no writ of possession was yet issued; that De Guzman’s actions in enforcing the writ of possession on July 8 and 15, 2005 – while their motion for reconsideration was pending – is inhuman and violated their constitutional rights; and that out of justice and equity, they should be allowed to redeem the property.&nbsp; Petitioners prayed for the reversal of the RTC’s July 1, 2005 and August 30, 2005 Orders and for the CA to restore the <i>status quo ante</i>.<br><br>On March 12, 2007, the CA issued the assailed Decision finding no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the RTC and affirming its July 1, 2005 and August 30, 2005 Orders, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>ACCORDINGLY, in line with the foregoing disquisitions, the petition is hereby DENIED.&nbsp; The assailed Orders dated 1 July 2005 and 30 August 2005 are AFFIRMED IN TOTO.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></blockquote><br>Petitioners filed their Motion for Reconsideration, which the CA denied in its assailed July 6, 2007 Resolution.<br><br>Hence, the present Petition.<br><br><center><b>Issues</b></center><br>Petitioners raise the following grounds for the Petition:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS 20<sup>TH</sup> DIVISION, CEBU CITY ERRED IN RULING THAT NO GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION WAS COMMITTED BY THE HONORABLE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT BRANCH 27, EIGHTH JUDICIAL REGION, CATBALOGAN, SAMAR IN ITS ISSUANCE OF THE WRIT OF POSSESSION AND ITS ISSUANCE DOES NOT NEED A MOTION FOR THE CONFIRMATION OF SALE WHICH REQUIRES A HEARING;<br><br></li><li>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS 20TH DIVISION, CEBU CITY ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE CERTIFICATE OF SALE WAS REGISTERED OR THAT THE MERE FILING WITH THE REGISTER OF DEEDS OF THE SAME IS TANTAMOUNT TO ITS REGISTRATION, THUS THE REDEMPTION PERIOD HAD STARTED TO RUN, ON THE COURT’S CONJECTURE THAT P.D. 1529 IMPLIEDLY REPEALED ACT NO. 3135, PARTICULARLY SECTION 6, THEREOF;<br><br></li><li>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS 20TH DIVISION, CEBU CITY ERRED IN AFFIRMING THE COURT A QUO’S FINDINGS THAT ALL THE PETITIONERS WERE DULY NOTIFIED BUT FAILED TO APPEAR DURING THE HEARING ON THE MOTION FOR THE ISSUANCE OF THE WRIT OF POSSESSION.&nbsp; IT ERRED IN ALLUDING THAT IN THE COURSE OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THIS INSTANT CASE, PETITIONERS WERE NOT DENIED DUE PROCESS OF LAW; AND<br><br></li><li>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS 20TH DIVISION, CEBU CITY ERRED IN RULING THAT PETITIONERS DECOROSO AND FR.

However, said letter could not in any way be considered as a pleading.&nbsp; Section 1, Rule 6 of the Rules of Court defines pleadings as “written statements of the respective claims and defenses of the parties submitted to the court for appropriate judgment.” To stress, Pag-IBIG’s letter could not be considered as a formal complaint or petition.&nbsp; <i>First, </i>the parties to the case were not identified pursuant to Section 1,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Rule 3 and Section 1,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Rule 7.&nbsp; <i>Second</i>, the so-called claim or cause of action was not properly mentioned or specified. <i>Third</i>, the letter miserably failed to comply with the requirements of Rule 7, Rules of Court.&nbsp; The letter bore no caption; it was not even assigned a docket number; the parties were not properly identified; the allegations were not properly set forth; no particular relief is sought; in fact, only the intervention of Executive Judge Monsanto is requested; it was not signed by a counsel; and most of all, there is no verification or certification against forum-shopping.<br><br>We have also noted that in its July 1, 2005 Order, Judge Usman of Branch 28 resolved the following incidents: (1) the motion for issuance of writ of possession filed by Leoncio; and (2) the motion to lift writ of execution and notice to vacate.&nbsp; However, the said <i>Manifestation with Ex Parte Motion for Issuance of Writ of Possession </i>was not even filed before Branch 28; in fact, it was submitted for consideration of Branch 27.&nbsp; Moreover, the Motion to Lift Writ of Execution and Notice to Vacate was filed by Pascual before the OCA; the RTC Branches 27 and 28 of Catbalogan, Samar, were only furnished copies thereof.<br><br>In addition, it is quite unfortunate that Judge Usman proceeded to take cognizance of the case notwithstanding his prior observation as stated in the May 3, 2004 Order that no formal petition or complaint was actually filed and which presents a judicial issue.&nbsp; In fact, Judge Usman even opined that the acts complained of partake of administrative matter and thus referred the same to the OCA for further action.&nbsp; The May 9, 2005 letter of OCA directing Judge Usman to take action on the<i> Motion to Lift Writ of Execution and Notice to Vacate</i> could not be interpreted as vesting Judge Usman with the authority and jurisdiction to take cognizance of the matter.&nbsp; Nothing to that effect could be inferred from the tenor of the May 9, 2005 letter of OCA.&nbsp; Jurisdiction is vested by law.&nbsp; When OCA directed Judge Usman to take action on the <i>Motion to Lift Writ of Execution and Notice to Vacate</i>, it did not deprive the latter of his discretion to dismiss the matter/case for lack of jurisdiction, if the matter/case so warrants.<br><br>In fine, there being no proper initiatory pleading filed, then the RTC Branch 28 did not acquire jurisdiction over the matter/case.<br><br><b><i>No payment of docket fees.</i></b><br><br>We have also noted that no docket fees were paid before the trial court.&nbsp; Section 1, Rule 141 of the Rules of Court mandates that “[u]pon the filing of the pleading or other application which initiates an action or proceeding, the fees prescribed therefor shall be paid in full.”&nbsp; “It is hornbook law that courts acquire jurisdiction over a case only upon payment of the prescribed docket fee.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br><i>In Far East Bank and Trust Company v. Shemberg Marketing Corporation</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> we ruled thus:<br><br><blockquote>A court acquires jurisdiction over a case only upon the payment of the prescribed fees.&nbsp; The importance of filing fees cannot be gainsaid for these are intended to take care of court expenses in the handling of cases in terms of costs of supplies, use of equipment, salaries and fringe benefits of personnel, and others, computed as to man-hours used in the handling of each case.&nbsp; Hence, the non-payment or insufficient payment of docket fees can entail tremendous losses to government in general and to the judiciary in particular.<br></blockquote><br>In fine, since no docket or filing fees were paid, then the RTC Branch 28 did not acquire jurisdiction over the matter/case.&nbsp; It therefore erred in taking cognizance of the same. Consequently, all the proceedings undertaken by the trial court are null and void, and without force and effect.&nbsp; In, particular, the July 1, 2005 and August 30, 2005 Orders of the RTC are null and void.<br><br>It is settled jurisprudence that “[a]ny decision rendered without jurisdiction is a total nullity and may be struck down at any time, even on appeal before this Court.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Prescinding from the foregoing, we hold that the RTC-Branch 28 did not acquire jurisdiction over the instant matter/case there being no formal initiatory pleading filed as well as non-payment of docket fees. Consequently, all proceedings had before the RTC Branch 28 were null and void for lack of jurisdiction.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is <b>DENIED</b>.&nbsp; The assailed March 12, 2007 Decision and July 6, 2007 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
