Thus, since FI had yet to pay the same, DBP’s obligation to Union Bank had not arisen.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> In addition, DBP sought to implead FW as third party-defendant in its capacity as FI’s assignee and, thus, should be held liable to Union Bank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>In the interim, or on May 6, 1988, DBP filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that it had ceased to be a real-party-in-interest due to the supervening transfer of its rights, title and interests over the subject matter to the Asset Privatization Trust (APT). Said motion was, however, denied by the RTC in an Order dated May 27, 1988.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br><center><b>The RTC Ruling in Civil Case No. 7648</b></center><br>Finding the complaint to be meritorious, the RTC, in a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> dated May 8, 1990, ordered: (<i>a</i>) DBP to pay Union Bank the sum of P4,019,033.59, representing the amount of the subject rentals (which, again, constitutes 30% of FI’s [now FW’s] total rental debt), including interest until fully paid; and (<i>b</i>) FW, as third-party defendant, to indemnify DBP, as third-party plaintiff, for its payments of the subject rentals to Union Bank. It ruled that there lies no evidence which would show that DBP’s receipt of the rental payments from FW is a condition precedent to the former’s obligation to remit the subject rentals under the Lease Agreement. Thus, when DBP failed to remit the subject rentals to Union Bank, it defaulted on its assumed obligations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> DBP then elevated the case on appeal before the CA, docketed as CA-G.R. CV No. 35866.<br><br><center><b>The CA Ruling in CA-G.R.

Nevertheless, the monthly installments in satisfaction of the assumed obligations <b>would still have to be first sourced from said lease rentals as stipulated in the assumption agreement</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> In view of the foregoing, the CA ruled that DBP did not default in its obligations to remit the subject rentals to Union Bank <b>precisely because it had yet to receive the rental payments of FW</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Separately, the CA upheld the RTC’s denial of DBP’s motion to dismiss for the reason that the transfer of its rights, title and interests over the subject matter to the APT occurred <i>pendente lite</i>, and, as such, the substitution of parties is largely discretionary on the part of the court.<br><br>At odds with the CA’s ruling, Union Bank and DBP filed separate petitions for review on <i>certiorari</i> before the Court, respectively docketed as G.R.

Nos. 115963 &amp; 119112</b></center><br>The Court denied both petitions in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> dated December 13, 1995. First, it upheld the CA’s finding that while DBP directly assumed FI’s obligations to Union Bank, DBP was only obliged to remit&nbsp; to the latter 30% of the lease rentals collected from FW, from which any deficiency was to be settled by DBP not later than December 29, 1998.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Similarly, the Court agreed with the CA that the denial of DBP’s motion to dismiss was proper since substitution of parties, in case of transfers <i>pendente lite</i>, is merely discretionary on the part of the court, adding further that the proposed substitution of APT will amount to a novation of debtor which cannot be done without the consent of the creditor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>On August 2, 2000, the Court’s resolution became final and executory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br><center><b>The RTC Execution Proceedings</b></center><br>On May 16, 2001, Union Bank filed a motion for execution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> before the RTC, praying that DBP be directed to pay the amount of P9,732,420.555 which represents the amount of the subject rentals (<i>i.e.</i>, 30% of the FW’s total rental debt in the amount of P32,441,401.85). DBP opposed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Union Bank’s motion, contending that it sought to effectively vary the dispositive portion of the CA’s May 27, 1994 Decision in CA-G.R. CV No. 35866. Also, on September 12, 2001, DBP filed its own motion for execution against FW, citing the same CA decision as its basis.<br><br>In a Consolidated Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> dated October 15, 2001 (Order of Execution), the RTC granted both motions for execution. Anent Union Bank’s motion, the RTC opined that the CA’s ruling that DBP’s payment to Union Bank shall be demandable only upon payment of FW must be viewed in light of the date when the same was rendered. It noted that the CA decision was promulgated only on May 27, 1994, which was before the December 29, 1998 due date within which DBP had to fully pay its obligation to Union Bank under the Assumption Agreement. Since the latter period had already lapsed, “[i]t would, thus, be too strained to argue that payment by DBP of its assumed obligation[s] shall be dependent on [FW’s] ability, if not availability, to pay.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> In similar regard, the RTC granted DBP’s motion for execution against FW since its liability to Union Bank and DBP remained undisputed.<br><br>As a result, a writ of execution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> dated October 15, 2001 (October 15, 2001 Writ of Execution) and, thereafter, a notice of garnishment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> against DBP were issued. Records, however, do not show that the same writ was implemented against FW.<br><br>DBP filed a motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> from the Execution Order, averring that the latter issuance varied the import of the CA’s May 27, 1994 Decision in CA-G.R. CV No. 35866 in that it prematurely ordered DBP to pay the assumed obligations to Union Bank before FW’s payment. The motion was, however, denied on December 5, 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Thus, DBP’s deposits were eventually garnished.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Aggrieved, DBP filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> before the CA, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 68300.<br><br><center><b>The CA Ruling in CA-G.R. SP No. 68300</b></center><br>In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> dated July 26, 2002, the CA dismissed DBP’s petition, finding that the RTC did not abuse its discretion when it issued the October 15, 2001 Writ of Execution. It upheld the RTC’s observation that there was “nothing wrong in the manner how [said writ] was implemented,” as well as “in the zealousness and promptitude exhibited by Union Bank” in moving for the same. DBP appealed the CA’s ruling before the Court, which was docketed as G.R. No. 155838.<br><br><center><b>The Court’s Ruling in G.R. No. 155838</b></center><br>In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> dated January 13, 2004 (January 13, 2004 Decision), the Court granted DBP’s appeal, and thereby reversed and set aside the CA’s ruling in CA-G.R. SP No. 68300. It found significant points of variance between the CA’s May 27, 1994 Decision in CA-G.R. CV No. 35866, and the RTC’s Order of Execution/October 15, 2001 Writ of Execution. It ruled that both the body and the dispositive portion of the same decision acknowledged that DBP’s obligation to Union Bank for remittance of the lease payments is contingent on FW’s prior payment to DBP, and that any deficiency DBP had to pay by December 29, 1998 as per the Assumption Agreement cannot be determined until after the satisfaction of FW’s own rental obligations to DBP. Accordingly, the Court: (<i>a</i>)&nbsp; nullified the October 15, 2001 Writ of Execution and all related issuances thereto; and (<i>b</i>) ordered Union Bank to return to DBP the amounts it received pursuant to the said writ.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Dissatisfied, Union Bank moved for reconsideration which was, however, denied by the Court in a Resolution dated March 24, 2004 with finality. Thus, the January 13, 2004 Decision attained finality on April 30, 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Thereafter, DBP moved for the execution of the said decision before the RTC. After numerous efforts on the part of Union Bank proved futile, the RTC issued a writ of execution (September 6, 2005 Writ of Execution), ordering Union Bank to return to DBP all funds it received pursuant to the October 15, 2001 Writ of Execution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br><center><b>Union Bank’s Motion to Affirm Legal Compensation</b></center><br>On September 13, 2005, Union Bank filed a Manifestation and Motion to Affirm Legal Compensation,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> praying that the RTC apply legal compensation between itself and DBP in order to offset the return of the funds it previously received from DBP. Union Bank anchored its motion on two grounds which were allegedly not in existence prior to or during trial, namely: (a) on December 29, 1998, DBP’s assumed obligations became due and demandable;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> and (b) considering that FWI became non-operational and non-existent, DBP became primarily liable to the balance of its assumed obligation, which as of Union Bank’s computation <b>after its claimed set-off</b>, amounted to P1,849,391.87.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>On November 9, 2005, the RTC issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> denying the above-mentioned motion for lack of merit, holding that Union Bank’s stated grounds were already addressed by the Court in the January 13, 2004 Decision in G.R. No. 155838. With Union Bank’s motion for reconsideration therefrom having been denied, it filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> with the CA, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 93833.<br><br>Pending resolution, Union Bank issued Manager’s Check<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> No. 099-0003192363 dated April 21, 2006 amounting to P52,427,250.00 in favor of DBP, in satisfaction of the Writ of Execution dated September 6, 2005 Writ of Execution. DBP, however, averred that Union Bank still has a balance of P756,372.39 representing a portion of the garnished funds of DBP,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> which means that said obligation had not been completely extinguished.<br><br><center><b>The CA Ruling in CA-G.R. SP No. 93833</b></center><br>In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> dated November 3, 2009, the CA dismissed Union Bank’s petition, finding no grave abuse of discretion on the RTC’s part. It affirmed the denial of its motion to affirm legal compensation considering that: (<i>a</i>) the RTC only implemented the Court’s January 13, 2004 Decision in G.R. No. 155838 which by then had already attained finality; (<i>b</i>) DBP is not a debtor of Union Bank; and (<i>c</i>) there is neither a demandable nor liquidated debt from DBP to Union Bank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>Undaunted, Union Bank moved for reconsideration which was, however, denied in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> dated February 26, 2010; hence, the instant petition.<br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b></center><br>The sole issue for the Court’s resolution is whether or not the CA correctly upheld the denial of Union Bank’s motion to affirm legal compensation.<br><br><center><b>The Court’s Ruling</b></center><br>The petition is bereft of merit.<br><br>Compensation is defined as a mode of extinguishing obligations whereby two persons in their capacity as principals are mutual debtors and creditors of each other with respect to equally liquidated and demandable obligations to which no retention or controversy has been timely commenced and communicated by third parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>&nbsp; The requisites therefor are provided under Article 1279 of the Civil Code which reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Art. 1279.&nbsp; In order that compensation may be proper, it is necessary:<br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">(1)</div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="JUSTIFY">That each one of the obligors be bound principally, and that he be at the same time a principal creditor of the other;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(2)</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">That both debts consist in a sum of money, or if the things due are consumable, they be of the same kind, and also of the same quality if the latter has been stated;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><b><u>(3)</u></b></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><b><u>That the two debts be due;</u></b></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><u><b>(4)</b></u></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><u><b>That they be liquidated and demandable;</b></u></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(5)</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">That over neither of them there be any retention or controversy, commenced by third persons and communicated in due time to the debtor.

However, legal compensation could not have taken place between these debts for the apparent reason that <b><u>requisites 3 and 4 under Article 1279 of the Civil Code are not present</u></b>. Since DBP’s assumed obligations to Union Bank for remittance of the lease payments are – in the Court’s words in its Decision dated January 13, 2004 in G.R. No. 155838 – <b>“contingent on the prior payment thereof by [FW] to DBP,”</b> it cannot be said that both debts are due (requisite 3 of Article 1279 of the Civil Code). Also, in the same ruling, the Court observed that any deficiency that DBP had to make up (by December 29, 1998 as per the Assumption Agreement) for the full satisfaction of the assumed obligations <b>“cannot be determined until after the satisfaction of Foodmasters’ obligation to DBP.”</b> In this regard, it cannot be concluded that the same debt had already been liquidated, and thereby became demandable (requisite 4 of Article 1279 of the Civil Code).<br><br>The aforementioned Court decision had already attained finality on April 30, 2004<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> and, hence, pursuant to the <b>doctrine of conclusiveness of judgment</b>, the facts and issues actually and directly resolved therein may not be raised in any future case between the same parties, even if the latter suit may involve a different cause of action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Its pertinent portions are hereunder quoted for ready reference:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Both the body and the dispositive portion of the [CA’s May 27, 1994 Decision in CA-G.R.

In this sense, it is correct to say that the means of repayment of the assumed obligation is not limited to the lease rentals.
