These personalities identified by the whistle-blowers allegedly transacted with or attended Mrs. Napoles’ parties and events, among whom is incumbent Sandiganbayan Associate Justice Gregory S. Ong, herein respondent.<br><br>Benhur Luy (Luy), a cousin of Mrs. Napoles who had worked for several years with the Napoleses, filed illegal detention charges against Mrs. Napoles who accused him of double-dealing.&nbsp; When Luy went public with his story about Mrs. Napoles’ anomalous transactions and before the warrant of arrest was issued by the court, she reportedly tried to reach out to the other whistle-blowers for them not to testify against her but instead point to Luy as the one receiving and distributing the money.<br><br>Marina Sula (Sula) executed a Sworn Statement<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> before the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) on August 29, 2013, part of which reads:<br><br><blockquote>32.&nbsp; In the sixteen (16) years that I worked with Ms. Napoles, I witnessed several personalities visit our offices and join us as our special guests during our parties and other special occasions.<br><br>33.&nbsp; These personalities who would either visit our office or join our events and affairs are: Senator Franklin Drilon, Senator Jinggoy Estrada and family, Senator Bong Revilla, Lani Mercado-Revilla, Bryan Revilla, Secretary Rene Villa, Congressman Pichay and Wife, Congressman Plaza, Congressman Ducut, DAR Director Theresita Panlilio, Catherine Mae Canlas Santos, Pauline Labayen, Jen Corpuz (Staff of Senator Sotto), Mayor Rene Maglanque, Atty.

The reporter had interviewed respondent who quickly denied knowing Mrs. Napoles and recalled that the photograph was probably taken in one of the parties frequently hosted by Senator Estrada who is his longtime friend.&nbsp; Respondent also supposedly admitted that given the ongoing pork barrel controversy, the picture gains a different context; nevertheless, he insisted that he has untainted service in the judiciary, and further denied he was the one advising Mrs. Napoles on legal strategies in connection with the Kevlar helmet cases where she was acquitted by a Division of the Sandiganbayan of which respondent is the Chairman and the then Acting Presiding Justice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>On September 12, 2013, Sula executed a <i>“Karagdagang Sinumpaang Salaysay”</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> wherein she gave details regarding those persons named in her sworn statement, alleged to have visited their office or attended their events, thus:<br><br><blockquote>63) T:&nbsp; Ayon sa paragraph Nos. 32 at 33 ng iyong sinumpaang salaysay na may petsang 29 Agosto 2013, nabanggit mo ang mga personalidad na nakikita mong bumibisita sa inyong opisina o di kaya naman sa tuwing may party o special occacions si JANET NAPOLES ay may mga special guests kayo na kinabibilangan ng mga malalaking pulitiko at ang iba naman ay may mga katungkulan sa gobyerno.&nbsp; Maari mo bang ilahad ang mga pangyayari sa mga bawat pagkakataon na nakita mo sila sa iyong pagkaka-alala?<br><br>S :&nbsp;&nbsp; Opo, iisa-isahin ko po ang mga pangyayari sa mga pagkakataon na nakita ko po ang mga taong nabanggit ko:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>w)&nbsp; Justice GREGORY ONG - <b>Isang beses ko po siyang nakitang nagpunta sa office</b> sa 2501 Discovery Centre, Ortigas at nakita ko po silang <b>magkausap ni Madam JANET NAPOLES sa conference room.</b><br><br>x x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote><br>In her testimony before the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee on September 26, 2013, Sula was asked to confirm her statement regarding Justice Ong, thus:<br><br><blockquote>THE CHAIRMAN.&nbsp; <i>Thank you, Senator Grace.</i><br><i>Isang tanong lang kay</i> Ms. Sula.<br><br><i>Sinabi niyo kanina may tinawagan si Ms. Napoles at sinabi niya, “Malapit na lumabas yung TRO galing sa korte.” <b> May kilala pa ba si Janet Lim Napoles sa huwes sa korte sa Sandiganbayan</b>?</i><br><br>MS.

A. Sereno, respondent meticulously explained the controversial photograph which raised questions on his integrity as a magistrate, particularly in connection with the decision rendered by the Sandiganbayan’s Fourth Division in the Kevlar helmet cases, which convicted some of the accused but acquitted Mrs. Napoles.<br><br>Respondent surmised that the photograph was taken during the birthday of Senator Estrada in February, either in the year 2012 or 2013, but definitely not in 2010 or earlier. He explained that he could vaguely remember the circumstances but it would have been rude for him to prevent any guest from posing with him and Senator Estrada during the party.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the nature of his association with Mrs. Napoles, respondent asserted:<br><br><blockquote>(4) I can categorically state, on the other hand, that <b>I have never attended any party or social event hosted by Mrs. Napoles or her family, either before she had a case with our court, or while she already had a pending case with&nbsp; our court, or at any time afterwards.</b>&nbsp; I have never, to use the term of Mr. Rufo in his article, “partied” with the Napoleses. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>As to the Kevlar helmet cases, respondent said it was impossible for him to have been advising Mrs. Napoles, as claimed by Mr. Rufo, as even the article itself noted that Mrs. Napoles’ own brother,&nbsp; Reynald L. Lim, (a.k.a. Reynaldo L. Francisco), a co-accused in the case, was convicted by the Sandiganbayan.&nbsp;&nbsp; He stressed that these cases were decided on the merits by the Sandiganbayan, acting as a collegial body and he was not even the <i>ponente</i> of the decision.<br><br>Respondent thus submitted himself to the discretion of the Chief Justice such that even without being required to submit an explanation, he voluntarily did so “to defend [his] reputation as a judge and protect the Sandiganbayan as an institution from unfair and malicious innuendos.”<br><br>On October 7, 2013, Chief Justice Sereno wrote the Members of this Court, citing the testimonies of Luy and Sula before the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee “[t]hat the malversation case involving Mrs. Janet Lim-Napoles, Major Jaime G. Napoles, Jenny Lim Napoles, Reynaldo L. Francisco and other perpetrators was ‘fixed’ (<i>inayos</i>) through the intervention of Justice Gregory S. Ong of the Sandiganbayan”, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>SEN. ANGARA.&nbsp; <i>Sa inyo, hindi niyo alam kung inayos iyong kaso na iyon?

Zapata is <b>INFORMED</b> that there is no more need to transmit to this Court the post-sentence investigation reports and other reports on the supervisory history of the accused-probationers in Criminal Case Nos. 26768 and 26769.<br></blockquote><br><center><b><u>Report and Recommendation of the Investigating Justice</u></b><br></center><br>Justice Angelina Sandoval-Gutierrez, a retired Member of this Court, submitted her report with the following findings and conclusions:<br><br><blockquote><center><b>FACTUAL ANTECEDENTS<br>1.&nbsp; THE KEVLAR CASE</b><br></center><br>Two criminal cases were filed with the Sandiganbayan sometime in 2001 – Criminal Case No. 26768 for Falsification of Public Documents and Criminal Case No. 26769 for Violation of Section 3(e) of the Anti-Graft Law.&nbsp; Charged were several members of Philippine Marine Corps and civilian employees including Ms. Janet L. Napoles (Napoles), her mother Magdalena Francisco (now deceased), her brother Reynaldo Francisco and wife Anna Marie Dulguime, and her (Napoles’) three employees.<br><br>These cases are referred to as the Kevlar case because the issue involved is the same – the questionable purchase of 500 Kevlar helmets by the Philippine Marine Corps in the amount of P3,865,310.00 from five suppliers or companies owned by Napoles.<br><br>The prosecution alleged <i>inter alia</i> that the accused, acting in conspiracy, released the payment although there was yet no delivery of the Kevlar helmets; that the suppliers are mere dummies of Napoles; and that the helmets were made in Taiwan, not in the U.S.A.<br><br>Napoles’ husband, Major Jaime Napoles, was dropped from the two Informations in an Order issued by the Ombudsman on March 18, 2002.<br><br>Napoles’ mother, brother, and sister-in-law were among those convicted for the lesser crime of Falsification of Public Documents and sentenced to suffer the penalty of 4 years and 2 months of <i>prision correccional</i> to 8 years and 1 day of <i>prision mayor</i> and each to pay P5,000.00.&nbsp; They all underwent probation.<br><br>Napoles and six members of the Philippine Marine Corps were acquitted in both cases.<br><br>The court ruled that Napoles “was not one of the dealer-payees in the transaction in question.&nbsp; Even if she owns the bank account where the 14 checks were later deposited, this does not in itself translate to her conspiracy in the crimes charged x x x.”<br><br>x x x x<br><br><center><b>THE INVESTIGATION</b><br></center><br>x x x x<br><br><b>I.</b>&nbsp; During the investigation, Benhur testified that he and Napoles are second cousins.&nbsp; After passing the Medical Technology Licensure Examination in 2002, he was employed in the JLN (Janet Lim Napoles) Corporation as Napoles’ personal assistant. As such, he was in charge of disbursements of her personal funds and those of her office.&nbsp; He was also in charge of government transactions of the corporation and kept records of its daily business activities.<br><br>In the course of Benhur’s employment at the JLN Corporation, Napoles mentioned to him the Kevlar case, then pending in the Sandiganbayan, saying she has a “connect” in that court who would help her.<br><br>When asked about his testimony before the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee concerning the Kevlar case, Benhur declared that Napoles’ “connect” with the Sandiganbayan is respondent, thus:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Q </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">The question was, Mr. Witness, this is coming from Senator Angara, and I quote, “Kailan ho lumabas yung decision ng Court sa Kevlar?” And just to refresh your memory, Mr. Witness, then Ms. Sula answered, “I think 2010.

Sige huwag kang matakot Benhur.”<br><br>Benhur Luy: <i>“Alam ko inayos ni Ms. Napoles iyon dahil may connect nga siya sa Sandiganbayan.”</i></blockquote><br>On how Napoles “inayos” or fixed the Kevlar case, Benhur said that he kept a ledger of the Sandiganbayan case wherein he listed all her expenses in the sum of P100 million pesos. He was surprised why she would spend such amount considering that what was involved in the Kevlar case was only P3.8 million.&nbsp; She explained that she gave various amounts to different people during the pendency of the case which lasted up to ten years.&nbsp; And before the decision in the Kevlar case was released, she also gave money to respondent but she did not mention the amount.&nbsp; Thus, she knew she would be acquitted.<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Q </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">You answered Senator Angara this way which we already quoted a while ago, “Alam ko inayos ni Ms. Napoles iyon dahil may connect nga siya sa Sandiganbayan.” You stated that the connect is Justice Ong.

The two other members of the court, Justice Jose R. Hernandez (<i>ponente</i>) and Justice Maria Cristina J. Cornejo, are independent-minded jurists who could not be pressured or influenced by anybody, not even by their peers;<br><br>3.&nbsp; On Benhur’s allegation that respondent received an amount of money from Napoles prior to the promulgation of the decision in the Kevlar case, respondent deplored the fact that Benhur was attempting to tarnish his reputation without any proof.&nbsp; And that it is unthinkable for him to have received money from Napoles considering that her mother, brother, and sister-in-law were convicted;<br><br>4. Respondent admitted he went to Napoles’ office twice, sometime in March 2012, after the decision in the Kevlar case was promulgated in 2010 and narrated what prompted him to do so, thus:<br><br><blockquote>At the birthday party of Senator Jinggoy Estrada on February 17, 2012, Napoles approached him and introduced herself. She engaged him in a casual conversation and thanked him for her acquittal in the Kevlar case. Respondent replied she should thank her “evidence” instead, adding that had the court found enough evidence against her, she would have been convicted.&nbsp; She talked about her charity works like supporting Chinese priests, building churches and chapels in China, and sponsoring Chinese Catholic priests. He was not interested though in what she was saying until she mentioned the name of Msgr. Ramirez, former Parish Priest of Quiapo Church.<br><br>Respondent became interested because he has been a devotee of the Holy Black Nazarene since he was a little boy.&nbsp; Napoles told him that Msgr. Ramirez has with him the robe of the Holy Black Nazarene which has a healing power if one wears it.&nbsp; Then respondent asked if he can have access to the robe so he can be cured of his ailment (prostate cancer) which he keeps only to himself and to the immediate members of his family. Napoles made arrangement with Msgr. Ramirez until respondent was able to drape the robe over his body for about one or two minutes in Quiapo Church.&nbsp; He also received a fragrant ball of cotton which he keeps until now to heal any ailing part of his body.&nbsp; That was a great deal for him.&nbsp; So out of courtesy, he visited Napoles in her office and thanked her.&nbsp; That was his first visit.<br><br>Thereafter, Napoles kept on calling respondent, inviting him to her office, but he kept on declining.&nbsp; Then finally after two weeks, he acceded for she might think he is “<i>walang kwentang tao</i>.” They just engaged in a small talk for about 30 minutes and had coffee.</blockquote>5.&nbsp; Concerning Benhur’s testimony that Napoles paid respondent an advanced interest consisting of eleven (11) checks in the amount of P282,000.00 each and that he issued to her his BDO check of P25.5 million which she deposited in her account, he claimed that “he never issued that check as he did not intend to invest in AFPSLAI.&nbsp; In fact, he does not have any money deposited there. Inasmuch as he did not issue any BDO check, it follows that Napoles could not have given him those eleven (11) checks representing advanced interest.&nbsp; He further explained that he found from the internet that in AFPSLAI, an investor can only make an initial deposit of P30,000.00 every quarter or P120,000.00 per year.&nbsp; The limit or ceiling is P3 million with an interest of 15% or 16% per annum.<br><br>6. The whistle blower’s testimony are conflicting and therefore lack credibility. While Sula testified that Napoles told her that <b>she did not want to approach respondent</b> (should a case involving the pork barrel scam be filed with the Sandiganbayan) <b>because his talent fee is too high,</b> however, both whistle blowers claimed that he is Napoles’ contact in the Sandiganbayan.<br><br>With respect to the Rappler Report, according to respondent, Rufo was insinuating four things:<br><blockquote>1. That there was irregularity in the manner the Kevlar case was decided;<br><br>2. That respondent was close to Napoles even during the pendency of the Kevlar case;<br><br>3. That respondent was attending parties of the Napoleses; and<br><br>4. That respondent was advising Napoles about legal strategies relative to the Kevlar case.</blockquote>Respondent “dismissed all the above insinuations as false and without factual basis.”&nbsp; As to the last insinuation that he advised Napoles about legal strategies to be pursued in the Kevlar case, respondent stressed that the case was decided by a collegial body and that he never interceded on her behalf.<br><br><center><b>EVALUATION</b><br></center><br>x x x x<br><br>It bears stressing that before the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee, Benhur initially testified that Napoles fixed or <i>“inayos</i>” the Kevlar case because she has a contact at the Sandiganbayan, referring to respondent.&nbsp; Sula corroborated Benhur’s testimony.<br><br>Testifying before the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee is certainly an ordeal.&nbsp; The witnesses and everything they say are open to the public.&nbsp; They are subjected to difficult questions propounded by the Senators, supposedly intelligent and knowledgeable of the subject and issues under inquiry.&nbsp; And they can easily detect whether a person under investigation is telling the truth or not. Considering this challenging and difficult setting, it is indubitably improbable that the two whistle blowers would testify falsely against respondent.<br><br>Moreover, during the investigation of this case, Benhur and Sula testified in a candid, straightforward, and categorical manner.&nbsp; Their testimonies were instantaneous, clear, unequivocal, and carried with it the ring of truth.<br><br>In fact, their answers to the undersigned’s probing questions were consistent with their testimonies before the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee.&nbsp; During cross-examination, they did not waver or falter.&nbsp; The undersigned found the two whistle blowers as credible witnesses and their story untainted with bias and contradiction, reflective of honest and trustworthy witnesses.<br><br>The undersigned therefore finds unmeritorious respondent’s claim that Benhur and Sula were lying.<br><br>…respondent insisted he could not have intervened in the disposition of the Kevlar case considering that Napoles’ mother, brother and sister-in-law were convicted.<br><br>Respondent must have forgotten that Napoles’ natural instinct was self-preservation. Hence, she would avail of every possible means to be exonerated. Besides, respondent’s belief that the two members of his Division are independent-minded Jurists remains to be a mere allegation.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>With the undersigned’s finding that there is credence in the testimonies of Benhur and Sula, there is no need to stretch one’s imagination to arrive at the inevitable conclusion that in “fixing” Kevlar case, money could be the consideration... Benhur testified he kept a ledger (already shredded) of expenses amounting to P100 million incurred by Napoles for the Sandiganbayan during the pendency of the Kevlar case which extended up to ten years; and that Napoles told him she gave respondent an undetermined sum of money.<br><br>Respondent maintains that the testimonies of Benhur and Sula are pure hearsay, inadmissible in evidence:<br><br><blockquote>Justice Ong<br><br>Your honor, since these are all accusations against me by Luy and Sula, and according to Luy and Sula, these were only told to them by Napoles, always their statements were…they do not have personal knowledge, it was only told to them by Napoles, is it possible that we subpoena Napoles so that the truth will come out?

They did not present Napoles to rebut the testimonies of Benhur and Sula. Significantly, respondent failed to consider that his testimony is likewise hearsay.&nbsp; He should have presented Msgr. Ramirez and Napoles as witnesses to support his claim regarding their role which enabled him to wear the robe of the Holy Black Nazarene.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Respondent’s acts of allowing himself to be Napoles’ contact in the Sandiganbayan, resulting in the fixing of the Kevlar case, and of accepting money from her, constitute gross misconduct, a violation of the New Code of Judicial Conduct for the Philippine Judiciary.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>That Benhur personally prepared the eleven (11) checks which Napoles handed to respondent led the undersigned to conclude without hesitation that this charge is true.&nbsp; It is highly inconceivable that Benhur could devise or concoct his story.&nbsp; He gave a detailed and lucid narration of the events, concluding that actually Napoles gave respondent P3,102,000.00 as advanced interest.<br><br>According to respondent, the purpose of his first visit was to thank Napoles for making it possible for him to wear the Holy Black Nazarene’s robe.&nbsp; Even assuming it is true, nonetheless it is equally true that during that visit, respondent could have transacted business with Napoles.&nbsp; Why should Napoles pay respondent an advanced interest of P3,102,000.0 with her own money if it were not a consideration for a favor?<br><br>Respondent’s transgression pertains to his personal life and no direct relation to his judicial function. It is not misconduct but plain dishonesty.&nbsp; His act is unquestionably disgraceful and renders him morally unfit as a member of the Judiciary and unworthy of the privileges the law confers on him. Furthermore, respondent’s conduct supports Benhur’s assertion that he received money from Napoles.<br><br>Dishonesty likewise violates Canon 2 (1 and 2) on Integrity of the same Code providing in part that judges must ensure that their conduct is above reproach and must reaffirm the people’s faith in the integrity of the Judiciary.<br><br>Indeed, respondent should not stay in his position even for a moment.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>...From respondent’s end, there was nothing wrong when he visited Napoles twice in her office considering that the visits took place long after the promulgation of the decision in the Kevlar case.<br><br>Contrary to respondent’s submission, such acts also constitute gross misconduct in violation of Canon 4 on Propriety of the same Code.&nbsp; Section 1 provides that judges shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all of their activities.<br><br>…respondent’s reason for his first visit was to thank Napoles for her help in making it possible for him to wear the robe of the Holy Black Nazarene.&nbsp; Instead of visiting her, respondent could have extended his gratitude by simply calling her by phone. Worse, he visited her again because she may think he is an unworthy person. This is an extremely frail reason.&nbsp; He was seen by the whistle blowers and their co-workers who, without doubt, readily confirmed that he was Napoles’ contact at the Sandiganbayan and that he “fixed” the decision in the Kevlar case.<br><br>Respondent cannot be excused for his unconcern for the position he holds. Being aptly perceived as the visible personification of law and justice, his personal behavior, not only while in the performance of official duties but also outside the court, must be beyond reproach.&nbsp; A judicial office circumscribes a personal conduct and imposes a number of inhibitions, whose faithful observance is the price one has to pay for holding an exalted position.<br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br><center>On the photograph showing respondent<br>with Senator Jinggoy Estrada and Napoles.</center><br>x x x x</blockquote>This incident manifests respondent’s disregard of the dictum that propriety and the appearance of propriety are essential to the performance of all the activities of a judge.&nbsp; This exacting standard of decorum is demanded from judges to promote public confidence in the integrity of the Judiciary.<br><br>In joining Senator Estrada and Napoles in a picture taking, respondent gave a ground for reproach by reason of impropriety.&nbsp; It bears reiterating Canon 4 (1) on Propriety of the same Code which provides that judges shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all of their activities.<br><br>Respondent maintained that he did not know Napoles at that time because she was not present before the Sandiganbayan during the hearing of the Kevlar case for she must have waived her appearance.&nbsp; Respondent’s explanation lacks merit. That court could not have acquired jurisdiction over her if she did not appear personally for arraignment.<br><br>Of utmost significance is the fact that this is not the first time that respondent has been charged administratively. In “<i>Assistant Special Prosecutor III Rohermina J. Jamsani-Rodriguez v. Justices Gregory S. Ong, Jose R. Hernandez and Rodolfo A. Ponferrada, Sandiganbayan,</i>” the Supreme Court found respondent Justice Ong guilty of violation of PD 1606 and The Revised Internal Rules of the Sandiganbayan for non-observance of collegiality in hearing criminal cases in the Hall of Justice, Davao City. Instead of siting as a collegial body, the members of the Sandiganbayan Fourth Division adopted a different procedure. The Division was divided into two.

The Sandiganbayan Fourth Division, of which respondent was the Chairman, held that Napoles did not conspire with the suppliers in the questionable purchase of the Kevlar helmets as she was not one of the “dealer-payees” in the transaction in question and that there was no proof of an overt act on her part.&nbsp; How could the Fourth Division arrive at such conclusion?&nbsp; The Decision itself indicates clearly that&nbsp; (1) Napoles was following up the processing of the documents; (2) that she was in charge of the delivery of the helmets; and (3) the checks amounting to P3,864,310.00 as payment for the helmets were deposited and cleared in only one bank account, Security Bank Account No. 512-000-2200, in the name of Napoles.<br><br>Considering this glaring irregularity, it is safe to conclude that indeed respondent has a hand in the acquittal of Napoles.&nbsp; All along, the&nbsp; whistle blowers were telling the truth.<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b><center>RECOMMENDATION<br></center></b><br><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING</b>, It is respectfully recommended, for consideration of the Honorable Court, that respondent Justice Gregory S.

Napoles constantly updated them of developments regarding the case.&nbsp; She revealed to them that she has a&nbsp;&nbsp; “connect” or “contact” in the Sandiganbayan who will help “fix” the case involving her, her mother, brother and some employees.&nbsp; Having closely observed and heard Napoles being confident that she will be acquitted even prior to the promulgation of the decision in the Kevlar case, they were convinced she was indeed in contact with respondent, whose identity was earlier divulged by Napoles to Luy.&nbsp; Luy categorically testified that Napoles told him she gave money to respondent but did not disclose the amount.&nbsp; There was no reason for them to doubt Napoles’ statement as they even keep a ledger detailing her expenses for the “Sandiganbayan,” which reached P100 million. Napoles’ information about her association with respondent was confirmed when she was eventually acquitted in 2010 and when they saw respondent visit her office and given the eleven checks issued by Napoles in 2012.<br><br>Respondent maintains that the testimonies of Luy and Sula were hearsay as they have no personal knowledge of the matters they were testifying, which were merely told to them by Napoles.&nbsp; Specifically, he points to portions of Sula’s testimony indicating that Napoles had not just one but “contact persons” in Ombudsman and Sandiganbayan; hence, it could have been other individuals, not him, who could help Napoles “fix” the Kevlar case, especially since Napoles never really disclosed to Sula who was her (Napoles) contact at the Sandiganbayan and at one of their conversations Napoles even supposedly said that respondent’s “talent fee” was too high.<br><br>Bribery is committed when a public officer agrees to perform an act in connection with the performance of official duties in consideration of any offer, promise, gift or present received.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; A judge who extorts money from a party-litigant who has a case before the court commits a serious misconduct and this Court has condemned such act in the strongest possible terms.&nbsp; Particularly because it has been committed by one charged with the responsibility of administering the law and rendering justice, it quickly and surely corrodes respect for law and the courts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>An accusation of bribery is easy to concoct and difficult to disprove. The complainant must present a panoply of evidence in support of such an accusation. Inasmuch as what is imputed against the respondent judge connotes a grave misconduct, the quantum of proof required should be more than substantial.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; Concededly, the evidence in this case is insufficient to sustain the bribery and corruption charges against the respondent. Both Luy and Sula have not witnessed respondent actually receiving money from Napoles in exchange for her acquittal in the Kevlar case.&nbsp; Napoles had confided to Luy her alleged bribe to respondent.<br><br>Notwithstanding the absence of direct evidence of any corrupt act by the respondent, we find credible evidence of his association with Napoles after the promulgation of the decision in the Kevlar case. The totality of the circumstances of such association strongly indicates respondent’s corrupt inclinations that only heightened the public’s perception of anomaly in the decision-making process.&nbsp; By his act of going to respondent at her office on two occasions, respondent exposed himself to the suspicion that he was partial to Napoles.&nbsp; That respondent was not the ponente of the decision which was rendered by a collegial body did not forestall such suspicion of partiality, as evident from the public disgust generated by the publication of a photograph of respondent together with Napoles and Senator Jinggoy Estrada. Indeed, the context of the declarations under oath by Luy and Sula before the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee, taking place at the height of the “Pork Barrel” controversy, made all the difference as respondent himself acknowledged.&nbsp; Thus, even in the present administrative proceeding, their declarations are taken in the light of the public revelations of what they know of that government corruption controversy, and how it has tainted the image of the Judiciary.<br><br>The hearsay testimonies of Luy and Sula generated intense public interest because of their close relationship to Napoles and their crucial participation in her transactions with government officials, dubbed by media as the “Pork Barrel Queen.”&nbsp; But as aptly observed by Justice Sandoval-Gutierrez, the “challenging and difficult setting” of the Senate hearings where they first testified, made it highly improbable that these whistle blowers would testify against the respondent.&nbsp;&nbsp; During the investigation of this case, Justice Sandoval-Gutierrez described their manner of testifying as “candid, straightforward and categorical.” She likewise found their testimonies as “instantaneous, clear, unequivocal, and carried with it the ring of truth,” and more important, these are consistent with their previous testimonies before the Senate; they never wavered or faltered even during cross-examination.<br><br>It is a settled rule that the findings of investigating magistrates are generally given great weight by the Court by reason of their unmatched opportunity to see the deportment of the witnesses as they testified.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; The rule which concedes due respect, and even finality, to the assessment of credibility of witnesses by trial judges in civil and criminal cases applies a<i> fortiori </i>to administrative cases.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; In particular, we concur with Justice Sandoval-Gutierrez’s assessment on the credibility of Luy and Sula, and disagree with respondent’s claim that these witnesses are simply telling lies about his association with Napoles.<br><br>Contrary to respondent’s submission, Sula in her testimony said that whenever Napoles talked about her contacts in the Ombudsman and Sandiganbayan, they knew that insofar as the Sandiganbayan was concerned, it was understood that she was referring to respondent even as she may have initially contacted some persons to get to respondent, and also because they have seen him meeting with Napoles at her office. It appears that Napoles made statements regarding the Kevlar case not just to Luy but also to the other employees of JLN Corporation.&nbsp; The following are excerpts from Sula’s testimony on direct examination, where she even hinted at their expected outcome of the Kevlar case:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan="2">Atty.

Judges shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all of their activities.</blockquote><br>A judge must not only be impartial but must also appear to be impartial and that fraternizing with litigants tarnishes this appearance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Public confidence in the Judiciary is eroded by irresponsible or improper conduct of judges.

He must conduct himself in a manner that gives no ground for reproach.”</b> (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote></blockquote><br>On this score, our previous pronouncements have enjoined judges to avoid association or socializing with persons who have pending cases before their court.&nbsp; Respondent cites the case of <i>Abundo v. Manio, Jr.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> where this Court did not find fault with a judge who was charged with fraternizing with his lawyer-friend.&nbsp; In that case, we said:<br><br><blockquote>Respondent admits that he and Atty. Pajarillo became close friends in 1989 when they were both RTC judges stationed in Naga City. Since they both resided in Camarines Norte, Atty. Pajarillo hitched rides with respondent to Daet, Camarines Norte in the latter’s car.<br><br>In his Comment, respondent claims that he leaves the door to his chambers open to lawyers or parties with official court business, whose requests and complaints regarding their cases he listens to in full view of his staff, who are witnesses to his transparency and honesty in conducting such dialogues. He also admits that Atty. Pajarillo has been to his house on several occasions, but only to make emergency long-distance calls to his children in Metro Manila. He, however, denies that he and Atty. Pajarillo were frequently seen eating and drinking together in public places.<br><br>We agree with Justice Buzon’s finding that the evidence against respondent on this point was insufficient, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>“On the other hand, the admission of respondent that he attended two public functions where Atty. Pajarillo was also present; that Atty. Pajarillo had been in his house twice or thrice and used his telephone; and that he receives lawyers, including Atty. Pajarillo, and litigants inside his chambers, the door to which is always open so that [the] staff could see that no under the table transactions are taking place, is not proof that he is fraternizing with Atty. Pajarillo. <i>A judge need not ignore a former colleague and friend whenever they meet each other or when the latter makes requests which are not in any manner connected with cases pending in his court.</i> Thus, Canon 30 of the Canons of Judicial Ethics provides:<br><br>‘30.<i> Social relations</i><br><br>It is not necessary to the proper performance of judicial duty that judges should live in retirement or seclusion; it is desirable that, so far as the reasonable attention to the completion of their work will permit, they continue to mingle in social intercourse, and that they should not discontinue their interests in or appearance at meetings of members at the bar. <i>A judge should, however, in pending or prospective litigation before him be scrupulously careful to avoid such action as may reasonably tend to waken the suspicion that his social or business relations or friendships constitute an element in determining his judicial course.</i>’”</blockquote></blockquote><br>The factual setting in <i>Abundo v. Manio, Jr.</i> is not similar to the present case because Napoles was not a colleague or lawyer-friend but an accused in a former case before the Sandiganbayan’s Fourth Division chaired by respondent and which acquitted her from malversation charge.&nbsp; What respondent perhaps want to underscore is the caveat for judges, in pending or prospective litigation before them, to avoid such action as may raise suspicion on their partiality in resolving or deciding the case.&nbsp; Thus, he emphasized in his Memorandum that he “never knew Napoles on a personal level while she was still on trial as an accused in Kevlar helmet case.”&nbsp; Respondent even quoted Sula’s testimony expressing her opinion that she finds nothing wrong with respondent going to Napoles’ office because at that time, the Kevlar case had already been terminated.<br><br>We do not share the view that the rule on propriety was intended to cover only pending and prospective litigations.<br><br>Judges must, at all times, be beyond reproach and should avoid even the mere suggestion of partiality and impropriety.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; Canon 4 of the <u>New Code of Judicial Conduct</u> states that “[p]ropriety and the appearance of propriety are essential to the performance of <i>all</i> the activities of a judge.”&nbsp; Section 2 further provides:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 2. As a subject of constant public scrutiny, judges must accept personal restrictions that might be viewed as burdensome by the ordinary citizen and should do so freely and willingly. In particular, judges shall conduct themselves in a way&nbsp; that is consistent with the dignity of the judicial office.</blockquote><br>As we held in <i>Sibayan-Joaquin v. Javellana</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br><blockquote>…Judges, indeed, should be extra prudent in associating with litigants and counsel appearing before them so as to avoid even a mere perception of possible bias or partiality. It is not expected, of course, that judges should live in retirement or seclusion from any social intercourse. Indeed, it may be desirable, for instance, that they continue, time and work commitments permitting, to relate to members of the bar in worthwhile endeavors and in such fields of interest, in general, as are in keeping with the noble aims and objectives of the legal profession. In pending or prospective litigations before them, however, judges should be scrupulously careful to avoid anything that may tend to awaken the suspicion that their personal, social or sundry relations could influence their objectivity, for not only must judges possess proficiency in law but that also they must act and behave in such manner that would assure, with great comfort, litigants and their counsel of the judges’ competence, integrity and independence.</blockquote><br>In this light, it does not matter that the case is no longer pending when improper acts were committed by the judge. Because magistrates are under constant public scrutiny, the termination of a case will not deter public criticisms for acts which may cast suspicion on its disposition or resolution.&nbsp; As what transpired in this case, respondent’s association with Napoles has unfortunately dragged the Judiciary into the “Pork Barrel” controversy which initially involved only legislative and executive officials.&nbsp;&nbsp; Worse, Napoles’ much-flaunted “contact” in the judiciary is no less than a Justice of the Sandiganbayan, our special court tasked with hearing graft cases. We cannot, by any stretch of indulgence and compassion, consider respondent’s transgression as a simple misconduct.<br><br>During his testimony, respondent acknowledged his violation of judicial ethics and its serious repercussions, as shown by his answers to the questions from the Investigation Justice, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">Justice Gutierrez</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><br></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">What I am thinking Justice, as a Justice holding a very high position, could it not be possible for you to just go to the Church of Quiapo and ask the priest there to help you or assist you, no longer through Ms. Napoles?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">Justice Ong</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><br></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">You cannot do that, your honor.

On the other hand,&nbsp; Luy’s testimony on what transpired in one of respondent’s meeting with Napoles at her office&nbsp; appears to be the more plausible and truthful version.&nbsp;&nbsp; Expectedly, respondent denied having issued a BDO check for P25.5 million as claimed by Luy, and asserted he (respondent) did not deposit any money to AFPSLAI.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Luy is unable to present documentary evidence saying that, as previously testified by him before the Senate, most of the documents in their office were shredded upon orders of Napoles when the “Pork Barrel Scam” controversy came out.<br><br>Justice Sandoval-Gutierrez stated that the eleven checks of P282,000.00 supposed advance interest for respondent’s check deposit to AFPSLAI were given to respondent as consideration for the favorable ruling in the Kevlar case.&nbsp; Such finding is consistent with Luy’s testimony that Napoles spent a staggering P100 million just to “fix” the said case.&nbsp; Under the circumstances, it is difficult to believe that respondent went to Napoles office the second time just to have coffee.&nbsp; Respondent’s act of again visiting Napoles at her office, after he had supposedly merely thanked her during the first visit, tends to support Luy’s claim that respondent had a financial deal with Napoles regarding advance interest for AFPSLAI deposit.&nbsp; The question inevitably arises as to why would Napoles extend such an accommodation to respondent if not as consideration for her acquittal in the Kevlar case?&nbsp;&nbsp; Respondent’s controversial photograph alone had raised adverse public opinion, with the media speculating on pay-offs taking place in the courts.<br><br>Regrettably, the conduct of respondent gave cause for the public in general to doubt the honesty and fairness of his participation in the Kevlar case and the integrity of our courts of justice. Before this Court, even prior to the commencement of administrative investigation, respondent was less than candid.&nbsp; In his letter to the Chief Justice where he vehemently denied having attended parties or social events hosted by Napoles, he failed to mention that he had in fact visited Napoles at her office.&nbsp; Far from being a plain omission, we find that respondent deliberately did not disclose his social calls to Napoles.&nbsp; It was only when Luy and Sula testified before the Senate and named him as the “contact” of Napoles in the Sandiganbayan, that respondent mentioned of only one instance he visited Napoles (“<i>This is the single occasion that Sula was talking about in&nbsp; her supplemental affidavit x x x”</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>).<br><br>The Court finds that respondent, in not being truthful on crucial matters even before the administrative complaint was filed against him <i>motu proprio</i>, is guilty of Dishonesty, a violation of Canon 3 (Integrity) of the <u>New Code of Judicial Conduct</u>.<br><br>Dishonesty is a “disposition to lie, cheat, deceive, or defraud; untrustworthiness; lack of integrity; lack of honesty, probity or integrity in principle; lack of fairness and straightforwardness; disposition to defraud, deceive or betray.” <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Dishonesty, being a grave offense, carries the extreme penalty of dismissal from the service with forfeiture of retirement benefits except accrued leave credits, and with perpetual disqualification from re-employment in government service.

Villarama, Jr.’s conclusion that the respondent Justice Gregory Ong (<i>Justice Ong</i>), Chairman of the Fourth Division of the Sandiganbayan, should be dismissed from the service for <b><u>gross misconduct, dishonesty and impropriety.</u></b><br><br>I likewise submit this Opinion to express my disagreement with the opinions of Associate Justices Lucas P. Bersamin, Jose P. Perez and Bienvenido L. Reyes that Justice Ong should only be penalized for simple misconduct and meted the lighter penalty of three to six months suspension.<br><br>I take this opportunity, too, to draw the Court’s attention to the administrative offense of gross misconduct where the underlying act involved is bribery.&nbsp; If the Court is serious about its anti-corruption intentions, it is high time that it makes itself clear on the needed quantum of evidence to support a finding of administrative liability, in contrast with the quantum of evidence needed to find a public officer guilty of bribery in a criminal proceeding.<br><br>An administrative offense, as has been established,&nbsp; should be proven by substantial evidence as it involves an administrative proceeding; a criminal case, on the other hand, necessarily requires proof beyond reasonable doubt.&nbsp; Furthermore, we should clarify in the strongest terms that no need exists to apply in an administrative proceeding an amorphous quantum of evidence higher than substantial evidence – in the manner a Member of this Court advocates.<br><br>I likewise posit that the present case should serve as a wake-up call for us to re-examine the use of hearsay evidence in disciplinary proceedings, when the serious charge of bribery (or gross misconduct based on bribery) is involved.&nbsp; We have disallowed the use of hearsay evidence in the past.&nbsp; Should we continue with this rule?<br><br>Bribery, like rape, is a transgression that is almost never committed in public view.&nbsp; It thrives and prospers in the dark, in secrecy.&nbsp; But this illegality is not totally unknown to the Members of this Court; we all know that bribery is happening in our midst.&nbsp; The media hints at it; law practitioners talk about it and do not even do so in whispers; clients accept it as a fact of litigation and readily accept their counsels’ claim for extra expenses “<i>para kay justice, para kay judge o para kay fiscal</i>” – a grave injustice to many in the judiciary and the prosecution service who have strictly trodden the high road of morality in the public service.<br><br>In one recent administrative matter, we even asked a leading and high profile law practitioner to explain the claim she made in a leading radio station that bribery exists in the High Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; She blithely escaped sanction by claiming that she only “heard” about the bribery she spoke about, but at the same time hinted that she could not speak about this charge because she has cases before this Court.<br><br>Thus, as a practical reality, this Court is now in a public denial mode about bribery and does so by maintaining the rule that disallows hearsay evidence in disciplinary proceedings, even if the hearsay testimony is already confirmed by the totality of the evidence on record.<br><br>Additionally, we should admit that judges, based on their knowledge, training and experience, should be adept at recognizing, proving (and consequently evading) the administrative offense of bribery. This reality should make us aware (if, for some reason, we have not yet reached this level of cognition) that we would effectively be condoning the presence of the offenders among us if from the very start we adopt the rule that we should not consider hearsay evidence at all.&nbsp; In this sense, all of us – the Members of this Court – may ourselves be worthy of blame for the proliferation of corruption in the judiciary.<br><br><b><i>The better approach, I believe, is to allow the investigating judges and justices sufficient discretion to admit hearsay evidence, subject to guidelines in determining its probative value</i></b>.&nbsp; (I dwell at length on this point in the discussions below.)<br><br>This approach, in my view, gives the Court flexibility in disciplining its ranks without sacrificing both the fairness that should be accorded the respondent judges, judicial officials and employees, and the character of reliability that evidence must carry to support a finding of administrative liability.<br><br><b><i>I. Antecedents</i></b><br><br>The present administrative case against Justice Ong sprang from various testimonies given by whistleblowers Benhur Luy (<i>Luy</i>) and Marina Sula (<i>Sula</i>) at the height of the pork barrel scam scandal.<br><br>Both Luy and Sula had been employees of Janet Lim-Napoles (<i>Napoles</i>), the main personality involved in the high profile scandal, more popularly known as the pork barrel scam.&nbsp; Both claimed to have helped facilitate Napoles’ nefarious schemes.&nbsp; In the course of offering their testimonies against Napoles, they claimed that Justice Ong was Napoles’ “<b><i>contact man</i></b>” at the Sandiganbayan – the country’s anti-graft court.<br><br>In a sworn statement filed before the National Bureau of Investigation (<i>NBI</i>), Sula narrated that Napoles urged her not to testify against her, and promised that she would help Sula once she is able to clear her name.&nbsp; Sula also named Justice Ong to be among those who had visited Napoles’ office.<br><br>The day following the execution of Sula’s sworn statement, Aries Rufo of the news network Rappler, published the article entitled “<b><i>Exclusive: Napoles parties with Anti-graft Court Justice.”</i></b> The article showed the photograph of Senator Jinggoy Estrada (<i>Senator Estrada</i>, one of the main public figures now criminally charged in the pork barrel scam scandal) together with Napoles and Justice Ong.&nbsp; The article also noted that Justice Ong had been a member of the Sandiganbayan’s Fourth Division that handled the Kevlar Helmet case where Napoles stood accused for the ghost purchase of 500 Kevlar helmets in 1998; the Fourth Division that Justice Ong chairs acquitted Napoles of the criminal charge.<br><br>Thereafter, the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee held committee hearings to investigate the pork barrel scam.&nbsp; At these hearings, Sula reiterated her statements about Justice Ong.<br><br>It was at this time that Justice Ong, unbidden, wrote Chief Justice Maria Lourdes P. A. Sereno (<i>Chief Justice Sereno</i>) a letter explaining the photo published in Rappler.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Court responded to the letter, the Rappler article, and Sula’s testimony before the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee, by initiating a <i>motu proprio</i> investigation of Justice Ong.<br><br>The Court designated former Justice Angelina Sandoval-Gutierrez, a retired Member of this Court, as the investigating justice tasked to investigate Justice Ong’s involvement with Napoles.<br><br>After hearing the testimonies of Sula, Luy and Justice Ong and considering their submitted Memoranda, Justice Sandoval-Gutierrez recommended in her Report to the Court that Justice Ong be found liable for gross misconduct, dishonesty and impropriety.&nbsp; She recommended that Justice Ong be dismissed from service, with forfeiture of all retirement benefits and with prejudice to re-employment in any government agency or instrumentality.<br><br>Justice Villarama affirmed Justice Sandoval-Gutierrez’s Report, holding that:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="CENTER">(1)</div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Justice Ong is guilty of gross misconduct and impropriety, for violating <b>Canon 1 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct</b>, which requires judges to avoid acts and the appearance of impropriety in all their activities. The totality of the circumstances shows that Justice Ong associated with Napoles after the promulgation of the decision in the Kevlar Helmet case. To Justice Villarama, these circumstances strongly indicate Justice Ong’s corrupt inclinations and heightened the public’s perception of anomaly in the Judiciary’s decision-making process.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>Justice Villarama arrived at his conclusion by giving credit to the testimonies of Sula and Luy who both identified Justice Ong as Napoles’ contact man at the Sandiganbayan.&nbsp; This finding is supported by the photographs showing him with Senator Estrada and Napoles at a party.&nbsp; Taken together, these pieces of evidence sufficiently proved that he had <b><u><i>exposed himself to suspicion</i></u></b> of partiality to Napoles.<br><br>Justice Villarama also noted that the financial accommodation that Napoles gave Justice Ong – which Luy testified to – could be the financial consideration for Justice Ong’s assistance in Napoles’ acquittal in the Kevlar Helmet case.&nbsp; The acquittal and Luy’s testimony gave the public cause to doubt the honesty and fairness of Justice Ong’s participation in the Kevlar Helmet&nbsp; case and the integrity of our justice system.<br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="CENTER">(2)</div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY"> Justice Ong committed dishonesty and violated <b><u>Canon 3 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct on Integrity</u></b>. In his letter to Chief Justice Sereno, he denied attending parties hosted by Napoles, and omitted to inform her that he had visited Napoles’ office twice. It was only when Luy and Sula testified before the Senate and named him as the “contact man” of Napoles in the Sandiganbayan, that Justice Ong admitted that he had visited Napoles at her office once.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><br>Justices Bersamin, Perez and Reyes argue on this point that the core of Luy and Sala’s testimonies cannot be used to conclude that Justice Ong committed the offenses charged, as the testimonies of these witnesses are hearsay.&nbsp; According to them, Luy and Sula do not have personal knowledge of the alleged financial transaction between Napoles and Justice Ong.&nbsp; Neither should Justice Ong be held accountable for dishonesty because Justice Villarama took out of context Justice Ong’s statement that he visited Napoles only once. To the three magistrates, Justice Ong should thus be only found liable for <b><i><u>simple misconduct</u></i></b> for mingling with litigants before his court, which offense is punishable by suspension and a fine.<br><br><b>With due respect to my esteemed Colleagues, I believe that they failed to consider that Justice Ong’s admitted “mingling” with Napoles came while the probation case of Napoles’ co-accused in the Kevlar Helmet case was still pending at the Sandiganbayan’s Fourth Division.&nbsp; These co-accused are all her close relatives – her mother Magdalena L. Francisco, her brother, Reynaldo L. Franscico and her sister-in-law Ana Marie Dulguime. My Colleagues apparently failed to consider that these co-accused/relatives, despite their conviction, never went to jail; when matters had sufficiently quieted down, Justice Ong granted them probation and even penned the ruling on reconsideration.<br><br><i><blockquote>II.&nbsp;&nbsp; The nature of disciplinary proceedings of judges should allow us to admit hearsay evidence in appropriate cases</blockquote></i></b><br>In evaluating the pieces of evidence relating to the charge of bribery against Justice Ong, Justice Reyes posits that a standard of evidence, <i>higher than substantial evidence</i>, should be used to arrive at the conclusion that Justice Ong had indeed been bribed by Napoles.&nbsp; Several Colleagues in the Court additionally argue that hearsay evidence against Justice Ong should not be admitted nor given probative value, and that, in any case, the remaining pieces of evidence are insufficient to prove the bribery charge.<br><br>Disciplinary proceedings against members of the bench have been characterized as administrative proceedings,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> as the end result of these proceedings involves the determination of whether the respondent judge committed an administrative offense that carries a disciplinary penalty. The penalties range from the lightest penalty of admonition with warning, to the ultimate penalty of dismissal from the service.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>I submit that the characterization of disciplinary proceedings against members and officials of the judiciary as a mere administrative proceeding whose aim is the imposition of penalties, is a very simplistic view of what disciplinary proceedings are.&nbsp; Properly and critically viewed, they are closer to the <i>sui generis </i>nature of disbarment proceedings against lawyers, where the main objective of inquiry is not the infliction of punishment, but the investigation of <b><u>whether the respondent lawyer continues to possess the qualities required of members of the legal profession</u></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Lawyers assume a unique role in our society because they are officers of the court who directly participate in the administration of justice; judges’ and justices’ roles are no less and in fact are higher than those of lawyers as they directly act as the main principals in the administration of justice. Judges and justices directly interpret the law and determine how the scales of justice shall swing through the adjudicatory duties solely reserved for them by the Constitution.<br><br>Under these roles, the all-important question to be answered is <b><u>whether judges and justices are worthy of donning the judicial robes and of discharging the adjudicatory duties of a member of the bench</u></b>.&nbsp; When they err morally and legally in discharging their duties, they become pejoratively known as “hoodlums in robes” and thereby bring disrepute, not only to themselves, but to the institution they represent.<br><br>That disbarment of lawyers should be the take-off point in characterizing and calibrating the role of judges and justices cannot be avoided when it is considered that:<br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="CENTER">(1) </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">The exercise of the legal professions and the higher calling of acting as a magistrate are both considered a privilege;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">(2)</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Both professions are under the regulation and supervision of the Supreme Court;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">(3) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Both professions have crucial roles in the administration of justice – the lawyer as an officer of the court, while the judge is the embodiment of the court that directly acts in dispensing justice;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">(4)</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Both proceedings involve investigating officers appointed by the Supreme Court to inquire on the accusations against the respondent lawyer or judge, to be initiated <i>motu proprio</i> or upon the filing of a complaint;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">(5) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">The ultimate penalty in both disciplinary proceedings involves divesting the respondent lawyer or judge of the privilege to practice law or adjudicate as a member of the judiciary, respectively.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><br>Our focus in disciplinary proceedings for members of the judiciary must necessarily and unavoidably be the determination of whether the respondent judge is still fit for the judicial office, with the preservation of the public interest in an independent, incorruptible judiciary as the ultimate objective.<br><br>In this consideration, the Court calls upon the member of the bench charged with misfeasance or malfeasance, to account for accusations against him or her, with the end in view of keeping the proper and honest administration of justice untainted and immaculate in the public’s view, by excluding from the judiciary those who, by their misconduct, have proven themselves unworthy to be entrusted with the duties and responsibilities of a judge.<br><br>Based on these objectives, the tighter and stricter procedural rules applicable to criminal proceedings, particularly the requirement for a quantum of evidence higher than substantial evidence, cannot and should not be used in disciplinary proceedings involving judges.&nbsp; By their higher evidentiary requirement, proof of wrongdoing becomes more difficult to achieve, ultimately defeating the objectives of disciplinary proceedings.<br><br>As the Court very well knows, our ruling in disciplinary proceedings will not result in the criminal conviction and the incarceration of the respondent judge or justice; our judgment is confined to the finding and declaration of the respondent Justice’s unworthiness to be a member of the judiciary.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>&nbsp; If imprisonment and criminal penalties will result at all from the judge’s or justice’s illegal acts, they will not arise from the disciplinary proceedings; they will arise from separate criminal proceedings that require a whole new and separate process of charges, trial and conviction upon proof beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>Viewed from the perspectives of proportionality, higher evidentiary standards are properly required as stakes become higher in the spectrum of individual rights and liberties; proof beyond reasonable doubt is required in criminal proceedings as the life, liberty and property of the accused are at stake.<br><br>Conversely, as the stakes become lower (as when only the privilege to practice law or to act as judge or justice is involved) it is but proper that evidentiary standards should likewise be lower.&nbsp; To lose this proportion is to lay down a policy vastly in favor of the individual, but at the expense of the societal value of a judiciary whose integrity, fairness and independence must be at their highest.<br><br>In my view, these distinctions ought to be ever present in the Court’s mind in order not to defeat the purpose for which disciplinary proceedings are instituted; forgetting them and setting impossibly high and impractical standards amount to giving up the first line of defense in preserving and maintaining the judiciary’s independence and integrity.<br><br>In the context of the present case, I cannot but emphasize that the gauge for determining whether bribery (or gross misconduct based on bribery) had occurred should be confined to substantial evidence and not to any higher level of evidence.&nbsp; The bribery accusation should be adjudged in the same manner that other accusations of gross misconduct, dishonesty and impropriety should be weighed – through substantial evidence or such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br><b><i>B.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rules on hearsay should be relaxed in disciplinary proceedings against members of the judiciary</i></b><br><br>I likewise cannot accept the strict application of the hearsay rules in the present case as some of my Colleagues advocate.&nbsp; Given the nature of disciplinary proceedings and the indisputable circumstances present in bribery transactions, the demand for evidence executed by one who has strict personal knowledge of the illegal transaction is to ask for a near impossibility in many cases.&nbsp; It is for this reason perhaps that disciplinary findings of bribery or gross misconduct based on bribery come few and far between.<br><br>Indeed, as some of my Colleagues in the Court have pointed out, a bribery charge is easy to concoct.&nbsp; However, it should likewise not be lost to us that a bribery charge, by its very nature, is also very difficult to prove even in an administrative proceeding, more so under the view of some of our Colleagues that a higher burden of proof should be required for a finding that bribery or acts indicating bribery indeed happened.<br><br>Bribery at the consummated stage, by its nature, requires a bribe-giver and a bribe-taker where both participants are parties to the crime.&nbsp; The public official who accepts money or other valuable consideration commits bribery, among other things,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> while the person who offers and gives the bribe is guilty of corruption of a public official.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Necessarily, the persons who have personal knowledge of the transaction would, more often than not, be limited to the offenders themselves who both risk prosecution for their misdeeds.&nbsp; Demanding as a matter of law that witnesses speak from their strict personal knowledge of the actual details of a bribery, would, under these circumstances, practically amount to the requirement that one of the participants turn on the other.&nbsp; Obviously, this requirement would make it extremely difficult to successfully prosecute the crime of bribery.&nbsp; Under these terms, bribery becomes a high percentage crime for the chances of success it offers.<br><br>Consider, too, that bribery cases become even more difficult to prove and establish when one of its participants has extensive knowledge of how bribery is committed and proven in court.&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Bribery is a crime that lawyers study from their first year in law school; its elements as well as the degree of proof required to convict are all drilled into lawyers’ minds from the first course in Criminal Law and later in Remedial Law.</i></b>&nbsp; This knowledge is honed as the lawyer takes the bar examination and as he or she goes into practice.<br><br>The specialized knowledge rises to the <b><u>level of expertise</u></b> when the lawyer enters the judiciary where criminal cases – bribery among them – are the daily fare of the cases he or she handles. This is particularly true for the Sandiganbayan, our anti-graft court, whose expertise and specialty are crimes committed by public officers in the course of their duties, bribery among them.<br><br>I say all these with no intent to cast any pejorative aspersions on the members of the Sandiganbayan.&nbsp; I say these merely as a matter of fact - <b><i>we have before us a respondent who had been schooled and trained on the elements of bribery, and necessarily, for those inclined to commit this crime, on the ways and means to avoid even the mere suspicion of bribery.</i></b>&nbsp; (Note, for example, Luy’s testimony that Justice Ong did not want checks paid out in his name; he wanted these paid “to cash.” Note, too, the claim that he had merely been engaged in an investment transaction, albeit at very high interest rates. Without more and standing alone and by themselves, these ready excuses may possibly pass muster, but not when the other circumstances, discussed below, are considered.)<br><br>Given the nature of disciplinary proceedings for judges, as well as the nature of bribery transactions, I urge my Colleagues in the Court to reconsider and re-examine the need for applying the rules on hearsay evidence in disciplinary proceedings where a bribery allegation is involved.<br><br><b><i>In special situations such as this case, where the illegal transaction is cloaked in secrecy and the dramatis personae include an expert on the intricacies of bribery (particularly on how a charge is prosecuted and evaded), do we not owe the institution we serve and the Filipino people who rely on us for a fair and speedy system of justice, the duty to exhaust all fair and reasonable means necessary to determine if indeed there are corrupt officials within our ranks?</i></b><br><br>I submit that we cannot choose to ignore the special circumstances before us – particularly the confluence of facts before us that can be likened to a smoking gun staring us in the face – simply because an unsound evidentiary technicality tells us to do so.&nbsp; The proper approach, in my view, in order to be sensitive to all the interests involved in an administration of justice situation, is as I expressed in my Concurring Opinion in AM No. 13 – 11 – 09 – SC (<i>Re: Interview with Lorna Kapunan on Corruption in the Judiciary</i>):<br><br><blockquote>I believe and propose to the Court that it desist from declaring the matter in caption closed and terminated simply because the statements Atty. Lorna Kapunan turned out to be hearsay.&nbsp; Instead, the Court should <i><b>proactively</b></i> react to the <b><i>smoke</i></b> that Atty. Kapunan has raised; a <b><i>fire </i></b>must exist somewhere behind her statements.&nbsp; Even smoking embers, if left unattended to, may turn into a raging conflagration. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote><br><b><i>1) The purpose of hearsay evidence and its decline in administrative proceedings in other jurisdictions.</i></b><br><br>Hearsay evidence, or evidence presented by a witness who has no personal knowledge of the fact being attested to – as a rule – is inadmissible as evidence<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> and, even if admitted, offers no probative value.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The exclusion of hearsay evidence has been traditionally justified by the perceived unreliability of out-of-court statements.&nbsp; Traditionally, hearsay evidence poses four risks of unreliability: a <b><i>narration</i> risk</b> (i.e., the risk that the declarant did not mean what he or she seemed to say); a <b><i>sincerity</i> risk</b> (the risk that the declarant intentionally fabricated); a <b><i>memory</i> risk</b> (the risk that the declarant misrecalled what happened); and a <b><i>perception</i> risk</b> (the risk that the declarant misperceived things to begin with).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>While the recognition of these risks admittedly has empirical basis, I believe it equally undeniable that <b><i>we encounter the same risks</i></b> whenever we receive testimony <b><i>from a person who has personal knowledge of the fact or the event sought to be proved</i></b>.<br><br>Indeed, both narrations – one made by a person outside of court (i.e., by a declarant) and another made by a person testifying before the court (i.e., by a witness) may be unreliable.&nbsp; The latter, however, is admitted as evidence before the court because the trial process subjects it to three safeguards that in the end, makes the information the witness recounted more credible: <b><i>first</i></b>, the oath the witness takes to tell the truth, <b><i>second</i></b>, the jury's ability to watch the witness's demeanor, and <b><i>third</i></b>, the opportunity for cross-examination.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Consider, however, that we admit other sources of evidence that may be unreliable and misleading even when subjected to the three safeguards of the trial process, such as the testimony of cooperating co-defendants.&nbsp; In this situation, we admit the testimony but evaluate its credibility and probative value<i> vis a vis</i> other pieces of evidence and the totality of the circumstances that the evidence points us to.<br><br>Legal history tells us that the exclusion of hearsay evidence first emerged as a rule after the introduction of the trial by jury system.&nbsp; Notable scholars observed that judges began excluding hearsay evidence because untrained and inexperienced jurors tended to overvalue such evidence, and failed to fully appreciate the potential sources of weakness in testimonial evidence untested by cross-examination.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Aware of this hearsay rule rationale and its history, administrative agencies in the United States do not exclude hearsay evidence in their quasi-judicial proceedings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> They have recognized that no reason exists to exclude hearsay evidence when hearing <b><i>officers are equipped with training and experience</i></b> to gauge the reliability, value and relevance of the evidence presented before them.&nbsp; (Interestingly in many cases, the admission of hearsay evidence is made even if the administrative proceedings do not necessarily require cross-examination of witnesses.)&nbsp; As in the U.S., and for the same reasons, England likewise eventually allowed the admission of hearsay evidence in civil actions,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> after it slowly departed from civil juries beginning in 1854.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>In the Philippines, we never had the jury system so that the actual and practical reason for the exclusion of hearsay testimony was, for the most part, lost to us.&nbsp; Our heads, however, need not forever be buried in the sands of inherited rules as our system of justice has come of age and has gathered enough experience for a re-examination of the rules that work or do not work for us.<br><br>To be sure, I do not recommend an outright abandonment of our rule on hearsay, but I submit that it is high time that <b><i><u>we re-examine its strict application in administrative proceedings, particularly in disciplinary proceedings of judges and justices where bribery charges are involved.</u></i></b><br><br>Three reasons compel me to make this proposal:<br><br><b><i>First</i></b>, disciplinary proceedings of judges, as earlier discussed, involve an administrative proceeding before an investigating judge or justice who determines, after an investigation, whether the accusations made against the respondent judge are true, and thereafter recommends the appropriate remedy or penalty.<br><br>In this light, due respect should be given the investigating judge or justice’s evaluations of the credibility of the witnesses, and the reliability of the pieces of information that they attest to.&nbsp; Unlike lay jurors, the investigating judge or justice has had years of experience in hearing and evaluating the testimony of witnesses and their demeanor in delivering their testimonies.&nbsp; The risk of overvaluing the import of hearsay evidence is thus minimized by the training and expertise of our investigating judges and justices.<br><br><b><i>Second</i></b>, the strict application of the hearsay rule, in effect, has shielded erring judges and justices from facing the consequences of their corrupt acts.&nbsp; As I earlier noted, the nature of a bribery case necessarily involves secrecy between the corruptor and the corruptee; thus, bribery rarely, if at all, surfaces when the transaction goes as planned.<br><br>Would we have to wait for betrayal, or for ill-relations between the two parties, so that we can find a witness with personal knowledge of the bribery transaction?<br><br>Should this Court simply suffer in silence while practitioners glibly claim that the judiciary is corrupt and at the same time hide behind the hearsay rule when they are held to account for their statements?<br><br><b><i>Third</i></b>, the unnecessarily strict application of hearsay in administrative proceedings of judges has crippled this Court’s capability to discipline its ranks.&nbsp;&nbsp; An examination of bribery cases involving judges&nbsp; show our extreme wariness in declaring that a judge had in fact been bribed, often using the hearsay rule to conclude that insufficiency of evidence prevents us from finding the judge liable for bribery. We would, however, still penalize these judges and dismiss them from office because of acts constituting gross misconduct.<br><br>I cannot help but think that we so acted because, at the back of our minds, we might have believed that the respondent judge had indeed been guilty of bribery, but our over-attachment to the hearsay rule compelled us to shy away from this reason to support our conclusion.&nbsp; Hence, we try to find other ways to penalize the erring judge or justice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>While this indirect approach may ultimately arrive at the desired goal of penalizing erring judges and removing the corrupt from our roster, we should realize that <b><i>this approach surrenders the strong signal that a finding of guilt for bribery makes.</i></b><br><br>It must not be lost on us that we send out a message to the public, to the members of the judiciary, and to the members of the bar, every time we decide a case involving the discipline of judges: we broadcast, by our actions, that we do not tolerate the acts for which we found the erring judge guilty. This message is lost when we penalize judges and justices for gross misconduct other than bribery, when bribery was the real root cause for the disciplinary action.<br><br>I believe that the time has come for this Court to start calling a spade a spade, and make the conclusion that bribery had taken place if and when the circumstances sufficiently prove its occurrence.&nbsp; In making this conclusion, we should not be unduly hindered by technical rules of evidence, including hearsay, as we have the resources and experience to interpret and evaluate the evidence before us and the information it conveys.<br><br>We must not likewise get lost as we wander in our search for the proper degree of supporting evidence in administrative proceedings.&nbsp; This quantum of evidence should be substantial evidence because this standard provides the necessary balance and flexibility in determining the truth behind the accusations against a respondent judge, without sacrificing the necessary fairness that due process accords him and without sacrificing what is due to the institution we serve and the Filipino people.<br><br><b><i>2) The probative value of hearsay evidence in substantial evidence</i></b><br><br>The admission of hearsay evidence does not necessarily translate into belief in the information it provides, hook, line and sinker.&nbsp;&nbsp; To satisfy the substantial evidence requirement for administrative cases, hearsay evidence should necessarily be supplemented, and corroborated by other evidence that are not hearsay.<br><br>We are not completely without experience in admitting and giving due probative value to hearsay testimony.&nbsp; Note, in this regard, our experience in administrative proceedings on the <u><b><i>writ of amparo</i></b></u>, as well as the evaluation of hearsay evidence we do in <b><i><u>child abuse cases.</u></i></b><br><br>In both, we give due regard to information otherwise inadmissible because of the hearsay rule, without giving up the fairness and rule of reason required by the due process clause.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note too, that in both instances, a compelling need exists to relax the exclusionary rule of hearsay evidence<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> – a necessity that is also present in disciplinary proceedings against judges.<br><br>In giving due credence to hearsay evidence, we said in the case of <i>Razon, et. al. v. Tagitis</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br><blockquote>The fair and proper rule, to our mind, is to <b><i>consider all the pieces of evidence adduced in their totality, and to consider any evidence otherwise inadmissible under our usual rules to be admissible if it is consistent with the admissible evidence adduced</i></b>. In other words, we reduce our rules to the most basic test of reason – i.e., to the relevance of the evidence to the issue at hand and its consistency with all other pieces of adduced evidence. Thus, <b>even hearsay evidence can be admitted if it satisfies this basic minimum test</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>If this approach were to be applied to the disciplinary proceedings of judges, I submit that all the evidence relating to or tending to support the underlying act of bribery – regardless of their hearsay nature - can and should be examined.&nbsp; If all the acts alleged are substantially proven to have been committed, and they collectively point to the commission of bribery although not to the level of proof beyond reasonable doubt, then the Court should be well within its rights to find the respondent liable for acts amounting to gross misconduct based on bribery.<br><br>In assessing hearsay evidence, I submit that we consider the following factors:<br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="CENTER">(1) </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">The credibility of the witness, and possible motives or relationship with the interested parties that could taint the reliability of his testimony;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">(2) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">The availability of the declarant to testify in person before the investigating judge or justice as well as his or her general character;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">(3) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">The timing of the statement and the relationship between the declarant and the witness;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">(4)</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Whether the information conveyed by the hearsay evidence had been substantially corroborated in its material points; and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">(5) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">The circumstances surrounding the statement, particularly those pointing to the declarant’s misrepresentation about the respondent’s involvement.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><br><b><i>III. The totality of evidence shows that Justice Ong committed bribery</i></b><br><br>Based on the above factors, I am convinced and hereby ask the Court to join me in the conclusion that the hearsay evidence provided by Luy – specifically, that Justice Ong was Napoles’s contactman in the Sandiganbayan, and that the latter paid him a bribe – should be admitted and given its proper weight when considered alongside other pieces of evidence.<br><br><b><i>First</i></b>, the investigating justice found Luy and Sula to be credible and reliable witnesses whose testimonies even withstood the intense public scrutiny of Senate committee hearings.&nbsp; No evidence has ever been shown that they fabricated their statements about Justice Ong, nor that they harbored ulterior or illegal motives in adducing evidence against Justice Ong.<br><br><b><i>Second</i></b>, Napoles, the declarant of the damning statements about Ong, could not reasonably be made available to testify against Justice Ong, as she would be testifying against her own interest.&nbsp; As I earlier explained, testifying against Justice Ong would amount to the admission by Napoles that she had committed the crime of corruption of a public officer, without any possibility of evading prison sentence by becoming a state witness.<br><br><b><i>Third,</i></b> Napoles’s statements regarding Justice Ong’s assistance in the Kevlar Helmet case, her payment to Justice Ong, as well as her instructions to give checks to Justice Ong, were all made in the course of Luy’s performance as her employee; they were made in confidence and in the course of instructing Luy on how to better undertake the tasks she had asked him to perform.<br><br>In particular, Napoles’s statement that he paid Justice Ong a certain amount was made in reference to <b><i>a ledger she kept of her expenses on the Kevlar Helmet case</i></b>, information that she told Luy in the course of the latter’s employment.<br><br><b><i>Fourth</i></b>, the information derived from the hearsay evidence – that Justice Ong aided Napoles in the Kevlar Helmet case and that Napoles paid him for this assistance – constitutes a reasonable explanation for Justice Ong’s visits to Napoles’s office during which he was given a financial accommodation by Napoles; Justice Ong’s picture with Napoles during a social function; and the highly questionable grant of probation of Napoles’ relatives by Justice Ong – <b><i>pieces of evidence that are not based on hearsay.</i></b><br><br>Further, these pieces of information are corroborated by the testimony of another Napoles employee, Sula, who received information from Napoles in the course of their employer-employee relationship.&nbsp; In her testimony, Sula categorically attested that Napoles identified Justice Ong as her “contactman” in the Sandiganbayan several times; Napoles did this before Sula and before other Napoles employees.<br><br><b><i>Fifth,</i></b> Napoles had no reason to lie or misrepresent that Justice Ong assisted her in the Kevlar Helmet case at the time she made the disclosure to Luy.&nbsp; At that time, Napoles and Luy’s personal and working relationships were close, as they did not only stand as employer and employee to one another; they were members of the same family as they were second cousins.&nbsp; Napoles also disclosed the information to Luy in the course of the latter’s performance of his duties as her employee.&nbsp; There could possibly be no benefit to Napoles in fabricating the fact of Justice Ong’s assistance in the Kevlar Helmet case where she had been acquitted.<br><br>Admitting Luy’s hearsay statement regarding Justice Ong’s assistance to Napoles in the Kevlar Helmet case and giving it its proper weight would – when considered with the rest of the evidence untainted with issues of admissibility – lead to the reasonable conclusion that Justice Ong had committed gross misconduct through acts amounting to bribery.<br><br>As I earlier emphasized, Justice Ong’s assistance to Napoles, as well as his receipt of money from her, reasonably explain Justice Ong’s action in the grant of probation to Napoles’s relatives, the ledger of “Sandiganbayan expenses” that Luy encountered in the course of his employment, as well as Justice Ong’s subsequent visits to Napoles’s office where he was given an advantageous financial accommodation. It additionally explains why Napoles’s employees believed that Justice Ong indeed was her contact man at the Sandiganbayan.<br><br>Taken together, these pieces of evidence provide a cohesive narrative revealing that Napoles gave Justice Ong money in exchange for his assistance in the Kevlar Helmet case, a case that the Fourth Division of the Sandiganbayan (whose Chairman is Justice Ong) decided.<br><br>The act which the public officer committed in exchange for the gift he received need not necessarily be a crime – it may consist of committing an unjust act, or refraining from doing something that is his official duty to do, so long as it is connected with the performance of his official duties.&nbsp; Assisting a litigant towards a successful avoidance of a criminal sentence or imprisonment involves such an unjust act.<br><br>Worthy of note too, that specifying the act which the repondent judge committed to doing in exchange for the gift he accepted is immaterial for purposes of determining whether he committed gross misconduct arising from acts amounting to bribery.<br><br>Bribery, as defined in the Revised Penal Code, has two forms:<b><i> first, direct bribery</i></b>, which may be committed by accepting a gift in exchange for the public official’s (1) performance of a crime, (2) performance of an unjust act and / or (3) refraining from performing his duty.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> These acts must be performed in the course of the public official’s duties in government.<br><br>The <b><i>second</i></b> form involves <b><i>indirect bribery </i></b>– which involves accepting gifts given by virtue of the public official’s position in government, often with the view of exchanging future favors.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Acts which are neither illegal nor unjust, but which are performed in the course of the public official’s duties and in exchange of the gift or favor given to the public official, falls under indirect bribery.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>In these lights, the critical facts necessary to prove bribery, for purposes of determining gross misconduct, are (<i>1</i>) the respondent judge’s&nbsp; act of the receiving a gift or favor, (<i>2</i>) his knowledge that this gift was given by virtue of his office, and (<i>3</i>) the connection between the bribe-giver's interest with the bribe-receiver's office.<br><br>In other words, what is crucial in gross misconduct where bribery is the underlying act is the acceptance of a gift or favor, knowing that the gift or favor is given because of one’s position in the judiciary <i>– i.e., </i>that it was given to persuade the respondent judge or justice to perform an act for the giver. This act may be criminal, unjust, or may even be in line with the respondent judge or justice’s duties.<br><br>Notably, the New Code of Judicial Conduct asks members of the judiciary not only to establish judicial independence and integrity, but to maintain the appearance of these judicial attributes.&nbsp; Judges and justices are given sufficient leeway and discretion in the application of the law and evaluation of the pieces of evidence before him or her, and it is crucial that their exercise of discretion is never compromised.&nbsp; Particularly, their actions cannot be tainted with ulterior motives that our criminal laws cover, such as payment from one of the litigants, regardless of whether such litigant’s cause was in line with the law or not.<br><br>In these lights, the acceptance of a gift or valuable favor from a litigant in one’s court, especially when such litigant had just been acquitted and still had relatives with pending cases in the division one presides over or is a member, already constitutes the underlying act of bribery for purposes of a gross misconduct charge. It involves indirect bribery at the very least because the gift or favor was accepted knowing full well that it was given because of one’s position in the judiciary, not because of any particular private relationship that would justify modest gifts.&nbsp; In such case, the gift would necessary be in exchange for or would be looking up to a favorable act in favor of the giver.<br><br>Applying these principles in these lights, I cannot accept Justice Ong’s attempt to hide behind the Sandiganbayan division’s collegial decision-making process to exonerate himself of the charges against him.&nbsp; That he is just one of five (5) justices in his division is no excuse when it is considered that he speaks for or against the merits of cases pending with his Division.&nbsp; That Justice Ong himself might not have actually drafted the decision in the Kevlar Helmet case does not automatically free him from liability for the acts imputed to and proven against him, as the critical point is his participation in the case.<br><br>Justice Ong acted, in his official capacity as presiding justice and member of the Sandiganbayan Fourth Division, on the decision and motion for reconsideration of the Kevlar Helmet cases. He was identified, by several people who had no cause to implicate him, as Napoles’s contactman in the Sandiganbayan. He even went to Napoles’s office twice before signing probation orders for Napoles’s relatives. During one of those visits, Luy prepared checks to be given to him as an accommodation given to him by Napoles.&nbsp; At that time, Napoles had just been acquitted before Justice Ong’s Division, while the cases of Napoles’ relatives still stood to be acted upon by the Division on the probation aspects.&nbsp; These acts, to my mind, more than reasonably establish his gross misconduct based on the underlying acts of bribery (indirect bribery, at the very least).<br><br><b><i>IV. Assuming arguendo that the hearsay evidence against Justice Ong could not be admitted as evidence, the <u>totality of admissible evidence</u> shows that Justice Ong committed gross misconduct by assisting, claiming to have assisted, or fostering the belief that he assisted Napoles in the Kevlar case.</i></b><br><br><b><i>A.&nbsp;&nbsp; Assessment of Luy and Sula’s testimonies</i></b><br><br>Even with the use of our traditional approach of excluding hearsay evidence in administrative proceedings, I submit that the presented <b><i><u>evidence that are not hearsay</u></i></b> sufficiently prove that Justice Ong committed acts amounting to gross misconduct.&nbsp; His acts after the promulgation of the Kevlar Helmet decision show that he had assisted, claimed to have assisted, or at the very least fostered, the belief that he assisted Napoles in the Kevlar Helmet case.<br><br>A closer examination of Luy and Sula’s testimonies show that they are not entirely without any probative value.&nbsp; A statement made by a witness may, at the same time, be both hearsay and non-hearsay, depending on what it intends to prove.<br><br>If the testimony is used to prove the veracity of a statement that the witness had no personal knowledge of, then the statement is undoubtedly hearsay with respect to the subject of the statement.&nbsp; But if the testimony is used to prove matters other than the veracity of the statement itself<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> and of which the witness has actual knowledge, then the statement is admissible and may be given probative value.&nbsp; This is the independently relevant type of evidence.<br><br>In these lights, evidence that may be hearsay in proving the fact directly in issue (bribery), may be used to prove the surrounding facts, related to the fact directly in issue, that a witness has personal knowledge of, such as the utterance of another person in front of witnesses, <i>albeit</i> the veracity of the uttered statement itself cannot be considered to be directly established.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Further, it may also be used to show the other person’s state of mind, physical and mental condition, knowledge, belief, intention, and other emotions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; The latter, notably, coincides with Rule 130, Section 48 of the Rules of Court, that allows a witness to present his opinion on the emotion, behavior, condition, or appearance of a person.<br><br>Admittedly, the purpose for which a piece of evidence is offered must be manifested to the court at the time the evidence is offered and presented.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> This aspect, however, is where the leniency of administrative cases on the technical rules of evidence comes in.&nbsp; Thus, although no distinction had been made as to the purpose of the testimonies, probative value may be given to and separated from their hearsay aspects, particularly to the extent that a statement is independently relevant to the issue at hand.<br><br>Applied to the present case, we can - without refusing to apply the hearsay rule – give credence to Luy’s statement insofar as it proves that (<i>1</i>) Napoles plainly stated that she had been talking to Justice Ong while the Kevlar Helmet case was pending in the Sandiganbayan and that she gave the latter money to assist her, (<i>2</i>) that her demeanor at the time she uttered this statement was calm and confident, and (<i>3</i>) that during the conversation when Napoles uttered these statements, she appeared confident that she would be acquitted in the Kevlar Helmet case.<br><br>In other words, while we do not use Luy and Sula’s statements to establish that Napoles had been telling the truth regarding Justice Ong’s involvement in acquitting her in the Kevlar Helmet case, we still can accept that she uttered these statements to Luy, a person closely related to her and whose work involved confidential matters entrusted only to a trusted associate or employee.<br><br>To reiterate, Luy was not merely an employee of Napoles; he is also her second cousin, and has assisted her in her operations (now being questioned for its linkages in the illegal use of the Priority Development Assistance Fund) for a considerable length of time. We can also accept Luy’s impressions of Napoles’ state of mind and emotions at the time she uttered these statements – <i>i.e.,</i> a person confident that she would be acquitted.&nbsp; Significantly, she was in fact acquitted.&nbsp; From the time of this acquittal, the proven acts of meetings, socials and financial accommodation followed.<br><br>With respect to Luy’s testimony on the financial accommodation that Napoles gave Justice Ong, we can derive from his statements the following non-hearsay aspects:<br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="CENTER">(1) </div></td> <td valign="TOP" width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Justice Ong visited Napoles’ office twice;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">(2) </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">During one of those visits, Napoles received a check worth Php 25.5 million;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">(3) </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">That in exchange for the Php25.5 million check, Luy was asked to prepare 11 checks to be issued by Napoles with Justice Ong as the payee;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">(4)</div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">That these checks contain an aggregate amount of Php25.5 million plus 13% interest;

They also establish that Justice Ong afterwards received a favor from Napoles, as he exchanged his Php25.5 million check with 11 checks totaling to Php25.5 million with 13% interest.<br><br>Whether Justice Ong’s check for Php25.5 million was funded, or had been encashed by Napoles, unfortunately, are unanswered questions from the evidence of the present case.&nbsp; <b><i>If that check had not been funded</i></b>, then Napoles effectively gave Justice Ong Php25.5 million, plus 13% of this sum, under the guise of the transaction they entered.&nbsp; On the other hand, <b><i>if that check had indeed been funded,</i></b> then a very interesting document to see would be Justice Ong’s Statement of Assets and Liabilities, his <b><i>SALN</i></b>.<br><br><b>What, if I may ask, was worth this much to Napoles at that time?</b><br><br>The totality of the pieces of evidence presented before the Court yield the following factual conclusions:<br><br>The two witnesses, both of whom were found credible by the investigating justice, testified that Napoles had been confident of her acquittal in the Kevlar Helmet case through Justice Ong’s assistance.&nbsp; This confidence, according to Luy, was exhibited by Napoles even prior to the Sandiganbayan’s decision on the Kevlar Helmet case.<br><br>Napoles had indeed been acquitted by the Fourth Division that Justice Ong then chaired (and still chairs).&nbsp; Meanwhile, her relatives, who had been her co-accused, were found guilty of falsification of public documents but never spent a minute in jail due to Justice Ong’s direct action on this aspect of the Kevlar Helmet case.<br><br>We are aware though that the probation order came in the early part of 2013;<i> i.e.</i>, after Justice Ong’s established interactions with Napoles in 2012.&nbsp; <b><u><i>Napoles and Justice Ong were photographed together at a social event in 2012</i>.&nbsp; During the same year, Justice Ong visited Napoles’s office twice.</u></b><br><br>Further, during one of those visits, Napoles allegedly received a check worth Php25.5 million, and initially intended to issue 11 checks reflecting Php25.5 million plus 13% interest with Justice Ong’s name as payee.&nbsp; These checks, however, were ultimately made payable to cash.<br><br>A discordant note in all these is Justice Ong’s claim that he visited Napoles to ask for her assistance in accessing the robe of the Black Nazarene in Quiapo.&nbsp; This claim, however, does not need to negate the credit of Luy’s testimony that he prepared the checks as both can be accomplished in one visit.&nbsp; (Or, there might have been other visits.)&nbsp; Others also attested to Justice Ong’s visits to Napoles in 2012 and, significantly, other than his lame reference to the deity and unabashed play for sympathy through religion, Justice Ong never presented any evidence to disprove these points.<br><br>I find it too much of a coincidence that the Sandiganbayan justice that Napoles had been boasting about as the one who would help her in the Kevlar Helmet case, is the same justice that she socially mingled with (as shown by their photograph in a party), and the same justice that had twice personally visited her in her office in 2012.&nbsp;&nbsp; Justice Ong, too, is apparently one justice who could issue a check for Php25.5 million.<br><br>The more logical explanation for all these events, to my mind, is that Justice Ong and Napoles have been more than passing acquaintances long before 2012. Justice Ong had been visiting Napoles at her office, and had been present in at least one party where he was photographed with Napoles and no less than a senator of the realm. These suggest relationships at both the official and social levels and should be read with the direct testimony of what Napoles told her employees about her acquittal and the actual fact of acquittal.<br><br>Additionally, Ong had transacted with Napoles to the tune of Php25.5 million, a fact also directly testified to by Luy.<br><br>I submit that the confluence of these facts and events cannot but lead a reasonable mind to believe that respondent Justice Ong, at the very least, assisted or, to be exact, extended favors to Napoles and her relatives in the Kevlar Helmet case.<br><br>Assisting or claiming to have assisted a litigant in a case pending or decided by the court he sits in, or allowing the belief that he assisted in the said case violate several canons in the New Code of Judicial Conduct pertaining to integrity and impartiality.&nbsp; <b><u>Canon 2, Section 1</u></b>, requires judges to “ensure that not only is their conduct above reproach, but that it is perceived to be so in the view of a reasonable observer.”<br><br>Further, <b><u>Canon 3, Section 2</u></b> instructs judges to “ensure that his or her conduct, both in and out of court, maintains and enhances the confidence of the public, the legal profession and litigants in the impartiality of the judge and of the Judiciary.”<br><br>Judges must not only perform their duties with impartiality and integrity, but must ensure that these duties appear to have been executed with impartiality and integrity.&nbsp;&nbsp; Acts of assisting or making litigants believe that they have been assisted by the judge hearing his or her case not only reflects on his partiality and questionable integrity, it also reflects badly for the reputation of the judiciary, as it gives the impression that justice can be bought.&nbsp; <b><u>That the Sandiganbayan, the country’s anti-graft court, is involved in a corrupt practice should not be without significance to the Court.</u></b><br><br>Worse, as the accused in the present case is a member of the judiciary, it sends out the additional message that the one who dispenses justice can also be the same justice who sells it.&nbsp; Considering the grave repercussions of Justice Ong’s violations, I find it logically incomprehensible to characterize his acts as less than a serious charge, and I find it morally reprehensible to impose a penalty less than dismissal with prejudice. The Court should likewise forward its record of this case to the Ombudsman for whatever action she may deem proper under the circumstances.<br><br>In sum, given the nature of the disciplinary proceedings for judges and the circumstances proven in the present case, <b><u>I strongly believe that Justice Ong is no longer worthy of being identified as one of our colleagues in the judiciary</u></b>. We should, at the soonest possible time, act on this already-delayed case with dispatch, dismiss him as recommended by Justice Villarama, and thereby give the strongest signal to the country of our intent to purify our ranks.<br><br>As <b><u>one final point</u></b>, I also invite the Court’s attention to the underlying case that ultimately gave rise to the accusation against Justice Ong.&nbsp; It was a case involving <b><u>Kevlar Helmets.</u></b><br><br>To the uninitiated, <b><u>these are the helmets that the members of our military use as they fight battles for us who continue to live in the relative safety and comfort of our homes</u></b>.&nbsp; Any irregularity in these purchases means that less than the ideal exchange had been secured by the purchasing government in the transaction.&nbsp; It is painful to realize that this irregularity – proven by no less than the conviction of several officers of the military as well as Napoles’ relatives – had been at the possible expense of the members of the military who risk their lives for the rest of our society.&nbsp; <b><u>If only for this, the Court should be aware, sensitive, and critical, in viewing the present case.&nbsp; Even if only to this extent, let us signal to the military how we feel for and appreciate them.</u></b><br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>RE: Interview with Lorna Kapunan on Corruption in the Judiciary</i>, A.M.

According to Wigmore, these judges began to exclude hearsay because of a perception that the juries used in common law trials tended to overvalue such evidence in the absence of cross-examination. This overvaluation occurred because these untrained and inexperienced jurors failed to fully appreciate the potential sources of weakness in testimonial evidence when it was untested by cross-examination.</blockquote><br><i>See also</i>: John Henry Wigmore, <i>The History of the Hearsay Rule</i>, 17 Harv L Rev 437, 438 – 439 (1904).<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> In <i>Richardson v.

American Law Institute / UNIDROIT’s <i>Principles of Transantional Civil Procedure </i>has recognised this concept. These English evidential changes will now be listed. The English ‘hearsay rule’ used to provide a barrier to admitting relevant evidence. This rule concerned second-hand or remoter reports of oral statements (for example, if the defendant withsed to adduce evidence, through one of his witnesses, who proposed to state that the ‘claimant told me that his wife had said, “let’s concoct a claim against these people””), The hearsay rule also concerned documents composed out-of-court. But there has now been a fundamental change. Since 1995, statute has allowed a party to use out-of-court oral statements, and documents, as evidence: ‘In civil proceedings evidence shall not be excluded on the ground that it is hearsay’, that is, ‘a statement made otherwise than by a person giving oral evidence.’ Instead, the court must to assess the ‘weight’ to be attached to the hearsay evidence.

The Court amply explained this in <i>Patula v. People</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br><blockquote>To elucidate why x x x hearsay evidence was unreliable and untrustworthy, and thus devoid of probative value, reference is made to Section 36 of Rule 130, <i>Rules of Court</i>, a rule that states that a witness can testify only to those facts that she knows of her personal knowledge; that is, which are derived from her own perception, except as otherwise provided in the <i>Rules of Court.</i> <b>The personal knowledge of a witness is a substantive prerequisite for accepting testimonial evidence that establishes the truth of a disputed fact. A witness bereft of personal knowledge of the disputed fact cannot be called upon for that purpose because her testimony derives its value not from the credit accorded to her as a witness presently testifying but from the veracity and competency of the extrajudicial source of her information.<br><br>In case a witness is permitted to testify based on what she has heard another person say about the facts in dispute, the person from whom the witness derived the information on the facts in dispute is not in <i>court</i> and <i>under oath </i>to be examined and cross-examined. The weight of such testimony then depends not upon the veracity of the witness but upon the veracity of the other person giving the information to the witness without oath. The information cannot be tested because the declarant is not standing in court as a witness and cannot, therefore, be cross-examined.<br><br>It is apparent, too, that a person who relates a hearsay is not obliged to enter into any particular, to answer any question, to solve any difficulties, to reconcile any contradictions, to explain any obscurities, to remove any ambiguities; and that she entrenches herself in the simple assertion that she was told so, and leaves the burden entirely upon the dead or absent author. Thus, the rule against hearsay testimony rests mainly on the ground that there was no opportunity to cross-examine the declarant. The testimony may have been given under oath and before a court of justice, but if it is offered against a party who is afforded no opportunity to cross-examine the witness, it is hearsay just the same.<br><br>Moreover, the theory of the hearsay rule is that when a human utterance is offered as evidence of the truth of the fact asserted, the credit of the assertor becomes the basis of inference, and, therefore, the assertion can be received as evidence only when made on the witness stand, subject to the test of cross-examination. However, if an extrajudicial utterance is offered, not as an assertion to prove the matter asserted but without reference to the truth of the matter asserted, the hearsay rule does not apply. For example, in a slander case, if a prosecution witness testifies that he heard the accused say that the complainant was a thief, this testimony is admissible not to prove that the complainant was really a thief, but merely to show that the accused uttered those words. This kind of utterance is hearsay in character but is not legal hearsay. The distinction is, therefore, between (a) the fact that the statement was made, to which the hearsay rule does not apply, and (b) the truth of the facts asserted in the statement, to which the hearsay rule applies.<br><br>Section 36, Rule 130 of the <i>Rules of Court</i> is understandably not the only rule that explains why testimony that is hearsay should be excluded from consideration. Excluding hearsay also aims to preserve the right of the opposing party to cross-examine the <i>original </i>declarant claiming to have a direct knowledge of the transaction or occurrence. If hearsay is allowed, the right stands to be denied because the declarant is not in court. It is then to be stressed&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; right to cross-examine&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; adverse party’s witness, being the only means of testing the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies, is essential to the administration of justice.</b><br><br>To address the problem of controlling inadmissible hearsay as evidence to establish the truth in a dispute while also safeguarding a party’s right to cross-examine her adversary’s witness, the <i>Rules of Court</i> offers two solutions. The first solution is to require that <i>all</i> the witnesses in a judicial trial or hearing be examined only in court <i>under oath or affirmation</i>. Section 1, Rule 132 of the <i>Rules of Court</i> formalizes this solution, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>Section 1.<i> Examination to be done in open court. </i>- The examination of witnesses presented in a trial or hearing shall be done in open court, and under oath or affirmation. Unless the witness is incapacitated to speak, or the question calls for a different mode of answer, the answers of the witness shall be given orally. (1a)</blockquote><br>The second solution is to require that <i>all </i>witnesses be <i>subject to the cross-examination by the adverse party.</i> Section 6, Rule 132 of the Rules of Court ensures this solution thusly:<br><br><blockquote>Section 6. <i>Cross-examination; its purpose and extent.</i> – Upon the termination of the direct examination, the witness may be cross-examined by the adverse party as to any matters stated in the direct examination, or connected therewith, with sufficient fullness and freedom to test his accuracy and truthfulness and freedom from interest or bias, or the reverse, and to elicit all important facts bearing upon the issue. (8a)<br></blockquote><br>Although the second solution traces its existence to a Constitutional precept relevant to criminal cases,<i> i.e.</i>, Section 14, (2), Article III, of the 1987 Constitution, which guarantees that: “<i>In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall xxx enjoy the right xxx to meet the witnesses face to face xxx</i>,” the rule requiring the cross-examination by the adverse party equally applies to non-criminal proceedings.<br><br><b>We thus stress that the rule excluding hearsay as evidence is based upon serious concerns about the trustworthiness and reliability of hearsay evidence due to its not being given under oath or solemn affirmation and due to its not being subjected to cross-examination by the opposing counsel to test the perception, memory, veracity and articulateness of the out-of-court declarant or actor upon whose reliability the worth of the out-of-court statement depends</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote><br>In addition, the Majority adverted to the following statements of Luy and Sula, to wit: (<i>a</i>) Luy and Sula saw Justice Ong visit Napoles in her office; (<i>b</i>) there was a ledger listing Napoles’s alleged “Sandiganbayan” expenses; and (<i>c</i>) Luy personally prepared the 11 checks allegedly issued by Napoles to Justice Ong as advance interest for the latter’s deposit in AFPSLAI as the basis for concluding that Justice Ong’s association with Napoles was more than merely casual; and that such association was instrumental in Napoles’s acquittal in the Kevlar case supposedly orchestrated by Justice Ong in return for monetary consideration.<br><br>I cannot agree with the Majority.<br><br>Justice Ong admitted making visits to Napoles, but such visits apparently happened in 2012, or long after the promulgation of the decision in the Kevlar case.&nbsp; He maintained that he had made his visits only to thank her for accommodating his request for access to the robe of the Black Nazarene.<br><br>The claim about the ledger and checks remained uncorroborated.&nbsp; No ledger or checks or any other documents indicating the preparation of the ledger or the issuance of the checks were actually presented. Nor was the connection of such ledger or the checks to the fixing of the Kevlar case for monetary consideration ever established. In that light, the adverse statements by Luy and Sula remained to be mere allegations that could not be considered as evidence by any means.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>If the Majority concede that there was no sufficient evidence to support the charge of bribery and corruption against Justice Ong, it became unreasonable for the Majority to hold that the totality of the circumstances still showed his corrupt inclination. To let ourselves as judges reach a conclusion of corrupt inclination despite the insufficient basis to find bribery and corruption is to set at naught all our learning of rendering a judgment of guilt only upon evidence that is sufficient, credible and reliable.<br><br>Having admitted visiting Napoles after the promulgation of the decision in the Kevlar case, Justice Ong could be considered as fraternizing with a litigant, by which he surely transgressed his duty as a judge to be beyond reproach and suspicion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> He thereby violated Section 1 of Canon 4 (<i>Propriety</i>) of the New Code of Judicial Conduct.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Yet, such association with Napoles was still censurable.

Luy had no personal knowledge about the conversation between Napoles and Justice Ong during the latter’s visit; about whether Justice Ong assented to an arrangement with Napoles; and about whether Justice Ong did issue a BDO check.&nbsp; The only thing Luy was competent to testify about is his preparation of eleven (11) checks, purportedly for Justice Ong, at the direction of Napoles.&nbsp; <b>But, just the same, Luy does not have any personal knowledge whether the eleven (11) checks were indeed given to Justice Ong or whether Justice Ong received and accepted such checks.</b><br><br>Justice Leonen, in his <i>Reflections</i>, however, opined that we ought to consider as established Justice Ong’s receipt of the eleven (11) checks because “<i>even if Luy was not in Unit 2501 when Napoles handed the checks to Justice Ong, <u>there could be no other conclusion to be derived from the facts.</u>”</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; I respectfully disagree with Justice Leonen’s analysis.<br><br>In my opinion, it is precisely the fact that <b>no one was able to see and observe Justice Ong receiving the eleven (11) checks</b> that a contrary conclusion <i>i.e.</i>, that Justice Ong never received any checks from Napoles, finds reason.&nbsp; And this conclusion becomes all the more reasonable if we consider that no one, neither Luy nor Sula, was able to testify regarding the existence of any returned checks and that no such checks were ever submitted in evidence.<br><br>Hence, I opine that the existence of a so-called “<i>financial deal”</i> between Justice Ong and Napoles was not established in this case.<br><br><b><i>Even Assuming The Existence of <br>The Financial Deal, Evidence Still<br> Does Not Support Finding of Bribery<br> in the Kevlar Cases</i></b><br><br>Moreover, even assuming<i> arguendo</i> that the statements of Luy suffice to establish the existence of a financial deal between Justice Ong and Napoles, the same cannot still establish that there had been bribery in the <i>Kevlar Cases</i>.&nbsp; To conclude that the consideration for the financial deal was Napoles’ acquittal in the <i>Kevlar Cases</i> is equivalent to mere speculation:<br><br><i>First</i>.&nbsp; There is no direct evidence establishing that the financial deal was a bribe.&nbsp; Even Luy himself does not say so.&nbsp; Hence, any conclusion of bribery can only be inferred from circumstantial evidence.<br><br><i>Second</i>.&nbsp; There is, however, no circumstantial evidence on record from which the conclusion of bribery may be inferred.&nbsp; At the very least, there should have been evidence to show that Justice Ong and Napoles had been communicating during the pendency of the <i>Kevlar Cases.</i>&nbsp; There is no evidence of such communication in this case—except, the hearsay testimonies of Luy and Sula.<br><br><i>Third.</i>&nbsp; The conclusion of bribery cannot be inferred from the financial deal itself.&nbsp; The deal, it must be emphasized, was entered into two (2) years after the decision in the<i> Kevlar Cases</i> was promulgated.&nbsp; While not impossible, the likelihood that the financial deal was a bribe becomes remote given the considerable amount of time that passed between Napoles’ acquittal and the purported pay-off.<br><br><i>Fourth</i>.&nbsp; The conclusion of bribery cannot be inferred from the accommodating nature of the financial deal.&nbsp; Indeed, if Luy’s statements as to the existence of the financial deal were to be believed as the truth, then the deal itself cannot really be considered as an “<i>accommodation</i>.”&nbsp; Justice Ong, as Luy recounted, had to issue a check of his own in exchange of the eleven (11) checks of Napoles.&nbsp; The implication is that Justice Ong was not issued the eleven (11) checks out of thin air or as a pay-off; rather, Justice Ong allowed the use of his own money as consideration for the checks he allegedly received.&nbsp; Hence, the financial deal can stand as a transaction away from bribery.<br><br>Since there is neither direct nor circumstantial evidence to support a finding of bribery, concluding still that there was such bribery would be mere speculation.&nbsp; It would not be a <i>“reasonable”</i> conclusion warranted by substantial evidence.&nbsp; From Luy’s own story, bribery is plainly and simply speculative.<br><br><center><b>II</b></center><br>My second objection with the majority decision is the characterization of Justice Ong’s association with Napoles as gross misconduct.&nbsp; I opine that the same is merely a simple misconduct.<br><br><b><i>Extent of Justice Ong’s Association<br>with Napoles</i></b><br><br>As established by the evidence, Justice Ong began associating with Napoles two (2) years after <i>Kevlar Cases</i> were decided.&nbsp; Justice Ong himself admitted the entire breadth of this “<i>association</i>:”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br><i>First.</i>&nbsp; At the birthday party of Senator Estrada in 2012, where Justice Ong was first formally introduced to Napoles.&nbsp; The two talked about the Black Nazarene.&nbsp; They exchanged cellphone numbers.&nbsp; It was also here that Justice Ong requested the help of Napoles in gaining access to the robe of the Black Nazarene.<br><br><i>Second.</i>&nbsp; Sometime after the birthday of Senator Estrada, Justice Ong received a call from Napoles asking him to go the Adoracion Chapel in Makati.&nbsp; Justice Ong went to the Adoracion Chapel and was picked up by a car that brought him to a house in a posh subdivision.&nbsp; Inside the house, Justice Ong was able to meet up with Napoles and one Monsignor Ramirez—the parish priest of Quiapo Church.&nbsp; Here, arrangements were made for Justice Ong to wear the robe of the Black Nazarene.&nbsp; Weeks after, Justice Ong was able to wear the robe of the Black Nazarene and he received fragrant cotton balls from the image.<br><br><i>Third</i>.&nbsp; Sometime after that, Justice Ong went to Napoles’ office twice.<br><br><b><u>The above are the only instances of Justice Ong’s association with Napoles that have been duly supported and established by competent evidence.</u></b><br><br><b><i>Justice Ong’s Association with<br>Napoles is Mere Simple Misconduct </i></b><br><br>It is my considered opinion that Justice Ong’s association with Napoles only constitutes simple misconduct.<br><br>Unlike the case of fraternization between judges and litigants with still pending cases, there is no rule of ethics that categorically prohibits and sanctions fraternization between judges and their <i>former </i>litigants.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; Be that as it may, cases of fraternization between judges and their former litigants may still be held unethical <b><i>if found to be done for a corrupt purpose or in such manner that violates any of the norms of propriety and integrity that every member of the bench ought to possess. </i></b> The ethical implications of fraternizations between judges and their former litigants, therefore, must be evaluated on a case-to-case basis.<br><br>The case of Justice Ong and his association with Napoles, though done years after the Kevlar Cases have been decided and not for any proven corrupt purpose, remain unethical because theirs was not a case of simple fraternization.&nbsp; Aside from socializing with Napoles, Justice Ong—by his own admission no less—received <i><b>favors</b></i> (<i>i.e</i>., the arrangements made by Napoles providing access to the robe of the Black Nazarene) from the former that, though innocent, could nonetheless be mistaken by the public as related to his judgeship.&nbsp; Justice Ong’s receipt of such favors from Napoles, therefore, had the effect of compromising his image of impartiality and integrity as it has indeed given the story of bribery the appearance of reality.&nbsp; As it has affected the judgeship of Justice Ong, so has it affected the court to which he belongs.<br><br>For such indiscretion, Justice Ong undoubtedly committed violations of Section 1 of Canon 2 and Section 1 of Canon 4 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct:<br><br><blockquote><center><b>CANON 2: INTEGRITY</b><br></center><br>SECTION 1.

Judges shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all of their activities.</blockquote><br>These violations of Justice Ong, however, cannot be considered as gross misconduct but mere <i>simple misconduct</i>.&nbsp; Gross misconduct means a transgression of some established and definite rule of action that is willful, flagrant or animated by corrupt motives.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; Gross misconduct implies the existence of malice or gross negligence, which reflects the corrupt character of the actor.&nbsp; Malice or corruption, however, has not been established on the part of Justice Ong.<br><br>Justice Ong, therefore, is only accountable for simple misconduct, i.e., a plain transgression of established norms but without the elements of willfulness, malice or corruption.<br><br><b><i>No Flagrant Disregard of Rules</i></b><br><br>In his <i>Reflections</i>, however, Justice Leonen opined that Justice Ong’s association with Napoles is still a gross misconduct despite absence of any evidence that taints such association with corruption.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; He claims that even sans the element of corruption, Justice Ong’s violations of ethical standards may still be considered gross misconduct because they constitute “<i>flagrant disregard of rules</i>.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>I agree that “flagrant disregard of rules” may qualify an otherwise simple misconduct into a gross one but I discount its existence in this case.&nbsp; In my view, Justice Ong’s receipt of arrangements regarding the robe of the Black Nazarene and his visits to Napoles thereafter does not show a <i>“propensity to disregard the rules</i>”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> on his part.<br><br>Flagrant disregard of rules may indeed exist outside the concept of corruption but it does require more than the mere act of violating an ethical norm.&nbsp; I submit that in order to consider a violation of an ethical norm as a <i>“flagrant disregard”</i> we must consider the circumstances under which such violation was committed.&nbsp; <b>The circumstances must show precisely a<i> “propensity to disregard the rules”</i> on the part of the actor—something that is deliberate or malicious and which relates to the very moral fibre of the actor; not the result of a mere simple indiscretion.</b><br><br>Justice Ong’s receipt of arrangements regarding the robe of the Black Nazarene and his visits to Napoles thereafter undoubtedly resulted in a violation of our ethical norms but it is not a flagrant violation.&nbsp; We may consider perhaps the following circumstances:&nbsp; the acts were committed two (2) years after the Kevlar cases were decided; the receipt by Justice Ong of the arrangements regarding the Black Nazarene were motivated not by anything illicit but by an all too human religious devotion; such arrangements were of no significant pecuniary value; the subsequent visits to Napoles’ office were not shown to have been made for any purpose other than to extend thanks to Napoles for the religious favor.&nbsp; <b>These circumstances, though certainly not justifying, nonetheless speak that the actuations by Justice Ong was motivated not by any malicious intent to violate the established rules judicial ethics but more reasonably was the result of a mere momentary lapse of discretion.</b><br><br>Hence, I discount the existence of a “flagrant disregard of rules” on the part of Justice Ong.<br><br><center><b>III</b></center><br>I also object to the majority’s finding that Justice Ong had been dishonest with this Court.<br><br><b><i>Findings of Dishonesty Has No Basis</i></b><br><br>In finding the existence of dishonesty on the part of Justice Ong, the majority pointed to the former’s somewhat deliberate attempt to conceal his visits to Napoles’ office as inferred from the following circumstances:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br><ol><li>In his <i>Letter dated 26 September 2013</i> to the Chief Justice, Justice Ong never mentioned that he visited Napoles’ office twice in 2012.<br><br></li><li>In his<i> Comment</i>, Justice Ong mentioned of only one instance he visited Napoles’ office, <i>i.e., </i>the single occasion referred to by witness Sula in her supplemental affidavit.</li></ol><br>I respectfully disagree.&nbsp; The instances, from which the inference of concealment was drawn, were taken out of context.<br><br><i>First.</i>&nbsp; Justice Ong’s <i>Letter dated 26 September 2013 </i>came at the heels of the 30 August 2013 <i>Rappler</i> report that depicted him as having “<i>partied</i>” with the Napoleses and which featured a controversial photograph of him, Napoles and Senator Estrada in some gathering. Verily, as confirmed by Justice Ong, his main purpose in writing the said letter was for it to serve as a direct response to the impression created by the said report and photograph that he had attended a<i> party</i> or<i> social event</i> that was <i>hosted by Napoles</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Given the purpose of the <i>Letter,</i> it becomes understandable why Justice Ong’s statements therein were only limited to rebutting the <i>Rappler </i>report and explaining the context and circumstance of the photograph.&nbsp; Justice Ong could not be expected to mention therein anything about his subsequent <i>private visits </i>to Napoles’ office because those matters were not, in the first place, brought up by the <i>Rappler</i> report and photograph.&nbsp; Hence, Justice Ong’s silence in the Letter with respect to his visits to Napoles’ office cannot be taken against him.<br><br><i>Second</i>.&nbsp; In his <i>Comment,</i> Justice Ong never stated that he only visited Napoles’ office once.&nbsp; Justice Ong mentioned and described only one occasion of his visit to Napoles’ office because he was, by then, responding to the sole instance in which he was seen by Sula in Napoles’ office.&nbsp; Hence, the use by Justice Ong of the phrase: <i>“This is the single occasion that Sula was talking about in her supplemental affidavit…”</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Justice Ong never made any representations that he only visited the office of Napoles once.<br><br>At any rate, when asked during the investigation as to how many times he had visited Napoles’ office, Justice Ong candidly admitted doing so twice:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Justice Gutierrez<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q:&nbsp; Did you go there?<br><br>Justice Ong<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A:&nbsp; Yes, your honor.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q:&nbsp; The second time as claimed by the whistleblowers?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A:&nbsp; Yes, I went there <b>twice</b>, your honor.&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote><br>Hence, I find no cause in holding Justice Ong accountable for dishonesty.<br><br><b><i>Findings of Dishonesty By Justice Leonen</i></b><br><br>In addition to those pointed out by the majority, Justice Leonen further cites the following instances purportedly indicative of Justice Ong’s dishonesty:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br><ol><li> In the <i>Rappler</i> article, Justice Ong was documented as saying that he did not know who Napoles was or that the latter was a former litigant of his at the time the photograph featured in the article was taken.&nbsp; However, Justice Ong contradicted this fact during the investigation when he revealed that on the occasion when such photograph was taken, Napoles thanked him for her acquittal in the <i>Kevlar Cases</i>.<br><br></li><li>Justice Ong, in his <i>Comment,</i> stated that he never attended a social event hosted by Napoles.&nbsp; However, during the investigation, Justce Ong admitted to having attended a Eucharistic mass arranged by Napoles.<br><br></li><li>Justice Ong had the propensity to conceal his association with Napoles as much as possible and he only accommodated more details into his story as he was confronted with more facts about such association.&nbsp; Thus, when confronted only with a picture of him and Napoles in some gathering, Justice Ong limited his association with Napoles to their attendance in Senator Estrada’s party.&nbsp; But later, when confronted with the testimony of Marina Sula who recounted having seen him visit the office of Napoles once, Justice Ong explained in his <i>Comment </i>only the circumstances of that one visit.&nbsp; And still later on, when confronted by Luy’s statement during the investigation to the effect that he visited Napoles’ office twice, Justice Ong’s story evolved so as to accommodate that second visit as well.</li></ol><br>Again, I respectfully disagree.&nbsp; The cited instances of dishonesty may be explained otherwise:<br><br><i>First</i>.&nbsp; The first cited instance of dishonesty is premised on the fact that the photograph featuring Napoles with Justice Ong was taken <i>after </i>the two were formally introduced to each other.&nbsp; But such fact had never been established.&nbsp; It could have been otherwise.<br><br><i>Second</i>.&nbsp; The second instance of dishonesty may be explained by the fact that when Justice Ong mentioned the word “<i>social event</i>” in his <i>Comment</i> he was basically referring to events such as parties or any social gatherings similar to that of a birthday party.&nbsp; This is likely so because Justice Ong used the word “<i>social event</i>” primarily as a response to the impression created by the photograph featured in the <i>Rappler</i> article—which depicts a party or a similar event.&nbsp; Under those terms, it is understandable that Justice Ong may not have considered a Eucharistic mass as a “<i>social event.</i>”<br><br><i>Third</i>.&nbsp; The third instance of dishonesty just stretches reasonable appreciation of Justice Ong’s statements.&nbsp; Justice Ong, of course, can only be expected to reveal so much as is required by the subject of inquiry at any given time.&nbsp; When the subject of inquiry, however, shifted to the entire gamut of his association with Napoles, like what happened during the investigation stage, Justice Ong was candid enough to reveal them in its entirety.&nbsp; To assume that the reason why Justice Ong revealed his association with Napoles piece by piece was because he was trying to avoid disclosure of his entire association with Napoles is to presume bad faith without any corroboration whatsoever.<br><br>Hence, I maintain that there remains no categorical indication that Justice Ong attempted to be dishonest with this Court.<br><br><center><b>IV</b></center><br>Justice Ong then was shown liable only for simple misconduct which, under Section 9 of Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, is merely a less serious charge.&nbsp; Under Section 11 of the same rule, the sanction for committing a less serious charge could either be suspension from office without salary and other benefits for not less than one (1) nor more than three (3) months or a fine not exceeding P10,000.00 but not exceeding P20,000.00.<br><br>It must also be considered, however, that Justice Ong was already previously fined P15,000.00 by this Court in the administrative case <b><i>Jamsani-Rodriguez v. Ong</i></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>This being his second offense, I deem it proper to sanction Justice Ong with the maximum period of suspension from office allowable for less serious charges.<br><br><b>IN VIEW WHEREOF</b>, I cast my vote in favor of finding Associate Justice Gregory S. Ong of the Sandiganbayan guilty of<b> SIMPLE MISCONDUCT,</b> for which he must suffer <b>SUSPENSION FROM OFFICE</b>, without salary or other benefits, for a period of THREE (3) MONTHS.&nbsp; Associate Justice Gregory S. Ong is also <b>STERNLY WARNED</b> that a repetition of the same or similar offenses shall be dealt with more severely.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.<br><br></b>&nbsp;</http:><br><http: www.rappler.com="" newsbreak="" 37673-napoles-anti-graft-court-justice=""><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>

Ong (Justice Ong) are insufficient to sustain the charge of bribery against him. That there is no direct evidence that would sufficiently establish that Justice Ong actually received money from Janet Lim-Napoles (Napoles) in exchange for her acquittal in the Kevlar case. Likewise, I agree with the <i>ponencia 's</i> finding that the association between Justice Ong and Napoles had been sufficiently proved; that Justice Ong's act of meeting with Napoles at the latter's office on two occasions, notwithstanding that the decision in the Kevlar case had long been promulgated; violates the rule of propriety under Canon 4 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct.<br><br>I am unable to agree, however, with the <i>ponencia 's </i>conclusion that Justice Ong's association with Napoles "constitutes gross misconduct notwithstanding the absence of direct evidence of corruption or bribery." Although Justice Ong's dealing with Napoles gives the appearance of impropriety, there is a paucity of evidence, however, to conclude that he has a "corrupt inclination" which would merit a finding of gross misconduct on his part and be meted the penalty of dismissal from the service. Further, I do not agree with the<i> ponencia</i> that Justice Ong is guilty of dishonesty when he failed to disclose in his letter to the Chief Justice that he visited Napoles in her office after the promulgation of the decision in the Kevlar case.<br><br><b><i>The charge of bribery and/or<br> corruption against Justice Ong <br>was not sufficiently proved. </i></b><br><br>The charge of gross misconduct against Justice Ong stems from the allegation of bribery against him by "pork barrel scam" whistleblowers Benhur Luy (Luy) and Marina Sula (Sula)" Essentially, Luy and Sula alleged that Napoles solicited the help of Justice Ong in connection with the Kevlar case, which was then pending before the Sandiganbayan.&nbsp; They claimed that Napoles was acquitted of the charge against her in the said case through the intercession of Justice Ong; that Justice Ong obtained monetary consideration in exchange for Napoles' acquittal.<br><br>The accusation of bribery is a very serious charge that would entail not only the dismissal of a judge, in this case an Associate Justice of the Sandiganbayan, but also criminal prosecution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> An accusation of bribery is easy to concoct and difficult to disprove.

The hearsay testimonies of Luy and Sula, without more, are insufficient to prove the charge of bribery against Justice Ong. There were no other evidence presented as regards the alleged bribery of Justice Ong which, when taken together with the hearsay testimonies of Luy and Sula, would support a finding of gross misconduct on the part of Justice Ong.<br><br>The allegation that Justice Ong is the "contact" of Napoles in the Sandiganbayan who helped her secure an acquittal in the Kevlar case remains to be a mere allegation unsupported by any reliable evidence. It is derived from the testimonies of Luy and Sula who testified thereon based not on their personal knowledge but on what Napoles had told them. To stress, the said testimonies of Luy and Sula have no probative value and should not have been considered by the <i>ponencia </i>in the determination of the administrative liability of Justice Ong.<br><br>The "totality of circumstances" adverted to by the <i>ponencia, </i>apparently, only refers to the visit of Justice Ong to the office of Napoles on two occasions after the promulgation of the decision in the Kevlar case, which fact was admitted by Justice Ong. Indeed, from the various evidence presented against Justice Ong, only the fact of his visit to Napoles was sufficiently established. However, as already stated, the fact of Justice Ong's visit to Napoles only supports a finding of impropriety or giving the appearance of impropriety on the part of Justice Ong.<br><br>Impropriety or giving the appearance of impropriety, by fraternizing with a litigant, in this case a former litigant, only amounts to simple misconduct. On this point, the Court's ruling in <i>Atty. Molina v. Judge Paz</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> is instructive, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>In the present administrative case, respondent Judge Paz admitted to facilitating a meeting between Atty. Molina and Mayor Antiporda with the aim of forging a settlement between the warring political factions. Respondent Judge Paz saw himself as a mediator between the contending political factions in the Municipality of Buguey. However, Atty. Molina was at that time facing a multiple murder case in the sala of respondent Judge Paz and the victims of the multiple murder case were the political followers of Mayor Antiporda. In short, respondent Judge Paz held a private meeting with Atty. Molina, who was then accused of multiple murder before respondent Judge. Respondent Judge Paz knew that Atty. Molina was a private prosecutor in the criminal cases against the mayor's son pending with another court. The disputes between the political factions involved grave felonies, which respondent Judge Paz should have known could not be the subject of compromise.<br><br>Canon 2 of the Code of Judicial Conduct provides that a judge should avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all his activities. A judge must not only be impartial, he must also appear to be impartial. Public confidence in the judiciary is eroded by irresponsible or improper conduct of judges. Fraternizing with litigants tarnishes this appearance.<br><br><b>Respondent Judge Paz's actuation constitutes simple misconduct</b>, which for a first offense is punishable with suspension of one month and one day to six months. However, respondent Judge Paz had retired compulsorily on 21 September 1998. In lieu of suspension, respondent Judge Paz should be fined, not P1,000 as recommended by the Investigating Justice, but P20,000 considering that simple misconduct is a less serious charge.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> (Emphasis mine)</blockquote><br>Thus, finding that his conduct violates the rule on propriety under Canon 4 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct, Justice Ong should be held liable for simple misconduct. The charge of simple misconduct is classified under Section 9, Rule 140 of the Rules of Court as a less serious charge. A finding of guilt for a less serious charge carries with it the penalty of either: (a) suspension from office without salary and other benefits for not less than one (1) nor more than three (3) months; or (b) a fine of more than P20,000.00, but not exceeding P40,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>This is already the second offense of Justice Ong; he had previously been fined and sternly warned that a repetition of the same or similar offense in the future will be dealt with more severely.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Accordingly, the maximum penalty for less serious charge should be imposed upon Justice Ong, <i>i.e</i>. suspensiOn from office without salary and other benefits for three (3) months.<br><br><i><b>The charge of dishonesty against<br>Justice Ong is unsubstantiated</b></i>.<br><br>I further disagree with the<i> ponencia 's</i> conclusion that Justice Ong is guilty of dishonesty.

This he did by categorically denying in the said letter that he attended parties or social events hosted by Napoles. He failed to disclose that he twice visited Napoles in her office since he was addressing the insinuation against him in the said article. It may have been a lapse of judgment on his part but it certainly is not dishonesty. In any ease, when allegations came out that he visited the office of Napoles in Discovery Suites Center on two occasions, Justice Ong readily admitted to such fact.

The official or employee concerned shall likewise be subject to administrative disciplinary action and, if found guilty, shall be meted out the penalty of suspension or removal, depending on the seriousness of the offense.

As a subject of constant public scrutiny, judges must accept personal restrictions that might be viewed as burdensome by the ordinary citizen and should do so freely and willingly.

As we have time and again declared: “[D]ishonesty is a malevolent act that has no place in the Judiciary.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup><br><br><b>Justice Ong should be dismissed for<br>his dishonesty</b><br><br>Rule 140, Section 8 of the Rules of Court classifies dishonesty as a serious charge.&nbsp; Rule 140, Section 11(A) provides for a range of penalties:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>Dismissal from service, forfeiture of all or part of the benefits as the Court may determine, and disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned or controlled corporations.&nbsp; <i>Provided, however</i>, That the forfeiture of benefits shall in no case include accrued leave credits;<br><br></li><li>Suspension from office without salary and other benefits for more than three (3) but not exceeding six (6) months; or<br><br></li><li>A fine of more than P20,000.00 but not exceeding P40,000.00.</li></ol></blockquote><br>Justice Bersamin opines that Justice Ong’s dishonesty “did not meet the required seriousness or gravity that would merit the extreme penalty of dismissal.”&nbsp; Justice Bersamin applied the standard that for there to be dishonesty that is subject to the penalty of dismissal, the act of dishonesty should relate to Justice Ong’s official duties or qualifications as a justice of the Sandiganbayan.<br><br>I cannot agree with Justice Bersamin’s assessment.&nbsp; Justice Ong’s dishonesty was related to his qualifications as a justice of the Sandiganbayan.&nbsp; He might not have placed a false entry in his personal data sheet for the Judicial Bar Council to assess,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> but he concealed truth that affects his fitness to be a member of the judiciary.&nbsp; The Code of Judicial Conduct requires propriety from its members.&nbsp; This qualification of a justice should be constant and should be met by a justice at all times.&nbsp; When Justice Ong committed dishonest acts to conceal his impropriety, his dishonesty related to his qualifications as a Sandiganbayan justice.<br><br>The dishonesty of Justice Ong did not only pertain to a single act.&nbsp; Taken together, this set of acts reveals a propensity of Justice Ong to be dishonest.&nbsp; For dishonesty alone, he should be meted the penalty of dismissal.<br><br><center><b>III<br>Grave misconduct</b></center><br>Time and again, this court has clarified what can be considered as misconduct.&nbsp; Thus:<br><br><blockquote>Misconduct has been defined as improper or wrongful conduct.&nbsp; It is the transgression of some established and definite rule of action, a forbidden act, a dereliction of duty, willful in character, and implies wrongful intent and not mere error in judgment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>To be considered grave misconduct, “the elements of corruption, clear intent to violate the law or flagrant disregard of established rule”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> must be present.<br><br>Justices Perez, Bersamin, and Reyes concur that the improprieties of Justice Ong were tantamount to misconduct.&nbsp; However, due to the absence of the element of corruption, the misconduct cannot be considered grave, hence, they merely penalized him for simple misconduct.<br><br><b><i>However, grave misconduct is not only qualified by corruption, it could also be qualified by violation of law or “flagrant disregard of established rule.”</i></b><br><br>Justice Ong violated the law by improperly receiving gifts from Napoles.&nbsp; In addition, he flagrantly disregarded established rules.<br><br>In <i>Imperial, Jr. v. Government Service Insurance System</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> this court described the instances when there is flagrant disregard of an established rule:<br><br><blockquote>Flagrant disregard of rules is a ground that jurisprudence has already touched upon.&nbsp; It has been demonstrated, among others, in the instances when there had been open defiance of a customary rule; in the repeated voluntary disregard of established rules in the procurement of supplies; in the practice of illegally collecting fees more than what is prescribed for delayed registration of marriages; when several violations or disregard of regulations governing the collection of government funds were committed; and when the employee arrogated unto herself responsibilities that were clearly beyond her given duties.&nbsp; <b>The common denominator in these cases was the employee’s propensity to ignore the rules as clearly manifested by his or her actions.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted)</blockquote><br>Justice Ong repeatedly ignored the Code of Judicial Conduct.&nbsp; His many years in the judiciary should have instilled in him the discipline to be cautious in his social life.&nbsp; Otherwise, he compromises his independence and impartiality.<br><br>Yet, Justice Ong repeatedly met and accepted favors from a former litigant.&nbsp; He offers no other explanation to characterize his relationship with Napoles.&nbsp; Certainly, his many acts of impropriety constitute grave misconduct.<br><br>Grave misconduct or gross misconduct constituting violations of the Code of Judicial Conduct under the Rules of Court, Rule 140, Section 8, is another serious charge.&nbsp; Again, the range of penalties for serious charges include dismissal, three- to six-month suspension, or a fine ranging from P20,000.00 to P40,000.00.<br><br>For Justice Ong’s series of improprieties, he deserves the penalty of DISMISSAL.<br><br>We meted the penalty of dismissal to a Regional Trial Court judge, Judge Marino Rubia, for similar improprieties.&nbsp; In <i>Sison-Barias v. Rubia,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> Judge Rubia and one of his court staff met with a litigant in a restaurant in the Bonifacio Global City.&nbsp; At that time, the litigant had three pending cases in Judge Rubia’s sala.&nbsp; During the meeting, Judge Rubia asked inappropriate questions relating to the personal circumstances of the litigant.&nbsp; The litigant was disturbed because Judge Rubia revealed that he was close to the opposing counsel, and he seemed to be using information about that litigant that he derived from the opposing counsel.&nbsp; The litigant felt that Judge Rubia was severely biased toward the opposing party.&nbsp; Judge Rubia convinced her to meet with opposing counsel to arrange her cases extra-judicially.&nbsp; For that meeting, Judge Rubia did not ask or receive favors from the litigant in exchange for a favorable decision, but the litigant paid the bill for the meals at the restaurant.&nbsp; After this incident, the litigant felt the bias against her in every order that Judge Rubia issued regarding her cases.<br><br>In Rubia, this court strictly enforced Canons 2, 3, and 4 of the Code of Judicial Conduct.&nbsp; To our mind, due to “[Judge Rubia’s] actions, complainant and all who will be made aware of the events of this case will harbor distrust toward the judiciary and its processes.”<br><br>Justice Ong should not be given a lighter penalty simply because he fraternized with a previous litigant, not a current litigant.&nbsp; The effect on his integrity, impartiality, and propriety is the same.&nbsp; He was a Sandiganbayan associate justice who was willing to compromise the integrity of the judiciary for favors.&nbsp; In that sense, Justice Ong’s transgressions are even graver than Judge Rubia’s.<br><br><center><b>IV<br>Proper penalty</b></center><br>The charge of grave misconduct constituting Justice Ong’s improprieties and his dishonesty is enough to justify the penalty of DISMISSAL.<br><br>In addition, Justice Ong already had a prior administrative sanction that aggravates his current standing in this administrative case.<br><br>In <i>Jamsani-Rodriguez v. Ong,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> this court already penalized Justice Ong for his misconduct.&nbsp; While the nature of Justice Ong’s offense was different, the finding of his administrative liability came with a warning that a repetition of the same or similar act shall be dealt with more severely.&nbsp; The fact that this court subsequently granted him judicial clemency<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> does not cure this warning.&nbsp; This warning persists.<br><br>The acts committed by Justice Ong in this case are more severe than in <i>Jamsani-Rodriguez v. Ong</i>.&nbsp; In <i>Jamsani-Rodriguez</i>, Justice Ong was found guilty of irregularly holding proceedings in court, violative of the collegial nature of the Sandiganbayan.&nbsp; In this case, his acts lacked integrity, were improper, and dishonest.<br><br><center>FINAL NOTE</center><br>The Code of Judicial Conduct requires “[j]udges [to] ensure that not only is their conduct above reproach, but that it is perceived to be so in the view of a reasonable observer.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup>&nbsp; A judge should ensure that his conduct, even out of court, maintains and enhances the confidence of the public in the impartiality of the judiciary.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup><br><br>The expectations of propriety are higher for Sandiganbayan justices like Justice Ong.&nbsp; It is the Sandiganbayan that has the primary exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide the most difficult cases involving graft and corruption.&nbsp; It is the Sandiganbayan that sits in judgement of public officers who violate the provisions of the Revised Penal Code, Republic Act No. 3019, Republic Act No. 6713, and Presidential Decree No. 46 on the receiving of gifts.&nbsp; It is the justices of the Sandiganbayan that struggle day in and day out against political pressure and personal risk to live by the public’s faith that they will themselves follow the law.<br><br>Many times during the deliberations of this case, colleagues have pointed to the need for compassion for the case of Justice Ong.&nbsp; We are told that he has served long years as a judge and as a justice.&nbsp; <b><i>We were even told that he attempted to informally circulate a letter through other colleagues in this court that he was willing to take optional retirement should he be meted with any kind of suspension.<br><br>That he had the audacity to try to influence the members of this court by offering to resign through an informal letter circulated through some colleagues is in my view could have been another basis for his dismissal.&nbsp; It shows that he has at least made attempts to communicate ex parte with members of this court outside the formal processes allowed by our rules.<br><br>Ex parte communication sub rosa by one being investigated with any member of this court while we sit in deliberation of his case is wrong.

I submit this Separate Opinion, however, to emphasize that the commission of acts of<i> Indirect Bribery</i> under Article 211 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) and <i>Acceptance of Gift</i> under Presidential Decree No. 46 (PD 46)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> are also punishable administratively. If proven on the facts by substantial evidence, they give rise to the sanctions of dismissal from the service and forfeiture of benefits as provided under Rule 140 of the Revised Rules of Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br><i>Laws governing practice of gift-giving&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i><br><br>A public officer should not accept any gift offered to him because such gift is offered in anticipation of future favor from him. Such gift received will in the future corrupt him or make him omit the performance of his official duty.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> As part of the government's efforts to wipe out all conceivable forms of graft and corruption in the public service, there are several laws in place that regulate the practice of gift-giving to public officials. For purposes of this case, PD 46 and Article 211 of the Revised Penal Code find relevance.<br><br>Thus, Presidential Decree No. 46 makes it "punishable for any public official or employee, whether of the national or local governments, to receive, directly or indirectly, and for private persons to give, or offer to give, <i>any gift, present or other valuable thing on any occasion,</i> including Christmas, when such gift, present or other valuable thing is given <i>by reason of his official position, regardless of whether or not</i> the same is for past favor or favors or the giver hopes or expects to receive a favor or better treatment in the future from the public official or employee concerned in the discharge of his official functions."<br><br>Violation of PD 46 shall be penalized by imprisonment of not less than one (1) year nor more than five (5) years and perpetual disqualification from office. The official or employee concerned shall likewise be subject to administrative disciplinary action and, "if found guilty, shall be meted out the penalty of suspension or removal, depending on the seriousness of the offense."<br><br>While PD 46 is not part of the enumeration in Section 8, Rule 140 of the Revised Rules of Court the commission of which gives rise to the sanction of dismissal from the service and forfeiture of benefits, PD 46 should be deemed included among these "serious charges." An examination of said Section would show that the enumeration is qualified by the word "include"--- which implies that the enumeration is not exclusive but would also cover acts analogous to those enumerated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> The acts of gift-giving and gift-receiving prohibited in PD 46 are analogous<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> to those same practices similarly prohibited under Article 211 of the RPC (<i>Indirect Bribery</i>) and Republic Act No. 3019, otherwise known as the Anti-Graft and CmTUpt Practices Act. The common element under PD 46 and Article 211 of the RPC is that both laws consider a public official's act of receiving a gift, given by reason of his official position, as corrupt.<br><br>PD 46 was issued by former President Ferdinand E. Marcos in 1972. To date, it has not been repealed nor its constitutionality duly questioned; it thus continues to be good law. In fact, PD 46 is included in the Revised Edition of the Compilation of Laws on Graft and Corruption issued by the Office of the Ombudsman in 2004. In his Commentary on Legal and Judicial Ethics, Agpalo identifies violation of PD 46 as among the other cnmes committed by public officers and included in the liability of judges.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Similarly, Article 211 of the RPC (<i>Indirect Bribery</i>) provides for a penalty to be imposed upon any public official who shall accept gifts offered to him <i>by reason of his office</i>. This Article was amended in 1985 to increase the penalty for the offense from <i>arresto mayor</i> to<i> prision correcional.</i><br><br>Significantly, under both PD 46 and Article 211 of the RPC, a public officer becomes liable upon mere acceptance of a gift. It is not necessary that the official should do any particular act or promise to do an act, as it is enough that he accepts gifts offered to him by reason of his office.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Neither is it required that the giver hopes or expects to receive a favor or better treatment in the future.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> That PD 46 and Article 211 is a variant of the other appears to be confirmed by Luis B. Reyes who, in his commentary on the Revised Penal Code, included PD 46 in his discussion of Article 211.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Republic Act No. 6713 (RA 6713), or the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees, defines a gift as "a thing or a right to dispose of gratuitously, or any act or liberality, in favor of another who accepts it. .."<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[11]</sup></font> RA 6713 further defines the act of "receiving any gift" to include "the act of accepting directly or indirectly, a gift from a person other than a member of his family or relative... even on the occasion of a family celebration or national festivity like Christmas, if the value of the gift is neither nominal nor insignificant, or the gift is given in anticipation of, or in exchange for, a favor.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Notably, the proscription against the solicitation and/or acceptance of gifts has been adopted by a number of government agencies as part of their official policy. The Governance Commission for Government-Owned and Controlled Corporations (GCG), under Section 29 of the Code of Corporate Governance for the GOCC Sector, required all covered Governing Boards to formally adopt a "No Gift Policy" and ensure its full advertisement to the community and its strict implementation by particular set of rules.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Thus, government-owned and controlled corporations (GOCCs) such as the Land Bank of the Philippines,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> the Philippine Postal Corporation,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> the Development Bank of the Philippines<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> and the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> have issued written policies to this effect.

Respondent did not deny these meetings but explained that these were mere gestures of appreciation on his part for Mrs. Napoles' invaluable assistance in securing him access to the robe of the Black Nazarene:<br><br><blockquote><center>xxx<br></center><br><blockquote>A: xxx And one thing that caught my attention was that she told me that Monsignor Ramirez is not only a Parish Priest of Quiapo Church but that he has with him the robe of the <i>Mahal na Poon </i>which is miraculous and has a healing power if you wear it.<br><br>Atty. Geronilla<br><br>Q: What was your reaction when Mrs.<br><br>Napoles told you about this? Justice Ong<br><br>A: I have a medical issue, but I did not tell her that. I have a medical issue and how I wished that I will get relief because of my faith and devotion to the <i>Mahal na Poon</i> called the Black Nazarene. <b><u>So, obviously, I was very interested and I asked that if I can have access to the robe of the Mahal na Poon</u></b>.<br><br><center>xxx</center><br>Q: Now what happened after this when you confirmed with Mrs. Napoles that there was such a robe of the Black Nazarene and you wanted to be draped or clothed or whatever? What happened next? What did you tell to Ms. Napoles?<br><br>A: <b><u>I want to have access to that robe so that I can wear it and then put it on my body, sir.</u></b><br><br>Q: <b><u>What happened next? What was the reaction of Mrs. Napoles when you told him about your wish?</u></b><br><br>A: <b><u>Mrs. Napoles readily acceded and she told me that she will arrange an audience with Monsignor Ramirez for me.</u></b><br><br>Q: And what happened next?<br><br>A: About the call of Mrs. Napoles on the cell, she told me if I know Sanctuario de San Antonio Church...<br><br>Q: How did she know your cell number<br><br>Justice Ong?<br><br>A: Did I not tell you that we exchanged cell numbers when I got interested when she mentioned about Monsignor Ramirez...<br><br>Atty.

She told me Monsignor Ramirez agreed, but do you know the Sanctuario de San Antonio Church in Makati?<br><br>Q: What was your answer?<br><br>A: I said I know the Santuario in Makati but definitely<i> sabi ko </i>I know the Adoracion Chapel at the back of the church. I don't go to Santuario. I went there only twice or thrice.<br><br>Q: So, what happened next after you told her that you know the Adoracion Chapel at the back of the Santuario de San Antonio Church?<br><br>A: She told me that I just park my car there and somebody will pick me up. That was a Sunday. When she arranged for a meeting, that was a Sunday, sir.<br><br>Q: After that, did you actually go to the<br><br>Adoracion Chapel?<br><br>A: Yes, sir. I went there and I was picked up by the driver and he brought me to... inside a subdivision. I really don't know if it is Forbes or Dasmarinas.<br><br>Q: What happened next?<br><br>A: I went inside the house, and it is a modest house, and at that time, a mass was about to take place.<br><br>Q: Who were in the house where the mass was about to take place, Justice?<br><br>A: Monsignor Ramirez and a number of Chinese priests and many Chinese guests inside the house.<br><br>Q: What happened next? What did you do there?<br><br>A: I attended the mass and then after the mass,<i> nahihiya po ako e</i>. I wanted to go home already but Janet Napoles said "No, I will introduce you." <i>Kasi ho</i> there were many Chinese and I did not want to be identified with them. So, I wanted to go home already because ever since if I may be allowed, your Honor, if I have a problem, the Chinese Federation, they cannot approach me. When I was in the RTC, there was someone who... I wanted to leave the premises but Janet Napoles said I have to introduce you to Monsignor Ramirez. So, I was introduced to Monsignor Ramirez and I was also introduced to the husband of Napoles. The husband was a good singer. He was playing the guitar during the mass.<br><br>Q: What is the name of the husband? <br><br>A: Jaime Napoles, sir.<br><br>Q: Do you know where that house is?<br><br>A: I do not know, sir, but that is the place where Monsignor Ramirez and the other priests were staying.<br><br>Q: Okay, according to Mrs. Janet Napoles, she wanted to introduce you to Monsignor Ramirez. Did she actually introduce you to him?<br><br>A: Yes, sir. I was introduced to Monsignor Ramirez and that was already about lunch time and after the mass, Monsignor Ramirez told me to stay for lunch.<br><br>Q: And who were with you in the lunch? <br><br>A: The husband and wife together with a number of Chinese guests seated in a long table.<br><br>Q: Do you remember where you were seated?<br><br>A: Yes, sir. Monsignor Ramirez is a very big guy, almost 400 lbs, I suppose. He is a very big guy so he was seated in the <i>kabisera</i> and I was seated to his right, and Mrs. Napoles was facing me. <b><u>I supposed Monsignor Ramirez already knew at that time that I wanted access to the robe. When I kissed his hand, he told me "<i>Hijo, bakit gusto mong masuot ang robe ng Mahal na Poon</i>?" Since he is a priest, I confided "<i>kasi ho may prostate cancer po ako e.</i>" and he said you just talk to Mrs. Napoles and arrange it and I will have you wear it. You just make arrangement with Ms. Napoles and you will know when and how you can wear that robe.</u></b><br><br>Q: <b><u>So did this actually happen, Justice Ong</u></b>?<br><br>A: <b><u>Yes, sir.</u></b><br><br>Q: Will you tell this Court the circumstances of this happening?<br><br>A: <b><u>After a week or more than that, a week or two, Mrs. Napoles told me to go to Quiapo Church early in the afternoon.

Geronilla<br><br>Q: <b><u>After this man gave you that piece of cotton or cotton balls, what happened next? What did you do, if any?</u></b><br><br>A: <b><u>After that, I decided to see Ms. Napoles, sir. I called her up. I decided to see her because this is a big thing for me.

No, 2012, your honor.<br><br>Q: Now, you were explaining earlier that your letter to the Chief Justice concentrated only on the photograph and article of Mr. Rufo and that at that time, there was no allegation regarding the fact that you visited or was seen in the office of Janet Napoles.

In fact, as provided under RA 6713, it can come in the form of a favor, an act or liberality extended in favor of another. Thus, in <i>Capuno vs. Jaramillo</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> a judge was found guilty of gross misconduct and dismissed from the service for having accepted the free use, for one year, of a car and availment of free battery recharging services from a litigant who has a pending case before him. In <i>Agpalasin vs. Agcaoili</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> a judge was dismissed for allowing a litigant in his sala to pay for the freight of his personal acquisitions.<br><br><i>Second.</i> The gift given to Respondent can hardly be considered of nominal or insignificant value. Respondent referred to the robe of the "<i>Mahal na Poon</i>" as "miraculous and has a healing power if you wear it."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; By Respondent's own estimation of his devotion, this gift is of immeasurable value to him as it is a gift of healing, more so in light of his medical condition. As Respondent testified, after he wore the robe, he was "so happy" and "spiritually refreshed because of his devotion."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>This Court may take judicial notice of the fact that ardent devotees of the Black Nazarene risk injury to life and limb for even just a simple touch of the icon's robe when it is paraded during the Black Nazarene's feast day in January. Needless to say, this gift of the ability to wear (and not merely to touch) the Black Nazarene's robe partakes of special treatment not made available to the rest of the faithful. It was, however, made especially available to Respondent. The same can be said of the gift of the fragrant cotton balls.<br><br>In addition, Respondent admitted that, after having worn the Black Nazarene's robe and received the fragrant cotton balls, he went to Mrs. Napoles' office on his own volition to thank her personally. Even after that, he was unable to decline Mrs. Napoles' invitations for him to visit her at her office. These only prove that Respondent deemed the gifts of such inestimable value that he needed to see Mrs. Napoles twice to personally thank her. Otherwise, as the Honorable Investigating Justice Angelina Sandoval-Gutienez said, Respondent could very well just have thanked Mrs. Napoles over the phone, as would be the polite way to do when one receives tokens of nominal value.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br><i>Finally</i>, the gift was extended to Respondent by reason of his office. Respondent is not a relative or family friend of Mrs. Napoles. Neither are they colleagues or employees of the same office. In fact, according to Respondent, they met only during the party of Senator Estrada.
