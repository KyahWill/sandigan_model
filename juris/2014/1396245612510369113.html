Hence, the posting of the Notice of Foreclosure in the places defined by the rules was sufficient.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup>&nbsp; Besides, respondent sheriff is presumed to have regularly performed his work.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>The Petition is meritorious.<br><br><i><b>The Real Estate Mortgage was entered<br>into by Concepcion in her own personal <br>capacity.</b></i><br><br>As early as the case of <i>Philippine Sugar Estates Development Co. v. Poizat,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> we already ruled that “in order to bind the principal by a deed executed by an agent, the deed must upon its face purport to be made, signed and sealed in the name of the principal.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup>&nbsp; In other words, the mere fact that the agent was authorized to mortgage the property is not sufficient to bind the principal, unless the deed was executed and signed by the agent for and on behalf of his principal. This ruling was adhered to and reiterated with consistency in the cases of <i>Rural Bank of Bombon (Camarines Sur), Inc. v. Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> <i>Gozun v. Mercado,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> and <i>Far East Bank and Trust Company (Now Bank of the Philippine Island) v. Cayetano.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>In <i>Philippine Sugar Estates Development Co.,</i> the wife authorized her husband to obtain a loan and to secure it with mortgage on her property.&nbsp; Unfortunately, although the real estate mortgage stated that it was executed by the husband in his capacity as attorney-in-fact of his wife, the husband signed the contract in his own name without indicating that he also signed it as the attorney-in-fact of his wife. <br><br>In <i>Rural Bank of Bombon,</i> the agent contracted a loan from the bank and executed a real estate mortgage.&nbsp; However, he did not indicate that he was acting on behalf of his principal. &nbsp;<br><br>In <i>Gozun,</i> the agent obtained a cash advance but signed the receipt in her name alone, without any indication that she was acting for and on behalf of her principal. <br><br>In <i>Far East Bank and Trust Company,</i> the mother executed an SPA authorizing her daughter to contract a loan from the bank and to mortgage her properties. The mortgage, however, was signed by the daughter and her husband as mortgagors in their individual capacities, without stating that the daughter was executing the mortgage for and on behalf of her mother.<br><br>Similarly, in this case, the authorized agent failed to indicate in the mortgage that she was acting for and on behalf of her principal.&nbsp; The Real Estate Mortgage, explicitly shows on its face, that it was signed by Concepcion in her own name and in her own personal capacity.&nbsp; In fact, there is nothing in the document to show that she was acting or signing as an agent of petitioner.&nbsp; Thus, consistent with the law on agency and established jurisprudence, petitioner cannot be bound by the acts of Concepcion.<br><br>In light of the foregoing, there is no need to delve on the issues of forgery of the SPA and the nullity of the foreclosure sale.&nbsp; For even if the SPA was valid,&nbsp; the Real Estate Mortgage would still not bind petitioner as it was signed by Concepcion in her personal capacity and not as an agent of petitioner.&nbsp; Simply put, the Real Estate Mortgage is void and unenforceable against petitioner.<br><br><i><b>Respondent bank was negligent. </b></i><br><br>At this point, we find it significant to mention that respondent bank has no one to blame but itself. Not only did it act with undue haste when it granted and released the loan in less than three days, it also acted negligently in preparing the Real Estate Mortgage as it failed to indicate that Concepcion was signing it for and on behalf of petitioner. We need not belabor that the words “as attorney-in-fact of,” “as agent of,” or “for and on behalf of,” are vital in order for the principal to be bound by the acts of his agent. Without these words, any mortgage, although signed by the agent, cannot bind the principal as it is considered to have been signed by the agent in his personal capacity.<br><br><i><b>Respondent bank is liable to pay<br>petitioner attorney’s fees, and the costs<br> of the suit.</b></i><br><br>Considering that petitioner was compelled to litigate or to incur expenses to protect her interest,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> the RTC was right when it ruled that respondent bank is liable to pay petitioner attorney’s fees in the amount of P20,000.00.&nbsp; However, we are not convinced that petitioner is entitled to an award of moral damages as it was not satisfactorily shown that respondent bank acted in bad faith or with malice.&nbsp; Neither was it proven that respondent bank’s acts were the proximate cause of petitioner’s wounded feelings.&nbsp; On the contrary, we note that petitioner is not entirely free of blame considering her negligence in entrusting her title to Concepcion.&nbsp; In any case, the RTC did not fully explain why petitioner is entitled to such award. &nbsp;<br><br><b><i>Concepcion is liable to pay respondent<br> bank her unpaid obligation and<br> reimburse it for all damages, attorney’s<br> fees and costs of suit.</i></b><br><br>Concepcion, on the other hand, is liable to pay respondent bank her unpaid obligation under the Promissory Note dated June 11, 1982, with interest.&nbsp; As we have said, Concepcion signed the Promissory Note in her own personal capacity; thus, she cannot escape liability.&nbsp; She is also liable to reimburse respondent bank for all damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs the latter is adjudged to pay petitioner in this case. <br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the Petition is hereby <b>GRANTED.</b> The assailed August 17, 2005 Decision and the June 7, 2007 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
