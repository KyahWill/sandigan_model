				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Before the Court are 10 consolidated Petitions, the issue at the crux of which is the constitutionality and/or validity of Section 21(B) of Ordinance No. 7794 of the City of Manila, otherwise known as the Revenue Code of the City of Manila (Manila Revenue Code), as amended by Ordinance No. 7807.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br><center><b>I<br>ANTECEDENT FACTS</b><br></center><br>The Manila Revenue Code was enacted on June 22, 1993 by the City Council of Manila and approved on June 29, 1993 by then Manila Mayor Alfredo S. Lim (Lim).&nbsp; Section 21(B) of said Code originally provided:<br><br><blockquote>Section 21.&nbsp; <u>Tax on Businesses Subject to the Excise, Value-Added or Percentage Taxes Under the NIRC</u>. – On any of the following businesses and articles of commerce subject to the excise, value-added or percentage taxes under the National Internal Revenue Code, hereinafter referred to as NIRC, as amended, a tax of three percent (3%) per annum on the gross sales or receipts of the preceding calendar year is hereby imposed:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>B)&nbsp; On the gross receipts of keepers of garages, cars for rent or hire driven by the lessee, transportation contractors, persons who transport passenger or freight for hire, and common carriers by land, air or water, except owners of bancas and owners of animal-drawn two-wheel vehicle.<br></blockquote><br>Shortly thereafter, Ordinance No. 7807 was enacted by the City Council of Manila on September 27, 1993 and approved by Mayor Lim on September 29, 1993, already amending several provisions of the Manila Revenue Code.&nbsp; Section 21 of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, imposed a lower tax rate on the businesses that fell under it, and paragraph (B) thereof read as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Section 21.&nbsp; <u>Tax on Business Subject to the Excise, Value-Added or Percentage Taxes Under the NIRC</u> –&nbsp; On any of the following businesses and articles of commerce subject to the excise, value-added or percentage taxes under the National Internal Revenue Code hereinafter referred to as NIRC, as amended, a tax of FIFTY PERCENT (50%) OF ONE PERCENT (1%) per annum on the gross sales or receipts of the preceding calendar year is hereby imposed:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>B)&nbsp; On the gross receipts of keepers of garages, cars for rent or hire driven by the lessee, transportation contractors, persons who transport passenger or freight for hire, and common carriers by land, air or water, except owners of bancas and owners of animal-drawn two-wheel vehicle.</blockquote><br>The City of Manila, through its City Treasurer, began imposing and collecting the business tax under Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, beginning January 1994.<br><br><b><i><u>G.R. No. 120051</u></i></b><br><br>Malaysian Airline System (MAS) is a foreign corporation organized and existing under the laws of Malaysia.&nbsp; It is licensed to engage in business in the Philippines by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), particularly in the airline business which involves the transportation of passengers and cargo for hire.&nbsp; Its principal office and place of business in the Philippines is located in the City of Manila.<br><br>As MAS was renewing its business permit for 1994, it was assessed by the City Treasurer of Manila on January 17, 1994 for the following taxes and fees:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="50%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Mayor’s permit and regulatory fees</div></td> <td width="30%"><div align="RIGHT">P &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 10,307.50</div></td> <td width="20%">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Municipal license tax or business tax</div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT"><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1,100,000.00</u></div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Total</div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">P 1,110,307.50<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>MAS, believing that it was exempt from the municipal license tax or business tax, tendered, via Far East Bank and Trust Company (FEBTC) Check No. 06564 dated January 19, 1994, only the amount of P10,307.50 for the mayor’s permit and regulatory fees.&nbsp; The City Treasurer of Manila refused to accept FEBTC Check No. 06564.<br><br>Consequently, on January 20, 1994, MAS instituted Civil Case No. 94-69052, to consign with the trial court the amount of P10,307.50 for mayor’s permit and regulatory fees; to challenge the assessment against it by the City Treasurer of Manila in the amount of P1,100,000.00 for municipal license tax or business tax; and to have Section&nbsp; 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, on which said assessment for municipal license tax or business tax was based, be declared invalid or null and void.&nbsp; Civil Case No.&nbsp; 94-69052 was assigned to the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila, Branch 43.<br><br>On April 3, 1995, RTC-Branch 43 rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> in favor of MAS.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of said Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the foregoing disquisitions considered, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiff against the defendants:<br><blockquote><ol><li>Declaring the consignation valid and made in accordance with law;<br><br></li><li>Ordering defendants to issue to plaintiff the mayor’s permit or permit to operate for 1994, the necessary certificates and official receipts evidencing payment of [plaintiff’s] liabilities for mayor’s permit fee and other regulatory fees for 1994; and,<br><br></li><li>Declaring Section 21(B) of Ordinance No. 7794, as amended by Ordinance No. 7807, of the City of Manila as invalid or null and void insofar as it imposes a business tax on transportation contractors, persons engaged in the transportation of passengers or freight by hire and common carriers by air, land or water, or that plaintiff is exempt from the tax imposed by said section 21(B).<br><br></li><li>Declaring plaintiff’s obligation to the defendant City of Manila for mayor’s permit fee and other regulatory fees for 1994 as having been paid and extinguished without any liability for surcharges, interests or any additional amount whatsoever.</li></ol></blockquote>Not having been proven, the prayer for the payment of attorney’s fees is denied.<br><br>No pronouncement as to costs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The City of Manila, Mayor Lim, and City Treasurer Anthony Y.

That the trial court erred in declaring Section 21(B) of [the Manila Revenue Code, as amended,] as invalid or null and void.<br><br>4.2. That the trial court erred in declaring the consignation valid and made in accordance with law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The City of Manila, Mayor Lim, and City Treasurer Acevedo prayed in their Petition that the Court (1) reverse and set aside the assailed RTC Decision; and (2) affirm the constitutionality and validity of Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended.&nbsp; The Petition was docketed as G.R. No. 120051.<br><br>MAS filed its Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> to which the City of Manila, Mayor Lim, and City Treasurer Acevedo filed their Reply.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br><b><i><u>G.R.

(Gothong Lines); Aboitiz Shipping Corp., Aboitiz Air Transport Corp., and Aboitiz Haulers, Inc. (collectively referred to as the Aboitiz Group); Solid Shipping Lines Corp. (Solid Shipping); and PNOC Shipping &amp; Transport Corp. (PSTC).<br><br>Petitioner and intervenor corporations essentially sought the (1) declaration of Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, as void/invalid for being contrary to the Constitution and the Local Government Code (LGC) of 1991; (2) refund of the business taxes that the petitioner and intervenor corporations paid under protest; and (3) the issuance of a temporary restraining order (TRO), writ of preliminary injunction, writ of prohibition, and/or writ of permanent injunction to enjoin the implementation of Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended.<br><br>RTC-Branch 32 issued a TRO<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> on January 14, 1994 in favor of petitioners Maersk, APL, Flagship Tankers, CIMC, and CMC.&nbsp; The TRO was effective for 20 days and ordered respondent City of Manila and local officials to cease and desist from implementing Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, while the prayer for a writ of preliminary injunction was scheduled for presentation of evidence.&nbsp; On February 3, 1992, after hearing, RTC-Branch 32 issued an Order granting the prayer of petitioners Maersk, APL, Flagship Tankers, CIMC, CMC, and OFSI for the issuance of a Writ of Preliminary Injunction,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> with the condition that each of said petitioner corporations should post an injunction bond in the amount of P50,000.00.&nbsp; The Writ of Preliminary Injunction enjoined respondent City of Manila and local officials from: (1) imposing, enforcing, assessing, and collecting the taxes under Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended; and (2) denying to petitioners Maersk, APL, Flagship Tankers, CIMC, CMC, and OFSI their business permits and licenses for 1994.&nbsp; In another Order dated April 22, 1994, RTC-Branch 32 granted the prayer of intervenor corporations for the issuance of a similar Writ of Preliminary Injunction.<br><br>In its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> dated August 28, 1995 in Civil Case Nos. 94-68861, 94-68862, 94-68863, 94-68919, 94-68936, 94-68939, 94-68940, 94-68941, and 94-69028, RTC-Branch 32 upheld the power of the respondent City of Manila, as a local government unit (LGU), to levy the business tax under Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, consistent with the basic policy of local autonomy.&nbsp; Ultimately, RTC-Branch 32 decreed:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the petitions, the supplemental petitions, and the petitions or complaints in intervention in all these cases are DISMISSED.<br><br>All temporary restraining orders are cancelled, all writs of preliminary injunction are recalled and dissolved, and the injunction bonds cancelled.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></blockquote><br>Maersk, APL, Flagship Tankers, CIMC, and CMC (collectively referred to herein as Maersk, <i><i>et al.,</i></i>), filed a direct appeal before the Court.&nbsp; Initially, Maersk, <i>et al.,</i>, filed a motion for extension of time to file their petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>.&nbsp; Upon filing of said motion, they were assessed docket and legal fees in the amount of P420.00, which they fully paid.&nbsp; The motion for extension of time was granted by the Court in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> dated October 4, 1995.&nbsp; Within the extended period, Maersk, <i>et al.,</i>, filed their Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> with prayer for issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction and TRO,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> docketed as G.R. No. 121613, naming RTC-Branch 32, the City of Manila, Mayor Lim, Vice Mayor Atienza, the Sangguniang Panlungsod ng Maynila, and City Treasurer Acevedo, as respondents.&nbsp; Maersk, <i><i>et al.,</i>,</i> submitted for resolution by the Court a lone question of law, <i>viz</i>.:<br><br><blockquote>Whether or not Section 21(B) of Ordinance No. 7794, otherwise known as the Revenue Code of the City of Manila, as amended by Section 1(G) of Ordinance No. 7807, is valid and constitutional.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Meanwhile, Maersk, <i><i>et al.,</i></i>, also filed with RTC-Branch 32 a Motion to Stay or Restore Writ of Preliminary Injunction, presenting a Memorandum issued by City Treasurer Acevedo already ordering the collection of the business tax under Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended.&nbsp; In an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> dated October 16, 1995, RTC-Branch 32 granted the Motion of Maersk, <i>et al.,</i>, after finding the same to be meritorious and in conformity with Rule 39, Section 4 of the Rules of Court, on the condition that Maersk, <i><i>et al.,</i>, </i>would increase their injunction bond from P50,000.00 each to P800,000.00 each, or for a total of P4,000,000.00.&nbsp; With this latest development, Maersk, <i>et al.,</i>, filed with the Court a Supplemental Petition and Motion praying for the confirmation of the RTC Order dated October 16, 1995 restoring the Writ of Preliminary Injunction and deletion of the name of RTC-Branch 32 from the caption of the Petition in G.R. No. 121613 as the trial court is not a necessary party.<br><br>On October 23, 1995 though, the Court issued a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> in G.R. No. 121613 in which it resolved as follows:<br><br><blockquote>On the basis of the foregoing, the Court RESOLVED to DISMISS the petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> for non-compliance with the above-mentioned requirement no. 1, [Maersk, <i>et al.,</i>,] having failed to remit the amount of P202.00 as payment for the balance of the prescribed legal fees.<br><br>Accordingly, the supplemental petition and motion of [Maersk, <i>et al.,</i>.,] dated October 17, 1995 praying that the lower court’s order restoring the Writ of Preliminary Injunction be confirmed and that the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 32, be deleted from the caption of the petition for not being a necessary party is NOTED WITHOUT ACTION.<br></blockquote><br>Maersk, <i>et al.,</i>, filed a Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> of the foregoing Resolution dated October 23, 1995 of the Court.&nbsp; Maersk, <i>et al.,</i>, argued that the dismissal of their Petition by minute resolution would deprive them of their property rights on mere technical grounds.&nbsp; Maersk, <i>et al.,</i>, had no intention of not paying the amount of P202.00, which consisted of sheriff’s fee of P200.00 and clerk’s commission of P2.00, charged in connection with their prayer for the issuance of a preliminary injunction and TRO.&nbsp; While Maersk, <i>et al.,</i>, did include such a prayer in their Petition, the same had already become moot and academic after RTC-Branch 32 issued the Order dated October 16, 1995 restoring and reinstating the Writ of Preliminary Injunction in favor of Maersk,<i> et al.,</i>&nbsp; In their Supplemental Petition and Motion in G.R. No. 121613, Maersk, <i>et al.,</i>, was then only seeking the confirmation by the Court of the Order dated October 16, 1995 of RTC-Branch 32 and, in effect, withdrawing their prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction and TRO by the Court.&nbsp; Besides, Maersk, <i>et al.,</i>, submitted that the sheriff’s fee of P200.00 and clerk’s commission of P2.00 were not part of the “legal fees” required for perfecting an appeal from the decision of the Court of Appeals or the RTC.&nbsp; The sheriff’s fee and clerk’s commission would merely be “deposited” with the Court, which implied that said amounts would be “refunded” to Maersk, <i>et al.,</i>, in case the Court decided not to issue the TRO prayed for.&nbsp; In fact, when Maersk, <i>et al.,</i>, filed their motion for extension of time to file their petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>, they fully paid the docket and legal fees as computed by the cashier of the Court; and when they actually filed their Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> with prayer for issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction and TRO, they were not assessed and required to pay additional legal fees.&nbsp; In any event, Maersk, <i>et al.,</i>, had already deposited with the Cashier’s Office of the Court the amount of P202.00.&nbsp; Maersk, <i>et al.,</i>, asserted that their case is meritorious and that dismissal is discretionary for the appellate court and discretion must be exercised wisely and prudently, never capriciously, with a view to substantial justice.&nbsp; Consequently, Maersk, <i>et al.,</i>, prayed that the Court reconsider its Resolution dated October 23, 1995 and give due course to and squarely resolve their Petition and Supplemental Petition and Motion in G.R. No. 121613.<br><br>Counsel for Maersk, <i>et al.,</i>, subsequently submitted a joint Memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> for the petitioners in G.R. Nos. 121613, 122333, and 122349.<br><br><b><i><u>G.R.

SP No. 39188, adopted the same position.<br><br>The 1987 Constitution granted LGUs the power to create their own sources of revenue and to levy taxes, fees, and charges subject to the guidelines and limitations provided by Congress, consistent with the policy of local autonomy.&nbsp; This grant was reiterated in Section 129 of the LGC and the scope of tax powers of a city such as Manila is described in Section 151 also of the LGC.&nbsp; Hence, the Constitution and Congress, through the LGC, expressly granted LGUs the general power to tax.<br><br>The enactment of Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, is statutorily ingrained.&nbsp; It is based on the exempting clause at the beginning of Section 133, in conjunction with Section 143(h), of the LGC.&nbsp; The relevant provisions of the Code are reproduced below:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 133.<i>&nbsp; Common Limitations on the Taxing Powers of Local Government Units. </i>– <b>Unless otherwise provided herein</b>, the exercise of the taxing powers of provinces, cities, municipalities, and barangays shall not extend to the levy of the following:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(j) Taxes on the gross receipts of transportation contractors and persons engaged in the transportation of passengers or freight by hire and common carriers by air, land or water, except as provided in this Code;<br><br>SEC. 143. <i>Tax on Business</i>. – The municipality may impose taxes on the following businesses:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(h)<b> On any business, not otherwise specified in the preceding paragraphs</b>, which the sanggunian concerned may deem proper to tax:<i> Provided</i>, That<b> on any business subject to the excise, value-added or percentage tax under the National Internal Revenue Code, as amended</b>, the rate of tax shall not exceed two percent (2%) of gross sales or receipts of the preceding calendar year.<br><br>The sanggunian concerned may prescribe a schedule of graduated tax rates but in no case to exceed the rates prescribed herein. (Emphases supplied.)</blockquote><br>Inasmuch as “transportation contractors, persons who transport passenger or freight for hire, and common carriers by land, air or water,” are engaged in business subject to excise, value added, or percentage tax under the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC), as amended, then the City of Manila could lawfully levy local business tax under Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended.&nbsp; It is irrelevant which of Sections 133(j) and 143(h) of the LGC is the special or general provision since there is an exempting clause in Section 133, that is, “Unless otherwise provided herein,” which means that even if the businesses enumerated therein are exempted from the levy of local tax, if there is a provision to the contrary, such as Section 143(h), the Sanggunian concerned could still impose the local tax.&nbsp; As an alternative argument, Section 133(j) of the LGC is the general provision on the limitations on the taxing power of the LGUs, while Section 143(h) of the LGC is the specific provision on the businesses which the LGUs could tax; and per the rules of statutory construction, the latter prevails over the former.&nbsp; To rule otherwise and adopt the construction put forward by the opposing parties would render Section 143(h) of the LGC a hollow decorative provision with no subject to tax.<br><br>Moreover, the business tax imposed by Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, complied with the limitations and conditions in the LGC for a valid local tax:&nbsp; (1) The rate of tax did not exceed 2% of gross sales or receipts of the preceding calendar year; (2) The tax is consistent with the basic policy of local autonomy; (3) The tax is not unjust, excessive, oppressive, confiscatory, or contrary to declared national policy; and (4) That a prior public hearing was conducted for the purpose of enacting the Manila Revenue Code, as amended.<br><br>Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, also enjoyed the presumption of constitutionality and validity.&nbsp; This presumption can only be overridden by overwhelming evidence to the contrary.&nbsp; In <i>Drilon v.

For business tax, there is no set ratio between volume of sales and the amount of tax.&nbsp; Cities and municipalities are given the power to impose business tax under Section 143(h) of the LGC.&nbsp; In contrast, percentage or sales tax is based on gross sales or receipts.&nbsp; The percentage bears a direct relationship to the sales or receipts generated by a business, without regard for the extent of operation or size of the business.&nbsp; Cities and municipalities may validly impose a tax on business, but consonant with the limitations on local taxation, they may not impose percentage or sales tax on top of what is already imposed in the NIRC.&nbsp; Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, imposing on “transportation contractors, persons who transport passenger or freight for hire, and common carriers by land, air or water,” a tax of 50% of 1% of the gross sales or receipts from the preceding year on top of the national taxes already imposed by the NIRC was unjust, unfair, excessive, confiscatory, and in restraint of economic trade.<br><br>And finally, Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, violated the rule on uniformity in taxation.&nbsp; Uniformity in taxation should not be construed in a pure geographical sense,<i> i.e.</i>, that the questioned tax was imposed with the same force and effect on all businesses located in Manila.&nbsp; Shipping companies should be differentiated from other businesses.&nbsp; Aside from the risks and responsibilities the shipping companies shoulder, their services are not confined within the territorial limits of Manila alone but extend to other parts of the world.&nbsp; It is not uniformity for the shipping companies to be classed and taxed under the same category with other common carriers domiciled and plying Manila territory 24 hours a day.<br><br><b><center>III<br>RULING OF THE COURT<br></center></b><br><b><i>Resolution of pending incidents in <br>several cases.</i></b><br><br>Before delving into the merits of the 10 cases, there are pending incidents in three cases that first need to be addressed:<br><br>(1) <b><i>G.R.

No. 120051, filed a Manifestation and Motion for Leave to Withdraw Petition in G.R. No. 120051, on the ground that the issues therein had been rendered moot and academic by the Decisions of the Court in the <i>Coca-Cola cases,</i> which declared with finality the unconstitutionality of Section 21 of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended.<br><br>The Court resolves to deny the motion to withdraw.<br><br>There already had been an exchange of pleadings between the parties in G.R.

No. 120051 and all the other nine consolidated cases submitted for deliberation.&nbsp; At this stage, the decision to grant or not to grant the motion to withdraw is fully within the discretion of the Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>The Court denies the motion to withdraw because the assertion by the City Legal Officer of Manila that the <i>Coca-Cola cases</i> already rendered the issues in G.R. No. 120051 moot and academic is erroneous.&nbsp; The Court did not declare in the <i>Coca-Cola cases </i>that Section 21 of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, was unconstitutional.&nbsp; What the Court held in the two <i>Coca-Cola cases</i> was that Ordinance Nos. 7988 and 8011 (approved by then Mayor Atienza on February 25, 2000 and February 22, 2001, respectively), amending Section 21 of the Manila Revenue Code, were null and void for (a) failure to comply with the publication requirement for tax ordinances under Section 188 of the LGC; and (b) deletion of an exempting proviso found in Section 143(h) of the LGC and the prior Section 21 of the Manila Revenue Code, which opened the door to the double taxation of Coca-Cola.&nbsp; Section 21 of the Manila Revenue Code, as it was amended by Ordinance No. 7807, and more specifically, paragraph (B) thereof, was not the subject of a constitutional review by the Court in the<i> Coca-Cola cases.</i><br><br>As for Atty. Dela Cruz’s Compliance with the Court’s Show Cause Resolution, the Court finds the same satisfactory, although he is reminded to be more conscientious of his duties as legal counsel in the future, despite the heavy volume of his work load.<br><br>(2) <b><i>G.R. No. 121613</i></b>:&nbsp; In a Resolution dated October 23, 1995, the Court dismissed the Petition of Maersk, <i>et al.,</i>, for the latter’s failure to deposit sheriff’s fee and clerk’s commission in the total amount of P202.00; and in light of said dismissal, noted without action the Supplemental Petition and Motion of Maersk, <i>et al.,</i>, praying for the confirmation of the Writ of Preliminary Injunction restored by RTC-Branch 32 and deletion of RTC-Branch 32 from the caption of G.R. No. 121613 for not being a necessary party.&nbsp; In their pending Motion for Reconsideration of the Resolution dated October 23, 1995, Maersk, <i>et al.,</i>, prayed that the Court give due course to and squarely resolve their Petition and Supplemental Petition and Motion.<br><br>The Court resolves to grant the Motion for Reconsideration of Maersk, <i>et al.,</i>&nbsp; It sets aside the Resolution dated October 23, 1995; reinstates the Petition of Maersk, <i>et al.,</i>, in G.R. No. 121613; and gives due course to the Petition and Supplemental Petition and Motion of Maersk, <i>et al.,</i>, in the said case.<br><br>Of particular relevance to the plight of Maersk, <i>et al.,</i>, herein is the following discussion of the Court in <i>Ayala Land, Inc. v. Carpo</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup>:<br><br><blockquote>To be sure, the remedy of appeal is a purely statutory right and one who seeks to avail thereof must comply with the statute or rule.&nbsp; For this reason, payment of the full amount of the appellate court docket and other lawful fees within the reglementary period is mandatory and jurisdictional. However, as we have ruled in <i>Aranas v. Endona</i>, the strict application of the jurisdictional nature of the above rule on payment of appellate docket fees may be mitigated under exceptional circumstances to better serve the interest of justice.&nbsp; As early as 1946, in the case of <i>Segovia v. Barrios</i>, we ruled that where an appellant in good faith paid less than the correct amount for the docket fee because that was the amount he was required to pay by the clerk of court, and he promptly paid the balance, it is error to dismiss his appeal because –<br><blockquote>every citizen has the right to assume and trust that a public officer charged by law with certain duties knows his duties and performs them in accordance with law. <i>To penalize such citizen for relying upon said officer in all good faith is repugnant to justice.</i><br></blockquote>The ruling in<i> Segovia</i> was applied by this Court in subsequent cases where an appellant’s right to appeal was threatened by the mistake of public officers in computing the correct amount of docket fee. Respondents draw attention to Rule 41, §4 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure which provides that the appellate court docket and other lawful fees must be paid in full to the clerk of the court which rendered the judgment or final order appealed from within the period for taking the appeal.&nbsp; They argue that this Rule has overruled the decision in Segovia.<br><br>This contention is untenable. Rule 41, §4 must be read in relation to Rule 50, §1(c) which provides that:<br><blockquote>An appeal may be dismissed by the Court of Appeals, on its own motion or on that of the appellee, on the following grounds:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(c)&nbsp; Failure of the appellant to pay the docket and other lawful fees as provided in Section 4 of Rule 41.<br><br>x x x x<br></blockquote>With the exception of §1(b), which refers to the failure to file notice of appeal or the record on appeal within the period prescribed by these Rules, the grounds enumerated in Rule 50, §1 are merely directory and not mandatory. This is plain from the use of the permissive “may” in the text of the statute. Despite the jurisdictional nature of the rule on payment of docket fee, therefore, the appellate court still has the discretion to relax the rule in meritorious cases. The ruling in Segovia is still good law which the appellate court, in the exercise of its discretion, must apply in circumstances such as that in the present case where an appellant was, from the start, ready and willing to pay the correct amount of docket fee, but was unable to do so due to the error of an officer of the court in computing the correct amount. To hold otherwise would be unjust and unwarranted. (Citations omitted.)</blockquote><br>The Court notes that Revised Circular No. 1-88, effective July 1, 1991, which was cited in the Resolution dated October 23, 1995 as basis for the dismissal of the Petition of Maersk, <i>et al.,</i>, also used the word “may” in the first paragraph thereof:<br><br><blockquote>(1) <i>Payment of docketing and other fees. </i>– Section 1 of Rule 45 requires that petitions for review be filed and the required fees paid within the prescribed period. Unless exempted by law or rule, such fees must be fully paid in accordance with this Circular; otherwise, the Court may deny the petition outright. The same rule shall govern petitions under Rule 65.

No. 122335 from the Court of Appeals back to the Court.<br><br>The Court resolves to grant the Motion for Reconsideration of Sulpicio Lines.&nbsp; It sets aside the Resolution dated January 31, 1996 and gives due course to the Petition of Sulpicio Lines in G.R. No. 122335.<br><br>The Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari </i>of Sulpicio Lines, filed under Rule 42 of the old Rules of Court, should not have been referred to the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; It is true that under Section 9, paragraph (3) of Batas Pambansa Blg. 129, the Court of Appeals has “(e)xclusive appellate jurisdiction over all final judgments, resolutions, orders or awards of Regional Trial Courts x x x.” However,&nbsp; Rule&nbsp; 42&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; old&nbsp; Rules&nbsp; of&nbsp; Court,&nbsp; then in effect, allowed an appeal straight from the RTC (formerly called Court of First Instance) to the Supreme Court when the appeal raised pure questions of law:<br><br><blockquote><center>RULE 42<br>APPEAL FROM COURTS OF FIRST INSTANCE<br>TO SUPREME COURT<br></center><br>Section 1. <i>Procedure</i>. – The procedure of appeal to the Supreme Court from Courts of First Instance shall be governed by the same rules governing appeals to the Court of Appeals, except as hereinafter provided.<br><br>Section 2. <i>Appeals on pure question of law.</i> – Where the appellant states in his notice of appeal or record on appeal that he will raise only questions of law, no other question shall be allowed, and the evidence need not be elevated.</blockquote><br>A cursory reading of the Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> of Sulpicio Lines would readily reveal that it appealed the Decision dated August 28, 1995 of RTC-Branch 32 in Civil Case Nos. 94-68861, 94-68862, 94-68863, 94-68919, 94-68936, 94-68939, 94-68940, 94-68941, and 94-69028 based only on questions of law.&nbsp; The Petition did not raise any question of fact and did not require the presentation or elevation of evidence.<br><br>In G.R. No. 124855, Dongnama and Kyowa questioned the Resolution dated October 23, 1995, which similarly referred their original Petition for <i>Certiorari,</i> docketed as G.R. No. 122120, to the Court of Appeals, where it was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 39188.&nbsp; The Resolution dated October 23, 1995 cited as basis for the referral Section 9, paragraph (1) of Batas Pambansa Blg. 129 which gave the Court of Appeals “[o]riginal jurisdiction to issue writs of <i>mandamus,</i> prohibition, <i>certiorari, habeas corpus,</i> and <i>quo warranto, </i>and auxiliary writs or processes, whether or not in aid of its appellate jurisdiction.”&nbsp; The Court, however, will no longer address the propriety of the referral of the original Petition of Dongnama and Kyowa to the Court of Appeals since said issue has become moot and academic after the appellate court rendered its Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 39188 on March 29, 1996.&nbsp; The Court will simply treat the Petition in G.R. No. 124855 as an appeal of the Decision dated March 29, 1996 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 39188.<br><br><b><i>Ruling on the merits of the 10 Petitions.&nbsp; </i></b><br><br>The Court rules in favor of MAS; Maersk, <i>et al.,</i>; Eastern Shipping; William Lines, <i>et al.,</i>; PSTC; OFSI; Cosco, <i>et al.,</i>; Sulpicio Lines; AISL; and Dongnama and Kyowa.&nbsp; Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, was null and void for being beyond the power of the City of Manila and its public officials to enact, approve, and implement under the LGC.<br><br>It is already well-settled that although the power to tax is inherent in the State, the same is not true for the LGUs to whom the power must be delegated by Congress and must be exercised within the guidelines and limitations that Congress may provide.&nbsp; The Court expounded in <i>Pelizloy Realty Corporation v. The Province of Benguet</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> that:<br><br><blockquote>The power to tax “is an attribute of sovereignty,” and as such, inheres in the State. Such, however, is not true for provinces, cities, municipalities and barangays as they are not the sovereign; rather, they are mere “territorial and political subdivisions of the Republic of the Philippines”.<br><br>The rule governing the taxing power of provinces, cities, municipalities and <i>barangays</i> is summarized in <i>Icard v. City Council of Baguio</i>:<br><blockquote>It is settled that a municipal corporation unlike a sovereign state is clothed with no inherent power of taxation.&nbsp; <u>The charter or statute must plainly show an intent to confer that power or the municipality, cannot assume it</u>. And the power when granted is to be construed in strictissimi juris.&nbsp; Any doubt or ambiguity arising out of the term used in granting that power must be resolved against the municipality.&nbsp; Inferences, implications, deductions – all these – have no place in the interpretation of the taxing power of a municipal corporation.</blockquote>Therefore, the power of a province to tax is limited to the extent that such power is delegated to it either by the Constitution or by statute. Section 5, Article X of the 1987 Constitution is clear on this point:<br><blockquote>Section 5.&nbsp; Each local government unit shall have the power to create its own sources of revenues and to levy taxes, fees and charges subject to such guidelines and limitations as the Congress may provide, consistent with the basic policy of local autonomy. Such taxes, fees, and charges shall accrue exclusively to the local governments.</blockquote>Per Section 5, Article X of the 1987 Constitution, “the power to tax is no longer vested exclusively on Congress; local legislative bodies are now given direct authority to levy taxes, fees and other charges.” Nevertheless, such authority is “subject to such guidelines and limitations as the Congress may provide”.<br><br>In conformity with Section 3, Article X of the 1987 Constitution, Congress enacted Republic Act No. 7160, otherwise known as the Local Government Code of 1991. Book II of the LGC governs local taxation and fiscal matters.<br><br>Relevant provisions of Book II of the LGC establish the parameters of the taxing powers of LGUs found below.<br><br><i>First,</i> Section 130 provides for the following fundamental principles governing the taxing powers of LGUs:<br><br><ol><li>Taxation shall be uniform in each LGU.<br><br></li><li>Taxes, fees, charges and other impositions shall:<br><br><ol type="a"><li>be equitable and based as far as practicable on the taxpayer’s ability to pay;<br><br></li><li>be levied and collected only for public purposes;<br><br></li><li>not be unjust, excessive, oppressive, or confiscatory;<br><br></li><li>not be contrary to law, public policy, national economic policy, or in the restraint of trade.<br></li></ol><br></li><li>The collection of local taxes, fees, charges and other impositions shall in no case be let to any private person.<br><br></li><li>The revenue collected pursuant to the provisions of the LGC shall inure solely to the benefit of, and be subject to the disposition by, the LGU levying the tax, fee, charge or other imposition unless otherwise specifically provided by the LGC.<br><br></li><li> Each LGU shall, as far as practicable, evolve a progressive system of taxation.</li></ol><br>Second, Section 133 provides for the common limitations on the taxing powers of LGUs. x x x. (Underscoring and citations omitted.)</blockquote><br>Among the common limitations on the taxing power of LGUs is Section 133(j) of the LGC, which states that “[u]nless otherwise provided herein,” the taxing power of LGUs shall not extend to “[t]axes on the gross receipts of transportation contractors and persons engaged in the transportation of passengers or freight by hire and common carriers by air, land or water, except as provided in this Code[.]”<br><br>Section 133(j) of the LGC clearly and unambiguously proscribes LGUs from imposing any tax on the gross receipts of transportation contractors, persons engaged in the transportation of passengers or freight by hire, and common carriers by air, land, or water.&nbsp; Yet, confusion arose from the phrase “unless otherwise provided herein,” found at the beginning of the said provision.&nbsp; The City of Manila and its public officials insisted that said clause recognized the power of the municipality or city, under Section 143(h) of the LGC, to impose tax “on any business subject to the excise, value-added or percentage tax under the National Internal Revenue Code, as amended.”&nbsp; And it was pursuant to Section 143(h) of the LGC that the City of Manila and its public officials enacted, approved, and implemented Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended.<br><br>The Court is not convinced.&nbsp; Section 133(j) of the LGC prevails over Section 143(h) of the same Code, and Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, was manifestly in contravention of the former.<br><br><i>First</i>, Section 133(j) of the LGC is a specific provision that explicitly withholds from any LGU, <i>i.e.,</i> whether the province, city, municipality, or <i>barangay, </i>the power to tax the gross receipts of transportation contractors, persons engaged in the transportation of passengers or freight by hire, and common carriers by air, land, or water.<br><br>In contrast, Section 143 of the LGC defines the general power of the municipality (as well as the city, if read in relation to Section 151<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> of the same Code) to tax businesses within its jurisdiction.&nbsp; While paragraphs (a) to (g) thereof identify the particular businesses and fix the imposable tax rates for each, paragraph (h) is apparently the “catch-all provision” allowing the municipality to impose tax “on any business, not otherwise specified in the preceding paragraphs, which the sanggunian concerned may deem proper to tax[.]”<br><br>The succeeding proviso of Section 143(h) of the LGC, viz., <i>“Provided,</i> That on any business subject to the excise, value-added or percentage tax under the National Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the rate of tax shall not exceed two percent (2%) of gross sales or receipts of the preceding calendar year[,]” is not a specific grant of power to the municipality or city to impose business tax on the gross sales or receipts of such a business.&nbsp; Rather, the proviso only fixes a maximum rate of imposable business tax in case the business taxed under Section 143(h) of the LGC happens to be subject to excise, value added, or percentage tax under the NIRC.<br><br>The omnibus grant of power to municipalities and cities under Section 143(h) of the LGC cannot overcome the specific exception/exemption in Section 133(j) of the same Code.&nbsp; This is in accord with the rule on statutory construction that specific provisions must prevail over general ones.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup>&nbsp; A special and specific provision prevails over a general provision irrespective of their relative positions in the statute. <i>Generalia specialibus non derogant.</i> Where there is in the same statute a particular enactment and also a general one which in its most comprehensive sense would include what is embraced in the former, the particular enactment must be operative, and the general enactment must be taken to affect only such cases within its general language as are not within the provisions of the particular enactment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, the<i> sanggunian</i> of the municipality or city cannot enact an ordinance imposing business tax on the gross receipts of transportation contractors, persons engaged in the transportation of passengers or freight by hire, and common carriers by air, land, or water, when said <i>sanggunian</i> was already specifically prohibited from doing so.&nbsp; Any exception to the express prohibition under Section 133(j) of the LGC should be just as specific and unambiguous.<br><br><i>Second,</i> the construction adopted by the Court gives effect to both Sections 133(j) and 143(h) of the LGC.&nbsp; In construing a law, care should be taken that every part thereof be given effect and a construction that could render a provision inoperative should be avoided, and inconsistent provisions should be reconciled whenever possible as parts of a harmonious whole.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>As pointed out by William Lines, <i>et al.,</i>, in their Petition, despite the prohibition against LGUs imposing tax on the gross receipts of transportation contractors, persons engaged in the transportation of passengers or freight by hire, and common carriers by air, land, or water, under Section 133(j) of the LGC, there are still other multiple businesses subject to excise, value added, or percentage tax under the NIRC, which the municipalities and cities can still tax pursuant to Section 143(h) of the LGC, such as:<br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">1) </div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Hotels and motels under Sec. 113 of the NIRC;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">2)</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Caterers, taxed under Sec. 114 of the NIRC;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">3) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Dealers in securities, taxed under Sec. 116 of the NIRC;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">4) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Franchise holders, taxed under Sec. 117 of the NIRC;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">5) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Senders of overseas dispatch, message or communication originating in the Philippines, taxed under Sec. 118 of the NIRC;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">6) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Banks and non-bank financial intermediaries, taxed under Sec. 119 of the NIRC;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">7) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Finance companies, taxed under Sec. 120 of the NIRC;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">8)</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Agents of foreign insurance companies, taxed under Sec. 122 of the NIRC;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">9) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Amusement places, taxed under Sec. 123 of the NIRC;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">10) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Winners in horse races, taxed under Sec. 124 of the NIRC;

On the contrary, it would be Section 133(j) of the LGC which would become inoperative should the Court accept the construction proffered by the City of Manila and its public officials, because then, there would be no instance at all when the gross receipts of the transportation contractors, persons engaged in the transportation of passengers or freight by hire, and common carriers by air, land, or water, would not be subject to tax by the LGUs.<br><br><i>Third</i>, Section 5(b) of the LGC itself, on Rules of Interpretation, provides:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 5.&nbsp;

Strictly assessed against the guidelines and limitations set forth in the LGC, Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, was enacted <i>ultra vires.</i><br><br>And <i>fourth,</i> the construction adopted by the Court is in accordance with the consistent intention of the laws to withhold from the LGUs the power to tax transportation contractors, persons engaged in the transportation of passengers or freight by hire, and common carriers by air, land, or water.<br><br>Even prior to Section 133(j) of the LGC, Section 5(e) of Presidential Decree No. 231, otherwise known as The Local Tax Code, as amended, already limited the taxing powers of LGUs as follows:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 5.&nbsp;

Thank you Mr. Speaker.<br><br>Still on page 95, subparagraph 5, on taxes on the business of transportation. This appears to be one of those being deemed to be exempted from the taxing powers of the local government units. <i>May we know the reason why the transportation business is being excluded from the taxing powers of the local government units?</i><br><br>MR. JAVIER (E.). Mr. Speaker, there is an exception contained in Section 121 (now Sec. 131), line 16, paragraph 5. It states that local government units may not impose taxes on the business of transportation, except as otherwise provided in this code.<br><br>Now, Mr. Speaker, if the Gentleman would care to go to page 98 of Book II, one can see there that provinces have the power to impose a tax on business enjoying a franchise at the rate of not more than one-half of 1 percent of the gross annual receipts. So, transportation contractors who are enjoying a franchise would be subject to tax by the province. That is the exception, Mr. Speaker.<br><br><i>What we want to guard against here, Mr. Speaker is the imposition of taxes by local government units on the carrier business. </i>Local government units may impose taxes on top of what is already being imposed by the National Internal Revenue Code which is the so-called “common carriers tax.” <i>We do not want a duplication of this tax, so we just provided for an exception</i> under Section 125 (now Section 137) that a province may impose this tax at a specific rate.<br><br>MR. AQUINO (A.). Thank you for that clarification, Mr. Speaker. . . .</blockquote>It is clear that the legislative intent in excluding from the taxing power of the local government unit the imposition of business tax against common carriers is to prevent a duplication of the so-called “common carrier’s tax.”<br><br>Petitioner is already paying three (3%) percent common carrier's tax on its gross sales/earnings under the National Internal Revenue Code. To tax petitioner again on its gross receipts in its transportation of petroleum business would defeat the purpose of the Local Government Code.
