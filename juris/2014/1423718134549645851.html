Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the
 Honorable Court of Appeals (CA) dated 31 May 2012 in CA-G.R. CEB-CR HC 
No. 00875, which affirmed the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) dated 26 July 
2007, convicting accused-appellant Leonardo Castrodes alias “Adok” 
(Castrodes) for the crime of Rape (Crim. Case No. 00-731) in 
<i>“People of the Philippines v. Leonardo Castrodes</i>”.<br><br><blockquote><center>The Information<br></center><br>That
 on or about the 17<sup>th</sup> day of April, (sic) 2000, 
in the municipality of San Miguel, province of Bohol, Philippines, and 
within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court as a Family Court, the 
above-named accused with lewd designs and by means of force and 
intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously 
inserted his penis into the vagina of the victim, AAA,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> a 15 year old (sic) 
minor against her will and without her consent; to the damage and 
prejudice of the offended party.<br><br>Acts committed contrary to the 
provision of Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code as amended by Republic 
Act No. 7659.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></blockquote><br>We hereby adopt, by 
way of reference, the findings of facts of the appellate court, as 
integral part of this Resolution. The facts as presented by the CA are:<br><br><blockquote><center>The Facts According to the Prosecution<br></center><br>At
 around ten o’clock in the morning of April 17, 2000, fifteen year (sic)
 old AAA was busy gathering firewood on (sic) the coconut plantation 
located just downhill from the house she shared with her aunt BBB and 
uncle CCC.<br><br>Preoccupied with the chore at hand, she was surprised 
when her neighbor, accused-appellant Leonardo Castrodes suddenly 
appeared behind her and wrested from her the bolo she was then using to 
gather firewood.<br><br>With the bolo in his hand, accused-appellant 
embraced and carried AAA to a spot underneath a coconut tree. Shocked, 
AAA could not do anything due to fear of being hacked by 
accused-appellant with the bolo.<br><br>Accused-Appellant then started 
kissing AAA and caressing her breasts. Accused-Appellant then forced AAA
 to lie on the ground and then removed her shorts and panty. He also 
removed his own shorts and brief. With both of them naked waist down, 
accused-appellant Leonardo Castrodes then laid on top of AAA and 
attempted to insert his penis into her vagina.<br><br>Feeling 
accused-appellant’s efforts penetrating her, AAA tried to evade from his
 advances by squirming underneath his hold. Yet, all her efforts were 
for naught, as she was not strong enough to free herself from him.<br><br>When
 he finally was able to penetrate her, AAA felt pain and cried. After 
ravaging AAA, accused-appellant then stood up and put on his clothing. 
As he was towering over AAA, accused-appellant then threatened her that 
should she reveal to anyone what had happened, he will kill her and 
anyone she confided to.<br><br>In her daze, AAA continued crying and 
slowly put on her clothes. She picked up the firewood she had previously
 gathered and returned home.<br><br>AAA kept her silence about the 
ordeal she encountered with accused-appellant until the evening of April
 26, 2000 when her uncle, [CCC], noticed her crying inside their house. 
Concerned as to what had happened to her, [CCC] asked AAA, why she was 
crying. AAA then told [CCC] what had transpired in the morning of April 
17, 2000.<br><br>The next day, BBB with AAA’s father reported the matter
 to the barangay officials in their village and had her examined by the 
Municipal Health Officer.<br><br>Version of the Defense<br><br>Accused-appellant
 Leonardo Castrodes for his part, however, interposes a different 
version of the story. To corroborate his defense, his first cousin, 
Jovenciano Castrodes took the witness stand to affirm his innocence.<br><br>According
 to the defense, accused-appellant Leonardo Castrodes on the fateful day
 of April 17, 2000, was nowhere near the area where the alleged rape 
happened. As on that same day, at around 6:30 in the morning, 
accused-appellant, together with Jovenciano Castrodes, left the former’s
 house and walked towards the latter’s farm.<br><br>After twenty minutes
 of walking, they finally arrived at the farm. They then started working
 around seven o’clock in the morning and only took a break from working 
to take their lunch and again resumed around 1:00 in the afternoon.<br><br>They
 finished working around five o’clock in the afternoon. After the hard 
day’s toil in the farm, the pair returned to accused-appellant’s house 
together.<br><br>Jovenciano Castrodes affirmed that he was physically 
beside his cousin the whole day and there was no moment that he could 
not see Leonardo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></blockquote><br>Upon arraignment, 
Castrodes pleaded not guilty to the crime charged. During the 
presentation of evidence, the prosecution presented three (3) witnesses:
 (1) AAA; (2) Dr. Hamilcar Saniel; and (3) AAA’s uncle, CCC. On the 
other hand, the defense presented Castrodes and Jovencio Castrodes, 
Castrodes’ cousin, as witnesses.<br><br>After trial, the RTC found Castrodes guilty beyond doubt of the crime of rape. The dispositive portion of the decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE,
 finding the accused, LEONARDO CASTRODES guilty beyond reasonable doubt 
of the crime of rape penalized under paragraph 1, Article 266-B of 
Republic Act 8353 amending Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, the 
Court metes upon him the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua 
</i>with all the accessory penalties of the law, with costs. The 
accused is further ordered to pay the offended party, AAA, the amount of
 P50,000.00 as civil indemnity and another P50,000.00 as moral damages.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></blockquote><br>On
 appeal, the CA affirmed with modification Castrodes’ conviction. The CA
 rejected Castrodes’ attempt to cast doubt on AAA’s credibility. 
According to the CA, “testimonies of rape victims who are young and 
immature deserve full credence, considering that no young woman, 
especially of tender age, would concoct a story of defloration, allow an
 examination of her private parts, and thereafter pervert herself by 
being subject to a public trial, if she was not motivated solely by the 
desire to obtain justice for the wrong committed against her.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On AAA’s delay 
in reporting her ordeal, the CA ruled that delay in reporting the rape 
incident does not weaken the case for the prosecution. The CA opined 
that is not uncommon for a young girl to conceal assaults on her 
virtue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>With
 regard to Castrodes’ defense of alibi, the defense failed to prove that
 it was physically impossible for him to be at the crime scene at the 
time of the incident because the crime scene and the farm where 
Castrodes was allegedly working was only a twenty-minute walk from the 
scene of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of the CA Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>IN
 LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the Court hereby AFFIRMS with MODIFICATION 
the assailed Decision dated July 26, 2007 of the Regional Trial Court, 
Branch 52, Talibon, Bohol in Criminal Case No. 00-731. The 
accused-appellant Leonardo Castrodes is found GUILTY of the crime of 
Rape and is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion
 perpetua.</i> He is likewise ordered to indemnify AAA Php 
50,000.00 as civil indemnity, Php 50,000.00 as moral damages, and Php 
30,000.00 as exemplary damages, plus legal interest on all damages 
awarded at the rate of six percent (6%) from the date of the finality of
 this decision.<br><br>SO ORDERED. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></blockquote><br>The
 defense pointed to several circumstances and inconsistencies in the 
prosecution’s evidence, namely: (1) it was highly incredible for AAA to 
bring a bolo when she was just merely gathering firewood; (2) it was 
highly improbable that AAA was raped in broad daylight and in a very 
highly visible area surrounded by eight (8) houses; (3) AAA’s delay in 
reporting the incident, which showed the incredulity of AAA’s 
allegation; and (4) there were no vaginal lacerations found in AAA based
 on the Municipal Health Officer’s report.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>We
 repeat that there is no rule that rape is committed only in 
seclusion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> 
Castrodes’ contention that it was highly improbable that he raped AAA in
 broad daylight and in a very visible area surrounded by eight (8) 
houses deserves scant consideration. A man’s carnality is not hindered 
by time or place—his prurient desire impels him to commit rape even in 
the most public of places.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Delay in reporting an incident of rape 
does not discredit the credibility of a victim. Human experience 
dictates that a rape victim, especially a young girl, who experienced 
sexual assault, is expected to conceal assaults on her virtue;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> this principle 
validates the social stigma a rape victim may suffer after she discloses
 her ordeal, especially in a conservative society such as ours. In 
effect, “the victim may choose to keep quiet rather than expose her 
defilement to the harsh glare of public scrutiny.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Therefore, AAA’s failure to 
immediately report the rape incident does not undermine her credibility 
as a witness.<br><br>The defense alleged that it was highly improbable 
that there was a crime of rape because AAA suffered no vaginal 
lacerations based on the medical examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> We rule in the negative. Time and 
again, we have held that in prosecuting crimes of rape, the medical 
examination is dispensable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> In fact, there could be a finding of rape even 
if the medical examination showed no vaginal laceration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Castrodes’alibi
 that he was working in a farm when AAA was raped is not exculpatory 
because he failed to prove the physical impossibility of his presence at
 the scene of the crime at the time of the incident. As borne by the 
records, Castrodes was just twenty (20) minutes away from the crime 
scene. To merit credence, Castrodes must adduce clear and convincing 
evidence that he was in a place other than the <i>situs 
criminis</i> at the time when the crime was committed, such that 
it was physically impossible for him to have been at the scene of the 
crime when it was committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Clearly, Castrodes failed to prove the fact 
vital to the credibility of the alibi.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>,
