				<H3>FRANCIS H. JARDELEZA PETITIONER, VS. CHIEF JUSTICE MARIA LOURDES P. A. SERENO, THE JUDICIAL AND BAR COUNCIL AND EXECUTIVE SECRETARY PAQUITO N. OCHOA, JR., RESPONDENTS.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MENDOZA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Once again, the Court is faced with a controversy involving the acts of an independent body, which is considered as a constitutional innovation, the Judicial and Bar Council (<i>JBC</i>). It is not the first time that the Court is called upon to settle legal questions surrounding the JBC’s exercise of its constitutional mandate. In <i>De Castro v. JBC</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> the Court laid to rest issues such as the duty of the JBC to recommend prospective nominees for the position of Chief Justice vis-à-vis the appointing power of the President, the period within which the same may be exercised, and the ban on midnight appointments as set forth in the Constitution. In <i>Chavez v. JBC</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> the Court provided an extensive discourse on constitutional intent as to the JBC’s composition and membership.<br><br>This time, however, the selection and nomination process actually undertaken by the JBC is being challenged for being constitutionally infirm. The heart of the debate lies not only on the very soundness and validity of the application of JBC rules but also the extent of its discretionary power. More significantly, this case of first impression impugns the end-result of its acts - the <i>shortlist</i> from which the President appoints a deserving addition to the Highest Tribunal of the land.<br><br>To add yet another feature of novelty to this case, a member of the Court, no less than the Chief Justice herself, was being impleaded as party respondent.<br><br><b>The Facts</b><br><br>The present case finds its genesis from the compulsory retirement of Associate Justice Roberto Abad (<i>Associate Justice Abad</i>) last May 22, 2014. Before his retirement, on March 6, 2014, in accordance with its rules,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> the JBC announced the opening for application or recommendation for the said vacated position.<br><br>On March 14, 2014, the JBC received a letter from Dean Danilo Concepcion of the University of the Philippines nominating petitioner Francis H. Jardeleza (<i>Jardeleza</i>), incumbent Solicitor General of the Republic, for the said position. Upon acceptance of the nomination, Jardeleza was included in the names of candidates, as well as in the schedule of public interviews. On May 29, 2014, Jardeleza was interviewed by the JBC.<br><br>It appears from the averments in the petition that on June 16 and 17, 2014, Jardeleza received telephone calls from former Court of Appeals Associate Justice and incumbent JBC member, Aurora Santiago Lagman (<i>Justice Lagman</i>), who informed him that during the meetings held on June 5 and 16, 2014, Chief Justice and JBC <i>ex-officio</i> Chairperson, Maria Lourdes P.A. Sereno (<i>Chief Justice Sereno</i>), manifested that she would be invoking Section 2, Rule 10 of JBC-009<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> against him. Jardeleza was then directed to “make himself available” before the JBC on June 30, 2014, during which he would be informed of the objections to his integrity.<br><br>Consequently, Jardeleza filed a letter-petition (<i>letter-petition</i>)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> praying that the Court, in the exercise of its constitutional power of supervision over the JBC, issue an order: 1) directing the JBC to give him at least five (5) working days written notice of any hearing of the JBC to which he would be summoned; and the said notice to contain the sworn specifications of the charges against him by his oppositors, the sworn statements of supporting witnesses, if any, and copies of documents in support of the charges; and notice and sworn statements shall be made part of the public record of the JBC; 2) allowing him to cross-examine his oppositors and supporting witnesses, if any, and the cross-examination to be conducted in public, under the same conditions that attend the public interviews held for all applicants; 3) directing the JBC to reset the hearing scheduled on June 30, 2014 to another date; and 4) directing the JBC to disallow Chief Justice Sereno from participating in the voting on June 30, 2014 or at any adjournment thereof where such vote would be taken for the nominees for the position vacated by Associate Justice Abad.<br><br>During the June 30, 2014 meeting of the JBC, sans Jardeleza, incumbent Associate Justice Antonio T. Carpio (<i>Associate Justice Carpio</i>) appeared as a resource person to shed light on a classified legal memorandum (<i>legal memorandum</i>) that would clarify the objection to Jardeleza’s integrity as posed by Chief Justice Sereno. According to the JBC, Chief Justice Sereno questioned Jardeleza’s ability to discharge the duties of his office as shown in a confidential legal memorandum over his handling of an international arbitration case for the government.<br><br>Later, Jardeleza was directed to one of the Court’s ante-rooms where Department of Justice Secretary Leila M. De Lima (<i>Secretary De Lima</i>) informed him that Associate Justice Carpio appeared before the JBC and disclosed confidential information which, to Chief Justice Sereno, characterized his integrity as dubious. After the briefing, Jardeleza was summoned by the JBC at around 2:00 o’clock in the afternoon.<br><br>Jardeleza alleged that he was asked by Chief Justice Sereno if he wanted to defend himself against the integrity issues raised against him. He answered that he would defend himself provided that due process would be observed. Jardeleza specifically demanded that Chief Justice Sereno execute a sworn statement specifying her objections and that he be afforded the right to cross-examine her in a public hearing. He requested that the same directive should also be imposed on Associate Justice Carpio. As claimed by the JBC, Representative Niel G. Tupas Jr. also manifested that he wanted to hear for himself Jardeleza’s explanation on the matter. Jardeleza, however, refused as he would not be lulled into waiving his rights. Jardeleza then put into record a written statement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> expressing his views on the situation and requested the JBC to defer its meeting considering that the Court en banc would meet the next day to act on his pending letter-petition. At this juncture, Jardeleza was excused.<br><br>Later in the afternoon of the same day, and apparently denying Jardeleza’s request for deferment of the proceedings, the JBC continued its deliberations and proceeded to vote for the nominees to be included in the shortlist. Thereafter, the JBC released the subject shortlist of four (4) nominees which included: Apolinario D. Bruselas, Jr. with six (6) votes, Jose C. Reyes, Jr. with six (6) votes, Maria Gracia M. Pulido Tan with five (5) votes, and Reynaldo B. Daway with four (4) votes. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>As mentioned in the petition, a newspaper article was later published in the online portal of the Philippine Daily Inquirer, stating that the Court’s Spokesman, Atty. Theodore Te, revealed that there were actually five (5) nominees who made it to the JBC shortlist, but one (1) nominee could not be included because of the invocation of Rule 10, Section 2 of the JBC rules.<br><br>In its July 8, 2014 Resolution, the Court noted Jardeleza’s letter-petition in view of the transmittal of the JBC list of nominees to the Office of the President, “without prejudice to any remedy available in law and the rules that petitioner may still wish to pursue.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> The said resolution was accompanied by an extensive Dissenting Opinion penned by Associate Justice Arturo D. Brion,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> expressing his respectful disagreement as to the position taken by the majority.<br><br><b><i>The Petition</i></b><br><br>Perceptibly based on the aforementioned resolution’s declaration as to his availment of a remedy in law, Jardeleza filed the present petition for certiorari and mandamus under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court with prayer for the issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO), seeking to compel the JBC to include him in the list of nominees for Supreme Court Associate Justice vice Associate Justice Abad, on the grounds that the JBC and Chief Justice Sereno acted in grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in excluding him, despite having garnered a sufficient number of votes to qualify for the position.<br><br>Notably, Jardeleza’s petition decries that despite the obvious urgency of his earlier letter-petition and its concomitant filing on June 25, 2014, the same was raffled only on July 1, 2014 or a day after the controversial JBC meeting. By the time that his letter-petition was scheduled for deliberation by the Court <i>en banc</i> on July 8, 2014, the disputed shortlist had already been transmitted to the Office of the President. He attributed this belated action on his letter-petition to Chief Justice Sereno, whose action on such matters, especially those impressed with urgency, was discretionary.<br><br>An in-depth perusal of Jardeleza’s petition would reveal that his resort to judicial intervention hinges on the alleged illegality of his exclusion from the shortlist due to: 1) the deprivation of his constitutional right to due process; and 2) the JBC’s erroneous application, if not direct violation, of its own rules. Suffice it to say, Jardeleza directly ascribes the supposed violation of his constitutional rights to the acts of Chief Justice Sereno in raising objections against his integrity and the manner by which the JBC addressed this challenge to his application, resulting in his arbitrary exclusion from the list of nominees.<br><br><b><i>Jardeleza’s Position</i></b><br><br>For a better understanding of the above postulates proffered in the petition, the Court hereunder succinctly summarizes Jardeleza’s arguments, as follows:<br><br><blockquote><b>A. Chief Justice Sereno and the JBC violated Jardeleza’s right to due process in the events leading up to and during the vote on the shortlist last June 30, 2014</b>. When accusations against his integrity were made twice, <i>ex parte</i>, by Chief Justice Sereno, without informing him of the nature and cause thereof and without affording him an opportunity to be heard, Jardeleza was deprived of his right to due process. In turn, the JBC violated his right to due process when he was simply ordered to make himself available on the June 30, 2014 meeting and was told that the objections to his integrity would be made known to him on the same day. Apart from mere verbal notice (by way of a telephone call) of the invocation of Section 2, Rule 10 of JBC-009 against his application and not on the accusations against him <i>per se,</i> he was deprived of an opportunity to mount a proper defense against it. Not only did the JBC fail to ventilate questions on his integrity during his public interview, he was also divested of his rights as an applicant under Sections 3 and 4, Rule 4, JBC-009, to wit:<br><blockquote>Section 3. Testimony of parties. – The Council may receive written opposition to an applicant on the ground of his moral fitness and, at its discretion, the Council may receive the testimony of the oppositor at a hearing conducted for the purpose, with due notice to the applicant who shall be allowed to cross-examine the oppositor and to offer countervailing evidence.<br><br>Section 4. Anonymous Complaints. – Anonymous complaints against an applicant shall not be given due course, unless there appears on its face a probable cause sufficient to engender belief that the allegations may be true. In the latter case, the Council may direct a discreet investigation or require the applicant to comment thereon in writing or during the interview.<br></blockquote>His lack of knowledge as to the identity of his accusers (except for yet again, the verbal information conveyed to him that Associate Justice Carpio testified against him) and as to the nature of the very accusations against him caused him to suffer from the arbitrary action by the JBC and Chief Justice Sereno. The latter gravely abused her discretion when she acted as prosecutor, witness and judge, thereby violating the very essence of fair play and the Constitution itself. In his words: “the sui generis nature of JBC proceedings does not authorize the Chief Justice to assume these roles, nor does it dispense with the need to honor petitioner’s right to due process.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br><b>B. The JBC committed grave abuse of discretion in excluding Jardeleza from the shortlist of nominees, in violation of its own rules</b>. The “unanimity requirement” provided under Section 2, Rule 10 of JBC-009 does not find application when a member of the JBC raises an objection to an applicant’s integrity. Here, the lone objector constituted a part of the membership of the body set to vote. The lone objector could be completely capable of taking hostage the entire voting process by the mere expediency of raising an objection. Chief Justice Sereno’s interpretation of the rule would allow a situation where all that a member has to do to veto other votes, including majority votes, would be to object to the qualification of a candidate, without need for factual basis.<br><br><b>C. Having secured the sufficient number of votes, it was ministerial on the part of the JBC to include Jardeleza in the subject shortlist.</b> Section 1, Rule 10 of JBC-009 provides that a nomination for appointment to a judicial position requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of all members of the JBC. The JBC cannot disregard its own rules. Considering that Jardeleza was able to secure four (4) out of six (6) votes, the only conclusion is that a majority of the members of the JBC found him to be qualified for the position of Associate Justice.<br><br><b>D. The unlawful exclusion of the petitioner from the subject shortlist impairs the President’s constitutional power to appoint.</b> Jardeleza’s exclusion from the shortlist has unlawfully narrowed the President’s choices. Simply put, the President would be constrained to choose from among four (4) nominees, when five (5) applicants rightfully qualified for the position. This limits the President to appoint a member of the Court from a list generated through a process tainted with patent constitutional violations and disregard for rules of justice and fair play. Until these constitutional infirmities are remedied, the petitioner has the right to prevent the appointment of an Associate Justice vice Associate Justice Abad.</blockquote><br><b><i>Comment of the JBC</i></b><br><br>On August 11, 2014, the JBC filed its comment contending that Jardeleza’s petition lacked procedural and substantive bases that would warrant favorable action by the Court. For the JBC, <i>certiorari</i> is only available against a tribunal, a board or an officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> The JBC, in its exercise of its mandate to recommend appointees to the Judiciary, does not exercise any of these functions. In a pending case,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Jardeleza himself, as one of the lawyers for the government, argued in this wise: <i>Certiorari </i>cannot issue against the JBC in the implementation of its policies.<br><br>In the same vein, the remedy of <i>mandamus</i> is incorrect. Mandamus does not lie to compel a discretionary act. For it to prosper, a petition for mandamus must, among other things, show that the petitioner has a clear legal right to the act demanded. In Jardeleza’s case, there is no legal right to be included in the list of nominees for judicial vacancies. Possession of the constitutional and statutory qualifications for appointment to the Judiciary may not be used to legally demand that one’s name be included in the list of candidates for a judicial vacancy. One’s inclusion in the shortlist is strictly within the discretion of the JBC.<br><br>Anent the substantive issues, the JBC mainly denied that Jardeleza was deprived of due process. The JBC reiterated that Justice Lagman, on behalf of the JBC <i>en banc</i>, called Jardeleza and informed him that Chief Justice Sereno would be invoking Section 2, Rule 10 of JBC-009 due to a question on his integrity based on the way he handled a very important case for the government. Jardeleza and Justice Lagman spoke briefly about the case and his general explanation on how he handled the same. Secretary De Lima likewise informed him about the content of the impending objection against his application. On these occasions, Jardeleza agreed to explain himself. Come the June 30, 2014 meeting, however, Jardeleza refused to shed light on the allegations against him, as he chose to deliver a statement, which, in essence, requested that his accuser and her witnesses file sworn statements so that he would know of the allegations against him, that he be allowed to cross-examine the witnesses; and that the procedure be done on record and in public.<br><br>In other words, Jardeleza was given ample opportunity to be heard and to enlighten each member of the JBC on the issues raised against him prior to the voting process. His request for a sworn statement and opportunity to cross-examine is not supported by a demandable right. The JBC is not a fact-finding body. Neither is it a court nor a quasi-judicial agency. The members are not concerned with the determination of his guilt or innocence of the accusations against him.<br><br>Besides, Sections 3 and 4, Rule 10, JBC-009 are merely directory as shown by the use of the word “may.” Even the conduct of a hearing to determine the veracity of an opposition is discretionary on the JBC. Ordinarily, if there are other ways of ascertaining the truth or falsity of an allegation or opposition, the JBC would not call a hearing in order to avoid undue delay of the selection process. Each member of the JBC relies on his or her own appreciation of the circumstances and qualifications of applicants.<br><br>The JBC then proceeded to defend adherence to its standing rules. As a general rule, an applicant is included in the shortlist when he or she obtains an affirmative vote of at least a majority of all the members of the JBC. When Section 2, Rule 10 of JBC-009, however, is invoked because an applicant’s integrity is challenged, a unanimous vote is required. Thus, when Chief Justice Sereno invoked the said provision, Jardeleza needed the affirmative vote of all the JBC members to be included in the shortlist. In the process, Chief Justice Sereno’s vote against Jardeleza was not counted. Even then, he needed the votes of the five (5) remaining members. He only got four (4) affirmative votes. As a result, he was not included in the shortlist. Applicant Reynaldo B. Daway, who got four (4) affirmative votes, was included in the shortlist because his integrity was not challenged. As to him, the “majority rule” was considered applicable.<br><br>Lastly, the JBC rued that Jardeleza sued the respondents in his capacity as Solicitor General. Despite claiming a prefatory appearance <i>in propria persona</i>, all pleadings filed with the Court were signed in his official capacity. In effect, he sued the respondents to pursue a purely private interest while retaining the office of the Solicitor General. By suing the very parties he was tasked by law to defend, Jardeleza knowingly placed himself in a situation where his personal interests collided against his public duties, in clear violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Code of Professional Ethics. Moreover, the respondents are all public officials being sued in their official capacity. By retaining his title as Solicitor General, and suing in the said capacity, Jardeleza filed a suit against his own clients, being the legal defender of the government and its officers. This runs contrary to the fiduciary relationship shared by a lawyer and his client.<br><br>In opposition to Jardeleza’s prayer for the issuance of a TRO, the JBC called to mind the constitutional period within which a vacancy in the Court must be filled. As things now stand, the President has until August 20, 2014 to exercise his appointment power which cannot be restrained by a TRO or an injunctive suit.<br><br><b><i>Comment of the Executive Secretary</i></b><br><br>In his Comment, Executive Secretary Paquito N. Ochoa Jr. (<i>Executive Secretary</i>) raised the possible unconstitutionality of Section 2, Rule 10 of JBC-009, particularly the imposition of a higher voting threshold in cases where the integrity of an applicant is challenged. It is his position that the subject JBC rule impairs the body’s collegial character, which essentially operates on the basis of majority rule. The application of Section 2, Rule 10 of JBC-009 gives rise to a situation where all that a member needs to do, in order to disqualify an applicant who may well have already obtained a majority vote, is to object to his integrity. In effect, a member who invokes the said provision is given a veto power that undermines the equal and full participation of the other members in the nomination process. A lone objector may then override the will of the majority, rendering illusory, the collegial nature of the JBC and the very purpose for which it was created—to shield the appointment process from political maneuvering. Further, Section 2, Rule 10 of JBC-009 may be violative of due process for it does not allow an applicant any meaningful opportunity to refute the challenges to his integrity. While other provisions of the JBC rules provide mechanisms enabling an applicant to comment on an opposition filed against him, the subject rule does not afford the same opportunity. In this case, Jardeleza’s allegations as to the events which transpired on June 30, 2014 obviously show that he was neither informed of the accusations against him nor given the chance to muster a defense thereto.<br><br>The Executive Secretary then offered a supposition: granting that the subject provision is held to be constitutional, the “unanimity rule” would only be operative when the objector is not a member of the JBC. It is only in this scenario where the voting of the body would not be rendered inconsequential. In the event that a JBC member raised the objection, what should have been applied is the general rule of a majority vote, where any JBC member retains their respective reservations to an application with a negative vote. Corollary thereto, the unconstitutionality of the said rule would necessitate the inclusion of Jardeleza in the shortlist submitted to the President.<br><br><b><i>Other pleadings</i></b><br><br>On August 12, 2014, Jardeleza was given the chance to refute the allegations of the JBC in its Comment. He submitted his Reply thereto on August 15, 2014. A few hours thereafter, or barely ten minutes prior to the closing of business, the Court received the Supplemental Comment-Reply of the JBC, this time with the attached minutes of the proceedings that led to the filing of the petition, and a detailed “Statement of the Chief Justice on the Integrity Objection.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Obviously, Jardeleza’s Reply consisted only of his arguments against the JBC’s original Comment, as it was filed prior to the filing of the Supplemental Comment-Reply.<br><br>At the late stage of the case, two motions to admit comments-in-intervention/oppositions-in-intervention were filed. One was by Atty. Purificacion S. Bartolome-Bernabe, purportedly the President of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines-Bulacan Chapter. This pleading echoed the position of the JBC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>The other one was filed by Atty. Reynaldo A. Cortes, purportedly a former President of the IBP Baguio-Benguet Chapter and former Governor of the IBP-Northern Luzon. It was coupled with a complaint for disbarment against Jardeleza primarily for violations of the Code of Professional Responsibility for representing conflicting interests.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Both motions for intervention were denied considering that time was of the essence and their motions were merely reiterative of the positions of the JBC and were perceived to be dilatory. The complaint for disbarment, however, was re-docketed as a separate administrative case.<br><br><center><b>The Issues</b><br></center><br>Amidst a myriad of issues submitted by the parties, most of which are interrelated such that the resolution of one issue would necessarily affect the conclusion as to the others, the Court opts to narrow down the questions to the very source of the discord - the correct application of Section 2, Rule 10 JBC-009 and its effects, if any, on the substantive rights of applicants.<br><br>The Court is not unmindful of the fact that a facial scrutiny of the petition does not directly raise the unconstitutionality of the subject JBC rule. Instead, it bewails the unconstitutional effects of its application. It is only from the comment of the Executive Secretary where the possible unconstitutionality of the rule was brought to the fore. Despite this milieu, a practical approach dictates that the Court must confront the source of the bleeding from which the gaping wound presented to the Court suffers.<br><br>The issues for resolution are:<br><br><blockquote><b><center>I.</center><br>WHETHER OR NOT THE COURT CAN ASSUME JURISDICTION AND GIVE DUE COURSE TO THE SUBJECT PETITION FOR CERTIORARI AND MANDAMUS (WITH APPLICATION FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER).<br><br><center>II</center><br>WHETHER OR NOT THE ISSUES RAISED AGAINST JARDELEZA BEFIT “QUESTIONS OR CHALLENGES ON INTEGRITY” AS CONTEMPLATED UNDER SECTION 2, RULE 10 OF JBC-009.<br><br><center>II.</center><br>WHETHER OR NOT THE RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS IS AVAILABLE IN THE COURSE OF JBC PROCEEDINGS IN CASES WHERE AN OBJECTION OR OPPOSITION TO AN APPLICATION IS RAISED.<br><br><center>III.</center><br>WHETHER OR NOT PETITIONER JARDELEZA MAY BE INCLUDED IN THE SHORTLIST OF NOMINEES SUBMITTED TO THE PRESIDENT.</b></blockquote><br><center><b>The Court’s Ruling</b></center><br><br><b><i>I – Procedural Issue: The Court<br>has constitutional bases to assume<br>jurisdiction over the case<br></i></b><br><b><i>A - The Court’s Power of Supervision<br>over the JBC</i></b><br><br>Section 8, Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution provides for the creation of the JBC. The Court was given supervisory authority over it. Section 8 reads:<br><br><blockquote>Section 8.<br><br>A Judicial and Bar Council is hereby created <b>under the supervision of the Supreme Court</b> composed of the Chief Justice as ex officio Chairman, the Secretary of Justice, and a representative of the Congress as ex officio Members, a representative of the Integrated Bar, a professor of law, a retired Member of the Supreme Court, and a representative of the private sector. [Emphasis supplied]</blockquote><br>As a meaningful guidepost, jurisprudence provides the definition and scope of supervision. It is the power of oversight, or the authority to see that subordinate officers perform their duties. It ensures that the laws and the rules governing the conduct of a government entity are observed and complied with. Supervising officials see to it that rules are followed, but they themselves do not lay down such rules, nor do they have the discretion to modify or replace them. If the rules are not observed, they may order the work done or redone, but only to conform to such rules. They may not prescribe their own manner of execution of the act. They have no discretion on this matter except to see to it that the rules are followed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Based on this, the supervisory authority of the Court over the JBC covers the overseeing of compliance with its rules. In this case, Jardeleza’s principal allegations in his petition merit the exercise of this supervisory authority.<br><br><b><i>B- Availability of the Remedy of Mandamus</i></b><br><br>The Court agrees with the JBC that a writ of mandamus is not available. “<i>Mandamus</i> lies to compel the performance, when refused, of a ministerial duty, but not to compel the performance of a discretionary duty. <i>Mandamus</i> will not issue to control or review the exercise of discretion of a public officer where the law imposes upon said public officer the right and duty to exercise his judgment in reference to any matter in which he is required to act. It is his judgment that is to be exercised and not that of the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> There is no question that the JBC’s duty to nominate is discretionary and it may not be compelled to do something.<br><br><b>C- Availability of the Remedy of Certiorari</b><br><br>Respondent JBC opposed the petition for <i>certiorari</i> on the ground that it does not exercise judicial or quasi-judicial functions. Under Section 1 of Rule 65, a writ of<i> certiorari</i> is directed against a tribunal exercising judicial or quasi-judicial function. “Judicial functions are exercised by a body or officer clothed with authority to determine what the law is and what the legal rights of the parties are with respect to the matter in controversy. Quasi-judicial function is a term that applies to the action or discretion of public administrative officers or bodies given the authority to investigate facts or ascertain the existence of facts, hold hearings, and draw conclusions from them as a basis for their official action using discretion of a judicial nature.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> It asserts that in the performance of its function of recommending appointees for the judiciary, the JBC does not exercise judicial or quasi-judicial functions. Hence, the resort to such remedy to question its actions is improper.<br><br>In this case, Jardeleza cries that although he earned a qualifying number of votes in the JBC, it was negated by the invocation of the “unanimity rule” on integrity in violation of his right to due process guaranteed not only by the Constitution but by the Council’s own rules. For said reason, the Court is of the position that it can exercise the expanded judicial power of review vested upon it by the 1987 Constitution. Thus:<br><br><blockquote><center>Article VIII.</center><br>Section 1. The judicial power is vested in one Supreme Court and in such lower courts as may be established by law.<br><br>Judicial power includes the duty of the courts of justice to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable, and to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government.</blockquote><br>It has been judicially settled that a petition for <i>certiorari</i> is a proper remedy to question the act of any branch or instrumentality of the government on the ground of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction by any branch or instrumentality of the government, <i>even if the latter does not exercise judicial, quasi-judicial or ministerial functions.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>In a case like this, where constitutional bearings are too blatant to ignore, the Court does not find passivity as an alternative. The <i>impasse</i> must be overcome.<br><br><b>II – <i>Substantial Issues</i></b><br><br><i>Examining the Unanimity Rule of the<br>JBC in cases where an applicant’s <br>integrity is challenged </i><br><br>The purpose of the JBC’s existence is indubitably rooted in the categorical constitutional declaration that “[a] member of the judiciary must be a person of proven competence, integrity, probity, and independence.” To ensure the fulfillment of these standards in every member of the Judiciary, the JBC has been tasked to screen aspiring judges and justices, among others, making certain that the nominees submitted to the President are all qualified and suitably best for appointment. In this way, the appointing process itself is shielded from the possibility of extending judicial appointment to the undeserving and mediocre and, more importantly, to the ineligible or disqualified.<br><br>In the performance of this sacred duty, the JBC itself admits, as stated in the “whereas clauses” of JBC-009, that qualifications such as “competence, integrity, probity and independence are not easily determinable as they are developed and nurtured through the years.” Additionally, “it is not possible or advisable to lay down iron-clad rules to determine the fitness of those who aspire to become a Justice, Judge, Ombudsman or Deputy Ombudsman.” Given this realistic situation, there is a need “to promote stability and uniformity in JBC’s guiding precepts and principles.” A set of uniform criteria had to be established in the ascertainment of “whether one meets the minimum constitutional qualifications and possesses qualities of mind and heart expected of him” and his office. Likewise for the sake of transparency of its proceedings, the JBC had put these criteria in writing, now in the form of JBC-009. True enough, guidelines have been set in the determination of competence,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> “probity and independence,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> “soundness of physical and mental condition,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> and “integrity.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>As disclosed by the guidelines and lists of recognized evidence of qualification laid down in JBC-009, “integrity” is closely related to, or if not, approximately equated to an applicant’s good reputation for honesty, incorruptibility, irreproachable conduct, and fidelity to <b><i>sound moral and ethical standards</i></b>. That is why proof of an applicant’s reputation may be shown in certifications or testimonials from reputable government officials and non-governmental organizations and clearances from the courts, National Bureau of Investigation, and the police, among others. In fact, the JBC may even conduct a discreet background check and receive feedback from the public on the integrity, reputation and character of the applicant, the merits of which shall be verified and checked. As a qualification, the term is taken to refer to a virtue, such that, “integrity is the quality of person’s character.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The foregoing premise then begets the question: Does Rule 2, Section 10 of JBC-009, in imposing the “unanimity rule,” contemplate a doubt on the moral character of an applicant?<br><br>Section 2, Rule 10 of JBC-009 provides:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 2. <i>Votes required when integrity of a qualified applicant is challenged.</i> - In every case where the integrity of an applicant who is not otherwise disqualified for nomination is raised or challenged, the affirmative vote of all the Members of the Council must be obtained for the favorable consideration of his nomination.</blockquote><br>A simple reading of the above provision undoubtedly elicits the rule that a higher voting requirement is absolute in cases where the integrity of an applicant is questioned. Simply put, when an integrity question arises, the voting requirement for his or her inclusion as a nominee to a judicial post becomes “unanimous” instead of the “majority vote” required in the preceding section.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Considering that JBC-009 employs the term “integrity” as an essential qualification for appointment, and its doubtful existence in a person merits a higher hurdle to surpass, that is, <i>the unanimous vote of all the members of the JBC</i>, the Court is of the safe conclusion that “integrity” as used in the rules must be interpreted uniformly. Hence, Section 2, Rule 10 of JBC-009 envisions only a situation where an applicant’s moral fitness is challenged. It follows then that the “unanimity rule” only comes into operation when the moral character of a person is put in issue. It finds no application where the question is essentially unrelated to an applicant’s moral uprightness.<br><br><i>Examining the “questions of <br>integrity” made against Jardeleza</i><br><br>The Court will now examine the propriety of applying Section 2, Rule 10 of JBC-009 to Jardeleza’s case.<br><br>The minutes of the JBC meetings, attached to the Supplemental Comment-Reply, reveal that during the June 30, 2014 meeting, not only the question on his actuations in the handling of a case was called for explanation by the Chief Justice, but two other grounds as well tending to show his lack of integrity: a supposed extra-marital affair in the past and alleged acts of insider trading.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Against this factual backdrop, the Court notes that the initial or original invocation of Section 2, Rule 10 of JBC-009 was grounded on Jardeleza’s “inability to discharge the duties of his office” as shown in a legal memorandum related to Jardeleza’s manner of representing the government in a legal dispute. The records bear that the “unanimity rule” was initially invoked by Chief Justice Sereno during the JBC meeting held on June 5, 2014, where she expressed her position that Jardeleza did not possess the integrity required to be a member of the Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> In the same meeting, the Chief Justice shared with the other JBC members the details of Jardeleza’s chosen manner of framing the government’s position in a case and how this could have been detrimental to the national interest.<br><br>In the JBC’s original comment, the details of the Chief Justice’s claim against Jardeleza’s integrity were couched in general terms. The particulars thereof were only supplied to the Court in the JBC’s Supplemental Comment-Reply. Apparently, the JBC acceded to Jardeleza’s demand to make the accusations against him public. At the outset, the JBC declined to raise the fine points of the integrity question in its original Comment due to its significant bearing on the country’s foreign relations and national security. At any rate, the Court restrains itself from delving into the details thereof in this disposition. The confidential nature of the document cited therein, which requires the observance of utmost prudence, preclude a discussion that may possibly affect the country’s position in a pending dispute.<br><br>Be that as it may, the Court has to resolve the standing questions: Does the original invocation of Section 2, Rule 10 of JBC-009 involve a question on Jardeleza’s integrity? Does his adoption of a specific legal strategy in the handling of a case bring forth a relevant and logical challenge against his moral character? Does the “unanimity rule” apply in cases where the main point of contention is the professional judgment <i>sans</i> charges or implications of immoral or corrupt behavior?<br><br>The Court answers these questions in the negative.<br><br>While Chief Justice Sereno claims that the invocation of Section 2, Rule 10 of JBC-009 was not borne out of a mere variance of legal opinion but by an “act of disloyalty” committed by Jardeleza in the handling of a case, the fact remains that the basis for her invocation of the rule was the “disagreement” in legal strategy as expressed by a group of international lawyers. The approach taken by Jardeleza in that case was opposed to that preferred by the legal team. For said reason, criticism was hurled against his “integrity.” The invocation of the “unanimity rule” on integrity traces its roots to the exercise of his discretion as a lawyer and nothing else. No connection was established linking his choice of a legal strategy to a treacherous intent to trounce upon the country’s interests or to betray the Constitution.<br><br>Verily, disagreement in legal opinion is but a normal, if not an essential form of, interaction among members of the legal community. A lawyer has complete discretion on what legal strategy to employ in a case entrusted to him<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> provided that he lives up to his duty to serve his client with competence and diligence, and that he exert his best efforts to protect the interests of his client within the bounds of the law. Consonantly, a lawyer is not an insurer of victory for clients he represents. An infallible grasp of legal principles and technique by a lawyer is a utopian ideal.&nbsp; Stripped of a clear showing of gross neglect, iniquity, or immoral purpose, a strategy of a legal mind remains a legal tactic acceptable to some and deplorable to others. It has no direct bearing on his moral choices.<br><br>As shown in the minutes, the other JBC members expressed their reservations on whether the ground invoked by Chief Justice Sereno could be classified as a “question of integrity” under Section 2, Rule 10 of JBC-009.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> These reservations were evidently sourced from the fact that there was no clear indication that the tactic was a “brainchild” of Jardeleza, as it might have been a collective idea by the legal team which initially sought a different manner of presenting the country’s arguments, and there was no showing either of a corrupt purpose on his part.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Even Chief Justice Sereno was not certain that Jardeleza’s acts were urged by politicking or lured by extraneous promises.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Besides, the President, who has the final say on the conduct of the country’s advocacy in the case, has given no signs that Jardeleza’s action constituted disloyalty or a betrayal of the country’s trust and interest. While this point does not entail that only the President may challenge Jardeleza’s doubtful integrity, it is commonsensical to assume that he is in the best position to suspect a treacherous agenda. The records are bereft of any information that indicates this suspicion. In fact, the Comment of the Executive Secretary expressly prayed for Jardeleza’s inclusion in the disputed shortlist.<br><br>The Court notes the zeal shown by the Chief Justice regarding international cases, given her participation in the PIATCO case and the Belgian Dredging case. Her efforts in the determination of Jardeleza’s professional background, while commendable, have not produced a patent demonstration of a connection between the act complained of and his integrity as a person. Nonetheless, the Court cannot consider her invocation of Section 2, Rule 10 of JBC-009 as conformably within the contemplation of the rule. To fall under Section 2, Rule 10 of JBC-009, there must be a showing that the act complained of is, at the least, linked to the moral character of the person and not to his judgment as a professional. What this disposition perceives, therefore, is the inapplicability of Section 2, Rule 10 of JBC-009 to the original ground of its invocation.<br><br>As previously mentioned, Chief Justice Sereno raised the issues of Jardeleza’s alleged extra-marital affair and acts of insider-trading <i>for the first time only </i>during the June 30, 2014 meeting of the JBC.&nbsp; As can be gleaned from the minutes of the June 30, 2014 meeting, the inclusion of these issues had its origin from newspaper reports that the Chief Justice might raise issues of “immorality” against Jardeleza.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> The Chief Justice then deduced that the “immorality” issue referred to by the media might have been the incidents that could have transpired when Jardeleza was still the General Counsel of San Miguel Corporation. She stated that inasmuch as the JBC had the duty to “take every possible step to verify the qualification of the applicants,” it might as well be clarified.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Do these issues fall within the purview of “questions on integrity” under Section 2, Rule 10 of JBC-009? The Court nods in assent. These are valid issues.<br><br>This acquiescence is consistent with the Court’s discussion supra. Unlike the first ground which centered on Jardeleza’s stance on the tactical approach in pursuing the case for the government, the claims of an illicit relationship and acts of insider trading bear a candid relation to his moral character. Jurisprudence<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> is replete with cases where a lawyer’s deliberate participation in extra-marital affairs was considered as a disgraceful stain on one’s ethical and moral principles. The bottom line is that a lawyer who engages in extra-marital affairs is deemed to have failed to adhere to the exacting standards of morality and decency which every member of the Judiciary is expected to observe. In fact, even relationships which have never gone physical or intimate could still be subject to charges of immorality, when a lawyer, who is married, admits to having a relationship which was more than professional, more than acquaintanceship, more than friendly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> As the Court has held: Immorality has not been confined to sexual matters, but includes conduct inconsistent with rectitude, or indicative of corruption, indecency, depravity and dissoluteness; or is willful, flagrant, or shameless conduct showing moral indifference to opinions of respectable members of the community and an inconsiderate attitude toward good order and public welfare.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Moral character is not a subjective term but one that corresponds to objective reality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> To have a good moral character, a person must have the personal characteristic of being good. It is not enough that he or she has a good reputation, that is, the opinion generally entertained about a person or the estimate in which he or she is held by the public in the place where she is known.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Hence, lawyers are at all times subject to the watchful public eye and community approbation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>The element of “willingness” to linger in indelicate relationships imputes a weakness in one’s values, self-control and on the whole, sense of honor, not only because it is a bold disregard of the sanctity of marriage and of the law, but because it erodes the public’s confidence in the Judiciary. This is no longer a matter of an honest lapse in judgment but a dissolute exhibition of disrespect toward sacred vows taken before God and the law.<br><br>On the other hand, insider trading is an offense that assaults the integrity of our vital securities market.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Manipulative devices and deceptive practices, including insider trading, throw a monkey wrench right into the heart of the securities industry. When someone trades in the market with unfair advantage in the form of highly valuable secret inside information, all other participants are defrauded. All of the mechanisms become worthless. Given enough of stock market scandals coupled with the related loss of faith in the market, such abuses could presage a severe drain of capital. And investors would eventually feel more secure with their money invested elsewhere.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> In its barest essence, insider trading involves the trading of securities based on knowledge of material information not disclosed to the public at the time. Clearly, an allegation of insider trading involves the propensity of a person to engage in fraudulent activities that may speak of his moral character.<br><br>These two issues can be properly categorized as “questions on integrity” under Section 2, Rule 10 of JBC-009. They fall within the ambit of “questions on integrity.” Hence, the “unanimity rule” may come into operation as the subject provision is worded.<br><br><i>The Availability of Due Process<br>in the Proceedings of the JBC</i><br><br>In advocacy of his position, Jardeleza argues that: 1] he should have been informed of the accusations against him in writing; 2] he was not furnished the basis of the accusations, that is, “a very confidential legal memorandum that clarifies the integrity objection”; 3] instead of heeding his request for an opportunity to defend himself, the JBC considered his refusal to explain, during the June 30, 2014 meeting, as a waiver of his right to answer the unspecified allegations; 4] the voting of the JBC was railroaded; and 5] the alleged “discretionary” nature of Sections 3 and 4 of JBC-009 is negated by the subsequent effectivity of JBC-010, Section 1(2) of which provides for a 10-day period from the publication of the list of candidates within which any complaint or opposition against a candidate may be filed with the JBC Secretary; 6] Section 2 of JBC-010 requires complaints and oppositions to be in writing and under oath, copies of which shall be furnished the candidate in order for him to file his comment within five (5) days from receipt thereof; and 7] Sections 3 to 6 of JBC-010 prescribe a logical, reasonable and sequential series of steps in securing a candidate’s right to due process.<br><br>The JBC counters these by insisting that it is not obliged to afford Jardeleza the right to a hearing in the fulfillment of its duty to recommend. The JBC, as a body, is not required by law to hold hearings on the qualifications of the nominees. The process by which an objection is made based on Section 2, Rule 10 of JBC-009 is not judicial, quasi-judicial, or fact-finding, for it does not aim to determine guilt or innocence akin to a criminal or administrative offense but to ascertain the fitness of an applicant vis-à-vis the requirements for the position. Being <i>sui generis,</i> the proceedings of the JBC do not confer the rights insisted upon by Jardeleza. He may not exact the application of rules of procedure which are, at the most, discretionary or optional. Finally, Jardeleza refused to shed light on the objections against him. During the June 30, 2014 meeting, he did not address the issues, but instead chose to tread on his view that the Chief Justice had unjustifiably become his accuser, prosecutor and judge.<br><br>The crux of the issue is on the availability of the right to due process in JBC proceedings. After a tedious review of the parties’ respective arguments, the Court concludes that the right to due process is available and thereby demandable as a matter of right.<br><br>The Court does not brush aside the unique and special nature of JBC proceedings. Indeed, they are distinct from criminal proceedings where the finding of guilt or innocence of the accused is <i>sine qua non.</i> The JBC’s constitutional duty to recommend qualified nominees to the President cannot be compared to the duty of the courts of law to determine the commission of an offense and ascribe the same to an accused, consistent with established rules on evidence. Even the quantum of evidence required in criminal cases is far from the discretion accorded to the JBC.<br><br>The Court, however, could not accept, lock, stock and barrel, the argument that an applicant’s access to the rights afforded under the due process clause is discretionary on the part of the JBC. While the facets of criminal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> and administrative<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> due process are not strictly applicable to JBC proceedings, their peculiarity is insufficient to justify the conclusion that due process is not demandable.<br><br>In JBC proceedings, an aspiring judge or justice justifies his qualifications for the office when he presents proof of his scholastic records, work experience and laudable citations. His goal is to establish that he is qualified for the office applied for. The JBC then takes every possible step to verify an applicant's track record for the purpose of determining whether or not he is qualified for nomination. It ascertains the factors which entitle an applicant to become a part of the roster from which the President appoints.<br><br>The fact that a proceeding is <i>sui generis</i> and is impressed with discretion, however, does not automatically denigrate an applicant’s entitlement to due process. It is well-established in jurisprudence that disciplinary proceedings against lawyers are <i>sui generis </i>in that they are neither purely civil nor purely criminal; they involve investigations by the Court into the conduct of one of its officers, not the trial of an action or a suit. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Hence, in the exercise of its disciplinary powers, the Court merely calls upon a member of the Bar to account for his actuations as an officer of the Court with the end in view of preserving the purity of the legal profession and the proper and honest administration of justice by purging the profession of members who, by their misconduct, have proved themselves no longer worthy to be entrusted with the duties and responsibilities pertaining to the office of an attorney. In such posture, there can be no occasion to speak of a complainant or a prosecutor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> On the whole, disciplinary proceedings are actually aimed to <i>verify</i> and finally determine, if a lawyer charged is still <i>qualified</i> to benefit from the rights and privileges that membership in the legal profession evoke.<br><br>Notwithstanding being “a class of its own,” the right to be heard and to explain one’s self is availing. The Court subscribes to the view that in cases where an objection to an applicant’s qualifications is raised, the observance of due process neither negates nor renders illusory the fulfillment of the duty of JBC to recommend. This holding is not an encroachment on its discretion in the nomination process. Actually, its adherence to the precepts of due process supports and enriches the exercise of its discretion. When an applicant, who vehemently denies the truth of the objections, is afforded the chance to protest, the JBC is presented with a clearer understanding of the situation it faces, thereby guarding the body from making an unsound and capricious assessment of information brought before it. The JBC is not expected to strictly apply the rules of evidence in its assessment of an objection against an applicant. Just the same, to hear the side of the person challenged complies with the dictates of fairness for the only test that an exercise of discretion must surmount is that of soundness.<br><br>A more pragmatic take on the matter of due process in JBC proceedings also compels the Court to examine its current rules. The pleadings of the parties mentioned two: 1] JBC-009 and 2] JBC-010. The former provides the following provisions pertinent to this case:<br><br><blockquote><b>SECTION 1.</b> <i>Evidence of integrity</i>. - The Council shall take every possible step to verify the applicant's record of and reputation for honesty, integrity, incorruptibility, irreproachable conduct, and fidelity to sound moral and ethical standards. For this purpose, the applicant shall submit to the Council certifications or testimonials thereof from reputable government officials and non-governmental organizations, and clearances from the courts, National Bureau of Investigation, police, and from such other agencies as the Council may require.<br><br><b>SECTION 2</b>. <i>Background check.</i> - The Council <b>may</b> order a discreet background check on the integrity, reputation and character of the applicant, and receive feedback thereon from the public, which it shall check or verify to validate the merits thereof.<br><br><b>SECTION 3.</b> <i>Testimony of parties.-</i> The Council <b>may </b>receive written opposition to an applicant on ground of his moral fitness and, at its discretion, the Council <b>may</b> receive the testimony of the oppositor at a hearing conducted for the purpose, with due notice to the applicant who shall be allowed to cross-examine the oppositor and to offer countervailing evidence.<br><br><b>SECTION 4.</b> <i>Anonymous complaints.</i> - Anonymous complaints against an applicant shall not be given due course, unless there appears on its face a probable cause sufficient to engender belief that the allegations may be true. In the latter case, the Council may either direct a discreet investigation or require the applicant to comment thereon in writing or during the interview. [<i>Emphases Supplied</i>]</blockquote><br>While the “unanimity rule” invoked against him is found in JBC-009, Jardeleza urges the Court to hold that the subsequent rule, JBC-010,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> squarely applies to his case. Entitled as a “Rule to Further Promote Public Awareness of and Accessibility to the Proceedings of the Judicial and Bar Council,” JBC-010 recognizes the need for transparency and public awareness of JBC proceedings. In pursuance thereof, JBC-010 was crafted in this wise:<br><br><blockquote><b>SECTION 1.</b> The Judicial and Bar Council shall deliberate to determine who of the candidates meet <i>prima facie</i> the qualifications for the position under consideration. For this purpose, it shall prepare a long list of candidates who <i>prima facie</i> appear to have all the qualifications.<br><br>The Secretary of the Council shall then cause to be published in two (2) newspapers of general circulation a notice of the long list of candidates in alphabetical order.<br><br>The notice shall inform the public that <b>any</b> complaint or opposition against a candidate may be filed with the Secretary within ten (10) days thereof.<br><br><b>SECTION 2.</b> The complaint or opposition <b>shall</b> be <b>in writing</b>, under oath and in ten (10) legible copies, together with its supporting annexes. It shall strictly relate to the qualifications of the candidate or lack thereof, as provided for in the Constitution, statutes, and the Rules of the Judicial and Bar Council, as well as resolutions or regulations promulgated by it.<br><br>The Secretary of the Council <b>shall</b> furnish the candidate a copy of the complaint or opposition against him. The candidate <b>shall</b> have five (5) days from receipt thereof within which to file his comment to the complaint or opposition, if he so desires.<br><br><b>SECTION 3.</b> The Judicial and Bar Council <b>shall</b> fix a date when it shall meet in executive session to consider the qualification of the long list of candidates and the complaint or opposition against them, if any. The Council may, on its own, conduct a discreet investigation of the background of the candidates.<br><br>On the basis of its evaluation of the qualification of the candidates, the Council shall prepare the shorter list of candidates whom it desires to interview for its further consideration.<br><br><b>SECTION 4.</b> The Secretary of the Council shall again cause to be published the dates of the interview of candidates in the shorter list in two (2) newspapers of general circulation. It shall likewise be posted in the websites of the Supreme Court and the Judicial and Bar Council.<br><br>The candidates, as well as their oppositors, <b>shall </b>be separately notified of the date and place of the interview.<br><br><b>SECTION 5.</b> The interviews <b>shall</b> be conducted in public. During the interview, only the members of the Council can ask questions to the candidate. <b>Among other things, the candidate can be made to explain the complaint or opposition against him</b>.<br><br><b>SECTION 6. </b>After the interviews, the Judicial and Bar Council shall again meet in executive session for the final deliberation on the short list of candidates which shall be sent to the Office of the President as a basis for the exercise of the Presidential power of appointment. [Emphases supplied]</blockquote><br>Anent the interpretation of these existing rules, the JBC contends that Sections 3 and 4, Rule 10 of JBC-009 are merely directory in nature as can be gleaned from the use of the word “may.” Thus, the conduct of a hearing under Rule 4 of JBC-009 is permissive and/or discretionary on the part of the JBC. Even the conduct of a hearing to determine the veracity of an opposition is discretionary for there are ways, besides a hearing, to ascertain the truth or falsity of allegations. Succinctly, this argument suggests that the JBC has the discretion to hold or not to hold a hearing when an objection to an applicant’s integrity is raised and that it may resort to other means to accomplish its objective. Nevertheless, JBC adds, “what is mandatory, however, is that if the JBC, in its discretion, receives a testimony of an oppositor in a hearing, due notice shall be given to the applicant and that shall be allowed to <i>cross-examine </i>the oppositor.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Again, the Court neither intends to strip the JBC of its discretion to recommend nominees nor proposes that the JBC conduct a full-blown trial when objections to an application are submitted. Still, it is unsound to say that, all together, the observance of due process is a part of JBC’s discretion when an opposition to an application is made of record. While it may so rely on “other means” such as character clearances, testimonials, and discreet investigation to aid it in forming a judgment of an applicant’s qualifications, the Court cannot accept a situation where JBC is given a full rein on the application of a fundamental right whenever a person’s integrity is put to question. In such cases, an attack on the person of the applicant necessitates his right to explain himself.<br><br>The JBC’s own rules convince the Court to arrive at this conclusion. The subsequent issuance of JBC-010 unmistakably projects the JBC’s deference to the grave import of the right of the applicant to be informed and corollary thereto, the right to be heard. The provisions of JBC-010, <i>per se</i>, provide that: any complaint or opposition against a candidate may be filed with the Secretary within ten (10) days thereof; the complaint or opposition shall be <b>in writing</b>, under oath and in ten (10) legible copies; the Secretary of the Council shall furnish the candidate a copy of the complaint or opposition against him; the candidate shall have five (5) days from receipt thereof within which to file his comment to the complaint or opposition, if he so desires; and the candidate can be made to explain the complaint or opposition against him.<br><br>The Court may not close its eyes to the existence of JBC-010 which, under the rules of statutory construction, bears great weight in that: 1] it covers “any” complaint or opposition; 2] it employs the mandatory term, “shall”; and 3] most importantly, it speaks of the very essence of due process. While JBC-010 does not articulate a procedure that entails a trial-type hearing, it affords an applicant, who faces “any complaint or opposition,” the right to answer the accusations against him. This constitutes the minimum requirements of due process.<br><br><i>Application to Jardeleza’s Case</i><br><br>Nearing the ultimate conclusion of this case, the Court is behooved to rule on whether Jardeleza was deprived of his right to due process in the events leading up to, and during, the vote on the shortlist last June 30, 2014.<br><br>The JBC gives great weight and substance to the fact that it gave Jardeleza the opportunity to answer the allegations against him. It underscores the fact that Jardeleza was asked to attend the June 30, 2014 meeting so that he could shed light on the issues thrown at him. During the said meeting, Chief Justice Sereno informed him that in connection with his candidacy for the position of Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, the Council would like to propound questions on the following issues raised against him: 1] his actuations in handling an international arbitration case not compatible with public interest;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> 2] reports on his extra-marital affair in SMC; and 3] alleged insider trading which led to the “show cause” order from the Philippine Stock Exchange.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>As Jardeleza himself admitted, he declined to answer or to explain his side, as he would not want to be “lulled into waiving his rights.” Instead, he manifested that his statement be put on record and informed the Council of the then pendency of his letter-petition with the Court <i>en banc</i>. When Chief Justice Sereno informed Jardeleza that the Council would want to hear from him on the three (3) issues against him, Jardeleza reasoned out that this was precisely the issue. He found it irregular that he was not being given the opportunity to be heard per the JBC rules. He asserted that a candidate must be given the opportunity to respond to the charges against him. He urged the Chief Justice to step down from her pedestal and translate the objections in writing. Towards the end of the meeting, the Chief Justice said that both Jardeleza’s written and oral statements would be made part of the record. After Jardeleza was excused from the conference, Justice Lagman suggested that the voting be deferred, but the Chief Justice ruled that the Council had already completed the process required for the voting to proceed.<br><br>After careful calibration of the case, the Court has reached the determination that <b>the application of the “unanimity rule” on integrity resulted in Jardeleza’s deprivation of his right to due process.</b><br><br>As threshed out beforehand, due process, as a constitutional precept, does not always and in all situations require a trial-type proceeding. Due process is satisfied when a person is notified of the charge against him and given an opportunity to explain or defend himself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Even as Jardeleza was verbally informed of the invocation of Section 2, Rule 10 of JBC-009 against him and was later asked to explain himself during the meeting, these circumstances still cannot expunge an immense perplexity that lingers in the mind of the Court. What is to become of the procedure laid down in JBC-010 if the same would be treated with indifference and disregard? To repeat, as its wording provides, any complaint or opposition against a candidate may be filed with the Secretary within ten (10) days from the publication of the notice and a list of candidates. Surely, this notice is all the more conspicuous to JBC members. Granting <i>ex argumenti, </i>that the 10-day period<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> is only applicable to the public, excluding the JBC members themselves, this does not discount the fact that the invocation of the first ground in the June 5, 2014 meeting would have raised procedural issues. To be fair, several members of the Council expressed their concern and desire to hear out Jardeleza but the application of JBC-010 did not form part of the agenda then. It was only during the next meeting on June 16, 2014, that the Council agreed to invite Jardeleza, by telephone, to a meeting that would be held on the same day when a resource person would shed light on the matter.<br><br>Assuming again that the classified nature of the ground impelled the Council to resort to oral notice instead of furnishing Jardeleza a written opposition, why did the JBC not take into account its authority to summon Jardeleza in confidence at an earlier time? Is not the Council empowered to “take every possible step to verify the qualification of the applicants?” It would not be amiss to state, at this point, that the confidential legal memorandum used in the invocation of the “unanimity rule” was actually addressed to Jardeleza, in his capacity as Solicitor General. Safe to assume is his knowledge of the privileged nature thereof and the consequences of its indiscriminate release to the public. Had he been privately informed of the allegations against him based on the document and had he been ordered to respond thereto in the same manner, Jardeleza’s right to be informed and to explain himself would have been satisfied.<br><br>What precisely set off the protest of lack of due process was the circumstance of requiring Jardeleza to appear before the Council and to instantaneously provide those who are willing to listen an intelligent defense. Was he given the opportunity to do so? The answer is yes, in the context of his physical presence during the meeting. Was he given a reasonable chance to muster a defense? No, because he was merely asked to appear in a meeting where he would be, right then and there, subjected to an inquiry. It would all be too well to remember that the allegations of his extra-marital affair and acts of insider trading sprung up only during the June 30, 2014 meeting. While the said issues became the object of the JBC discussion on June 16, 2014, Jardeleza was not given the idea that he should prepare to affirm or deny his past behavior. These circumstances preclude the very idea of due process in which the right to explain oneself is given, not to ensnare by surprise, but to provide the person a reasonable opportunity and sufficient time to intelligently muster his response. Otherwise, the occasion becomes an idle and futile exercise.<br><br>Needless to state, Jardeleza’s grievance is not an imagined slight but a real rebuff of his right to be informed of the charges against him and his right to answer the same with vigorous contention and active participation in the proceedings which would ultimately decide his aspiration to become a magistrate of this Court.<br><br><b><i>Consequences</i></b><br><br>To write finis to this controversy and in view of the realistic and practical fruition of the Court’s findings, the Court now declares its position on whether or not Jardeleza may be included in the shortlist, just in time when the period to appoint a member of the Court is about to end.<br><br>The conclusion of the Court is hinged on the following pivotal points:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>There was a misapplication of the “unanimity rule” under Section 2, Rule 10 of JBC-009 as to Jardeleza’s legal strategy in handling a case for the government.<br><br></li><li>While Jardeleza’s alleged extra-marital affair and acts of insider trading fall within the contemplation of a “question on integrity” and would have warranted the application of the “unanimity rule,” he was not afforded due process in its application.<br><br></li><li>The JBC, as the sole body empowered to evaluate applications for judicial posts, exercises full discretion on its power to recommend nominees to the President. The<i> sui generis </i>character of JBC proceedings, however, is not a blanket authority to disregard the due process under JBC-010.<br><br></li><li>Jardeleza was deprived of his right to due process when, contrary to the JBC rules, he was neither formally informed of the questions on his integrity nor was provided a reasonable opportunity to prepare his defense.</li></ol></blockquote><br>With the foregoing, the Court is compelled to rule that Jardeleza should have been included in the shortlist submitted to the President for the vacated position of Associate Justice Abad. This consequence arose not from the unconstitutionality of Section 2, Rule 10 of JBC-009, <i>per se</i>, but from the <i>violation by the JBC of its own rules of procedure and the basic tenets of due process.</i> By no means does the Court intend to strike down the “unanimity rule” as it reflects the JBC’s policy and, therefore, wisdom in its selection of nominees. Even so, the Court refuses to turn a blind eye on the palpable defects in its implementation and the ensuing treatment that Jardeleza received before the Council. True, Jardeleza has no vested right to a nomination, but this does not prescind from the fact that the JBC failed to observe the minimum requirements of due process.<br><br>In criminal and administrative cases, the violation of a party’s right to due process raises a serious jurisdictional issue which cannot be glossed over or disregarded at will. Where the denial of the fundamental right of due process is apparent, a decision rendered in disregard of that right is void for lack of jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> This rule may well be applied to the current situation for an opposing view submits to an undue relaxation of the Bill of Rights. To this, the Court shall not concede. As the branch of government tasked to guarantee that the protection of due process is available to an individual in proper cases, the Court finds the subject shortlist as tainted with a vice that it is assigned to guard against. Indeed, the invocation of Section 2, Rule 10 of JBC-009 must be deemed to have never come into operation in light of its erroneous application on the original ground against Jardeleza’s integrity. At the risk of being repetitive, the Court upholds the JBC’s discretion in the selection of nominees, but its application of the “unanimity rule” must be applied in conjunction with Section 2, Rule 10 of JBC-010 being invoked by Jardeleza. Having been able to secure four (4) out of six (6) votes, the only conclusion left to propound is that a majority of the members of the JBC, nonetheless, found Jardeleza to be qualified for the position of Associate Justice and this grants him a rightful spot in the shortlist submitted to the President.<br><br><b><i>Need to Revisit JBC’s<br>Internal Rules</i></b><br><br>In the Court’s study of the petition, the comments and the applicable rules of the JBC, the Court is of the view that the rules leave much to be desired and should be reviewed and revised. It appears that the provision on the “unanimity rule” is vague and unfair and, therefore, <i>can be misused or abused resulting in the deprivation of an applicant’s right to due process.</i><br><br>Primarily, the invocation of the “unanimity rule” on integrity is effectively a veto power over the collective will of a majority. This should be clarified. Any assertion by a member <i>after </i>voting seems to be unfair because it effectively gives him or her a veto power over the collective votes of the other members in view of the unanimous requirement. While an oppositor-member can recuse himself or herself, still the probability of annulling the majority vote of the Council is quite high.<br><br>Second, integrity as a ground has not been defined. While the initial impression is that it refers to the moral fiber of a candidate, it can be, as it has been, used to mean other things. In fact, the minutes of the JBC meetings in this case reflect the lack of consensus among the members as to its precise definition. Not having been defined or described, it is vague, nebulous and confusing. It must be distinctly specified and delineated.<br><br>Third, it should explicitly provide who can invoke it as a ground against a candidate. Should it be invoked only by an outsider as construed by the respondent Executive Secretary or also by a member?<br><br>Fourth, while the JBC vetting proceedings is “<i>sui generis</i>” and need not be formal or trial type, they must meet the minimum requirements of due process. As always, an applicant should be given a reasonable opportunity and time to be heard on the charges against him or her, if there are any.<br><br>At any rate, it is up to the JBC to fine-tune the rules considering the peculiar nature of its function. It need not be stressed that the rules to be adopted should be fair, reasonable, unambiguous and consistent with the minimum requirements of due process.<br><br>One final note.<br><br>The Court disclaims that Jardeleza’s inclusion in the shortlist is an endorsement of his appointment as a member of the Court. In deference to the Constitution and his wisdom in the exercise of his appointing power, the President remains the ultimate judge of a candidate’s worthiness.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.

Aquino III</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> where we held:<br><br><blockquote>[T]he remedies of <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition are necessarily broader in scope and reach, and the writ of <i>certiorari </i>or prohibition may be issued to correct errors of jurisdiction committed not only by a tribunal, corporation, board or officer exercising judicial, quasi-judicial or ministerial functions but also to set right, undo and restrain any act of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction by any branch or instrumentality of the Government, <i>even if the latter does not exercise judicial, quasi-judicial or ministerial functions.</i> This application is expressly authorized by the text of the second paragraph of Section 1, [Article VIII of the Constitution].<br></blockquote><br>Thus, in my view, there is no procedural bar for this Court to take cognizance of this case as a proper subject of <i>certiorari</i> proceedings.<br><br>I am also convinced from my perusal of the pleadings that petitioner has come to this Court in his personal capacity and not as Solicitor General on a cause of action that accrued to him outside his employment as the government’s counsel.&nbsp; When petitioner appeared before the JBC to be considered for nomination to the vacancy in this Court, he was not representing the JBC in a legal matter but was appearing simply as a candidate for a judicial position.&nbsp; There appears to be no danger that petitioner would come by any information regarding this case to the prejudice of respondents nor would he be in a position to breach any fiduciary duty in relation to the present matter considering that respondents have chosen not to be represented by the Office of the Solicitor General and are instead represented by legal officers employed in their respective offices.<br><br><center><b><i>SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES</i></b><br></center><br><b><i>Petitioner was denied his <br>constitutional right to due process.</i></b><br><br>I am willing to grant that the JBC’s functions are not judicial such that a formal, trial-type of hearing would be not be required in the discharge of its duties.&nbsp; However, even in administrative or non-formal types of proceedings, there are minimum requirements that must be met to protect the due process rights of the persons subjected to an investigation, or in this case, an inquiry into their qualifications for judicial office.<br><br>We have held that “in administrative proceedings, the<b> filing of charges and giving reasonable opportunity for the person so charged to answer the accusations </b>against him constitute the minimum requirements of due process.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>&nbsp; The Court has also previously stated that “the observance of fairness in the conduct of any investigation is at the very heart of procedural due process.” <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>In his Concurring Opinion in Perez v. Philippine Telegraph and Telephone Company,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> our esteemed colleague Associate Justice Arturo D. Brion traced the historical development of “procedural fairness” in common law, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>At its most basic, <b>procedural due process is about fairness in the mode of procedure to be followed.</b> It is not a novel concept, but one that traces its roots in the common law principle of natural justice.<br><br>Natural justice connotes the requirement that administrative tribunals, when reaching a decision, must do so with procedural fairness. If they err, the superior courts will step in to quash the decision by <i>certiorari </i>or prevent the error by a writ of prohibition. <b>The requirement was initially applied in a purely judicial context, but was subsequently extended to executive regulatory fact-finding, as the administrative powers of the English justices of the peace were transferred to administrative bodies</b> that were required to adopt some of the procedures reminiscent of those used in a courtroom. <b>Natural justice was comprised of two main sub-rules: <i>audi alteram partem</i> - that a person must know the case against him and be given an opportunity to answer it; and <i>nemo judex in sua cause debe esse</i> - the rule against bias</b>. Still much later, the natural justice principle gave rise to the duty to be fair to cover governmental decisions which cannot be characterized as judicial or quasi-judicial in nature. (Emphases supplied; citations omitted.)</blockquote><br>To summarize, what procedural due process demands is that:&nbsp; (a) a person should have adequate notice of the charge against him; (b) he is given a reasonable opportunity to answer said charge; and (c) the proceedings to be conducted shall be free from bias.&nbsp; These are the criteria against which we shall test the procedure that the JBC applied to petitioner in the course of his candidacy to a vacancy in this Court.<br><br>In line with Section 4, Rule 1<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> of JBC-009 or the Rules of the Judicial and Bar Council, the JBC published on March 8, 2014 an announcement regarding the opening, for application or recommendation, of the position of Associate Justice of the Supreme Court in anticipation of the compulsory retirement of the Honorable Roberto A.

On June 16 and 17, 2014, former Court of Appeals Associate Justice Aurora Lagman, a JBC Regular Member, telephoned petitioner and informed him of the Chief Justice’s invocation of Section 2, Rule 10 of JBC-009 against him.&nbsp; Petitioner was further requested to “make himself available” on June 30, 2014 to appear before the JBC.<br><br>On June 24, 2014, petitioner sent a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> to the Court praying that the Court:&nbsp; (1) direct the JBC to give him at least five working days written notice of any hearing and such notice should contain the sworn specifications of the charges, sworn statements of supporting witnesses, if any, and copies of supporting documents; (2) allow petitioner to publicly cross-examine his oppositor and supporting witnesses under the same conditions as the public interviews for all applicants; (3) direct the JBC to reset the hearing scheduled for June 30, 2014; and (4) direct the JBC to disallow the Chief Justice from participating in the voting from the nominees for the position vacated by Associate Justice Roberto A. Abad.&nbsp; This letter was docketed as A.M. No. 14-07-01-SC-JBC.&nbsp; However, as discussed in the Dissenting Opinion of Justice Brion in that case, said letter was belatedly raffled on July 1, 2014 or after the June 30, 2014 JBC “hearing” and the majority of the Court resolved to merely note the letter for having become moot and academic without prejudice to any remedy petitioner may pursue.<br><br>According to the JBC Comment, this was what transpired on June 30, 2014:<br><br><blockquote>On 30 June 2014, Senior Associate Justice Antonio T. Carpio appeared as a resource person to shed light on the very confidential legal memorandum that clarifies and concretizes the integrity objection that the Chief Justice raised against petitioner, which was likewise distributed. Chief Justice Sereno emphasized that the inability to discharge the duty of the Solicitor General according to the applicable legal standards on a matter of highest importance and especially in light of the contents of the legal memorandum indicates that he does not possess the required integrity. At about 2:00 p.m. of 30 June 2014, petitioner appeared before the JBC En Banc in an Executive Session. Chief Justice Sereno told petitioner about the integrity issues raised against him and asked for his comments. The Chief Justice told him that she would give a very detailed description of the cause and nature of the objection against him, including facts. Petitioner reiterated his prayer in the aforementioned letter-petition and asked the JBC to defer its meeting, since he was expecting the Supreme Court en banc, which would be meeting the next day, to act on his letter-petition. Specifically, he demanded that the Chief Justice execute a sworn statement of her objections and that he must have the right to cross-examine her in a public hearing. He indicated that the same should also be required of Senior Associate Justice Antonio T. Carpio. Congressman Niel G. Tupas indicated that he wanted to hear for himself petitioner’s explanation but petitioner refused. He further stated that he would not be lulled into waiving his rights. He then put into record a Statement appealing that the JBC “stay their hand” that day and let the full Supreme Court address the issue of what process [is] due him.<br><br>In the afternoon of the same day, the JBC continued its deliberations and proceeded to vote for the nominees vice Supreme Court Associate Justice Abad. x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></blockquote><br>The short list of nominees released by the JBC on June 30, 2014 included Court of Appeals Justices Apolinario D. Bruselas, Jr. and Jose C. Reyes (both with six votes), Commission on Audit Chair Maria Gracia M. Pulido-Tan (five votes), and Regional Trial Court Judge Reynaldo B. Daway (four votes).&nbsp; In its Comment, the JBC admitted that petitioner garnered four votes but was not shortlisted due to the Chief Justice’s invocation of Section 2, Rule 10, JBC-009 against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>In its Comment, the JBC argues that the language of Sections 3 and 4, Rule 4 of JBC-009 was merely directory such that it was not mandatory for the JBC to give an applicant written copies of the opposition or to hold a hearing where the applicant will be allowed to cross-examine witnesses.<br><br>There is merit in petitioner’s contention that the directory language of certain provisions of JBC-009 relied upon by respondent JBC should be deemed superseded by the JBC’s subsequent issuance of JBC-10.<br><br>JBC-10 requires that names of the candidates be published and the public is informed of the deadline to file written and sworn oppositions to the candidates so named for consideration.&nbsp; Under JBC-10, it is mandatory that any opposition on whatever ground, including integrity questions, must be in writing and under oath.&nbsp; The candidate is given a copy of the opposition and a period of five days within which to respond, if he so wishes.&nbsp; There are deadlines for the filing of oppositions and the answers thereto for it is apparent on the face of JBC-10 that all submissions must be done before the interview which is a second opportunity for a candidate to address all complaints or oppositions against him <b>in a public proceeding which shall be recorded in writing.</b><br><br>It is not difficult to glean why JBC-10 requires the complaint or opposition to be in writing.&nbsp; A written complaint/opposition not only informs the candidate of the charges against him but more importantly, it limits the issues that he needs to answer to those stated in the complaint/opposition.&nbsp; This <b>prior delimitation of issues</b> is crucial to due process such that, at the public interview or any subsequent hearing to be conducted, the candidate will not be surprised by any new matter for which he has not been given an adequate opportunity to prepare his defense.&nbsp; The complaint must also be under oath not only to protect the candidate from untruthful charges but also to avoid wasting the JBC’s time investigating and evaluating frivolous complaints.&nbsp; It is presumed that only those who have meritorious complaints will file sworn statements as the threat of opening themselves to a charge of perjury would be sufficient deterrent to nuisance filings.<br><br>In the present case, petitioner was not given a copy of any written statement of the charges against him.&nbsp; The JBC stated in its Comment on page 2 that when Justice Lagman called petitioner on June 16 and 17, what was relayed to petitioner was the intention of the Chief Justice to invoke Section 2, Rule 10 of JBC-009 against him and the request to make himself available to appear before the JBC on June 30, 2014.&nbsp; In the same Comment, the JBC would clarify that earlier statement by stating that during those phone calls petitioner was informed that the integrity issue against him involved “the way he handled a very important specific case for the Republic” and that he and Justice Lagman “briefly spoke about the case.” There was also the allegation that Department of Justice Secretary Leila de Lima separately informed petitioner of the content of the Chief Justice’s objection.&nbsp; However, since these notices were verbal, there is nothing on record that will show that there was a detailed specification of the charges against petitioner during those conversations or that the opposition of the Chief Justice was sufficiently communicated to petitioner.&nbsp; Formally notifying a candidate in writing of the charges against him works for the protection of the Council as well. It is the best way for the JBC to prove that indeed there had been adequate notice to a candidate of the opposition against him.<br><br>Notably, in the JBC’s Supplemental Comment-Reply filed only on August 15, 2014 , there was an admission that the verbal advice given to petitioner through Justice Lagman and Secretary De Lima referred only to the “highly important case” that was subject of the Chief Justice’s integrity challenge raised during the June 5 and 16 deliberations.&nbsp; However, in the interim, the Chief Justice allegedly came by information regarding a “morality issue” and an issue involving stocks which she also only verbally informed petitioner of at the session held on June 30.&nbsp; This is yet another violation of petitioner’s right to due process, specifically the right to a prior delimitation of the charges against him so that he can ably prepare for his defense.<br><br>To be sure, there is no legal or logical reason to exempt an oppositor who also happens to be a member of the JBC from the requirement of setting forth his or her opposition to a candidate in writing and under oath within the time limit given to the general public and to give such candidate a fair period to respond to the opposition in writing or during his public interview as provided for in JBC-10.&nbsp; A candidate for a judicial position does not lose his constitutionally guaranteed right to due process simply because the oppositor to his candidacy is the Chair or a member of the JBC.&nbsp; Moreover, if the JBC sees fit to exempt one of its own from the application of its published rules of procedure, it becomes susceptible to an accusation of abuse of power or arbitrary exercise of discretion.<br><br>On June 30, 2014, the JBC heard the testimony of Senior Associate Justice Antonio T. Carpio as a “resource person” in support of the Chief Justice’s objection to the petitioner’s integrity.&nbsp; It would appear from the pleadings that Justice Carpio’s testimony was heard in executive session where presumably only the JBC members were present.&nbsp; The petitioner was excluded from the session and not allowed to participate.&nbsp; Afterwards, petitioner was called to appear before the JBC also in an executive session or closed-door proceeding.&nbsp; It was only at that time that the Chief Justice personally and verbally advised petitioner what her general objections were and asked petitioner to comment.&nbsp; When the petitioner declined to comment, only then did the Chief Justice verbally express that she will provide detailed facts to substantiate her objection.&nbsp; <b>Expectedly, petitioner declined to participate in that session considering that he was precisely questioning before this Court through his letter in A.M. No. 14-07-01-SC the propriety of that proceeding which suddenly deviated from the standard procedure observed by the JBC.&nbsp; He did not want to be deemed to have waived his objection to the proceeding by his active participation therein.</b><br><br>We come to the question of whether petitioner was given a fair and reasonable opportunity to be heard on June 30, 2014.&nbsp; To my mind, being told verbally on the date of the session itself what the exact charges are against him does not satisfy the demands of procedural fairness.&nbsp; The oppositor would have a distinct advantage as she has the opportunity to prepare arguments and supporting evidence on each and every charge she intends to make before the session date.&nbsp; The candidate would be effectively prevented from bringing with him documents or witnesses that may refute these charges since he would be given detailed notice of them for the first time only at the session.<br><br>Worse, it appears that petitioner was denied notice of and/or access to the evidence used against him.<br><br>A highly confidential legal memorandum that purportedly “concretizes” the integrity charge against petitioner was distributed to JBC members.&nbsp; This Court was also furnished this document through the JBC’s Comment as Annex J.&nbsp; I am hard put to find in the said document any fault attributed to the petitioner and whether it is at all proper to disclose this document.&nbsp; Did the authors and intended recipients of this highly privileged memorandum who are on a lawyer-client relationship consent to its disclosure and use as evidence in a JBC matter?<br><br>Setting aside for the moment my reservations regarding the disclosure of Annex J, I wish to point out that the issue here is not whether the oppositor presented so-called evidence on the charges made but whether the candidate was informed that this was the piece of evidence to be presented against him before the session on June 30 and whether he was given sufficient time to meet the oppositor’s evidence with his own countervailing proof.&nbsp; Even assuming this was a document that petitioner might have encountered in the course of his present employment, it did not mean that he can produce the documents and witnesses needed for his defense at a moment’s notice.<br><br>In paragraph 4, page 2 of his Reply, petitioner alleged that on June 30 he was not furnished a copy of Annex J which he came to learn was distributed to the JBC Members on said date. In paragraph 36, page 7 of the Supplemental Comment-Reply, the JBC attempts to refute this statement by claiming that indeed petitioner was served a copy of Annex J and it has the affidavit of service to prove it.&nbsp; However, the affidavit of service clearly stated that petitioner was served a copy of Annex J as part of the JBC’s Comment only on August 12, 2014.&nbsp; The material time to have provided petitioner with Annex J was before the June 30 session so that he can meet it with his own evidence at the said proceeding. Instead of refuting petitioner’s claim of lack of notice, the JBC has confirmed it.<br><br>Moving on to another point, it is true that it is discretionary on the part of the JBC to hear testimony on a complaint against a candidate but having decided to hear such testimony, procedural due process demands that the candidate at least be present to hear the substance of that testimony and for that testimony to be made part of the record.&nbsp; While it is not mandatory that the candidate be given the right to cross-examine a witness (that is, a witness other than the oppositor since Section 3, Rule 4 of JBC-009 expressly grants the candidate the right to cross-examine an oppositor), there must be an official and accurate account of that witness’s testimony which should be disclosed to the candidate.&nbsp; This disclosure should likewise be made prior to the opportunity to be heard that will be accorded to the candidate, in this case prior to the session on June 30.<br><br>Notably, there are minutes of the June 5, June 16, and June 30, 2014 JBC meetings/sessions attached to the Supplemental Comment-Reply. However, the belated submission of these minutes does not clarify anything but rather raise more questions.&nbsp; The date of the certifications gives the impression that these minutes were only prepared on August 15, 2014. This would most likely explain why these minutes were not attached to the JBC Comment filed on August 12, 2014.&nbsp; Unfortunately, disclosing these minutes only after the hearing set for petitioner’s defense serves no purpose, since the accusations against the petitioner were articulated by the oppositor Chief Justice and her witness ex parte during the closed-door meeting of the JBC. The phone calls and verbal notices from Justice Lagman and Secretary De Lima could not have fully apprised petitioner of the objections raised by the Chief Justice, which were specified in writing only in the about thirteen-page Subsection II of the JBC Supplemental Comment-Reply submitted to this Court on August 15, 2014.&nbsp; It was impossible that either Justice Lagman or Secretary De Lima could have repeated these charges completely and accurately during their conversations with petitioner prior to the June 30 session.<br><br>In fine, it is not enough that a candidate is given an opportunity to be heard. It must be a <b>real</b> opportunity to defend one’s self and not one that is merely illusory.<br><br>There is something deeply unsettling with this unprecedented procedure adopted by the JBC in petitioner’s case which was due to the unexpected invocation of Section 2, Rule 10 apparently for the first time in the history of the JBC.&nbsp; From the verbal notice of a vague, unspecific challenge against petitioner’s integrity to the conduct of closed-door executive sessions for a purpose other than deliberations on the short list, these are not authorized by the JBC rules and they even violate the avowed policy of JBC-009 and JBC-10 to promote <b>transparency </b>and <b>uniformity </b>of procedure in the JBC’s discharge of its functions.<br><br>I believe it was important for the JBC to have timely and accurately prepared the minutes of the JBC executive sessions where the charges against petitioner were proffered, provided them to petitioner and scheduled the hearing for his defense only after his receipt of these minutes, in order that the JBC might arguably be deemed to have substantially complied with procedural due process.&nbsp; As petitioner correctly points out in his Reply, having official and trustworthy written records of the proceedings of the JBC is likewise indispensable in the event that a JBC matter is brought up to this Court for review.<br><br>If the subject matter of the opposition against a candidate involves information of a highly confidential nature and divulging the privileged matter could not be avoided, would that justify dispensing with written notices, submissions and accurate records of the proceedings?&nbsp; The answer should be a resounding no.&nbsp; An individual’s constitutional right to due process cannot be sacrificed in the name of confidentiality.&nbsp; The JBC should still require a written complaint and allow the candidate reasonable time to submit a written answer if he so wishes or allow him to be heard orally at a hearing for which accurate records should be kept <b>but all submissions and records of the proceedings shall be treated with the utmost confidentiality.</b><br><br><b><i>Section 2, Rule 10 of JBC-009 does <br>not contemplate that the oppositor could be a <br>member of the JBC for that would amount to <br>an egregious conflict of interest.</i></b><br><br>As early as the dissenting opinion of Justice Brion in A.M. No. 14-07-01-SC-JBC, he had already discussed the absurdity of interpreting Section 2, Rule 10 of JBC-009 as allowing any one JBC Member the power to disqualify an applicant by his or her mere objection since in that instance unanimity can never be attained.<br><br>The inherent unfairness of the situation is not sufficiently addressed by the JBC Chair or Member-oppositor inhibiting not from the entire selection process but only from voting on the eligibility for appointment of the <b>particular candidate</b> who is the subject of his or her objection.&nbsp; The act of a JBC Member-oppositor in invoking Section 2, Rule 10 obviously prejudices the candidate objected to since a higher vote is required for such candidate to be shortlisted.&nbsp; Less obviously, the same act benefits all the other candidates vis-a-vis the candidate objected to since the other candidates who are not defending against an integrity challenge have a larger pool of JBC Members from which their votes can come and they need only a simple majority to be included in the short list.&nbsp; If the application of Section 2, Rule 10 is not a collegial decision of the JBC, it may be used by the Chair or any of its Members to prejudice or favor a particular candidate.<br><br>It is in this regard that the JBC proceedings now in question before this Court is glaringly violative of the rule against bias or one of its Latin formulations “<i>nemo debet esse judex in propria causa</i>” (literally, that no man ought to be a judge in his own cause)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> as pointed out in Justice Brion’s Concurring Opinion.<br><br>The JBC seems oblivious to the conflict of interest situation that arises when the oppositor under Section 2, Rule 10 is a member of the JBC.&nbsp; The JBC was created under the Constitution as an independent body<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> tasked with the delicate function of vetting the qualifications of applicants to judicial positions, among others.&nbsp; Although I agree with the JBC that this function cannot exactly be termed judicial or quasi-judicial, I take exception to the proposition that the Council is not engaged in fact-finding or that it need not determine the truth or falsity of an opposition against a candidate. If that is so, why does it even require objectors to swear to their opposition and submit supporting evidence? In this regard, JBC members do function similarly to impartial investigators or fact-finders who are supposed to make an unbiased recommendation on the fitness of a candidate for judicial office to the President based on a determination of relevant facts.<br><br>How could a JBC Member discharge the function of neutral fact-finder if he or she is an oppositor for one of the candidates, especially when the intention is to subject that candidate to the requirement of unanimous JBC vote unlike the others who only need a majority vote for inclusion in the short list?&nbsp; Indeed, no impartial investigator would take it upon himself or herself to complain about the manner that a candidate purportedly handled a “very important” case for the government (which incidentally is still pending resolution before the proper tribunal) when none of the persons who were intimately involved in that case have seen fit to formally oppose the candidate’s bid for nomination.&nbsp; Once a JBC member presents himself or herself as an oppositor, he or she takes on the role of an advocate who has an interest in the outcome of the voting for the vacancy that the candidate subject of the objection is being considered for.<br><br>With due respect to the Chief Justice, her role as an advocate is manifest in Subsection II of the Supplemental Comment-Reply, which was expressed to be solely attributable to her.&nbsp; Subsection II is a detailed and passionate discussion of her original integrity objection to petitioner during the June 30 session with a few additional charges in the mix, which was made known only through the JBC Supplemental Comment-Reply filed on August 15, 2014.&nbsp; May I also respectfully point out that her setting forth in writing now her very specific objections to petitioner shows that there really was nothing to prevent her from doing the same during the appropriate time which was during the call for written oppositions from the public.&nbsp; If only she had taken the time to prepare this written opposition even as late as June 24 when petitioner had requested in a letter for her to do so and given him a reasonable five-day period to answer, this matter could have been judiciously resolved well ahead of the constitutional deadline for the President to appoint.<br><br><b><i>An oppositor from the JBC should inhibit<br> from the entire selection proceedings<br>for the vacancy for which the opposed <br>candidate is being considered.</i></b><br><br>We should likewise contemplate the practical implications of allowing a JBC Member be an oppositor under Section 2, Rule 10 of JBC-009 and only inhibiting in the voting for the candidate he or she objected to.&nbsp; As a matter of practice, when the JBC submits the short list to the President the candidates are ranked by the number of votes that they gathered during the deliberation.&nbsp; This ranking is meant to indicate the strength of the JBC’s recommendation for each candidate in relation to the others on the list.&nbsp; The JBC contends that, when petitioner’s integrity was challenged and the JBC Member-oppositor inhibited from the voting on his candidacy, he should have gotten the affirmative vote of all five remaining JBC Members eligible to vote on his candidacy.&nbsp; Now, suppose he did get the unanimous vote of the non-objectors.&nbsp; In theory, that would be a perfect score.&nbsp; Should he be considered to have tied for first with the two candidates who got six out of six votes?&nbsp; Would he tie for second with the one who got five out of six votes or should he be ranked ahead of that person but behind those who got a unanimous six votes?<br><br>In all of these considerations, aside from preserving the impartiality and objectivity of the selection process, I have come to the conclusion that a JBC Member cannot be at the same time an oppositor under Section 2, Rule 10 of JBC-009.&nbsp; In fact, the clear language of the said section which requires that a candidate secure the vote of “all” the Members of the JBC, does not contemplate that an objection on a question of integrity be raised by the JBC Chair or Member.&nbsp; Otherwise, there is no need for voting.&nbsp; The oppositor’s vote is already lost.&nbsp; Nonetheless, if the JBC Chair or Member is inclined to be an oppositor, so that a candidate be subjected to the extraordinary requirement of perfect votes from the JBC, the said JBC Chair or Member must choose whether he or she wants to participate in the independent vetting of all candidates or to serve as an advocate against someone’s candidacy.&nbsp; Moreover, if the JBC Chair or Member decides to pursue his or her opposition of a candidate on the ground of integrity, then that JBC Chair or Member should (1) <b>comply with the procedural rules applicable to all oppositors</b>, and also (2) <b>inhibit from participating in the JBC proceedings and from voting for <u>all</u> candidates for that particular vacancy</b>.&nbsp; The JBC Chair or Member should be considered an ordinary oppositor and should not be given the special concession, not granted to other oppositors, of being able to lobby against the disfavored candidate even up to the deliberations and the voting on the short list.<br><br>In this manner, the JBC can fully comply with the third requisite for procedural due process, that of freedom from bias in the proceedings undertaken.&nbsp; A blanket inhibition by the JBC Chair or Member-Oppositor for the particular vacancy levels the playing field for everyone.&nbsp; Whether there is an integrity issue against a candidate or not, all candidates will vie for the same pool of votes.&nbsp; It likewise solves the problem of ranking since a unanimous vote for a candidate with an integrity challenge means exactly the same as a unanimous vote for a candidate without an integrity challenge.<br><br><b><i>Any new procedure to be implemented <br>in relation to Section 2, Rule 10 of <br>JBC-009 must be embodied in written<br> rules and published in order to<br>be valid and bind third parties.</i></b><br><br>When the JBC first issued rules of procedure via JBC-009, its intent was to set down in writing the criteria or guidelines that will govern its discharge of its constitutional mandate to recommend for appointment candidates to highly sensitive positions in government, with due regard to constitutional and statutory requirements and ensuring transparency, stability, and uniformity in its proceedings.&nbsp; The avowed policies of the JBC were further strengthened with the issuance of JBC-10 specifying in mandatory language the procedure to be undertaken by the Council.&nbsp; By issuing both sets of rules, it was the JBC itself that set the limits for the proper exercise of its functions.&nbsp; We have held that administrative regulation adopted pursuant to law has the force and effect of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; Parties dealing with the JBC have a reasonable expectation that it would follow its own published rules.<br><br>It is elementary as well that administrative regulations and issuances affecting the rights of third parties require publication to be valid. Publication is a necessary component of procedural due process to give as wide publicity as possible so that all persons having an interest in the proceedings may be notified thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>If the JBC wishes to adopt a procedure for an integrity objection under Section 2, Rule 10 of JBC-009 that is different from JBC-10, such a procedure should:&nbsp; (1) faithfully adhere to the collegial nature of the JBC; (2) comply with the basic requirements of adequate notice of the objection, ample opportunity to be heard, and freedom from bias of the proceedings; and (3) be embodied in written rules duly published in order to bind third persons. Measured against these standards, the procedure adopted by the JBC in petitioner’s case fails the test of validity.<br><br>Verily, this is a classic example of changing the rules in the middle of a game, a stratagem that is antithetical to the most elementary principles of fair play.&nbsp; The invocation of Section 2, Rule 10 of JBC-009 against petitioner being ineffectual and considering his having obtained a majority vote in favor of his nomination, petitioner should be deemed included in the short list in accordance with the proper application of the published and duly existing rules of the JBC.<br><br><b><i>There is nothing in the records of <br>this case to support the integrity <br>challenge against petitioner.&nbsp; </i></b><br><br>The issue that is determinative of this case is whether or not the proceedings before the JBC violated petitioner’s constitutional right to due process.&nbsp; However, since the Chief Justice, through the JBC Supplemental Comment-Reply, and the Dissenting Opinion insist on arguing the merits of the former’s integrity challenge against petitioner, despite the danger of compromising national interest with indiscriminate public discussions of internal matters in the Executive department, I wish to make the following observations:<br><br>A close scrutiny of Annex J and the entire records of this case will show the utter lack of evidentiary basis to support the objection on the ground of lack of integrity raised against the petitioner.<br><br>Peeling away the esoteric academic discussions on the international law case subject matter of Annex J and the innuendos regarding possible motives for the alleged minority legal opinion of petitioner, there is no proof on record that petitioner committed an act of impropriety in the handling of said case as Solicitor General or that he was pursuing selfish interests or the interests of another party in the discharge of his duties.<br><br>That petitioner was “disloyal” to the Republic is not a fact; it is but an&nbsp; opinion or conclusion, which should have been supported with facts, that is, documentary evidence and sworn testimonies or affidavits from witnesses with personal knowledge of the matter involved.&nbsp; The Chief Justice could not possibly have personal knowledge of the internal deliberations and discussions in the Executive department regarding the aforesaid international case because if she does then I would fear the erosion of the separation of powers in our government.&nbsp; Secretary De Lima, who is part of the Cabinet, would even state that she was not clear when and how the strategy complained of by the Chief Justice happened and if this was the petitioner’s idea.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; More importantly, Secretary De Lima did not question petitioner’s integrity and voted for his inclusion in the short list.&nbsp; Neither is there anything on record to independently corroborate the morality issue or the stock transaction issue which were allegedly reported to the Chief Justice.<br><br>Every law student knows that matters attested to by a person with no personal knowledge of the same shall be deemed hearsay which has no probative value.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> The Court held in <i>Jose v.

The exclusion of hearsay evidence is anchored on three reasons: (1) absence of cross-examination; (2) absence of demeanor evidence; and (3) absence of oath. Basic under the rules of evidence is that a witness can only testify on facts within his or her personal knowledge. This personal knowledge is a substantive prerequisite in accepting testimonial evidence establishing the truth of a disputed fact. Corollarily, a document offered as proof of its contents has to be authenticated in the manner provided in the rules, that is, by the person with personal knowledge of the facts stated in the document.

Jardeleza is concerned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></blockquote><br>It bears stressing here that the qualifications of competence, integrity, and probity/independence are covered by different rules under JBC-009. Only an integrity issue will trigger the higher vote requirement to secure a nomination.&nbsp; However, the JBC’s rules do not offer any definition of an integrity issue other than to obliquely refer to it as pertaining to “moral fitness.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; Consider the definition in Black’s Law Dictionary of the term:<br><br><blockquote><b>Integrity.</b> As used in statutes prescribing the qualifications of public officers, trustees, etc., this term means soundness of moral principle and character, as shown by one person dealing with others in the making and performance of contracts, and fidelity and honesty in the discharge of trusts; it is <u>synonymous with “probity</u>,” “honesty” and “uprightness.” (Underscoring supplied.)</blockquote><br>The overlapping of the conceptions of the terms integrity and probity is a matter that has grave implications in the implementation of Section 2, Rule 10 of JBC-009.&nbsp; The uncertainty and confusion that tainted the JBC’s discussions during the executive sessions on petitioner’s case behoove the JBC to definitively specify in its rules what will constitute an integrity challenge.<br><br>The JBC minutes also bear out that many of the issues touched upon in the <i>ponencia</i> and the concurring opinions already occurred to the Council’s members.&nbsp; To illustrate:<br><br><blockquote><b>From the minutes of the June 16, 2014 JBC Executive Session:</b><br><br>At this juncture, Congressman Tupas suggested a review of the JBC Rules on integrity and went on to read the provision in Rule 10, Section 2 thereof:<br><blockquote>“Sec. 2[.] <i>Votes required when integrity of a qualified applicant is challenged</i>. – In every case where the integrity of an applicant who is not otherwise disqualified for nomination is raised or challenged, the affirmative vote of all the Members of the Council must be obtained for the favorable consideration of his nomination.</blockquote>Congressman Tupas stressed since this is the first time that the Rule will be invoked, there is need to carefully examine the Rules. For instance, how many votes must a candidate garner when the affirmative vote of all Members of the Council is required under Rule 10, Sec. 2. There is also the matter of <i>who</i> can raise or challenge the integrity of an applicant: must it be raised by a Member, or can a non-Member raise or challenge under the Rule. <b>At what <i>stage</i> may the challenge on the integrity of an applicant be raised? Should there not be a need for a prior complaint or objection?</b><br><br><b>Secretary De Lima commented that the Rules do not say whether the challenge must be made by an insider or an outsider.</b> (Emphases supplied.)</blockquote><br>Yet despite the fact that the Council members failed to come to any agreement regarding these contentious issues, not the least of which was the definition of an integrity challenge, and without establishing definite parameters on how Section 2, Rule 10 of JBC-009 should be applied, the majority of the JBC Members were spurred into applying Section 2, Rule 10 to petitioner purely because it was invoked by the JBC Chair.<br><br><i><b>Two-step voting is necessary to <br>preserve the collegial character of<br>the JBC.&nbsp; </b></i><br><br>After an integrity challenge has been made in compliance with the procedural requirements under JBC-10, the JBC should take a <b>preliminary vote</b> on whether such challenge to a candidate truly involved a question of integrity based on each Council member’s appreciation of the material facts and they must determine if the issue is substantial enough to require application of Section 2, Rule 10 of JBC-009.&nbsp; The JBC should not rely on the oppositor’s characterization of his own objection as an integrity question as what happened in this case.&nbsp; The JBC should categorically decide by majority vote on the existence of a substantial integrity issue which will warrant the application of Section 2, Rule 10 to a particular candidate.&nbsp; Only then should the JBC vote on the nominations of the candidates to determine who will be shortlisted. Before the second voting, it should be clear to the JBC how many votes each candidate should garner to be nominated.<br><br>In view of the highly prejudicial effect of an integrity challenge to a candidate, my proposed <b>two-step voting procedure</b> will ensure that a majority vote is first reached on the existence of the integrity issue before the JBC will require a unanimous vote on the fitness of a specific candidate for nomination.&nbsp; During the second voting, each JBC Member is put on notice that if he or she does not vote for that candidate’s nomination it will mean exclusion of that candidate from the short list for lack of a unanimous vote. The second vote will clearly evince the intent of the non-voting member(s) to so exclude a candidate.&nbsp; Through this procedure, the JBC can avoid the pernicious situation of a minority being able to prejudice a candidate’s application on their mere manifestation that they are invoking Section 2, Rule 10 on an integrity question.<br><br><i><b><center>ON THE PRAYER FOR A<br>TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER</center></b></i><br>On this matter, suffice it to say, that I concur with the JBC that the President’s exercise of his power to fill a vacancy in this Court within the deadline is a constitutional mandate that may not be enjoined by any court.

These questions are posed in the context of <b><i>allegations of procedural infirmities</i></b> that violated an applicant’s right to due process, as well as claims of partiality in the selection process.<br><br>In resolving these questions, we must inevitably also look at<b><i> the extent of the Court’s supervisory authority over the JBC</i></b>, as well as the Court’s expanded jurisdiction under the Constitution to determine grave abuse of discretion on the part of the JBC, a governmental body.<br><br>Notably, our decision in this case <b><i>touches on matters of national interest, among them, the President’s appointment power</i></b> that must remain unfettered and to its fullest, to the extent allowed by the Constitution.

The Resolution at the same time stated that it is “<i>without prejudice to any remedy, available in law and the rules that the Solicitor General Jardeleza may still wish to pursue.”</i><br><br>I <b><i>dissented</i></b> from the Court’s<b><i> approach</i></b> in considering the letter-petition and from its <b><i>ruling,</i></b> and was joined in this Dissent by three colleagues – <b>Justices Teresita J. Leonardo -De Castro, Lucas P. Bersamin and Jose Catral Mendoza. </b> In this same Dissent, I likewise noted the peculiar timing of the receipt of the letter-petition and the resulting delay in its consideration. The presidential time limitation in exercising the power of appointment was among the issues raised during the deliberations and was a consideration in the recommendations I then made to the Court.<br><br>More than the delay and shorn of legalese, the Court simply but effectively dismissed the June 24, 2014 letter-petition. It effectively said: <i>we read your letter but what you said was not good enough as the JBC had already acted and you were too late; if you think you still have other reasons to question the JBC actions, then you are free to air them but time limitations in the President’s appointing process are your concerns.</i><br><br>In blunt Tagalog, the Court simply said: <i>“tapos na ang JBC, bahala ka na sa buhay mo!” </i> In this manner, the Court’s majority dismissively handled and brushed aside a matter of utmost importance to the President, to the Court itself and to the country.<br><br>The Court should not have only seriously considered Jardeleza’s letter (in light of the seriousness of its allegations and the matter involved) by giving it full ventilation and the opportunities that a fair hearing embodies; the Court, too, should have handled the letter-petition expeditiously given the President’s limited time to act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>In my Dissent, I stressed that the Court should have undertaken an expeditious and strictly confidential inquiry regarding Jardeleza’s allegations, with all interested parties given the opportunity to file their respective comments and memoranda.<br><br>I urged the Court to undertake this action with two things in mind: <b><i>first</i></b>, the Court – by virtue of its supervisory authority over the JBC and its expanded jurisdiction under the 1987 Constitution — has the duty to determine whether grave abuse of discretion occurred in the selection process, particularly since the JBC allegedly violated Jardeleza’s due process rights; and <b><i>second</i></b>, given the sensitive nature of the circumstances narrated in the letter-petition, as well as the 90-day deadline for the appointment of the next associate justice, questions regarding the integrity of the selection process should be addressed directly and promptly.<br><br>To my mind, the timing of the filing of the letter-petition gave the Court an opportunity to swiftly exercise its supervisory duty over the JBC, and immediately determine whether violations of the JBC’s rules and the applicant’s due process rights intervened. It was my belief that inaction, or any delay on the part of the Court in acting on the letter-petition, could possibly result in disastrous and far-ranging consequences: it could indirectly curtail the President’s appointing power, taint the JBC’s otherwise pristine reputation, affect this Court’s future composition, and prejudice an otherwise qualified applicant.<br><br>Given these considerations, I believe then, and still do now, that the letter-petition had not been mooted by the JBC’s transmittal of the shortlist of nominees to the President. In addition, the issues that the letter-petition presented are capable of repetition yet evading review: allegations of unfettered and grave abuse of discretion on the part of the JBC are capable of being repeated every time the JBC selects nominees for a vacant judicial position.

Certiorari is directed towards acts of a board or tribunal exercising quasi-judicial functions. The JBC does not exercise judicial or quasi-judicial functions; hence,<i> certiorari</i> is an improper remedy.

The JBC is not a quasi-judicial or judicial agency or fact-finding agency.

Cayosa through a certification. They likewise support a Supplemental Comment that, like the Comment, alleged facts that were not verified. Moreover, these were signed by a counsel who did not appear to have first-hand knowledge and information about the facts alleged. In short, neither the Supplemental Comment nor the Minutes are verified documents that could be considered at face value.<br><br>From these perspectives, both instruments thus take wide liberties with the rules of pleadings and evidence, in contrast with the Petition that was under oath.<br><br><b><u>Another characteristic</u></b>, already mentioned above, is that the Supplemental Comment did not expound on what the Comment had already raised or on arguments relating to the Rule 10 reservation.<br><br>Not surprisingly and following the pattern of procedural abuse that had been shown, the JBC supplement touched on completely new matters, dwelling at length with allegations about the <b>handling of an arbitration case involving the government, Jardeleza’s alleged immorality</b>, and a “show cause” order about <b>stock transaction improprieties</b>.<br><br>All these are matters that were <b><i>never discussed in the public interviews.

Per the Minutes of June 16, 2014, <b><i>at the instance of CJ Sereno</i></b>, the JBC <b><i><u>purposely did not put the challenge in writing</u></i></b> as things could be <b><i><u>“messy”</u></i></b>, to which the Secretary of Justice reportedly retorted <i>“If I know there is a challenge to my integrity that would be ground for my disqualification, then I should be given an opportunity to respond.”</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> <b><i>But this observation begs the question: respond to what challenge if the details are not provided?<br></i></b><br>Under these circumstances, it was not surprising that the petitioner, who had previously bothered to seek redress from the Supreme Court and whose June 24, 2014 letter-petition was then unacted upon, did not immediately answer objections whose scope and details he did not know about.<br><br>In sum, this characteristic, as the first one did, took a lot of liberties and stretched procedural rules beyond their breaking point.<br><br>A <b><u>third characteristic</u></b> of the JBC Supplemental Comment is that it embodied positions from the Chief Justice that she could no longer, <b><i>on her own,</i></b> introduce into this case as she had effectively surrendered her right to comment by <b><i><u>not filing one</u> when and as required by her own Court.</i></b> To be sure, her Court position alone does not entitle her to disregard the periods set by the Court, nor entitle her to file her pleadings at her leisure.<br><br><b><u>D.2. <i>Other Important Concerns</i></u></b><br><br><blockquote><u>D.2.a. Basic Lack of Sensitivity to Fairness &amp; Due Process</u></blockquote><br><b><u>To top all the above characteristics and to Jardeleza’s great prejudice</u></b>, the JBC dwelt with matters that <i>Jardeleza could no longer controvert in this case without risking the lapse of the presidential time limit on appointments to the Supreme Court.</i><br><br>Additionally, the terms of this Supplemental Comment are, on their faces, <b><i>sickening</i></b> as they are no less than daggers used in a character assassination made in the guise of a Supplemental Comment. Expressly, it alleged that Jardeleza had been “disloyal to the country.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> The Supplemental Comment also <b><i>laid bare</i></b> aspects of the government arbitration case that <b><i>no responsible government official, more so if she is Chief Justice, would so openly discuss.</i></b><br><br>To be sure, to be called disloyal to one’s country is no laughing matter that one can easily brush aside and forget. At the very least, it is a career-killer, not to mention the personal stigma it leaves on one’s person, family and all past accomplishments.<br><br>What elevates this charge <b><i>to the level of malice</i></b> is that it appears to have been <b><i>purposely timed</i></b> to be embodied in the Supplemental Comment at the stage of the case when it could no longer be refuted. Those who have read Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar can readily appreciate that Jardeleza can now very rightly say: <b><i>Et tu, Chief Justice who should be the chief guardian of people’s personal rights through the due process clause?</i></b><br><br>Understandably perhaps, the Comment does not appreciate fairness and due process and even refutes their consideration; the case allegedly does not involve life, liberty or property so that even the concept of fairness cannot apply.<br><br>This approach makes one wonder what the terms “integrity” and “reputation” mean to the respondents, and if they realize that libel is penalized because reputation and integrity are precious treasures that people value; they are in fact<b><i> treasures that live beyond us and are not interred with our bones.</i></b><br><br>For these reasons, I see no need to dwell on and discuss the <b><i>substantive merits </i></b>of the causes alleged to support the disqualification of Jardeleza, and will only focus on the process involved and their internal or procedural contradictions. I refuse to take part in character assassination by dignifying the belatedly cited grounds with a discussion of their substantive merits.<br><br><b>D.2.b. <u><i>Irresponsible Actions</i></u></b><br><br>I do not share, too, CJ Sereno’s view that we can discuss and be judgmental about a matter that wholly lies within Executive domain and whose public discussion at this point may work to the prejudice and detriment of the country. The Judiciary has no business passing judgment, however informally, on internal developments within the Executive Department, a coordinate and co-equal branch, unless the developments are facts in issue in a case. Even in the latter case, we should particularly be careful in our actions when these actions may possibly entail risk to the national interests.<br><br>If the Chief Justice is adventurous enough to take such risks, then this Opinion and like actions from individual Justices of this Court, will at least signal to the Executive and to the nation that <b><i>the Court itself as an institution does not share the Chief Justice’s views.</i></b><br><br>If indeed she had an awareness of the sensitivity of the matters brought up to the level of the JBC, she should have taken measures and safeguards to ensure their confidentiality, or, must have at least consulted with the offices concerned on how best to handle possible national interest concerns. Ironically, as events in this case unfolded, <b><i>she even initiated the full exposition</i></b> in the Supplemental Comment of matters that may possibly involve national interest risks.<br><br><b>If for this reason alone, the whole Supplemental Comment and its attachments, including the Minutes, should be placed on media and third party embargo, and stricken off the records of this case</b><br><br><b>D.3. <i><u>The Petition for Intervention</u></i></b><br><br>A twist at this late stage of this case is the <b>Comment in Intervention</b>, allegedly filed by Atty. Purificacion S. Bartolome-Bernabe (who described herself as President of the Bulacan IBP Chapter). Unfortunately, the petition contained nothing new, significant or substantial, and simply parroted the positions in the JBC’s own Comment and Supplemental Comment. In this light and at this stage of the present case, denial of the proposed intervention should be proper.<br><br><b>E. <i><u>Jardeleza’s Reply and its Factual Aspects.</u></i></b><br><br>a.&nbsp; To support his contention that CJ Sereno purposely excluded him, Jardeleza firstly stressed that on June 16 and 17, 2014, he received a call from J. Lagman that CJ Sereno wanted him to “make himself ‘available’ and to appear before them on June, 30 2014; and that the Chief Justice would invoke Section 2, Rule 10 of JBC-009 to question his integrity.” J. Lagman stated without detail that the objections had to do with his work as Solicitor General, and that the Chief Justice would inform him of her objections to his integrity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>This is a critical point and is one that, to some extent, the original JBC Comment actually conceded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> At page 7 of the same JBC Comment, it adds the statement that “<i>he and Justice Lagman spoke briefly about the case and his general explanation for how he handled the same. He agreed to explain himself on the matter. Secretary De Lima also separately informed the petitioner about the content of the impending Rule 10 objection against him on said date.”</i><br><br>No dispute appears that the JBC gave Justice Lagman the task of talking to Jardeleza about the Section 2, Rule 10 objection against him. The submitted Minutes made reference to this deputation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> and likewise generally mentioned what the topic of the queries would be.<br><br>What the Minutes and the JBC Comment <b>did not mention,</b> however, were the details of what J. Lagman relayed to Jardeleza,<i> i.e.</i>, <b>the <i>specific points</i> of the integrity objection and the inquiry to be made</b>. There was likewise no mention of a separate contact by Secretary De Lima to Jardeleza to make her own notification.<br><br>An examination of the Minutes shows that <b>no detailed discussion</b> was made on June 5 and 16, 2014 of the specifics of the Chief Justice’s objection. <b><i>In fact, it was not until June 30 when J. Carpio was invited as resource speaker that he fully explained these details to the JBC members</i>.</b><br><br>Thus, J. Lagman could not have been specific enough about the details when she invited Jardeleza to the June 30, 2014 meeting, for her invitation to serve as a sufficient notice alerting Jardeleza to what he was to fully answer at the coming meeting.<br><br>If logic and common experience would be the standards, it is more believable that J. Lagman simply<b> <i>generally</i></b> referred to the factual and legal bases for the objection, and in fact further said that CJ Sereno would explain the details to Jardeleza at the June 30, 2014 meeting.<br><br>From the perspective of strict legality, J. Lagman’s phone call and invitation to Jardeleza on June 16 and 17, 2014, cannot therefore serve as a notice sufficient for due process purposes. Jardeleza was invited to come and was only generally informed that there would be an objection against his integrity. As further discussed below, despite his subsequent June 24, 2014 letter to the Court and to CJ Sereno, he was not informed of the details of the objection and was <b><i>more in the dark rather than informed and enlightened</i></b>, when he attended the June 30, 2014 JBC meeting.<br><br>b.&nbsp; Before the June 30, 2014 meeting, Jardeleza made no secret of his concerns and, in fact, requested specific reliefs, among them the specification of the objections against him and the sworn statements of the witnesses. This was embodied in Jardeleza’s June 24, 2014 letter-petition to the Court <b><i>with copies to all members of the JBC.</i></b> This aspect of the case is not disputed. What lie in the shadows are the <b>implications</b> of this letter.<br><br>At the very least, it cannot be denied that at least five days before the June 30, 2014 meeting, the JBC members were already aware that Jardeleza was already demanding that he be given specific details of the charges/objections against him. Yet, no concern from the JBC members was raised about the need for specific details at the June 30, 2014 meeting; it was only Jardeleza himself who brought the matter up in the context of asking for a deferment of the June 30, 2014 meeting.<br><br>Apparently, nothing was raised about specific details as the matter had been settled during the previous June 16, 2014 meeting: <b><i>nothing would be in writing because to take this step would be “messy.”</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>In effect, the JBC sought to undertake a shortcut: what it had in mind, as influenced by CJ Sereno, was to simply inform Jardeleza of the details of the Section 2 Rule 10 objection to his application on June 30, 2014, and right then and there ask him to answer questions regarding his integrity.<br><br>Would a seasoned lawyer, now an applicant to a vacancy in the Highest Court – <b><i>with years of private law practice and academic teaching experiences behind him, and who acts as counsel representing the government in a pending arbitration case of national importance</i></b> – reply to an <b><i>open-ended charge without specifications of its particulars</i></b>? I think not.<br><br>c.&nbsp; The matter of the service of <b>Annex “J”</b> on Jardeleza is another disturbing aspect of this case. Jardeleza denied that he received a copy of Annex “J” which is a letter from a counsel relating to the government arbitration case.<br><br>My own records show that I received the August 11, 2014 JBC Comment with attached Annexes “A” to “I,” and a separate envelope containing Annex “J.” What happened in my case does not necessarily mean, however, that the same thing happened to Jardeleza.<br><br>In the first place, why was Annex “J” placed in a separate envelope when it was intended as an integral part of the Comment? Was it selectively served on the parties and was not served on Jardeleza as he claimed? When was this Annex, in fact, given to the JBC members – was it only at the June 30 meeting as the Minutes indicate?<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>I ask these questions in light of the pattern of manipulation that has become apparent in this case. Is this another one of them? To be sure, I am not ready to accept that Jardeleza received a copy of the separately-enveloped Annex “J” in the absence of independent proof that the separate envelope was separately served and received.<br><br>In other words, I do not believe that proof of receipt of the JBC Comment can serve as proof of receipt of the separately-enveloped Annex “J”. “Sharp” practitioners have been known in the past to resort to the underhanded technique of serving and asking for the receipt of envelopes with nothing inside them. This could be a variation of this sharp technique and could have happened under the warped circumstances of this case.<br><br><b><u>F. <i>The JBC’s Supplemental Comment and its Factual Aspects</i></u></b><br><br>a. The Supplemental Comment opens with an alleged “more detailed and chronologically arranged restatement of relevant facts.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> As I have stated above, most of these are simply new matters that have no place in a “supplement” for the reasons likewise already stated above.<br><br>b. The second point the Supplemental Comment raised is a disclaimer on why it is disclosing “sensitive national interest matters.” The reason given is – <b><i>“because the Petitioner himself challenges the JBC to a public and open discussion of the integrity issue against him…the JBC, to protect its reputation, and under the legal compulsion of candor before this Honorable Court, has no recourse but to disclose the facts…”</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>This disclaimer was followed by a recital,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> <b><i><u>attributed to CJ Sereno</u></i></b>, of internal matters in the arbitration case. I do hope the attribution and the statements are wrong as no Chief Justice or even a Judge or Justice should ever claim the flimsy excuse imputed to her. I ask: if indeed the JBC and the Chief Justice knew of the sensitivity of the issue to the nation, are their given reasons sufficient for the disclosures they made?<br><br>Given that disclosures had been made, I believe that the best recourse for this Court under the circumstances, is as I proposed above: <b><i>embargo the Supplemental Comment and its Annexes, including the disputed Annex “J,” and strike them off from the records of the case.</i></b><br><br>c.&nbsp; Paragraphs 21 and 22 of the Supplemental Comment are interesting because they lay the basis for the allegations of Jardeleza’s immorality and insider trading.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Apparently referring to paragraph 21 (the calls of J. Lagman to Jardeleza) as basis, paragraph 22 –which was <b><i>again attributed to CJ Sereno</i></b> – stated that the JBC might as well look into these allegations. The problem though is that J. Lagman does not appear to have ever informed Jardeleza of these grounds as basis for the integrity objection against him. The Minutes, to be sure, do not reflect any such communication, much less its details.<br><br>d.&nbsp; Both from the Minutes and the Supplemental Comment, it appears clear that J. Carpio did not appear either as oppositor or as complainant; he was simply invited by the JBC, through the Chief Justice, to explain matters to the Council. <b><i>Nor does it appear that he ever spoke in the presence of Jardeleza and that he was ever questioned by Jardeleza about the integrity objection.</i></b><br><br>All these narrations go to show that Jardeleza was never ever fully informed of what objection had been laid against him. On June 30, 2014, he was simply asked to answer general claims with no specification of details – something that no lawyer representing the government in a sensitive national issue and who is worth the title Attorney, would off-handedly answer.<br><br>In short, what he faced was a vague charge that the JBC made,<b><i> at the initiative of CJ Sereno, </i></b>hoping that Jardeleza would be intimidated and would withdraw as indicated by the Minutes of the June 16 meeting, or that he would blindly answer as indicated in the Minutes of the June 30 meeting.<br><br>Neither possibility materialized and so Jardeleza now stands libeled under the charge of being disloyal to the country, and denied, quite possibly, of the chance to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court – all because of moves pointedly aimed at preventing him from reaching this Court, seemingly at all costs.<br><br><b><center><u>II. <i> Procedural and Legal Issues</i><br></u></center></b><br>A. <b><i><u>The Court’s power of supervision over the JBC</u></i></b><br><br>The JBC functions as a collegial body that recommends to the President a shortlist of nominees for vacant judicial positions, from which list the President then chooses his appointee. It is a constitutional body created under the 1987 Constitution to replace the highly-political process of judicial appointments in the past, and was meant to make the selection process more competence-based. It also seeks to shield the judiciary from political pressure from the other branches of government. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>To partly quote the wording of the Constitution, Article VIII, Section 8(1) and (5) provide that “A Judicial and Bar Council is hereby created under the supervision of the Supreme Court… It may exercise such other functions and duties as the Supreme Court may assign to it.”<br><br><b><i>Supervision, as a legal concept</i></b>, has been defined as the power of oversight, or the authority to see that subordinate officers perform their duties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> It involves ensuring that the law or the rules governing the conduct of a government body or subordinate officer are followed. Supervising officials merely see to it that the rules are followed, but they themselves do not lay down these rules, nor do they have the discretion to modify or replace them. If the rules are not observed, they may order the work done or redone, but only to conform to the rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Following this definition, the Court’s supervisory authority over the JBC is to see to it that the JBC follows its own rules. Thus, when there are allegations regarding the JBC’s non-compliance with its own rules, especially when it comes from an applicant who is in the position to know of these infirmities, then the Court, through its supervisory authority over the JBC, has the duty to inquire about the matter and ensure that the JBC complies with its own rules.<br><br>In the present case, Jardeleza came to know of JBC’s actions and perceived these to be procedurally infirm because he had been kept in the dark about their details. He consequently feared for his chance and opportunity to intelligently answer the charges or objections that could be laid against him. Thus, he came to this Court, asking for the enforcement of the JBC rules as his relief. His allegation of supporting facts and invocation of the JBC rules, generally undenied in the JBC’s Comment, are sufficient to trigger further inquiry from this Court into the JBC’s actions.<br><br><b>B. <i><u>The Court’s constitutional duty to determine grave<br>abuse of discretion under its expanded jurisdiction</u></i></b><br><br>The present petition unequivocably imputes grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction to the JBC and CJ Sereno, and thus invokes the Court’s expanded jurisdiction under the 1987 Constitution.<br><br>As I have noted in several cases in the past, the 1987 Constitution granted the Court an expanded jurisdiction to determine whether grave abuse of discretion had been committed by a government agency or instrumentality, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>Section 1. The judicial power shall be vested in one Supreme Court and in such lower courts as may be established by law.<br><br>Judicial power includes the duty of the courts of justice to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable, and to determine <b><i>whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction</i></b> on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government.</blockquote><br>Under these terms, the present Constitution not only integrates the <b>traditional definition of judicial power</b>, but introduces as well a <b>completely new expanded power </b>to the Judiciary under the last phrase — “to determine whether or not there has been <b><i>a grave abuse of discretion</i></b> amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of <b><i>any branch or instrumentality of the Government</i></b>.”<br><br>Under this expanded judicial power, justiciability <b><i>expressly</i></b> and<b><i> textually</i></b> depends <b><i>only </i></b>on the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion, as distinguished from a situation where the issue of constitutional validity is raised within a “traditionally” justiciable case which demands that the requirement of actual controversy based on specific legal rights must exist. Notably, <i>even if the requirements under the traditional definition of judicial power are applied,</i> these requisites are complied with once grave abuse of discretion is<i> prima facie </i>shown to have taken place. <b><i>The presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion is the justiciable issue to be resolved.</i></b><br><br>Rule 65 of the Rules of Court reflects the traditional jurisdiction of the Court, and thus requires that a petition for <i>certiorari </i>be directed towards a judicial or quasi-judicial act. Jurisprudence after the 1987 Constitution’s enactment, however, has repeatedly invoked the Court’s expanded jurisdiction – <i>albeit </i>without expressly naming it – by carving out exceptions on the requirements for justiciability. Recent cases, however, have been more cognizant of the Court’s expanded jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Thus, through its practices, the Court has allowed the use of <i>certiorari</i> as a remedy to invoke the Court’s expanded jurisdiction to determine whether grave abuse of discretion had been committed. The Court has so acted regardless of whether the assailed act is quasi-judicial or not.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>In these lights, I do not find the JBC’s argument that Jardeleza availed of the wrong remedy to be persuasive; Jardeleza’s petition invoked the Court’s expanded jurisdiction, not its traditional jurisdiction.<br><br>To successfully invoke the Court’s expanded jurisdiction, the petitioner must <i>prima facie </i>show that the assailed act constitutes grave abuse of discretion by any branch or instrumentality of government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> In my view, Jardeleza complied with this requirement with his narration of the facts that transpired during the selection process <i>vis-a-vis</i> the JBC Rules of Procedure, which allegations the JBC did not essentially contradict.<br><br>Notably, Jardeleza has not been lukewarm in asserting his right to due process; he has been very consistent in pushing for the implementation of the JBC rules in his case. He did this in his June 24, 2014 letter-petition to this Court. He repeated this in the position he took and his statement before the JBC on June 30, 2014. He has reiterated these positions in his present petition.<br><br><b><i><u>In sum, the Court exercises two points of entry in assuming jurisdiction over the present petition. The first is its supervision over the JBC, while the second is the exercise of its expanded judicial power. Both of these powers are constitutional in nature.</u></i></b><br><br><b>C. <b><i><u>The Violation of Jardeleza’s right to due process. </u></i></b> </b><br><br>In its Comment, the JBC emphasized that under its rules, it has full discretion to conduct a discreet investigation on the background of judicial applicants. This discretion includes, by its account, the authority to determine whether the hearing of oppositors’ testimonies and the submission by applicants of written comments on the opposition to them, are necessary.<br><br>The JBC downplayed these requirements – whose absence Jardeleza claims to be violative of his rights – and noted that it is not a quasi-judicial nor a judicial body concerned with the applicant’s guilt or innocence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> In any case, the JBC claimed that it gave Jardeleza the opportunity to be heard on June 30, 2014 but he refused this opportunity as he instead insisted on his claimed procedural rights.<br><br><b><i>Under these conflicting claims, the case before us largely becomes a due process matter: is Jardeleza entitled to due process and, if so, was he denied his rights?</i></b><br><br><blockquote><b>C.1. <i><u>Procedural due process applies to the JBC’s governmental action of excluding Jardeleza from the shortlist of nominees</u></i></b></blockquote><br>As earlier discussed, the JBC is a novel creation under the 1987 Constitution, which replaced the confirmation process that members of the judiciary previously had to undergo after appointment. The 1987 Constitution gave the JBC the task of selecting and submitting a shortlist of nominees (composed of at least three men and/or women of proven competence, independence, probity and integrity) from where the President can choose the judge or justice he will appoint.<br><br>But unlike other constitutional bodies whose functions have been enumerated by the Constitution, the Constitution did not lay down in exact terms the process the JBC shall follow in determining applicants’ qualifications. In this sense, the JBC is <i>sui generis;</i> the process it shall follow is entirely left for its determination ? essentially a grant of quasi-legislative power. This rule making power is at the same time plenary, subject only to the supervisory authority of the Supreme Court, to the constitutional provisions recognizing the fundamental rights of individuals, and to higher constitutional principles such as checks and balances in government, among others.<br><br>In other words, the uniqueness and novelty of the JBC’s selection process give it ample but not unbridled license to act in performing its duties. <b><i>It cannot conduct its proceedings in violation of individual fundamental rights or other provisions of the Constitution.</i></b><br><br>For this reason, I cannot agree with the JBC’s contention that the investigative nature of the selection process automatically means that the due process rights of applicants cannot be invoked against it. <b><i>As a body vested with governmental functions, it interacts with, and its actions affect, individuals whose rights must be considered.</i></b><br><br>To determine whether these interactions should involve procedural due process rights, the United States Supreme Court (whose Bill of Rights rulings we use as non-binding guides) use the balancing of interests approach developed in <i>Mathews v. Elridge</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Due process, unlike some legal rules, is not a technical conception with a fixed content unrelated to time, place and circumstances. Due process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands. <b><i>Accordingly, resolution of the issue whether the administrative procedures are constitutionally sufficient requires analysis of the governmental and private interests that are affected.</i></b> More precisely, identification of the specific dictates of due process generally requires consideration of three distinct factors: <b><i>First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used</i></b>, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and <b><i>finally, the government's interest</i></b>, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail xxx<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></blockquote><br>This test, applied to the accusations of a JBC member against the integrity of Jardeleza, shows that procedural due process should have been made available.<br><br>The private interest affected by the JBC’s actions involve <b><i>Jardeleza’s inclusion in the shortlist of nominees</i></b> and his opportunity to become part of this Court. That Jardeleza’s inclusion in the list gives him a mere opportunity to become a Supreme Court Justice does not minimize this interest, as the surrounding circumstances show that he was a strong contender for appointment: despite the accusations against him, Jardeleza still gained the four votes necessary for inclusion in the shortlist. Further, the Comment of the Executive Secretary, a party to this case as the alter ego of the President, prayed that Jardeleza be included in the list.<br><br><b><i>Most importantly, the JBC’s actions massively, but negatively, affected Jardeleza’s reputation as a lawyer, as a private individual and as a citizen.</i></b><br><br>Involved here is a reputation built up over the years as an outstanding student, a preeminent law practitioner, and a high ranking government official now officially representing no less than the Government. Jardeleza’s non-inclusion in the list – despite being considered by many as a strong contender, taken together with the statement from the Court’s Public Information Office announcement that there should have been five nominees, had it not been for an invocation of Rule 10, Section 2 of JBC-009 – cannot but signal doubts about Jardeleza’s integrity. That Jardeleza was the excluded nominee had been confirmed by subsequent judicial proceedings before this Court, that has been the subject of media attention through various articles speculating on his integrity.<br><br>Thus, the JBC’s failure to apply procedural due process has prejudiced Jardeleza’s private interest: he was excluded from the shortlist of nominees, to the prejudice of his reputation and despite the required majority votes he garnered. Conceivably, the accusation against him – if left unresolved – would also affect his continued stay in his post as Solicitor General since the media continues to speculate on the matter. Further inaction from this Court would further taint Jardeleza’s reputation, given the allegations already made at the JBC and in these proceedings.<br><br>As pointed out in the Prefatory Statement, many other interests are affected by the actions of the JBC.<b><i> An erroneous application of the JBC selection rules indirectly limits the President’s appointment choices and thus restricts the President’s appointing authority. </i></b>An erroneous application can likewise affect the <b><i>composition of this Court</i></b> and, under the facts of this case, possibly the values this institution stands for.<br><br>The JBC itself benefits by implementing procedural safeguards, such as the interpretation of its rules to consciously implement the rudiments of procedural due process, or at the very least in the present case, by giving Jardeleza a meaningful opportunity to be heard and address the accusations against him. The Judiciary under whose umbrella the JBC exists likewise benefits. <b><i>Overall, these safeguards increase transparency and credibility of the selection process and produce greater belief in the independence of the judiciary as an institution.</i></b><br><br>Not to be overlooked in implementing safeguards are the burdens that the JBC must undertake and that procedural due process may entail. All these must be weighed against the JBC’s benefits and the private and other interests affected.<br><br>The JBC, to be sure, operates under constraints under its duty to submit a shortlist of nominees: the Constitution requires the President to appoint within 90 days from occurrence of the vacancy and he cannot fulfill this duty unless he receives the JBC shortlist. The JBC, too, cannot haphazardly act and must thoroughly examine its nominees to ensure that they possess the required qualifications for membership in the judiciary.<br><br>Providing an applicant who has passed the initial screenings and who has in fact secured sufficient votes to be nominated, with the opportunity to meaningfully defend himself from accusations against his integrity, would not have been too much of a burden on the JBC sufficient to adversely affect its actions within the required 90-day appointment period.<br><br>Based on the facts of the case, the deadline to transmit the shortlist is a reasonable time before the President’s own deadline of August 20, 2014. Even assuming that the accusation against Jardeleza materialized only sometime after the public interview (or on June 5, 2014 at the latest under the facts of the submitted Minutes), the JBC had more than a month to inform Jardeleza of the accusations against him and to confront him about it under due process safeguards. This, unfortunately, was not done although this course of action is fully in line with the JBC’s interest to submit properly vetted and qualified nominees, and promote transparency and accountability in the selection process.<br><br><b>C.2. <i>Procedural due process as </i></b><br><b><i>applied in the case requires </i></b><br><b><i>fairness</i></b><br><br>How could and should the JBC have met the requirement of procedural due process in the present case?<br><br>Procedural due process is a flexible concept, and the required safeguards and procedures to ensure it may change based on the nature of the case and the attendant facts. But at the heart of procedural due process is <b><i>fairness</i></b>, as embodied in its most basic requirements: <b><i>the meaningful opportunity to be heard (audi alteram partem) by an impartial decision-maker (nemo judex in parte sua)</i></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Due process, as it originated from England, embodied these two interlocking principles, which ultimately prohibits partiality and fosters impartiality.<br><br>As the JBC selection process is a <i>sui generis</i> proceeding, no existing jurisprudential standard can definitively be used as judicial precedent for the due process required in the selection process. But, at the very least, the most rudimentary aspect of procedural due process should apply: there should be meaningful opportunity to present one’s case and the consideration must be made by an impartial judge.<br><br>Unfortunately, neither of these aspects had been observed in the present case. On the contrary, what appears from the records on a collective reading of seemingly disparate incidents, is a determined effort to discredit Jardeleza’s integrity without giving him the benefit of impartial consideration.<br><br><b>C.3. <i>Jardeleza was not given a<br>meaningful opportunity to be heard</i></b><br><br>The opportunity to be heard, in order to be truly meaningful, must in the first place involve due notification of what the charge or objection is. The charge or objection is the <b><i>reckoning point</i></b> from where the party to be heard will base his own position.<br><br>In the present case, this reckoning point is nowhere to be found as the notification, if the phone calls by J. Lagman can be so characterized, was effectively only a summons to a hearing with which Jardeleza complied. As I pointed out above, J. Lagman, who phoned Jardeleza, could not in fact fully state the exact objection because she was also only fully briefed about it on June 30, 2014, when J. Carpio came to explain.<br><br>Bothered by what was happening and fearing a <b>Star Chamber </b>inquiry (to borrow an <b><i>Inquirer</i></b> editorial allusion), Jardeleza came to this Court and asked for help. Pointedly he asked in his June 24, 2010 letter: <b><i><u>what exactly is the objection about?</u></i></b><br><br>In my view, it is not enough to say that it is an integrity objection and simply point to the portion of the JBC rules on integrity objections. Even a general idea of what the matter would not be enough under the facts of the present case where Jardeleza is the Solicitor General directly acting on an arbitration case that is still pending. Responding to unspecified charges could only open up a lot of things within the limitations of lawyer-client relationship and the pendency of the case. The matter becomes more complicated if the case indeed involves national security or national interest considerations. Overall, what one could or would say, had to be carefully weighed and considered.<br><br>In the considerations of the parties’ submissions, I examined all the given facts, although I also posited that the Supplemental Comment should be stricken from the records of the case. But even if I were to fully consider the Supplemental Comment, I would still have the same conclusion, even made stronger in my mind by the seemingly disparate incidents that collectively point to a concerted and focused drive to exclude Jardeleza from the nomination list. <b><i>Indeed from the seat of power and control, one may manipulate events with facility so that the moving hand remains unseen</i></b>. But over time and when the dots are inevitably connected to one another, the pattern will show, as that pattern had been shown in the examination made above.<br><br>To point the obvious ones, <b><i>first,</i></b> the objection was not made at the earliest opportunity to give the JBC, as a body, full consideration of the objection. It was <b><i>raised at the last moment </i></b>when the short list was already being considered, using a provision of the JBC rules that is being invoked for the first time.<br><br><b><i>Second,</i></b> it was apparently raised after a hidden campaign to exclude Jardeleza must have failed at the JBC, <i>i.e</i>., after it became obvious that Jardeleza would get the required votes unless an overt objection was made. Note in this regard that <b><i>even the Supreme Court appeared to have been manipulated when it was not given the chance to vote for its recommendees</i></b>. Apparently, Jardeleza would have made, if not topped, the list of Court recommendees since the Members of the Court have seen him in action during the oral arguments, have read his pleadings, and collectively have a very high respect for the Solicitor General’s handling of the Reproductive Health, the PDAF and the DAP cases, where he conducted a very creditable (although losing) presentation of the government’s case.<br><br><b><i>Third,</i></b> the JBC obviously and even by admission, shied away from any written specification of the grounds for objection, only for CJ Sereno to come up with, not only one, but three grounds to clinch the exclusion she wanted.<br><br>Note that as early as June 5, 2014 she already expressed the intent to use a Section 2, Rule 10 objection – a first in the history of the JBC. Nothing was done however to fully specify what the objections were, or to provide for safeguards if the ground indeed should be highly confidential.<br><br>Very easily, the notification could have been a confidential but written one, shared only among the JBC members and Jardeleza. The opportunity to do this was present up to the meeting of June 16, 2014, but still the JBC, apparently with the guidance of CJ Sereno, sought the verbal route. Why the telephone calls could not have served as an effective notice has been discussed above and need not be repeated here.<br><br><b><i>Fourth</i></b>, matters came to a head when Jardeleza, instead of being cowed and intimidated into inaction or surrender, chose to meet the situation head-on by writing the Supreme Court his June 24, 2014 letter-petition.<br><br>Receipt of the letter-petition by the Court (and soon after, by the Justices) came on June 25, 2014. Yet surprisingly, this was never acted upon, and was not even raffled to a Member-in-Charge until 30 minutes before <i>en banc</i> time a day after the June 30, 2014 JBC meeting.<br><br>This type of delayed action, to my mind, showed the intent to manipulate, as an early raffle could have precipitated an urgent recommendation to issue a temporary restraining order, as had been done in previous cases when time was of the essence in important matters and cases. Indeed, it is intriguing that the raffle was made on the day after the June 30, 2014 JBC meeting that resulted in a shortlist of nominees when moot and academic ruling could be very tempting.<br><br><b><i>Fifth</i></b>, what apparently threw a monkey wrench in the plan to easily get the June 24, 2014 letter-petition out of the way, was the recommendation of the initial Member-in-Charge, not to simply NOTE the letter and not to enter a “moot and academic” ruling, but to ask the parties to comment in order to conduct a quiet but speedy investigation.<br><br>At that point, objections at the <i>En Banc</i> were made, resulting in a majority ruling to NOTE the letter without prejudice to any action Jardeleza might take. This was of course a move that already rose to the level of malice, as time was of the essence in acting on the matter; the regular and formal <i>certiorari </i>process alone would have eaten up precious time on the part of the appointing authority.<br><br>Still relying on judicial processes, Jardeleza dutifully filed his petition on July 18, 2014 or about a month away from the President’s August 20, 2014 deadline. The Court acted on the petition in its July 22, 2014 Resolution by requiring the parties to comment within a non-extendible period of ten days.<br><br>Surprise of surprises, this simple unsigned Court Resolution that could be prepared from a template was not issued until August 1, 2014, thus again eating up a good portion of the President’s precious appointing time.<br><br><b><i>Sixth</i></b>, the JBC filed its Comment at the last minute of the last hour of the deadline, August 11, 2014 or a day before the en banc meeting of August 12, 2014. <b><i>A copy of the Comment was given to the Member-in-Charge about 30 minutes from en banc time:</i></b> how could the Member-in-Charge meaningfully consider the Comment under this time constraint?<br><br>Significantly, CJ Sereno, a separate respondent, did not file any comment despite the <b><i>non-extendible </i></b>period given. The catch was in the prayer of the Comment that asked for a supplement where, as events unfolded, the full blast of CJ Sereno’s case was disclosed. At that time, Jardeleza could hardly be given time to respond to the new matters alleged in the supplement as it was already August 15, 2014 – the Friday before the last<i> En Banc </i>session on August 19, 2014; the President’s limited time expires the next day, August 20, 2014.<br><br><b>C.4. <i>The JBC’s impartiality in resolving<br>the integrity objection against Jardeleza<br>is doubtful</i></b><br><br>The facts, as derived from the pleadings, also raise questions about the JBC’s impartiality as shown by the manner it handled the objections against Jardeleza’s integrity.<br><br><b><i><u>First</u></i></b>, Jardeleza’s oppositor was CJ Sereno, who was not only a member of the JBC, but its <i>ex-officio</i> chair. Despite the opposition CJ Sereno voiced out against Jardeleza, she was allowed to continue to sit and take part in the JBC deliberations on Jardeleza.<br><br>That she did not vote for Jardeleza’s inclusion or exclusion in the shortlist is not as material as her participation in the deliberations, where she had been at a better position to influence the decision of the JBC members. The Chief Justice’s participation in the deliberations allowed her to answer questions that other JBC members posed as they underwent the decision-making process of including or excluding Jardeleza; she could voice out her opinions and counter-arguments against the misgivings and thoughts of other JBC members while they were individually considering their votes, while effectively blocking whatever arguments there might be to support Jardeleza.<br><br>This is in contrast to treating her as any other oppositor, where she would have the opportunity to present her case against Jardeleza but not counter-argue as the JBC members deliberate. Effectively, even without voting, CJ Sereno was allowed to be an oppositor against Jardeleza and at the same time part of the body that would decide his fate – a situation that the maxim <i>nemo judex in parte sua</i> (no man should be a judge of his own cause) had warned against.<br><br>The selective application of the JBC’s rules is also highly suspect. The proceedings before the JBC showed that some of its members were aware that opposition to an applicant’s inclusion in the shortlist and his response thereto should be in writing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> The JBC, upon CJ Sereno’s insistence, chose to ignore this rule – which embodied procedural due process – for the sole reason that it would be “messy.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Instead, the JBC opted for an on-the-spot confrontation against Jardeleza, and applied the unanimous vote requirement under Section 2, Rule 10 of JBC-009. That a rule favorable to Jardeleza was not implemented while a rule that would make it more difficult for him to become a nominee was enforced, shows beyond doubt the impartiality that the JBC exercised against him.<br><br><b>C.5. The <i>JBC gravely abused its discretion<br>when it violated its own rules</i></b><br><br>The above discussion on procedural due process does not dwell on the topic of the JBC’s compliance with its rules; instead, it juxtaposed the JBC’s actions with the rudimentary principles of due process. The two principles of procedural due process – the right to be heard by an impartial tribunal – are required of the JBC, even without any express rule requiring them to observe these standards.<br><br>The JBC, however, has formulated its own rules, which even commanded that a higher standard for procedural process be applied to Jardeleza. But even so, by opting to selectively apply its own rules to the prejudice of Jardeleza, the JBC not only violated the precepts of procedural due process; it also violated the very rules it has set for itself and thus violated its own standards.<br><br>This kind of violation is far worse than the violation of an independently and externally imposed rule, and cannot but be the violation contemplated by the term grave abuse of discretion. The JBC cannot be allowed to create a rule and at the same time and without justifiable reason, choose when and to whom it shall apply, particularly when the application of these rules affects third persons who have relied on it.<br><br>In the case of Jardeleza, the JBC had prevailing rules on how to handle objections posed against applicants as well as rules that fully satisfied the requirements of procedural due process: an objection that is sufficiently serious is required to be in writing under required safeguards, and the applicant is given time to reply and the right to be heard.<br><br>The application of these rules on objection were, for some reason, different in the case of Jardeleza. Despite being a very serious candidate who in fact merited the vote of a majority of the members of the JBC, no specification in writing was ever made and the JBC contended itself with a phone notification whose scope and effectiveness are amorphous. The failure continued despite a formal letter-petition made by Jardeleza before this Court that, unfortunately, was itself blocked, so that Jardeleza had to resort to the present case.<br><br>The difference in treatment, of course, could be in the personality of the party objecting to Jardeleza – the Chair herself of the JBC – and by the selected timing of the presentation of the objection – after all objections had been heard during the final selection of the nominees to be shortlisted. These circumstances, to my mind, make the JBC violation far worse than a mere differential treatment of an applicant with an outside objector, particularly when, as shown above, circumstances exist revealing a focused effort to exclude Jardeleza.<br><br>Admittedly, both JBC-009<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> and JBC-010<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> allow the conduct of a discreet background information on the applicant. It is my view, however, that <b><i>once the discreet background investigation produces an opposition to the application, then such opposition should be in writing.</i></b><br><br>True, the JBC has the discretion to motu proprio entertain or discard an opposition. That is the import of the word ‘may’ in Section 3,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Rule 4. <b><i>But regardless of the JBC’s action or inaction to it, the opposition should be in writing</i></b>. Both Section 3, Rule 4 of JBC-009 and Section 2 of JBC-010 require that an opposition or complaint against an applicant be in writing, while the latter even requires that this be supported by annexes. In short, the JBC can receive an opposition to an application only if it is in writing, and cannot choose to receive verbal objections.<br><br>Once the complaint or opposition is given due course by the JBC, the Secretary of the Council is duty-bound under Section 2 of JBC-010 to furnish a copy to the applicant, who shall then have five days from receipt thereof to comment, if he so desires.<br><br>What is optional for the JBC is to require a testimony of the oppositor or his witnesses – but once it decides to do so, it is required to give due notice to the applicant who shall be allowed to cross-examine the opposite and to offer countervailing evidence.<br><br>Thus, I cannot agree with the way the JBC interpreted its rules to allow it to conduct an on-the-spot interrogation of Jardeleza, without even notifying him of the specificities of the charges against him. This, as earlier discussed, violates the basic rudiments of procedural due process.<br><br>It must be remembered, at this point, that in case of doubt as to which of two interpretations of a rule applies, the construction that enforces right and justice should prevail;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> that which recognizes due process, accountability in government and transparency should be favored. From this perspective and of this principle to the present case, the JBC’s interpretation of its rules should not be given effect to the extent that it violates due process and fosters partiality.<br><br><center><b><i>III. <u>Court Action on the Petition</u></i></b></center><br>In this all-important case where the matter in dispute may touch on the President’s power of appointment, the power of the JBC as a body tasked with the submission of nominees to the President, and the Court’s own power under the Constitution, the Court once again must tread carefully to ensure maximum harmony among the different contending entities while ensuring that the Constitution is fully respected.<br><br><b>A. <u>The President and his Appointing Power</u>.</b><br><br>No major obstacle appears with respect to the President’s power to appoint, as the Court’s lookout is protective – how to protect this power to ensure that it remains full and unfettered.<br><br>If at all, a problem may arise if the President overshoots the temporal limitation in the exercise of his appointing power, <i>i.e.</i>, if he does not appoint and waits for the final outcome of this case.<br><br>Any fear of conflict with the President on this point, however, would be misplaced as this is a case of first impression where the risk present is the fettering of the power of appointment. This Court should not be a stumbling block if the President takes the view that he should not exercise his power of appointment in the meantime that the list to be submitted to him is incomplete and is still being litigated in this Court. This presidential approach, in fact, is a recognition of the proper exercise of jurisdiction by this Court.<br><br><b>B. <u>Relationship with the JBC</u></b><br><br>As has earlier been discussed, the Court exercises two points of entry in assuming jurisdiction over the present petition. The first is its supervision over the JBC, while the second is the exercise of its expanded judicial power. Both of these powers are constitutional in nature.<br><br>The JBC is under the supervision, not just of a member of the Supreme Court but of this Court as a collegial body. Since the JBC’s main function is to recommend appointees to the judiciary,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> this constitutional design was put in place in order to reinforce another constitutional mandate granted to this Court: its administrative supervision over all courts and personnel thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>In <i>Ambil, Jr. v. Sandiganbayan and People</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> we characterized what makes up the power of supervision:<br><br><blockquote>On the other hand, the power of supervision means “overseeing or the authority of an officer to see to it that the subordinate officers perform their duties.”<b><i> If the subordinate officers fail or neglect to fulfill their duties, the official may take such action or step as prescribed by law to make them perform their duties.</i></b> Essentially, the power of supervision means no more than the power of ensuring that laws are faithfully executed, or that subordinate officers act within the law. <b><i>The supervisor or superintendent merely sees to it that the rules are followed,<u> but he does not lay down the rules, nor does he have discretion to modify or replace them</u></i></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup></blockquote><br>This ruling shows that the power of supervision is both normative and proactive. The supervisor not only ensures that the subordinate acts within the bounds of its law-laden duties and functions; he may also compel a subordinate to perform such duties and functions, whenever it becomes clear that the subordinate has already acted in disregard of it.<br><br>That the JBC is granted the full discretion to determine its own rules and select the nominees it deems qualified is beyond question. This discretion, however, like all other exercise of discretion, comes with the limitation that the JBC rules should not violate the fundamental rights of third parties as well as the provisions of the Constitution. Whenever any such violation occurs, the Supreme Court may step in wearing its second hat in its relationship with the JBC – exercising its power to correct grave abuse of discretion under Section 1, Article VIII of the Constitution.<br><br>Thus, under the Court’s supervisory authority over the JBC, it can compel the JBC to comply with its own rules. Had the letter-petition earlier been granted, the Court could have had compelled Jardeleza’s objectors to put their oppositions in writing and allow Jardeleza to comment thereon, and, if necessary, present countervailing evidence and cross-examine his oppositors in a hearing conducted for such purpose.<br><br>Compelling the JBC to exercise its discretion of including a person in a list of nominees, however, is another matter. The Court cannot issue a writ of <i>mandamus</i> to compel the JBC to include Jardeleza in the shortlist, since <i>mandamus</i> can only be directed to oblige the performance of a ministerial act. On the contrary, the decision to include a particular candidate in the shortlist of nominees is a discretionary action on the part of the JBC. As we explained in <i>Pefianco v. Moral</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br><blockquote>It is settled that mandamus is employed to compel the performance, when refused, of a ministerial duty, this being its main objective. It does not lie to require anyone to fulfill a discretionary duty. <b><i>It is essential to the issuance of a writ of mandamus that petitioner should have <u>a clear legal right</u> to the thing demanded and it must be the imperative duty of the respondent to perform the act required</i></b>. It never issues in doubtful cases. While it may not be necessary that the duty be absolutely expressed, it must nevertheless be clear. The writ will not issue to compel an official to do anything which is not his duty to do or which is his duty not to do, or give to the applicant anything to which he is not entitled by law. The writ neither confers powers nor imposes duties. It is simply a command to exercise a power already possessed and to perform a duty already imposed.</blockquote><br>Thus, the Court’s available action, if it is to be based on its power of supervision, is to direct the JBC to reconvene and accord Jardeleza the due process rights that must be accorded to him. Under the circumstances of this case, however, this remedy may not be available as the Court has to take into account the President’s time limitation in exercising its power of appointment. Thus, this available action, should only be considered in the future and in reserve, to be taken only in the more appropriate cases where time limitation is not a major constraint.<br><br>As the preceding discussions would show, the JBC had acted in grave abuse of discretion when it selectively applied its rules to make it more difficult for Jardeleza to be included in the shortlist. The JBC’s non-compliance with its own rules, in turn, violated Jardeleza’s due process rights. The recognition that this action is a grave abuse of discretion renders the proceedings undertaken on Jardeleza’s integrity null and void, i.e., an event that was never invoked, that never happened, and that should have no legal effect.<br><br>In other words, because of the JBC’s grave abuse of discretion in handling the accusations against Jardeleza’s integrity, its invocation of Rule 10, Section 2 of JBC-009 (requiring unanimous votes in cases where there are accusations against the applicant’s integrity) should be nullified. The accusations should be deemed never to have happened so that no need exists to invoke Section 2, Rule 10 of JBC-009. The practical effect of this declaration is to recognize the majority votes the JBC previously cast in Jardeleza’s favor. He should thus be declared included in the shortlist of nominees pursuant to this JBC action.<br><br><b><center>CONCLUSIONS<br></center></b><br>Based on the above premises, I join the <i>ponencia</i> in the results and additionally hold ? to ensure the maintenance of the Court’s integrity and dignity as an institution under the circumstances of this case ? that<br><br><table width="100%" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="CENTER">1)</div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">The JBC’s Supplemental Comment should be stricken from the records and its copies withdrawn from circulation with the caveat that its contents should not be publicly printed and disseminated; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">2) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">The Court should declare that the JBC’s selective application of its rules, in light of accusations against petitioner Jardeleza’s integrity, violated Jardeleza’s right to due process; the application therefore of Section 2, Rule 10 of JBC-009 is declared invalid; and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">3) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">In light of this invalidity and the majority votes the JBC already cast in Jardeleza’s favor, he should be declared included in the list the JBC submitted to the President on June 30, 2014.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>In light of the time considerations involved, the Court’s decision should be <b><i><u>immediately executory</u></i></b>.

In<i> Social Justice Society v. Atienza,</i> 568 Phil. 658, 715 we defined “supervision” as follows:<br><br>[Supervision] means overseeing or the power or authority of an officer to see that subordinate officers perform their duties. If the latter fail or neglect to fulfill them, the former may take such action or step as prescribed by law to make them perform their duties. Control, on the other hand, means the power of an officer to alter or modify or nullify or set aside what a subordinate officer ha[s] done in the performance of his duties and to substitute the judgment of the former for that of the latter.<br><br>Under this definition, the Court cannot dictate on the JBC the results of its assigned task, i.e., who to recommend or what standards to use to determine who to recommend. It cannot even direct the JBC on how and when to do its duty, but it can, under its power of supervision, direct the JBC to "take such action or step as prescribed by law to make them perform their duties," if the duties are not being performed because of JBC’s fault or inaction, or because of extraneous factors affecting performance.

If these rules are not followed, they may, in their discretion, order the act undone or redone by their subordinates or even decide to do it themselves. On the other hand, supervision does not cover such authority. Supervising officials merely see to it that the rules are followed, but they themselves do not lay down such rules, nor do they have the discretion to modify or replace them. If the rules are not observed, they may order the work done or redone, but only to conform to such rules. They may not prescribe their own manner of execution of the act.

Their assessment came not only from their own knowledge of the issues as validated by their own discreet investigation but also from the presentation of Senior Associate Justice Antonio Carpio. Senior Associate Justice Antonio Carpio was invited as resource person to place in context the objections to the inclusion of petitioner in the list of nominees. A copy of the memorandum of the Republic’s principal foreign legal counsel in this international arbitration was also made available to the members of the Council. The memorandum was addressed to petitioner as Solicitor General and the Secretary of Foreign Affairs.<br><br>Given the sensitive character of the grounds raised, the Judicial and Bar Council chose to provide petitioner with a discreet forum to hear his side of this issue. Despite being informed of the nature of the objection, petitioner instead chose to raise solely procedural grounds claiming that the due process clause requires cross-examination.<br><br>No person has a vested right to be nominated for a judicial position. In my view, the elemental requirements of fairness embedded in the due process clause was afforded to petitioner.<br><br>We should tread carefully, stay our hands, and practice judicial restraint. Significant cases such as these that could result in the nullification of an act of a constitutional organ certainly do not deserve hasty conclusions and the abbreviated deliberations. As the court of last resort, we have to give every argument in every document the conscious thought it deserves.<br><br>The Constitution grants to the Judicial and Bar Council the sole and exclusive power to vet not only the qualifications but also the fitness of applicants to this court. It is the Judicial and Bar Council that determines the extent of competence, independence, probity, and integrity that should be possessed by an applicant before he or she is included in the list of nominees prepared for the President.<br><br>By constitutional design, this court should wisely resist temptations to participate, directly or indirectly, in the nomination and appointment process of any of its members. In reality, nomination to this court carries with it the political and personal pressures from the supporters of strong contenders. This court is wisely shaded from these stresses. We know that the quality of the rule of law is reduced when any member of this court succumbs to pressure.<br><br>The separation of powers inherent in our Constitution is a rational check against abuse and the monopolization of all legal powers. We should not nullify any act of any constitutional organ unless there is grave abuse of discretion. The breach of a constitutional provision should be clearly shown and the necessity for the declaration of nullity should be compelling. Any doubt should trigger judicial restraint, not intervention. Doubts should be resolved in deference to the wisdom and prerogative of co-equal constitutional organs.<br><br>Through a petition for certiorari and mandamus with an application for a temporary restraining order, petitioner prays that we order that the list officially transmitted by the Judicial and Bar Council and received by the Office of the President be disregarded and in its place a new one made with his name included. This is what he means when he prays that his name be “deemed included.” He claims that the production of a new list is mandatory and ministerial on the part of the Judicial and Bar Council.<br><br><center><b><i>Conflicts in the narration of facts<br>should be resolved in favor of the constitutional body</i></b></center><br>There are conflicts in the ambient facts as gathered from the pleadings.<br><br>On March 6, 2014, the Judicial and Bar Council announced the opening, for application and recommendation, of the position of Associate Justice of the Supreme Court to be vacated by Associate Justice Roberto A. Abad. On March 14, 2014, the Council received a letter dated March 10, 2014 from Dean Danilo Concepcion of the University of the Philippines College of Law, nominating petitioner to the position. The Council also received a letter dated March 10, 2014 from petitioner accepting the nomination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>On April 24, 2014, the Council announced the names of candidates to the position, which included petitioner’s, as well as the schedule of their interviews.

The Council alleges as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br><blockquote><ol start="7"><li>The basis of the challenge, as detailed by the Chief Justice, was the events that transpired in the handling of the Republic of the Philippines’ Memorial in the case of <i>Republic of the Philippines v. The People’s Republic of China</i> of which Petitioner was the Philippine agent. The case involved compulsory arbitration under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) initiated by the Republic of the Philippines before the Permanent Court of Arbitration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br></li><li> According to her, in the Philippine Memorial, the Petitioner deliberately sought the exclusion of a discussion on a very important physical feature in the West Philippine Sea. This feature is the “rock” referred to as Itu Aba. . . . The importance of the paragraphs that the Petitioner instructed the international lawyers to delete from the entire Philippine claim will be discussed in a later portion of this Supplemental Comment.<br><br></li><li>In the view of the Chief Justice, this deliberate refusal to promote the remedies available to the Philippines, by deliberately weakening the country’s arguments, showed that the Petitioner had been disloyal to the country.<br><br><b><i></i></b></li><li><b><i> To provide the other JBC Members a factual background, the Chief Justice told them that she first learned about Petitioner’s behaviour as the Philippine agent in the case through Senior Associate Justice Carpio. She then conducted discreet inquiries on her own.

Justice Lagman, Atty. Mejia and Atty. Cayosa likewise manifested their intention to vote for Petitioner, had it not been for the seriousness of the issue on the West Philippine Sea. <i><b>They commonly agreed on giving him an opportunity to present his side.</b></i> For his part, Senator Pimentel inquired on the definition of integrity as contemplated in Section 2 of Rule 10.<br><br></li><li>The Chief Justice indicated that because of the seriousness of the matter being raised, it would be the first time that anyone would be invoking Section 2, Rule 10, and unless a different scenario ensues, she would be invoking the rule at the appropriate time.<br><br></li><li> On 16 June 2014, the JBC met again in an executive session. The Chief Justice informed the body that since there was no change in the conditions obtaining since the meeting on 5 June 2014, she would invoke Rule 10 with respect to Petitioner’s nomination. She was asked whether the integrity objection would hold considering that there was no proof that the Petitioner obtained money for his actuation in the West Philippine Sea case. She explained her point of view that one’s capacity and willingness to uphold the Constitution determines integrity. An objection to integrity does not necessarily require proof of unlawful receipt of money in exchange for a decision or an action. She stressed that one does not have integrity when one is not willing to protect the interest of one’s client to the utmost, especially in this case when the client happens to be the Republic. She said that through his actuations, Petitioner has demonstrated weakness of character. She inferred that he may have been listening to extraneous factors or may have been promised something. She also said she had seen many instances where national interests had been compromised because of personal agendas. She cited her experiences as the Director of the Institute of International Legal Studies in the University of the Philippines, when she observed the actuations of certain government officials. She saw how the country’s ability to protect Scarborough Shoal was compromised by a foreign affairs official in exchange for a possible United Nations position. She also observed how public officials were willing to see the country lose its defense in the two international arbitration cases brought against it by the companies Fraport and Philippine International Air Terminals Co., Inc., all for something other than duty to the Republic.<br><br></li><li>Congressman Tupas raised questions on the proper interpretation and application of Rule 10, Section 2, and extensive discussions on the rule followed.<br><br><b><i></i></b></li><li><b><i><u>It was finally agreed that Petitioner would be invited to explain his side before the JBC at its next meeting on 30 June 2014.

He indicated that the same should also be required of Senior Associate Justice Carpio. Congressman Tupas indicated that he wanted to hear for himself the explanation of Petitioner, but the latter refused. Petitioner further stated that he would not be lulled into waiving his rights.

(Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></li></ol></blockquote><br>Petitioner, on his part, claims that while he was informed by Justice Lagman of the integrity objection, he was given very little information:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li> The acts of respondent Chief Justice Sereno in the events leading up to and during the vote on the shortlist on June 30, 2014 show a premeditated and persistent pattern of exclusion on the petitioner.<br><br></li><li> First, on 16 and 17 June 2014, petitioner was informed by JBC member Justice Aurora S. Lagman, through a phone call, that respondent Chief Justice Sereno directed that petitioner make himself "available" to appear before them on 30 June 2014. Petitioner was also informed that Chief Justice Sereno invoked Section 2, Rule 10 of JBC-009 against him at their June 5 and June 16 meetings. Justice Lagman stated, without detail, that the objections had to do with his work as Solicitor General, but that Chief Justice Sereno will be the one to inform him of her objection to his integrity, at the 30 June 2014 meeting. <i>Petitioner was never formally notified in writing of the allegations against him.</i> This, notwithstanding that respondent Chief Justice Sereno had already been campaigning against petitioner at the previous JBC meetings of June 5 and 16, 2014.<br><br></li><li>Second, petitioner's letter-petition filed before the Supreme Court on 25 June 2014, or five (5) days before the 30 June 2014 hearing of the JBC, was not acted upon by respondent Chief Justice Sereno who controls the scheduling of the en banc meetings and agenda. Thus, the reliefs- which are based on the JBC's own rules-prayed for by petitioner, including, among others, a written notice containing the sworn specifications of the charges against him by his oppositors, the sworn statements of supporting witnesses, if any, and copies of documents in support of the charges, were mooted and made academic pursuant to the Honorable Court's Resolution dated 08 July 2014. <i>Petitioner appeared before the JBC on 30 June 2014 with very little information concerning the objections against his integrity</i>. All that he could gather was that it had to do with his work as Solicitor General.<br><br></li><li>Third, during the 30 June 2014 meeting, petitioner was informed by Secretary of Justice Leila M. de Lima, just before the JBC summoned him at 2:00 PM, that Associate Justice Antonio T. Carpio testified against him "about work." A "very confidential legal memorandum that clarifies and concretizes the integrity objection that the Chief Justice raised against petitioner" was allegedly distributed. Petitioner was not informed about the existence of such memorandum nor furnished a copy thereof. When Chief Justice Sereno asked petitioner if he wanted to defend himself, petitioner was compelled to reiterate his request for due process as prayed for in his letter-petition. Representative [Niel] Tupas, Jr. also asked petitioner if he wanted to defend himself. Petitioner answered he cannot defend himself unless his due process rights were granted. Petitioner also submitted into the record a Statement, which was again a plea for due process. <i>Instead of heeding his request, respondent JBC considered petitioner's refusal to explain as a waiver of his right to answer the unspecified allegations</i>. The 30 June 2014 meeting lasted about ten (10) minutes.<br><br></li><li> Fourth, the JBC released the shortlist of nominees on the same day. It is a fact that petitioner obtained a majority of four votes-the same number of votes obtained by Judge Reynaldo B. Daway-even after respondent Chief Justice Sereno and Justice Carpio presented their objections. <i>Petitioner, however, was not included in the shortlist, despite his plea for it to stay its hand and provide him real opportunity to be heard.</i><br><br></li><li>Clearly, the manner by which petitioner was given only verbal notice of the allegations against him and forced to answer on the spot said allegations shows a pre-meditated and persistent pattern of exclusion that deprived him of a reasonable opportunity to mount a meaningful defense. It is a fact that no complaint or opposition was filed against petitioner after the public had been notified of his nomination. No opposition was raised against him during his public interview on 29 May 2014. It was only on 16 and 17 June 2014, or shortly before the final deliberation on the shortlist, that petitioner was verbally notified of respondent Chief Justice Sereno's objection against his integrity, and with no details at that. The objections against him were therefore foisted past the period for filing objections to his nomination-a move calculated to deprive him of the opportunity to properly respond in accordance with the JBC's own rules. Even his plea for relief before the Honorable Court, as a last resort, was rendered useless due to the malicious scheme employed by respondent Chief Justice Sereno.<br><br></li><li>Deprived of a formal notice detailing the unspecified allegations against him, coupled with the lack of reasonable time to prepare for his defense, the circumstances under which petitioner was placed patently demonstrate a premeditated and persistent pattern to railroad the rejection of his nomination. Without having been previously informed of the specific details of the accusation against him, petitioner had only two options-either to participate in the proceeding unarmed with information and risk losing his case for lack of opportunity to present strong countervailing evidence, or refuse to participate in the proceeding and be estopped from claiming he was denied an opportunity to be heard. Either way, petitioner was caught in a dilemma which effectively deprived him of any real opportunity to be heard.<br><br></li><li>Even now, petitioner is kept in the dark as to the details of the objection against him which allegedly pertains to "a very important specific case for the Republic." Petitioner was not, and has not been, furnished a copy of Annex "J" of the JBC Comment. If, indeed, the objection to petitioner's integrity relates to a matter of highest importance, there is an even greater reason to disclose the allegations in public. Concealing the details of these allegations amounts to irresponsible rumor-mongering which maximizes petitioner's inability to defend himself.<br><br></li><li>Petitioner assumes that the objection against him is related to the conduct of his official functions as Solicitor General of the Republic. The JBC Comment vaguely refers to an alleged "inability to discharge the duty of the Solicitor General" on "a matter of highest importance" relating to the "way he handled a very important specific case for the Republic." He therefore finds it in gross violation of his rights to due process because, while his principals in the Executive Department have not sought it fit to complain, much less sanction him in any way for his official conduct "on a very important specific case for the Republic," two members of the Judiciary, who are in no way his supervisors or principals, have found reasons to object to his nomination on the basis of what can only be considered second-hand information. (Emphasis in the original)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></li></ol></blockquote><br>However, petitioner, in his reply, admits to have been informed of the integrity issue against him at least immediately after the executive session. Until this case was deliberated by this court, he has not given any sufficient explanation about the substance of the charges. Neither has he informed this court that he will not do so in view of any privileges he wishes to avail.<br><br>His claim that he was given very little information about the integrity objection is contrary to the statement of Justice Lagman who disclosed during the June 30, 2014 session the following:<br><br><blockquote>At this point, Justice Lagman said that upon informing Petitioner that Itu Aba was the subject of the integrity issue against him, the Petitioner mentioned that someone told him that a German scholar advised its exclusion.

The historical context of its creation has been previously passed upon by this court in <i>Chavez v. Judicial and Bar Council</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Long before the naissance of the present Constitution, the annals of history bear witness to the fact that the exercise of appointing members of the Judiciary has always been the exclusive prerogative of the executive and legislative branches of the government. Like their progenitor of American origins, both the Malolos Constitution and the 1935 Constitution had vested the power to appoint the members of the Judiciary in the President, subject to confirmation by the Commission on Appointments. It was during these times that the country became witness to the deplorable practice of aspirants seeking confirmation of their appointment in the Judiciary to ingratiate themselves with the members of the legislative body.<br><br>Then, with the fusion of executive and legislative power under the 1973 Constitution, the appointment of judges and justices was no longer subject to the scrutiny of another body. It was absolute, except that the appointees must have all the qualifications and none of the disqualifications.<br><br>Prompted by the clamor to rid the process of appointments to the Judiciary from political pressure and partisan activities, the members of the Constitutional Commission saw the need to create a separate, competent and independent body to recommend nominees to the President. Thus, it conceived of a body representative of all the stakeholders in the judicial appointment process and called it the Judicial and Bar Council (JBC). Its composition, term and functions are provided under Section 8, Article VIII of the Constitution . . . .<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></blockquote><br>The creation of a Judicial and Bar Council was proposed by former Chief Justice Roberto Concepcion during the deliberations in the drafting of the 1987 Constitution. According to him, the committee on justice of the Constitutional Commission “felt neither the President nor the Commission on Appointments would have the time to carefully study the qualifications of every candidate, especially with respect to their probity and sense of morality.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Commissioner Rene Sarmiento echoed this sentiment, stressing that “the creation of the Council is a step towards achieving judicial independence.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Thus, under Article VIII, Section 8(5) of the Constitution, the Judicial and Bar Council “shall have the principal function of recommending appointees to the Judiciary.” In its entirety, the provision states:<br><br><blockquote>Section 8. (1) A Judicial and Bar Council is hereby created under the supervision of the Supreme Court composed of the Chief Justice as ex officio Chairman, the Secretary of Justice, and a representative of the Congress as ex officio Members, a representative of the Integrated Bar, a professor of law, a retired Member of the Supreme Court, and a representative of the private sector.<br><br>(2) The regular members of the Council shall be appointed by the President for a term of four years with the consent of the Commission on Appointments. Of the Members first appointed, the representative of the Integrated Bar shall serve for four years, the professor of law for three years, the retired Justice for two years, and the representative of the private sector for one year.<br><br>(3) The Clerk of the Supreme Court shall be the Secretary ex officio of the Council and shall keep a record of its proceedings.<br><br>(4) The regular Members of the Council shall receive such emoluments as may be determined by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court shall provide in its annual budget the appropriations for the Council.<br><br>(5) The Council shall have the principal function of recommending appointees to the Judiciary. It may exercise such other functions and duties as the Supreme Court may assign to it.</blockquote><br>While the President has the discretion to choose who to appoint in the judiciary, the Constitution delegates to the Council the sovereign power to vet these choices after a careful and deliberative process.

It provides for those who have some function vis a vis the law that should be applied and interpreted by our courts.

A ministerial duty is one that “requires neither the exercise of official discretion nor judgment.” It connotes an act in which nothing is left to the discretion of the person executing it. It is a “simple, definite duty arising under conditions admitted or proved to exist and imposed by law.” Mandamus is available to compel action, when refused, on matters involving discretion, but not to direct the exercise of judgment or discretion one way or the other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></blockquote><br>The determination by the Judicial and Bar Council of the qualifications and fitness of applicants for positions in the judiciary is not a ministerial duty.

Judicial and Bar Council</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> clarifies a unique instance when mandamus lies against the Council. This is with respect only to the constitutional duty to allow the President the mandatory 90 days to make an appointment. Thus:<br><br><blockquote><b>The duty of the JBC to submit a list of nominees before the start of the President’s mandatory 90-day period to appoint is ministerial, but its selection of the candidates whose names will be in the list to be submitted to the President lies within the discretion of the JBC</b>. The object of the petitions for mandamus herein should only refer to the duty to submit to the President the list of nominees for every vacancy in the Judiciary, because in order to constitute unlawful neglect of duty, there must be an unjustified delay in performing that duty.

It is the only constitutional body with the power to interpret its rules to determine the competence, integrity, probity, and independence of applicants to the judiciary. We cannot superimpose this court’s interpretation even if in our view it would be a better one.<br><br>The Rules of the Judicial and Bar Council contains Rule 10, Section 2 which provides:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 2. Votes required when integrity of a qualified applicant is challenged. - In every case where the integrity of an applicant who is not otherwise disqualified for nomination is raised or challenged the affirmative vote of all the Members of the Council must be obtained for the favorable consideration of his nomination.</blockquote><br>The current members of this court may have their own views with respect to the wisdom of this rule. For instance, some may disagree with the qualified vote requirement for questions of integrity. Others may prefer a clearer definition of what integrity may mean or who may invoke the rule as well as the procedure after it is invoked. These, however, reflect policy preferences which are properly addressed to the constitutional body to whom the sovereign delegated these matters of interpretation, i.e., the Judicial and Bar Council.<br><br>There is nothing inherently unconstitutional with the lack of statutory or procedural definition of integrity. This remains within the purview of the members of the Council. It is a matter that is addressed to their reasoned judgment. The Judicial and Bar Council is designed to act collegially. This is where contending views coming from various sectors affected by every nomination and represented in the discussions may be taken into consideration. Integrity can mean different things for different people. Like all significant words, it has a sufficient set of meanings that can frame expectations but at the same time is left malleable to address the needs at present. The acts which lead to questions relating to integrity may be different for each candidate. Thus, the past actions of a Justice of the Court of Appeals, a Solicitor General, or a Dean of a College of Law who is aspiring for the position of Associate Justice of this court that will be assessed by the Judicial and Bar Council will be different.<br><br>As seen in the debates in the minutes of the meeting of the Council submitted to us through its supplemental comment, the lack of integrity could be seen through acts which directly or indirectly could be considered as dishonest and corrupt which result in some illicit pecuniary benefit to the applicant. For the principal legal counsel of government tasked to oversee arbitration to protect our claims to our maritime resources, lack of integrity can mean unexplained decisions which put this important initiative in peril.<br><br>It is not for us to make these judgments simply because it is not our constitutional duty to do so.<br><br>Neither is there anything strange with a qualified vote.<br><br>Even our Constitution provides for qualified votes for some sovereign acts such as the processes for the amendment of our Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> A qualified vote underscores the importance of the matter under scrutiny. Of the four requirements — probity, integrity, competence, and independence — it may have been the policy decision of the Judicial and Bar Council to give importance to integrity.<br><br>There are very plausible reasons for this policy.<br><br>In this court, it is the quality of integrity of each member that inspires us to have the courage to use our constitutional duty to speak to power. We speak to power whether this is sourced formally from the authority of the Constitution or informally when it comes from the political influence, commercial standing, or the ability of a party, litigant, or lawyer to mold media opinion. While theoretically and constitutionally protected, we are hounded by the same human fears as any person occupying a public office. We all know that we disgrace the privilege of our office if we succumb to fear or favor.<br><br>More than any other quality, integrity emboldens us to separate the “what” from the “who”: that is, to decide for what is right — in the light of the law and principle — rather than consider who it will incidentally and immediately benefit. Giving it primordial importance through a stricter voting requirement when invoked is not bereft of reason. It is not arbitrary, capricious, or whimsical.<br><br>There are members of this court who feel that the invocation by one member of the Council of this rule on integrity without any discussion amounts to a veto of its collegial nature. The records submitted to us are clear: (1) discussions ensued when it was invoked and (2) all members of the Judicial and Bar Council, after the basis of the objection had been laid out clearly before them, agreed that it be invoked.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> There was no violation of the collegiate nature of the Council.<br><br>The Rules permits a member of the Council to invoke the rule. The Chief Justice, who is the ex-officio chair of the Council, initially manifested that she was invoking the rule in the executive session of the Council on June 5, 2014.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>A discussion took place during the executive session on June 16, 2014 regarding Rule 10, Section 2. Thus, in the minutes as submitted to this court:<br><br><blockquote>Secretary de Lima inquired whether the Chief Justice would still invoke Rule 10, Sec. 2 of the JBC-009 (JBC Rules) notwithstanding the vote of all the other members. She cautioned that there may be a lot of explaining to do on the invocation of the Rule.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>At this juncture, Congressman Tupas suggested a review of the JBC Rules on integrity and went on to read the provisions in Rule 10, Section 2, thereof:<br><br>. . . .<br><br>Congressman Tupas stressed the need to carefully examine the Rules since this is the first time that the Rule will be invoked. For instance, he poised the question of how many votes must a candidate garner when the affirmative vote of all Members of the Council is required under Rule 10, Sec. 2. There is also the matter of who can raise or challenge the integrity of an applicant: must it be raised by a Member, or can a non-Member raise or challenge under the Rule. At what <i>stage</i> may the challenge on the integrity of an applicant be raised? Should there be a need for a prior complaint or objection?<br><br>Secretary De Lima commented that the Rules do not say whether the challenge must be made by an insider or an outsider.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup></blockquote><br>The minutes of the executive session undoubtedly show that the members of the Council were aware of the import of the rule and its consequences. When the Council met again on June 30, 2014:<br><br><blockquote>A discussion on Rule 10, Section 2 of JBC-009 (JBC Rules) followed. Congressman Tupas asked if the Rule is being against a candidate, will the name of the candidate remain. The Council unanimously agreed that the name of candidate will still be part of the ballot.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The excerpts of the minutes show that the Council, as a collegial body, not only allowed the invocation of its own rules by a Council member, but also agreed that petitioner’s name would still be part of the ballot, despite knowledge that he might not get a unanimous vote.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>This indicates that the Council wanted to see the actual votes for a candidate. There can be no other conclusion except that the Council required a unanimous vote of all the other members excluding the member who invoked the rule on integrity. Excluding the vote of the Chief Justice, petitioner still failed to garner unanimity of the remaining members. He received four (4) votes of the possible five (5).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>Clearly, it was not the will of only one member (the Chief Justice) which governed. The invocation of the rule was collegially discussed. Clearly, the exclusion of petitioner from the list was a unanimous Council decision.<br><br>We are not presented with a situation where only one member invoked the integrity rule and the remaining members were unanimous in still including the name of the applicant objected to in the list. This is not the situation that gave rise to the issues in this case. The exercise of the power of judicial review must be narrowly tailored in the light of the facts presented before us. It is not our duty to declare an act as unconstitutional on the basis of speculative facts which could happen in the future. We are not constitutionally empowered to provide advisory opinions. Neither would it be equitable to declare an act as unconstitutional on the basis of facts which have not yet happened.<br><br>This opinion is, therefore, limited to the ambient facts of this case. I reserve opinion for other possibilities relating to Rule 10, Section 2 which have not yet happened. The Judicial and Bar Council, not this court, continues to have the power to amend its rules in the light of some possibilities that, in its judgment, may result in inequity.<br><br>With respect to the facts of this case, the interpretation and application of the rule by the Council were not implausible or bereft of reason. Hence, the challenge against its constitutionality should fail.<br><br><center><i>VI<br>There is no violation of due process</i></center><br>The crux of this petition was that petitioner was allegedly deprived of his constitutional right to due process when he was not given an opportunity to be heard with regard to the questions against his integrity. He impliedly invokes Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution which states that:<br><br><blockquote>No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of the law. . . .</blockquote><br>In <i>White Light Corporation v. City of Manila,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> this court said:<br><br><blockquote>. . . Due process evades a precise definition. The purpose of the guaranty is to prevent arbitrary governmental encroachment against the life, liberty and property of individuals. The due process guaranty serves as a protection against arbitrary regulation or seizure. Even corporations and partnerships are protected by the guaranty insofar as their property is concerned.<br><br>The due process guaranty has traditionally been interpreted as imposing two related but distinct restrictions on government, “procedural due process” and “substantive due process.” Procedural due process refers to the procedures that the government must follow before it deprives a person of life, liberty, or property. Procedural due process concerns itself with government action adhering to the established process when it makes an intrusion into the private sphere. Examples range from the form of notice given to the level of formality of a hearing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup></blockquote><br>Before the due process clause of the Constitution may be invoked, there must first be an encroachment to one’s “life, liberty, or property.” Petitioner carries the burden of showing that an act of government affects an indubitable vested right protected by the Constitution.<br><br>This court clarified the concept of a vested right in <i>ABAKADA Guro Party List v. Executive Secretary Ermita</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br><blockquote>The concept of “vested right” is a consequence of the constitutional guaranty of due process that expresses a present fixed interest which in right reason and natural justice is protected against arbitrary state action; it includes not only legal or equitable title to the enforcement of a demand but also exemptions from new obligations created after the right has become vested. <b>Rights are considered vested when the right to enjoyment is a present interest, absolute, unconditional, and perfect or fixed and irrefutable</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><i>No vested right to be nominated</i><br><br>No person has a constitutionally vested right to be nominated to a judicial position. Just because a person meets the qualifications does not entitle him or her to a nomination. The Judicial and Bar Council must render a finding of his or her fitness which results in the inclusion of his or her name in the list. A nomination is not a right that is protected by the due process clause of the Constitution. It is rather a privilege granted to one who has successfully passed the application process and has qualified.<br><br>The attainment of the majority vote of Council members is not an “absolute, unconditional, and perfect or fixed and irrefutable”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> basis to garner a place in the shortlist. As discussed, under the present rules, when integrity is at stake, the vote requirement may be unanimity in the vote of the remaining members excluding the member who invoked Rule 10, Section 2 of the rules of the Judicial and Bar Council. Moreover, the list of qualified candidates is still subject to the final deliberation of the Council in an executive session before the list is submitted to the Office of the President.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br><i>Assuming arguendo, procedural<br>due process is not as technical as<br>claimed by petitioner</i><br><br>Fairness as embodied in the due process clause of the Constitution takes its form in relation to the right invoked and the forum where it is invoked. Certainly, when the accused invokes his or her right in criminal trial, this takes the form among others of the right to full-blown cross-examination of all witnesses presented by the prosecution. For applicants to a vacancy in the Supreme Court and in the process of the Judicial and Bar Council, the right to be considered for purposes of an assessment of his or her qualifications and fitness also certainly does not require a forum for cross-examination. The Council is possessed with a wide latitude to draw information so that it may, consistent with its constitutional duty, make a selection of at least three (3) names from a field of so many applicants.<br><br>The Constitution does not require a specific procedure whether in terms of a process or a required vote. The sparse language of the Constitution leaves it up to the Council to decide on these details. The Council only needs to follow its own rules. It is entirely possible, at minimum, that fairness and due process be already met when the applicant is given the opportunity to submit whatever information he or she deems important subject only to reasonable requirements of form.<br><br>Even assuming, only for the sake of argument, that petitioner is right with his insistence on procedural due process, this court’s response is best seen through the prism of the concurring opinion of Justice Brion in <i>Perez v. Philippine Telegraph and Telephone Company</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br><blockquote>At its most basic, procedural due process is about fairness in the mode of procedure to be followed. It is not a novel concept, but one that traces its roots in the common law principle of natural justice.<br><br>Natural justice connotes the requirement that administrative tribunals, when reaching a decision, must do so with procedural fairness. If they err, the superior courts will step in to quash the decision by certiorari or prevent the error by a writ of prohibition. The requirement was initially applied in a purely judicial context, but was subsequently extended to executive regulatory fact-finding, as the administrative powers of the English justices of the peace were transferred to administrative bodies that were required to adopt some of the procedures reminiscent of those used in a courtroom. Natural justice was comprised of two main sub-rules: <i>audi alteram partem </i>– that a person must know the case against him and be given an opportunity to answer it; and <i>nemo judex in sua cause debe esse </i>- the rule against bias. Still much later, the natural justice principle gave rise to the duty to be fair to cover governmental decisions which cannot be characterized as judicial or quasi-judicial in nature.<br><br>While the<i> audi alteram partem</i> rule provided for the right to be notified of the case against him, the right to bring evidence, and to make argument – whether in the traditional judicial or the administrative setting – common law maintained a distinction between the two settings. <b><i>“An administrative tribunal had a duty to act in good faith and to listen fairly to both sides, but not to treat the question as if it were a trial. There would be no need to examine under oath, nor even to examine witnesses at all. Any other procedure could be utilized which would obtain the information required, as long as the parties had an opportunity to know and to contradict anything which might be prejudicial to their case.</i></b>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup>(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>This characterization of due process is not without precedent. In <i>Ledesma v. Court of Appeals</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br><blockquote>. . . Due process, as a constitutional precept, does not always and in all situations require a trial-type proceeding. Due process is satisfied when a person is notified of the charge against him and given an opportunity to explain or defend himself. In administrative proceedings, the filing of charges and giving reasonable opportunity for the person so charged to answer the accusations against him constitute the minimum requirements of due process. The essence of due process is simply to be heard, or as applied to administrative proceedings, an opportunity to explain one’s side, or an opportunity to seek a reconsideration of the action or ruling complained of.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup></blockquote><br>In<i> Pichay v. Office of the Executive Secretary</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br><blockquote>. . . In administrative proceedings, the filing of charges and giving reasonable opportunity for the person so charged to answer the accusations against him constitute the minimum requirements of due process, which simply means having the opportunity to explain one’s side. Hence, as long as petitioner was given the opportunity to explain his side and present evidence, the requirements of due process are satisfactorily complied with because what the law abhors is an absolute lack of opportunity to be heard.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup></blockquote><br>Accordingly, the essence of procedural due process is simply the right to be heard. Petitioner’s insistence, therefore, that the Council must adhere to a procedure <i>he</i> suggested, using <i>his</i> interpretation of the Judicial and Bar Council’s own rules, goes beyond the minimum required by jurisprudence.<br><br><i>Petitioner was given the<br>opportunity to be heard</i><br><br>The right to procedural due process cannot be derived from an invocation of Rule 4, Sections 3 and 4 of JBC-009, which state:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 3.

Anonymous complaints. - Anonymous complaints against an applicant shall not be given due course, unless there appears on its face a probable cause sufficient to engender belief that the allegations <b>may</b> be true.

The use of the word “may” is permissive, not mandatory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> The Council retains the discretion to require that opposition be written. It also retains the discretion not to require comment on any of the opposition filed. This may apply when the basis of the opposition is too trivial or when the members determine that they are already possessed with sufficient information necessary for them to vote their preferences. But this is not what happened in this case.<br><br>Contrary to petitioner’s allegations, petitioner was given the opportunity to explain his version of the facts that were based to question his integrity. The Council insisted that petitioner be allowed to explain his side. The minutes of the executive session dated June 16, 2014 narrate:<br><br><blockquote>Justice Lagman stated that Sol. Gen. Jardeleza had a good reputation, but considering the seriousness of the allegations on his integrity, he may challenge the process. She said that fairness dictates that he be given due process and moved that Sol. Gen.

Jardeleza a chance to explain. Duly seconded, the motion to invite Sol. Gen.

Instead of responding on the substance of the matter to enlighten and convince the Council of his integrity, he chose to emphasize the procedural aspect of his claims. Rather than provide the Council with the substantial arguments to defend his integrity, he chose to find the procedural path defaulting in the opportunity to assist the Council in assessing his fitness. <b><i>As the Solicitor General is the principal legal counsel of government, we could assume that there would have been nothing amiss for him to state his substantial arguments arguendo.</i></b><br><br>Petitioner appeared to have abandoned his argument using JBC-009 when he filed his reply, stating that “[r]eliance on Sections 3 and 4 of JBC-009 is misplaced.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> He argued instead that Section 2 of JBC-10, or “Rule to Further Promote Public Awareness of and Accessibility to the Proceedings of the Judicial and Bar Council,” requires “complaints and oppositions to be in writing and under oath.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> Section 2 states:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 2.

The candidate shall have five (5) days from receipt thereof within which to file his comment to the complaint or opposition, if he so desires.<br></blockquote><br>In the first place, petitioner was the one who relied on JBC-009 to formulate his argument that he was deprived of due process. On page 7 of his petition, he alleged that “[t]he [Judicial and Bar Council] gravely abused its discretion when it denied petitioner the mandatory due process safeguards under its own rules,” citing Rule 4, Sections 3 and 4 of JBC-009. He cannot, by way of reply, suddenly abandon that argument and insist on a different provision.<br><br>The reluctance of the Chief Justice to put the matter in writing was reasonable considering that it was a matter of national security. According to the minutes of the executive session held on June 30, 2014, “the Members agreed that it is best that this be kept as confidential as possible to avoid problems for the country.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> The confidentiality observed by the Council was not for the purpose of denying petitioner his rights.

Thus, for issues raised by petitioner and for the relief he prays for, the Executive Secretary cannot act as an alter ego of the President.<br><br>Second, Article VIII, Section 4(1) of the Constitution clearly provides for a constitutional period for making appointments to this court. Thus:<br><br><blockquote>Section 4. (1) The Supreme Court shall be composed of a Chief Justice and fourteen Associate Justices. It may sit en banc or in its discretion, in division of three, five, or seven Members. <b><i>Any vacancy shall be filled within ninety days from the occurrence thereof</i></b>.</blockquote><br>In <i>De Castro v.

Justice Abad’s retirement on his birthday which was May 22, 2014 caused the vacancy in the present court. The President, therefore, has until August 20, 2014 to make an appointment for the vacancy. A temporary restraining order is a writ in equity provided for only in the rules of procedure promulgated by this court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> This court cannot, by way of temporary restraining order, delay the running of the period mandated by the Constitution.<br><br>Third, it would be highly irregular and a violation of the ethical rules of the profession for the present Solicitor General to request for an injunctive writ or a temporary restraining order against the President who is his client and principal.<br><br>Even assuming, for the sake of argument, that a temporary restraining order may be issued to restrain the President from performing his constitutional duty, petitioner has not shown proof that he is entitled to its issuance. In <i>Philippine School of Business Administration v. Hon.

He has not shown that he possesses a clear and unmistakable right. Therefore, there is no material and substantial invasion that must be prevented through a writ from this court.<br><br><center><i>VIII<br>To grant the reliefs prayed for by petitioner<br>inequitably prejudices the rights of third parties<br>not impleaded in the petition</i></center><br>The rights of those currently in the list of nominees transmitted by the Judicial and Bar Council to the President will be impaired by the reliefs prayed for by petitioner in this case. They are indispensable parties to this case because no complete and final determination of the issues can be had without their participation. They have more of a vested right in the preservation of the current list of nominees than petitioner. They certainly will have a more adversarial stance than that of the Executive Secretary. Petitioner should have impleaded them and given them the opportunity also to be heard by this court.<br><br>The proper remedy would be for this court to order that the four individuals currently in the list of nominees transmitted to the President be impleaded and the opportunity to be heard given. They deserve to be heard before this court even considers diluting their chances of being appointed. Alternatively, any relief should, therefore, be prospective and should not affect their vested rights. Assuming without conceding that the majority will vote to nullify Rule 10, Section 2 of the Rules of the Judicial and Bar Council, its effects should be prospective. Those who were nominated deserve the benefit of the presumption of constitutionality of the rules under which they were vetted.<br><br>The lack of efficacy of petitioner’s reliefs due to the deliberations of this court can be attributable only to petitioner. His petition failed to implead all the indispensable parties. We cannot render a decision that will be at odds with the same constitutional provision of due process of law which petitioner invokes.<br><br><center><i>IX<br>Proposal to expunge supplemental<br>comment-reply of the Judicial and Bar Council</i><br></center><br>A member<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> of this court is suggesting that the national interest requires the suppression of the matters raised in the supplemental comment-reply of the Judicial and Bar Council. This implies that we decide on this case without considering the basis of the objection made by the Chief Justice and heard by the other members of the Council. In effect, we are asked to decide without discussing the merits of the position of one of the respondents.<br><br>I disagree that this is the proper way to decide this case.<br><br>In my view, it is the insistence of petitioner not to respond directly to the objections during the <i>in camera</i> and confidential discussions of the Council on June 30, 2014 that has now caused both sides to lay bare their full arguments. Surely, as much as petitioner believes in the importance of defending himself in this court, respondents are also entitled to believe that it is institutionally important for them to defend the integrity of the Judicial and Bar Council. For petitioner to claim due process of law is the more important question. For respondents, petitioner was accorded his opportunity to be heard, and the more important question is there would have been an anomaly in our arbitral claims.<br><br>Both these views are entitled to our full consideration.<br><br>Parenthetically, the documents that have been submitted in the international arbitration between the Republic of the Philippines and China are now the subject of vigorous academic discussion on both sides.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> Discussion in our opinions on the existence of this controversy will not be new. It may even perhaps contribute to the public’s desire for transparency. The Solicitor General is a public official as well as a lawyer. The arbitral claim affects all of us. It behooves our public to fully understand its contents. It behooves us to meet all the arguments of the parties fully in the spirit of fairness and objectivity.<br><br>I do not share Justice Brion’s characterization of the actuations of the Chief Justice. I would rather be more circumspect and grant a colleague her full right to provide this court with her explanations of the motives leveled against her. The power of our published opinions compels us to treat our words with the responsibility that this institution and its members deserve.<br><br>The letter filed earlier by the Solicitor General did not contain a prayer for special raffle. The opportunity to have an early raffle of the case is known to all seasoned practitioners. Certainly, petitioner compares to none in terms of present experience in this court. Be that as it may, we do have a raffle committee. The raffle committee does not include the Chief Justice.<br><br>The Chief Justice inhibited early. This means that she had no control over the promulgation of our relevant resolutions. The Senior Associate Justice also inhibited because he was named in the petition. At the relevant times, the third most senior member of this court was on leave. This will probably explain why there was some delay in the promulgation of some of our resolutions.<br><br>It is normal for a deliberative body to initially hear the tentative views of its members. Thus, the matter of invoking Rule 10, Section 2 of the Council’s rules was discussed. Most of us can imagine how the conversations may have transpired as all of those concerned would have wanted to find solutions to avoid the unnecessary taint on the character of petitioner or deliberately air the conflicts in the legal team in charge of our international arbitration. Failing in these efforts, the Council decided to give petitioner an opportunity to be heard.<br><br><center><i>X<br>Final note</i></center><br>Some members of this court will have their own personal evaluation of the qualification and fitness of petitioner to be nominated for the position of Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. I am no exception.<br><br>I have benefited from the wisdom of petitioner as a colleague in the faculty of the UP College of Law. I have witnessed his appearances both orally and in writing as the Solicitor General in the many cases that passed through this court. I know of his family as well as his reputation held by many of our common friends.<br><br>Like in many cases, our decisions as Justices of this court carry the pains and burdens which we have sworn to uphold. We have to follow the results of our decisions on the issues posed before us.<br><br><b><i>It is not up to us to make judgments of the Solicitor General’s competence, integrity, probity, and independence.</i></b><br><br>A becoming modesty of this court and its own respect for the constitutional legitimacy of its existence requires that it respects and presumes competence in the constitutional organs including the Judicial and Bar Council. We should presume that it has discharged its functions with the same competence and zeal for the national interest that we have. We should not presume that we have a monopoly of an understanding of the common weal, let alone of the character of petitioner and his qualifications and fitness to become a member of this court.<br><br>Petitioner has not shown that he has vested rights to the nomination. He has not shown that the actions of the Judicial and Bar Council were arbitrary, capricious, and whimsical. He has not demonstrated that the interpretation and application by the whole Judicial and Bar Council of Rule 10, Section 2 were bereft of reason and so implausible as to impair his alleged rights. He was given the opportunity to be heard. He chose not to use the forums he was provided with to rebut the substantial basis for the invocation of the rule on integrity.<br><br>The Judicial and Bar Council, by transmitting a list without petitioner’s name, has acceded to the invocation of lack of integrity by one of its members. Excluding the vote of the Chief Justice, he was not able to garner unanimity among the remaining members of the Council as required by the rules.<br><br>The importance of fully asserting the extent of our claims to natural resources located within our continental shelves and our exclusive economic zone cannot be understated. Present and future generations of Filipinos will rely on these valid and legal claims.<br><br>It is with this in mind that we mark the heroism of our men and women in uniform especially in our Navy and in the Marines. With the least of equipment, they stand ready to defend the integrity of our claims in sometimes desolate and far-flung posts pitting post-war military equipment against the modern military might of a superpower. They stay in harm’s way knowing that their impending heroism is what our people deserve. There is no better way to characterize them and their courage except to call them heroes.<br><br>Thankfully, legal argument in the context of peaceful international arbitration and diplomacy has been deployed by the current administration. What we may lack in modern naval warfare, we make up with cogent and viable legal acumen. Considering what is at stake, the margins for legal error are understandably thin. We have spared little to get the best legal experts on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. We expect no less than vigorous, aggressive, competent representation from the lawyers of the Republic led by petitioner as Solicitor General.<br><br>The questions posed to petitioner by the Judicial and Bar Council are matters that are sensitive because these pertain to a pending case undergoing international arbitration. However, they are also public matters that needed a response.<br><br>It was within the power of petitioner to explain in executive session before the Judicial and Bar Council. He could have done so while not waiving any of his constitutional rights.<br><br>He has not done so. He chose not to. This case presents an ambiguity and an anomaly he has chosen to live with. Perhaps, this will be one of those cases that will await our history’s better judgment.<br><br><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, I vote to <b>DISMISS </b>this petition.<br><br><br><hr width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Judicial and Bar Council comment, p. 1.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id. at 1-2.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Judicial and Bar Council supplemental comment-reply, pp. 1-7.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Id., citing PCA Case No. 2013-19.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Id., citing Annex J of the comment.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Id., citing Annex F of the comment; also marked as Annex C of the petition.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Id., citing PCA Case No. 2013-19.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Id. at 2-7.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Petitioner’s reply, pp. 1-4.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Judicial and Bar Council supplemental comment-reply, p. 5.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Petition, p. 5 and Judicial and Bar Council comment, p. 3.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Annex D of petition and Annex H of comment.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Annex H of comment.
