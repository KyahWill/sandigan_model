This forest reserve was instituted by Proclamation No. 369 issued by then Governor General Dwight F.

The adverse claimants appealed to the Mines Adjudication Board.<br><br>The Mines Adjudication Board (MAB), in its decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> dated January 6, 1998, vacated the decision of the panel of arbitrators:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED</b>, the decision of the Panel of Arbitrators dated 13 June 1997 is hereby <b>VACATED</b> and a new one entered in the records of the case as follows:<br><br>1.

Consistent with the spirit of RA 7076, the Board encourages SEM and all small-scale miners to continue to negotiate in good faith and arrive at an agreement beneficial to all. In the event of SEM’s strict and full compliance with all the requirements of the Mining Act and its Implementing Rules and Regulations, and the concurrence of the small-scale miners actually occupying and actively mining the area, SEM may apply for the inclusion of portions of the areas segregated under paragraph 2 hereof, to its MPSA application.

This Board hereby segregates and declares the 729-hectare gold rush area in Mt. Diwalwal actually occupied and actively mined on or before August 1, 1987 as People’s Small-Scale Mining Area. Thereafter, the concerned local government unit through the recommendation of this Board shall issue/execute the necessary small-scale mining contract to qualified applicants upon compliance of the requisites for small scale mining under R.A. 7076 and its implementing rules and regulations.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Then DENR Secretary Antonio H.

For effective management and equitable utilization of resources, the two main areas of operations as described above of the 729 hectares shall be delineated and embodied in a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) among the stakeholders concerned to ensure recognition of delineated boundaries and rational operation of the concerned areas.<br><br>2. These two areas are divided as follows: a) <b>Block I </b>[Balete-Nang Area], composed of <u>Sub-Block A</u> and <u>Sub-Block B</u>, intended for Blucor and Helica Group of Tunnels, representing MISSMA, and for various qualified Small-Scale Miners who are actually occupying and actively mining in the area and b) <b>Block II</b> [Buenas-Tinago Area], intended for JB Management, and other qualified Small-Scale Miners who are actually occupying and actively mining in the area.<br><br>3. Qualified Small-Scale Miners in each area, as maybe determined by the PMRB, shall apply for Small Scale Mining Contracts with option thereafter to apply for an MPSA.<br><br>4. Consistent with the provisions of DENR Memorandum Order No. 99-02, mineral processing plants in the Diwalwal area shall be relocated to processing zones duly designated by the DENR where appropriate tailings disposal systems have been put in place.<br><br>5. The Natural Resources Development Corporation (NRDC), the corporate arm of the DENR, shall extend the necessary technical expertise and supervision over all mining and milling operations in the area, environmental clean-up and rehabilitation activities, and the identification of alternative livelihood activities for the families of small-scale miners and other residents in the area.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring in the original)</blockquote><br>The DENR Secretary denied reconsideration on February 2, 2000. SMGMC filed a petition under Rule 43 before the Court of Appeals.<br><br>The Court of Appeals, in its decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> dated July 31, 2000, denied the petition.<br><br>The Court of Appeals discussed that since “there being no injunction from the Supreme Court which would prevent the enforcement of the MAB decision, respondent DENR Secretary acted with propriety in issuing the assailed decision which affirmed the PMRB’s declaration of a People’s Small Scale Mining Area.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> It also denied the petition based on <i>litis pendencia</i>, considering that the pending case before this court assailing the MAB decision involved a prejudicial question.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>SMGMC and Balite Integrated Small-Scale Mining Corp. (BISSMICO) filed separate motions for reconsideration.<br><br>The Court of Appeals, in its amended decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> dated August 27, 2001, granted the motions for reconsideration and, consequently, set aside and annulled the DENR Secretary's decision for having been issued with grave abuse of discretion in excess of his jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals limited its discussion on the propriety of the DENR Secretary’s decision.<br><br>It cited at length a memorandum dated March 27, 1998 by then DENR Undersecretary, Antonio La Viña, to support its finding that SMGMC “may apply and be entitled to a particular area within the 729 hectares potential coverage of the People’s Small-Scale Mining Area, subject to the fulfilment of several conditions.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals found that the “DENR Secretary’s outright delineation of the subject area in favor of certain entities contravenes the mandate of the MAB Decision and the purpose of RA 7076 (People’s Small-Scale Mining Act of 1991), inasmuch as it disenfranchises the petitioner and other small-scale miners who may apply for and be awarded small-scale mining contracts by the local government units upon recommendation of the PMRB after the fulfilment of necessary conditions set forth in the law.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Hence, these two petitions for review were filed assailing the Court of Appeals' amended decision.<br><br>Petitioner MISSMA<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> argues that the Court of Appeals should not have amended its decision considering it already found SMGMC guilty of forum shopping and <i>litis pendencia</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Petitioner MISSMA contends that the petition docketed as G.R. No. 132475 assailing the portion of the MAB’s decision that excluded the 729-hectare area covered by DAO No. 66 from SMGMC’s Mines Production Sharing Agreement application<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> involves the same issues as the present cases. MISSMA submits that “the ultimate objective of the two cases is [SMGMC] to solely obtain all mining rights over the subject 729 hectare gold rush area, to the exclusion of MISSMA and other claimants thereon.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Petitioner MISSMA also argues that “[i]n carrying out the function of declaring and segregating gold rush areas for small-scale mining purposes [pursuant to Republic Act No. 7076], both the PMRB, and upon review, the DENR Secretary, may well act independently of the MAB, which, on the other hand is a quasi-judicial body tasked to settle mining conflicts, disputes or claims[.]”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Moreover, the DENR Secretary’s decision only delineated and identified areas available for small-scale mining contract applications. The decision did not make actual awards.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Petitioner Hon. Antonio H. Cerilles, in his capacity as then DENR Secretary,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> similarly argues that the Court of Appeals should have maintained its earlier decision dismissing the case due to forum shopping and litis pendencia.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>In any event, petitioner DENR Secretary argues that he acted within authority in modifying the PMRB’s decision, citing Sections 24 and 26 of Republic Act No. 7076 on the DENR Secretary’s power of “direct supervision and control.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Petitioner DENR Secretary adds that “[t]he division into two areas of the segregated portion of 729-hectares small-scale mining area does not contravene the mandate of the MAB decision and the purpose of R.A. No. 7076, since there is no award yet of any license or permit made to any qualified small-scale miner.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Lastly, petitioner DENR Secretary contends that these petitions have been mooted by (1) then President Macapagal-Arroyo’s issuance of Proclamation No. 297 excluding an area from Proclamation No. 369 and declaring this as a mineral reservation and as an environmentally critical area, and (2) this court’s decision dated June 23, 2006 in G.R. Nos. 152613, 152628, 152619-20, 152870-71 declaring DAO No. 66 as void, declaring EP 133 as expired, and underscoring the Executive’s power of supervision and control over the exploration, development, and utilization of the country’s mineral resources.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Respondent SMGMC counters that no forum shopping or <i>litis pendencia</i> exists as the present petitions “emanated from the decision of the PMRB declaring the 729 hectares of timberland as People’s Small-Scale Mining Area, while G.R. No. 132475 emanated from the decision of the MAB on the MPSA Application of [SMGMC].”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Records also show that the case docketed as G.R. No. 132475 was made known to this court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Respondent SMGMC quoted at length DENR Undersecretary La Viña’s memorandum on the scope of the MAB decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Respondent SMGMC submits that the DENR Secretary’s decision “practically abandoned the MAB decision and fashioned his own formula for disaster,” such as mentioning the Blucor and Helica groups which were never parties before the PMRB.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Respondent BISSMICO admits and adopts respondent SMGMC’s memorandum.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Respondent PICOP discusses the difference between “forest reserves” and “forest reservations” under Presidential Decree No. 705,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> and pursuant to Republic Act No. 3092<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> enacted on June 17, 1961, stating that “a law should now be passed by Congress in order to reclassify areas in forest reserve to another use.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Even Executive Order No. 318 issued on June 9, 2004 on guiding principles in Promoting Sustainable Forest Management in the Philippines provides that “[c]onversions of forestlands into non-forestry uses shall be allowed only through an act of Congress and upon the recommendation of concerned government agencies.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Consequently, the PMRB has no authority to declare the 729 hectares within the forest reserve as a People’s Small-Scale Mining Area.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Respondent PICOP also argues that Proclamation No. 297 by then President Macapagal-Arroyo was without congressional concurrence as required by Republic Act No. 3092, thus, revocable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Its memorandum also includes arguments on how Proclamation No. 297 was the first step in a series of constitutional violations such as an agreement with ZTE –NBN involving the gold rush area.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>By resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> dated March 4, 2013, the parties were required to file manifestations on “subsequent developments that may help this court in the immediate disposition of these cases, or that may render the cases moot and academic.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>Petitioner DENR Secretary, through its counsel Office of the Solicitor General, filed its compliance on May 16, 2013.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Petitioner DENR Secretary submitted a copy of the letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> dated April 24, 2013 of the Philippine Mining Development Corporation (PMDC), the government office in charge of the Diwalwal area, containing details of the latest development in the area.
