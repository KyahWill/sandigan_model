CV No. 51894, which required SOLIDBANK to restitute with legal interest the amount withdrawn by it from the fire insurance proceeds deposited in <i>custodia legis</i> with the RTC of Manila, are very clearly merely interlocutory orders, as they do not dispose of the appeals by Solidbank, GOYU, and MICO on the merits.&nbsp; Accordingly, a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> is not the proper remedy.&nbsp; Instead, where the assailed interlocutory order is patently erroneous and the remedy of appeal would not afford adequate and expeditious relief, the Court allows <i>certiorari</i> as a mode of redress.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; As it stands, the petition for review of SOLIDBANK is the wrong remedy and perforce should be dismissed.<br><br>On considerations of equity and liberality, this Court can treat the present petition as a Petition for <i>Certiorari </i>filed under Rule 65.&nbsp; <i>Certiorari,</i> however, requires not a mere error in judgment, but a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of or excess of jurisdiction.&nbsp; We shall now proceed to determine whether the appellate court committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing the assailed Resolutions.<br><br><b><u>Right of RCBC to intervene in <br>Civil Case No. 92-62749&nbsp; </u></b><br><br>SOLIDBANK claims that the Court of Appeals committed a grave reversible error in allowing RCBC to intervene in the assailed June 23, 1997 Resolution.&nbsp; SOLIDBANK argues that RCBC has no legal, actual and immediate interest in the matter in litigation in Civil Case No. 92-62749 on the ground that the funds withdrawn by SOLIDBANK exclusively belong to it.&nbsp; Assuming <i>arguendo </i>that intervention by RCBC is proper, SOLIDBANK maintains that the case should be remanded to the lower court for reception of evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>We disagree with the postulations of SOLIDBANK.&nbsp; This Court cannot pass upon the conflicting rights of SOLIDBANK and RCBC with respect to the insurance proceeds as this is <b>not</b> a review of the <i>Decision in the merits</i> of either CA-G.R. CV No. 46162 (appeal of Civil Case No. 93-65442) or CA-G.R. CV No. 51894 (appeal of Civil Case No. 92-62749), <b>but</b> is a review of merely an interlocutory order in the latter case.&nbsp; The trial court’s disallowance of RCBC’s intervention in the trial on the merits in Civil Case No. 92-62749 is of no moment.&nbsp; The issue in the case at bar is the propriety of the implementation of the writ of execution and notice of garnishment in Civil Case No. 92-62749 by SOLIDBANK’s withdrawal from the amount deposited pursuant to a court order in Civil Case No. 93-65442.&nbsp; RCBC’s right to intervene in CA-G.R. CV No. 51894 (the appeal of Civil Case No. 92-62749) stems from its right as a party, and now a judgment creditor, in Civil Case No. 93-65442, the case where the funds executed on was in <i>custodia legis</i>.&nbsp; Accordingly, neither this Court, nor the lower court (in SOLIDBANK’s proposed remanding of the case), should receive new evidence on the conflicting rights of SOLIDBANK and RCBC with respect to the insurance proceeds.<br><br><b><u>Right of SOLIDBANK to withdraw <br>from the amount in <i>custodia legis</i> in<br>Civil Case No. 93-65442&nbsp; </u></b><br><br>When the proceeds of fire insurance policy numbers F-114-07402 and F-114-07525 were placed under <i>custodia legis</i> of Branch 3 of the RTC of Manila in Civil Case No. 93-65442,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> they were placed under the sole control of such court beyond the interference of all other co-ordinate courts.&nbsp; We have held that property attached or garnished by a court falls into the <i>custodia legis </i>of that court for the purposes of <b>that civil case only</b>.&nbsp; Any relief against such attachment and the execution and issuance of a writ of possession that ensued subsequently could be disposed of only in that case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>This long-standing jurisprudence was applied in 2002 in <i>Yau v. The Manila Banking Corporation.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; In said case, Esteban Yau was the judgment creditor of Ricardo Silverio by virtue of the final and executory decision of the RTC of Cebu in Civil Case No. CEB-2058.&nbsp; Yau learned that the only asset of Silverio that can be found for the satisfaction of the judgment was his proprietary membership share in the Manila Golf and Country Club (Manila Golf), which was already subject to a prior levy on preliminary attachment obtained by Manila Banking Corporation (Manilabank) in Civil Case Nos. 90-513 and 90-271 in the RTC of Makati.&nbsp; The sheriff in the Cebu case nevertheless levied on the Siverio share.&nbsp; Yau emerged as the highest bidder at the public auction sale and the corresponding Certificate of Sale was issued in his name.&nbsp; When Manila Golf refused Yau’s request to be issued a certificate of proprietary membership share, Yau filed a motion in Civil Case No. CEB-2058 to direct such issuance, which was granted by the RTC of Cebu.&nbsp; Without filing a motion for reconsideration, Manilabank filed a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> with the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals granted the petition and nullified the Order of the RTC of Cebu.&nbsp; This Court, in affirming the Decision of the Court of Appeals, held that the Order of the RTC of Cebu was a patent nullity:<br><br><blockquote>This Court has settled that as a general rule, the filing of a motion for reconsideration is a condition <i>sine qua non</i> in order that <i>certiorari</i> shall lie. However, there are settled exceptions to this Rule, one of which is where the assailed order is a patent nullity, as where the court a quo has no jurisdiction, which is evident in this case.<br><br>The Notice of Garnishment of the Silverio share upon Manila Golf brought the property into the<i> custodia legis</i> of the court issuing the writ, that is, the RTC Makati City Branch 64, beyond the interference of all other co-ordinate courts, such as the RTC of Cebu, Branch 6. “The garnishment of property operates as an attachment and fastens upon the property a lien by which the property is brought under the jurisdiction of the court issuing the writ.&nbsp; It is brought into<i> custodia legis,</i> under the sole control of such court.&nbsp; A court which has control of such property, exercises exclusive jurisdiction over the same, retains all incidents relative to the conduct of such property.&nbsp; No court, except one having supervisory control or superior jurisdiction in the premises, has a right to interfere with and change that possession.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> (Citations omitted.)</blockquote><br>In the case at bar, therefore, the order to deposit the proceeds of fire insurance policy numbers F-114-07402 and F-114-07525 brought the amount garnished into the<i> custodia legis </i>of the court issuing said order, that is, the RTC of Manila, Branch 3, beyond the interference of all other co-ordinate courts, such as the RTC of Manila, Branch 14.&nbsp; Accordingly, just as the sheriff in <i>Yau </i>was found to have improperly levied on the garnished share in Manila Golf, the act of the sheriff in Civil Case No. 92-62749 in the case at bar in levying on the deposited insurance proceeds was likewise a patent nullity.&nbsp; Citing <i>Parco v. Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> we further held in <i>Yau</i> that while jurisdiction is vested in the court and not in any particular branch or judge:<br><br><blockquote>[A]s a corollary rule, the various branches of the Court of First Instance [now RTC] of a judicial district are a coordinate and co-equal courts [where] one branch stands on the same level as the other.&nbsp; Undue interference by one on the proceedings and processes of another is prohibited by law. In the language of this Court, the various branches of the Court of First Instance of a province or city, having as they have the same or equal authority and exercising as they do concurrent and coordinate jurisdiction should not, cannot, and are not permitted to interfere with their respective cases, much less with their orders or judgments.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></blockquote><br>We further note that the October 12, 1993 Order of Branch 3 directing MICO to deposit with the court the proceeds of the 10 fire insurance policies even explicitly provided:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, defendant Malayan Insurance Corp., Inc., is hereby directed to deposit in Court the proceeds for the ten (10) fire insurance policies purchased from them by plaintiff, to wit:<br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>9. Policy No. F-114-07402<br><br>10. Policy No. F-114-07525.<br></blockquote>after deducting the amount of P14,938,085.23 therefrom, immediately upon receipt of this order, <b><u>withdrawal of which shall not be allowed except upon order of this court.</u></b><br><br>Whatever legal fees is required relative to this deposit shall be deducted from the interest of the amount deposited upon withdrawal of the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote><br>In what appears to be an attempt to mislead this Court, SOLIDBANK furthermore argues<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> that the Court of Appeals completely disregarded the certification issued by MICO which stated that “[s]aid amount of Php 23,070,730.83 forms part of the above-listed sums deposited in <i>custodia legis </i>x x x awaiting final judgment in Civil Case No. 92-62749, RTC-Manila Br. 14.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>There is no question that the funds were deposited in court pursuant to the Order of Branch 3 of the RTC of Manila in Civil Case No. 93-65442.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; SOLIDBANK does not dispute this fact, nor even claim that the funds were deposited pursuant to an order of Branch 14 in Civil Case No. 92-62749.<br><br>Finally, SOLIDBANK assails the April 28, 2000 Resolution of the Court of Appeals for taking judicial notice of the Decision of this Court in G.R. Nos. 128833, 128834 and 128866, arguing that SOLIDBANK is not a party thereto and should not be bound by the judgment therein.<br><br>Far from making SOLIDBANK bound by the judgment in Civil Case No. 93-65442 (CA-G.R. CV No. 46162 in the Court of Appeals; G.R. Nos. 128833, 128834 and 128866 in this Court), the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 51894 (Civil Case No. 92-62749 in the trial court) actually strictly enforced the delineation of the two cases when it found the levy in Civil Case No. 92-62749 of the garnished insurance proceeds in Civil Case No. 93-65442 to be improper and ordered the restitution of the amount withdrawn by SOLIDBANK.&nbsp; As discussed above, <b>SOLIDBANK has no right to withdraw</b> from the amount in <i>custodia legis</i> in Civil Case No. 93-65442, not because SOLIDBANK is bound by the judgment therein (which it is not), but <b>precisely because it is not a party in said case.</b>&nbsp; The property garnished is under the sole control of the court in Civil Case No. 93-65442 for the purposes of that civil case only.&nbsp; This is true as long as the property remains in <i>custodia legis </i>in Civil Case No. 93-65442, regardless of even whether this Court has rendered a Decision in the appeal of said case.<br><br>In view of all the foregoing, we find that the Court of Appeals was not in error, much less in grave abuse of discretion, when it found the levy in Civil Case No. 92-62749 of the garnished insurance proceeds in Civil Case No. 93-65442 to be improper and ordered the restitution of the amount withdrawn by SOLIDBANK.&nbsp; Accordingly, the present petition should be denied.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the present Petition for Review on<i> Certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court is <b>DENIED</b> for lack of merit.&nbsp; The Resolutions of the Court of Appeals dated June 23, 1997 and April 28, 2000 in CA-G.R.
