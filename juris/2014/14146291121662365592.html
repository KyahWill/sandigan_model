The OSG argues that the COMELEC did not commit any grave abuse of discretion since Osmeña was able to adduce substantial evidence to prove that he was a resident of Toledo City at least one (1) year before the May 2013 elections.<br><br><center><b><u>The Court’s Ruling</u></b></center><br><b>We dismiss the petition for lack of merit.<br><br><i>Limited Review in Certiorari Petitions</i></b><br><br>“Grave abuse of discretion” defies exact definition; generally, it refers to “capricious or whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction;” the abuse of discretion must be patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law, or to act at all in contemplation of law, as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary and despotic manner by reason of passion and hostility.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Mere abuse of discretion is not enough; it must be grave.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> We have held, too, that the use of <i>wrong or irrelevant considerations </i>in deciding an issue is sufficient to taint a decision-maker's action with grave abuse of discretion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Closely related with the limited focus of the present petition is the condition, under Section 5, Rule 64 of the Rules of Court, that<i> findings of fact of the COMELEC, supported by substantial evidence, shall be final and non-reviewable.</i> Substantial evidence is that degree of evidence that <i>a reasonable mind</i> might accept to support a conclusion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> In light of our limited authority to review findings of fact, we do not <i>ordinarily </i>review in a <i>certiorari</i> case the COMELEC's appreciation and evaluation of evidence. Any misstep by the COMELEC in this regard generally involves an error of judgment, not of jurisdiction.<br><br>In exceptional cases, however, when the COMELEC's action on the appreciation and evaluation of evidence oversteps the limits of its discretion to the point of being grossly unreasonable, the Court is not only obliged, but has the constitutional duty to intervene.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> When grave abuse of discretion is present, resulting errors arising from the grave abuse <i>mutate</i> from error of judgment to one of jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br><b><i>Nature of the Case Subject of the Petition</i></b><br><br>The present petition arose from a<b><i> petition to deny due course or to cancel Osmeña’s COC.</i></b><br><br>Section 74, in relation with Section 78 of the Omnibus Election Code governs the cancellation of, and grant or denial of due course to, the COCs. The combined application of these sections requires that the facts stated in the COC by the would-be candidate be true, as any false representation of a material fact is a ground for the COC’s cancellation or the withholding of due course. To quote these provisions:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 74. <b><i>Contents of certificate of candidacy. </i></b>- The certificate of candidacy shall state that the person filing it is announcing his candidacy for the office stated therein and that he is eligible for said office; if for Member of the Batasang Pambansa, the province, including its component cities, highly urbanized city or district or sector which he seeks to represent; the political party to which he belongs; civil status; his date of birth; residence; his post office address for all election purposes; his profession or occupation; that he will support and defend the Constitution of the Philippines and will maintain true faith and allegiance thereto; that he will obey the laws, legal orders, and decrees promulgated by the duly constituted authorities; that he is not a permanent resident or immigrant to a foreign country; that the obligation assumed by his oath is assumed voluntarily, without mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and <b>that the facts stated in the certificate of candidacy are true to the best of his knowledge.</b> (Emphasis ours)<br><br>x x x x<br><br>SEC. 78. <b><i>Petition to deny due course to or cancel a certificate of candidacy.</i></b> - A verified petition seeking to deny due course or to cancel a certificate of candidacy may be filed by any person exclusively on the ground that any material representation contained therein as required under Section 74 hereof is false. The petition may be filed at any time not later than twenty-five days from the time of the filing of the certificate of candidacy and shall be decided, after due notice and hearing, not later than fifteen days before the election.</blockquote><br>The false representation that these provisions mention pertains to a material fact, not to a mere innocuous mistake.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> This is emphasized by the consequences of any material falsity: a candidate who falsifies a material fact cannot run; if he runs and is elected, cannot serve; in both cases, he or she can be prosecuted for violation of the election laws.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Obviously, these facts are those that refer to a candidate’s qualifications for elective office, such as his or her citizenship and residence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>Separate from the requirement of materiality, a false representation under Section 78 must consist of a “deliberate attempt to mislead, misinform, or hide a fact, which would otherwise render a candidate ineligible.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup>&nbsp; In other words, it must be made with the intention to deceive the electorate as to the would-be candidate's qualifications for public office. In <i>Mitra v. COMELEC</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> we held that the misrepresentation that Section 78 addresses cannot be the result of a mere innocuous mistake, and cannot exist in a situation where the intent to deceive is patently absent, or where no deception of the electorate results. The deliberate character of the misrepresentation necessarily follows from a consideration of the consequences of any material falsity: a candidate who falsifies a material fact cannot run.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br><b><i>No grave abuse of discretion<br>on the part of COMELEC</i></b><br><br>To establish a new domicile of choice, personal presence in the place must be coupled with conduct indicative of this intention. It requires not only such bodily presence in that place but also a declared and probable intent to make it one’s fixed and permanent place of abode.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>The critical issue, however, pertains to Osmeña’s bodily presence in Toledo City and the declaration he made in his COC on this point. The petitioners claim that Osmeña was only seen in Toledo City in the month of September 2012 to conduct political meetings. They also stress that the dilapidated property in Ibo, Toledo City is not even owned by Osmeña, and is not in keeping with the latter’s stature — a former Senator and a member of a political clan.<br><br>In support of their contention, the petitioners submitted various affidavits of Toledo City residents claiming that Osmeña was never seen in Toledo<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> and pictures of the dilapidated Ibo, Toledo City property. Osmeña, meanwhile submitted photographs of the Ibo, Toledo City property, and various affidavits confirming his residence for more than one year in Toledo City.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Under these seemingly directly contradictory evidence, we find that the COMELEC did not commit any grave abuse of discretion in upholding the residency of Osmeña.<br><br>As the COMELEC aptly found, Osmeña had sufficiently established by substantial evidence his residence in Toledo City, Cebu.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> As early as April 24, 2006,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Osmeña applied for the transfer of his voter’s registration record to Toledo City, which was granted on April 24, 2012.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> Osmeña likewise purchased a parcel of land in Ibo, Toledo City in 1995 and commenced the construction of an improvement, which would eventually serve as his residence since 2004.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> Osmeña even acquired another parcel of land<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> in Das, Toledo City in December 2011<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> and transferred his headquarters to Poblacion<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> and Bato, Toledo City as early as 2011. <b>The existence of Osmeña’s headquarters in Bato, Toledo City, was even confirmed by the Mr. Orlando Pama Casia, witness for the petitioners.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> Finally, Osmeña has always maintained profound political and socio-civic linkages in Toledo City—a fact that the petitioners never disputed.<br><br>The petitioners, in the present case, largely rely on statements that Osmeña was “hardly seen” in Toledo City, Cebu to support their claim of error of jurisdiction. These affidavits, however, deserve little consideration and loudly speak of their inherent weakness as evidence.<br><br>The law does not require a person to be in his home twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week, to fulfill the residency requirement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> In <i>Fernandez v. House Electoral Tribunal</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> we ruled that the “fact that a few barangay health workers attested that they had failed to see petitioner whenever they allegedly made the rounds in Villa de Toledo is of no moment, especially considering that there were witnesses (including petitioner's neighbors in Villa de Toledo) that were in turn presented by petitioner to prove that he was actually a resident of Villa de Toledo, in the address he stated in his COC. x x x It may be that whenever these health workers do their rounds petitioner was out of the house to attend to his own employment or business.”<br><br><b>Under the circumstances, the evidence submitted by the petitioners do not conclusively prove that Osmeña did not in fact reside in Toledo City for at least the year before election day; most especially since the sworn statements of some Toledo City residents attesting that they never saw Osmeña in Toledo City were controverted by similar sworn statements by other Toledo City residents who claimed that Osmeña resided in Toledo City.</b><br><br>Similarly, the fact that Osmeña has no registered property under his name does not belie his actual residence in Toledo City because property ownership is not among the qualifications required of candidates for local election.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> It is enough that he should live in the locality, even in a rented house or that of a friend or relative.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> To use ownership of property in the district as the determinative indicium of permanence of domicile or residence implies that only the landed can establish compliance with the residency requirement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> In <i>Perez v. COMELEC</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> we sustained the COMELEC when it considered as evidence tending to establish a candidate’s domicile of choice the mere lease (rather than ownership) of an apartment by a candidate in the same province where he ran for the position of governor.<br><br>We cannot accord credence either to the petitioners’ contention that the dilapidated house in Ibo, Toledo City, could not serve as Osmeña’s residence in view of the latter’s stature. At the outset, the photographs submitted by Osmeña in evidence show that <b>the house is modestly furnished and contains the comforts of a simple abode</b>. Moreover, the petitioners’ <b>speculation involves the use of subjective non-legal standards, which we previously condemned</b> in the case of <i>Mitra v. Commission on Elections</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup>&nbsp; In Mitra,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> we pronounced:<br><br><blockquote>The respondents significantly ask us in this case to adopt the same faulty approach of using subjective norms, as they now argue that given his stature as a member of the prominent Mitra clan of Palawan, and as a three term congressman, it is highly incredible that a small room in a feed mill has served as his residence since 2008.<br><br>We reject this suggested approach outright for the same reason we condemned the COMELEC's use of subjective non-legal standards. <b>Mitra's feed mill dwelling cannot be considered in isolation and separately from the circumstances of his transfer of residence, specifically, his expressed intent to transfer to a residence outside of Puerto Princesa City to make him eligible to run for a provincial position; his preparatory moves starting in early 2008; his initial transfer through a leased dwelling; the purchase of a lot for his permanent home; and the construction of a house in this lot that, parenthetically, is adjacent to the premises he leased pending the completion of his house</b>. These incremental moves do not offend reason at all, in the way that the COMELEC's highly subjective non-legal standards do. (Emphasis ours)</blockquote><br>Osmeña’s actual physical presence in Toledo City is established not only by the presence of a place (Ibo, Toledo City, house and lot) he can actually live in, but also the affidavits of various persons in Toledo City. Osmeña’s substantial and real interest in establishing his domicile of choice in Toledo City is also sufficiently shown not only by the acquisition of additional property in the area and the transfer of his voter registration and headquarters, but also his participation in the community’s socio-civic and political activities.<br><br><b><i>Osmeña has been proclaimed winner <br>in the electoral contest and has therefore<br> the mandate of the electorate</i></b><br><br>Before his transfer of residence, Osmeña already had intimate knowledge of Toledo City, particularly of the whole 3rd legislative district that he represented for one term. Thus, he manifests a significant level of knowledge of and sensitivity to the needs of the said community. Moreover, Osmeña won the mayoralty position as the choice of the people of Toledo City.<br><br>We find it apt to reiterate in this regard the principle enunciated in the case of <i>Frivaldo v. Comelec</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> that “[i]n any action involving the possibility of a reversal of the popular electoral choice, this Court must exert utmost effort to resolve the issues in a manner that would give effect to the will of the majority, for it is merely sound public policy to cause elective offices to be filled by those who are the choice of the majority.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br><br>To successfully challenge a winning candidate’s qualifications, the petitioner must clearly demonstrate that the ineligibility is so patently antagonistic to constitutional and legal principles that overriding such ineligibility and thereby giving effect to the apparent will of the people would ultimately create greater prejudice to the very democratic institutions and juristic traditions that our Constitution and laws so zealously protect and promote.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup>&nbsp; The reason for such liberality stems from the recognition that laws governing election contests must be construed to the end that the will of the people in the choice of public officials may not be defeated by mere technical objections.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup><br><br>Nonetheless, we wish to remind that COC defects <i>beyond matters of form</i> and that involve <i>material misrepresentations</i> cannot avail of the benefit of our ruling that COC mandatory requirements before elections are considered merely directory after the people shall have spoken.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> Where a <i>material COC misrepresentation under oath</i> is made, thereby violating both our election and criminal laws, we are faced as well with an assault on the will of the people of the Philippines as expressed in our laws.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup>&nbsp; In a choice between provisions on material qualifications of elected officials, on the one hand, and the will of the electorate in any given locality, on the other, we believe and so hold that we cannot choose the electorate’s will.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br><br>With the conclusion that Osmeña did not commit any material misrepresentation in his COC, we see no reason in this case to appeal to the primacy of the electorate’s will. We cannot deny, however, that the people of Toledo City have spoken in an election where residency qualification had been squarely raised and their voice has erased any doubt about their verdict on Osmeña’s qualifications.<br><br><b><i>The petitioners failed to substantiate<br>their claim of partiality on the part<br>of the COMELEC in admitting Osmeña’s<br>Answer, Amended Memorandum</i></b><br><br>Lastly, the petitioners insist that the COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion in admitting Osmeña’s belatedly filed Answer, Amended Memorandum and Supplemental Memorandum. The petitioners, however, failed to substantiate this allegation in their petition. In fact, the petitioners admitted that they <b>do not exactly know when Osmeña was served with summons by the clerk or commission</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> They only <b>speculated</b> that Osmeña’s Answer was filed one day delayed.<br><br>Similarly, we do not find any error on the part of the COMELEC in allowing the filing of Osmeña’s <b>amended</b> memorandum, after obtaining leave from the COMELEC. As Osmeña aptly pleaded in his motion for leave, the amendments consisted of mere <b>technical errors</b>; the lower portions and the most crucial parts of the Memorandum <b>were omitted in its final printing</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> <b>because the printer was inadvertently configured to use an incorrect paper size</b>.<br><br>Moreover, amendments are actually favored in order to allow the complete presentation of the real controversies. We had this to say in this regard in <i>Contech Construction Technology and Dev’t Corp. v. Court of Appeals</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup><br><br><blockquote>“It is a recognized rule of procedure that pleadings shall be construed liberally so as to render substantial justice to the parties and in order that actual merits of the controversy may speedily be determined without regard to technicalities and in the most expeditious and inexpensive manner. The judicial attitude has always been favorable and liberal in allowing amendments to a pleading. The rationale behind the rule is to avoid multiplicity of suits and in order that the real controversies between the parties are presented, their rights are determined and the case decided on the merits without unnecessary delay. When the situation is such that if the proposed amendment is not allowed, another action would be instituted, thus making two actions, two trials, and two appeals possible and probable, the said amendment should be admitted. Hence, should the trial court find the allegations in the pleadings to be inadequate, it should allow the party concerned to file proper amendments to pleadings in accordance with the mandate of the Rules of Court that amendments to pleadings are favored and should be liberally allowed.”</blockquote><br>In these lights, we can only conclude, in the context of the cancellation proceeding before us, that the petitioners have not presented a convincing case sufficient to show that the COMELEC committed an error of jurisdiction in upholding the residency of Osmeña in Toledo City and the validity of his representation on this point in his COC.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, we hereby <b>DISMISS</b> the petition for lack of merit.
