				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Before this Court is an appeal from a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated July 29, 2011 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR.-H.C. No. 04265, entitled <i>People of the Philippines v.

Upon reaching San Jose del Monte Elementary School, appellant Joel Aquino together with Noynoy Almoguera a.k.a. Negro, Rodnal, Bing, John Doe and Peter Doe boarded the tricycle. Noynoy Almoguera instructed the victim to proceed to the nipa hut owned by appellant.<br><br>Upon reaching the said nipa hut, Jesus Lita, appellant and his companions had a shabu session while Jefferson was watching TV. After using shabu, Noynoy Almoguera demanded from the victim to pay Five Hundred Pesos (P500.00), but the victim said that he had no money. Appellant shouted at the victim demanding him to pay. Bing suggested to her companions that they leave the nipa hut. Thus, the victim mounted his tricycle and started the engine. Noynoy Almoguera and John Doe rode in the tricycle behind the victim while appellant and Rodnal rode in the sidecar with Jefferson [sitting] at the toolbox of the tricycle. Inside the tricycle, appellant pointed a knife at Jefferson while Noynoy Almoguera stabbed the victim’s side. After the victim was stabbed, he was transferred inside the tricycle while appellant drove the tricycle to his friend’s house where they again stabbed the victim using the latter’s own knife. Then they loaded the victim to the tricycle and drove to a grassy area where appellant and his companions dumped the body of the victim. Thereafter, they returned to appellant’s residence. Jefferson told the sister of appellant about the death of his father but the sister of appellant only told him to sleep.<br><br>The next day, Jefferson was brought to the jeepney terminal where he rode a jeepney to get home. Jefferson told his mother, Ma. Theresa Calitisan-Lita, about the death of his father.<br><br>In the meantime, SPO3 Servillano Lactao Cabading received a call from Barangay Captain Danilo Rogelio of Barangay San Rafael IV, San Jose Del Monte City, Bulacan thru the two (2) way radio, that the body of a male person with several stab wounds was found dead on a grassy area beside the road of the said barangay. Immediately, SPO3 Cabading together with a police aide proceeded to the area. Thereat, they found the dead body whom they identified thru his Driver’s License in his wallet as Jesus Lita, the victim. Also recovered were a big stainless ice pick about 18 inches long including the handle and a tricycle key. The police officers brought the body of the victim to the Sapang Palay District Hospital. Thereafter, they proceeded to the address of the victim.<br><br>Ma. Theresa Calitisan-Lita and Jefferson were about to leave for the morgue when they met SPO3 Cabading outside their residence. SPO3 Cabading informed Ma. Theresa that the body of the victim was found in Barangay San Rafael IV. Jefferson told SPO3 Cabading that he was with his father at the time of his death and he brought the police officers to the place where his father was stabbed and to the hut owned by appellant. Thereat, the police officers recovered a maroon colored knife case and the sandals of the victim. Appellant was invited to the police station for questioning but he refused alleging that he does not know anything about the incident. The police officers were able to obtain a picture of appellant which was shown to Jefferson and he positively identified the same as “Akong” one of those who stabbed his father. Likewise, a video footage of Noynoy Almoguera alias “Negro” was shown to Jefferson and he likewise identified the person in the video footage as the same “Negro” who also stabbed his father.<br><br>Dr. Richard Ivan Viray, medico-legal, who conducted an autopsy on the victim, concluded that cause of death is Hemorrhagic Shock due to multiple stab wounds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote><br>However, appellant held a different version of the events of this case. In his Appellant’s Brief, the succeeding account is entered:<br><br><blockquote>[Appellant] denied the accusations against him. On September 6, 2002, he was working as a laborer/mason in the construction of his uncle’s (Rene Cendana) house located at Area C, Acacia Homes, Cavite, together with Paul Maglaque, Eman Lozada, Raul Lozada and Lorenzo Cendana. They worked from 7:30 x x x in the morning until 4:30 x x x in the afternoon, with lunch and “merienda” breaks from 11:30 x x x to 12:00 o’clock noon and 3:00 o’clock to 3:15 x x x in the afternoon, respectively. After work, they just stayed in their barracks located within their workplace. They would prepare their food and take supper at around 7:00 o’clock to 7:30 x x x in the evening, after which, they would smoke cigarettes. They would go to bed at around 8:00 o’clock to 9:00 o’clock in the evening.<br><br>He goes home to Sapang Palay, San Jose Del Monte City, Bulacan every Saturday. During Mondays, he would leave their house at around 4:00 o’clock to 5:00 o’clock in the morning and would arrive at his workplace at around 8:00 o’clock or 9:00 o’clock in the morning.<br><br>[Appellant] does not know either Ma. Theresa Lita, his son Jefferson, or the victim Jesus Lita. Also, he does not know a certain Noynoy Almoguera and alias Rodnal. Likewise, he denied using illegal drugs (i.e., shabu).<br><br>[Appellant] knew SPO3 Cabading because the former had served as a police aide to him since he was seventeen (17) years old. He had no misunderstanding with the police officer. He cannot think of any reason why Ma. Theresa Lita and Jefferson pointed to him as one of the perpetrators of the subject crimes.<br><br>Paul Maglague (Paul) corroborated [appellant’s] testimony. On September 6, 2002, a Friday, [appellant] was working with him, together with Roldan Lozada and Oweng Cendana, at Area C, Dasmariñas, Cavite, in the construction of Boy Cendana’s house, Paul’s brother-in-law. Paul was the cement mixer while [appellant], being his partner, carries it to wherever it is needed. Their work ends at 5:00 o’clock in the afternoon. After their work, they just stayed in their barracks located within their workplace. [Appellant] was their cook. They usually sleep at around 8:00 o’clock to 9:00 o’clock in the evening. They get their pay only during Saturdays. Hence, they would go home to Bulacan every Saturday.<br><br>At around 6:00 o’clock to 7:00 o’clock in the evening of September 7, 2002, they left Cavite and went to their respective homes in Bulacan.<br><br>On the night of September 5, 2002, [appellant] slept together with Paul and their other co-workers inside their barracks. Paul woke up in the middle of the night to urinate and was not able to see whether the accused was there, as there were no lights in the place where they were sleeping. The following morning, [appellant] was the one who cooked their food.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> (Citations omitted.)</blockquote><br>At the conclusion of trial, a guilty verdict was handed down by the trial court on both criminal charges.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the assailed September 18, 2009 Decision states:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in Criminal Case No. 483-M-2003, the Court finds the Accused JOEL AQUINO alias “Akong” guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder and hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua. The Court hereby orders the accused JOEL AQUINO to pay the heirs of Jesus Lita, the expenses incurred in his burial and funeral services in the total amount of Sixty Thousand One Hundred (P60,100.00) Pesos as actual damages, the sum of Fifty Thousand (P50,000.00) Pesos as moral damages, and P30,000.00 as exemplary damages.<br><br>In Criminal Case No. 484-M-2003, the Court likewise finds the accused JOEL AQUINO alias “Akong” guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating R.A. 6539, otherwise known as the Anti-Carnapping Law, and hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of Life Imprisonment pursuant to Section 14 of the said R.A. 6539. The said accused is also ordered to pay the amount of Sixty[-]Five Thousand Eight Hundred Seventy[-]Five (P65,875.00) Pesos representing the total installment payments of the Motorcycle.<br><br>The accused is also ordered to pay costs of this suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></blockquote><br>Insisting on his innocence, appellant filed an appeal with the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; However, the appellate court upheld the judgment of the trial court along with some modifications.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the assailed July 29, 2011 Decision of the Court of Appeals, in turn, reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the appealed Decision is hereby MODIFIED, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>a)&nbsp; In Criminal Case No. 483-M-2003, appellant is sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua without eligibility for parole. Appellant is ordered to pay the heirs of the victim actual damages in the sum of P60,100.00, duly proven during the trial, P75,000.00 civil indemnity, P75,000.00 moral damages and P30,000.00 exemplary damages.<br><br>b)&nbsp; In Criminal Case No. 484-M-2003, appellant is sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment of Fourteen (14) years and Eight (8) months, as minimum, to Seventeen (17) years and Four (4) months, as maximum and to pay the sum of P65,875.00 representing the total installment payments of the motorcycle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote></blockquote><br>Hence, appellant seeks the Court’s favorable action on the instant appeal.&nbsp; In his Brief, appellant reiterated the following errors allegedly committed by the trial court when it adjudged him guilty of the charges leveled against him:<br><blockquote><center><br>I<br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIMES CHARGED.<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE ALLEGED LONE EYEWITNESS POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT AS ONE OF THE PERPETRATORS OF THE CRIMES.<br><center><br>III<br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING THAT TREACHERY ATTENDED THE KILLING.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote><br>Appellant challenges his conviction by arguing that the trial court was not able to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt because it only relied on the incredible and inconsistent testimony of Jefferson Lita – the sole eyewitness presented by the prosecution.&nbsp; He contends that if Jefferson was indeed present during the murder of his father, Jesus Lita, then it would be highly inconceivable that Jefferson would have lived to tell that tale since he would most likely be also killed by the perpetrators being an eyewitness to the crime.&nbsp; Furthermore, appellant maintains that he cannot possibly have committed the crimes attributed to him because, on the night that Jesus was murdered, he was asleep in the barracks of a construction site somewhere in Dasmariñas City, Cavite.<br><br>We are not persuaded.<br><br>It is settled in jurisprudence that, absent any showing that the lower court overlooked circumstances which would overturn the final outcome of the case, due respect must be made to its assessment and factual findings, moreover, such findings, when affirmed by the Court of Appeals, are generally binding and conclusive upon this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; After a thorough examination of the records of this case, we find no compelling reason to doubt the veracity of the findings and conclusions made by the trial court.<br><br>With regard to appellant’s inquiry into the credibility of the lone eyewitness of the prosecution, we depend upon the principle that the trial court is in a better position to adjudge the credibility of a witness.&nbsp; In <i>People v. Vergara</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> we elaborated on this premise in this wise:<br><br><blockquote>When it comes to the matter of credibility of a witness, settled are the guiding rules some of which are that (1) the [a]ppellate court will not disturb the factual findings of the lower [c]ourt, unless there is a showing that it had overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied some fact or circumstance of weight and substance that would have affected the result of the case, which showing is absent herein; (2) the findings of the [t]rial [c]ourt pertaining to the credibility of a witness is entitled to great respect since it had the opportunity to examine his demeanor as he testified on the witness stand, and, therefore, can discern if such witness is telling the truth or not; and (3) a witness who testifies in a categorical, straightforward, spontaneous and frank manner and remains consistent on cross-examination is a credible witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></blockquote><br>Jurisprudence also tells us that when a testimony is given in a candid and straightforward manner, there is no room for doubt that the witness is telling the truth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; A perusal of the testimony of Jefferson indicates that he testified in a manner that satisfies the aforementioned test of credibility.&nbsp; More importantly, during his time at the witness stand, Jefferson positively and categorically identified appellant as one of the individuals who stabbed his father.<br><br>We quote the relevant portions of Jefferson’s detailed testimony:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan="2" valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">[PROSECUTOR CARAIG] </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP" width="5%"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP" width="95%"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">Q </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">Why do you know that your father died on the early morning of September 6, 2002, in Sapang Palay, San Jose del Monte?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">x x x x</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">A </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">Because we left the house together at 8:30 in the evening, and my father looked at the calendar.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">Q </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">You said you were with your father.

serious accusation, appellant puts forward the defense of alibi.&nbsp; We have held that for the defense of alibi to prosper, the accused must prove not only that he was at some other place at the time of the commission of the crime, but also that it was physically impossible for him to be at the <i>locus delicti</i> or within its immediate vicinity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; These requirements of time and place must be strictly met.&nbsp; A review of the evidence presented by appellant reveals that it falls short of the standard set by jurisprudence.&nbsp; Appellant failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that it was physically impossible for him to be at San Jose Del Monte City, Bulacan when Jesus was murdered.&nbsp; His own testimony revealed that the distance between the <i>locus delicti</i> and Dasmariñas City, Cavite is only a four to five hour regular commute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, it would not be physically impossible for him to make the round trip between those two points from dusk till dawn of September 5-6, 2002 and still have more than enough time to participate in the events surrounding the murder of Jesus.<br><br>Furthermore, the only person that could corroborate appellant’s alibi is his friend and former co-worker, Paul Maglaque.&nbsp; However, we have consistently assigned less probative weight to a defense of alibi when it is corroborated by friends and relatives since we have established in jurisprudence that, in order for corroboration to be credible, the same must be offered preferably by disinterested witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; Clearly, due to his friendship with appellant, Maglaque cannot be considered as a disinterested witness.<br><br>Nevertheless, it is jurisprudentially settled that positive identification prevails over alibi since the latter can easily be fabricated and is inherently unreliable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; It is likewise settled that where there is nothing to indicate that a witness for the prosecution was actuated by improper motive, the presumption is that he was not so actuated and his testimony is entitled to full faith and credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; In the case at bar, no allegation was made nor proven to show that Jefferson had any ill motive to falsely testify against appellant.<br><br>With regard to appellant’s argument that Jefferson would surely have also been killed by his father’s murderers had he indeed witnessed the crime, we can only surmise and speculate on this point.&nbsp; Whatever may be the killers’ motivation to spare Jefferson’s life remains a mystery.&nbsp; Nonetheless, it does not adversely affect what has been clearly established in this case and that is the cold-blooded murder of Jesus by a group of assailants which includes herein appellant.<br><br>According to jurisprudence, to be convicted of murder, the following must be established: (1) a person was killed; (2) the accused killed him; (3) the killing was with the attendance of any of the qualifying circumstances under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code; and (4) the killing neither constitutes parricide nor infanticide.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Contrary to appellant’s assertion, the qualifying circumstance of treachery did attend the killing of Jesus.&nbsp; We have consistently held that treachery is present when the offender commits any of the crimes against persons, employing means, methods, or forms in the execution, which tend directly and specially to insure its execution, without risk to the offender arising from the defense which the offended party might make.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; On this point, we quote with approval the Court of Appeals’ discussion of this aspect of the case, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>The essence of treachery is the sudden and unexpected attack by the aggressor on an unsuspecting victim, depriving him of any real chance to defend himself. Even when the victim was forewarned of the danger to his person, treachery may still be appreciated since what is decisive is that the execution of the attack made it impossible for the victim to defend himself or to retaliate. Records disclose that Jesus was stabbed by the group on the lateral part of his body while he was under the impression that they were simply leaving the place where they had [a] <i>shabu</i> session. Judicial notice can be taken that when the tricycle driver is seated on the motorcycle, his head is usually higher or at the level of the roof of the side car which leaves his torso exposed to the passengers who are seated in the side car. Hence, there was no way for Jesus to even be forewarned of the intended stabbing of his body both from the people seated in the side car and those seated behind him. Thus, the trial court’s finding of treachery should be affirmed. There is treachery when the means, methods, and forms of execution gave the person attacked no opportunity to defend himself or to retaliate; and such means, methods, and forms of execution were deliberately and consciously adopted by the accused without danger to his person. What is decisive in an appreciation of treachery is that the execution of the attack made it impossible for the victim to defend himself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> (Citations omitted.)</blockquote><br>However, in contrast to the pronouncements of both the trial court and the Court of Appeals, we cannot consider abuse of superior strength as an aggravating circumstance in this case.&nbsp; As per jurisprudence, when the circumstance of abuse of superior strength concurs with treachery, the former is absorbed in the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; Since there is no aggravating or mitigating circumstance present, the proper penalty is <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, in accordance with Article 63 paragraph 2 of the Revised Penal Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> it being the lesser penalty between the two indivisible penalties for the felony of murder which is reclusion perpetua to death.<br><br>However, we concur with the modification made by the Court of Appeals with respect to the penalty of life imprisonment for carnapping originally imposed by the trial court.&nbsp; Life imprisonment has long been replaced with the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death by virtue of Republic Act No. 7659.&nbsp; Furthermore, the said penalty is applicable only to the special complex crime of carnapping with homicide which is not obtaining in this case. Jurisprudence tells us that to prove the special complex crime of carnapping with homicide, there must be proof not only of the essential elements of carnapping, but also that it was the original criminal design of the culprit and the killing was perpetrated in the course of the commission of the carnapping or on the occasion thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; The appellate court correctly observed that the killing of Jesus cannot qualify the carnapping into a special complex crime because the carnapping was merely an afterthought when the victim’s death was already <i>fait accompli.</i>&nbsp; Thus, appellant is guilty only of simple carnapping.<br><br>It is enshrined in jurisprudence that when death occurs due to a crime, the following damages may be awarded: (1) civil indemnity <i>ex delicto</i> for the death of the victim; (2) actual or compensatory damages; (3) moral damages; (4) exemplary damages; and (5) temperate damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>There being no aggravating circumstance since, as discussed earlier, abuse of superior strength is absorbed in the qualifying circumstance of treachery, the award of P75,000.00 as moral damages should be decreased to P50,000.00. Such an amount is granted even in the absence of proof of mental and emotional suffering of the victim’s heirs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Pursuant to current jurisprudence, the award of civil indemnity in the amount of P75,000.00<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> and exemplary damages in the amount of P30,000.00<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> is correct.&nbsp; The amount of actual damages duly proven in court in the sum of P60,100.00 is likewise upheld.&nbsp; Finally, we impose interest at the rate of 6% per annum on all damages from the date of finality of this ruling until fully paid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>With regard to appellant’s conviction for simple carnapping, we affirm the penalty of imprisonment imposed by the Court of Appeals which is fourteen (14) years and eight (8) months, as minimum, to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months, as maximum.&nbsp; Likewise, we uphold the order upon appellant to pay the sum of P65,875.00 representing the total amount of the installment payments made on the motorcycle.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the Decision dated July 29, 2011 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
