Venadas, Sr. (Judge Venadas, Sr.) of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Malaybalay, Bukidnon, Branch 8, for Grave Abuse of Authority and Grave Misconduct.<br><br><b><i>Factual Antecedents</i></b><br><br>Spouses Reynaldo and Hilly G. Sombilon (spouses Sombilon) were the previous owners of a 601-square meter property, with two buildings constructed on it, in South Poblacion, Maramag, Bukidnon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> The said property, which they mortgaged to the Philippine National Bank (PNB) as security for their loan, was foreclosed and sold at public auction on July 15, 1998, where PNB emerged as the winning bidder in the amount of P2,355,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Consequently, on August 20, 1998, a Certificate of Sale was issued in PNB’s name, which was duly registered with the Registry of Deeds for Bukidnon on August 25, 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> The one-year redemption period lapsed but spouses Sombilon failed to redeem the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>In 2005, spouses Sombilon sought the help of Atty. Rey Ferdinand T. Garay (Atty. Garay), a Public Attorney’s Office (PAO) lawyer, who was once appointed by the court as counsel <i>de officio</i> for Hilly Sombilon in a criminal case and who happens to be the owner of a lot adjacent to the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Spouses Sombilon told Atty.

The case was docketed as Special Civil Case No. 375-05 and raffled to Branch 8, presided over by Judge Venadas, Sr.<br><br>On June 10, 2005, Judge Venadas, Sr. issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> granting the Petition and, on June 27, 2005, he issued a Writ of Possession<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> in favor of PNB.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>On June 22, 2005, PNB informed spouses Sombilon that Atty.

Garay,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> who was the former counsel of Hilly, was barred from purchasing the property pursuant to paragraph 5,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Article 1491 of the Civil Code.<br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Regional Trial Court</i></b><br><br>On July 14, 2005, Judge Venadas, Sr. issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> holding in abeyance the implementation of the Writ of Possession, a portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>Although, ordinarily a writ of possession is issued by the court because it is a mandatory and ministerial duty under Act 3135, x x x there is x x x an exception to this rule that if the implementation and enforcement of the writ of possession would work [great] injustice to the registered owner because the petitioner PNB or in this case Atty. Garay counsel for the Sombilon[s] is not entitled thereto. There is much to be said about the conduct of Atty. Garay in manipulating that the property in question was finally bought by him from the PNB not to mention the possible violation of the [canon] of legal and judicial ethics. However, the court cannot ignore the version of Mrs. Sombilon. The court will give Atty. Garay [the opportunity] to rebut the evidence presented by spouses Sombilon and he is directed to appear on August 2, 2005, at 8:30 in the morning. And if this case cannot be accommodated in the morning[,] it will proceed in the afternoon.<br><br>Send proper notice to Atty. Rey Ferdinand Garay for him to appear on said date.<br><br>In the meantime, the full implementation x x x of the Writ of Possession is hereby held in abeyance. Sheriff Claudio C.

Garay and PNB elevated the case to the CA <i>via</i> a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> with prayer for issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and/or Injunction<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.<br><br>Initially, on August 2, 2005, the CA dismissed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> for several procedural defects.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> However, on reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> the CA reinstated the Petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>On July 25, 2006, the CA issued a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> granting the PNB and Atty. Garay’s application for a TRO. Thus:<br><blockquote>Accordingly, let a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) be issued upon the posting of a Five Thousand Peso (P5,000.00) bond within five (5) days from receipt hereof ordering, [petitioners] to:<br><br>1. Cease and desist from doing any act which is destructive of, or involves danger to, or alters the nature and condition of the property;<br><br>2. Cease and desist from collecting rent or income [for the use of] the said property;<br><br>3. To deposit any rent or income arising from the said property which they may have already received to the Clerk of Court of the Regional Trial Court of the Tenth Judicial Region, Malaybalay City; and<br><br>Furthermore, all tenants are hereby ordered to deposit any rentals arising from the disputed property to the said Clerk of Court.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br></blockquote><b><i>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</i></b><br><br>On June 13, 2007, the CA rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> granting the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>. The CA found grave abuse of discretion on the part of Judge Venadas, Sr. in holding in abeyance the implementation of the Writ of Possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> The dispositive portion of the Decision reads:<br><blockquote>ACCORDINGLY, the petition for certiorari is hereby GRANTED and the assailed July 14, 2005 Order of the court a quo is hereby SET ASIDE.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br></blockquote>Spouses Sombilon moved for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> but the CA denied the same in its August 8, 2007 Resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Hence, spouses Sombilon filed the instant Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> contending that:<br><blockquote>THE [CA] COMMITTED A REVERSIBLE ERROR AND GRAVELY ERRED IN GRANTING THE PETITION FOR CERTIORARI OF [ATTY. GARAY AND PNB] AND IN DECLARING THAT THERE WAS GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNT[ING] TO LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION COMMITTED BY THE [RTC], BRANCH [8], MALAYBALAY CITY, WHICH IS CONTRARY [TO] LAW AND APPLICABLE DECISIONS OF THE HONORABLE SUPREME COURT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br></blockquote><b><i>Spouses Sombilon’s Arguments</i></b><br><br>Spouses Sombilon insist that the CA should have dismissed the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> due to the failure of PNB and Atty. Garay to file a Motion for Reconsideration of the assailed Order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> They also allege that PNB and Atty. Garay engaged in forum-shopping when they filed a Motion to Recall Order with the RTC, in addition to the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> they earlier filed with the CA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>As to the assailed Order, they contend that Judge Venadas, Sr. did not commit grave abuse of discretion in holding in abeyance the implementation of the Writ of Possession because PNB no longer has the legal personality to apply for a Writ of Possession considering that the subject property had already been sold to Atty. Garay,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> who they claim is also not entitled to the Writ of Possession as he is disqualified from purchasing the subject property pursuant to paragraph 5, Article 1491 of the Civil Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br><b><i>Atty. Garay’s and PNB’s Arguments</i></b><br><br>Atty. Garay, on the other hand, argues that the CA did not err in granting the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> as Judge Venadas, Sr. acted with grave abuse of discretion when he recalled the Writ of Possession without notice to him and PNB.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> He also emphasizes that it is a ministerial duty of the court to issue a writ of possession after the redemption period has lapsed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>PNB, for its part, asserts that as the registered owner of the subject property, it is entitled to the Writ of Possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Thus, it was grave abuse of discretion on the part of Judge Venadas, Sr. in holding in abeyance the implementation of the Writ of Possession, which he had earlier issued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>PNB further avers that it is not privy to the arrangement or relationship between Atty. Garay and spouses Sombilon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> In any case, the prohibition in paragraph 5, Article 1491 of the Civil Code does not apply to the instant case as Atty. Garay purchased the subject property from PNB and not from spouses Sombilon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>Anent its failure to file a Motion for Reconsideration prior to filing a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>, PNB explains that in this case the filing of a Motion for Reconsideration may be dispensed with as the issue involved is purely one of law, which is an exception under prevailing jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Besides, there was no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy available at the time considering that Judge Venadas, Sr. issued the assailed Order, holding in abeyance the implementation of the Writ of Possession, without affording PNB the opportunity to be heard.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>Lastly, PNB denies that it committed forum-shopping claiming that it did not institute another action simultaneously with the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> it filed with the CA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br><b><i><u>A.M. No. RTJ-06-2000</u></i></b><br><br>Meanwhile, on November 15, 2005, Atty. Garay filed a Verified Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> against Judge Venadas, Sr., charging him with Grave Abuse of Authority and Grave Misconduct when he proceeded with the hearing of spouses Sombilon’s motion for reconsideration of the Order granting the issuance of the Writ of Possession despite lack of notice to PNB and for holding in abeyance the Writ of Possession he issued in Special Civil Case No. 375-05.<br><br><b><i>Atty. Garay’s Arguments</i></b><br><br>Atty. Garay claims that Judge Venadas, Sr. should be administratively sanctioned for holding in abeyance the Writ of Possession he earlier issued<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> and for ignoring Sections 4,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> 5,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> and 6<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> of Rule 15 of the Rules of Court as he proceeded to hear the motion despite lack of notice to PNB.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br><b><i>Judge Venadas, Sr.’s Arguments</i></b><br><br>In his defense, Judge Venadas, Sr. denies the charges against him arguing that he did not annul the Writ of Possession but merely stayed its execution and implementation to prevent any injustice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> He insists there was no violation of due process because he immediately scheduled a hearing for PNB to present its evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br><b><i>Report and Recommendation of the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA)</i></b><br><br>The OCA, in its Report,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> found Judge Venadas, Sr. administratively liable for grave abuse of authority bordering on gross ignorance of procedure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> Although the OCA did not touch on the issue of whether Judge Venadas, Sr. should be administratively sanctioned for holding in abeyance the implementation of the Writ of Possession as it was still pending with the CA at that time, it nevertheless found Judge Venadas, Sr. guilty of blatantly disregarding Sections 4, 5, and 6 of Rule 15 of the Rules of Court when he acted on the defective motion filed by spouses Sombilon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> It also pointed out that PNB and Atty. Garay were deprived of their rights to due process as no proper notice was sent to them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> Thus, the OCA recommended that:<br><blockquote>a) the instant administrative complaint be DOCKETED as a regular administrative complaint;<br><br>b) respondent Judge Rolando S. Venadas, Sr. be found guilty of gross ignorance of procedure; and<br><br>c) respondent Judge Rolando S. Venadas, Sr. be ordered to pay a FINE of TWENTY THOUSAND PESOS (P20,000.00) with a WARNING that a similar transgression x x x will be dealt with more severely.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br></blockquote>On November 26, 2007, the Court resolved to consolidate A.M. No. RTJ-06-2000 with G.R. No. 179914.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><div style="text-align: left;"><center><b><br>Issues</b><br></center></div><br>Stripped of the non-essentials, the issues boil down to: (1) whether Judge Venadas, Sr. committed grave abuse of discretion in holding in abeyance the implementation of the Writ of Possession; and (2) whether he should be administratively sanctioned for holding in abeyance the implementation of the Writ of Possession and for disregarding Sections 4, 5, and 6, Rule 15 of the Rules of Court.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br><b><i><u>G.R. No. 179914</u></i></b><br><br><b><i>The issuance of a writ of possession is ministerial upon the court. </i></b><br><br>A debtor has one year from the date the Certificate of Sale is registered with the Register of Deeds within which to redeem his property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> During the one-year redemption period, the purchaser may possess the property by filing a petition for the issuance of a writ of possession before the court, upon the posting of a bond.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> But after the one-year period, the purchaser has a right to consolidate the title and to possess the property, without need of a bond.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> And once title is consolidated under the name of the purchaser, the issuance of the writ of possession becomes ministerial on the part of the court; thus, no discretion is left to the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> Questions regarding the regularity and validity of the mortgage or the foreclosure sale may not be raised as a ground to oppose or hold in abeyance the issuance of the writ of possession as these must be raised in a separate action for the annulment of the mortgage or the foreclosure sale.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> The pendency of such action is also not a ground to stay the issuance of a writ of possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>In this case, the redemption period had long lapsed when PNB applied for the issuance of the Writ of Possession. In fact, the title over the subject property had already been consolidated in PNB’s name. Thus, it was ministerial upon Judge Venadas, Sr. to issue the Writ of Possession in favor of PNB, the registered owner of the subject property.<br><br>Though there are instances when the issuance of the Writ of Possession may be deferred,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> we find none of these recognized exceptions present in the instant case. Spouses Sombilon claim that the sale between PNB and Atty. Garay was invalid as it was done in violation of paragraph 5, Article 1491 of the Civil Code. However, the alleged invalidity of the sale is not a ground to oppose or defer the issuance of the Writ of Possession as this does not affect PNB’s right to possess the subject property. Thus, there was no reason for Judge Venadas, Sr. to hold in abeyance the implementation of the Writ of Possession. Clearly, he committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing the assailed Order holding in abeyance the implementation of the Writ of Possession because PNB, as the registered owner, is entitled to the possession of the subject property as a matter of right.<br><br>Regarding the failure of PNB and Atty. Garay to move for a reconsideration of the assailed Order prior to the availment of a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i>, we agree with PNB that the filing of a motion for reconsideration may be dispensed with where the decision is a patent nullity or where there is violation of due process,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> such as in the instant case.<br><br>All told, we find no error on the part of the CA in granting the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>.<br><br><b><i><u>A.M. No. RTJ-06-2000</u></i></b><br><br>As to the Administrative Complaint filed against Judge Venadas, Sr., we agree with the findings and recommendations of the OCA.<br><br>Records show that spouses Sombilon failed to comply with the three-day notice rule and the required proof of service embodied in Sections 4, 5, and 6 of Rule 15 of the Rules of Court, thereby rendering the motion fatally defective. Despite this, Judge Venadas, Sr. still took cognizance of the motion filed by spouses Sombilon, depriving PNB and Atty. Garay of their right to due process.<br><br>To exculpate himself from the charges against him, Judge Venadas, Sr. claims that the motion was personally served on PNB and its counsel on July 12, 2005 but they refused to receive the same. However, as aptly pointed out by the OCA, no affidavit was submitted to substantiate such allegation. Thus, we agree with the Court Administrator that Judge Venadas, Sr. is guilty of grave abuse of authority bordering on gross ignorance of procedure for blatantly disregarding Sections 4, 5, and 6, Rule 15 of the Rules of Court.<br><br>Blatant disregard of basic, elementary, and well-known rules of procedure and law is gross ignorance of the law,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> which is classified as a serious charge under Rule 140, Section 8 of the Rules of Court, as amended by A.M. No. 01-8-10-SC, punishable by either dismissal from service, suspension for more than three months but not exceeding six months, or a fine of more than P20,000.00 but not exceeding P40,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>Thus, in view of his blatant disregard of the rules and his grave abuse of discretion in issuing the assailed Order, and considering that this is his first offense, we find Judge Venadas, Sr. guilty of grave abuse of authority bordering on gross ignorance of the law and is hereby fined the amount of P20,000.00. Incidentally, in the April 18, 2007 Resolution in A.M. No. 12600-Ret.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> the Court approved the application of Judge Venadas, Sr. for disability retirement but withheld the amount of P100,000.00 pending the final resolution of this case. In view thereof, the fine of P20,000.00 herein imposed on Judge Venadas, Sr. is to be deducted from the withheld amount of P100,000.00.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in G.R.
