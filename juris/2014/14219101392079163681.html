Benefits and Services <b>for OWWA Members</b>. For a US$25.00 membership contribution, an OWWA member shall be entitled to the following benefits and services: x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br></blockquote>According to petitioners, respondents acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in issuing the Omnibus Policies, the provisions of which are contrary to the Constitution and its enabling laws. Petitioners alleged that the OWWA was created by law to provide welfare services to all Filipino overseas contract workers, without limiting the same to member-contributors only. However, because of the passage of the Omnibus Policies, the OWWA benefits shall be available only to those overseas contract workers who have paid their monetary contribution on a per contract basis.&nbsp; It imposed on the overseas workers the compulsory payment of OWWA membership contribution in the amount of US$25.00, which was originally collected from their employers. This, petitioners contend, is violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution for it created a distinction between Filipino overseas workers who contributed to the OWWA Fund and those who have not. Moreover, petitioners likewise assailed as invalid the provisions which allow the OWWA Board members to designate their proxies to vote in their stead in the Board meetings as well as those which classify the minutes, transcripts, and other documents of the OWWA as confidential and cannot be publicly circulated without authorization from the Board.<br><br>Respondents countered that the assailed Omnibus Policies do not violate the equal protection clause for the same is germane to the purpose of the law, which requires registration and documentation of overseas workers for their protections from exploitation in foreign countries. Moreover, the prescribed membership fees chargeable to the employers had long been implemented pursuant to Letter of Instructions (LOI) No. 537 signed by then President Ferdinand E. Marcos on May 1, 1977, which was formalized by the issuance of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1694 on May 1, 1980, as amended by PD No. 1809 issued on January 16, 1981, creating the Welfare Fund for Overseas Workers (hereinafter referred to as the “Welfund”). According to respondents, these issuances expressly instructed the collection of fees for the promotion of Filipino overseas workers’ interests. Hence, there was no undue implementation of the law. Furthermore, the Omnibus Policies do not violate petitioners’ right to free access to information as the approved minutes and official resolutions of the OWWA were made available upon legitimate request by the public, pursuant to OWWA Resolution No. 006, Series of 2004.<br><br>On August 31, 2004, the RTC promulgated its Order dismissing the complaint for lack of jurisdiction. According to the lower court, the determination of constitutionality of the assailed resolution rests, not within its jurisdiction, but within the jurisdiction of this Court. As such, it ruled that the appropriate remedy to annul and set aside the subject issuance was a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court. Thus, for reasons of law, comity and convenience, the lower court held that it could not arrogate unto itself the authority to resolve the constitutionality of the administrative act.<br><br>On February 18, 2005, petitioners filed the instant petition essentially invoking the following argument:<br><blockquote><center>I.<br></center><br>THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR OF LAW IN DISMISSING CIVIL CASE NO. 04-0077 ON THE GROUND OF LACK OF JURISDICTION FOR REGIONAL TRIAL COURTS HAVE ORIGINAL JURISDICTION TO HEAR AND DECIDE CASES INVOLVING THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OR VALIDITY OF ADMINISTRATIVE RULES AND REGULATIONS.<br></blockquote>Petitioners fault the RTC for abruptly dismissing their complaint for lack of jurisdiction when it is well established in law and jurisprudence that Regional Trial Courts have jurisdiction over cases involving the constitutionality or legality of administrative rules and regulations, such as the Omnibus Policies promulgated by respondents herein. The reliance on our ruling in <i>Fortich v. Corona</i>, petitioners posit, is misplaced for the same involves a resolution issued by the Office of the President in the exercise of its <i>quasi-judicial</i> functions. Hence, the special civil action for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court is not the appropriate remedy in the instant case.<br><br>In their Comment, respondents counter that petitioners, in filing the instant action with this Court, committed serious procedural error for violating the doctrine of judicial hierarchy of courts. According to respondents, petitioners should have first filed an appeal before the Court of Appeals (CA), pursuant to Section 2(a), Rule 41 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Respondents further reiterated the validity of the subject Omnibus Policies.<br><br>We rule in favor of petitioners.<br><br>Section 2(c), Rule 41 of the Rules of Court provides that the mode of appeal in all cases involving only questions of law shall be by petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> to the Supreme Court in accordance with Rule 45.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Time and again, this Court has distinguished cases involving pure questions of law from those of pure questions of fact in the following manner:<br><blockquote>A question of fact exists when a doubt or difference arises as to the truth or falsity of alleged facts. If the query requires a re-evaluation of the credibility of witnesses or the existence or relevance of surrounding circumstances and their relation to each other, the issue in that query is factual. On the other hand, there is a question of law when the doubt or difference arises as to what the law is on certain state of facts and which does not call for an existence of the probative value of the evidence presented by the parties-litigants. In a case involving a question of law, the resolution of the issue rests solely on what the law provides on the given set of circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br></blockquote>In the present petition, the appeal interposed by petitioners stems from the Orders of the RTC dismissing their complaint for lack of jurisdiction. The issue raised herein is one of jurisdiction over the subject matter, specifically, whether or not the RTC has jurisdiction over petitioners’ complaint challenging the constitutionality of the Omnibus Policies issued by respondents.<br><br>Jurisdiction is the right to act or the power and authority to hear and determine a case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> It is conferred only by the Constitution or by statute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The question as to whether or not the dismissal by the lower court for lack of jurisdiction is proper involves the determination of whether, admitting the facts alleged in the complaint to be true, the trial court has jurisdiction over the same in light of the laws governing jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> As such, jurisdiction is neither a question of fact or of fact and law but a matter of law. For this reason, We have consistently held that a court’s jurisdiction over the subject matter of a case is a question of law,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> and have, in fact, affirmed dismissals by the CA of appeals brought to them involving pure questions of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Considering that only questions of law was raised in this petition, direct resort to this Court is proper.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>We cannot, therefore, give credence to the lower court’s contention that the appropriate remedy to annul and set aside the issuance subject of this case is a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court. <i>Certiorari</i>, as a special civil action, is available only if: (1) it is directed against a tribunal, board, or officer exercising <i>judicial or quasi-judicial functions</i>; (2) the tribunal, board, or officer acted without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction; and (3) there is no appeal nor any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>In this case, respondents did not act in any judicial or quasi-judicial capacity in issuing the assailed resolution. They were not called upon to adjudicate the rights of contending parties to exercise, in any manner, discretion of a judicial nature. Instead, their issuance of the challenged resolution was done in the exercise of their quasi-legislative and administrative functions within the confines of the granting law.&nbsp; Hence, contrary to the lower court’s contention, <i>certiorari</i> is not the proper remedy in the instant case.<br><br>As to whether the RTC has jurisdiction over the subject matter involved in this case, it is settled in law and jurisprudence that the RTC has jurisdiction to resolve the constitutionality of a statute, presidential decree, executive order, or administrative regulation, as recognized in Section 2(a), Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution, which provides:<br><blockquote>SECTION 5. The Supreme Court shall have the following powers:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(2) <b>Review, revise, reverse, modify, or affirm on appeal or certiorari</b>, as the law or the Rules of Court may provide <b>final judgments and orders of lower courts</b> in:<br><blockquote>(a) All cases in which the <b>constitutionality or validity</b> of any treaty, international or executive agreement, law, presidential decree, proclamation, order, instruction, <b>ordinance, or regulation</b> is in question.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></blockquote></blockquote>In view of the foregoing provision, the jurisdiction of regular courts involving the validity or constitutionality of a rule or regulation cannot be denied. We have had several occasions wherein We affirmed the power of the RTC to take cognizance of actions assailing a specific rule or set of rules promulgated by administrative bodies for the power of judicial review is vested by the Constitution not only in this Court but in all Regional Trial Courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; It was, therefore, erroneous for the RTC to abruptly dismiss the complaint filed by petitioners on the basis of lack of jurisdiction since said court clearly had the power to take cognizance of the same. In so doing, the lower court failed to ascertain factual issues necessary to determine whether the subject issuance is, indeed, invalid and violative of the Constitution. Considering the settled rule that this Court is not a trier of facts,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> a remand of this case to the RTC for the proper determination of the merits of the complaint is just and proper.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the instant petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.&nbsp; The Orders of the Regional Trial Court, dated August 31, 2004 and January 14, 2005, in Civil Case No. 04-0077, are <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b>.
