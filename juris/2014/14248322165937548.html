				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">It is the burden of the employer to prove that a person whose services it pays for is an independent contractor rather than a regular employee with or without a fixed term.

These sections state:<br><br><blockquote><b>SEC. 4. <i>Verification</i></b>. — Except when otherwise specifically required by law or rule, pleadings need not be under oath, verified or accompanied by affidavit.<br><br>A pleading is verified by an affidavit that the affiant has read the pleading and that the allegations therein are true and correct of his knowledge and belief.<br><br>A pleading required to be verified which contains a verification based on “information and belief,” or upon “knowledge, information and belief,” or lacks a proper verification, shall be treated as an unsigned pleading.<br><br><b>SEC. 5. <i>Certification against forum shopping.</i>—</b> The plaintiff or principal party shall certify under oath in the complaint or other initiatory pleading asserting a claim for relief or in a sworn certification annexed thereto and simultaneously filed therewith: (a) that he has not theretofore commenced any action or filed any claim involving the same issues in any court, tribunal or quasi-judicial agency and, to the best of his knowledge, no such other action or claim is pending therein; (b) if there is such other pending action or claim, a complete statement of the present status thereof; and (c) if he should thereafter learn that the same or similar action or claim has been filed or is pending, he shall report that fact within five (5) days therefrom to the court wherein his aforesaid complaint or initiatory pleading has been filed.<br><br>Failure to comply with the foregoing requirements shall not be curable by mere amendment of the complaint or other initiatory pleading but shall be cause for the dismissal of the case without prejudice, unless otherwise provided, upon motion and after hearing. The submission of a false certification or non-compliance with any of the undertakings therein shall constitute indirect contempt of court, without prejudice to the corresponding administrative and criminal actions. If the acts of the party or his counsel clearly constitute willful and deliberate forum shopping, the same shall be ground for summary dismissal with prejudice and shall constitute direct contempt, as well as a cause for administrative sanctions.</blockquote><br>Section 4(e) of Rule 45<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> requires that petitions for review should “contain a sworn certification against forum shopping as provided in the last paragraph of section 2, Rule 42.” Section 5 of the same rule provides that failure to comply with any requirement in Section 4 is sufficient ground to dismiss the petition.<br><br><b>Effects of non-compliance</b><br><br><i>Uy v.

Verification is simply intended to secure an assurance that the allegations in the pleading are true and correct and not the product of the imagination or a matter of speculation, and that the pleading is filed in good faith. The court may order the correction of the pleading if the verification is lacking or act on the pleading although it is not verified, if the attending circumstances are such that strict compliance with the rules may be dispensed with in order that the ends of justice may thereby be served.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br><i>Shipside Incorporated v.

Section 5, Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure provides that the failure of the petitioner to submit the required documents that should accompany the petition, including the certification against forum shopping, shall be sufficient ground for the dismissal thereof. <i>The same rule applies to certifications against forum shopping signed by a person on behalf of a corporation which are unaccompanied by proof that said signatory is authorized to file a petition on behalf of the corporation.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><b>Effects of substantial compliance<br>with the requirement of verification<br>and certification against forum shopping</b><br><br>Although the general rule is that failure to attach a verification and certification against forum shopping is a ground for dismissal, there are cases where this court allowed substantial compliance.<br><br>In <i>Loyola v.

We shall scrutinize whether the nature of Arlene’s work was necessary and desirable to Fuji’s business or whether Fuji only needed the output of her work.

The reason for this is evident: when a prospective employee, on account of special skills or market forces, is in a position to make demands upon the prospective employer, such prospective employee needs less protection than the ordinary worker.

Article XIII, Section 3 of the 1987 Constitution provides full protection to labor:<br><br><blockquote><b><center>Article XIII.

The State shall afford full protection to labor, local and overseas, organized and unorganized, and promote full employment and equality of employment opportunities for all.<br><br>It shall guarantee the rights of all workers to self-organization, collective bargaining and negotiations, and peaceful concerted activities, including the right to strike in accordance with law. They shall be entitled to security of tenure, humane conditions of work, and a living wage. They shall also participate in policy and decision-making processes affecting their rights and benefits as may be provided by law.<br><br>The State shall promote the principle of shared responsibility between workers and employers and the preferential use of voluntary modes in settling disputes, including conciliation, and shall enforce their mutual compliance therewith to foster industrial peace.<br><br>The State shall regulate the relations between workers and employers, recognizing the right of labor to its just share in the fruits of production and the right of enterprises to reasonable returns on investments, and to expansion and growth.</blockquote><br>Apart from the constitutional guarantee of protection to labor, Article 1700 of the Civil Code states:<br><br><blockquote>ART. 1700. The relations between capital and labor are not merely contractual. They are so impressed with public interest that labor contracts must yield to the common good. Therefore, such contracts are subject to the special laws on labor unions, collective bargaining, strikes and lockouts, closed shop, wages, working conditions, hours of labor and similar subjects.</blockquote><br>In contracts of employment, the employer and the employee are not on equal footing. Thus, it is subject to regulatory review by the labor tribunals and courts of law. The law serves to equalize the unequal. The labor force is a special class that is constitutionally protected because of the inequality between capital and labor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[176]</sup> This presupposes that the labor force is weak.<br><br>However, the level of protection to labor should vary from case to case; otherwise, the state might appear to be too paternalistic in affording protection to labor. As stated in <i>GMA Network, Inc. v. Pabriga,</i> the ruling in Brent applies in cases where it appears that the employer and employee are on equal footing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[177]</sup> This recognizes the fact that not all workers are weak. To reiterate the discussion in <i>GMA Network v. Pabriga</i>:<br><br><blockquote>The reason for this is evident: when a prospective employee, on account of special skills or market forces, is in a position to make demands upon the prospective employer, such prospective employee needs less protection than the ordinary worker. Lesser limitations on the parties’ freedom of contract are thus required for the protection of the employee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[178]</sup></blockquote><br>The level of protection to labor must be determined on the basis of the nature of the work, qualifications of the employee, and other relevant circumstances.<br><br>For example, a prospective employee with a bachelor’s degree cannot be said to be on equal footing with a grocery bagger with a high school diploma. Employees who qualify for jobs requiring special qualifications such as “[having] a Master’s degree” or “[having] passed the licensure exam” are different from employees who qualify for jobs that require “[being a] high school graduate; with pleasing personality.” In these situations, it is clear that those with special qualifications can bargain with the employer on equal footing. Thus, the level of protection afforded to these employees should be different.<br><br>Fuji’s argument that Arlene was an independent contractor under a fixed-term contract is contradictory. Employees under fixed-term contracts cannot be independent contractors because in fixed-term contracts, an employer-employee relationship exists. The test in this kind of contract is not the necessity and desirability of the employee’s activities, “but the day certain agreed upon by the parties for the commencement and termination of the employment relationship.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[179]</sup> For regular employees, the necessity and desirability of their work in the usual course of the employer’s business are the determining factors.

The elements of the four-fold test are the following: (1) the selection and engagement of the employee; (2) the payment of wages; (3) the power of dismissal; and (4) the power of control, which is the most important element.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[181]</sup><br><br>The “power of control” was explained by this court in <i>Corporal, Sr. v.

Was the nature of Arlene’s work necessary and desirable for Fuji’s usual course of business?<br><br><b>Arlene was a regular employee<br>with a fixed-term contract</b><br><br>The test for determining regular employment is whether there is a reasonable connection between the employee’s activities and the usual business of the employer. Article 280 provides that the nature of work must be “necessary or desirable in the usual business or trade of the employer” as the test for determining regular employment. As stated in <i>ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation v. Nazareno</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[204]</sup><br><br><blockquote>In determining whether an employment should be considered regular or non-regular, the applicable test is the reasonable connection between the particular activity performed by the employee in relation to the usual business or trade of the employer. The standard, supplied by the law itself, is whether the work undertaken is necessary or desirable in the usual business or trade of the employer, a fact that can be assessed by looking into the nature of the services rendered and its relation to the general scheme under which the business or trade is pursued in the usual course. It is distinguished from a specific undertaking that is divorced from the normal activities required in carrying on the particular business or trade.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[205]</sup></blockquote><br>However, there may be a situation where an employee’s work is necessary but is not always desirable in the usual course of business of the employer. In this situation, there is no regular employment.<br><br>In <i>San Miguel Corporation v. National Labor Relations Commission</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[206]</sup> Francisco de Guzman was hired to repair furnaces at San Miguel Corporation’s Manila glass plant.

The process of manufacturing glass requires a furnace, which has a limited operating life. Petitioner resorted to hiring project or fixed term employees in having said furnaces repaired since said activity is not regularly performed. Said furnaces are to be repaired or overhauled only in case of need and after being used continuously for a varying period of five (5) to ten (10) years.<br><br>In 1990, one of the furnaces of petitioner required repair and upgrading. This was an undertaking distinct and separate from petitioner's business of manufacturing glass. For this purpose, petitioner must hire workers to undertake the said repair and upgrading. . . .<br><br>. . . .<br><br>Clearly, private respondent was hired for a specific project that was not within the regular business of the corporation. For petitioner is not engaged in the business of repairing furnaces. Although the activity was necessary to enable petitioner to continue manufacturing glass, the necessity therefor arose only when a particular furnace reached the end of its life or operating cycle. Or, as in the second undertaking, when a particular furnace required an emergency repair. In other words, the undertakings where private respondent was hired primarily as helper/bricklayer have specified goals and purposes which are fulfilled once the designated work was completed. Moreover, such undertakings were also identifiably separate and distinct from the usual, ordinary or regular business operations of petitioner, which is glass manufacturing. These undertakings, the duration and scope of which had been determined and made known to private respondent at the time of his employment, clearly indicated the nature of his employment as a project employee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[208]</sup></blockquote><br>Fuji is engaged in the business of broadcasting,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[209]</sup> including news programming.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[210]</sup> It is based in Japan<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[211]</sup> and has overseas offices to cover international news.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[212]</sup><br><br>Based on the record, Fuji’s Manila Bureau Office is a small unit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[213]</sup> and has a few employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[214]</sup> As such, Arlene had to do all activities related to news gathering.

What Fuji did was to inform her that her contract would no longer be renewed, and when she did not agree, her salary was withheld.

Backwages were also awarded, to be computed from date of dismissal until the finality of the National Labor Relations Commission’s decision. However, only backwages were included in the dispositive portion because the National Labor Relations Commission recognized that Arlene had received separation pay in the amount of US$7,600.00.<br><br>The Court of Appeals affirmed the National Labor Relations Commission’s decision but modified it by awarding moral and exemplary damages and attorney’s fees, and all other benefits Arlene was entitled to under her contract with Fuji. The Court of Appeals also ordered reinstatement, reasoning that the grounds when separation pay was awarded in lieu of reinstatement were not proven.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[241]</sup><br><br>Article 279 of the Labor Code provides:<br><br><blockquote><b>Art. 279. Security of tenure.</b> In cases of regular employment, the employer shall not terminate the services of an employee except for a just cause or when authorized by this Title. <i>An employee who is unjustly dismissed from work shall be entitled to reinstatement without loss of seniority rights and other privileges and to his full backwages, inclusive of allowances, and to his other benefits or their monetary equivalent computed from the time his compensation was withheld from him up to the time of his actual reinstatement.</i> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The Court of Appeals’ modification of the National Labor Relations Commission’s decision was proper because the law itself provides that illegally dismissed employees are entitled to reinstatement, backwages including allowances, and all other benefits.<br><br>On reinstatement, the National Labor Relations Commission ordered payment of separation pay in lieu of reinstatement, reasoning “that the filing of the instant suit may have seriously abraded the relationship of the parties so as to render reinstatement impractical.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[242]</sup> The Court of Appeals reversed this and ordered reinstatement on the ground that separation pay in lieu of reinstatement is allowed only in several instances such as (1) when the employer has ceased operations; (2) when the employee’s position is no longer available; (3) strained relations; and (4) a substantial period has lapsed from date of filing to date of finality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[243]</sup><br><br>On this matter, <i>Quijano v. Mercury Drug Corp</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[244]</sup> is instructive:<br><br><blockquote>Well-entrenched is the rule that an illegally dismissed employee is entitled to reinstatement as a matter of right. . . .<br><br>To protect labor’s security of tenure, we emphasize that the doctrine of “strained relations” should be strictly applied so as not to deprive an illegally dismissed employee of his right to reinstatement. Every labor dispute almost always results in “strained relations” and the phrase cannot be given an overarching interpretation, otherwise, an unjustly dismissed employee can never be reinstated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[245]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote><br>The Court of Appeals reasoned that strained relations are a question of fact that must be supported by evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[246]</sup> No evidence was presented by Fuji to prove that reinstatement was no longer feasible. Fuji did not allege that it ceased operations or that Arlene’s position was no longer available. Nothing in the records shows that Arlene’s reinstatement would cause an atmosphere of antagonism in the workplace. Arlene filed her complaint in 2009. Five (5) years are not yet a substantial period<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[247]</sup> to bar reinstatement.<br><br>On the award of damages, Fuji argues that Arlene is not entitled to the award of damages and attorney’s fees because the non-renewal agreement contained a quitclaim, which Arlene signed.<br><br>Quitclaims in labor cases do not bar illegally dismissed employees from filing labor complaints and money claim. As explained by Arlene, she signed the non-renewal agreement out of necessity. In <i>Land and Housing Development Corporation v. Esquillo,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[248]</sup> this court explained:<br><br><blockquote>We have heretofore explained that the reason why quitclaims are commonly frowned upon as contrary to public policy, and why they are held to be ineffective to bar claims for the full measure of the workers’ legal rights, is the fact that the employer and the employee obviously do not stand on the same footing. The employer drove the employee to the wall. The latter must have to get hold of money. Because, out of a job, he had to face the harsh necessities of life. He thus found himself in no position to resist money proffered. His, then, is a case of adherence, not of choice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[249]</sup></blockquote><br>With regard to the Court of Appeals’ award of moral and exemplary damages and attorney’s fees, this court has recognized in several cases that moral damages are awarded “when the dismissal is attended by bad faith or fraud or constitutes an act oppressive to labor, or is done in a manner contrary to good morals, good customs or public policy.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[250]</sup> On the other hand, exemplary damages may be awarded when the dismissal was effected “in a wanton, oppressive or malevolent manner.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[251]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals and National Labor Relations Commission found that after Arlene had informed Fuji of her cancer, she was informed that there would be problems in renewing her contract on account of her condition. This information caused Arlene mental anguish, serious anxiety, and wounded feelings that can be gleaned from the tenor of her email dated March 11, 2009. A portion of her email reads:<br><br><blockquote>I WAS SO SURPRISED . . . that at a time when I am at my lowest, being sick and very weak, you suddenly came to deliver to me the NEWS that you will no longer renew my contract. I knew this will come but I never thought that you will be so ‘heartless’ and insensitive to deliver that news just a month after I informed you that I am sick. I was asking for patience and understanding and your response was not to RENEW my contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[252]</sup></blockquote><br>Apart from Arlene’s illegal dismissal, the manner of her dismissal was effected in an oppressive approach with her salary and other benefits being withheld until May 5, 2009, when she had no other choice but to sign the non-renewal contract. Thus, there was legal basis for the Court of Appeals to modify the National Labor Relations Commission’s decision.<br><br>However, Arlene received her salary for May 2009.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[253]</sup> Considering that the date of her illegal dismissal was May 5, 2009,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[254]</sup> this amount may be subtracted from the total monetary award.<br><br>With regard to the award of attorney’s fees, Article 111 of the Labor Code states that “[i]n cases of unlawful withholding of wages, the culpable party may be assessed attorney’s fees equivalent to ten percent of the amount of wages recovered.” Likewise, this court has recognized that “in actions for recovery of wages or where an employee was forced to litigate and, thus, incur expenses to protect his rights and interest, the award of attorney’s fees is legally and morally justifiable.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[255]</sup> Due to her illegal dismissal, Arlene was forced to litigate.<br><br>In the dispositive portion of its decision, the Court of Appeals awarded legal interest at the rate of 12% per annum.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[256]</sup> In view of this court’s ruling in <i>Nacar v.

No. 189871, August 13, 2013, 703 SCRA 439, 457–458 [Per J. Peralta, En Banc].<br>In <i>Nacar, </i>this court held:<br><br>To recapitulate and for future guidance, the guidelines laid down in the case of <i>Eastern Shipping Lines</i> are accordingly modified to embody BSP-MB Circular No. 799, as follows:<br><br>I. When an obligation, regardless of its source,<i> i.e.,</i> law, contracts, quasi-contracts, delicts or quasi-delicts is breached, the contravenor can be held liable for damages. The provisions under Title XVIII on “Damages” of the Civil Code govern in determining the measure of recoverable damages.<br>II. With regard particularly to an award of interest in the concept of actual and compensatory damages, the rate of interest, as well as the accrual thereof, is imposed, as follows:<br><br><ol><li> When the obligation is breached, and it consists in the payment of a sum of money, <i>i.e.,</i> a loan or forbearance of money, the interest due should be that which may have been stipulated in writing. Furthermore, the interest due shall itself earn legal interest from the time it is judicially demanded. In the absence of stipulation, the rate of interest shall be 6% <i>per annum</i> to be computed from default, <i>i.e.</i>, from judicial or extrajudicial demand under and subject to the provisions of Article 1169 of the Civil Code.<br><br></li><li>When an obligation, not constituting a loan or forbearance of money, is breached, an interest on the amount of damages awarded may be imposed at the discretion of the court at the rate of 6% per annum. No interest, however, shall be adjudged on unliquidated claims or damages, except when or until the demand can be established with reasonable certainty. Accordingly, where the demand is established with reasonable certainty, the interest shall begin to run from the time the claim is made judicially or extrajudicially (Art. 1169, Civil Code), but when such certainty cannot be so reasonably established at the time the demand is made, the interest shall begin to run only from the date the judgment of the court is made (at which time the quantification of damages may be deemed to have been reasonably ascertained). The actual base for the computation of legal interest shall, in any case, be on the amount finally adjudged.<br><br></li><li>When the judgment of the court awarding a sum of money becomes final and executory, the rate of legal interest, whether the case falls under paragraph 1 or paragraph 2, above, shall be 6% <i>per annum</i> from such finality until its satisfaction, this interim period being deemed to be by then an equivalent to a forbearance of credit.</li></ol>And, in addition to the above, judgments that have become final and executory prior to July 1, 2013, shall not be disturbed and shall continue to be implemented applying the rate of interest fixed therein.</http:></http:></http:></http:></http:></div>
