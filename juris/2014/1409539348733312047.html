That there must be zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales;<br>2. That input taxes were incurred or paid;<br>3.

In Intel Technology v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> we ruled that once the taxpayer has established by sufficient evidence that it is entitled to a refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate, in accordance with the requirements of Section 112(A) of the NIRC, its claim should be granted.<br><br>In <i>Atlas Consolidated Mining v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> we held that applications for refund or credit of input tax with the BIR must comply with the appropriate revenue regulations. Thus, applications must be in accordance with Section 2 of Revenue Regulations No. 3-88 (RR 3-88), amending Section 16 of Revenue Regulations No. 5-87, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 2. Section 16 of Revenue Regulations 5-87 is hereby amended to read as follows:<br><br>SECTION 16. Refunds or tax credits of input tax. –<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(c)&nbsp; Claims for tax credits/refunds. – Application for Tax Credit/Refund of Value-Added Tax Paid (BIR Form No. 2552) shall be filed with the Revenue District Office of the city or municipality where the principal place of business of the applicant is located or directly with the Commissioner, Attention: VAT Division.<br><br>A photocopy of the purchase invoice or receipt evidencing the value added tax paid shall be submitted together with the application. The original copy of the said invoice/receipt, however, shall be presented for cancellation prior to the issuance of the Tax Credit Certificate or refund. In addition, the following documents shall be attached whenever applicable:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>3. Effectively zero-rated sale of goods and services.<br><br>i) photocopy of approved application for zero-rate if filing for the first time.<br><br>ii) sales invoice or receipt showing name of the person or entity to whom the sale of goods or services were delivered, date of delivery, amount of consideration, and description of goods or services delivered. iii) evidence of actual receipt of goods or services.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>5. In applicable cases, where the applicant’s zero-rated transactions are regulated by certain government agencies, a statement therefrom showing the amount and description of sale of goods and services, name of persons or entities (except in case of exports) to whom the goods or services were sold, and date of transaction shall also be submitted.<br><br>In all cases, the amount of refund or tax credit that may be granted shall be limited to the amount of the value-added tax (VAT) paid directly and entirely attributable to the zero-rated transaction during the period covered by the application for credit or refund.<br><br>Where the applicant is engaged in zero-rated and other taxable and exempt sales of goods and services, and the VAT paid (inputs) on purchases of goods and services cannot be directly attributed to any of the aforementioned transactions, the following formula shall be used to determine the creditable or refundable input tax for zero-rated sale:<br><br><center><u>Amount of Zero-rated Sale</u><br>Total Sales<br>X<br>Total Amount of Input Taxes<br>=<br>Amount Creditable/Refundable <br>x x x x</center></blockquote><br>We likewise applied RR 3-88 in <i>AT&amp;T Communications Services Philippines, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> and held that only preponderance of evidence as applied in ordinary civil cases is needed to substantiate a claim for tax refund.<br><br>In the present case, the CTA Special First Division found that TSC complied with the requirements of Section 112(A) of the NIRC and granted its claim for refund or credit of P78,009,891.56 input VAT. Upon a partial new trial, the CTA Special First Division increased the amount to P96,846,234.31. Upon appeal, the CTA EB concluded that TSC submitted the relevant documents to substantiate its claim for refund or credit of input tax, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>1. BIR Certificate of Registration (Annex “A”, Petition for Review, CTA Case No. 7470, vol. 1, p. 13);<br><br>2. Quarterly VAT returns for the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2004 (Exhibits “D”, “E”, “F”, “G”, &amp; “H”);<br><br>3. Summary of Input Tax Payments for the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2004 showing details of purchases of goods and service as well as the corresponding input tax paid (Exhibits “D” to “D-<br><br>3”, “E” to “E-5-b”, “F” to “F-4-b”, “H-3” to “H-4-c”);<br><br>4. VAT official receipts and invoices for the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2004 (Exhibits “QQ”-7” to “QQ-21-d”, “RR-17”, “SS-1” to “SS-19” &amp; “TT-1” to TT-18”);<br><br>5. Approved Certificate for Zero-Rate (Exhibit “A”); and<br><br>6. Application for Tax Credit/Refund (BIR Form 1914) (Exhibit “B-3”)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></blockquote><br>We adopt the above-mentioned findings of fact of the CTA Special First Division, as affirmed by the CTA EB. Whether TSC complied with the substantiation requirements of Section 112 of the NIRC and RR 3-88 is a question of fact,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> which could only be answered after reviewing, examining, evaluating, or weighing all over again the probative value of the evidence before the CTA, which this Court does not have reason to do in the present petition for review on certiorari. The findings of fact of the CTA are not to be disturbed unless clearly shown to be unsupported by substantial evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Since by the very nature of its functions, the CTA has developed an expertise on this subject, the Court will not set aside lightly the conclusions reached by them, unless there has been an abuse or improvident exercise of authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>The CIR, however, insists that TSC failed to submit the complete documents enumerated in RMO 53-98. Thus, the 120-day period given for it to decide allegedly did not commence.<br><br>The CIR’s reliance on RMO 53-98 is misplaced. There is nothing in Section 112 of the NIRC, RR 3-88 or RMO 53-98 itself that requires submission of the complete documents enumerated in RMO 53-98 for a grant of a refund or credit of input VAT. The subject of RMO 53-98 states that it is a “Checklist of Documents to be Submitted by a Taxpayer upon <b>Audit </b>of his Tax Liabilities x x x.” In this case, TSC was applying for a grant of refund or credit of its input tax. There was no allegation of an audit being conducted by the CIR. Even assuming that RMO 53-98 applies, it specifically states that some documents are required to be submitted by the taxpayer “if applicable.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Moreover, if TSC indeed failed to submit the complete documents in support of its application, the CIR could have informed TSC of its failure, consistent with Revenue Memorandum Circular No. (RMC) 42-03.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; However, the CIR did not inform TSC of the document it failed to submit, even up to the present petition. The CIR likewise raised the issue of TSC’s alleged failure to submit the complete documents only in its motion for reconsideration of the CTA Special First Division’s 4 March 2010 Decision.&nbsp; Accordingly, we affirm the CTA EB’s finding that TSC filed its administrative claim on 21 December 2005, and submitted the complete documents in support of its application for refund or credit of its input tax <b>at the same time.</b><br><br>Under Section 112(C) of the NIRC, in case of failure on the part of the CIR to act on the application, the taxpayer affected may, within 30 days after the expiration of the 120-day period, appeal the unacted claim with the CTA. The charter of the CTA<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[24]</sup></font> also expressly provides that if the Commissioner fails to decide within "a specific period" required by law, such "inaction shall be deemed a denial" of the application for tax refund or credit. In <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. San Roque Power Corporation,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> we emphasized that compliance with the 120-day waiting period is mandatory and <b>jurisdictional</b>. In this case, when TSC filed its administrative claim on 21 December 2005, the CIR had a period of 120 days, or until 20 April 2006, to act on the claim. However, the CIR failed to act on TSC's claim within this 120-day period. Thus, TSC filed its petition for review with the CTA on 24 April 2006 or within 30 days after the expiration of the 120-day period. Accordingly, we do not find merit in the CIR's argument that the judicial claim was prematurely filed.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we <b>DENY</b> the petition for lack of merit.
