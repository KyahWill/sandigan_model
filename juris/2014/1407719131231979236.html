The petition did not pray for or cover reliefs founded on the resolution of the illegal dismissal issue, <i>i.e.</i>, the propriety of reinstating the petitioners and the award of backwages and other monetary benefits.<br><br>The illegal dismissal issue and the additional reliefs, however, were resolved and included in the Court’s September 17, 2008 Resolution which granted the petitioners’ motion for clarification and/or amplification.

The established rule is that the transfer of interest should occur <i>during the pendency</i> of the action in court, which clearly does not obtain in the present case. The transfer to the PSALM preceded the circumstances leading to the filing of the present action. The transfer of NPC’s assets and liabilities was made pursuant to the EPIRA, which became effective on June 26, 2001; the present action, on the other hand, was instituted in December 2002, after the assailed NPB resolutions were passed.<br><br>In our December 2, 2009 Resolution, the Court ruled that the word “existing” in Section 49 of the EPIRA refers only to “NPC generation assets,” and is not limited to existing liabilities of the NPC at the time of transfer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> In other words, the PSALM acquired all liabilities of the NPC, whether already existing or not at the time of the transfer.<br><br>The PSALM disagrees, noting that the last sentence of Section 49 of the EPIRA declared that the PSALM shall assume only the <i>outstanding</i> obligations of the NPC. The intent to limit the transferred liabilities of the NPC only to outstanding obligations may also be inferred, by analogy, from Section 60 of the EPIRA, which transferred to the PSALM only the <i>outstanding</i> financial obligations of electric cooperatives to the National Electrification Authority and other government agencies. Clarifying Section 60 of the EPIRA, Section 2, Rule 31 of its Implementing Rules and Regulations (<i>IRR</i>) states that <i>financial obligations</i> refer to “liabilities, or amounts payable by the ECs to NEA and other government agencies as of 26 June 2001.”<br><br>Also, Section 56 of the EPIRA<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> (and its counterpart provision in the IRR, Section 12 of Rule 21<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup>) expressly enumerated the claims the PSALM assumed, and this enumeration should be interpreted strictly and exclusively.<br><br>The PSALM contends that it is the exclusive owner of the assets it acquired from the NPC, and should not be treated as a mere successor-in-interest of the NPC. The PSALM and the NPC are separate and distinct government-owned and -controlled corporations. The PSALM was created with the objective of liquidating all the financial obligations and stranded contract costs of the NPC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> This objective notwithstanding, the PSALM should not be treated as a liquidator of the NPC; it does not exist solely to wind up the NPC’s business. The PSALM conducts its business not for the benefit of the NPC, but in pursuance of its own mandate. Neither is the PSALM acting as trustee of the NPC. The PSALM does not hold the assets in trust for the NPC, but has acquired their full ownership.<br><br>Congressional deliberations further show that the thrust of the EPIRA was to bailout the NPC from its financial obligations arising from direct contractual obligations with banking and financial institutions. The PSALM’s assets and privatization funds have been earmarked by Congress for the liquidation of the NPC’s debt, thus, beyond the reach of execution or garnishment.<br><br>If garnishment of the PSALM’s assets is allowed, adverse consequences will follow. The PSALM would be unable to fulfill its mandate within its limited term of existence – it will not be able to liquidate the assets and obligations it acquired and it will default from paying the loans and obligations it assumed. It would also be unable to contract further loans because financial institutions would be wary of its capability to pay. The National Government would have to step up as guarantor of the loans, and ultimately, these will be shouldered by the Filipino people as part of the Universal Charge that is imposed on all end-users of electricity.<br><br>The PSALM further contends that the assailed NPB resolutions were solely the NPC’s acts, and it had no participation whatsoever. The Court’s December 2, 2009 Resolution inequitably held the PSALM responsible for the acts of the NPC, although the PSALM was never formally impleaded as a party to the case. Assuming that the PSALM is an indispensable party to the case, the failure to implead it renders the entire proceedings null and void for failure to afford it due process.<br><br>Section 63 of the EPIRA actually declares that the separation pay and other benefits to be given to displaced or separated NPC employees shall be “in accordance with existing laws, rules or regulations.” There is nothing in Section 63 of the EPIRA that made the PSALM liable to pay these benefits. Section 4, Rule 13 of the IRR of the EPIRA has actually identified the source of funding for the payment of the benefits, i.e., the Government Service Insurance System or the NPC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>THE COURT’S RULING</u></b></center><br>The six (6) pending motions raise matters relating to the proper execution of the final September 26, 2006 Decision and September 17, 2008 Resolution because of certain events that arose after the filing of the petition, whose existence became known to the Court only during the execution stage of our final rulings.<br><br>As embodied in the five (5) issues confronting this Court, we have considered the factual and legal aspects of these challenges in light of our final rulings.

Any change that might have resulted in the issuance of NPB Resolution No. 2003-11 and NPC Circular No. 2003-09 only affected the computation of <i>the amount of separation benefits</i> to be received by the petitioners, not the persons to be benefited (<i>i.e.,</i> all NPC employees) as determined under the clear terms of our final rulings.<br><br><b><i>The Court has jurisdiction to rule on the <br>issue of the petitioners’ separation from<br>employment</i></b><br><br>Section 78 of the EPIRA provides the extent of the Court’s jurisdiction:<br><br><blockquote>Section 78.

In other words, the Court exercises jurisdiction on all questions involving the enforcement of the provisions of the EPIRA.<br><br>The EPIRA was enacted, among others, to privatize the assets and liabilities of the NPC. As part of the NPC’s privatization, Section 3 of the EPIRA mandates a “framework for the restructuring of the electric power industry, including the privatization of the assets of NPC, the transition to the desired competitive structure, and the definition of the responsibilities of the various government agencies and private entities.”<br><br>The term “restructuring” under Section 4 of the EPIRA refers to the “process of reorganizing the electric power industry in order to introduce higher efficiency, greater innovation and end-user choice.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> Restructuring “shall be understood as covering a <i>range of alternatives</i> enhancing exposure of the industry to competitive market forces.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> <b>The displacement and separation of employees in affected agencies are among the “alternatives” that may be adopted as part of the restructuring program, as recognized by Section 63 of the EPIRA</b>, which reads:<br><br><blockquote>Section 63.

In no case shall there be any diminution of benefits under the separation plan until the full implementation of the restructuring and privatization. Displaced or separated personnel as a result of the privatization, if qualified, shall be given preference in the hiring of the manpower requirements of the privatized companies.</blockquote><br>Section 63 is enforced by Section 33 of the IRR of the EPIRA, which provides:<br><br><blockquote><center>RULE 33.

Specifically, NPB Resolution No. 2002-124 provided the <i>Guidelines on the Separation Program of the National Power Corporation (NPC), and the Selection and Placement of Personnel in the NPC Table of Organization under Republic Act No. 9136</i>. NPB Resolution No. 2002-125 provided for the constitution of a Transition Team to coordinate the NPC’s Table of Organization.<br><br>Based on these considerations, there is no question that the validity of the separation from employment of the NPC employees fall within the Court’s jurisdiction under Section 78 of the EPIRA, as it involves the proper implementation of the provisions of the EPIRA. Precisely for this reason, the petitioners filed with this Court their petition for injunction against the implementation of the nullified NPB Resolutions, as these resolutions would effectively separate them from their employment if not restrained.<br><br>We are not unmindful of the CSC’s jurisdiction over all members of the civil service. Section 4 of the Uniform Rules squarely places the issue of the petitioners’ separation from employment within the CSC’s jurisdiction. It is not amiss to note however that <b>the CSC’s jurisdiction under Section 4 of the Uniform Rules is <i>not exclusive</i> and,</b> as provided by its provisions, <i><b>may be exercised concurrently with another office.</b></i> The second paragraph of Section 4 of the Uniform Rules provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 4. <i>Jurisdiction of the Civil Service Commission.</i> – x x x<br><br><b><u>Except as otherwise provided by the Constitution or by law</u></b>, the Civil Service Commission shall have the final authority to pass upon the removal, separation and suspension of all officers and employees in the civil service and upon all matters relating to the conduct, discipline and efficiency of such officers and employees.

However, even under a prayer for general relief, only reliefs allied to, and not entirely distinct from, that specifically asked may be granted. This rule has also been applied to pleadings. Thus, where a party has prayed only for specific relief or reliefs as to a specific subject matter, usually no different relief may be granted. However, <b>where a prayer for general relief is added to the demand of specific relief, the court may grant such other appropriate relief as may be consistent with the allegations and proofs</b>.</blockquote><br>A facial examination of the petition showed that it contained a prayer for both general and specific reliefs, thus:<br><br><blockquote><b><i>WHEREFORE</i></b>, it is most respectfully prayed:<br><ol><li>A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER (TRO) be issued immediately ex parte upon the filing of this petition enjoining, prohibiting and restraining the respondents from implementing the questioned NP Board Resolutions and, thus, maintain and pressure the status quo pending resolution of the prayer for issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction;<br><br></li><li>Upon notice and hearing, a writ of preliminary injunction be issued enjoining, prohibiting and restraining respondents from implementing the questioned NP Board Resolutions pending the final resolution and decision of the present petition.<br><br></li><li>After hearing on the merits to grant the petition and declare the writ of preliminary injunction perpetual and permanent.</li></ol><b>Other reliefs and remedies as may be just and equitable are also prayed for.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup></blockquote><br>The specific reliefs asked for in the petition are found in items 1, 2 and 3, which include the issuance of a temporary restraining order (<i>TRO</i>) pending the resolution of the petition and the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction enjoining, prohibiting and restraining the NPC to implement the nullified Board resolutions. In turn, the general relief asked for is contained in the prayer for “[o]ther reliefs and remedies just and equitable.” The general reliefs are based on the allegations in the petition.<br><br>To our mind, <b>the resolution of the issue on the propriety of the separation of all NPC employees under the nullified NPB Resolution Nos. 2002-124 and 2002-125 was included as part of the petition’s prayer for general relief.</b> The allegations in the petition undoubtedly questioned the validity of the NPB resolutions, which contained a Restructuring Plan that included the “measures and guidelines for the separation, termination and hiring of NPC employees and officials.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup><br><br>As reflected in the petition’s third cause of action, the petitioners emphasized that the nullified NPB resolutions “will have adverse effect to about 5,684 employees and officials”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> of the NPC “and will result to [sic] the removal and displacement of about 2,370 of such employees and officials most of whom will come from the ranks of the herein petitioners.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> A facial examination of the petition’s Allegations in Support of Application for Issuance of a TRO and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction also reveals the effect of the implementation of the nullified NPB resolutions to the employment of all NPC employees. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup><br><br>The above circumstances justify the modification of our final September 26, 2006 Decision, as the September 17, 2008 Resolution clarified the consequences of our Decision.

The inclusion of the word “existing” in Section 49 simply clarified the<b> intent of the EPIRA to limit the transfer only to those enumerated NPC properties that already existed at the time of the EPIRA’s effectivity. </b>Thus, the appreciation of the enumeration of assets in Sections 47, 50, and 55 of the EPIRA should be made in the same way, <i>i.e.,</i> it should refer only to the <i>generation assets, real estate, IPP contracts, and other disposable assets of the NPC existing at the time of the EPIRA’s effectivity.</i><br><br>However, the above interpretation is by no means an all-encompassing description of the NPC properties that were transferred to the PSALM. The PSALM acquired NPC properties other than those enumerated in the above-quoted portions of Sections 47, 49, 50, and 55 of the EPIRA, which properties may or may not have existed at the time the law took effect. These other properties are covered and governed by other provisions of the EPIRA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup> Insofar as generation assets, liabilities, IPP contracts, real estate, and all other disposable assets of the NPC are concerned, only those existing as of June 26, 2001 (the effective date of the EPIRA) were transferred to the PSALM.<br><br>In the same manner that “existing” modifies the assets transferred from the NPC to the PSALM, <b>the liabilities transferred from the NPC to the PSALM under Section 49 of the EPIRA are also limited to those existing at the time of the effectivity of the law.</b> In this regard, we consider significant the purpose and objective of creating the PSALM, the powers conferred to it, and the duration of its existence.<br><br>Section 50 of the EPIRA states that “the principal purpose of the PSALM Corp. is to manage the orderly sale, disposition, and privatization of NPC generation assets, real estate and other disposable assets and IPP contracts with the objective of liquidating all NPC financial obligations and stranded contract costs in an optimal manner.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup> Pursuant to this purpose, the PSALM was conferred the power “to formulate and implement a program for the sale and privatization of the NPC assets and IPP contracts and the liquidation of NPC debts and stranded contract costs, <b>such liquidation to be completed <u>within the term of existence of the PSALM Corp.</u>”</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup> Under Section 50 of the EPIRA, the<b> PSALM is to exist for a period of 25 years from the law’s effectivity.</b><br><br>Considering the limited period of existence for the PSALM’s discharge of its mandate, it would be absurd and iniquitous to hold it liable for liabilities and obligations incurred by the NPC even after the EPIRA’s effectivity. Note that despite privatization, the NPC continues to exist and perform missionary electrification functions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup> In discharging these missionary electrification functions, the NPC would certainly acquire assets and incur liabilities. To hold the PSALM liable for the NPC’s post-EPIRA liabilities and obligations, particularly those not arising from existing liabilities and obligations, is clearly contrary to the declared policy of the EPIRA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup><br><br>The second sentence of Section 49 of the EPIRA further confirms the interpretation that only existing NPC liabilities were transferred to the PSALM. The EPIRA requires that “[a]ll <b><i>outstanding obligations</i></b> of the NPC arising from loans, issuances of bonds, securities, and other instruments of indebtedness shall be transferred to and assumed by PSALM Corp. within one hundred eighty (180) days from the approval of this Act.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup><br><br>These “outstanding obligations x x x arising from x x x instruments of indebtedness” fall within the broader classification of “existing liabilities” of the NPC that PSALM acquired. The only difference is that the outstanding obligations from instruments of indebtedness must be transferred to PSALM within 180 days from the approval of the EPIRA. But the 180-day period merely refers to the period within which the transfer should be effected; it does not authorize the transfer of obligations incurred during the same 180-day period from the EPIRA’s approval.<br><br>The EPIRA provided a 180-day period for the transfer of these obligations in order for the ERC to be able to determine, fix and approve the universal charge that shall be imposed on all electricity end-users within one (1) year from its approval.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup> Under Section 34 of the EPIRA, the universal charge shall answer for the <i>stranded debts</i> of the NPC or those “unpaid obligations of the NPC which have not been liquidated by the proceeds from the sales and privatization of NPC assets.” The outstanding obligations arising from instruments of indebtedness that Section 49 of the EPIRA refers to may be considered as “stranded debts of NPC” that shall be satisfied by the universal charge collected from electricity consumers.<br><br>Are the separation benefits of the NPC officials and employees an “existing liability” of the NPC at the time of the EPIRA’s effectivity that would make the PSALM liable? Based on Section 63 of<b> the EPIRA, the separation benefits are undoubtedly existing liabilities of the NPC.</b><br><br>The separation of NPC employees affected by its reorganization and privatization was a foregone conclusion. In recognition of this, the EPIRA gave the assurance that these employees shall receive the separation pay and other benefits due them under existing laws, rules or regulations or be able to avail of the privileges under a separation plan which shall be one and one-half month salary for every year of service in the government.<b> The employees’ separation being an unavoidable consequence of the mandated restructuring and privatization of the NPC, the liability to pay for their separation benefits should be deemed existing as of the EPIRA’s effectivity, and were thus transferred to PSALM pursuant to Section 49 of the law.</b><br><br><b><i>The failure to implead PSALM does not<br> defeat the execution of the final judgment <br>against the assets it acquired from the NPC;<br> PSALM is a necessary party</i></b><br><br>Since the PSALM assumed NPC’s liabilities for its separated employees upon the effectivity of the EPIRA and prior to the commencement of the petitioners’ action, the PSALM was <b>not</b> a transferee <i>pendente lite</i>. A transferee <i>pendente lite</i> is a successor-in-interest of the parties by title subsequent to the commencement of the action and is bound by the judgment or final order.<br><br>Our discussion settled that the PSALM assumed the NPC’s liabilities that were existing at the time of the EPIRA’s effectivity, and these existing liabilities included the separation benefits due the petitioners. Would it be fair to hold PSALM liable for the separation benefits of the petitioners when PSALM was never formally impleaded as a party to the case? The PSALM claims that as an indispensable party to the case, the failure to implead it renders the entire proceedings void for failure to afford it due process.<br><br>Section 7, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court defines indispensable parties as parties-in-interest <b>without whom there can be no final determination of an action</b>; thus, they must be joined either as plaintiffs or as defendants. An indispensable party is one who has such an interest in the controversy or subject matter that a final adjudication cannot be made in its absence without injuring or affecting that interest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup> Insofar as this case is originally concerned, <b>PSALM was not an indispensable party</b>.<br><br>We note that what is at issue before the Court now involves matters of <i>execution </i>of our final judgment. The case, however, <i>originated from a petition for injunction</i> instituted by the petitioners against NPC to assail NPB Resolution Nos. 2002-125 and 2002-125. PSALM itself has pointed out that the assailed resolutions were solely NPC acts, of which it had no participation whatsoever. <b>Having no interest in the assailed NPC resolutions, PSALM therefore cannot be deemed an indispensable party which should have been impleaded in the injunctive suit.</b><br><br>The petitioners commenced the action <i>before</i> their separation from employment could be effected pursuant to the assailed NPB resolutions. Unfortunately, no TRO or preliminary injunction was issued and NPC proceeded with the termination of the employment of the petitioners. By declaring that the “petitioners have the right to reinstatement or separation pay in lieu of reinstatement…, plus backwages, wage adjustments, and other benefits” in the September 17, 2008 Resolution, the Court implicitly recognized that the actual termination of the petitioners’ employment constituted a supervening event which had to be addressed to give effect to the final ruling invalidating the NPC resolutions. At this stage of the case, i.e., the execution of the Court’s final judgment, PSALM’s participation becomes relevant.<br><br>The PSALM acquired the majority of the NPC’s properties, in fact, even the net profits NPC would acquire belonged to PSALM. The NPC retained only the assets of the small power utilities groups, and its function has been limited to missionary electrification, i.e., providing power generation and its associated power delivery systems in areas that are not connected to the transmission system.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup> Between NPC and the PSALM, the latter is in a better financial position to answer for the separation benefits due the petitioners. Recognizing that the separation from service of thousands of employees would result from the mandated restructuring and privatization of NPC, the EPIRA could not have intended for NPC to solely answer for the separation benefits which, by NPC’s estimation, would amount to billions of pesos. For NPC to solely answer for these liabilities may ultimately result in its financial ruin, contrary to the intent of the EPIRA.<br><br>Under Section 50 of the EPIRA, the PSALM was created to liquidate all financial obligations of the NPC and these financial obligations undoubtedly included the separation benefits due the petitioners. The <b>PSALM should thus be considered</b> not as an indispensable party, but <b>as a necessary party</b> who ought to be joined as a party if <b>complete relief</b> is to be accorded as to those already parties, or <b>for a complete determination or settlement of the claim</b> subject of the action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup> Section 11, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court state that “[p]arties may be x x x added by order of the court on motion of any party or on its own initiative at any stage of the action and on such terms as may be just.”<br><br>In light of these considerations and the opportunity given to PSALM to argue its position before the Court, we deem it fair and just to uphold the PSALM’s liability for the separation benefits due the petitioners, consistent with our December 2, 2009 resolution.<br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY"><b>(6) </b></div></td> <td valign="TOP" width="40%"><div align="JUSTIFY"><b> OTHER ISSUES - Motions for Contempt filed by the petitioners and the NPC</b></div></td> <td valign="TOP" width="55%">&nbsp;</td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>“Contempt of court is defiance of court authority that tends to degrade the dignity of the court and bring the administration of the law into [disrepute], or an act that interferes with or prejudices parties-litigants or their witnesses during litigation thereby impeding the administration of justice.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup> It is also defined as the disobedience to the Court by acting in opposition to its authority, justice, and dignity, and signifies a willful disregard or disobedience of the court’s orders; it is a conduct that tends to bring the authority of the court and the administration of law into disrepute or otherwise impedes the administration of justice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[141]</sup><br><br>In several cases,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[142]</sup> we explained that the power to punish for contempt is inherent in all courts and is essential to the preservation of order in judicial proceedings and to the enforcement of judgments, orders, and mandates of the court, and, consequently, to the due administration of justice.

Only occasionally should the court invoke its inherent power in order to retain that respect, without which the administration of justice will falter or fail.

Mr. Anguluan, however, is not among the NPC officials identified in the December 2, 2009 Resolution who were tasked to comply with the Court’s directives. It further points out that Mr. Anguluan did not have the authority to furnish the required list of employees.<br><br>In their Comment, Atty.

Ele and the RTC sheriffs had to request Mr. Anguluan to furnish the required list considering the inaction of the NPC, the eagerness of the counsel of the petitioners to have our final rulings executed, and the time constraints imposed by the Court.<br><br>The imputed deviation is also negated by the procedure that Atty.

Labor Arbiter Calanza</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[165]</sup> that to be considered contemptuous, the act of disobedience must be clearly contrary to or prohibited by the order of the court or tribunal. We declared that “a person cannot, for disobedience, be punished for contempt unless the act which is forbidden or required to be done is clearly and exactly defined, so that there can be no reasonable doubt or uncertainty as to what specific act or thing is forbidden or required.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[166]</sup><br><br>In the past, we have recognized several factors indicative of contumacious conduct for disobedience of lawful writ or order,<i> i.e.,</i> the time element or lapse of time to comply with our final judgment, the sincerity and good faith of the losing party, and the repeated erroneous computations pursuant to final judgment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[167]</sup> In <i>Lee v. Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 85,</i> we considered as contumacious conduct a party’s repeated attempts to raise issues already laid to rest by a final and executory judgment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[168]</sup><br><br>The totality of circumstances in the present case amply support the contumacious conduct exhibited by the NPC and the OSG in failing to comply with our final rulings. We start with the time elapsed (or more than a year after the Court issued the first order of execution without any action from the NPC and the OSG) as a gauge of their willingness to comply in good faith with the directives as contemplated in our final rulings.<br><br>Also, their actions no less demonstrate bad faith and utter lack of sincerity based on the circumstance of the non-disclosure of NPB Resolution No. 2003-11 to the Court. It is not lost on us that NPB Resolution No. 2003-11, which amended NPB Resolution No. 2002-124, was issued a month after the filing of the case, but the NPC and the OSG informed the Court of its existence after more than six (6) years had passed and only after the finality of our final rulings. Their belated disclosure of NPB Resolution No. 2003-11 was made in order to support their “new” stand that only 16 NPC employees were affected by the nullified NPB Resolutions, in effect, mitigating its liability despite the clear import of our final rulings.<br><br>As mentioned in our December 2, 2009 Resolution, both the Court and the petitioners were made to believe that the issue in the petition involved the termination from employment of all NPC employees arising from the nullified NPB resolutions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[169]</sup> This belief was further strengthened by the pleadings (<i>i.e.</i>, motions for reconsideration) filed by the NPC through the OSG, assailing the final December 26, 2006 Decision. In these pleadings, the NPC hinted of a huge financial exposure resulting from the illegal termination of all NPC employees (not only 16 employees) under the nullified NPB resolutions.<br><br>We are also not unmindful that after the issuance of the final September 26, 2006 Decision, the NPC, to mitigate its liability from our final rulings, issued NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 that ratified any infirmity from NPB Resolution No. 2003-11 and other subsequent NPB resolutions affecting the termination from employment of all NPC employees. Like NPB Resolution No. 2003-11, the NPC and the OSG now use the existence of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 as part of a legal strategy to manipulate the execution of our final rulings in order to limit the NPC’s financial liability. In line with this strategy, the NPC and the OSG submitted a Compliance to our December 10, 2008 Resolution by submitting a list of only 16 employees, contrary to the clear import of our final rulings that contemplated the illegal termination of all NPC employees.<br><br>Further, we are also aware that the NPC and the OSG filed a motion for reconsideration against the December 2, 2009 Resolution, aimed at staying and delaying the execution of our final rulings. To our mind, this move did not have the benefit of any arguably justifiable grounds. The motion was plainly dilatory in character considering that its arguments raised had been passed upon in the December 2, 2009 Resolution and, more importantly, were already barred by estoppel and the immutability of judgment principle.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[170]</sup><br><br>In considering the contumacious conduct exhibited by the NPC, we also take note of the OSG’s participation by giving improper and unjustified advice to the NPC. Despite the finality of our final rulings, the OSG encouraged the NPC’s disobedience against our final rulings as shown in the letter dated October 8, 2008 of Assistant Solicitor General Roman G. del Rosario and Associate Solicitor General Aristotle R. Mejia to NPC President Atty. Cyril C. del Callar, thus:<br><br><blockquote>A review of pertinent circumstances disclosed that <b>the execution of the Supreme Court’s Decision dated 26 September 2006 may be challenged for cogent reasons.</b><br><br>Significantly,<b> since NPB Resolution No. 2007-55, including NPB Resolution Nos. 2003-01, 2003-11, 2003-12, and 2003-15 were not the subject of the Supreme Court Decision dated 26 September 2006, the same remains valid and effective.</b> Until nullified, these subsequent resolutions may be implemented more so – as they were issued with the approval of the NPB Members as specified by law x x x.<br><br><center>x x x x</center><br>In fine, NPB Resolution No. 2007-55, including NPB Resolution Nos. 2003-01, 2003-11, 2003-12, and 2003-15 are supervening events that bring about a material change in the situation between the parties which makes the execution inequitable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[171]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The OSG also allowed itself to be used as an instrument to delay the implementation of our final rulings. The records show that the OSG filed a motion for additional time<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[172]</sup> to “address” the December 10, 2008 Resolution in light of the letter dated February 5, 2009 of NPC President Froilan Tampinco to the then Solicitor General, Agnes VST Devanadera,:<br><br><blockquote>x x x in the light of the Opinion dated 8 October 2008 of the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) and in order to properly address the Supreme Court Resolution dated 10 December 2008 x x x.<br><br>x x x. We hope you understand the NPC predicament.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[173]</sup></blockquote><br>On the basis of the OSG’s opinion stated in the letter dated October 8, 2008, the NPC, through the OSG, filed its “compliance” with the December 10, 2008 Resolution which contravened the clear import of our final rulings.<br><br>The OSG, as officers of the court, “share in the task and responsibility of dispensing justice and resolving disputes,”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[174]</sup> in addition to its sworn duty to provide legal services to the Government. Under the circumstances, we can neither permit nor condone any act that obstructs, perverts or impedes and degrades the administration of justice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[175]</sup> For employing legal schemes to delay the execution of our final rulings that have long attained finality, the OSG is reminded of its following duties under the Code of Professional Responsibility, namely:<br><br><blockquote>CANON 1 - A LAWYER SHALL UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION, OBEY THE LAWS OF THE LAND AND PROMOTE RESPECT FOR LAW AND LEGAL PROCESSES.<br><br>Rule 1.04 - A lawyer shall encourage his clients to avoid, end or settle a controversy if it will admit of a fair settlement.<br><br>Rule 12.04 - A lawyer shall not unduly delay a case, impede the execution of a judgment or misuse Court processes.</blockquote><br>Canon 6 of the Code of Professional Responsibility provides that the above duties apply to lawyers in the government service in the discharge of their official tasks. In this case, the OSG failed to render effective legal service pursuant to the duties stated in the Code of Professional Responsibility. It failed to properly provide the appropriate advice to the NPC in the matter of accepting the Court’s ruling and on the effect of a final judgment. Instead, the OSG used its efforts and resources to look for legal loopholes and misused its knowledge of court procedure to relieve the NPC of our final rulings or otherwise forestall their inevitable execution. Clearly, the OSG overstepped due bounds in protecting the interests of the NPC. Thus, together with the NPC, the OSG’s actions constitute contumacious conduct no less.<br><br><center><b><u>CONCLUSIONS</u></b></center><br>We sum up all our discussions as follows:<br><br><b><u>First,</u></b> our final September 26, 2006 Decision and final September 17, 2008 Resolution contemplate and cover <b>all the NPC employees</b> whose illegal termination from employment stemmed from NPB Resolution No. 2002-124 and NPB Resolution No. 2002-125. Section 78 of the EPIRA vests the Court with jurisdiction to rule on the issue of the illegal termination of all the NPC employees as the issue was incidental to the implementation of the provisions of the EPIRA.<br><br>The NPC is barred by estoppel and by the principle of finality of judgment from raising arguments aimed at modifying our final rulings. Without any supporting exceptional reason or argument, the NPC and the OSG cannot repeatedly attack our final judgments by raising points that should have been raised prior to the finality of our rulings.<br><br><b><u>Second</u></b>, the September 17, 2008 Resolution did not grant additional reliefs not included in the September 26, 2006 Decision. The September 17, 2008 Resolution merely clarified the September 26, 2006 Decision by explaining the consequences of the earlier decision. Besides, the Court’s order of reinstatement or the payment of separation benefits to all the NPC employees illegally dismissed from employment under the nullified NPB resolution forms part of the general relief in the petition and the result of the specific reliefs prayed for therein.<br><br><b><u>Third</u></b>, the dispositive portion of the December 10, 2008 Resolution did not exceed the terms of the final September 17, 2008 Resolution. The terms stated in the December 10, 2008 Resolution were consistent with the terms of the final September 17, 2008 Resolution falling within the Court’s residual authority to see to the proper execution and enforcement of its final rulings. Similarly, the award of 12% legal interest accruing from the finality of judgment is proper; it is a natural consequence of a final judgment and did not affect the principle of immutability of judgment as we explained in the cases of <i>Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc., Session Delights Ice Cream &amp; Fast Foods, BPI Employees Union-Metro Manila and Gonzales</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[176]</sup><br><br><b><u>Fourth</u></b>, our final rulings declared the nullified NPB resolutions as void and without legal effect for being enacted in contravention of Section 48 of the EPIRA. With this final declaration, the nullified NPB Resolutions cannot be ratified. The issuance of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 did not affect our final rulings in light of its prospective application.<br><br><b><u>Fifth</u></b>, the PSALM assumed NPC’s liabilities existing at the time of the EPIRA’s effectivity, and these include the separation benefits due the petitioners.<br><br>As may be gathered from Sections 47, 49, 50 and 55 of the EPIRA law, the properties and liabilities of the NPC existing at the time of the EPIRA’s effectivity were transferred to the PSALM. These liabilities include the separation benefits due the petitioners whose termination from employment is acknowledged by the EPIRA as part of its mandated restructuring and privatization of the NPC. For this reason, the PSALM is considered as a necessary party and is impleaded in the case in order that complete relief may be accorded the parties.<br><br><b><u>Lastly</u></b>, the refusal by the NPC to comply with the December 10, 2008 Resolution and December 2, 2009 Resolution, implementing our final rulings, constitutes contumacious conduct for being unjustified and without legal and factual basis. The NPC and the OSG’s non-compliance with our final orders was attended with bad faith and utter lack of sincerity to abide by our resolutions. The contumacious conduct was demonstrated by the filing of dilatory pleadings raising arguments already barred by estoppel and contrary to the principle of immutability of judgment.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the Court resolves to:<br><ol><li><b>GRANT</b> the petitioners’ Manifestation with Ex-Parte Very Urgent Motion to Summarily Cite Respondents and their Counsels in Contempt of Court dated January 5, 2010.
