Garcia.”</i><br><br><b><center><u>The Facts</u></center></b><br>For the 3<sup>rd </sup>quarter of calendar year 1992, the PNP Office of the Directorate for Comptrollership issued and released two Advice of Sub-Allotments<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> (ASA): (1) ASA No. 4363 dated 11 August 1992 for P5,000,000, and (2) ASA No. 4400 dated 18 August 1992 for P15,000,000, in the total amount of P20,000,000, for the purchase of combat clothing and individual equipment (CCIE) items of the Cordillera Regional Command (CRECOM) of the Philippine National Police (PNP) located at Camp Bado, Dangwa, La Trinidad, Benguet.<br><br>The ASAs were addressed “For the Chief, Philippine National Police; by Guillermo T. Domondon, Director.” The PNP Chief and PNP Director for Comptrollership at the time were Cesar P. Nazareno (Nazareno) and Guillermo T. Domondon (Domondon), respectively. On behalf of Domondon, the ASAs were signed by P/Supt. Van Luspo (Luspo), then Chief, Fiscal Division, Budget and Fiscal Services of the PNP Directorate for Comptrollership, by virtue of a Memorandum<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> dated 31 January 1991, where Domondon gave Luspo and a certain Supt. Reynold Osia, the authority to sign for him and on his behalf, allotments for personal services in the amount not exceeding Five Million Pesos (P5,000,000), and in his absence, the amount of Twenty Million Pesos (P20,000,000). Thereafter, the proceeds of the two ASAs were transferred to CRECOM’s deposit account with the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP), Baguio Branch.<br><br>After receipt of the ASAs, petitioner Chief Inspector Danilo O. Garcia (Garcia), then CRECOM Assistant Regional Director for Comptrollership, directed the preparation of cash advances in the form of 15 disbursement vouchers,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> 4 dated 12 August 1992 and 11 dated 21 August 1992, in the total amount of P20,000,000. The disbursement vouchers were signed and approved by either Garcia or Armand D. Agbayani (Agbayani), then CRECOM Regional Director, and issued in favor of petitioner Chief Inspector Joven SD. Brizuela (Brizuela), then CRECOM Disbursing Officer, as lone payee and claimant.<br><br>After the approval of the disbursement vouchers, Chief Inspector Juan Luna (Luna), then CRECOM Finance Officer, issued 250 LBP checks<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> (Check Nos. 037483-037533 and 037584-037783) of various dates, from 11 to 22 August 1992, in the amounts of P50,000 or P100,000 totalling to P20,000,000. Luna and Garcia were the signatories of the checks issued in the amount of P50,000, while Luna and Agbayani were the signatories of checks amounting to P100,000. The 250 LBP checks were all issued in favor of Brizuela as payee, in his capacity as disbursing officer.<br><br>On 13 August 1992, Brizuela encashed the check dated 11 August 1992 from the LBP, Baguio Branch. Again, on 26 August 1992, Brizuela encashed the checks dated 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22 August 1992. All the proceeds of the encashed checks amounting to P20,000,000 were turned over by Brizuela to Garcia in the presence of Luna.<br><br>For the purpose of liquidating the cash advances, CRECOM Regional Accountant Jocelyn Versoza-Hinanay received the following documents: (1) original copies of the disbursement vouchers; (2) 250 LBP checks; (3) corresponding Clothing Requirements and Certifications that were signed by the heads of the various commands and units of CRECOM; and (4) PNP Personnel Payrolls that were also signed by the various CRECOM command heads, “approved payable” by Luna, and certified by Brizuela that the amount of P11,270.00 representing CCIE for the 3rd quarter of 1992 was paid to each “payee whose name appears on the (above) payroll.”<br><br>The various CRECOM command and unit heads, who allegedly signed the Clothing Requirements and Certifications and the PNP Personnel Payrolls, were identified as:<br><br><blockquote>(1) Supt. Manuel T. Raval of PNP Abra;<br>(2) Supt. Rolando C. Garcia of PNP Benguet;<br>(3) C/Insp. Prospero C. Noble, Jr. of PNP Ifugao;<br>(4) Supt. Rodrigo F.

Cabigas of the Headquarter Services.</blockquote><br>Thereafter, for post-audit purposes, the documents were submitted to Adelaida C. Urbanozo (Urbanozo), State Auditor II of the Commission on Audit (COA) assigned at CRECOM PNP.<br><br>On 26 February 1993, after the post-audit, PNP Chief Inspector General Benjamin Valenton directed a PNP IG Fact-Finding Team to conduct an investigation on the alleged fictitious CCIE purchase of CRECOM PNP worth P20,000,000. The fact finding team was composed of team leader P/Supt. Rafael Jayme, P/C Insp. Ricardo M. Orot (Orot) and P/Sr. Insp. Evangeline L.

Garcia and Brizuela.<br><br>In an Investigation Report<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> dated 2 April 1993, the fact finding team revealed the irregularity of the release of the ASAs worth P20,000,000 by the PNP Office of the Directorate for Comptrollership. Based on the documents collected and the sworn statements taken from CRECOM personnel and other witnesses, the fact finding team discovered the following: (1) that the ASAs were issued without the corresponding Personnel Program from the PNP Directorate of Personnel, the office which determines the needs of the units of the PNP; (2) that the ASAs were received by CRECOM Comptroller Garcia from PNP Headquarters; (3) that Garcia received the proceeds of the ASAs from CRECOM Disbursing Officer Brizuela in the presence of CRECOM Finance Officer Luna after Brizuela encashed the 250 LBP checks; and (4) that all the liquidating documents, consisting of the Clothing Requirement and Certifications and the list of the PNP Personnel Payrolls, supposedly signed by the various CRECOM command and unit heads, were all fictitious. The signatures appearing in the liquidating documents were forged and the personnel listed in the respective Official Rosters of the officers’ commands did not receive any CCIE for the 3rd quarter of 1992.<br><br>On 11 May 1993, the fact finding team filed its Investigation Report and recommended the filing of appropriate criminal charges with the Sandiganbayan against Nazareno, Domondon, Agbayani, Garcia, Luna, and Brizuela for (1) Malversation through Falsification of Public Documents, and (2) violation of Republic Act No. 3019 (RA 3019) or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.<br><br>After the preliminary investigation, the Office of the Ombudsman filed an Amended Information<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> dated 28 July 1997 for violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019, docketed as Criminal Case No. 20574, against all the police personnel, as recommended by the fact finding team, allegedly involved in the procurement of the fraudulent CCIE purchase, including Luspo.

The relevant portions of the Order state:<br><br><blockquote>1. Gen. Prospero C.

Supt. Juan T.

However, since Dalut had already testified before another division of the Sandiganbayan in other cases, where some of the accused in this case were also the accused in the other cases, Domondon and Luspo merely adopted the testimony of Dalut in those cases, including the cross-examination conducted on Dalut.<br><br>Accused Brizuela presented the prosecution’s witness, Candia, as his witness pursuant to a <i>subpoena</i> issued by the Sandiganbayan. After the presentation of Candia, Brizuela did not present any other testimonial evidence and merely adopted the testimonial and documentary evidence of the other accused.<br><br>Likewise, accused Garcia did not present any testimonial evidence and merely adopted the evidence of the other accused.<br><br>Accused Luna, on the other hand, testified on his behalf and presented documentary evidence.<br><br>On 8 December 2005, while this case was pending, Nazareno died. Upon motion to dismiss filed by counsel, with the original certificate of death issued by the Office of the Civil Registrar as basis, the Sandiganbayan issued an Order dated 3 February 2007 dismissing the case against Nazareno.<br><br>On 14 October 2010, the Sandiganbayan found Brizuela, Luna and Garcia guilty of the crime charged and acquitted Domondon and Luspo. The dispositive portion of the Decision states:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered finding accused JOVEN SD. BRIZUELA, JUAN G. LUNA, and DANILO O.

Respondents also question petitioners’ defense of regularity in the performance of their functions as Assistant Regional Director for Comptrollership and Disbursing Officer which was raised only for the first time before the Sandiganbayan when they filed their separate supplements to their motions for reconsideration.<br><br>Petitioners were charged for violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 which states:<br><br><blockquote>Section 3.<i> Corrupt practices of public officers. –</i> In addition to acts or omissions of public officers already penalized by existing law, the following shall constitute corrupt practices of any public officer and are hereby declared to be unlawful:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(e) Causing any undue injury to any party, including the Government, or giving any private party any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his official, administrative or judicial functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence. This provision shall apply to officers and employees of offices or government corporations charged with the grant of licenses or permits or other concessions.</blockquote><br>The three essential elements for violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 are: (1) that the accused is a public officer discharging administrative, judicial or official functions; (2) that the accused acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence; and (3) that the accused caused undue injury to any party including the Government, or giving any private party unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his functions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>On the first element, the records show that at the time the procurement of the CCIE occurred, petitioners Garcia and Brizuela were public officers discharging their officials functions in the Philippine National Police as Assistant Regional Director for Comptrollership and Disbursing Officer, respectively. In the course of the trial, the Sandiganbayan issued a Pre-Trial Order dated 17 May 2005 which contained the stipulation of fact that “all the accused were public officers, occupying their respective positions as described in the Information, at the time the matters of this case allegedly occurred.” Thus, petitioners were public officials holding positions in the PNP on the questioned dates as clearly stipulated in the Amended Information filed by the Ombudsman. Indisputably, the first element was met.<br><br>With regard to the second element, that the public officer acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence, the case of <i>Albert v. Sandiganbayan</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> explained the different modes by which the crime may be committed:<br><br><blockquote>The second element provides the different modes by which the crime may be committed, that is, through “manifest partiality,” “evident bad faith,” or “gross inexcusable negligence.” In <i>Uriarte v. People, </i>this Court explained that Section 3(e) of RA 3019 may be committed either by <i>dolo</i>, as when the accused acted with evident bad faith or manifest partiality, or by <i>culpa</i>, as when the accused committed gross inexcusable negligence. There is “manifest partiality” when there is a clear, notorious, or plain inclination or predilection to favor one side or person rather than another. “Evident bad faith” connotes not only bad judgment but also palpably and patently fraudulent and dishonest purpose to do moral obliquity or conscious wrongdoing for some perverse motive or ill will. “Evident bad faith” contemplates a state of mind affirmatively operating with furtive design or with some motive or self-interest or ill will or for ulterior purposes. “Gross inexcusable negligence” refers to negligence characterized by the want of even the slightest care, acting or omitting to act in a situation where there is a duty to act, not inadvertently but willfully and intentionally, with conscious indifference to consequences insofar as other persons may be affected.</blockquote><br>In this case, the Amended Information<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> filed by the Ombudsman specifically states “evident bad faith” as the mode by which the crime has been committed. As defined in <i>Albert</i>, <b>evident bad faith</b> connotes not only bad judgment but also palpably and patently fraudulent and dishonest purpose to do moral obliquity or conscious wrongdoing for some perverse motive or ill will. It contemplates a state of mind affirmatively operating with furtive design or with some motive or self interest or ill will or for ulterior purposes.<br><br>In their petition, Garcia and Brizuela maintain that their duties and functions in the PNP show that they did not participate in the alleged crime. Garcia asserts that while he was the Assistant Regional Director for Comptrollership (ARDC) at the time of the purchase of the fictitious CCIE items, his functions as ARDC would show that he did not take part in the anomalous offense. Garcia states that it was incumbent upon him, in his ministerial function as ARDC, to control and employ funds through the preparation of Request for Obligation of Allotment (ROA) and Regional Allotment Advice (RAA). Garcia emphasizes that he was not a signatory to the disbursement vouchers contrary to the allegation of the prosecution that he directed the preparation of the 15 disbursement vouchers totalling P20,000,000. Garcia states that it was only a matter of procedure that he affixed his signature at the dorsal portion of the disbursement vouchers to manifest that a pre-audit and inspection had been conducted. As ARDC, it was his management function to conduct the pre-audit and inspection before any payment or disbursement was made. Garcia adds that he merely complied with the directive when the ASAs were issued “For the Chief, Philippine National Police” by Domondon, although the ASAs were signed for Domondon by Luspo, then Chief of the Fiscal Division, Budget and Fiscal Services of the PNP Directorate for Comptrollership. Garcia further claims that he was not privy to and had no direct or implied participation in the payroll presentation although his name appeared in the payrolls submitted. Garcia alleges that his purported signatures affixed in the payrolls were forged.<br><br>On the other hand, petitioner Brizuela insists that while he was the payee indicated in the questioned disbursement vouchers and LBP checks, he was merely performing his duty as Disbursing Officer to disburse funds against approved expense vouchers. This assigned task was given by the Regional Director who had the authority and the right to command and demand compliance upon him as a subordinate. Brizuela adds that his compliance with a perceived lawful order does not connote that he committed the offense through manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence, as defined in the second element of Section 3(e) of RA 3019.<br><br>We are not convinced.<br><br>Petitioners anchor their defense on the nature of their respective positions to prove that they acted within the bounds of their functions.

After the vouchers were signed and approved, Luna issued 250 LBP checks in the amounts of P50,000 and P100,000. Garcia and Luna were the signatories of the P50,000 checks and Luna and Agbayani were the signatories of the P100,000 checks.

Given that Garcia performed his duty from the preparation of the ROA and RAA until the approval of the disbursement vouchers in accordance with his regular duties and functions in the PNP, he did not refute the allegation made by Brizuela that he turned over the total amount of P20,000,000 to Garcia in the presence of Luna. As attested by the Sworn Statement<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> of Brizuela on 22 February 1993 taken by Candia in the presence of Orot at the Office of the PNP Inspector General, Camp Crame, Quezon City, Brizuela admitted that after encashing the 250 LBP checks in the total amount of P20,000,000, he gave the entire amount to Garcia:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="20%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Candia: </div></td> <td width="80%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Showing you a list of checks and bundle of checks with a total of 250 checks submitted by Ms. Jocelyn S.

However, Garcia did not endeavor to prove otherwise. Forgery cannot be presumed and must be proved by clear, positive and convincing evidence<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> and the burden of proof lies on the party alleging forgery.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> In the present case, Garcia merely relied on the evidence of the other accused and did not present his own testimonial and documentary evidence to show that his signature in the personnel payrolls were falsified. Thus, the presumption of validity and regularity prevails over allegations of forgery and fraud.<br><br>Brizuela, on the other hand, insists that as the named payee in the questioned disbursement vouchers and LBP checks, he was merely performing his regular duty as disbursing officer to disburse funds against approved expense vouchers. However, contrary to his allegation, Brizuela admitted in his sworn statement that he gave the entire amount of P20,000,000 to Garcia after encashing the checks. Brizuela did not even question why the said amount should be turned over to Garcia nor did Brizuela report the unusual transaction to higher authorities. He even raised the defense of compliance with a superior’s perceived lawful order and disowned accountability for funds he disbursed which were eventually used for illegal or unauthorized purposes. The facts as established show that Brizuela took part in the act of issuing and encashing government checks, then in misappropriating the funds by submitting documents showing that the funds were allegedly used to pay personnel in the payroll but the personnel later turned out to be fictitious persons. As CRECOM Disbursing Officer, Brizuela should have seen to it that the funds were legally and properly disbursed for the purpose for which they were released. Clearly, Brizuela’s actions were tainted with evident bad faith.<br><br>Even Luna, in his Sworn Statement<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> on 4 March 1993 taken by Candia in the presence of Orot at the PNP Office of Complaint and Investigation Division, Camp Crame, Quezon City, admitted that he signed the 250 LBP checks and that he was present when the P20,000,000 cash was handed by Brizuela to Garcia.

The relevant portions of the Decision state:<br><br><blockquote>It appears, however, that the names of the personnel listed in the said <i>PNP Personnel Payrolls</i> who purportedly have each received the amount of P11,270.00 CCIE for the 3rd Quarter of 1992 are fabricated or fictitious because the names listed therein, when compared with the Official Rosters submitted by the heads of the different CRECOM commands, do not appear in the said official rosters. Besides, the heads of the different CRECOM commands, namely, Supt. Manuel Raval of PNP Abra, Supt. Rolando Garcia of PNP Benguet, C/Insp. Prospero Noble of PNP Ifugao, Supt. Rodrigo F. Licudine of the Regional Mobile Force, Supt. Juan T. Refe of Northern Luzon Training Center, Supt. Conrado R. Peregrino, Jr. of PNP Kalinga-Apayao, and Supt. Amparo Cabigas of the Headquarter Services testified that their respective signatures appearing in the Clothing Requirements and Certifications and in the said <i>PNP Personnel Payrolls </i>are forgeries because the signatures appearing above their typewritten names in said documents are not theirs and that the personnel of their respective commands listed in the Official Rosters submitted by them, never received any CCIE for the year 1992.<br><br>Moreover, a close examination/scrutiny of the signatures of the personnel listed in the said <i>PNP Personnel Payrolls</i>, reveals that the said signatures were signed by one person as shown by the similarity of the style and strokes of the signatures therein which is a clear indication that said payrolls are fabricated and the personnel named therein are fictitious or non-existent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></blockquote><br>Here, Garcia and Luna were the ones who approved the PNP Personnel Payrolls containing the false entries and it was Brizuela who certified that the police personnel listed in the payrolls received their intended CCIE when in fact they did not. Clearly, these are acts of evident bad faith at the least. In submitting fabricated and forged personnel payrolls as supporting and liquidating documents to cover up the illegal release of P20,000,000, petitioners orchestrated a conscious wrongdoing to serve some ulterior motive or self-interest.<br><br>Lastly, the third element of the offense — that the act of the accused caused undue injury to any party, including the Government, or gave any private party unwarranted benefit, advantage or preference in the discharge of the functions of the accused — was also established. Proof of the extent of damage is not essential, it being sufficient that the injury suffered or the benefit received is perceived to be substantial enough and not merely negligible.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>In the present case, the prosecution’s evidence duly proved that petitioners, using their official positions, by dishonesty and breach of sworn duty, facilitated the approval and release of government funds amounting to P20,000,000 supposedly for the purchase of CCIE items of PNP personnel. However, the recipients of the P20,000,000 turned out to be fictitious PNP personnel, and up to now the P20,000,000 remains unaccounted for. Thus, petitioners should be made liable for their deceit and misrepresentation and should compensate the government for the actual damage the government has suffered.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we <b>DENY</b> the petition.
