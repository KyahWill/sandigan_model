(CCBPI) is a manufacturer of soft drink products, employing salesmen and account specialists to sell these products to customers and outlets.<br><br>Petitioner Jonas Michael R. Garza (petitioner) became a regular employee of CCBPI on December 16, 1997, designated as its Salesman in Iriga City.&nbsp; In 2001, he was promoted to the position of Dealer Development Coordinator and assigned at Tabaco City.&nbsp; During his stint therein, he was likewise designated as Acting District Sales Supervisor.<br><br>In 2003, due to changes in CCBPI’s structure and operating systems, the position of Dealer Development Coordinator was abolished, and petitioner was designated as Account Specialist and assigned to the CCBPI Naga City Plant and at Iriga City.&nbsp; For his services, petitioner received a monthly salary of P29,350.00, exclusive of commissions and allowances.&nbsp; Prior to his dismissal from CCBPI, petitioner was an employee of good standing with an unblemished record.<br><br>As Account Specialist, petitioner was tasked mainly with booking customers’ orders and collecting on their accounts;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> petitioner merely books customers’ orders, but does not deliver the product to them; the independent dealer makes the delivery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>&nbsp; In effect, petitioner performed the functions of a CCBPI salesman, except that he operates in concentrated or dense areas.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>As a matter of company policy, CCBPI Account Specialists/Salesmen are obliged to remit all cash sales and credit cash collections to the company office on the same day that payments are received in cash or check from customers, dealers and outlets.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, before allowing the Account Specialists/Salesmen to work the following day, the CCBPI Cashier shall first issue a clearance which is given to the company security guard stating whether they incurred shortages or have not remitted collections.&nbsp; If so, the Account Specialist/Salesman concerned is not allowed to leave the company premises unless his shortages are settled.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>&nbsp; Moreover, shortages are recovered against the monthly salary of the concerned employee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Petitioner received an October 30, 2003 memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> from his immediate supervisor, George C.

Surara (Surara), which concluded that petitioner failed to remit cash and credit collections covering the above accounts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>In his Position Paper,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Supplemental Position Paper,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> and Reply to Respondents’ Rejoinder to Complainant’s Position Paper,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> petitioner claimed essentially that (1) his dismissal was without just cause, and (2) he was denied due process during the proceedings leading to his dismissal.&nbsp; Relative to his claim of dismissal without just cause, petitioner contended that:<br><br>1. The charges against him are false; he was not guilty of embezzlement.&nbsp; All his transactions as Account Specialist are duly accounted for, all cash sales were remitted to CCBPI and all check payments were remitted and credited to CCBPI’s account.&nbsp; Nor did he delay the remittance of these cash and check payments, nor used them in kiting operations for his personal benefit;<br><br>2. With regard to cash collections covering the Henry Botor and Noe Sabularse accounts, CCBPI policies and procedures make it impossible for Salesmen/Account Specialists to commit embezzlement.&nbsp; Each working day, they are required to account for their sales/collections and obtain clearance from the company cashier before they are allowed to leave company premises at the end of their shift and report for work the next day; in case of a shortage, the concerned employee is not allowed to leave the company premises until he settles the shortage.&nbsp; In addition, shortages are deducted against the employee’s salaries.&nbsp; The fact that he continued to report for work up to June 2004 without any adverse action from CCBPI proved that the irregularities attributed to him – which CCBPI claims were committed against his April and May 2003 accounts – were manufactured and untrue;<br><br>3. With respect to the Alice Asanza (Asanza) account, CCBPI’s claim that he failed to remit the customer’s payment is belied by the customer herself, who admitted in her sworn statement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> that during a meeting with CCBPI auditors, she made a mistake in affirming that a delivery of CCBPI products worth P8,160.00 was made on January 30, 2004 and that the same was paid for in cash.&nbsp; She admitted that after consulting her records, delivery of said P8,160.00 worth of CCBPI products was in fact made on October 15, 2003, and that up to now the same remained unpaid.&nbsp; She admitted that she was confused by the CCBPI records which were shown to her, which indicated “Date of Invoice 01-30-04”; thus she mistakenly assumed that a delivery of P8,160.00 worth of CCBPI products was indeed made on such date, and that the same was paid for by her, when in fact no such transaction took place;<br><br>4. Contrary to CCBPI’s claim, all the concerned CCBPI customers, through their submitted affidavits and certifications,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> belied claims that petitioner embezzled their cash or check payments;<br><br>5. He could not have committed “kiting” of CCBPI’s checks, as CCBPI claims, for the simple reason that these checks were made payable to CCBPI specifically, and were not issued in his name.&nbsp; Thus, even for CCBPI products paid for in advance through checks (“payment upon order” or “PUO” accounts), there is no opportunity for embezzlement because the checks are made out to CCBPI;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>6. On the claim of delayed remittances of check payments pertaining to the Leon Trinidad and MCM Fastfood accounts, petitioner claims that although it appears that the checks were issued or dated in the name of CCBPI days earlier, or upon the booking of orders by the petitioner, delivery of its products by the dealer was made days later.&nbsp; Naturally, the checks would only be released by the customers to the petitioner upon/after delivery of products by the dealer; which means that although it would appear that the checks were issued/dated by customers earlier – upon the booking of the customers’ orders – they were delivered/handed over to petitioner only upon/after completion of delivery, which come days after the checks were issued/dated.&nbsp; CCBPI operates through private independent dealers over whom/which petitioner has no control, which means that after petitioner books an order, prompt delivery by the dealer is not guaranteed, and actual delivery could be made days later;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>7. With regard to transactions with Kathryn Serrano (Serrano) of New Ongto Supermart, what CCBPI claims was a different transaction covering an alleged unremitted amount of P10,645.00 was already paid for by Serrano in check issued to CCBPI, and the amount has been debited from her account.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; CCBPI made a mistake in its records, which showed that Serrano paid by check for her order of CCBPI products worth P10,645.00, but which account was recorded by it as a different sale transaction of P10,615.00.&nbsp; These two transactions are but one and the same; in fact, CCBPI itself claims in its Rejoinder to Complainant’s Position Paper that Serrano’s check for P10,645.00 was used to pay the P10,615.00 transaction, which only proves that the P10,615.00 transaction was an erroneous entry;<br><br>8. With respect to the Marlene Yu, Beatriz Orolfo, Ofelia Ong, and Ceguera Bakeshop accounts, their own sworn statements and certifications will show that all their check payments were issued in the name of CCBPI, not the petitioner.&nbsp; And all the amounts covered by these checks have been duly debited from their accounts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>In conclusion, petitioner argued that the evidence showed that he did not commit the alleged embezzlement; that CCBPI failed to prove just cause for his dismissal; and that the charges against him were contrived and the evidence self-serving.<br><br>As for his contention that he was denied due process during the proceedings leading to his dismissal, petitioner claimed that he was not provided ample opportunity to be heard.&nbsp; The April 23, 2004 written charge against him did not specify the particular transactions and acts which formed the basis for the accusations against him, for which reason he was unable to prepare the required written explanation.&nbsp; He verbally informed Macatangay of this predicament, but instead of acceding to his lawful request, the latter issued the April 26, 2004 memorandum which was identical to that issued on April 23.&nbsp; Petitioner argued that he could not be considered to have ignored the written charge against him.&nbsp; Nor may it be said that he waived his right to an investigation, as the evidence showed that he sought a rescheduling of the May 11, 2004 hearing for valid reasons – his wife had just given birth; he had to attend to her and their newborn child, as well as take care of their financial obligations to the hospital.&nbsp; CCBPI’s failure and refusal to grant a postponement of the investigation was thus unreasonable and violative of his rights.<br><br>Petitioner added that he waited in vain for CCBPI to furnish him the proper detailed charges and accusations against him; instead, CCBPI issued the June 14, 2004 Notice of Termination.&nbsp; And immediately after receiving the said notice, he was called by ASM Peniera to his office where he was ostensibly told that he could have access to company records in order to reconcile his accounts, but which never materialized as thereafter he was in fact prohibited from entering the company premises and denied access to the records.<br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Labor Arbiter</i></b><br><br>On March 28, 2005, the Labor Arbiter issued a Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> the decretal portion of which states:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, finding merit on [sic] the causes of action set forth by the complainant, judgment is hereby rendered declaring his termination or dismissal from employment by the respondents as ILLEGAL and thereby ORDERING x x x the following:<br><br>A.

To pay backwages, inclusive of allowances and other benefits or his [sic] monetary equivalent, computed from the date of his respective dismissal up to the time of his actual reinstatement, whether physically or on payroll, which as of the date of this decision amounted to P282,625.00 computed from June 14, 2004 to this date of decision, at the rate of P29,750.00 per month.<br><br>[C.] To pay Attorney’s Fees corresponding to 10% of the total amount of P282,625.00 due to the complainant which is equivalent to the sum of P28,262.50.<br><br>Other than the above, all other claims are hereby ordered DISMISSED for lack of merit.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The Labor Arbiter held that CCBPI failed to adduce in evidence the particular provision in the CCBPI Employee’s Code of Disciplinary Rules and Regulations which forms the basis of its accusations against petitioner.&nbsp; He added that the accusation that petitioner embezzled company funds totaling P105,653.00 was couched in general terms; the particulars thereof were not stated with sufficient clarity.&nbsp; Moreover, the alleged violations were not clearly made known to petitioner, such that he could not properly refute them.&nbsp; And instead of allowing a postponement of the investigation as requested by petitioner, he was summarily dismissed.<br><br>The Labor Arbiter further held that CCBPI violated the notice and hearing requirements, in serving upon petitioner a first notice which failed to correctly and fully inform him of the charges against him; for unreasonably denying him an opportunity to be heard during the investigation; and for issuing a second notice of termination that did not contain clear and sufficient reasons for his dismissal.<br><br>The Labor Arbiter however denied petitioner’s prayer for moral and exemplary damages, stating that CCBPI and its co-respondents do not appear to be guilty of bad faith, malice or fraud, nor did they act in a manner contrary to morals, good customs or public policy.&nbsp; However, petitioner was awarded attorney’s fees, as he was compelled to litigate and thus secure the services of counsel to protect his interest.<br><br><b><i>Ruling of the National Labor Relations Commission</i></b><br><br>Respondents appealed to the NLRC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>&nbsp; Meanwhile, in May 2005, while the NLRC appeal was pending, petitioner was reinstated pursuant to Art. 223 of the Labor Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>&nbsp; He was designated as Route Salesman, and was assigned tasks relative to booking and delivery of CCBPI products, and collection of accounts.&nbsp; In fact, he was awarded a Certificate of Achievement for exemplary sales performance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>On July 31, 2006, the NLRC issued its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> which decreed as follows:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, as modified, respondents-appellants are ordered to pay complainant-appellee Jonas Michael R.

Garza the amount of P30,000.00 as nominal damages for non-compliance with statutory due process.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></blockquote><br>The CA ruled that petitioner’s dismissal was proper.&nbsp; It paid particular attention to the Asanza account, saying that CCBPI’s evidence showed that petitioner was guilty of non-remittance of Asanza’s P8,160.00 cash payment which appears to have been made on January 30, 2004 on an October 15, 2003 delivery.&nbsp; The payment is evidenced by Official Receipt No. 303203<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> issued by petitioner to Asanza on January 30, 2004, and a January 31, 2004 Route Header Form<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> where petitioner specifically indicated that Asanza no longer had payables to CCBPI.&nbsp; The CA held that from this, CCBPI was able to prove that petitioner was guilty of non-remittance of the P8,160.00 collected from Asanza.<br><br>With regard to the manner in which petitioner was dismissed, the CA conceded that the procedure observed by CCBPI was defective, but since the dismissal was for just cause, the lack of due process did not nullify the dismissal, but merely entitled petitioner to an award of nominal damages.<br><br>Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration, but in the second assailed November 16, 2007 Resolution, the CA denied the same.<br><br><center><b>Issues</b></center><br>In this Petition,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> the following issues are raised:<br><br><blockquote>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS SERIOUSLY ERRED IN REVERSING THE DECISION OF THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION DESPITE CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT PETITIONER WAS ILLEGALLY DISMISSED;<br><br>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS SERIOUSLY ERRED IN NOT MODIFYING THE DECISION OF THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION WITH [REGARD] TO THE ORDER OF THE HONORABLE COMMISSION FOR PAYMENT OF SEPARATION PAY IN LIEU OF REINSTATEMENT;<br><br>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED WHEN IT FAILED TO AWARD DAMAGES AND ATTORNEY’S FEES TO THE PETITIONER.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></blockquote><br><b><i>Petitioner’s Arguments</i></b><br><br>Petitioner prays for the reinstatement of the Labor&nbsp;

He insists that CCBPI’s evidence consisting of the affidavit of its Territory Finance Head, Surara, is self-serving and without basis.&nbsp; Petitioner directs the Court’s attention to the fact that company policies make it impossible for him to embezzle cash and check payments made to him by CCBPI customers, and his evidence consisting of customers’ affidavits and certifications prove that all payments are made in the name of and for the account of CCBPI.<br><br>With regard to the Asanza account, petitioner claims that the CA erred in finding him guilty of failure to remit the P8,160.00 cash payment made by Asanza, contending that Asanza herself admitted under oath that no payment has in fact been made; that his issuance of Official Receipt No. 303203 was conditioned on Asanza issuing a postdated check later on, which she failed to do; that Asanza’s account, as indicated in the receipts and invoices, is precisely an RCS account, or “Regular Charge Sale”, which means that deliveries to her are on a credit – not cash – basis; that the January 31, 2004 Route Header Form which indicated that Asanza no longer had payables to CCBPI refers to deliveries made specifically on January 30, 2004, and did not include or refer to the October 15, 2003 transaction, which to date remains unpaid.<br><br>Finally, petitioner contends that he should be reinstated to his former position, and awarded moral and exemplary damages, as well as attorney’s fees.<br><br><b><i>Respondents’ Arguments</i></b><br><br>Respondents, apart from echoing the pronouncements of the CA, flatly submit that the Petition involves purely questions of fact revolving around CCBPI customers, who confirmed in their affidavits<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> that their cash payments were not remitted by petitioner to CCBPI.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b></center><br>The Court grants the Petition.<br><br>There is no issue on the manner by which petitioner was dismissed.&nbsp; Since respondents did not appeal the unanimous findings of the Labor Arbiter, NLRC and the CA in this regard, their pronouncements on the issue are deemed final and executory.&nbsp; The only issue that needs to be resolved, therefore, is whether there is just cause for petitioner’s dismissal.<br><br>The sole basis for the CA’s ruling that petitioner was validly dismissed is that he failed to remit a cash collection of P8,160.00 from one of its customers, Asanza.&nbsp; What seems to have escaped the appellate court’s notice is that in order to be able to come to such a conclusion, an important issue concerning CCBPI policies and procedures must first be tackled.<br><br>One of CCBPI’s policies requires that, on a daily basis, CCBPI Salesmen/ Account Specialists must account for their sales/collections and obtain clearance from the company Cashier before they are allowed to leave company premises at the end of their shift and report for work the next day.&nbsp; If there is a shortage/failure to account, the concerned Salesmen/Account Specialist is not allowed to leave the company premises until he settles the same.&nbsp; In addition, shortages are deducted from the employee’s salaries.&nbsp; Petitioner made repeated reiterations of this company policy all throughout the proceedings, and not once did respondents deny or dispute its existence and implementation.&nbsp; In fact, respondents confirmed existence of this policy when they stated in their Position Paper,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> that “[a]s a matter of policy, salesmen in respondent’s company are obliged to remit all cash sales and credit cash collections to the company office on the same day that said payments are made by various customers, dealers and outlets.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>It is altogether reasonable to suppose that this policy actually exists, because undeniably, such policy insured a fool-proof system of accountability within CCBPI, where shortages are immediately detected, presumably through the reconciliation of daily orders and deliveries to customers with the daily collections of CCBPI’s salesmen, and simultaneously accounted for.&nbsp; With such a policy, no transaction is left unnoticed, and erring salesmen are instantaneously made to account for their shortages before they can even leave the premises and come back to work the following day.<br><br>Within the context of said policy, it can be said that since petitioner continued to work for CCBPI until June 2004, this should necessarily mean that he was clear of daily cash and check accountabilities, including those transactions covered by the charges against him.&nbsp; If not, the company cashier would not have issued the required clearance and petitioner would have been required to settle these shortages as soon as they were incurred.&nbsp; Indeed, he would not have been allowed to leave company premises until they were settled in accordance with company policy.&nbsp; And he would not have been allowed to report for work the following day.<br><br>“Where facts are in evidence affording legitimate inferences going to establish the ultimate fact that the evidence is designed to prove, and the party to be affected by the proof, with an opportunity to do so, fails to deny or explain them, they may well be taken as admitted with all the effect of the inferences afforded.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup>&nbsp; If CCBPI expects to proceed with its case against petitioner, it should have negated this policy, for its existence and application are inextricably tied to CCBPI’s accusations against petitioner.&nbsp; In the first place, as petitioner’s employer, upon it lay the burden of proving by convincing evidence that he was dismissed for cause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>&nbsp; If petitioner continued to work until June 2004, this meant that he committed no infraction, going by this company policy; it could also mean that any infraction or shortage/non-remittance incurred by petitioner has been duly settled.&nbsp; Respondents’ decision to ignore this issue generates the belief that petitioner is telling the truth, and that the alleged infractions are fabricated, or have been forgiven.&nbsp; Coupled with Macatangay’s statement – which remains equally unrefuted – that the charges against petitioner are a scheme by local CCBPI management to cover up problems in the Naga City Plant, the conclusion is indeed telling that petitioner is being wrongfully made to account.<br><br>The irregularity attributed to petitioner with regard to the Asanza account should fail as well.&nbsp; To be sure, Asanza herself confirmed that she did not make any payment in cash or check of P8,160.00 covering the October 15, 2003 delivery for which petitioner is being held to account.&nbsp; This being the case, petitioner could not be charged with embezzlement/failure to remit for the simple reason that as regards such October 15, 2003 delivery, <b>there was nothing to embezzle or remit because no payment thereon has as yet been made by the customer Asanza</b>.&nbsp; It may appear from Official Receipt No. 303203 issued to Asanza that the October 15 delivery of products to her has been paid; but as admitted by her, she has not paid for the said delivered products.&nbsp; The reason for petitioner’s issuance of said official receipt to Asanza is the latter’s concurrent promise that she would immediately issue the check covering the said amount, which she nevertheless failed to do.<br><br>Although petitioner may be faulted for this act – issuing an official receipt without receiving the corresponding payment – he could not be accused of embezzlement or failure to remit as defined and punished under CCBPI’s November 18, 2002 Inter-Office Memorandum, because he received no cash or check from Asanza.&nbsp; Without receiving anything from her, there was nothing for petitioner to embezzle or remit, and thus CCBPI had no basis to charge him for violation of the November 18, 2002 Inter-Office Memorandum which punished embezzlement and failure/delay in remitting collections.<br><br>The Court likewise finds convincing petitioner’s arguments that it was impossible for him to embezzle/not remit the other customers’ cash and check payments, not only because of the existence of the abovementioned policy, but likewise due to the sworn avowals of these customers that all their check payments have been issued in CCBPI’s name and have been duly debited from their accounts.&nbsp; Certainly, petitioner could not have encashed check payments because they were issued in the name of CCBPI; for the same reason, he could not have engaged in kiting operations.&nbsp; Quite certainly, he would have easily been found out.<br><br>Regarding the claim that petitioner delayed the remittance of check payments covering PUO accounts, the Court finds petitioner’s explanation to be satisfactory.&nbsp; Suffice it to state that in selling its products, CCBPI, like other manufacturers, operates through independent dealer-businessmen, whose delivery schedules are beyond CCBPI’s control.&nbsp; Thus, if a CCBPI salesman places a customer’s order with the independent dealer, this does not mean that the latter would immediately deliver the product; it could do so later.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the customer would write and date his/her check to coincide with the date of the order, expecting that delivery would be made the very same day.&nbsp; But actual delivery could be made days later; naturally, the customer would release the check – which is dated days earlier – to the CCBPI salesmen (including petitioner) only after the delivery is completed.&nbsp; As correctly argued by petitioner, this constitutes a cogent explanation for his apparent late remittance of PUO or “date of order=date of check” checks.<br><br>In a bid to further pin down petitioner, respondents rely heavily on CCBPI customers’ affidavits<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> which state that their cash payments were not remitted by petitioner to CCBPI.&nbsp; How these customers came to the knowledge and conclusion that petitioner did not remit their cash payments to CCBPI is beyond the Court.&nbsp; If there should be actual knowledge of petitioner’s embezzlement, it could only come from respondents; it is not for the CCBPI customers to prove, for the benefit of respondents, that petitioner embezzled their cash payments.&nbsp; They have gained no knowledge superior to that of respondents regarding this fact, and offhand are not adequately equipped with the means to come to such a conclusion.&nbsp; Thus, for respondents to even present their sworn statements to such effect is truly beyond comprehension.<br><br>As earlier stated, the burden is on the employer to prove that the termination was for valid cause.&nbsp; Unsubstantiated accusations or baseless conclusions of the employer are insufficient legal justifications to dismiss an employee.&nbsp; “The unflinching rule in illegal dismissal cases is that the employer bears the burden of proof.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>It may also be said that CCBPI’s subsequent award of a Certificate of Achievement to petitioner for his exemplary sales performance, while the NLRC appeal was pending, constitutes recognition of petitioner’s abilities and accomplishments in CCBPI.&nbsp; It indicates that he is a responsible, trustworthy and hardworking employee of CCBPI.&nbsp; It constitutes adequate proof weighing in his favor.<br><br>Having thus seen that petitioner is innocent of the charges leveled against him, the Court must order his reinstatement.&nbsp; As a matter of course, the NLRC and CA pronouncements inconsistent with this declaration are necessarily rendered null and void.&nbsp; However, no moral and exemplary damages are forthcoming.&nbsp; Petitioner’s failure to appeal the Labor Arbiter’s ruling denying his claims for these damages rendered such pronouncement final and executory; he may no longer obtain a modification or reversal of the Decision on the issue.&nbsp; A party who did not appeal from the decision cannot seek any relief other than what is provided in the judgment appealed from.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>Finally, consistent with the Court’s pronouncement in <i>Nacar v. Gallery Frames</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> the awards herein are subject to interest at the rate of <i>six percent</i> (6%) <i>per annum</i>, to be computed from the finality of the Decision in this case until the total award is fully paid.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the Petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.&nbsp; The September 26, 2007 Decision and November 16, 2007 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
