This case resulted in the rescue of two minors from this pernicious practice. Hopefully, there will be more rescues. Trafficking in persons is a deplorable crime. It is committed even though the minor knew about or consented to the act of trafficking.<br><br>This case involves Republic Act No. 9208,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> otherwise known as the “Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Accused Shirley A. Casio was charged for the violation of Republic Act No. 9208, Section 4(a), qualified by Section 6(a). The information against accused, dated May 5, 2008, states:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 3<sup>rd</sup> day of May 2008, at about 1:00 o’clock A.M., in the City of Cebu, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, with deliberate intent, with intent to gain, did then and there hire and/or recruit AAA, a minor, 17 years old and BBB for the purpose of prostitution and sexual exploitation, by acting as their procurer for different customers, for money, profit or any other consideration, in Violation of Sec. 4, Par. (a), Qualified by Sec. 6, Par. ( a), of R.A. 9208 (Qualified Trafficking in Persons).<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></blockquote>The facts, as found by the trial court and the Court of Appeals, are as follows:<br><br>On May 2, 2008, International Justice Mission (IJM),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> a non-governmental organization, coordinated with the police in order to entrap persons engaged in human trafficking in Cebu City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Chief PSI George Ylanan, SPO1 Felomino Mendaros, SPO1 Fe Altubar, PO1 Albert Luardo, and PO1 Roy Carlo Veloso composed the team of police operatives.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> PO1 Luardo and PO1 Veloso were designated as decoys, pretending to be tour guides looking for girls to entertain their guests.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> IJM provided them with marked money, which was recorded in the police blotter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The team went to Queensland Motel and rented Rooms 24 and 25. These rooms were adjacent to each other. Room 24 was designated for the transaction while Room 25 was for the rest of the police team.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>PO1 Luardo and PO1 Veloso proceeded to D. Jakosalem Street in Barangay Kamagayan, Cebu City’s red light district. Accused noticed them and called their attention by saying “<i>Chicks mo dong</i>?” (Do you like girls, guys?).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>During trial, PO1 Luardo and PO1 Veloso testified that their conversation with accused went as follows:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td width="10%">Accused: </td><td width="90%">Chicks mo dong? (Do you like girls, guys?)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">PO1 Luardo: </td><td>Unya mga bag-o? Kanang batan-on kay naa mi guests naghulat sa motel. (Are they new?

PO1 Luardo inquired how much their services would cost. Accused replied, “<i>Tag kinientos</i>” (P500.00).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>PO1 Veloso and PO1 Luardo convinced accused to come with them to Queensland Motel. Upon proceeding to Room 24, PO1 Veloso handed the marked money to accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>As accused counted the money, PO1 Veloso gave PSI Ylanan a missed call. This was their pre-arranged signal. The rest of the team proceeded to Room 24, arrested accused, and informed her of her constitutional rights. The police confiscated the marked money from accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Meanwhile, AAA and BBB “were brought to Room 25 and placed in the custody of the representatives from the IJM and the DSWD.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>During trial, AAA testified that she was born on January 27, 1991. This statement was supported by a copy of her certificate of live birth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>AAA narrated that in 2007, she worked as a house helper in Mandaue City. In March 2008 she stopped working as a house helper and transferred to Cebu City. She stayed with her cousin, but she subsequently moved to a boarding house. It was there where she met her friend, Gee Ann. AAA knew that Gee Ann worked in a disco club. When Gee Ann found out that AAA was no longer a virgin, she offered AAA work. AAA agreed because she needed the money in order to help her father. AAA recalled that she had sex with her first customer. She was paid P200.00 and given an additional P500.00 as tip. For the first few weeks, Gee Ann provided customers for AAA. Eventually, Gee Ann brought her to Barangay Kamagayan, telling her that there were more customers in that area.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>AAA stated that she knew accused was a pimp because AAA would usually see her pimping girls to customers in Barangay Kamagayan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> AAA further testified that on May 2, 2008, accused solicited her services for a customer. That was the first time that she was pimped by accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Accused brought her, BBB, and a certain Jocelyn to Queensland Motel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>AAA testified that Jocelyn stayed in the taxi, while she and BBB went to Room 24. It was in Room 24 where the customer paid Shirley. The police rushed in and told AAA and BBB to go to the other room. AAA was then met by the Department of Social Welfare and Development personnel who informed her that she was rescued and not arrested.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>AAA described that her job as a prostitute required her to display herself, along with other girls, between 7 p.m. to 8 p.m. She received P400.00 for every customer who selected her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>The prosecution also presented the police operatives during trial. PSI Ylanan, SPO1 Mendaros, and SPO1 Altubar testified that after PO1 Veloso had made the missed call to PSI Ylanan, they “rushed to Room 24 and arrested the accused.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> SPO1 Altubar retrieved the marked money worth P1,000.00 from accused’s right hand “and upon instruction from PCINSP Ylanan recorded the same at the ‘police blotter prior operation’. . . .”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>The trial court noted that AAA requested assistance from the IJM “in conducting the operation against the accused.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br><b>Version of the accused</b><br><br>In defense, accused testified that she worked as a laundrywoman. On the evening of May 2, 2008, she went out to buy supper. While walking, she was stopped by two men on board a blue car. The two men asked her if she knew someone named Bingbing. She replied that she only knew Gingging but not Bingbing. The men informed her that they were actually looking for Gingging, gave her a piece of paper with a number written on it, and told her to tell Gingging to bring companions. When accused arrived home, she contacted Gingging. Gingging convinced her to come because allegedly, she would be given money by the two males.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br><b>Ruling of the trial court</b><br><br>The Regional Trial Court, Branch 14 in Cebu City found accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt and held<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> that:<br><blockquote>Accused had consummated the act of trafficking of person[s] . . . as defined under paragraph (a), Section 3 of R.A. 9208 for the purpose of letting her engage in prostitution as defined under paragraph [c] of the same Section; the act of “sexual intercourse” need not have been consummated for the mere “transaction” i.e. the ‘solicitation’ for sex and the handing over of the “bust money” of Php1,000.00 already consummated the said act.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>WHEREFORE, the Court finds accused, SHIRLEY A.

The UN CTOC is supplemented by three protocols: (1) the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children; (2) the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air; and, (3) the Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, their Parts and Components and Ammunition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>On December 14, 2000, the Philippines signed the United Nations “Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children” (Trafficking Protocol).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> This was ratified by the Philippine Senate on September 30, 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> The Trafficking Protocol’s entry into force was on December 25, 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>In the Trafficking Protocol, human trafficking is defined as:<br><blockquote><b>Article 3</b><br><br><b>Use of terms</b><br><br>For the purposes of this Protocol:<br><br>(a) “Trafficking in persons” shall mean the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation.

It is a manifestation of one of the most flagrant forms of violence against human beings. Its victims suffer the brunt of this insidious form of violence. It is exploitation, coercion, deception, abduction, rape, physical, mental and other forms of abuse, prostitution, forced labor, and indentured servitude.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>As of this time, we have signed the following: the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women; the 1995 Convention on the Rights of the Child; the United Nations Convention on the Protection of Migrant Workers and their Families; and the United Nations’ Resolution on Trafficking in Women and Girls, among others.<br><br>Moreover, we have also expressed our support for the United Nations’ Convention Against Organized Crime, including the Trafficking Protocol in October last year.<br><br>At first glance, it appears that we are very responsive to the problem.

These laws address issues such as illegal recruitment, prostitution, falsification of public documents and the mail-order bride scheme. <i>These laws do not respond to the issue of recruiting, harboring or transporting persons resulting in prostitution, forced labor, slavery and slavery-like practices. They only address to one or some elements of trafficking independent of their results or consequence.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Thus, Republic Act No. 9208 was enacted in order to fully address the issue of human trafficking.

Accused was charged under Section 4(a), which states:<br><blockquote>SEC. 4. <i>Acts of Trafficking in Persons</i>. — It shall be unlawful for any person, natural or judicial, to commit any of the following acts.<br><br>a.&nbsp; To recruit, transport, transfer, harbor, provide, or receive a person by any means, including those done under the pretext of domestic or overseas employment or training or apprenticeship, for the purpose of prostitution, pornography, sexual exploitation, forced labor, slavery, involuntary servitude or debt bondage;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br></blockquote>Republic Act No. 9208 further enumerates the instances when the crime of trafficking in persons is qualified.<br><blockquote>SEC. 6. <i>Qualified Trafficking in Persons</i>. — The following are considered as qualified trafficking:<br><ol type="a"><li><i>When the trafficked person is a child</i>;<br><br></li><li>When the adoption is effected through Republic Act No. 8043, otherwise known as the “Inter-Country Adoption Act of 1995” and said adoption is for the purpose of prostitution, pornography, sexual exploitation, forced labor, slavery, involuntary servitude or debt bondage;<br><br></li><li>When the crime is committed by a syndicate, or in large scale.

The offense was also qualified because the trafficked persons were minors.<br><br>Here, AAA testified as to how accused solicited her services for the customers waiting at Queensland Motel. AAA also testified that she was only 17 years old when accused peddled her. Her certificate of live birth was presented as evidence to show that she was born on January 27, 1991.<br><br>The prosecution was able to prove beyond reasonable doubt that accused committed the offense of trafficking in persons, qualified by the fact that one of the victims was a child. As held by the trial court:<br><blockquote>[T]he act of “sexual intercourse” need not have been consummated for the mere “transaction” i.e. that ‘solicitation’ for sex and the handing over of the “bust money” of Php.1,000.00 already consummated the said act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>IV.</b><br></div><br><b>Validity of the entrapment operation </b><br><br>In <i>People v. Doria</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> this court discussed the objective test and the subjective test to determine whether there was a valid entrapment operation:<br><blockquote>. . . American federal courts and a majority of state courts use the “subjective” or “origin of intent” test laid down in <i>Sorrells v. United States</i> to determine whether entrapment actually occurred. <i>The focus of the inquiry is on the accused's predisposition to commit the offense charged, his state of mind and inclination before his initial exposure to government agents</i>. All relevant facts such as the accused's mental and character traits, his past offenses, activities, his eagerness in committing the crime, his reputation, etc., are considered to assess his state of mind before the crime. The predisposition test emphasizes the accused's propensity to commit the offense rather than the officer's misconduct and reflects an attempt to draw a line between a “trap for the unwary innocent and the trap for the unwary criminal.” If the accused was found to have been ready and willing to commit the offense at any favorable opportunity, the entrapment defense will fail even if a police agent used an unduly persuasive inducement.<br><br>Some states, however, have adopted the “objective” test. . . . Here, the court considers the nature of the police activity involved and the propriety of police conduct. <i>The inquiry is focused on the inducements used by government agents, on police conduct, not on the accused and his predisposition to commit the crime</i>. For the goal of the defense is to deter unlawful police conduct. The test of entrapment is whether the conduct of the law enforcement agent was likely to induce a normally law-abiding person, other than one who is ready and willing, to commit the offense; for purposes of this test, it is presumed that a law-abiding person would normally resist the temptation to commit a crime that is presented by the simple opportunity to act unlawfully. (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br></blockquote>Accused argued that in our jurisprudence, courts usually apply the objective test in determining the whether there was an entrapment operation or an instigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> However, the use of the objective test should not preclude courts from also applying the subjective test. She pointed out that:<br><blockquote>Applying the “<b><i>subjective</i></b>” test it is worth invoking that accused-appellant procures income from being a laundry woman. The prosecution had not shown any proof evidencing accused-appellant’s history in human trafficking or engagement in any offense. She is not even familiar to the team who had has [sic] been apprehending human traffickers for quite some time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Accused further argued that the police should have conducted a prior surveillance before the entrapment operation.<br><br>Time and again, this court has discussed the difference between entrapment and instigation. In <i>Chang v. People</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> this court explained that:<br><blockquote>There is entrapment when law officers employ ruses and schemes to ensure the apprehension of the criminal while in the actual commission of the crime. There is instigation when the accused is induced to commit the crime. The difference in the nature of the two lies in the origin of the criminal intent. In entrapment, the <i>mens rea</i> originates from the mind of the criminal. The idea and the resolve to commit the crime comes from him. In instigation, the law officer conceives the commission of the crime and suggests to the accused who adopts the idea and carries it into execution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br></blockquote>Accused contends that using the subjective test, she was clearly instigated by the police to commit the offense. She denied being a pimp and claimed that she earned her living as a laundrywoman. On this argument, we agree with the finding of the Court of Appeals:<br><blockquote>[I]t was the accused-appellant who commenced the transaction with PO1 Luardo and PO1 Veloso by calling their attention on whether they wanted girls for that evening, and when the officers responded, it was the accused-appellant who told them to wait while she would fetch the girls for their perusal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br></blockquote>This shows that accused was predisposed to commit the offense because she initiated the transaction. As testified by PO1 Veloso and PO1 Luardo, accused called out their attention by saying “<i>Chicks mo dong</i>?” If accused had no predisposition to commit the offense, then she most likely would not have asked PO1 Veloso and PO1 Luardo if they wanted girls.<br><br>The entrapment would still be valid using the objective test. The police merely proceeded to D. Jakosalem Street in Barangay Kamagayan. It was accused who asked them whether they wanted girls. There was no illicit inducement on the part of the police for the accused to commit the crime.<br><br>When accused was arrested, she was informed of her constitutional rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> The marked money retrieved from her was recorded in the police blotter prior to the entrapment operation and was presented in court as evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>On accused’s alibi that she was merely out to buy her supper that night, the Court of Appeals noted that accused never presented Gingging in court. Thus, her alibi was unsubstantiated and cannot be given credence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br><br>With regard to the lack of prior surveillance, prior surveillance is not a condition for an entrapment operation’s validity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> In <i>People v. Padua</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> this court underscored the value of flexibility in police operations:<br><blockquote>A prior surveillance is not a prerequisite for the validity of an entrapment or buy-bust operation, the conduct of which has no rigid or textbook method. Flexibility is a trait of good police work. However the police carry out its entrapment operations, for as long as the rights of the accused have not been violated in the process, the courts will not pass on the wisdom thereof. The police officers may decide that time is of the essence and dispense with the need for prior surveillance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>This flexibility is even more important in cases involving trafficking of persons. The urgency of rescuing the victims may at times require immediate but deliberate action on the part of the law enforcers.<br><br><center><b>V.</b><br></center><b><br>Imposition of fine and award of damages</b><br><br>The Court of Appeals properly imposed the amount of P2,000,000.00. Section 10 (b) of Republic Act No. 9208 provides that:<br><blockquote>SEC. 10. <i>Penalties and Sanctions</i>. — The following penalties and sanctions are hereby established for the offenses enumerated in this Act:<br><br>. . . .&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">c. </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">Any person found guilty of qualified trafficking under Section 6 shall suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of not less than Two million pesos (P2,000,000.00) but not more than Five million pesos (P5,000,000.00);</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>However, we modify by raising the award of moral damages from P150,000.00<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> to P500,000.00. We also award exemplary damages in the amount of P100,000.00. These amounts are in accordance with the ruling in <i>People v. Lalli</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> where this court held that:<br><blockquote>The payment of P500,000 as moral damages and P100,000 as exemplary damages for the crime of Trafficking in Persons as a Prostitute finds basis in Article 2219 of the Civil Code, which states:<br><blockquote>Art. 2219. Moral damages may be recovered in the following and analogous cases:<br><br>(1) A criminal offense resulting in physical injuries;<br><br>(2) Quasi-delicts causing physical injuries;<br><br>(3) Seduction, abduction, rape, or other lascivious acts;<br><br>(4) Adultery or concubinage;<br><br>(5) Illegal or arbitrary detention or arrest;<br><br>(6) Illegal search;<br><br>(7) Libel, slander or any other form of defamation;<br><br>(8) Malicious prosecution;<br><br>(9) Acts mentioned in Article 309;<br><br>(10) Acts and actions referred to in Articles 21, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, 34, and 35.<br><br>. . . .<br></blockquote>The criminal case of Trafficking in Persons as a Prostitute is an analogous case to the crimes of seduction, abduction, rape, or other lascivious acts. In fact, it is worse. To be trafficked as a prostitute without one’s consent and to be sexually violated four to five times a day by different strangers is horrendous and atrocious. There is no doubt that Lolita experienced physical suffering, mental anguish, fright, serious anxiety, besmirched reputation, wounded feelings, moral shock, and social humiliation when she was trafficked as a prostitute in Malaysia. Since the crime of Trafficking in Persons was aggravated, being committed by a syndicate, the award of exemplary damages is likewise justified.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><br></blockquote>Human trafficking indicts the society that tolerates the kind of poverty and its accompanying desperation that compels our women to endure indignities. It reflects the weaknesses of that society even as it convicts those who deviantly thrive in such hopelessness. We should continue to strive for the best of our world, where our choices of human intimacies are real choices, and not the last resort taken just to survive. Human intimacies enhance our best and closest relationships. It serves as a foundation for two human beings to face life’s joys and challenges while continually growing together with many shared experiences. The quality of our human relationships defines the world that we create also for others.<br><br>Regardless of the willingness of AAA and BBB, therefore, to be trafficked, we affirm the text and spirit of our laws. Minors should spend their adolescence moulding their character in environments free of the vilest motives and the worse of other human beings. The evidence and the law compel us to affirm the conviction of accused in this case.<br><br>But this is not all that we have done. By fulfilling our duties, we also express the hope that our people and our government unite against everything inhuman. We contribute to a commitment to finally stamp out slavery and human trafficking.<br><br>There are more AAA’s and BBBs out there. They, too, deserve to be rescued.
