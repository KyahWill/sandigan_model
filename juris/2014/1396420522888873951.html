It is principally engaged in the business of power generation and subsequent sale thereof to the National Power Corporation (NPC), Cebu Electric Cooperative III (CEBECO), Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Corporation, Atlas Fertilizer Corporation and Cebu Industrial Park Development, Inc., and is registered with the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) as a Value Added Tax taxpayer in accordance with Section 236 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) with Tax Identification No. 003-883-626-VAT and BIR Certificate of Registration bearing RDO Control No. 94-083-000300.<br><br>On June 20, 2002, petitioner filed an application with the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) for the issuance of a Certificate of Compliance pursuant to the Implementing Rules and Regulations of R.A. 9136, otherwise known as the “Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2007” (EPIRA).<br><br>On October 25, 2001, petitioner filed with the BIR Revenue District Office (RDO) No. 83 at Toledo City, Province of Cebu, its Quarterly VAT Return for the third quarter of 2001, declaring among others, the following:<br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="50%"> <tbody><tr> <td width="51%">Zero-rated Sales/Receipts</td> <td width="49%"><div align="RIGHT">P 143,000,032.37</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Taxable Sales-Sale of Scrap/Others</td> <td><div align="RIGHT">378,651.74</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Output Tax</td> <td><div align="RIGHT">34,422.89</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Less: Input Tax</td> <td><div align="RIGHT"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><blockquote> <p>On Domestic Purchases</p> </blockquote></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">4,765,458.58</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><blockquote> <p>On Importation of Goods</p> </blockquote></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">1,242,792.00</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Total Available Input Tax</td> <td><div align="RIGHT"><u>6,008,250.58</u></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Excess Input Tax &amp; Overpayment</td> <td><div align="RIGHT"><u>P 5,973,827.69</u></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><br>However, an amended Quarterly VAT Return for the same quarter of 2001 was filed on November 22, 2001.

On October 24, 2003, petitioner filed a Petition for Review for the refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate in the amount of P5,909,588.96 for the third quarter of 2001, docketed as CTA Case No. 6805 and, on January 22, 2004, filed another Petition for Review for the refund or issuance of tax credit certificate in the amount of P3,219,781.31 for the fourth quarter of 2001, docketed as CTA Case No. 6851, both for its unutilized input VAT paid by petitioner on its domestic purchases of goods and services and importation of goods attributable to zero-rated sales.<br><br>On January 30, 2004, petitioner filed a Motion for Consolidation CTA Case Nos. 6805 and 6851, since these cases involve the same parties, same facts and issues.

However, the same was denied in a Resolution dated October 15, 2007.<br><br>On appeal to the CTA <i>En Banc</i>, the CIR argued that TPI failed to comply with the invoicing requirements to prove entitlement to the refund or issuance of tax credit certificate. In addition, he challenged the jurisdiction of the CTA First Division to entertain respondent’s petition for review for failure on its part to comply with the provisions of Section 112 (C) of the Tax Code.<br><br>In a Decision dated May 7, 2008, the CTA En Banc affirmed with modification the First Division’s assailed decision.

From the date of submission of complete documents in support of its application, the CIR has 120 days to decide whether or not to grant the claim for refund or issuance of tax credit certificate. In case of full or partial denial of the claim for tax refund or tax credit, or the failure on the part of the CIR to act on the application within the given period, the taxpayer may, within 30 days from receipt of the decision denying the claim or after the expiration of the 120-day period, appeal with the CTA the decision or inaction of the CIR.<br><br>Recently, in the consolidated cases of <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. San Roque Power Corporation</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> (San Roque), the Court confirmed the mandatory and jurisdictional nature of the 120+30 day rule.&nbsp; It ratiocinated as follows:<br><br><blockquote>At the time San Roque filed its petition for review with the CTA, the 120+30 day mandatory periods were already in the law. Section 112 (C) expressly grants the Commissioner 120 days within which to decide the taxpayer’s claim. The law is clear, plain and unequivocal: “x x x the Commissioner shall grant a refund or issue the tax credit certificate for creditable input taxes <b>within one hundred twenty (120) days</b> from the date of submission of complete documents.” Following the <i>verba legis</i> doctrine, this law must be applied exactly as worded since it is clear, plain and unequivocal. The taxpayer cannot simply file a petition with the CTA without waiting for the Commissioner’s decision within the 120-day mandatory and jurisdictional period. The CTA will have no jurisdiction because there will be no “decision” or “deemed a denial” decision of the Commissioner for the CTA to review. In San Roque’s case, it filed its petition with the CTA a mere 13 days after it filed its administrative claim with the Commissioner. Indisputably, San Roque knowingly violated the mandatory 120-day period, and it cannot blame anyone but itself.<br><br>Section 112(C) also expressly grants the taxpayer a 30-day period to appeal to the CTA the decision or inaction of the Commissioner, thus:<br><blockquote>x x x the taxpayer affected may, <b>within thirty (30) days from the receipt of the decision denying the claim or after the expiration of the one-hundred twenty day-period</b>, appeal the decision or the unacted claim with the Court of Tax Appeals. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>This law is clear, plain, and unequivocal. Following the well-settled <i>verba legis</i> doctrine, this law should be applied exactly as worded since it is clear, plain and unequivocal. As this law states, the taxpayer may, if he wishes, appeal the decision of the Commissioner to the CTA within 30 days from receipt of the Commissioner’s decision, or if the Commissioner does not act on the taxpayer’s claim within the 120-day period, the taxpayer may appeal to the CTA within 30 days from the expiration of the 120-day period.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>When Section 112 (C) states that “the taxpayer affected <b>may</b>, within thirty (30) days from receipt of the decision denying the claim or after the expiration of the one hundred twenty-day period, appeal the decision or the unacted claim with the Court of Tax Appeals,” the law does not make the 120+30 day periods optional just because the law uses the word “<b>may</b>.” The word “may” simply means that the taxpayer <b>may or may not appeal</b> the decision of the Commissioner within 30 days from receipt of the decision, or within 30 days from the expiration of the 120-day period. Certainly by no stretch of the imagination can the word “may” be construed as making the 120+30 day periods optional, allowing the taxpayer to file a judicial claim one day after filing the administrative claim with the Commissioner.<br><br>The old rule that the taxpayer may file the judicial claim, without waiting for the Commissioner’s decision if the two-year prescriptive period is about to expire, cannot apply because that rule was adopted before the enactment of the 30-day period. <b>The 30-day period was adopted precisely to do away with the old rule, so that under the VAT System the taxpayer will always have 30 days to file the judicial claim even if the Commissioner acts only on the 120th day, or does not act at all during the 120-day period.</b> With the 30-day period always available to the taxpayer, the taxpayer can no longer file a judicial claim for refund or credit of input VAT without waiting for the Commissioner to decide until the expiration of the 120-day period.<br><br>To repeat, a claim for tax refund or credit, like a claim for tax exemption, is construed strictly against the taxpayer. One of the conditions for a judicial claim of refund or credit under the VAT System is compliance with the 120+30 day mandatory and jurisdictional periods. Thus, strict compliance with the 120+30 day periods is necessary for such a claim to prosper, whether before, during, or after the effectivity of the Atlas doctrine, except for the period from the issuance of BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 on 10 December 2003 to 6 October 2010 when the <i>Aichi doctrine</i> was adopted, which again reinstated the 120+30 day periods as mandatory and jurisdictional.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote><br>In a nutshell, the rules on the determination of the prescriptive period for filing a tax refund or credit of unutilized input VAT, as provided in Section 112 of the Tax Code, are as follows:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">(1)</div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="JUSTIFY">An administrative claim must be filed with the CIR within two years after the close of the taxable quarter when the zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales were made.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(2)</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">The CIR has 120 days from the date of submission of complete documents in support of the administrative claim within which to decide whether to grant a refund or issue a tax credit certificate.

It then filed an administrative claim for refund of its unutilized input VAT for the third and fourth quarters of 2001 on September 30, 2003. Thus, the CIR had 120 days or until January 28, 2004, after the submission of TPI’s administrative claim and complete documents in support of its application, within which to decide on its claim. Then, it is only after the expiration of the 120-day period, if there is inaction on the part of the CIR, where TPI may elevate its claim with the CTA within 30 days.<br><br>In the present case, however, it appears that TPI’s judicial claims for refund of its unutilized input VAT covering the third and fourth quarters of 2001 were prematurely filed on October 24, 2003 and January 22, 2004, respectively.<br><br>However, although TPI’s judicial claim for the fourth quarter of 2001 has been filed prematurely, the most recent pronouncements of the Court provide for a window wherein the same may be entertained.<br><br>As held in the <i>San Roque</i> ponencia, strict compliance with the 120+30 day mandatory and jurisdictional periods is not necessary when the judicial claims are filed between December 10, 2003 <i>(issuance of BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 which states that the taxpayer need not wait for the 120-day period to expire before it could seek judicial relief)</i> to October 6, 2010 <i>(promulgation of the Aichi doctrine)</i>.<br><br>Clearly, therefore, TPI’s refund claim of unutilized input VAT for the third quarter of 2001 was denied for being prematurely filed with the CTA, while its refund claim of unutilized input VAT for the fourth quarter of 2001 may be entertained since it falls within the exception provided in the Court’s most recent rulings.<br><br>With that settled, we now resolve the issue of whether TPI sufficiently complied with the invoicing requirements under the Tax Code with respect to the fourth quarter of 2001.<br><br>Section 113 (A), in relation to Section 237 of the Tax Code, provides:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 113. <i>Invoicing and Accounting Requirements for VAT-Registered Persons.</i> –<br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%">(A)</td> <td colspan="2"><i>Invoicing Requirements.</i> – A VAT-registered person shall, for every sale, issue an invoice or receipt.

Although the same was merely stamped and not pre-printed, the same is sufficient compliance with the law, since the imprinting of the word “zero-rated” was required merely to distinguish sales subject to 10% VAT, those that are subject to 0% VAT (zero-rated) and exempt sales, to enable the Bureau of Internal Revenue to properly implement and enforce the other VAT provisions of the Tax Code.<br><br>Moreover, it is doctrinal that the Court will not lightly set aside the conclusions reached by the CTA which, by the very nature of its function of being dedicated exclusively to the resolution of tax problems, has accordingly developed an expertise on the subject, unless there has been an abuse or improvident exercise of authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>In <i>Barcelon, Roxas Securities, Inc. v.

It ruled that factual findings made by the CTA can only be disturbed on appeal if they are supported by substantial evidence or there is a showing of gross error or abuse on the part of the Tax Court. In the absence of any clear and convincing proof to the contrary, this Court must presume that the CTA rendered a decision which is valid in every respect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> premises considered, the instant petition is <b>PARTIALLY GRANTED</b>.
