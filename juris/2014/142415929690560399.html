Section 24 of the Special Economic Zone Act of 1995 provides:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 24. Exemption from National and Local Taxes. – Except for real property taxes on land owned by developers, no taxes, local and national, shall be imposed on business establishments operating within the ECOZONE. In lieu thereof, five percent (5%) of the gross income earned by all business enterprises within the ECOZONE shall be paid and remitted as follows:<br><br>a.&nbsp; Three percent (3%) to the National Government;<br><br>b. Two percent (2%) which shall be directly remitted by the business establishments to the treasurer’s office of the municipality or city where the enterprise is located.</blockquote><br>Section 51 of the law, on the other hand, provides:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 51. Ipso-Facto Clause. – All privileges, benefits, advantages or exemptions granted to special economic zones under Republic Act No. 7227, shall ipso-facto be accorded to special economic zones already created or to be created under this Act. The free port status shall not be vested upon new special economic zones.</blockquote><br>Based on Section 51, the trial court held that all privileges, benefits, advantages, or exemptions granted to special economic zones created under the Bases Conversion and Development Act of 1992 apply to special economic zones created under the Special Economic Zone Act of 1995.&nbsp; Since these benefits include exemption from payment of national or local taxes, these benefits apply to special economic zones owned by the PEZA.<br><br>According to the trial court, the PEZA remained tax-exempt regardless of Section 24 of the Special Economic Zone Act of 1995.&nbsp; It ruled that Section 24, which taxes real property owned by developers of economic zones, only applies to private developers of economic zones, not to public developers like the PEZA.&nbsp; The PEZA, therefore, is not liable for real property taxes on the land it owns.<br><br>Characterizing the PEZA as an agency of the National Government, the trial court ruled that the City had no authority to tax the PEZA under Sections 133(o) and 234(a) of the Local Government Code of 1991.<br><br>In the resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> dated June 14, 2006, the trial court granted the PEZA’s petition for declaratory relief and declared it exempt from payment of real property taxes.<br><br>The City filed a motion for reconsideration,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> which the trial court denied in its resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> dated September 26, 2006.<br><br>The City then appealed<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> to the Court of Appeals.<br><br>The Court of Appeals noted the following issues the City raised in its appellant’s brief: (1) whether the trial court had jurisdiction over the PEZA’s petition for declaratory relief; (2) whether the PEZA is a government agency performing governmental functions; and (3) whether the PEZA is exempt from payment of real property taxes.<br><br>The issues presented by the City, according to the Court of Appeals, are pure questions of law which should have been raised in a petition for review on certiorari directly filed before this court. Since the City availed itself of the wrong mode of appeal, the Court of Appeals dismissed the City’s appeal in the decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> dated January 11, 2008.<br><br>The City filed a motion for extension of time to file a motion for reconsideration,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> which the Court of Appeals denied in the resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> dated April 11, 2008.<br><br>Despite the denial of its motion for extension, the City filed a motion for reconsideration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp;

The City maintains that its appeal involved mixed questions of fact and law.&nbsp; According to the City, whether the PEZA performed governmental functions “cannot completely be addressed by law but [by] the factual and actual activities [the PEZA is] carrying out.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Even assuming that the petition involves pure questions of law, the City contends that the subject matter of the case “is of extreme importance with [far-reaching] consequence that [its magnitude] would surely shape and determine the course of our nation’s future.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>&nbsp; The Court of Appeals, the City argues, should have resolved the case on the merits.<br><br>The City insists that the trial court had no jurisdiction to hear the PEZA’s petition for declaratory relief.&nbsp; According to the City, the case involves real property located in the City of Lapu-Lapu.&nbsp; The petition for declaratory relief should have been filed before the Regional Trial Court of the City of Lapu-Lapu.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the Province of Bataan, the City of Baguio, and the Province of Cavite allegedly demanded real property taxes from the PEZA.&nbsp; The City argues that the PEZA should have likewise impleaded these local government units as respondents in its petition for declaratory relief.&nbsp; For its failure to do so, the PEZA violated Rule 63, Section 2 of the Rules of Court, and the trial court should have dismissed the petition.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>This court ordered the PEZA to comment on the City’s petition for review on certiorari.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>At the outset of its comment, the PEZA argues that the Court of Appeals’ decision dated January 11, 2008 had become final and executory.&nbsp; After the Court of Appeals had denied the City’s appeal, the City filed a motion for extension of time to file a motion for reconsideration.&nbsp; Arguing that the time to file a motion for reconsideration is not extendible, the PEZA filed its motion for reconsideration out of time.&nbsp; The City has no more right to appeal to this court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>The PEZA maintains that the City availed itself of the wrong mode of appeal before the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; Since the City raised pure questions of law in its appeal, the PEZA argues that the proper remedy is a petition for review on certiorari with this court, not an ordinary appeal before the appellate court.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals, therefore, correctly dismissed outright the City’s appeal under Rule 50, Section 2 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>On the merits, the PEZA argues that it is an agency and instrumentality of the National Government.&nbsp; It is therefore exempt from payment of real property taxes under Sections 133(o) and 234(a) of the Local Government Code.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>&nbsp; It adds that the tax privileges under Sections 24 and 51 of the Special Economic Zone Act of 1995 applied to it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>Considering that the site of the Mactan Economic Zone is a reserved land under Proclamation No. 1811, the PEZA claims that the properties sought to be taxed are lands of public dominion exempt from real property taxes.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>As to the jurisdiction issue, the PEZA counters that the Regional Trial Court of Pasay had jurisdiction to hear its petition for declaratory relief under Rule 63, Section 1 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>&nbsp; It also argued that it need not implead the Province of Bataan, the City of Baguio, and the Province of Cavite as respondents considering that their demands came after the PEZA had already filed the petition in court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br><b>Facts of G.R.

In the present case such is precisely the situation arising from the facts alleged in the petition for declaratory relief. As vigorously claimed by petitioner himself, respondent had already invaded or violated his right and caused him injury — all these giving him a complete cause of action enforceable in an appropriate ordinary civil action or proceeding. The dismissal of the action was, therefore, proper in the light of our ruling in De Borja vs. Villadolid, 47 O.G. (5) p. 2315, and Samson vs. Andal, G.R. No. L-3439, July 31, 1951, where we held that an action for declaratory relief should be filed before there has been a breach of a contract, statutes or right, and that it is sufficient to bar such action, that there had been a breach — which would constitute actionable violation.

Clearly, it does not suffice to constitute a justiciable controversy. The Petition does not even allege any indication or manifest intent on the part of any of the respondents below to champion an electoral candidate, or to urge their so-called flock to vote for, or not to vote for, a particular candidate. It is a time-honored rule that sheer speculation does not give rise to an actionable right.<br><br>Obviously, there is no factual allegation that SJS’ rights are being subjected to any threatened, imminent and inevitable violation that should be prevented by the declaratory relief sought. The judicial power and duty of the courts to settle actual controversies involving rights that are legally demandable and enforceable cannot be exercised when there is no actual or threatened violation of a legal right.<br><br>All that the 5-page SJS Petition prayed for was "that the question raised in paragraph 9 hereof be resolved."

In transferring exclusive jurisdiction over appealed tax cases to the CTA, it can reasonably be assumed that the law intended to transfer also such power as is deemed necessary, if not indispensable, in aid of such appellate jurisdiction. There is no perceivable reason why the transfer should only be considered as partial, not total.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>If this Court were to sustain petitioners' contention that jurisdiction over their certiorari petition lies with the CA, this Court would be confirming the exercise by two judicial bodies, the CA and the CTA, of jurisdiction over basically the same subject matter – precisely the split-jurisdiction situation which is anathema to the orderly administration of justice. The Court cannot accept that such was the legislative motive, especially considering that the law expressly confers on the CTA, the tribunal with the specialized competence over tax and tariff matters, the role of judicial review over local tax cases without mention of any other court that may exercise such power. Thus, the Court agrees with the ruling of the CA that since appellate jurisdiction over private respondents' complaint for tax refund is vested in the CTA, it follows that a petition for certiorari seeking nullification of an interlocutory order issued in the said case should, likewise, be filed with the same court. To rule otherwise would lead to an absurd situation where one court decides an appeal in the main case while another court rules on an incident in the very same case.<br><br>Stated differently, it would be somewhat incongruent with the pronounced judicial abhorrence to split jurisdiction to conclude that the intention of the law is to divide the authority over a local tax case filed with the RTC by giving to the CA or this Court jurisdiction to issue a writ of certiorari against interlocutory orders of the RTC but giving to the CTA the jurisdiction over the appeal from the decision of the trial court in the same case. It is more in consonance with logic and legal soundness to conclude that the grant of appellate jurisdiction to the CTA over tax cases filed in and decided by the RTC carries with it the power to issue a writ of certiorari when necessary in aid of such appellate jurisdiction. The supervisory power or jurisdiction of the CTA to issue a writ of certiorari in aid of its appellate jurisdiction should co-exist with, and be a complement to, its appellate jurisdiction to review, by appeal, the final orders and decisions of the RTC, in order to have complete supervision over the acts of the latter.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[217]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br>In this case, the petition for injunction filed before the Regional Trial Court of Pasay was a local tax case originally decided by the trial court in its original jurisdiction.&nbsp; Since the PEZA assailed a judgment, not an interlocutory order, of the Regional Trial Court, the PEZA’s proper remedy was an appeal to the Court of Tax Appeals.<br><br>Considering that the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Tax Appeals is to the exclusion of all other courts, the Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction to take cognizance of the PEZA’s petition.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals acted without jurisdiction in rendering the decision in CA-G.R.

OPLE: Madam President, the reason for this concern is really that when the government creates a corporation, there is a sense in which this corporation becomes exempt from the test of economic performance. We know what happened in the past. If a government corporation loses, then it makes its claim upon the taxpayers' money through new equity infusions from the government and what is always invoked is the common good. That is the reason why this year, out of a budget of P115 billion for the entire government, about P28 billion of this will go into equity infusions to support a few government financial institutions. And this is all taxpayers' money which could have been relocated to agrarian reform, to social services like health and education, to augment the salaries of grossly underpaid public employees. And yet this is all going down the drain.<br><br>Therefore, when we insert the phrase "ECONOMIC VIABILITY" together with the "common good," this becomes a restraint on future enthusiasts for state capitalism to excuse themselves from the responsibility of meeting the market test so that they become viable. And so, Madam President, I reiterate, for the committee's consideration and I am glad that I am joined in this proposal by Commissioner Foz, the insertion of the standard of "ECONOMIC VIABILITY OR THE ECONOMIC TEST," together with the common good.<br><br>. . . .</blockquote><br>Clearly, the test of economic viability does not apply to government entities vested with corporate powers and performing essential public services. The State is obligated to render essential public services regardless of the economic viability of providing such service.

Relationship with the Local Government Units. - Except as herein provided, the local government units comprising the ECOZONE shall retain their basic autonomy and identity.

Section 24 of the Special Economic Zone Act of 1995 provides:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 24. Exemption from National and Local Taxes. — Except for real property taxes on land owned by developers, no taxes, local and national, shall be imposed <i>on business establishments operating within the ECOZONE.</i> In lieu thereof, five percent (5%) of the gross income earned by <i>all business enterprises within the ECOZONE</i> shall be paid and remitted as follows:<br><br><blockquote>(a) Three percent (3%) to the National Government;<br><br>(b) Two percent (2%) which shall be directly remitted by the business establishments to the treasurer's office of the municipality or city where the enterprise is located. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote></blockquote><br>Tax exemptions provided under Section 24 apply only to business establishments operating within economic zones.&nbsp; Considering that the PEZA is not a business establishment but an instrumentality performing governmental functions, Section 24 is inapplicable to the PEZA.<br><br>Also, contrary to the PEZA’s claim, developers of economic zones, whether public or private developers, are liable for real property taxes on lands they own.&nbsp; Section 24 does not distinguish between a public and private developer.&nbsp; Thus, courts cannot distinguish.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[276]</sup>&nbsp; Unless the public developer is exempt under the Local Government Code or under its charter enacted after the Local Government Code’s effectivity, the public developer must pay real property taxes on their land.<br><br>At any rate, the PEZA cannot be taxed for real property taxes even if it acts as a developer or operator of special economic zones.&nbsp; The PEZA is an instrumentality of the national government exempt from payment of real property taxes under Section 133(o) of the Local Government Code.&nbsp; As this court said in <i>Manila International Airport Authority,</i> “there must be express language in the law empowering local governments to tax national government instrumentalities.&nbsp; Any doubt whether such power exists is resolved against local governments.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[277]</sup><br><br><b><center>V.
