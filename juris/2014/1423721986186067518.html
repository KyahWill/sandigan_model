SP No. 92607, affirming the deportation of petitioner Tze Sun Wong (petitioner).<br><br><center><b>The Facts</b><br></center><br>Petitioner is a Chinese citizen who immigrated to the Philippines in 1975 and subsequently acquired a permanent resident status in 1982. As the records would show, he studied, married, and continued to reside in the country, and even owned a company called Happy Sun Travel and Tours.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>On September 12, 2000, respondent Kenny Wong (respondent), owner and proprietor of San Andres Construction Supply, filed a Complaint-Affidavit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> against petitioner before the Bureau of Immigration (BOI), alleging that the latter had misrepresented, in his driver’s license application, that he was a Filipino citizen. Respondent also averred that petitioner and his business partner, Tina Yu, issued post-dated checks in the amount of p886,922.00 which, however, bounced to his damage and prejudice. Thus, taking cue from the foregoing acts, respondent prayed that petitioner be investigated by the BOI for violation of immigration laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>In his Counter-Affidavit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> dated September 28, 2000, petitioner denied respondent’s claim of misrepresentation, stating that when he applied for a driver’s license, it was another person who filled up the application form for him. However, said person entered the wrong information, particularly, on his name, birth year, and nationality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Finding probable cause, the Special Prosecutor filed with the BOI the applicable deportation charges<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> against petitioner, docketed as BSI-D.C.

The Mission Order was later recalled<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> and the Law and Investigation Division endorsed the records to the Board of Special Inquiry which directed the parties to submit their respective memoranda.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br><center><b>The BOI Ruling</b><br></center><br>In a Judgment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> dated October 2, 2002, the BOI Board of Commissioners ordered the deportation of petitioner on the grounds of: (<i>a</i>) illegal use of alias, <i>i.e</i>., Joseph Wong, which was the name appearing in his driver’s license application; and (<i>b</i>) misrepresenting himself as a Filipino citizen in the same application, in violation of Section 37 (a) (7) and (9)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> of Commonwealth Act No. 613,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> otherwise known as “The Philippine Immigration Act of 1940” (Immigration Act),&nbsp; in relation to Sections 1, 2, and 3<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> of Republic Act No. (RA) 6085.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Aside from pointing out the misrepresentations made by petitioner, the BOI took judicial notice of the fact that driver’s license applications require the personal appearance of the applicant in order to prevent fraud. Thus, by allowing someone to apply for him, he actively involved himself in the preparation and issuance of a fraudulent driver’s license. By the same account, he cannot then aver that he was without any participation in the entry of his supposed Philippine citizenship in his driver’s license.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> which was eventually denied by the BOI in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> dated December 4, 2002.

Secretary of Justice Raul M. Gonzalez rendered a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> dated September 9, 2005, rejecting petitioner’s argument on the basis of Section 8 of the Immigration Act which simply requires that “[i]n any case coming before the [BOI] Board of Commissioners, the decision of any two members shall prevail[,]” as in this case. It was added that when petitioner sought to reconsider said Judgment, all four (4) commissioners<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> decided in favor of his deportation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Dissatisfied, petitioner filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> before the CA.<br><br><center><b>The CA Ruling</b></center><br>In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> dated May 15, 2007, the CA denied<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> the <i>certiorari</i> petition. Preliminarily, it found that petitioner chose the wrong remedy considering that the decisions of the BOI Board of Commissioners are directly appealable to the CA under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> The CA also observed that even on the assumption that the Secretary of Justice was given the authority to countermand the BOI Judgment under the Administrative Code, no countermand was made, and hence, the same should have already attained finality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> On the substantive aspects, the CA affirmed the ruling of the Secretary of Justice that petitioner should be deported for violating the abovementioned rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Petitioner sought reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> but was denied in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> dated October 23, 2007, hence, this petition.<br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b></center><br>The sole issue for the Court’s resolution is whether or not the CA correctly denied petitioner’s petition for <i>certiorari</i>.<br><br><center><b>The Court’s Ruling</b></center><br>The petition is without merit.<br><br>The Court first discusses the propriety of petitioner’s recourse before the CA.<br><br>Section 1, Rule 43 of the Rules of Court clearly states that decisions of <b>any quasi-judicial agency in the exercise of its quasi-judicial functions</b> (except to judgments or final orders issued under the Labor Code of the Philippines) shall be appealed to the CA under this rule.<br><br><blockquote><center>RULE 43<br></center><br>Appeals From the Court of Tax Appeals and Quasi-Judicial Agencies to the Court of Appeals<br><br>Section 1. <i>Scope</i>. — This Rule shall apply to appeals from judgments or final orders of the Court of Tax Appeals and from awards, judgments, final orders or resolutions of or authorized by <b>any quasi-judicial agency in the exercise of its quasi-judicial functions.</b> Among these agencies are the Civil Service Commission, Central Board of Assessment Appeals, Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of the President, Land Registration Authority, Social Security Commission, Civil Aeronautics Board, Bureau of Patents, Trademarks and Technology Transfer, National Electrification Administration, Energy Regulatory Board, National Telecommunications Commission, Department of Agrarian Reform under Republic Act No. 6657, Government Service Insurance System, Employees Compensation Commission, Agricultural Inventions Board, Insurance Commission, Philippine Atomic Energy Commission, Board of Investments, Construction Industry Arbitration Commission, and voluntary arbitrators authorized by law. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The statutory basis of the CA’s appellate jurisdiction over decisions rendered by quasi-judicial agencies (except those falling within the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in accordance with the Constitution, the Labor Code of the Philippines under Presidential Decree No. 442) in the abovementioned respect is Section 9 (3) of Batas Pambansa Bilang 129,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> as amended:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Section 9. <i>Jurisdiction</i>. – The Court of Appeals shall exercise:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(3) Exclusive appellate jurisdiction over all final judgments, decisions resolutions, orders or awards of Regional Trial Courts and <b><u>quasi-judicial agencies, instrumentalities, boards or commissions, including the Securities and Exchange Commission</u></b>, the Social Security Commission, the Employees Compensation Commission and the Civil Service Commission, except those falling within the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in accordance with the Constitution, the Labor Code of the Philippines under Presidential Decree No. 442, as amended, the provisions of this Act, and of subparagraph (1) of the third paragraph and subparagraph (4) of the fourth paragraph of Section 17 of the Judiciary Act of 1948.<br><br>x x x x</blockquote><br>Notably, in <i>Cayao-Lasam v. Spouses Ramolete</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> it was clarified that the enumeration of the quasi-judicial agencies under Section 1, Rule 43 is not exclusive:<br><br><blockquote>The Rule expressly provides that it should be applied to appeals from awards, judgments, final orders or resolutions <b>of any</b> quasi-judicial agency in the exercise of its quasi-judicial functions. The phrase “among these agencies” confirms that the enumeration made in the Rule is not exclusive to the agencies therein listed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></blockquote><br>Thus, although unmentioned in the enumeration, the Court, in the case of <i>Dwikarna v. Hon. Domingo</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> (<i>Dwikarna</i>), held that the decisions rendered by the BOI Board of Commissioners may be appealable to the CA via Rule 43 in the event that a motion for reconsideration therefrom is denied:<br><br><blockquote>If petitioner is dissatisfied with the decision of the Board of Commissioners of the Bureau of Immigration, he can move for its reconsideration. <b>If his motion is denied, then he can elevate his case by way of a petition for review before the Court of Appeals, pursuant to Section 1, Rule 43 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>It bears elucidation that the availability of a Rule 43 appeal to the CA from the BOI Board of Commissioners as ruled in <i>Dwikarna </i>presupposes the presence of any of the exceptions to the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> considering that the Secretary of Justice may still review the decisions of the aforesaid body. In <i>Caoile v. Vivo</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> (Caoile), it was held:<br><br><blockquote>[S]ince the Commissioners of Immigration are under the Department of Justice<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> and, in this case, they followed the Secretary’s Order setting aside the individual actions of the former Commissioners, the aggrieved parties should have exhausted their administrative remedies by appealing to the Secretary before seeking judicial intervention.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></blockquote><br>Citing <i>Caoile,</i> the Court, in the more recent case of <i>Kiani v. The Bureau of Immigration and Deportation</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> expounded on the procedure:<br><br><blockquote>Under Section 8, Chapter 3, Title I, Book III of Executive Order No. 292, the power to deport aliens is vested on the President of the Philippines, subject to the requirements of due process. The Immigration Commissioner is vested with authority to deport aliens under Section 37 of the Philippine Immigration Act of 1940, as amended.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Thus, a party aggrieved by a Deportation Order issued by the [Board of Commissioner (BOC)] is proscribed from assailing said Order in the RTC even via a petition for a writ of <i>habeas corpus.</i> Conformably with [the] ruling of the Court in [<i>Commissioner</i>] <i>Domingo v. Scheer</i> (see 466 Phil. 235, 264-284 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2004]</sup>), such party may file a motion for the reconsideration thereof before the BOC. The Court ruled therein that “there is no law or rule which provides that a Summary Deportation Order issued by the BOC in the exercise of its authority becomes final after one year from its issuance, or that the aggrieved party is barred from filing a motion for a reconsideration of any order or decision of the BOC.” The Court, likewise, declared that in deportation proceedings, the Rules of Court may be applied in a suppletory manner and that the aggrieved party may file a motion for reconsideration of a decision or final order under Rule 37 of said Rules.<br><br><b>In case such motion for reconsideration is denied by the BOC, the aggrieved party may appeal to the Secretary of Justice and, if the latter denies the appeal, to the Office of the President of the Philippines [(OP)]. The party may also choose to file a petition for <i>certiorari</i> with the CA under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, on the ground that the Secretary of Justice acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to excess or lack of jurisdiction in dismissing the appeal, the remedy of appeal not being adequate and speedy remedy. In case the Secretary of Justice dismisses the appeal, the aggrieved party may resort to filing a petition for review under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court, as amended</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></blockquote><br>Thus, to recap, from the denial of the BOI Board of Commissioners’ motion for reconsideration, the aggrieved party has three (3) options: (a) he may file an appeal directly to the CA via Rule 43 provided that he shows that any of the exceptions to the exhaustion doctrine attend; (b) absent any of the exceptions, he may exhaust the available administrative remedies within the executive machinery, namely, an appeal to the Secretary of Justice and then to the OP, and thereafter, appeal the OP’s decisions via Rule 43;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> or (c) he may directly resort to <i>certiorari</i> before the CA strictly on jurisdictional grounds, provided that he explains why any of the aforementioned remedies cannot be taken as “adequate and speedy.” Anent the last of these options, the Court, in <i>Rigor v. CA,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> had this to say:<br><br><blockquote>For a writ of <i>certiorari</i> to issue, a petitioner must not only prove that the tribunal, board or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions has acted without or in excess of jurisdiction.<b><u> He must also show that he has no plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law against what he perceives to be a legitimate grievance.</u></b> A recourse affording prompt relief from the injurious effects of the judgment or acts of a lower court or tribunal is considered “plain, speedy and adequate” remedy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></blockquote><br>Case law explains that “[a] remedy is plain, speedy and adequate if it will promptly relieve the petitioner from the injurious effects of the judgment, order, or resolution of the lower court or agency.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>&nbsp; In this relation, it has been recognized that the extraordinary remedy of <i>certiorari </i>may be deemed proper “when it is necessary to prevent irreparable damages and injury to a party, x x x where an appeal would be slow, inadequate, and insufficient, x x x and&nbsp; x x x in case of urgency.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>In this case, petitioner instituted an administrative appeal before the Secretary of Justice and thereafter sought direct recourse to the CA via <i>certiorari</i>, thereby leap-frogging other available remedies, the first being a subsequent administrative appeal to the OP and, eventually, an appeal of the OP decision to the CA via Rule 43. While these remedies remained available to him, the Court deems that they would not afford him speedy and adequate relief in view of the plain imminence of his deportation, by virtue of the issuance of a warrant of deportation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> The urgency of such circumstance therefore justified his direct resort to <i>certiorari</i>.<br><br>This notwithstanding, the Court nonetheless denies the petition on substantive grounds.<br><br>It must be highlighted that the case under consideration essentially calls for the Court to determine whether the CA’s dismissal of petitioner’s <i>certiorari </i>petition before it was correct.<br><br>“In a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i> brought against a court with jurisdiction over a case, the petitioner carries the burden to prove that the respondent tribunal committed not merely a reversible error but a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in issuing the impugned order. Showing mere abuse of discretion is not enough, for the abuse must be shown to be grave. Grave abuse of discretion means either that the judicial or quasi-judicial power was exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility, or that the respondent judge, tribunal or board evaded a positive duty, or virtually refused to perform the duty enjoined or to act in contemplation of law, such as when such judge, tribunal or board exercising judicial or quasi-judicial powers acted in a capricious or whimsical manner as to be equivalent to lack of jurisdiction.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>Petitioner’s <i>certiorari</i> petition before the CA basically revolves on his denial of the acts of misrepresentation imputed against him, claiming that the same do not warrant his deportation. However, the commission of said acts involves factual matters that have already been established during the proceedings before the BOI Board of Commissioners. In this regard, it is crucial to point out that “<b><u>[t]he Bureau is the agency that can best determine whether petitioner violated certain provisions of the Philippine Immigration Act of 1940, as amended. In this jurisdiction, courts will not interfere in matters which are addressed to the sound discretion of government agencies entrusted with the regulation of activities coming under the special technical knowledge and training of such agencies.</u></b> By reason of the special knowledge and expertise of administrative departments over matters falling within their jurisdiction, they are in a better position to pass judgment thereon and their findings of fact in that regard are generally accorded respect, if not finality, by the courts.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> As petitioner has not sufficiently demonstrated any cogent reason to deviate from the BOI Board of Commissioners’ findings, courts are wont to defer to its judgment.<br><br>Besides, petitioner’s defenses anent what had actually transpired during the relevant incidents surrounding his driver’s license application apparently constitute mere self-serving allegations barren of any independent proof. While he blamed the unnamed fixer filling up the erroneous details in his application, his version of the story remained uncorroborated. The lack of testimony on the part of the fixer leaves much to be desired from petitioner’s theory.<br><br>Moreover, the Court’s review of the present case is via a petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, which generally bars any question pertaining to the factual issues raised. The well-settled rule is that questions of fact are not reviewable in petitions for review under Rule 45, subject only to certain exceptions, among them, the lack of sufficient support in evidence of the trial court’s judgment or the appellate court’s misapprehension of the adduced facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> None of these exceptions was, however, convincingly shown to attend in this case.<br><br>Now, on the matter of the alleged nullity of the BOI Board of Commissioners’ Judgment due to the fact that it had been signed only by two (2) commissioners, suffice it to state that Section 8 of the Immigration Act simply requires that in any case coming before the BOI Board of Commissioners, the decision of any two (2) members shall prevail:<br><br><blockquote><center>BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS<br></center><br>Sec. 8. Decision of the Board. - The board of Commissioners, hereinafter referred to in this Act, shall be composed of the Commissioner of Immigration and the two Deputy Commissioners. In the absence of a member of the Board, the Department Head shall designate an officer or employee in the Bureau of Immigration to serve as a member thereof. In any case coming before the Board of Commissioners, the decision of any two members shall prevail.<br></blockquote><br>Petitioner argues that the foregoing rule only refers to the number of votes necessary to constitute the decision of the Board, insisting that deliberation should still be made by all commissioners as a collegial body.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>Petitioner’s argument is correct in theory since deliberation by all members of the collegial body is evidently what the rule contemplates, with the votes of only two (2) members being sufficient for a decision to prevail. Unfortunately, however, petitioner has not shown any proof that deliberations were not conducted by all commissioners before the questioned Judgment was made. The rule is well-settled that he who alleges a fact has the burden of proving it and a mere allegation is not evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Thus, once more, his self-serving assertion cannot be given credence. This is especially so in light of the presumption of regularity, which herein ought to prevail due to the absence of any clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. <i>Bustillo v. People</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> states:<br><br><blockquote>The presumption of regularity of official acts may be rebutted by affirmative evidence of irregularity or failure to perform a duty. The presumption, however, prevails until it is overcome by no less than clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. Thus, unless the presumption is rebutted, it becomes conclusive. Every reasonable intendment will be made in support of the presumption and in case of doubt as to an officer’s act being lawful or unlawful, construction should be in favor of its lawfulness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup></blockquote><br>In particular, the presumption that the Judgment had been deliberated by the BOI Board of Commissioners as a collegial body stands. In any event, the lack of any concurrence or dissension from the two (2) other commissioners missing on the face of the October 2, 2002 Judgment has already been placated by their eventual signing of full concurrence in the subsequent Resolution dated December 4, 2002 denying petitioner’s motion for reconsideration.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.
