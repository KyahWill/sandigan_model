Allegations of violation of the right to health and the right to a healthful and balanced environment are also included.<br><br>For a better perspective of the facts of these cases, we again trace the history of the Pandacan oil terminals, as well as the intervening events prior to the reclassification of the land use from Industrial II to Commercial I under Ordinance No. 8027 until the creation of Medium Industrial Zone and Heavy Industrial Zone pursuant to Ordinance No. 8187.<br><br><b><i>History of the Pandacan<br>Oil Terminals</i></b><br><br>We quote the following from the Resolution of the Court in G.R. No. 156052:<br><blockquote>Pandacan (one of the districts of the City of Manila) is situated along the banks of the Pasig [R]iver. At the turn of the twentieth century, Pandacan was unofficially designated as the industrial center of Manila. The area, then largely uninhabited, was ideal for various emerging industries as the nearby river facilitated the transportation of goods and products. In the 1920s, it was classified as an industrial zone. Among its early industrial settlers were the oil companies. x x x<br><br>On December 8, 1941, the Second World War reached the shores of the Philippine Islands. x x x [I]n their zealous attempt to fend off the Japanese Imperial Army, the United States Army took control of the Pandacan Terminals and hastily made plans to destroy the storage facilities to deprive the advancing Japanese Army of a valuable logistics weapon. The U.S. Army burned unused petroleum, causing a frightening conflagration. Historian Nick Joaquin recounted the events as follows:<br><blockquote>After the USAFFE evacuated the City late in December 1941, all army fuel storage dumps were set on fire. The flames spread, enveloping the City in smoke, setting even the rivers ablaze, endangering bridges and all riverside buildings. … For one week longer, the “open city” blazed—a cloud of smoke by day, a pillar of fire by night.<br></blockquote>The fire consequently destroyed the Pandacan Terminals and rendered its network of depots and service stations inoperative.<br><br>After the war, the oil depots were reconstructed. Pandacan changed as Manila rebuilt itself. The three major oil companies resumed the operation of their depots. But the district was no longer a sparsely populated industrial zone; it had evolved into a bustling, hodgepodge community. Today, Pandacan has become a densely populated area inhabited by about 84,000 people, majority of whom are urban poor who call it home. Aside from numerous industrial installations, there are also small businesses, churches, restaurants, schools, daycare centers and residences situated there. Malacañang Palace, the official residence of the President of the Philippines and the seat of governmental power, is just two kilometers away. There is a private school near the Petron depot. Along the walls of the Shell facility are shanties of informal settlers. More than 15,000 students are enrolled in elementary and high schools situated near these facilities. A university with a student population of about 25,000 is located directly across the depot on the banks of the Pasig [R]iver.<br><br>The 36-hectare Pandacan Terminals house the oil companies’ distribution terminals and depot facilities. The refineries of Chevron and Shell in Tabangao and Bauan, both in Batangas, respectively, are connected to the Pandacan Terminals through a 114-kilometer underground pipeline system. Petron’s refinery in Limay, Bataan, on the other hand, also services the depot. The terminals store fuel and other petroleum products and supply 95% of the fuel requirements of Metro Manila, 50% of Luzon’s consumption and 35% nationwide. Fuel can also be transported through barges along the Pasig [R]iver or tank trucks via the South Luzon Expressway.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote><b><i>Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)<br>dated 12 October 2001 between the oil companies<br>and the Department of Energy (DOE)</i></b><br><br>On 12 October 2001, the oil companies and the DOE entered into a MOA<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> “in light of recent international developments involving acts of terrorism on civilian and government landmarks,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> “potential new security risks relating to the Pandacan oil terminals and the impact on the surrounding community which may be affected,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> and “to address the perceived risks posed by the proximity of communities, businesses and offices to the Pandacan oil terminals, consistent with the principle of sustainable development.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The stakeholders acknowledged that “there is a need for a comprehensive study to address the economic, social, environmental and security concerns with the end in view of formulating a Master Plan to address and minimize the potential risks and hazards posed by the proximity of communities, businesses and offices to the Pandacan oil terminals without adversely affecting the security and reliability of supply and distribution of petroleum products to Metro Manila and the rest of Luzon, and the interests of consumers and users of such petroleum products in those areas.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br><b><i>The enactment of Ordinance No. 8027<br>against the continued stay of the oil depots<br></i></b><br><br>The MOA, however, was short-lived.<br><br>On 20 November 2001, during the incumbency of former Mayor Jose L. Atienza, Jr. (Mayor Atienza) – now one of the petitioners in G.R.

No. 156052;<br>The mayor has the mandatory legal duty<br>to enforce Ordinance No. 8027 and order<br>the removal of the Pandacan terminals</i></b><br><br>On 7 March 2007, the Court granted the petition for <i>mandamus</i>, and directed then respondent Mayor Atienza to immediately enforce Ordinance No. 8027.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Confined to the resolution of the following issues raised by the petitioners, to wit:<br><blockquote>1. whether respondent [Mayor Atienza] has the mandatory legal duty to enforce Ordinance No. 8027 and order the removal of the Pandacan Terminals, and<br><br>2. whether the June 26, 2002 MOU and the resolutions ratifying it can amend or repeal Ordinance No. 8027.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br></blockquote>the Court declared:<br><blockquote>x x x [T]he Local Government Code imposes upon respondent the duty, as city mayor, to “enforce all laws and ordinances relative to the governance of the city.” One of these is Ordinance No. 8027. As the chief executive of the city, he has the duty to enforce Ordinance No. 8027 as long as it has not been repealed by the <i>Sanggunian</i> or annulled by the courts. He has no other choice. It is his ministerial duty to do so. x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The question now is whether the MOU entered into by respondent with the oil companies and the subsequent resolutions passed by the <i>Sanggunian</i> have made the respondent’s duty to enforce Ordinance No. 8027 doubtful, unclear or uncertain. x x x<br><br>We need not resolve this issue. Assuming that the terms of the MOU were inconsistent with Ordinance No. 8027, the resolutions which ratified it and made it binding on the City of Manila expressly gave it full force and effect <b>only until April 30, 2003</b>. Thus, at present, there is nothing that legally hinders respondent from enforcing Ordinance No. 8027.<br><br>Ordinance No. 8027 was enacted right after the Philippines, along with the rest of the world, witnessed the horror of the September 11, 2001 attack on the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City. <b>The objective of the ordinance is to protect the residents of Manila from the catastrophic devastation that will surely occur in case of a terrorist attack on the Pandacan Terminals.

No. 156052;<br>Ordinance No. 8027 was not impliedly repealed<br>by Ordinance No. 8119</i></b><br><br>The Court also ruled that Ordinance No. 8027 was not impliedly repealed by Ordinance No. 8119. On this score, the Court ratiocinated:<br><blockquote>For the first kind of implied repeal, there must be an irreconcilable conflict between the two ordinances. There is no conflict between the two ordinances. Ordinance No. 8027 reclassified the Pandacan area from Industrial II to Commercial I. Ordinance No. 8119, Section 23, designated it as a “Planned Unit Development/Overlay Zone (O-PUD).” In its Annex “C” which defined the zone boundaries, the Pandacan area was shown to be within the “High Density Residential/Mixed Use Zone (R-3/MXD).” x x x [B]oth ordinances actually have a common objective, <i>i.e.</i>, to shift the zoning classification from industrial to commercial (Ordinance No. 8027) or mixed residential commercial (Ordinance No. 8119)<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Ordinance No. 8027 is a special law since it deals specifically with a certain area described therein (the Pandacan oil depot area) whereas Ordinance No. 8119 can be considered a general law as it covers the entire city of Manila.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>x x x The repealing clause of Ordinance No. 8119 cannot be taken to indicate the legislative intent to repeal all prior inconsistent laws on the subject matter, including Ordinance No. 8027, a special enactment, since the aforequoted minutes (an official record of the discussions in the <i>Sanggunian</i>) actually indicated the clear intent to preserve the provisions of Ordinance No. 8027.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br></blockquote><b><i>Filing of a draft Resolution amending<br>Ordinance No. 8027 effectively allowing<br>the oil depots to stay in the Pandacan area;<br>Manifestation and Motion to forestall<br>the passing of the new Ordinance<br>filed in G.R.

As to the city councilors who joined the petitioners in assailing the validity of Ordinance No. 8187, Shell posits that they cannot invoke the ruling in <i>Prof. David v. Pres. Macapagal-Arroyo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> where the Court held that legislators may question the constitutionality of a statute, if and when it infringes upon their prerogatives as legislators, because of the absence of the allegation that the assailed ordinance indeed infringes upon their prerogatives.<br><br>Former Mayor Lim submitted a similar position supported by a number of cases on the concept of <i>locus standi</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> the direct injury test,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> an outline of the stringent requirements of legal standing when suing as a citizen,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> as a taxpayer,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> as a legislator and in cases where class suits are filed in behalf of all citizens.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup><br><br>Their arguments are misplaced.<br><br>In G.R.

Thus:<br><blockquote>To support the assertion that petitioners have a clear legal right to the enforcement of the ordinance, petitioner SJS states that it is a political party registered with the Commission on Elections and has its offices in Manila. It claims to have many members who are residents of Manila. The other petitioners, Cabigao and Tumbokon, are allegedly residents of Manila.<br><br>We need not belabor this point. We have ruled in previous cases that when a <i>mandamus</i> proceeding concerns a public right and its object is to compel a public duty, the people who are interested in the execution of the laws are regarded as the real parties in interest and they need not show any specific interest.

Necessarily, the people who are interested in the nullification of such an ordinance are themselves the real parties in interest, for which reason, they are no longer required to show any specific interest therein. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that SJS, now represented by SJS Officer Alcantara, has been recognized by the Court in G.R. No. 156052 to have legal standing to sue in connection with the same subject matter herein considered. The rest of the petitioners are residents of Manila. Hence, all of them have a direct interest in the prohibition proceedings against the enforcement of the assailed ordinance.<br><br>In the case of <i>Initiatives for Dialogue and Empowerment through Alternative Legal Services, Inc.

Thus:<br><blockquote>Forum shopping is an act of a party, against whom an adverse judgment or order has been rendered in one forum, of seeking and possibly getting a favorable opinion in another forum, other than by appeal or special civil action for <i>certiorari</i>. It may also be the institution of two or more actions or proceedings grounded on the same cause on the supposition that one or the other court would make a favorable disposition.

No. 156052, which were both incidental to the enforcement of the decision favorable to them brought about by the intervening events after the judgment had become final and executory, and which involve the same Ordinance assailed in these petitions, we so hold that the filing of the instant petitions is not barred by <i><i>res judicata</i></i>.<br><br>In the same case of <i>Spouses Cruz v. Spouses Caraos</i> involving the re-filing of a complaint, which had been earlier dismissed without qualification that the dismissal was with prejudice, and which had not been decided on the merits, the Court declared that such re-filing did not amount to forum shopping. It ratiocinated:<br><blockquote>It is not controverted that the allegations of the respective complaints in both Civil Case No. 95-1387 and Civil Case No. 96-0225 are <i>similarly worded</i>, and are identical in all relevant details, including typographical errors, except for the additional allegations in support of respondents’ prayer for the issuance of preliminary injunction in Civil Case No. 95-1387. It is similarly not disputed that both actions involve the same transactions; same essential facts and circumstances; and raise identical causes of actions, subject matter, and issues.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>x x x The dismissal of Civil Case No. 95-1387 was without prejudice. Indeed, the Order dated 20 November 1995, dismissing Civil Case No. 95-1387 was an unqualified dismissal. More significantly, its dismissal was not based on grounds under paragraphs (f), (h), and (i) of Section 1 of Rule 16 of the Rules of Court, which dismissal shall bar the refiling of the same action or claim as crystallized in Section 5 of Rule 16 thereof, thus:<br><blockquote>SEC. 5. <i>Effect of dismissal</i>. – Subject to the right of appeal, an order granting a motion to dismiss based on paragraphs (f), (h), and (i) of section 1 hereof shall bar the refiling of the same action or claim.<br></blockquote>From the foregoing, it is clear that dismissals under paragraphs (f), (h), and (i) of Section 1 of Rule 16 of the Rules of Court constitute <i><i>res judicata</i></i>, to wit:<br><blockquote>(f) That the cause of action is barred by a prior judgment or by the statute of limitations;<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(h) That the claim or demand set forth in the plaintiff’s pleading has been paid, waived, abandoned, or otherwise extinguished;<br><br>(i) That the claim on which the action is founded is unenforceable under the provisions of the statute of frauds.<br></blockquote><i>Res judicata</i> or bar by prior judgment is a doctrine which holds that a matter that has been adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction must be deemed to have been finally and conclusively settled if it arises in any subsequent litigation between the same parties and for the same cause. <i>Res judicata</i> exists when the following elements are present: (a) the former judgment must be final; (b) the court which rendered judgment had jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter; (3) <b>it must be a judgment on the merits</b>; and (d) and there must be, between the first and second actions, identity of parties, subject matter, and cause of action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> (Emphasis supplied; citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Here, it should be noted that this Court denied the said <i>Manifestation</i> and <i>Urgent Motion</i>, and refused to act on the succeeding pleadings, for being moot.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> Clearly, the merits of the motion were not considered by the Court. The following disquisition of the Court in <i>Spouses Cruz v.

As earlier underscored, the dismissal was one without prejudice. Verily, it was not a judgment on the merits. <b>It bears reiterating that a judgment on the merits is one rendered after a determination of which party is right, as distinguished from a judgment rendered upon some preliminary or formal or merely technical point.</b> The dismissal of the case without prejudice indicates the absence of a decision on the merits and leaves the parties free to litigate the matter in a subsequent action as though the dismissed action had not been commenced.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> (Emphasis supplied; citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Considering that there is definitely no forum shopping in the instant cases, we need not discuss in detail the elements of forum shopping.<br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>The Local Government Code of 1991 expressly provides that the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i> is vested with the power to “reclassify land within the jurisdiction of the city”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> subject to the pertinent provisions of the Code.

In 2001, the <i>Sanggunian</i> found the relocation of the Pandacan oil depots necessary. Hence, the enactment of Ordinance No. 8027.<br><br>In 2009, when the composition of the <i>Sanggunian</i> had already changed, Ordinance No. 8187 was passed in favor of the retention of the oil depots. In 2012, again when some of the previous members were no longer re-elected, but with the Vice-Mayor still holding the same seat, and pending the resolution of these petitions, Ordinance No. 8283 was enacted to give the oil depots until the end of January 2016 within which to transfer to another site. Former Mayor Lim stood his ground and vetoed the last ordinance.<br><br>In its Comment, the 7<sup>th</sup> Council (2007-2010) alleged that the assailed Ordinance was enacted to alleviate the economic condition of its constituents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup><br><br>Expressing the same position, former Mayor Lim even went to the extent of detailing the steps<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup> he took prior to the signing of the Ordinance, if only to show his honest intention to make the right decision.<br><br>The fact remains, however, that notwithstanding that the conditions with respect to the operations of the oil depots existing prior to the enactment of Ordinance No. 8027 do not substantially differ to this day, as would later be discussed, the position of the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i> on the matter has thrice changed, largely depending on the new composition of the council and/or political affiliations. The foregoing, thus, shows that its determination of the “general welfare” of the city does not after all gear towards the protection of the people in its true sense and meaning, but is, one way or another, dependent on the personal preference of the members who sit in the council as to which particular sector among its constituents it wishes to favor.<br><br>Now that the City of Manila, through the mayor and the city councilors, has changed its view on the matter, favoring the city’s economic-related benefits, through the continued stay of the oil terminals, over the protection of the very lives and safety of its constituents, it is imperative for this Court to make a final determination on the basis of the facts on the table as to which specific right of the inhabitants of Manila should prevail. For, in this present controversy, history reveals that there is truly no such thing as “the will of Manila” insofar as the general welfare of the people is concerned.<br><br>If in sacrilege, in free translation of Angara<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup> by Justice Laurel, we say when the judiciary mediates we do not in reality nullify or invalidate an act of the Manila <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i>, but only asserts the solemn and sacred obligation assigned to the Court by the Constitution to determine conflicting claims of authority under the Constitution and to establish for the parties in an actual controversy the rights which that instrument secures and guarantees to them.<br><br><center><b>III</b><br></center><br>The measures taken by the intervenors to lend support to their position that Manila is now safe despite the presence of the oil terminals remain ineffective.

Thus:<br><br>1. Chevron claims that it, together with Shell and Petron, continues to enhance the safety and security features of the terminals. They likewise adopt fire and product spill prevention measures in accordance with the local standards set by the Bureau of Fire Protection, among others, and with the international standards of the American Petroleum Industry (“API”) and the National Fire Prevention and Safety Association (“NFPSA”); that since 1914, the oil depots had not experienced <b>“any incident beyond the ordinary risks and expectations”</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup> of the residents of Manila; and that it received a passing grade on the safety measures they installed in the facilities from the representatives of the City of Manila who conducted an ocular inspection on 22 May 2009; and<br><br>2. Referring to the old MOU entered into between the City of Manila and the DOE, on the one hand, and the oil companies, on the other, where the parties thereto conceded and acknowledged that the scale-down option for the Pandacan Terminal operations is the best alternative to the relocation of the terminals, Shell enumerates the steps taken to scale down its operations.<br><br>As to the number of main fuel tanks, the entire Pandacan Terminal has already decommissioned twenty-eight out of sixty-four tanks. Speaking for Shell alone, its LPG Spheres, which it claims is the only product that may cause explosion, was part of those decommissioned, thereby allegedly removing the danger of explosion. Safety buffer zones and linear/green parks were likewise created to separate the terminal from the nearest residential area. Shell’s portion of the oil depot is likewise allegedly equipped with the latest technology to ensure air-quality control and water-quality control, and to prevent and cope with possible oil spills with a crisis management plan in place in the event that an oil spill occurs. Finally, Shell claims that the recommendations of EQE International in its Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA) study, which it says is one of the leading independent risk assessment providers in the world and largest risk management consultancy, were sufficiently complied with; and that, on its own initiative, it adopted additional measures for the purpose, for which reason, “the individual <b>risk level</b> resulting from any incident occurring from the Pandacan Terminal, per the QRA study, is <b>twenty (20) times lower</b> compared to the individual risk level of an average working or domestic environment.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup><br><br>We are not persuaded.<br><br>The issue of whether or not the Pandacan Terminal is not a likely target of terrorist attacks has already been passed upon in G. R. No. 156052. Based on the assessment of the Committee on Housing, Resettlement and Urban Development of the City of Manila and the then position of the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup> the Court was convinced that the threat of terrorism is imminent. It remains so convinced.<br><br>Even assuming that the respondents and intervenors were correct, the very nature of the depots where millions of liters of highly flammable and highly volatile products, regardless of whether or not the composition may cause explosions, has no place in a densely populated area. Surely, any untoward incident in the oil depots, be it related to terrorism of whatever origin or otherwise, would definitely cause not only destruction to properties within and among the neighboring communities but certainly mass deaths and injuries.<br><br>With regard to the scaling down of the operations in the Pandacan Terminals, which the oil companies continue to insist to have been validated and recognized by the MOU, the Court, in G.R. No. 156052, has already put this issue to rest. It specifically declared that even assuming that the terms of the MOU and Ordinance No. 8027 were inconsistent, the resolutions ratifying the MOU gave it full force and effect only until 30 April 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup><br><br>The steps taken by the oil companies, therefore, remain insufficient to convince the Court that the dangers posed by the presence of the terminals in a thickly populated area have already been <b>completely removed</b>.<br><br>For, given that the threat sought to be prevented may strike at one point or another, no matter how remote it is as perceived by one or some, we cannot allow the right to life to be dependent on the unlikelihood of an event.

That reason, unaffected by Ordinance No. 8187, compels the affirmance of our Decision in G.R. No. 156052.<br><br>In striking down the contrary provisions of the assailed Ordinance relative to the continued stay of the oil depots, we follow the same line of reasoning used in G.R. No. 156052, to wit:<br><blockquote>Ordinance No. 8027 was enacted “for the purpose of promoting sound urban planning, ensuring health, public safety and general welfare” of the residents of Manila. The <i>Sanggunian</i> was impelled to take measures to protect the residents of Manila from catastrophic devastation in case of a terrorist attack on the Pandacan Terminals. Towards this objective, the <i>Sanggunian</i> reclassified the area defined in the ordinance from industrial to commercial.<br><br>The following facts were found by the Committee on Housing, Resettlement and Urban Development of the City of Manila which recommended the approval of the ordinance:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(1)</div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify"> the depot facilities contained 313.5 million liters of highly flammable and highly volatile products which include petroleum gas, liquefied petroleum gas, aviation fuel, diesel, gasoline, kerosene and fuel oil among others;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(2)</div></td><td><div align="justify"> the depot is open to attack through land, water or air;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(3) </div></td><td><div align="justify">it is situated in a densely populated place and near Malacañang Palace; and</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(4)</div></td><td><div align="justify"> in case of an explosion or conflagration in the depot, the fire could spread to the neighboring communities.</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>The ordinance was intended to safeguard the rights to life, security and safety of all the inhabitants of Manila and not just of a particular class. The depot is perceived, rightly or wrongly, as a representation of western interests which means that it is a terrorist target. As long as it (sic) there is such a target in their midst, the residents of Manila are not safe. It therefore became necessary to remove these terminals to dissipate the threat. According to respondent:<br><blockquote>Such a public need became apparent after the 9/11 incident which showed that what was perceived to be impossible to happen, to the most powerful country in the world at that, is actually possible. The destruction of property and the loss of thousands of lives on that fateful day became the impetus for a public need. In the aftermath of the 9/11 tragedy, the threats of terrorism continued [such] that it became imperative for governments to take measures to combat their effects.<br></blockquote>x x x x<br><br>Both law and jurisprudence support the constitutionality and validity of Ordinance No. 8027. Without a doubt, there are no impediments to its enforcement and implementation. Any delay is unfair to the inhabitants of the City of Manila and its leaders who have categorically expressed their desire for the relocation of the terminals. Their power to chart and control their own destiny and preserve their lives and safety should not be curtailed by the intervenors’ warnings of doomsday scenarios and threats of economic disorder if the ordinance is enforced.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup><br></blockquote>The same best interest of the public guides the present decision. The Pandacan oil depot remains a terrorist target even if the contents have been lessened. In the absence of any convincing reason to persuade this Court that the life, security and safety of the inhabitants of Manila are no longer put at risk by the presence of the oil depots, we hold that Ordinance No. 8187 in relation to the Pandacan Terminals is invalid and unconstitutional.<br><br>There is, therefore, no need to resolve the rest of the issues.<br><br>Neither is it necessary to discuss at length the test of police power against the assailed ordinance. Suffice it to state that the objective adopted by the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i> to promote the constituents’ general welfare in terms of economic benefits cannot override the very basic rights to life, security and safety of the people.<br><br>In. G.R. No. 156052, the Court explained:<br><blockquote>Essentially, the oil companies are fighting for their right to property. They allege that they stand to lose billions of pesos if forced to relocate. However, based on the hierarchy of constitutionally protected rights, the right to life enjoys precedence over the right to property. The reason is obvious: life is irreplaceable, property is not. When the state or LGU’s exercise of police power clashes with a few individuals’ right to property, the former should prevail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup><br></blockquote>We thus conclude with the very final words in G.R. No. 156052:<br><blockquote>On Wednesday, January 23, 2008, a defective tanker containing 2,000 liters of gasoline and 14,000 liters of diesel exploded in the middle of the street a short distance from the exit gate of the Pandacan Terminals, causing death, extensive damage and a frightening conflagration in the vicinity of the incident. Need we say anthing about what will happen if it is the estimated 162 to 211 million liters [or whatever is left of the 26 tanks] of petroleum products in the terminal complex will blow up?<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>V</b><br></div><br>As in the prequel case, we note that as early as October 2001, the oil companies signed a MOA with the DOE obliging themselves to:<br><blockquote>... undertake a comprehensive and comparative study ... [which] shall include the preparation of a Master Plan, whose aim is to determine the scope and timing of the feasible location of the Pandacan oil terminals and all associated facilities and infrastructure including government support essential for the relocation such as the necessary transportation infrastructure, land and right of way acquisition, resettlement of displaced residents and environmental and social acceptability which shall be based on mutual benefit of the Parties and the public.<br></blockquote>such that:<br><blockquote>Now that they are being compelled to discontinue their operations in the Pandacan Terminals, they cannot feign unreadiness considering that they had years to prepare for this eventuality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup><br></blockquote>On the matter of the details of the relocation, the Court gave the oil companies the following time frames for compliance:<br><blockquote>To ensure the orderly transfer, movement and relocation of assets and personnel, the intervenors Chevron Philippines Inc., Petron Corporation and Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corporation shall, within a non-extendible period of ninety (90) days, submit to the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 39, the comprehensive plan and relocation schedule which have allegedly been prepared. The presiding judge of Manila RTC, Branch 39 will monitor the strict enforcement of this resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup><br></blockquote>The periods were given in the Decision in G.R. No. 156052 which became final on 23 April 2009. Five years have passed, since then. The years of non-compliance may be excused by the swing of local legislative leads. We now stay the sway and begin a final count.<br><br>A comprehensive and well-coordinated plan within a specific time-frame shall, therefore, be observed in the relocation of the Pandacan Terminals. The oil companies shall be given a fresh non-extendible period of forty-five (45) days from notice within which to submit to the Regional Trial Court, Branch 39, Manila an updated comprehensive plan and relocation schedule. The relocation, in turn, shall be completed not later than six months from the date of their submission.<br><br>Finally, let it be underscored that after the last Manifestation filed by Shell informing this Court that respondent former Mayor Lim vetoed Ordinance No. 8283 for the second time, and was anticipating its referral to the President for the latter’s consideration, nothing was heard from any of the parties until the present petitions as to the status of the approval or disapproval of the said ordinance. As it is, the fate of the Pandacan Terminals remains dependent on this final disposition of these cases.<br><br><center><b>VI</b><br></center><br>On the matter of the failure of Atty. Gempis to immediately comply with the directives of this Court to file the Memorandum for the Vice-Mayor and the city councilors who voted in favor of the assailed Ordinance, the records do not bear proof that he received a copy of any of the resolutions pertaining to the filing of the Memorandum.<br><br>A narration of the events from his end would show, however, that he was aware of the directive issued in 2009 when he stated that “when the City Legal Officer filed its Memorandum dated 8 February 2010, [he] thought the filing of a Memorandum for the other respondent city officials could be dispensed with.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup> There was also a categorical admission that he received the later Resolution of 31 May 2011 but that he could not prepare a Memorandum defending the position of respondents vice-mayor and the city councilors who voted in favor of Ordinance No. 8187 in view of the on-going drafting of Ordinance No. 8283, which would change the position of the <i>Sanggunian</i>, if subsequently approved.<br><br>The reasons he submitted are not impressed with merit.<br><br>That he was not officially designated as the counsel for the vice-mayor and the city councilors is beside the point. As an officer of the court, he cannot feign ignorance of the fact that “a resolution of this Court is not a mere request but an order which should be complied with promptly and completely.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup> As early as 2009, he should have immediately responded and filed a Manifestation and therein set forth his reasons why he cannot represent the vice-mayor and the city councilors. And, even assuming that the 31 May 2011 Resolution was the first directive he personally received, he had no valid excuse for disregarding the same. Worse, the Court had to issue a show cause order before he finally heeded.<br><br>Atty. Gempis should “strive harder to live up to his duties of observing and maintaining the respect due to the courts, respect for law and for legal processes and of upholding the integrity and dignity of the legal profession in order to perform his responsibilities as a lawyer effectively.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[141]</sup><br><br>In <i>Sibulo v. Ilagan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[142]</sup> which involves a lawyer’s repeated failure to comply with the directives of the Court, the penalty recommended by the Integrated Bar of the Philippines was reduced from suspension to reprimand and a warning. The Court ratiocinated:<br><blockquote>Considering, however, that respondent was absolved of the administrative charge against him and is being taken to task for his intransigence and lack of respect, the Court finds that the penalty of suspension would not be warranted under the circumstances.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>To the Court’s mind, a reprimand and a warning are sufficient sanctions for respondent’s disrespectful actuations directed against the Court and the IBP. The imposition of these sanctions in the present case would be more consistent with the avowed purpose of disciplinary case, which is “not so much to punish the individual attorney as to protect the dispensation of justice by sheltering the judiciary and the public from the misconduct or inefficiency of officers of the court.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[143]</sup><br></blockquote>We consider the participation of Atty. Gempis in this case and opt to be lenient even as we reiterate the objective of protecting the dispensation of justice. We deem it sufficient to remind Atty. Gempis to be more mindful of his duty as a lawyer towards the Court.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in light of all the foregoing, Ordinance No. 8187 is hereby declared <b>UNCONSTITUTIONAL</b> and <b>INVALID</b> with respect to the continued stay of the Pandacan Oil Terminals.<br><br>The incumbent mayor of the City of Manila is hereby ordered to <b>CEASE</b> and <b>DESIST</b> from enforcing Ordinance No. 8187.

A determination by this court in an earlier petition for mandamus denying challenges to the validity of an earlier ordinance on constitutional grounds does not necessarily render such ordinance as irrepealable. That earlier ordinance may still be repealed should the local government decide to change its policy. In fact, the local government has changed its policy by enacting Ordinance No. 8283, which amends Section 2 of Ordinance No. 8187.<br><br>Ordinance No. 8187 is entitled to a presumption of constitutionality. This presumption cannot be discharged with petitioners’ broad factual allegations properly challenged by respondents. This special civil action is not the proper forum to determine questions of fact.<br><br>The spectre of terrorism and the dangers of ecological destruction are easy to foist. But our fears should not be given such privilege so as to numb us to the possibility that the facts may not be as petitioners present them. The reality is that the ordinance now in question is the product of the political will of the citizens of Manila exercised through their duly elected representatives.<br><br>The Constitution entrusts us with the power of judicial review. We do not have the power to veto an ordinance.<br><br>There are other remedies available to petitioners more adequate for their purposes. The fields of environment and health law have progressed to allow the proper causes of action to be laid in the proper forum. Proper evidence needs to be received before we conclude with finality at the level of this court that businesses of private respondents actually destroy the environment and that they do so with impunity. The precautionary principle certainly does not sanction a suspension of judicial rules with respect to evidence, reason, and legal interpretation.<br><br><center><b>The case</b><br></center><br>The Pandacan terminal is located by the banks of the Pasig River.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> It was constructed in 1914 and serves as the main artery for the storage and distribution of fuel to Metro Manila and the rest of Luzon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> It is linked to a permanent underground pipeline<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> that connects it to Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corporation’s (Shell) refinery in Tabangao and Chevron’s finished products import terminal in San Pascual, both in the province of Batangas.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Apart from the use of a pipeline, the location of the Pandacan terminal enables the delivery of fuel through barges. This is the mode of transportation utilized by Petron since its refinery is located in Limay, Bataan. When the terminal is located elsewhere, delivery of fuel may have to contend with traffic and other challenges.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>The Pandacan terminal is the focal point of this country’s fuel supply system.

Republic Act No. 6173<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> was passed in 1971, creating the Oil Industry Commission. The Oil Industry Commission was mandated to perform the following:<br><blockquote>SEC. 3. <b><i>Declaration of Policy and Purposes. -</i></b> . . . .<br><blockquote>(a) To assure that the country shall have a proper adequate and continuous supply of crude oil and refined petroleum products under the most economic and competitive terms possible considering all available sources of supply;<br><br>(b) To assure that the petroleum industry, as a business vital to the national interest, operates under conditions of orderly and economic competition;<br><br>(c) To assure the public of reasonable prices for petroleum products considering the international price levels of crude oil and petroleum products and after allowing for proper and reasonable cost of importing, shipping, transporting, processing, refining, storing, distributing, marketing, and selling crude oil and petroleum products in the Philippines, and for a fair and reasonable return; and to prevent collusive practices in the industry, particularly as to prices[.]</blockquote></blockquote>In 1977, the Oil Industry Commission was replaced by the Department of Energy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> This department was created to make certain that there is an adequate supply of energy for the country.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Additional functions were granted to the Department of Energy upon the passage of Republic Act No. 8479.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>On October 12, 2001, the Department of Energy entered into a memorandum of agreement with Chevron, Shell, and Petron to address the safety concerns brought about by the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States.

In case of doubt in the sufficiency of proof establishing unconstitutionality, the Court must sustain legislation because “to invalidate [a law] based on . . . baseless supposition is an affront to the wisdom not only of the legislature that passed it but also of the executive which approved it.” This presumption of constitutionality can be overcome only by the clearest showing that there was indeed an infraction of the Constitution, and only when such a conclusion is reached by the required majority may the Court pronounce, in the discharge of the duty it cannot escape, that the challenged act must be struck down.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br></blockquote>In <i>Hon.

A long line of decisions including <i>City of Manila</i> has held that for an ordinance to be valid, it must not only be within the corporate powers of the local government unit to enact and pass according to the procedure prescribed by law, it must also conform to the following substantive requirements: (1) must not contravene the Constitution or any statute; (2) must not be unfair or oppressive; (3) must not be partial or discriminatory; (4) must not prohibit but may regulate trade; (5) must be general and consistent with public policy; and (6) must not be unreasonable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> (Citation omitted)<br></blockquote>The reason for the first requirement — that an ordinance should not contravene the Constitution or any statute — was explained in <i>City of Manila v.

The Ordinance must satisfy two requirements: it must pass muster under the test of constitutionality and the test of consistency with the prevailing laws. That ordinances should be constitutional uphold the principle of the supremacy of the Constitution. The requirement that the enactment must not violate existing law gives stress to the precept that local government units are able to legislate only by virtue of their derivative legislative power, a delegation of legislative power from the national legislature. The delegate cannot be superior to the principal or exercise powers higher than those of the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>In relation to the constitutional requirement of due process, we further clarified that:<br><blockquote>To successfully invoke the exercise of police power as the rationale for the enactment of an ordinance and to free it from the imputation of constitutional infirmity, two tests have been used by the Court – the rational relationship test and the strict scrutiny test:<br><blockquote>We ourselves have often applied the rational basis test mainly in analysis of equal protection challenges. Using the rational basis examination, laws or ordinances are upheld if they rationally further a legitimate governmental interest. Under intermediate review, governmental interest is extensively examined and the availability of less restrictive measures is considered. Applying strict scrutiny, the focus is on the presence of compelling, rather than substantial, governmental interest and on the absence of less restrictive means for achieving that interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> (Citation omitted)<br></blockquote></blockquote>We then recalled the rational relationship test in this manner:<br><blockquote>As with the State, local governments may be considered as having properly exercised their police power only if the following requisites are met: (1) the interests of the public generally, as distinguished from those of a particular class, require its exercise and (2) the means employed are reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of the purpose and not unduly oppressive upon individuals.

Thus, intervenor Shell states:<br><blockquote>It bears noting that while petroleum refineries and oil depots are classified as “highly pollutive/extremely hazardous” industries, they are nonetheless allowable classifications even under the Model Zoning Ordinance. To reiterate, contrary to petitioners’ simplistic and misleading argument, such classification does not mean that highly essential industries which are classified as “highly pollutive/extremely hazardous” have a license to cause pollution. It only recognizes that these industries have the possibility to cause pollution if no environmental safeguards and/or standards are in place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br></blockquote>Under Ordinance 8187, medium industrial zones would allow the operation of “pollutive/hazardous industries” while heavy industrial zones would allow the operation of “highly pollutive/non-hazardous industries”; “highly pollutive/hazardous industries”; “highly pollutive/extremely hazardous industries”; “pollutive/extremely hazardous industries”; and “non-pollutive/extremely hazardous industries.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> However, these are mere classifications that should not, in any way, lead to the conclusion that the industries classified under any of these categories are automatically polluters.<br><br>The arguments raised by petitioners are hypothetical. No convincing evidence was presented to show why oil depots are inherently risky or why oil depots are targets of terrorist attacks. The examples of fire incidents in other fuel facilities located in Puerto Rico and India<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> are insufficient to give us a scientific basis for concluding that the risks of simply having an oil depot are unmanageably high. The examples do not relate to the number of oil depots that have operated continuously without any safety problems.<br><br>To decide a controversy on the basis of hypothetical facts would have the effect of barring litigation between real parties with real causes of action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><br><center><b>III<br><br>The earlier case of<br><i>Social Justice Society (SJS), et al. v.

Petitioner SJS filed a petition for prohibition. Petitioner Mayor Atienza now files a petition for prohibition, mandamus and certiorari. The earlier case sought to enforce an ordinance. SJS, in this case, seeks to enjoin the enforcement of an ordinance because:<br><blockquote>[T]he same is illegal and unconstitutional, thus, without force and effect. Further, it is a circumvention of this Honorable Court’s decision on [sic] GR 156052 which mandates the enforcement of Ordinance No. 8027 by the mayor of the City of Manila which effectively removes the Pandacan oil depot.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup><br></blockquote>Clearly, the decision in <i>Social Justice Society (SJS), et al. v. Hon. Atienza, Jr.</i> dealt with Ordinance No. 8027. This petition now deals with Ordinance No. 8187. The subject matter and the issues are totally different.<br><br><b>No allegation and clear basis<br>for a finding that a law was violated in<br>enacting the ordinance</b><br><br>The petition filed by petitioner SJS in this case and its memorandum are extraordinary in that these are bereft of any substantial argument that clearly shows that Ordinance No. 8187 violates any law. The closest mention of any law is Section 458 of the Local Government Code of 1991 that grants the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i> of Manila the power to enact ordinances for the general welfare.<br><br>Petitioner SJS recommends that we rule that:<br><blockquote>“General welfare” means the enjoyment of health and the common blessings of life, and <i>this could <b><u>only</u></b> be achieved if there would be [a] guarantee against risk in health and the common blessings of life of the people</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Explaining its argument that general welfare can only be present if there is absolutely no risk to health, petitioner SJS continues to cite <i>Villanueva v. Castañeda</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> where this court held that a <i>talipapa</i> (small public market) can endanger public health and public safety.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> Thus, in the sole view of petitioner SJS:<br><blockquote>If this Honorable Court could consider a <i>talipapa</i> to be hazardous to public health and safety, there is more reason for this Honorable Court to consider the Pandacan oil depot to be hazardous to the community surrounding it. The comparison may not be apple to apple and orange to orange but the logic and common sense behind this comparison is to point out the far greater danger that an oil depot may bring compared to that of a <i>talipapa</i>. The detrimental impact of the mere presence of the oil depot in the Pandacan community outweighs the beneficial impact that it gives, if it has any.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup><br></blockquote>Such arguments are superficially seducing but dangerous because these ask that legal decisions be the outcome of homespun fear rather than based on more critical analysis.<br><br>The fallacy of the argument of petitioner SJS is obvious.<br><br>To begin with, not all <i>talipapa</i> are hazardous to public health and safety. In the case cited by petitioner SJS, the <i>talipapa</i> was “in the vicinity of the public market of San Fernando, Pampanga, along Mercado Street, a strip of land measuring 12 by 77 meters on which stands a conglomeration of vendors stalls.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> The vendors wanted to assert their right to remain in the area due to a previous authorization by the municipal government. The municipal government denied this right, insisting on the demolition of their structures because they were illegal constructions on public property. In deciding to uphold the municipal government, this court noted that the occupants proliferated under filthy conditions that added to the basis of the municipal government to assert its powers over the public space.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> That case certainly did not denigrate all <i>talipapa</i>. Its reiteration of the findings of the municipal government certainly only applied to that specific set of vendor stalls.<br><br>Not all <i>talipapa</i> are the same. Not all are hazardous to public health and safety. It depends on the condition of the <i>talipapa</i>. These conditions can be found only upon the presentation of evidence in the proper judicial forum. Only after the presentation of evidence can the degree of risk and hazard be assessed in relation to the standards contained in law and corresponding regulations. Only after all these can courts rule whether to remove or demolish a <i>talipapa</i>.<br><br>The same considerations apply to oil depots. In this case, upon reassessing the facts and weighing the risks in relation to the necessity of the Pandacan oil depot, the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i> of Manila found it proper to reverse its policy through a validly issued ordinance. Except for superficial arguments based on fallacies masquerading as common sense, petitioners here do not present us with facts that can be taken judicial notice of. Rather, petitioners present to us the same city council report that was submitted for the passage of Ordinance No. 8027, and not the report that served as basis for Ordinance No. 8187, which is the subject of this case.<br><br>The failure to discharge the burden of clearly showing the illegality of the ordinance is enough to dismiss the petition. However, the static view of the world presented by petitioners merits further attention.<br><br>The challenges and controversies surrounding the passage of the various ordinances relating to the Pandacan oil depot certainly also impel the corporations and the local government officials to install measures to further assure its public. We cannot accept the implied assumption of the petitioners that nothing in relation to the Pandacan oil depot has changed since this court’s decision and resolution in the earlier case of Social Justice <i>Society (SJS), et al. v. Hon. Atienza, Jr.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup><br><br>For instance, the ponencia in <i>Social Justice Society (SJS), et al. v. Hon. Atienza, Jr.</i> (2008 resolution) pointed out that:<br><blockquote>The ordinance [Ordinance No. 8027] was intended to safeguard the rights to life, security and safety of all the inhabitants of Manila and not just of a particular class. The depot is perceived, rightly or wrongly, as a representation of western interests which means that it is a terrorist target. As long as there is such a target in their midst, the residents of Manila are not safe. It therefore became necessary to remove these terminals to dissipate the threat. According to respondent:<br><blockquote>Such a public need became apparent after the 9/11 incident which showed that what was perceived to be impossible to happen, to the most powerful country in the world at that, is actually possible. The destruction of property and the loss of thousand of lives on that fateful day became the impetus for a public need. In the aftermath of the 9/11 tragedy, the threats of terrorism continued [such] that it became imperative for governments to take measures to combat their effects.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote>In this petition, SJS repeats the same argument with the same certainty that the Pandacan terminal is a target of terrorist attacks because it represents Western interest in the Philippines. In its memorandum, SJS randomly listed acts of terrorism in the Philippines and in Asia. In its own enumeration, bombs attributed to terrorists exploded: in cars near the official residence of ambassadors, on a packed parking deck beneath a stock exchange building, inside a luggage, outside a bar, in a bus terminal, in an embassy, in hotels, and inside a light rail transit coach.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup><br><br>In the Philippines, terrorists have targeted government buildings, public utility buses, fastfood outlet, beach resort, markets, and churches.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> At the international level, terrorists have chosen trains, churches, mosques and other places where the faithful gather, police stations, hotels, embassies, and markets.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> Not once has an oil depot been attacked.<br><br>“Western interests,” if such concept can be accepted despite its obvious ambiguity and potential to encompass much of modern life, are simply too omnipresent. To accept SJS’ theory would mean that it would be illegal and unconstitutional not to close down or isolate cars, residences of ambassadors, parking buildings, lounges, bars, restaurants, bus terminals, embassy buildings, hotels, and light rail transit coaches.<br><br>The panic does not end there. SJS expands even further to almost everything. Thus:<br><blockquote>All of us should not forget the so-called Rizal Day bombings where innocent ordinary people were targeted by J[emaah] I[slamiyah] on Light Rail Transit coaches which had claimed many lives. The Light Rail Transit did not represent Western interest and had no symbolic value as far as Western target is concerned and yet it was struck by those heartless terrorists.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup><br></blockquote>Risks are inherent in all human activity. The questions properly addressed to policy makers are whether the risks are properly proven and understood, the measures that are proposed are sufficient to mitigate the risks in relation to the beneficial effects or objective of the activity, and whether the measures can be implemented given the institutions in place and the resources available. Governance cannot proceed from imagined fears. Therefore, insofar as judicial review is concerned, it is not our duty to second-guess political branches or local government units. They are in a better position to understand risks, decide on measures, and pursue these measures’ implementation.<br><br><b>Doctrine in <i>Social Justice Society<br>(SJS), et al. v. Hon.

The mere fact that the ordinance is alleged to be unconstitutional or invalid will not entitle a party to have its enforcement enjoined. The presumption is all in favor of validity. The reason for this is obvious:<br><br>The action of the elected representatives of the people cannot be lightly set aside. The councilors must, in the very nature of things, be familiar with the necessities of their particular municipality and with all the facts and circumstances which surround the subject and necessitate action. The local legislative body, by enacting the ordinance, has in effect given notice that the regulations are essential to the well being of the people . . . The Judiciary should not lightly set aside legislative action when there is not a clear invasion of personal or property rights under the guise of police regulation.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x x x&nbsp; x x x<br></div><br>[Courts] accord the presumption of constitutionality to legislative enactments, not only because the legislature is presumed to abide by the Constitution but also because the judiciary[,] in the determination of actual cases and controversies[,] must reflect the wisdom and justice of the people as expressed through their representatives in the executive and legislative departments of the government.<br><br>The oil companies argue that this presumption must be set aside when the invalidity or unreasonableness appears on the face of the ordinance itself. We see no reason to set aside the presumption. The ordinance, on its face, does not at all appear to be unconstitutional. It reclassified the subject area from industrial to commercial. <i>Prima facie</i>, this power is within the power of municipal corporations:<br><br>The power of municipal corporations to divide their territory into industrial, commercial and residential zones is recognized in almost all jurisdictions inasmuch as it is derived from the police power itself and is exercised for the protection and benefit of their inhabitants.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x x x&nbsp; x x x<br></div><br>There can be no doubt that the City of Manila has the power to divide its territory into residential and industrial zones, and to prescribe that offensive and unwholesome trades and occupations are to be established exclusively in the latter zone.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x x x&nbsp; x x x<br></div><br>Likewise, it cannot be denied that the City of Manila has the authority, derived from the police power, of forbidding the appellant to continue the manufacture of <i>toyo</i> in the zone where it is now situated, which has been declared residential....<br><br>Courts will not invalidate an ordinance unless it clearly appears that it is unconstitutional.

Their allowance promotes an unhealthy stasis in the legislative front and dissuades dynamic democratic impetus that may be responsive to the times. As Senior Associate Justice Reynato S.

Change is the predicate of progress and we should not fear change.”<br><br><i>Moreover, it would be noxious anathema to democratic principles for a legislative body to have the ability to bind the actions of future legislative body, considering that both assemblies are regarded with equal footing, exercising as they do the same plenary powers</i>.

While we have concurrent jurisdiction with the RTCs and the Court of Appeals to issue writs of certiorari, this concurrence is not to be taken as an unrestrained freedom of choice as to which court the application for the writ will be directed. There is after all a hierarchy of courts. That hierarchy is determinative of the venue of appeals and should also serve as a general determinant of the appropriate forum for petitions for the extraordinary writs. This Court is a court of last resort and must so remain if it is to satisfactorily perform the functions assigned to it by the Constitution and immemorial tradition.

Like all rules, they are required to be followed except only for the most persuasive of reasons when they may be relaxed to relieve a litigant of an injustice not commensurate with the degree of his thoughtlessness in not complying with the procedure prescribed. Procedural law has its own rationale in the orderly administration of justice, namely, to ensure the effective enforcement of substantive rights by providing for a system that obviates arbitrariness, caprice, despotism or whimsicality in the settlement of disputes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup><br></blockquote><b>Exceptions to the doctrine<br>of hierarchy of courts</b><br><br>Nevertheless, this court has, from time to time, relaxed its rules and allowed the direct filing of petitions before it.

Given the sparseness of our resources, the capacity of courts to render efficient judicial service to our people is severely limited. For courts to indiscriminately open their doors to <i>all</i> types of suits and suitors is for them to unduly overburden their dockets, and ultimately render themselves ineffective dispensers of justice. To be sure, this is an evil that clearly confronts our judiciary today.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup><br></blockquote>“Rights which are legally demandable and enforceable” means that the party who seeks relief from this court must suffer, or is in imminent danger of suffering, an injury. In <i>Tolentino v. COMELEC</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup> this court held that “direct injury” may be determined using the following guidelines:<br><blockquote>Thus, generally, a party will be allowed to litigate only when (1) he can show that he has personally suffered some actual or threatened injury because of the allegedly illegal conduct of the government; (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action; and (3) the injury is likely to be redressed by a favorable action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup><br></blockquote>In a previous case,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup> this court held that SJS had no standing to file a petition for declaratory relief before the Regional Trial Court of Manila on the following grounds:<br><blockquote><i>First</i>, parties suing as taxpayers must specifically prove that they have sufficient interest in preventing the illegal expenditure of money raised by taxation. A taxpayer’s action may be properly brought only when there is an exercise by Congress of its taxing or spending power. In the present case, there is no allegation, whether express or implied, that taxpayers’ money is being illegally disbursed.<br><br><i>Second</i>, there was no showing in the Petition for Declaratory Relief that SJS as a political party or its members as registered voters would be adversely affected by the alleged acts of the respondents below, if the question at issue was not resolved. There was no allegation that SJS had suffered or would be deprived of votes due to the acts imputed to the said respondents. Neither did it allege that any of its members would be denied the right of suffrage or the privilege to be voted for a public office they are seeking.<br><br><i>Finally</i>, the allegedly keen interest of its “thousands of members who are citizens-taxpayers-registered voters” is too general and beyond the contemplation of the standards set by our jurisprudence. Not only is the presumed interest impersonal in character; it is likewise too vague, highly speculative and uncertain to satisfy the requirement of standing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>This should have guided SJS in determining whether it had the standing to file the petition for prohibition before this court. Unfortunately, SJS did not heed this court’s advice.<br><br><b>Transcendental importance</b><br><br>Petitioners try to justify its direct recourse to this court by arguing that the issues raised in their petitions are of “transcendental importance.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup><br><br>To determine if an issue is of transcendental importance, this court is guided by the parameters set forth in <i>Francisco v.

Thus, we will also dispose of this issue here. The parties were after all given ample opportunity to present and argue their respective positions. By so doing, we will do away with the delays concomitant with litigation and completely adjudicate an issue which will most likely reach us anyway as the final arbiter of all legal disputes.<br></blockquote>The foregoing was an undeniable recognition by this Honorable Court of the importance of this case as it mentioned “its impact on public interest” that justified its taking cognizance of the original petition because the issue would most likely reach it anyway “as the final arbiter of all legal disputes.” Thus, petitioners need not stretch its argumentation to convince this Honorable Court about the transcendental importance of this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[141]</sup><br></blockquote>For this court to brush aside the rules of procedure in view of the “transcendental importance” of a case, petitioners must be able to show that “the imminence and clarity of the threat to fundamental constitutional rights outweigh the necessity for prudence.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[142]</sup> This they failed to do.<br><br><center><b>VII<br><br>There are other remedies available</b><br></center><br>Respondents and intervenors point out that more appropriate remedies are available to petitioners.
