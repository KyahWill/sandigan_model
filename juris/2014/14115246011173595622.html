Case No. 2001-5446, for Crim. Case No. [2001-]5447 and for Crim. Case No. 2001-5448 and to pay the heirs of Edgardo Aringo, Benjamin Aringo and Carlito Lasala as civil indemnity, at P50,000.00 each, jointly and severally the total amount of ONE HUNDRED FIFTY [THOUSAND] (P150,000.00) Pesos, also the amount of Ninety Thousand (P90,000.00) Pesos, at P30,000.00 each victim, as moral damages without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency and to pay the costs.<br><br>The accused being detained, their detention shall be credited in full in the service of their sentence.<br><br>The case against accused Renato Las Piñas, Armando Las Piñas, Gilberto Las Piñas, Freddie Las Piñas, and Salvador Las Piñas are hereby ordered archived[.] Let issue an alias warrant of arrest of them and the same be coursed thru the Central, Regional, Provincial and Local PNP Command for service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></blockquote><br>The accused-appellants appealed the foregoing decisions to the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; They prayed for their acquittal in the Murder cases; and either a similar acquittal in the Frustrated Murder case, or a downgrading of the charge to Attempted Murder.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br><center><b><i>The Court of Appeals Decision</i></b><br></center><br>In its consolidated<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> December 22, 2009 Decision, the Court of Appeals affirmed the decisions of RTC-Br. 52 and Br. 53, viz:<br><br><blockquote>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the decisions appealed from are affirmed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></blockquote><br>The Court of Appeals did not disturb both trial courts’ rulings since the convictions of the accused-appellants for frustrated murder and three counts of murder were based on the narration of a credible eyewitness, which was independently assessed by the two trial courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Particularly, in sustaining that the acts committed against Roger amounted to frustrated murder, the Court of Appeals held that downgrading the charge to attempted murder instead was not supported by expert medical opinion.&nbsp; On the contrary, the attending physician explained that the injuries sustained by Roger would have led to his death if his injuries were neglected or medically unattended.<br><br>And in an attempt to discredit Roger’s eyewitness account pertaining to the murder of Edgardo, Benjamin and Carlito, the accused-appellants alleged that he (Roger) did not really see what transpired as his left eye was blinded when the bullet that entered his right cheek eventually ended behind his left eye.&nbsp; But the Court of Appeals discredited said argument on account of the testimony of Dr. Lopez, Roger’s attending physician, that Roger’s right eye remained visually unimpaired.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>This case is now before the Court in view of the Notice of Appeal interposed by the accused-appellants from the consolidated Decision of the Court of Appeals.<br><br><center><b><i>The Court’s Decision</i></b><br></center><br>The parties waived the filing of supplemental briefs and adopted their Appeal Briefs earlier filed with the Court of Appeals.<br><br>The accused-appellants pray for the reversal of the judgment of conviction in the criminal cases on the following assignment of errors:&nbsp; (<i>i</i>) that the trial court gravely erred in finding the accused-appellants guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder despite the insufficiency of evidence for the prosecution; (<i>ii</i>) granting <i>arguendo</i>, that the accused-appellants committed an offense, they can only be held liable for attempted murder; and (<i>iii</i>) that the trial court gravely erred in not giving credence to the accused-appellants’ defense of alibi.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>In essence, the accused-appellants attack the consolidated disposition of the Court of Appeals affirming their conviction for frustrated murder and three counts of murder on the ground that the prosecution failed to discharge its function of proving their guilt beyond reasonable doubt.&nbsp; They make an issue out of Roger’s delay in reporting the crimes to the authorities, and his supposed physical inability to observe the entire commission of the crimes.&nbsp; In a nutshell, they raise reasonable doubt in view of the issues identified by the accused-appellants that hinge on the credibility of Roger as an eyewitness.<br><br>The appeal fails.<br><br>After a review of the records, the Court sustains the conviction of the accused-appellants for Frustrated Murder and three counts of Murder.<br><br>The age-old rule is that the task of assigning values to the testimonies of witnesses on the witness stand and weighing their credibility is best left to the trial court which forms its first-hand impressions as a witness testifies before it. It is, thus, no surprise that findings and conclusions of trial courts on the credibility of witnesses enjoy, as a rule, a badge of respect, for trial courts have the advantage of observing the demeanor of witnesses as they testify.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>With respect to this case, the Court nevertheless carefully scrutinized the records but found no indication that the trial and the appellate courts overlooked or failed to appreciate facts that, if considered, would change the outcome of this case.&nbsp; The two trial courts and the Court of Appeals did not err in giving credence to the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, particularly of Roger who was an eyewitness to the crime and was himself a victim of the shooting.<br><br>Roger’s testimony does not suffer from any serious and material inconsistency that could possibly detract from his credibility.&nbsp; The accused-appellants were directly identified by Roger as three of the eight perpetrators of the crimes charged. Roger saw the shooting of Edgardo, Benjamin and Carlito, and was categorical and frank in his testimony. His testimony was the same with respect to his own experience at the hands of the other accused.&nbsp; From his direct and straightforward testimony, there is no doubt as to the identity of the culprits, viz:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">[Direct

With treachery, taking advantage of superior strength, with the aid of armed men, or employing means to weaken the defense or of means or persons to insure or afford impunity[.]</blockquote><br>To successfully prosecute the crime of murder, the following elements must be established:&nbsp; (1) that a person was killed; (2) that the accused killed him or her; (3) that the killing was attended by any of the qualifying circumstances mentioned in Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code; and (4) that the killing is not parricide or infanticide.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>In this case, the prosecution was able to clearly establish that (<b>1</b>) Edgardo, Benjamin and Carlito were shot and killed; (<b>2</b>) the accused-appellants were three of the eight perpetrators who killed them; (<b>3</b>) Edgardo, Benjamin and Carlito’s killing was attended by the qualifying circumstance of treachery as testified to by prosecution eyewitness, Roger; and (<b>4</b>) the killing of Edgardo, Benjamin and Carlito were neither parricide nor infanticide.<br><br>Paragraph 16, Article 14 of the Revised Penal Code defines treachery as the direct employment of means, methods, or forms in the execution of the crime against persons which tend directly and specially to insure its execution, without risk to the offender arising from the defense which the offended party might make.&nbsp; The essence of treachery is that the attack is deliberate and without warning, done in a swift and unexpected way, affording the hapless, unarmed and unsuspecting victim no chance to resist or escape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>&nbsp; In order for treachery to be properly appreciated, two elements must be present:&nbsp; (1) at the time of the attack, the victim was not in a position to defend himself; and (2) the accused consciously and deliberately adopted the particular means, methods, or forms of attack employed by him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>&nbsp; These elements are extant in the facts of this case and as testified to by Roger above-quoted.<br><br>To emphasize, the victims, Roger, Edgardo, Benjamin and Carlito, were caught off guard when the accused, including the accused-appellants, in the dead of night, arrived at the fishpen and climbed the same, and without warning, opened fire at the sleeping/resting victims to disable them.&nbsp; Upon disabling the victims, the accused and the accused-appellants continued shooting at the victims – accused Armando and accused-appellant Rolando shot Edgardo and Carlito; accused-appellants Jimmy and Merwin and accused Freddie shot Benjamin; and accused Renato, Salvador and Gilberto shot Roger. Accused Armando even slashed Edgardo’s throat after shooting him and threw his body out to the sea<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> – the stealth, swiftness and methodical manner by which the attack was carried out gave the four victims no chance at all to evade the bullets and defend themselves from the unexpected onslaught.&nbsp; Thus, there is no denying that the collective acts of the accused and the accused-appellants reek of treachery.<br><br><i><u>Conspiracy</u></i><br><br>Article 8 of the Revised Penal Code states that “conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>&nbsp; It does not need to be proven by direct evidence and may be inferred from the conduct – before, during, and after the commission of the crime – indicative of a joint purpose, concerted action, and concurrence of sentiments as in conspiracy. In conspiracy, the act of one is the act of all.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>That there was conspiracy among the accused and accused-appellants is a matter not in issue.&nbsp; Both trial courts and the Court of Appeals deduced the conspiracy among the accused/accused-appellants from the mode and manner in which they perpetrated the killings.&nbsp; This Court is satisfied that their deduction was warranted.&nbsp; Proof of the actual agreement to commit the crime need not be direct because conspiracy may be implied or inferred from their conduct – before, during, and after the commission of the crime – indicative of a joint purpose, concerted action, and concurrence of sentiments as in conspiracy.&nbsp; In this case, all the accused/accused-appellants were convincingly shown to have acted in concert to achieve a common purpose of assaulting their unarmed victims with their guns.&nbsp; Their acting in concert was manifest not only from their going together to the fishpen located offshore on board the same boat, but also from their joint attack commenced simultaneously, firing successive shots at the four victims and immediately followed by clambering up the platform and resuming their shooting of Roger, Edgardo, Benjamin and Carlito. It was also significant that they fled together on board the boat that they arrived in as soon as they had achieved their common purpose.&nbsp; Their conduct – before, during, and after the commission of the crime – indicated a joint purpose, concerted action, and concurrence of sentiments.&nbsp; Hence, conspiracy attended the commission of the crimes.<br><br>As to the Information docketed as Criminal Case No. 2001-5445, the accused-appellants were indicted with the crime of <u>Frustrated Murder</u> for shooting Roger, which was also attended by treachery, punished by Article 250 also of the Revised Penal Code, in relation to Article 248 thereof, reading:<br><br><blockquote>Article 250. <i>Penalty for frustrated parricide, murder or homicide.</i> – The courts, in view of the facts of the case, may impose upon the person guilty of the frustrated crime of parricide, murder or homicide, defined and penalized in the preceding articles, a penalty lower by one degree than that which should be imposed under the provisions of Article 50.</blockquote><br>In the same way that the murder was proved, to establish frustrated murder, the prosecution must show that the accused performed all the acts of execution which would kill the victim, but which, nevertheless, did not produce it by reason of causes independent of the offender’s will.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>&nbsp; Here, the only survivor, Roger, recounted that accused Renato, Salvador and Gilberto shot him on the face, chest and buttock using a .38 gun and then left him for dead.&nbsp; Had it not been for the timely medical treatment of his injuries, they would have been fatal.

In view of the preceding discussion, there is no more reason to entertain the issue raised by the accused-appellants that the charge of frustrated murder be downgraded to attempted murder.<br><br>And although only the three accused-appellants were apprehended, they shall be held liable for the acts of their five other co-accused since the prosecution similarly established conspiracy with respect to the frustrated murder case – the act of one is the act of all.<br><br><center><b><i>Defenses of denial and alibi</i></b><br></center><br>The twin defenses of denial and alibi raised by the accused-appellants must fail in light of the positive identification made by one of their victims, Roger.&nbsp; Alibi and denial are inherently weak defenses and must be brushed aside when the prosecution has sufficiently and positively ascertained the identity of the accused as in this case.&nbsp; It is also axiomatic that positive testimony prevails over negative testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup>&nbsp; The accused-appellants’ alibis that they were at different places at the time of the shooting, and that family members and or their friends vouched for their whereabouts are negative and self-serving assertions and cannot not be given more evidentiary value vis-à-vis the affirmative testimony of a credible witness.&nbsp; The accused-appellants and Roger, at one point, resided in the same <i>barangay</i> and, are, therefore, familiar with one another.&nbsp; Therefore, Roger could not have been mistaken on the accused-appellants’ identity, including the five other accused who remained at large.<br><br>Further, it has been held that for the defense of alibi to prosper, the accused must prove the following:&nbsp; (<i>i</i>) that he was present at another place at the time of the perpetration of the crime; and (<i>ii</i>) that it was physically impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime during its commission.&nbsp; Physical impossibility involves the distance and the facility of access between the crime scene and the location of the accused when the crime was committed.&nbsp; The accused must demonstrate that he was so far away and could not have been physically present at the crime scene and its immediate vicinity when the crime was committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>&nbsp; Here, the accused-appellants utterly failed to satisfy the above-quoted requirements. As held by the Court of Appeals, “[j]udicial notice was taken of the fact that Barangay Bitan-o in Sorsogon City where the accused claimed they were at the time of the shooting and the area of the sea adjacent to the municipality of Castilla where the incident took place are neighboring sites that can be negotiated with the use of a banca in one hour or less.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup>&nbsp; Certainly, the distance was not too far as to preclude the presence of accused-appellants at the fishpen, and/or for them to slip away from where they were supposed to be, unnoticed.<br><br>Finally, the defense failed to show any ill motive on the part of the prosecution’s witnesses to discredit their testimonies.&nbsp; Absent any reason or motive for a prosecution witness to perjure himself, the logical conclusion is that no such motive exists, and his testimony is, thus, worthy of full faith and credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br><u><i>The Penalties</i></u><br><br>From the foregoing discussion, the Court is convinced beyond reasonable doubt that the accused-appellants are guilty of three counts of Murder and Frustrated Murder.<br><br>For Criminal Case Nos. 2001-5446, 2001-5447 and 2001-5448 (for Murder), the prosecution successfully established the presence of the qualifying circumstance of treachery in the killing of Edgardo, Benjamin and Carlito.&nbsp; The crime of murder qualified by treachery is penalized under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659, with <i>reclusion perpetua </i>to death.&nbsp; There being no other mitigating or aggravating circumstance in the commission of the felony, the accused-appellants were correctly meted the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua, </i>for each separate count of Murder, conformably to Article 63(2) of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>On the other hand, for Criminal Case No. 2001-5445 (for Frustrated Murder), the indeterminate penalty imposed by the trial court in this case is<i> eight (8) years and one (1) day of prision mayor, as <b>minimum,</b> to twelve (12) years, five (5) months and eleven (11) days of reclusion temporal, as <b>maximum.</b></i>&nbsp; The period is incorrect in so far as the maximum penalty is concerned.<br><br>Article 61, paragraph 2 of the Revised Penal Code provides that the penalty of frustrated murder is one degree lower than<i> reclusion perpetua </i>to death, which is<i> reclusion temporal.</i> <i>Reclusion temporal</i> has a range of twelve (12) years and one (1) day to twenty (20) years.&nbsp; There being no modifying circumstance in the commission of the frustrated murder and applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the <b>maximum</b> of the indeterminate penalty should be taken from reclusion temporal in its <i>medium period</i>, and the <b>minimum</b> of the indeterminate penalty shall be taken from the <i>full range of prision mayor</i>, which is one degree lower than<i> reclusion temporal,</i> ranging from six (6) years and one (1) day to twelve (12) years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup>&nbsp; Since the RTC imposed the minimum term of <b>8 years and 1 day</b> of <i>prision mayor,</i> which is correctly within the range of<i> prision mayor </i>under the Revised Penal Code, the Court will no longer disturb the minimum term fixed.&nbsp; However, the maximum term must be taken from <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its medium period, or <b>fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months.</b><br><br><u><i>The Proper Indemnities</i></u><br><br>In Criminal Case Nos. 2001-5446 to 5448 (for three counts of Murder), the RTC awarded in each case the amounts of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity and P30,000.00 as moral damages to the victims’ heirs. But to conform to recent jurisprudence, the foregoing awards must be raised as follows: P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, and another P75,000.00 as moral damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup>&nbsp; The Court notes, however, that both the RTC and the Court of Appeals overlooked the award of exemplary damages.&nbsp; When a crime is committed with an aggravating circumstance either as qualifying or generic, an award of exemplary damages is justified under Article 2230 of the Civil Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, conformably with the above, the legal heirs of each victim are also entitled to an award of exemplary damages in the amount of P30,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>And in Criminal Case No. 2001-5445 (for Furstrated Murder) the RTC awarded to Roger P25,000.00 as moral damages.&nbsp; But current jurisprudence dictates that the same must be increased to P40,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup>&nbsp; Moreover, Roger is also entitled to exemplary damages in the amount of P20,000.00, in view of the presence of treachery as above reasoned.<br><br>Further, an interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum shall be imposed on all the damages awarded, to earn from the date of the finality of this judgment until fully paid, in line with prevailing jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the Court of Appeals consolidated Decision dated December 22, 2009 in CA-G.R.
