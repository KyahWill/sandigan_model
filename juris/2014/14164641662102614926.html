				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Corporate representatives may be compelled to submit to arbitration proceedings pursuant to a contract entered into by the corporation they represent if there are allegations of bad faith or malice in their acts representing the corporation.<br><br>This is a Rule 45 petition, assailing the Court of Appeals' May 11, 2006 decision and October 5, 2006 resolution. The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's decision holding that petitioners, as directors, should submit themselves as parties to the arbitration proceedings between BF Corporation and Shangri-La Properties, Inc. (Shangri-La).<br><br>In 1993, BF Corporation filed a collection complaint with the Regional Trial Court against Shangri-La and the members of its board of directors: Alfredo C. Ramos, Rufo B.

Consequently, if [they were] excluded as parties in the arbitration proceedings and an arbitral award is rendered, holding [Shangri-La] and its board of directors jointly and solidarity liable to private respondent BF Corporation, a problem will arise, i.e., whether petitioners will be bound by such arbitral award, and this will prevent complete determination of the issues and resolution of the controversy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></blockquote><br>The Court of Appeals further ruled that "excluding petitioners in the arbitration proceedings . . . would be contrary to the policy against multiplicity of suits."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of the Court of Appeals' decision reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b><i>DISMISSED</i></b>.

In <i>De la Camara v. Hon.

Arbitration allows the parties to avoid litigation and settle disputes amicably and more expeditiously by themselves and through their choice of arbitrators.<br><br>The policy in favor of arbitration has been affirmed in our Civil Code,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> which was approved as early as 1949. It was later institutionalized by the approval of Republic Act No. 876,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> which expressly authorized, made valid, enforceable, and irrevocable parties' decision to submit their controversies, including incidental issues, to arbitration. This court recognized this policy in <i>Eastboard Navigation, Ltd. v. Ysmael and Company, Inc</i>.:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br><blockquote>As a corollary to the question regarding the existence of an arbitration agreement, defendant raises the issue that, even if it be granted that it agreed to submit its dispute with plaintiff to arbitration, said agreement is void and without effect for it amounts to removing said dispute from the jurisdiction of the courts in which the parties are domiciled or where the dispute occurred. It is true that there are authorities which hold that "a clause in a contract providing that all matters in dispute between the parties shall be referred to arbitrators and to them alone, is contrary to public policy and cannot oust the courts of jurisdiction" (Manila Electric Co. <i>vs.</i> Pasay Transportation Co., 57 Phil., 600, 603), <b>however, there are authorities which favor "the more intelligent view that arbitration, as an inexpensive, speedy and amicable method of settling disputes, and as a means of avoiding litigation, should receive every encouragement from the courts which may be extended without contravening sound public policy or settled law" (3 Am. Jur., p. 835). Congress has officially adopted the modern view when it reproduced in the new Civil Code the provisions of the old Code on Arbitration.&nbsp; And only recently&nbsp; it&nbsp; approved Republic&nbsp; Act&nbsp; No. 876 expressly authorizing arbitration of future disputes.</b><font color="#FF0000"><sup>[72]</sup></font> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>In view of our policy to adopt arbitration as a manner of settling disputes, arbitration clauses are liberally construed to favor arbitration. Thus, in <i>LM Power Engineering Corporation v. Capitol Industrial Construction Groups, Inc.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> this court said:<br><br><blockquote>Being an inexpensive, speedy and amicable method of settling disputes, arbitration — along with mediation, conciliation and negotiation — is encouraged by the Supreme Court. Aside from unclogging judicial dockets, arbitration also hastens the resolution of disputes, especially of the commercial kind. It is thus regarded as the "wave of the future" in international civil and commercial disputes. Brushing aside a contractual agreement calling for arbitration between the parties would be a step backward.<br><br><b>Consistent with the above-mentioned policy of encouraging alternative dispute resolution methods, courts should liberally construe arbitration clauses. Provided such clause is susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute, an order to arbitrate should be granted. Any doubt should be resolved in favor of arbitration</b>.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[74]</sup></font> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>A more clear-cut statement of the state policy to encourage arbitration and to favor interpretations that would render effective an arbitration clause was later expressed in Republic Act No. 9285:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br><blockquote><b>SEC. 2. <i>Declaration of Policy</i></b>. - It is hereby declared the policy of the State to actively promote party autonomy in the resolution of disputes, or the freedom of the party to make their own arrangements to resolve their disputes. <b>Towards this end, the State shall encourage and actively promote the use of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) as an important means to achieve speedy and impartial justice and declog court dockets.</b> As such, the State shall provide means for the use of ADR as an efficient tool and an alternative procedure for the resolution of appropriate cases. Likewise, the State shall enlist active private sector participation in the settlement of disputes through ADR. This Act shall be without prejudice to the adoption by the Supreme Court of any ADR system, such as mediation, conciliation, arbitration, or any combination thereof as a means of achieving speedy and efficient means of resolving cases pending before all courts in the Philippines which shall be governed by such rules as the Supreme Court may approve from time to time.<br><br>. . . . <br><br><b>SEC. 25. <i>Interpretation of the Act.</i> </b>- In interpreting the Act,<b> the court shall have due regard to the policy of the law in favor of arbitration</b>. Where action is commenced by or against multiple parties, one or more of whom are parties who are bound by the arbitration agreement although the civil action may continue as to those who are not bound by such arbitration agreement. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Thus, if there is an interpretation that would render effective an arbitration clause for purposes of avoiding litigation and expediting resolution of the dispute, that interpretation shall be adopted.<br><br>Petitioners' main argument arises from the separate personality given to juridical persons <i>vis-a-vis</i> their directors, officers, stockholders, and agents. Since they did not sign the arbitration agreement in any capacity, they cannot be forced to submit to the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Tribunal in accordance with the arbitration agreement. Moreover, they had already resigned as directors of Shangri-La at the time of the alleged default.<br><br>Indeed, as petitioners point out, their personalities as directors of Shangri-La are separate and distinct from Shangri-La.<br><br>A corporation is an artificial entity created by fiction of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> This means that while it is not a person, naturally, the law gives it a distinct personality and treats it as such. A corporation, in the legal sense, is an individual with a personality that is distinct and separate from other persons including its stockholders, officers, directors, representatives,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> and other juridical entities.<br><br>The law vests in corporations rights, powers, and attributes as if they were natural persons with physical existence and capabilities to act on their own.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> For instance, they have the power to sue and enter into transactions or contracts. Section 36 of the Corporation Code enumerates some of a corporation's powers, thus:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 36</b>. <i>Corporate powers and capacity</i>. - Every corporation incorporated under this Code has the power and capacity:<br><br>1. To sue and be sued in its corporate name;<br><br>2. Of succession by its corporate name for the period of time stated in the articles of incorporation and the certificate of incorporation;<br><br>3. To adopt and use a corporate seal;<br><br>4. To amend its articles of incorporation in accordance with the provisions of this Code;<br><br>5. To adopt by-laws, not contrary to law, morals, or public policy, and to amend or repeal the same in accordance with this Code;<br><br>6. In case&nbsp; of stock corporations,&nbsp; to&nbsp; issue&nbsp; or sell&nbsp; stocks to subscribers and to sell treasury stocks in accordance with the provisions of this Code; and to admit members to the corporation if it be a non-stock corporation;<br><br>7. To purchase, receive, take or grant, hold, convey, sell, lease, pledge, mortgage and otherwise deal with such real and personal property, including securities and bonds of other corporations, as the transaction of the lawful business of the corporation may reasonably&nbsp; and&nbsp; necessarily&nbsp; require, subject&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; limitations prescribed by law and the Constitution;<br><br>8. To enter into merger or consolidation with other corporations as provided in this Code;<br><br>9. To make reasonable donations, including those for the public welfare or for hospital, charitable, cultural, scientific, civic, or similar purposes:&nbsp; Provided,&nbsp; That&nbsp; no&nbsp; corporation,&nbsp; domestic&nbsp; or foreign, shall give donations in aid of any political party or candidate or for purposes of partisan political activity;<br><br>10. To establish pension, retirement, and other plans for the benefit of its directors, trustees, officers and employees; and<br><br>11. To exercise such other powers as may be essential or necessary to carry out its purpose or purposes as stated in its articles of incorporation. (13a)</blockquote><br>Because a corporation's existence is only by fiction of law, it can only exercise its rights and powers through its directors, officers, or agents, who are all natural persons. A corporation cannot sue or enter into contracts without them.<br><br>A consequence of a corporation's separate personality is that consent by a corporation through its representatives is not consent of the representative, personally. Its obligations, incurred through official acts of its representatives, are its own. A stockholder, director, or representative does not become a party to a contract just because a corporation executed a )C contract through that stockholder, director or representative.<br><br>Hence, a corporation's representatives are generally not bound by the terms of the contract executed by the corporation. They are not personally liable for obligations and liabilities incurred on or in behalf of the corporation.<br><br>Petitioners&nbsp; are&nbsp; also&nbsp; correct that arbitration promotes the parties' autonomy in resolving their disputes. This court recognized in <i>Heirs of Augusto Salas, Jr. v. Laperal Realty Corporation</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> that an arbitration clause shall not apply to persons who were neither parties to the contract nor assignees of previous parties, thus:<br><br><blockquote>A submission to arbitration is a contract. As such, the Agreement, containing the stipulation on arbitration, binds the parties thereto, as well as their assigns and heirs. But only they.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br>Similarly, in <i>Del Monte Corporation-USA v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> this court ruled:<br><br><blockquote>The provision to submit to arbitration any dispute arising therefrom and the relationship of the parties is part of that contract and is itself a contract. As a rule, contracts are respected as the law between the contracting parties and produce effect as between them, their assigns and heirs. Clearly, only parties to the Agreement . . . are bound by the Agreement and its arbitration clause as they are the only signatories thereto.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> (Citation omitted)</blockquote><br>This court incorporated these rulings in <i>Agan, Jr. v. Philippine International Air Terminals Co., Inc</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> and <i>Stanfilco Employees v.

He or she is generally not considered a party to that agreement.<br><br>However, there are instances when the distinction between personalities of directors, officers, and representatives, and of the corporation, are disregarded. We call this piercing the veil of corporate fiction.<br><br>Piercing the corporate veil is warranted when "[the separate personality of a corporation] is used as a means to perpetrate fraud or an illegal act, or as a vehicle for the evasion of an existing obligation, the circumvention of statutes, or to confuse legitimate issues."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> It is also warranted in alter ego cases "where a corporation is merely a farce since it is a mere alter ego or business conduit of a person, or where the corporation is so organized and controlled and its affairs are so conducted as to make it merely an instrumentality, agency, conduit or adjunct of another corporation."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>When corporate veil is pierced, the corporation and persons who are normally treated as distinct from the corporation are treated as one person, such that when the corporation is adjudged liable, these persons, too, become liable as if they were the corporation.<br><br>Among the persons who may be treated as the corporation itself under certain circumstances are its directors and officers. Section 31 of the Corporation Code provides the instances when directors, trustees, or officers may become liable for corporate acts:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 31. Liability of directors, trustees or officers. - Directors or trustees who willfully and knowingly vote for or assent to patently unlawful acts of the corporation or who are guilty of gross negligence or bad faith in directing the affairs of the corporation or acquire any personal or pecuniary interest in conflict with their duty as such directors or trustees shall be liable jointly and severally for all damages resulting therefrom suffered by the corporation, its stockholders or members and other persons.<br><br>When a director, trustee or officer attempts to acquire or acquires, in violation of his duty, any interest adverse to the corporation in respect of any matter which has been reposed in him in confidence, as to which equity imposes a disability upon him to deal in his own behalf, he shall be liable as a trustee for the corporation and must account for the profits which otherwise would have accrued to the corporation, (n)</blockquote><br>Based on the above provision, a director, trustee, or officer of a corporation may be made solidarily liable with it for all damages suffered by the corporation, its stockholders or members, and other persons in any of the following cases:<br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="CENTER">a)</div></td> <td width="90%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">The director or trustee willfully and knowingly voted for or assented to a patently unlawful corporate act; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">b)</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">The director or trustee was guilty of gross negligence or bad faith in directing corporate affairs; and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">c) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">The director or trustee acquired personal or pecuniary interest in conflict with his or her duties as director or trustee.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><br>Solidary liability with the corporation will also attach in the following instances:<br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="CENTER">a)</div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">"When a director or officer has consented to the issuance of watered stocks or who, having knowledge thereof, did not forthwith file with the corporate secretary his written objection thereto";<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">b) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">"When a director, trustee or officer has contractually agreed or stipulated to hold himself personally and solidarity liable with the corporation";<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[88]</sup></font> and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">c) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">"When a director, trustee or officer is made, by specific provision of law, personally liable for his corporate action."<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[89]</sup></font></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><br>When there are allegations of bad faith or malice against corporate directors or representatives, it becomes the duty of courts or tribunals to determine if these persons and the corporation should be treated as one. Without a trial, courts and tribunals have no basis for determining whether the veil of corporate fiction should be pierced. Courts or tribunals do not have such prior knowledge. Thus, the courts or tribunals must first determine whether circumstances exist to warrant the courts or tribunals to disregard the distinction between the corporation and the persons representing it. The determination of these circumstances must be made by one tribunal or court in a proceeding participated in by all parties involved, including current representatives of the corporation, and those persons whose personalities are impliedly the same as the corporation. This is because when the court or tribunal finds that circumstances exist warranting the piercing of the corporate veil, the corporate representatives are treated as the corporation itself and should be held liable for corporate acts. The corporation's distinct personality is disregarded, and the corporation is seen as a mere aggregation of persons undertaking a business under the collective name of the corporation.<br><br>Hence, when the directors, as in this case, are impleaded in a case against a corporation, alleging malice or bad faith on their part in directing the affairs of the corporation, complainants are effectively alleging that the directors and the corporation are not acting as separate entities. They are alleging that the acts or omissions by the corporation that violated their rights are also the directors' acts or omissions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> They are alleging that contracts executed by the corporation are contracts executed by the directors. Complainants effectively pray that the corporate veil be pierced because the cause of action between the corporation and the directors is the same.<br><br>In that case, complainants have no choice but to institute only one proceeding against the parties. Under the Rules of Court, filing of multiple suits for a single cause of action is prohibited. Institution of more than one suit for the same cause of action constitutes splitting the cause of action, which is a ground for the dismissal of the others. Thus, in Rule 2:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 3.</b> <i>One suit for a single cause of action</i>. — A party may not institute more than one suit for a single cause of action. (3a)<br><br><b>Section 4</b>. <i>Splitting a single cause of action; effect of.</i> — If two or more suits are instituted on the basis of the same cause of action, the filing of one or a judgment upon the merits in any one is available as a ground for the dismissal of the others. (4a)</blockquote><br>It is because the personalities of petitioners and the corporation may later be found to be indistinct that we rule that petitioners may be compelled to submit to arbitration.<br><br>However, in ruling that petitioners may be compelled to submit to the arbitration proceedings, we are not overturning <i>Heirs of Angus to Salas</i> wherein this court affirmed the basic arbitration principle that only parties to an arbitration agreement may be compelled to submit to arbitration.<br><br>In that case, this court recognized that persons other than the main party may be compelled to submit to arbitration, e.g., assignees and heirs. Assignees and heirs may be considered parties to an arbitration agreement entered into by their assignor because the assignor's rights and obligations are transferred to them upon assignment. In other words, the assignor's rights and obligations become their own rights and obligations. In the same way, the corporation's obligations are treated as the representative's obligations when the corporate veil is pierced.<br><br>Moreover, in <i>Heirs of Angus to Salas,</i> this court affirmed its policy against multiplicity of suits and unnecessary delay.&nbsp; This court said that "to split the proceeding into arbitration for some parties and trial for other parties would "result in multiplicity of suits, duplicitous procedure and unnecessary delay."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> This court also intimated that the interest of justice would be best observed if it adjudicated rights in a single proceeding.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> While the facts of that case prompted this court to direct the trial court to proceed to determine the issues of that case, it did not prohibit' courts from allowing the case to proceed to arbitration, when circumstances warrant.<br><br>Hence, the issue of whether the corporation's acts in violation of complainant's rights, and the incidental issue of whether piercing of the corporate veil is warranted, should be determined in a single proceeding. Such finding would determine if the corporation is merely an aggregation of persons whose liabilities must be treated as one with the corporation.<br><br>However, when the courts disregard the corporation's distinct and separate personality from its directors or officers, the courts do not say that the corporation, in all instances and for all purposes, is the same as its directors, stockholders, officers, and agents. It does not result in an absolute confusion of personalities of the corporation and the persons composing or representing it. Courts merely discount the distinction and treat them as one, in relation to a specific act, in order to extend the terms of the contract and the liabilities for all damages to erring corporate officials who participated in the corporation's illegal acts. This is done so that the legal fiction cannot be used to perpetrate illegalities and injustices.<br><br>Thus, in cases alleging solidary liability with the corporation or praying for the piercing of the corporate veil, parties who are normally treated as distinct individuals should be made to participate in the arbitration proceedings in order to determine if such distinction should indeed be disregarded and, if so, to determine the extent of their liabilities.<br><br>In this case, the Arbitral Tribunal rendered a decision, finding that BF Corporation failed to prove the existence of circumstances that render petitioners and the other directors solidarity liable. It ruled that petitioners and Shangri-La's other directors were not liable for the contractual obligations of Shangri-La to BF Corporation. The Arbitral Tribunal's decision was made with the participation of petitioners, albeit with their continuing objection. In view of our discussion above, we rule that petitioners are bound by such decision. <br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.
