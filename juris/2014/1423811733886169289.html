				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">For resolution is a complaint for disbarment filed by Spouses Nicasio and Donelita San Pedro (complainants) against Atty. Isagani A. Mendoza (respondent).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; This case involves a determination of whether respondent violated his duty to hold in trust all moneys and properties of the client; his duty to account for all funds and property collected or received for or from the client; and his duty to deliver the funds and property of the client when due or upon demand under the Code of Professional Responsibility.<br><br>The facts are summarized as follows:<br><br>On or about November 21, 1996, complainants engaged the services of respondent to facilitate the transfer of title to property, in the name of Isabel Azcarraga Marcaida, to complainants.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Complainants then gave respondent a check for P68,250.00 for the payment of transfer taxes.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>&nbsp; They also gave respondent a check for ?13,800.00 for respondent’s professional fee.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Respondent failed to produce the title despite complainants’ repeated follow-ups.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Several letters were sent by respondent explaining the delay in the transfer of title.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>&nbsp; However, respondent still failed to produce the title.<br><br>Complainants subsequently referred the case to the barangay.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Respondent refused to return the amount complainants gave for the transfer taxes.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; Complainants were then issued a certificate to file action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>&nbsp; They also sent a letter demanding the refund of the money intended for the transfer taxes.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp; Respondent still did not return the money.<br><br>On May 8, 2000, respondent sent another letter to complainants.&nbsp; He promised to settle the transfer of the land title.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; However, respondent reneged on this promise.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; Complainants were then forced to obtain a loan from Philippine American Life and General Insurance Company to secure the transfer of the title to the property in their names.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Respondent contested the allegations of complainants.&nbsp; According to him, it was complainants who caused the three-year delay in the transfer of title to complainants’ names.&nbsp; Complainants were not able to furnish respondent several important documents: (a) original copy of the deed of extrajudicial petition; (b) affidavit of publication with the clippings of the published item in a newspaper of general circulation; and (c) a barangay certificate from the barangay where the property is located as required by the Bureau of Internal Revenue.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>In addition, respondent argued that complainants paid him the measly sum of P13,800.00 despite all the work he did for them, including facilitating the sale of the property.&nbsp; These involved “being-pulled from the office four or five times to discuss . . . the details of the transaction [with the sellers]; going twice to the Regional Trial Court of Biñan, Laguna[,] Branch 24, to expedite the . . . issuance of a [n]ew owner’s duplicate copy of the title; going twice to the office of the Register of Deeds for Calamba, Laguna to make verification and submit the court [o]rder; [and facilitating the] preparation and notarization of the Deed of Absolute Sale.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Respondent also claimed that retention of the money is justified owing to his receivables from complainants for the services he rendered in various cases:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">1) </div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="JUSTIFY">In the case of Spouses Nicasio and Donelita San Pedro versus Severo Basbas, for Forcible Entry, docketed as Civil Case No. 2004 in the Metropolitan Trial Court of Santa Rosa, Laguna.

Thus, Resolution No. XVIII-2008-399 dated August 14, 2008 is hereby<b> AFFIRMED</b></i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> (Emphasis and italics in the original)</blockquote><br>On December 11, 2013, this court resolved to note the following: (a) Notice of Resolution No. XVIII-2008-399 dated August 14, 2008 of the IBP Board of Governors; (b) Notice of Resolution No. XX-2013-839 dated June 22, 2013 of the IBP Board of Governors; and (c) IBP’s letter dated October 7, 2013 transmitting the documents pertaining to the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>In the manifestation and motion dated October 25, 2013, respondent requested for a formal hearing, reasoning that he “wants to exercise his right to confront his accusers [to] cross[-]examine them and that of their witness.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; The manifestation and motion was denied by this court in the resolution dated September 22, 2014.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>The main issue in this case is whether respondent is guilty of violating Canon 16 of the Code of Professional Responsibility for failing to hold in trust the money of his clients.<br><br>After considering the parties’ arguments and the records of this case, this court resolves to adopt and approve the Notice of Resolution No. XX-2013-839 dated June 22, 2013 of the IBP Board of Governors.<br><br>It has been said that “[t]he practice of law is a privilege bestowed on lawyers who meet the high standards of legal proficiency and morality.&nbsp; Any conduct that shows a violation of the norms and values of the legal profession exposes the lawyer to administrative liability.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>An examination of the records reveals that respondent violated the Code of Professional Responsibility.<br><br>Canon 16 of the Code of Professional Responsibility states:<br><br><blockquote>CANON 16 - A LAWYER SHALL HOLD IN TRUST ALL MONEYS AND PROPERTIES OF HIS CLIENT THAT MAY COME INTO HIS POSSESSION.<br><br><i>Rule 16.01 – A lawyer shall account for all money or property collected or received for or from the client.</i><br><br>Rule 16.02 – A lawyer shall keep the funds of each client separate and apart from his own and those of others kept by him.<br><br><i>Rule 16.03 – A lawyer shall deliver the funds and property of his client when due or upon demand. However, he shall have a lien over the funds and may apply so much thereof as may be necessary to satisfy his lawful fees and disbursements, giving notice promptly thereafter to his client. He shall also have a lien to the same extent on all judgments and executions he has secured for his client as provided for in the Rules of Court.</i><br><br>Rule 16.04 – A lawyer shall not borrow money from his client unless the client’s interests are fully protected by the nature of the case or by independent advice. Neither shall a lawyer lend money to a client except, when in the interest of justice, he has to advance necessary expenses in a legal matter he is handling for the client.</blockquote><br>Similarly, Rule138, Section 25 of the Rules of Court provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 25.&nbsp; Unlawful retention of client's funds; contempt. — When an attorney unjustly retains in his hands money of his client after it has been demanded, he may be punished for contempt as an officer of the Court who has misbehaved in his official transactions; but proceedings under this section shall not be a bar to a criminal prosecution.</blockquote><br>A lawyer’s duty under Canon 16 of the Code of Professional Responsibility is clear:<br><br><blockquote>The fiduciary nature of the relationship between counsel and client imposes on a lawyer the duty to account for the money or property collected or received for or from the client[,] [thus] . . . [w]hen a lawyer collects or receives money from his client for a particular purpose (such as for filing fees, registration fees, transportation and office expenses), <i>he should promptly account to the client how the money was spent. If he does not use the money for its intended purpose, he must immediately return it to the client</i>. His failure either to render an accounting or to return the money (if the intended purpose of the money does not materialize) constitutes a blatant disregard of Rule 16.01 of the Code of Professional Responsibility.<br><br>[The lawyer’s] failure to return the client’s money upon demand gives rise to the presumption that he has misappropriated it for his own use to the prejudice of and in violation of the trust reposed in him by the client.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Respondent admitted that there were delays in the transfer of title of property to complainants’ name.&nbsp; He continuously assured complainants that he would still fulfill his duty.&nbsp; However, after three (3) years and several demands from complainants, respondent failed to accomplish the task given to him and even refused to return the money.&nbsp; Complainants’ alleged failure to provide the necessary documents to effect the transfer does not justify his violation of his duty under the Code of Professional Responsibility.<br><br>Respondent’s assertion of a valid lawyer’s lien is also untenable.&nbsp; A valid retaining lien has the following elements:<br><br><blockquote>An attorney’s retaining lien is fully recognized if the presence of the following elements concur: (1) lawyer-client relationship; (2) lawful possession of the client’s funds, documents and papers; and (3) unsatisfied claim for attorney’s fees. Further, the attorney’s retaining lien is a general lien for the balance of the account between the attorney and his client, and applies to the documents and funds of the client which may come into the attorney’s possession in the course of his employment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></blockquote><br>Respondent did not satisfy all the elements of a valid retaining lien.&nbsp; He did not present evidence as to an unsatisfied claim for attorney’s fees.&nbsp; The enumeration of cases he worked on for complainants remains unsubstantiated.&nbsp; When there is no unsatisfied claim for attorney’s fees, lawyers cannot validly retain their client’s funds or properties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, assuming that respondent had proven all the requisites for a valid retaining lien, he cannot appropriate for himself his client’s funds without the proper accounting and notice to the client.&nbsp; The rule is that when there is “a disagreement, or when the client disputes the amount claimed by the lawyer . . . the lawyer should not arbitrarily apply the funds in his possession to the payment of his fees. . . .”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>We also note that despite complainant Nicasio San Pedro’s affidavit of desistance dated March 14, 2008, both complainants signed their comment to respondent’s motion for reconsideration and prayed that the motion be dismissed for lack of merit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, respondent Atty. Isagani A. Mendoza is <b>SUSPENDED</b> from the practice of law for three (3) months.&nbsp; He is also ordered to <b>RETURN </b>to complainants the amount of ?68,250.00 with 6% legal interest from the date of finality of this judgment until full payment. Respondent is further <b>DIRECTED </b>to submit to this court proof of payment of the amount within 10 days from payment.&nbsp; Let a copy of this resolution be entered in respondent Atty. Isagani A.
