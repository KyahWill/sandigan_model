				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Well-settled is the rule that “conveyances by virtue of a forged signature. . . are void <i>ab initio</i> [as] [t]he absence of the essential [requisites] of consent and cause or consideration in these cases rendered the contract inexistent[.]”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>Before us is a petition for review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> filed by Amada Cotoner-Zacarias against respondent spouses Alfredo Revilla and Paz Castillo-Revilla, praying that this court render a decision “reversing the Decision of the Regional Trial Court and Court of Appeals and declaring the transfer of title to the Petitioner and then to her successors-in-interest as valid and binding as against the respondents.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals summarized the facts as follows.<br><br>Alfredo Revilla and Paz Castillo-Revilla (Revilla spouses) are the owners in fee simple of a 15,000-square-meter unregistered parcel of land in Silang, Cavite, covered by Tax Declaration No. 7971.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>In 1983, the Revilla spouses faced financial difficulties in raising funds for Alfredo Revilla’s travel to Saudi Arabia, so Paz Castillo-Revilla borrowed money from Amada Cotoner-Zacarias (Amada).&nbsp; By way of security, the parties verbally agreed that Amada would take physical possession of the property, cultivate it, then use the earnings from the cultivation to pay the loan and realty taxes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>&nbsp; Upon full payment of the loan, Amada would return the property to the Revilla spouses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Unknown to the Revilla spouses, Amada presented a fictitious document entitled “Kasulatan ng Bilihan ng Lupa” before the Provincial Assessor of Cavite.&nbsp; This document was executed on March 19, 1979 with the Revilla spouses as sellers and Amada as buyer of the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Consequently, Tax Declaration No. 7971 in the name of the Revilla spouses was cancelled, and Tax Declaration No. 19773 in the name of Amada was issued.<br><br>On August 25, 1984, Amada sold the property to the spouses Adolfo and Elvira Casorla (Casorla spouses) by “Deed of Absolute Sale-Unregistered Land.”&nbsp; Tax Declaration No. 30411-A was later issued in the name of the Casorla spouses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>In turn, the Casorla spouses executed a deed of absolute sale dated December 16, 1991 in favor of the spouses Rodolfo and Yolanda Sun (Sun spouses).&nbsp; Tax Declaration Nos. 30852-A and 18584 were issued in favor of the Sun spouses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>In December 1994, Alfredo Revilla returned from Saudi Arabia.&nbsp; He asked Amada why she had not returned their tax declaration considering their full payment of the loan.&nbsp; He then discovered that the property’s tax declaration was already in the name of the Sun spouses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On February 15, 1995, the Revilla spouses were served a copy of the answer<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> in the land registration case filed by the Sun spouses for the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; The Revilla spouses then saw a copy of the “Kasulatan ng Bilihan ng Lupa” and noticed that their signatures as sellers were forged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>They then demanded the cancellation of the “Kasulatan ng Bilihan ng Lupa” from Amada and all subsequent transfers of the property, its reconveyance, and the restoration of its tax declaration in their name.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; Amada failed to take action.<br><br>On November 17, 1995, the Revilla spouses filed a complaint before the Tagaytay Regional Trial Court for the annulment of sales and transfers of title and reconveyance of the property with damages against Amada, the Casorla spouses, the Sun spouses, and the Provincial Assessor of Cavite.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>In her answer, Amada denied that the property was used as a security for the Revilla spouses’ loan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; Instead, she claimed that the Revilla spouses voluntarily executed the “Kasulatan ng Bilihan ng Lupa” in her favor on March 19, 1979.&nbsp; She added that the Revilla spouses’ cause of action already prescribed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>For their part, the Sun spouses argued good faith belief that Amada was the real owner of the property as Amada showed them a tax declaration in her name and the “Kasulatan ng Bilihan ng Lupa” allegedly executed by the Revilla spouses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; When the Sun spouses discovered there was another sale with the Casorla spouses, they were assured by Amada that she had already bought back the property from the Casorla spouses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; Subsequently, the Casorla spouses executed a deed of absolute sale dated December 16, 1991 in favor of the Sun spouses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; They also argued prescription against the Revilla spouses, and prayed for damages against Amada by way of cross-claim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>On August 3, 2006, the Regional Trial Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> found the “Kasulatan ng Bilihan ng Lupa” to be a fictitious document, and ruled in favor of the Revilla spouses:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:<br><br><ol><li>Declaring the sales/transfers from Tax Declaration No. 7971, s. 1980 to Tax Declaration No. 18584, s. 1994 as NULL and VOID, without valid transmission of title and interest from the original owners, plaintiffs herein and consequently, entitling plaintiffs to reinstatement and reconveyance of their title/tax declaration as well as possession of the subject property;<br><br></li><li>Ordering defendant Zacarias to pay the following:<br><blockquote>2.1 To the Plaintiffs:<br><ol type="a"><li>P50,000.00 for moral damages;<br></li><li>P20,000.00 for exemplary damages;

The dispositive portion reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing premises, judgment is hereby rendered by us <b>DISMISSING</b> the appeal filed by defendant-appellant Amada C. Zacarias in this case, and <b>PARTIALLY GRANTING </b>the appeal filed by the Spouses Rodolfo and Yolanda Sun. The Decision dated August 3, 2006 rendered by Branch 18 of the Regional Trial Court of the Fourth Judicial Region stationed in Tagaytay City, Cavite in Civil Case No. TG-1543 is <b>MODIFIED</b> in that defendant-appellant Amada C. Zacarias is ordered to pay interest at 6% per annum on the principal obligation in the amount of P467,350.00 from February 3, 1995, the date of the first judicial demand by the Spouses Sun, until said decision on the principal obligation became final and executory, and interest at 12% per annum on the principal obligation, moral and exemplary damages, as well as attorney’s fees, from the time said decision became final and executory until full payment of said amounts.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></blockquote><br>The Court of Appeals denied Amada’s motion for reconsideration; hence, she filed this petition.<br><br>Petitioner argues that the antichresis claim of the Revilla spouses was not reduced into writing, thus, it is void under Article 2134 of the Civil Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; She submits that the allegation of antichresis was only an excuse by the Revilla spouses for their failure to impugn possession of the property by Amada and her successors-in-interest for over 16 years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Petitioner contends that the sale in her favor was established by the “Kasulatan ng Bilihan ng Lupa,” the delivery of the tax declaration, and the testimony of one Mrs. Rosita Castillo (Rosita).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; Rosita was the second wife of Felimon Castillo, the previous owner of the property.&nbsp; She testified that respondent Paz Castillo-Revilla admitted to her father, Felimon, that she and Alfredo Revilla sold the property to Amada. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>On the alleged forgery, petitioner submits that the court misapplied the principle that “he who alleges not he who denies must prove” when it stated that she had the burden of proving the due execution of the deed of absolute sale.&nbsp; Since the Revilla spouses alleged that the deed was a forged document, they had the burden of proving the forgery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; She then cites the trial court in that “[a]ccordingly, the National Bureau of Investigation was not able to ascertain the genuineness of the signature of plaintiff Paz Revilla because of lack of sufficient sample signatures. . . .”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>On the prescription argument, the parties live in a very small barangay.&nbsp; While Alfredo Revilla worked in Saudi Arabia, he admitted returning to the Philippines twice a year, while his wife never left Silang, Cavite,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> and yet the Revilla spouses never questioned the activities on the property for more than 16 years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>On the proper docket fees, petitioner contends that the Revilla spouses paid docket fees based on their prayer for actual damages of P50,000.00, moral damages of P50,000.00, and attorney’s fee of P80,000.00, when they should have based it on P12,000,000.00, the value of the property they alleged in their supplemental pre-trial brief.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Lastly, petitioner argues that the property is conjugal in nature, but the court never declared that respondent Paz Castillo-Revilla’s signature was falsified.&nbsp; Thus, the sale over her half of the property cannot be declared void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; She adds that the Sun spouses are buyers in good faith for value, making reinstatement of the property impossible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Respondents Revilla spouses counter that the factual issue of whether the “Kasulatan ng Bilihan ng Lupa” is a falsified document was already conclusively resolved by the lower courts and, generally, factual findings are beyond this court’s power of review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>On the prescription issue, respondents Revilla spouses argue that an action or defense to declare a document null is imprescriptible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp; Laches also does not apply since they immediately questioned the fraudulent transfers by filing a complaint in November 1995 upon learning of the questionable documents in February 1995, after Alfredo had returned from Saudi Arabia in December 1994.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Respondents Revilla spouses contend that they paid the proper docket fees.&nbsp; The P12,000,000.00 mentioned during pre-trial that petitioner insists should have been the basis of the fees was neither stated in the complaint nor awarded by the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Respondents Revilla spouses argue that the court did not err in ordering reinstatement of the property to them.&nbsp; First, the defense that the Sun spouses were buyers in good faith is a personal defense that cannot be raised by petitioner who was not privy to the sale between the Casorla spouses and the Sun spouses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>&nbsp; Second, an alternative prayer for damages cannot be interpreted as an admission that the relief for reinstatement is not viable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>&nbsp; Third, the transaction happened prior to the effectivity of the Family Code; thus, Article 172 of the Civil Code applies such that “[t]he wife cannot bind the conjugal partnership without the husband’s consent, except in cases provided by law.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>&nbsp; Consequently, the result is the same even if respondent Paz Castillo-Revilla did not testify that the signature is not hers, as she cannot bind the entire property without her husband’s consent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>&nbsp; Lastly, no unjust enrichment exists since they were deprived of their property for so long.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>The issues for this court’s resolution are as follows:<br><br>First, whether respondents Revilla spouses’ cause of action is barred by prescription or laches;<br><br>Second, whether the trial court acquired jurisdiction when respondents Revilla spouses paid filing fees based on the P50,000.00 claim for damages in the complaint but stated in their supplemental pre-trial brief that the property is valued at P12,000,000.00; and<br><br>Third, whether the Court of Appeals erred in upholding the reinstatement and reconveyance of the property in favor of respondents Revilla spouses.<br><br><center>I.<br></center><br>On the first issue, petitioner argues that respondents Revilla spouses’ claim is barred by laches since they allowed 16 years to lapse, with petitioner having possession of the property, before filing suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Laches has been defined as “the failure or neglect, for an unreasonable and unexplained length of time, to do that which — by the exercise of due diligence — could or should have been done earlier.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>The elements that need to be present and proven before an action is considered barred by laches are the following:<br><br><blockquote>The four basic elements of laches are: (1) conduct on the part of the defendant, or of one under whom he claims, giving rise to the situation of which complaint is made and for which the complaint seeks a remedy; (2) delay in asserting the complainant's rights, the complainant having had knowledge or notice of the defendant’s conduct and having been afforded an opportunity to institute suit; (3) lack of knowledge or notice on the part of the defendant that the complainant would assert the right on which he bases his suit; and, (4) injury or prejudice to the defendant in the event relief is accorded to the complainant or the suit is not held to be barred.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></blockquote><br>There was no delay by respondents Revilla spouses in asserting their rights over the property.&nbsp; The lower courts found that respondents Revilla spouses first learned of the existence of the “Kasulatan ng Bilihan ng Lupa” in February 1995 when they were served a copy of the pleading in the land registration case instituted by the Sun spouses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>&nbsp; They filed their complaint within the same year, specifically, on November 17, 1995.&nbsp; The lapse of only nine (9) months from the time they learned of the questionable transfers on the property cannot be considered as sleeping on their rights.<br><br>In any case, doctrines of equity such as laches apply only in the absence of statutory law.&nbsp; The Civil Code clearly provides that “[t]he action or defense for the declaration of the inexistence of a contract does not prescribe.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>&nbsp; This court has discussed:<br><br><blockquote><i>Laches</i> is a doctrine in equity and our courts are basically courts of law and not courts of equity.&nbsp; Equity, which has been aptly described as "justice outside legality," should be applied only in the absence of, and never against, statutory law.&nbsp; <i>Aequetas nunguam contravenit legis</i>.&nbsp; The positive mandate of Art. 1410 of the New Civil Code conferring imprescriptibility to actions for declaration of the inexistence of a contract should pre-empt and prevail over all abstract arguments based only on equity.&nbsp; Certainly, <i>laches</i> cannot be set up to resist the enforcement of an imprescriptible legal right, and petitioners can validly vindicate their inheritance despite the lapse of time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br></blockquote><br><center>II.<br></center><br>On the second issue, petitioner argues that respondents Revilla spouses did not pay the correct docket fees.&nbsp; She submits that docket fees paid were based on the prayer for actual damages of P50,000.00, moral damages of P50,000.00, and attorney’s fee of P80,000.00, when the spouses Revilla should have based it on P12,000,000.00, the value of the property they alleged in their supplemental pre-trial brief.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>&nbsp; Petitioner cites Supreme Court Circular No. 7 and jurisprudence holding that the payment of proper docket fees is crucial in vesting courts with jurisdiction over the subject matter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>This court finds that respondents Revilla spouses paid the proper docket fees, thus, the trial court acquired jurisdiction.<br><br>It is true that “[i]t is not simply the filing of the complaint or appropriate initiatory pleading, but the payment of the prescribed docket fee, that vests a trial court with jurisdiction over the subject matter or nature of the action.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>In <i>Manchester Development Corporation v. Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> this court “condemned the practice of counsel who in filing the original complaint omitted from the prayer any specification of the amount of damages although the amount of over ?78 million is alleged in the body of the complaint.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>&nbsp; The court gave the following warning against this unethical practice that serves no other purpose than to avoid paying the correct filing fees:<br><br>The Court serves warning that it will take drastic action upon a repetition of this unethical practice.<br><br><blockquote>To put a stop to this irregularity, henceforth <i>all complaints, petitions, answers and other similar pleadings should specify the amount of damages being prayed for not only in the body of the pleading but also in the prayer, and said damages shall be considered in the assessment of the filing fees in any case</i>.&nbsp; Any pleading that fails to comply with this requirement shall not be accepted nor admitted, or shall otherwise be expunged from the record.<br><br>The Court acquires jurisdiction over any case only upon the payment of the prescribed docket fee.&nbsp; An amendment of the complaint or similar pleading will not thereby vest jurisdiction in the Court, much less the payment of the docket fee based on the amounts sought in the amended pleading.&nbsp; The ruling in the Magaspi case in so far as it is inconsistent with this pronouncement is overturned and reversed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>This ruling was circularized through Supreme Court Circular No. 7<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> addressed to all lower court judges and the Integrated Bar of the Philippines for dissemination to and guidance for all its members.<br><br>The facts of this case differ from <i>Manchester</i> and similar situations envisioned under the circular.&nbsp; The complaint filed by respondents Revilla spouses included in its prayer the amount of P50,000.00 as actual damages, without mention of any other amount in the body of the complaint.&nbsp; No amended complaint was filed to increase this amount in the prayer. Thus, the Court of Appeals found as follows:<br><br><blockquote>In the case at bench, the complaint filed by the Spouses Revilla only asked for actual damages in the amount of P50,000.00. While the Spouses Revilla mentioned the amount of P12,000,000.00 as actual damages in the pre-trial, said amount was not stated in the complaint and neither was it awarded by the lower court in its judgment. Hence, said amount was not even considered by the court a quo when it awarded damages in favor of the Spouses Revilla. Considering that the complaint was not formally amended by the spouses to increase the amount of actual damages being sought, <b><i>the trial court was not stripped of its jurisdiction to try the case since the Spouses Revilla correctly paid the docket fees based merely on what was prayed for in the complaint.</i></b> Indeed, the mere mentioning by the Spouses Revilla of the amount of P12,000,000.00 during the pre-trial is inconsequential, as the trial court properly acquired jurisdiction over the action when the Spouses Revilla filed the complaint and paid the requisite filing fees based on the amount as prayed for in the complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>In <i>Padlan v. Dinglasan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> this court reiterated that “[w]hat determines the jurisdiction of the court is the nature of the action pleaded as appearing from the allegations in the complaint [and] [t]he averments therein and the character of the relief sought are the ones to be consulted.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>Petitioner attached copies of the tax declarations and deeds of sale over the property to the petition.&nbsp; Tax Declaration No. 7971 in the name of respondents Revilla spouses provides that the land had a market value of P13,500.00, while the mango trees had a market value of P3,500.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup>&nbsp; Petitioner alleged in her petition that respondents Revilla spouses offered to sell the property to her for P50,000.00,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> while the trial court found that the “Kasulatan ng Bilihan ng Lupa” reflected the amount of P20,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup>&nbsp; Subsequent tax declarations in the name of petitioner, the Casorla spouses, and the Sun spouses all provided for land market values lower than P50,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup>&nbsp; The deed of sale in favor of the Casorla spouses states that the assessed value of the property was P1,400.00, and the consideration for the sale was P50,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup>&nbsp; The subsequent deed of sale in favor of the Sun spouses provides for the same amount as consideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>None of these documents submitted by petitioner indicate an amount in excess of the P50,000.00 prayed for by respondents Revilla spouses as actual damages in their complaint.&nbsp; Thus, the basis for the P12,000,000.00 value raised during pre-trial is unclear.&nbsp; Based on the complaint, respondents Revilla spouses paid the correct docket fees computed from the amounts in their prayer.<br><br><center>III.<br></center><br>The third issue involves the reinstatement of respondents Revilla spouses in the property and reconveyance of its tax declaration in their favor.<br><br>Petitioner argues that antichresis is a formal contract that must be in writing in order to be valid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup>&nbsp; Respondents Revilla spouses were not able to prove the existence of the alleged antichresis contract.&nbsp; On the other hand, the sale of the property to petitioner was established by the “Kasulatan ng Bilihan ng Lupa” and the testimony of Rosita Castillo, the second wife of the previous owner, Felimon Castillo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>We affirm the lower courts’ order of reinstatement and reconveyance of the property in favor of respondents Revilla spouses.<br><br>Respondents Revilla spouses’ complaint sought “to annul the sales and transfers of title emanating from Tax Declaration No. 7971 registered in their name involving a 15,000-square[-]meter unregistered land . . . with prayer for reconveyance and claims for damages.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup>&nbsp; There was no prayer to declare the purported contract of sale as antichresis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, respondents Revilla spouses neither discussed nor used the term “antichresis” in their comment and memorandum before this court.&nbsp; They focused on the nature of their complaint as one for annulment of titles on the ground of forgery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup>&nbsp; At most, the trial court’s summary of respondents Revilla spouses’ evidence described the parties’ agreements as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Plaintiffs’ evidence and the testimony of plaintiff Alfredo Revilla tend to indicate that plaintiffs are the owners in fee simple of a 15,000-square[-]meter unregistered land, located at Brgy. Adlas, Silang, Cavite.&nbsp; Their ownership being evidenced by Tax Declaration No. 7971, s. 1980 (Exh. “A”). Sometime in 1981, plaintiffs needed money for the travel and deployment of plaintiff Alfredo to Saudi Arabia.&nbsp; Plaintiff Paz Revilla sought financial help from defendant Cotoner-Zacarias from whom she was able to <i>obtain a loan but secured with and by way of mortgage of the subject property</i>.&nbsp; The parties further agreed that defendant <i>Cotoner-Zacarias would take possession of the subject property and cultivate it with the earnings therefrom to be used to pay-off the loan and the annual realty taxes on the land. </i> It was their agreement with defendant Cotoner-Zacarias that the latter <i>will rent the subject property</i> and with that agreement, the lease started sometime in 1981 and plantiffs got from defendant Cotoner-Zacarias the amount of Php3,000.00 as rental for the first year, 1981, with no specific agreement as to the period covered by such rental[.]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Article 2132 of the Civil Code provides that “[b]y the contract of antichresis the creditor acquires the right to receive the fruits of an immovable of his debtor, with the obligation to apply them to the payment of the interest, if owing, and thereafter to the principal of his credit.”<br><br>Thus, antichresis involves an express agreement between parties such that the creditor will have possession of the debtor’s real property given as security, and such creditor will apply the fruits of the property to the interest owed by the debtor, if any, then to the principal amount.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>The term, antichresis, has a Greek origin with “‘anti’ (against) and ‘chresis’ (use) denoting the action of giving a credit ‘against’ the ‘use’ of a property.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>Historically, 15<sup>th</sup> century B.C. tablets revealed that “antichresis contracts were commonly employed in the Sumerian and Akkadian Mesopotamian cultures.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup>&nbsp;
