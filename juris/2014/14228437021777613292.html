But during the pre-trial, BBB, wife of the accused-appellant and mother of AAA, the minor victim, disclaimed any further interest to pursue the case. Her reasons were that she pitied the accused-appellant and, according to her, AAA had already forgiven her father.

With DDD’s help, BBB confronted her daughter AAA, who told her that the accused-appellant did not only rape her that morning, but had sexually abused her several times since she was in Grade III.<br><br><center><b>Appeal to the CA</b><br></center><br>On appeal to the CA, the accused-appellant maintained that due to the absence of AAA’s testimony, the prosecution failed to establish the circumstances proving beyond reasonable doubt that he raped his daughter; that the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses PO3 Cobardo, BSF Estudillo and BSF Perlas, not being themselves victims or witnesses to the “startling occurrence” of rape, cannot create the hearsay exception of <i><i>res gestae</i></i> [literally, “things done”]; and, that the medical findings of Dr. Baluyot do not prove that he had carnal knowledge of AAA but only that she had had sexual relations.<br><br>In its appellee’s brief, the Office of Solicitor General (OSG) asserted that although AAA did not personally testify, and none of the prosecution witnesses had any direct knowledge of the sexual molestation of AAA by the accused-appellant, his guilt was fully established by <i>circumstantial evidence</i>. In particular, the OSG argued that the testimony of PO3 Cobardo concerning what AAA narrated to her during her investigation was part of the <i>res gestae</i> pursuant to Rule 130 of the Rules of Court. The OSG reasoned that AAA had just undergone a startling occurrence at the time she told PO3 Cobardo that she had been raped by her father that morning, a statement which PO3 Cobardo found spontaneous and credible; that the gap between the sexual assault and the time when AAA made her narration to PO3 Cobardo was too short to permit fabrication by AAA of such a serious accusation against her own father; and, that AAA made the charge in the presence of her mother could only have lent credence to her claim. Moreover, the claim of rape by AAA is corroborated by Dr. Baluyot’s finding that she has genital lacerations, in contrast to the accused-appellant’s only defense of a general and uncorroborated denial.<br><br>The appellate court agreed with the RTC and the OSG that the testimonies of the three prosecution witnesses, PO3 Cobardo, BSF Estudillo and BSF Perlas, form part of the <i>res gestae</i>, although none of them was a participant, victim or spectator to the crime. According to the CA, “they heard what [AAA] said when she reported the sexual abuse committed against her by accused-appellant Estibal.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> To further quote the CA:<br><blockquote>Thus, in this case, even if prosecution witnesses BSF Estudillo, BSF Perlas and PO3 Cobardo were not present during the startling occurrence experienced by AAA, they heard what she said when she reported the sexual abuse committed against her by accused-appellant Estibal. There is no merit to the argument of accused&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -appellant Estibal that, since prosecution witnesses BSF Estudillo, BSF Perlas and PO3 Cobardo were “neither participants or victims or spectators to the crime of rape being charged against the accused-appellant” their testimonies could not be considered as part of the <i>res gestae</i>.<br><br>The testimonies of said prosecution witnesses comply with the above-mentioned requisites, <i>viz</i>., there is no question that the sexual abuse committed by accused-appellant Estibal against her daughter AAA was a startling occurrence and a traumatic experience, at that; she had no opportunity to contrive or devise falsehood when she reported the crime to BSF Estudillo and BSF Perlas and narrated the incident to PO3 Cobardo hours after the incident; and, the statements she made was relative to her sexual abuse by accused-appellant Estibal and its attending circumstances.<br><br>There might be an intervening period between the time the crime of rape was committed and the first time it was reported by AAA to the prosecution witnesses. However, said intervening period of less than twenty-four (24) hours is so short a time for AAA to fully recover physically and emotionally from such a traumatic and harrowing experience, considering her tender age of only thirteen (13) years and the fact that her abuser is her own biological father.<br><br><i><i>Res gestae</i></i> refers to statements made by the participants or the victims of, or the spectators to, a crime immediately before, during, or after its commission. These statements are a spontaneous reaction or utterance inspired by the excitement of the occasion, without any opportunity for the declarant to fabricate a false statement. An important consideration is whether there intervened, between the occurrence and the statement, any circumstance calculated to divert the mind and thus restore the mental balance of the declarant; and afford an opportunity for deliberation.<br><br>Indeed, the statements made by AAA before BSF Estudillo, BSF Perlas and PO3 Cobardo were spontaneous and her utterances were inspired by the excitement of the occasion, without any opportunity to fabricate a false statement.<br><br>There is, of course, no hard and fast rule by which spontaneity may be determined although a number of factors have been considered, including, but not always confined to: (1) the time that has lapsed between the occurrence of the act or transaction and the making of the statement, (2) the place where the statement is made, (3) the condition of the declarant when the utterance is given, (4) the presence or absence of intervening events between the occurrence and the statement relative thereto, and (5) the nature and the circumstances of the statement itself. The Supreme Court, in <i>People v. Manhuyod</i>, has explained the import of the first four factors; thus:<br><blockquote>“x x x (C)ases are not uniform as to the interval of time that should separate the occurrence of the startling event and the making of the declaration. What is important is that the declarations were voluntarily and spontaneously made ‘so nearly contemporaneous as to be in the presence of the transaction which they illustrate or explain, and were made under such circumstances as necessarily to exclude the ideas of design or deliberation.’<br><br>“As to the second factor, it may be stressed that ‘a statement made, or an act done, at a place some distance from the place where the principal transaction occurred will not ordinarily possess such spontaneity as would render it admissible.’<br><br>“Anent the third factor, ‘[a] statement will ordinarily be deemed spontaneous if, at the time when it was made, the conditions of the declarant was such as to raise an inference that the effect of the occurrence on his mind still continued, as where he had just received a serious injury, was suffering severe pain, or was under intense excitement. Conversely, a lack of spontaneity may be inferred from the cool demeanor of declarant, his consciousness of the absence of all danger, his delay in making a statement until witnesses can be procured, or from the fact that he made a different statement prior to the one which is offered in evidence.’<br><br>“With regard to the fourth factor, what is to be considered is whether there intervened between the event or transaction and the making of the statement relative thereto, any circumstance calculated to divert the mind of the declarant which would thus restore his mental balance and afford opportunity for deliberation.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote></blockquote><center><b>Automatic review by the Supreme Court</b><br></center><br>Without the <i>res gestae</i> exception, the evidence of the prosecution would consist mainly of hearsay statements by PO3 Cobardo, BSF Estudillo and BSF Perlas all reiterating what AAA allegedly told them. The same question, whether <i>res gestae</i> as an exception to the hearsay rule must be appreciated from the factual circumstances of the case, is now before this Court in this automatic review.<br><br><b>To pardon her father, AAA chose to ignore the trial court’s subpoenas to testify in her rape complaint, thus leaving missing a vital component in the prosecution’s case, her eyewitness account. But in itself, her pardon would not have worked the dismissal of the rape case since it was given after the complaint was filed in court.</b><br><br>AAA never appeared at the trial proper despite several subpoenas for her to testify, and subsequent subpoenas could not be served after her family moved to a new but unknown address on April 13, 2010. Recall that at the pre-trial, BBB told the court that she was no longer interested in pursuing the case against the accused-appellant since her daughter had already pardoned him. It has, however, been held that even if it is construed as a pardon, AAA’s desistance is not by itself a ground to dismiss the complaint for rape against the accused-appellant once the complaint has been instituted in court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>In <i>People v. Bonaagua</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> the accused tried to invoke the affidavit of desistance executed by the minor victim’s mother stating that they would no longer pursue the rape cases against him. But the high court pointed out that since R.A. No. 8353, or the Anti-Rape Law, took effect in 1997, rape is no longer considered a crime against chastity. Having been reclassified as a crime against persons, it is no longer considered a private crime, or one which cannot be prosecuted except upon a complaint filed by the aggrieved party.

Although it was acknowledged that there is no hard and fast rule to establish it, the Court cited a number of factors to consider, already mentioned in <i>Dianos</i>. The review of the facts below constrains this Court to take a view opposite that of the RTC and the CA.<br><br>It is of particular significance to note that in her sworn statement to the police, AAA admitted that she first revealed her ordeal of sexual abuse to her cousin DDD in the afternoon of February 5, 2009, although her mother BBB had returned from her overnight guard duty that morning. Shocked by what AAA told him, DDD relayed to BBB “<i>na may problema [si AAA]</i>.” BBB thus confronted her, and AAA in her own words narrated that, “<i>kaya kinausap na po ako ni Mama kung ano ang problema ko kaya sinabi ko na po ang ginawa sa akin ni Papa ko po kaya nalaman na lahat ni Mama ang panggagahasa sa akin ni Papa</i>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>After an anguished silence of five years, finally AAA found the courage to reveal to her mother her heart-rending saga of sexual abuse by her own father. Emboldened by her cousin DDD’s moral support, AAA told her mother that she had been hiding her dark secret since Grade III. But as soon as BBB learned, events quickly took their logical course. With BBB now leading the way, BBB and AAA sought the help of the <i>barangay tanod</i> that same day between 5:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. to have the accused-appellant arrested. At around 6:00 p.m., they were able to arrest him as he was coming home. Later that night, AAA accompanied by BBB gave her statement to PO3 Cobardo of the PNP women’s desk.<br><br>AAA’s revelation to DDD and BBB set off an inexorable chain of events that led to the arrest of the accused-appellant. There is no doubt, however, that there was nothing spontaneous, unreflected or instinctive about the declarations which AAA made to the <i>barangay tanod</i> and later that night to the police. Her statements were in fact a re-telling of what she had already confessed to her mother earlier that afternoon; this time however, her story to the <i>tanods</i> and the police was in clear, conscious pursuit of a newly formed resolve, exhorted by her mother, to see her father finally exposed and put behind bars. AAA made her declarations to the authorities precisely because she was seeking their help to punish the accused-appellant. There was then nothing spontaneous about her so-called <i>res gestae</i> narrations, even as it is remarkable to note that while AAA was giving her said statements to the police, her father was already being held in detention, and the investigation was conducted exactly to determine if there was a basis to hold him for trial for rape.<br><br><i>Res gestae</i> speaks of a quick continuum of related happenings, starting with the occurrence of a startling event which triggered it and including any spontaneous declaration made by a witness, participant or spectator relative to the said occurrence. The cases this Court has cited invariably reiterate that the statement must be an unreflected reaction of the declarant, undesigned and free of deliberation. In other words, the declarant is spontaneously moved merely to express his instinctive reaction concerning the startling occurrence, and not to pursue a purpose or design already formed in his mind. In <i>People v. Sanchez</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> the Court belabored to explain that startling events “<i>speak for themselves, giving out their fullest meaning through the unprompted language of the participants</i>:”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><blockquote><i>Res gestae</i> means the “things done.” It “refers to those exclamations and statements made by either the participants, victims, or spectators to a crime immediately before, during, or immediately after the commission of the crime, when the circumstances are such that the statements were made as a spontaneous reaction or utterance inspired by the excitement of the occasion and there was no opportunity for the declarant to deliberate and to fabricate a false statement.” A spontaneous exclamation is defined as “a statement or exclamation made immediately after some exciting occasion by a participant or spectator and asserting the circumstances of that occasion as it is observed by him. The admissibility of such exclamation is based on our experience that, under certain external circumstances of physical or mental shock, a stress of nervous excitement may be produced in a spectator which stills the reflective faculties and removes their control, so that the utterance which then occurs is a spontaneous and sincere response to the actual sensations and perceptions already produced by the external shock. Since this utterance is made under the immediate and uncontrolled domination of the senses, rather than reason and reflection, and during the brief period when consideration of self-interest could not have been fully brought to bear,’ the utterance may be taken as expressing the real belief of the speaker as to the facts just observed by him.” In a manner of speaking, the spontaneity of the declaration is such that the declaration itself may be regarded as the event speaking through the declarant rather than the declarant speaking for himself. Or, stated differently, “x x x the events speak for themselves, giving out their fullest meaning through the unprompted language of the participants. The spontaneous character of the language is assumed to preclude the probability of its premeditation or fabrication.

This is error. It is obvious that AAA had by then undergone a serious deliberation, prodded by her mother, whose own outrage as the betrayed wife and grieving mother so emboldened AAA that she finally resolved to emerge from her fear of her father. Here then lies the crux of the matter: AAA had clearly ceased to act unthinkingly under the immediate influence of her shocking rape by her father, and was now led by another powerful compulsion, a new-found resolve to punish her father.<br><br><b>Hearsay evidence is accorded no probative value for the reason that the original declarant was not placed under oath or affirmation, nor subjected to cross-examination by the defense, except in a few instances as where the statement is considered part of the <i>res gestae</i>.</b><br><br>This Court has a situation where the incriminatory statements allegedly made by AAA were conveyed to the trial court not by AAA herself but by PO3 Cobardo, BSF Estudillo and BSF Perlas. In particular, PO3 Cobardo made a summation of what she claims was AAA’s narration of her ordeal, along with her own observations of her demeanor during the investigation. But unless the prosecution succeeded in invoking <i>res gestae</i>, their testimonies must be dismissed as hearsay, since AAA’s statements were not subjected to cross-examination consistent with the constitutional right of the accused-appellant to confront the evidence against him.<br><br>Hearsay testimony is devoid of probative value, and unless it is part of <i>res gestae</i>, the appealed decision runs contrary to the well-settled rule against admitting hearsay evidence, aptly described as “evidence not of what the witness knows himself but of what he has heard from others.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> The hearsay rule puts in issue the trustworthiness and reliability of hearsay evidence, since the statement testified to was not given under oath or solemn affirmation, and more compellingly, the declarant was not subjected to cross examination by the opposing party to test his perception, memory, veracity and articulateness, on whose reliability the entire worth of the out-of-court statement depends.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> It is an immemorial rule that a witness can testify only as to his own personal perception or knowledge of the actual facts or events.

There is no gainsaying that the right to confront a witness applies with particular urgency in criminal proceedings, for at stake is a man’s personal liberty, universally cherished among all human rights.<br><br>In <i>Patula v. People</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> the Court rendered a helpful disquisition on hearsay evidence, why it must be rejected and treated as inadmissible, and how it can be avoided:<br><blockquote>To elucidate why the Prosecution’s hearsay evidence was unreliable and untrustworthy, and thus devoid of probative value, reference is made to Section 36 of Rule 130, <i>Rules of Court</i>, a rule that states that a witness can testify only to those facts that she knows of her personal knowledge; that is, which are derived from her own perception, except as otherwise provided in the <i>Rules of Court</i>. The personal knowledge of a witness is a substantive prerequisite for accepting testimonial evidence that establishes the truth of a disputed fact. <b>A witness bereft of personal knowledge of the disputed fact cannot be called upon for that purpose because her testimony derives its value not from the credit accorded to her as a witness presently testifying but from the veracity and competency of the extrajudicial source of her information.</b><br><br>In case a witness is permitted to testify based on what she has heard another person say about the facts in dispute, the person from whom the witness derived the information on the facts in dispute is not <i>in court</i> and <i>under oath</i> to be examined and cross-examined. The weight of such testimony then depends not upon the veracity of the witness but upon the veracity of the other person giving the information to the witness without oath. The information cannot be tested because the declarant is not standing in court as a witness and cannot, therefore, be cross-examined.<br><br>It is apparent, too, that a person who relates a hearsay is not obliged to enter into any particular, to answer any question, to solve any difficulties, to reconcile any contradictions, to explain any obscurities, to remove any ambiguities; and that she entrenches herself in the simple assertion that she was told so, and leaves the burden entirely upon the dead or absent author. <b>Thus, the rule against hearsay testimony rests mainly on the ground that there was no opportunity to cross-examine the declarant. The testimony may have been given under oath and before a court of justice, but if it is offered against a party who is afforded no opportunity to cross-examine the witness, it is hearsay just the same.</b><br><br>Moreover, the theory of the hearsay rule is that when a human utterance is offered as evidence of the truth of the fact asserted, the credit of the assertor becomes the basis of inference, and, therefore, the assertion can be received as evidence only when made on the witness stand, subject to the test of cross-examination. However, if an extrajudicial utterance is offered, not as an assertion to prove the matter asserted but without reference to the truth of the matter asserted, the hearsay rule does not apply. For example, in a slander case, if a prosecution witness testifies that he heard the accused say that the complainant was a thief, this testimony is admissible not to prove that the complainant was really a thief, but merely to show that the accused uttered those words. This kind of utterance is hearsay in character but is not legal hearsay. The distinction is, therefore, between (<i>a</i>) the fact that the statement was made, to which the hearsay rule does not apply, and (<i>b</i>) the truth of the facts asserted in the statement, to which the hearsay rule applies.<br><br>Section 36, Rule 130 of the <i>Rules of Court</i> is understandably not the only rule that explains why testimony that is hearsay should be excluded from consideration. Excluding hearsay also aims to preserve the right of the opposing party to cross-examine the <i>original</i> declarant claiming to have a direct knowledge of the transaction or occurrence. If hearsay is allowed, the right stands to be denied because the declarant is not in court. It is then to be stressed that the right to cross-examine the adverse party’s witness, being the only means of testing the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies, is essential to the administration of justice.<br><br>To address the problem of controlling inadmissible hearsay as evidence to establish the truth in a dispute while also safeguarding a party’s right to cross-examine her adversary’s witness, the <i>Rules of Court</i> offers two solutions. The first solution is to require that <i>all</i> the witnesses in a judicial trial or hearing be examined only in court <i>under oath or affirmation</i>. Section 1, Rule 132 of the <i>Rules of Court</i> formalizes this solution, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>“Section 1. <i>Examination to be done in open court</i>.–The examination of witnesses presented in a trial or hearing shall be done in open court, and under oath or affirmation. Unless the witness is incapacitated to speak, or the question calls for a different mode of answer, the answers of the witness shall be given orally.”<br></blockquote>The second solution is to require that all witnesses be <i>subject to the cross-examination by the adverse party</i>. Section 6, Rule 132 of the <i>Rules of Court</i> ensures this solution thusly:<br><blockquote>“Section 6. <i>Cross-examination; its purpose and extent</i>.—Upon the termination of the direct examination, the witness may be cross-examined by the adverse party as to any matters stated in the direct examination, or connected therewith, with sufficient fullness and freedom to test his accuracy and truthfulness and freedom from interest or bias, or the reverse, and to elicit all important facts bearing upon the issue.”<br></blockquote>Although the second solution traces its existence to a Constitutional precept relevant to criminal cases,<i> i.e.</i>, Section 14, (2), Article III, of the 1987 <i>Constitution</i>, which guarantees that: “<i>In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall x x x enjoy the right x x x to meet the witnesses face to face x x x</i>,” the rule requiring the cross-examination by the adverse party equally applies to non-criminal proceedings.<br><br>We thus stress that the rule excluding hearsay as evidence is based upon serious concerns about the trustworthiness and reliability of hearsay evidence due to its not being given under oath or solemn affirmation and due to its not being subjected to cross-examination by the opposing counsel to test the perception, memory, veracity and articulateness of the out-of-court declarant or actor upon whose reliability the worth of the out of-court statement depends.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> (Citations omitted, emphasis ours and italics in the original)<br></blockquote><b>When inculpatory facts are susceptible of two or more interpretations, one of which is consistent with the innocence of the accused, the evidence does not fulfill or hurdle the test of moral certainty required for conviction.</b><br><br>It is well-settled, to the point of being elementary, that when inculpatory facts are susceptible to two or more interpretations, one of which is consistent with the innocence of the accused, the evidence does not fulfill or hurdle the test of moral certainty required for conviction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> A forced application of the <i>res gestae</i> exception below results if the Court says that AAA’s incriminatory statements were spontaneous and thus part of a <i>startling occurrence</i>. It produces an outright denial of the right of the accused-appellant to be presumed innocent unless proven guilty, not to mention that he was also denied his right to confront the complainant. As the Court held in <i>People v. Ganguso</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><blockquote>An accused has in his favor the presumption of innocence which the Bill of Rights guarantees. Unless his guilt is shown beyond reasonable doubt, he must be acquitted. This reasonable doubt standard is demanded by the due process clause of the Constitution which protects the accused from conviction except upon proof beyond reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged. The burden of proof is on the prosecution, and unless it discharges that burden the accused need not even offer evidence in his behalf, and he would be entitled to an acquittal. Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not, of course, mean such degree of proof as excluding the possibility of error, produces absolute certainty. Moral certainty only is required, or that degree of proof which produces conviction in an unprejudiced mind. The conscience must be satisfied that the accused is responsible for the offense charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>This Court’s views are not a condonation of the bestiality of the accused-appellant but only indicate that there is reasonable doubt as to his guilt entitling him to acquittal.
