In the column headed “Name[”] and “Address” shall be shown the words “Transferred from tobacco factory warehouse”. All leaf tobacco received into a factory must be entered in the official bale book pertaining to the factory and bales of leaf tobacco shall not be taken up in the L-7 register book until said bales are transferred for use and credited in the official bale book. While leaf tobacco must be taken in the official bale book, this is done for statistical purposes only. As soon as it enters the factory for use in manufacture it should be taken up in the L-7 register book and credited in the official bale book.<br><br>All removals of waste of tobacco, whether transferred to other factories, removed for agricultural or industrial purposes, or destroyed on the premises or elsewhere, shall be entered in the official register book, L-7, under the heading “Raw Materials Removed”, showing all information required therein.

It is a partially prepared tobacco. The removal of the stem or midrib from the leaf tobacco makes the resulting stemmed leaf tobacco a prepared or partially prepared tobacco. The following is La Suerte’s own illustration of how the stemmed leaf tobacco comes about: In the process of removing the stems, the whole leaf tobacco breaks into pieces; after the stems or midribs are removed, the tobacco is threshed (cut by machine into fine narrow strips) and then undergoes a process of redrying,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[160]</sup> undoubtedly showing that stemmed leaf tobacco is a partially prepared tobacco.<br><br>Since the Tax Code contained no definition of “partially prepared tobacco,” then the term should be construed in its general, ordinary, and comprehensive sense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[161]</sup><br><br>RR No. 17-67, as amended, supplements the law by delineating what products of tobacco are “prepared or manufactured” and “partially prepared or partially manufactured.” Section 2(m) states:<br><blockquote>(m)&nbsp; “Partially manufactured tobacco” — Includes:<br><br><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(1) </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">“Stemmed leaf” — handstripped tobacco, clean, good, partially broken leaf only, free from mold and dust.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(2)</div></td><td><div align="justify">“Long-filler” — handstripped tobacco of good, long pieces of broken leaf usable as filler for cigars without further preparation, and free from mold, dust stems and cigar cuttings.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(3)</div></td><td><div align="justify">“Short-filler” — handstripped or machine-stripped tobacco, clean, good, short pieces of broken leaf, which will not pass through a screen of two inches (2") mesh.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(4)</div></td><td><div align="justify">“Cigar-cuttings” — clean cuttings or clippings from cigars, unsized with any other form of tobacco.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(5)</div></td><td><div align="justify">“Machine-scrap tobacco” — machine-threshed, clean, good tobacco, not included in any of the above terms, usable in the manufacture of tobacco products.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(6) </div></td><td><div align="justify">“Stems” — midribs of leaf tobacco removed from the whole leaf or broken leaf either by hand or machine.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(7)</div></td><td><div align="justify">“Waste tobacco” — denatured tobacco; powder or dust, refuse, unfit for human consumption; discarded materials in the manufacture of tobacco products, which may include stems.<br></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>Insisting on the inapplicability of RR No. 17-67, La Suerte points to the different definitions given to stemmed leaf tobacco by Section 2(m)(1) of RR No. 17-67 and Section 137. It argues that while RR No. 17-67 defines stemmed leaf tobacco as handstripped tobacco of clean, good, <i>partially broken leaf only</i>, free from mold and dust, Section 137 defines it as leaf tobacco which has had the stem or midrib removed. <i>The term does not include broken leaf tobacco</i>. We are not convinced.<br><br>Different definitions of the term “stemmed leaf” are unavoidable, especially considering that Section 2(m)(1) is an implementing regulation of Act No. 2613, which was enacted in 1916 for purposes of <i>improving the quality</i> of Philippine tobacco products, while Section 137 defines the tobacco product only for the purpose of <i>exempting it from the specific tax</i>. Whichever definition is adopted, there is no doubt that stemmed leaf tobacco is a partially prepared tobacco.<br><br>The <i>onus</i> of proving that stemmed leaf tobacco is not subject to the specific tax lies with the cigarette manufacturers. Taxation is the rule, exemption is the exception.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[162]</sup> Accordingly, statutes granting tax exemptions must be construed in <i>strictissimi juris</i> against the taxpayer and liberally in favor of the taxing authority. The cigarette manufacturers must justify their claim by a clear and categorical provision in the law. Otherwise, they are liable for the specific tax on stemmed leaf tobacco found in their possession pursuant to Section 127<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[163]</sup> of the 1986 Tax Code, as amended.<br><br><b>Stemmed leaf tobacco transferred in bulk between cigarette manufacturers are exempt from excise tax under Section 137 of the 1986 Tax Code in conjunction with RR No. V-39 and RR No. 17-67</b><br><br>In the instant case, an exemption on the taxability of stemmed leaf tobacco is found in Section 137, which provides the following:<br><blockquote>SEC. 137.

Hence, the transferor and transferee of the stemmed leaf tobacco <i>must be</i> an L-7 tobacco manufacturer.<br><br><i>La Campaña</i> explained that the reason behind the tax exemption of stemmed leaf tobacco transferred between two L-7 manufacturers is that the same had already been previously taxed when acquired by the L-7 manufacturer from dealers of tobacco, thus:<br><blockquote>[T]he exemption from specific tax of the sale of stemmed leaf tobacco as raw material by one L-7 directly to another L-7 is because such stemmed leaf tobacco has been subjected to specific tax when an L-7 manufacturer purchased the same from wholesale leaf tobacco dealers designated under Section 3, Chapter I, Revenue Regulations No. 17-67 (<i>supra</i>) as L-3, L-3F, L-3R, L-4, or L-6, the latter being also a stripper of leaf tobacco. These are the sources of stemmed leaf tobacco to be used as raw materials by an L-7 manufacturer which does not produce stemmed leaf tobacco. When an L-7 manufacturer sells the stemmed leaf tobacco purchased from the foregoing suppliers to another L-7 manufacturer as raw material, such sale is not subject to specific tax under Section 137 (now Section 140), as implemented by Section 20(a) of Revenue Regulations No. V-39.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[167]</sup><br></blockquote>There is no new product when stemmed leaf tobacco is transferred between two L-7 permit holders. Thus, there can be no excise tax that will attach. The regulation, therefore, is reasonable and does not create a new statutory right.<br><br><b>RR Nos. V-39 and 17-67 did not exceed the allowable limits of legislative delegation&nbsp; </b><br><br>The cigarette manufacturers contend that the authority of the Department of Finance to prescribe conditions is merely procedural. Its rule-making power is only for the effective enforcement of the law, which implicitly rules out substantive modifications. The Secretary of Finance cannot, by mere regulation, limit the classes of manufacturers that may be entitled to the tax exemption. Otherwise, Section 137 (Section 132 in the 1939 Tax Code) would be invalid as an undue delegation of legislative power without the required standards or parameters.<br><br>The power of taxation is inherently legislative and may be imposed or revoked only by the legislature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[168]</sup> Moreover, this plenary power of taxation cannot be delegated by Congress to any other branch of government or private persons, unless its delegation is authorized by the Constitution itself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[169]</sup> Hence, the discretion to ascertain the following — (a) basis, amount, or rate of tax; (b) person or property that is subject to tax; (c) exemptions and exclusions from tax; and (d) manner of collecting the tax — may not be delegated away by Congress.<br><br>However, it is well-settled that the power to fill in the details and manner as to the enforcement and administration of a law may be delegated to various specialized administrative agencies like the Secretary of Finance in this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[170]</sup><br><br>This court in <i>Maceda v.

The reason is the increasing complexity of modern life and many technical fields of governmental functions as in matters pertaining to tax exemptions. This is coupled by the growing inability of the legislature to cope directly with the many problems demanding its attention. The growth of society has ramified its activities and created peculiar and sophisticated problems that the legislature cannot be expected reasonably to comprehend. Specialization even in legislation has become necessary. To many of the problems attendant upon present day undertakings, the legislature may not have the competence, let alone the interest and the time, to provide the required direct and efficacious, not to say specific solutions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[172]</sup><br></blockquote>Thus, rules and regulations implementing the law are designed to fill in the details or to make explicit what is general, which otherwise cannot all be incorporated in the provision of the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[173]</sup> Such rules and regulations, when promulgated in pursuance of the procedure or authority conferred upon the administrative agency by law,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[174]</sup> “deserve to be given weight and respect by the courts in view of the rule-making authority given to those who formulate them and their specific expertise in their respective fields.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[175]</sup> To be valid, a revenue regulation must be within the scope of statutory authority or standard granted by the legislature.

By an explicit provision in Section 132, the lawmakers defer to the Department of Finance to provide the details upon which the removal of stemmed leaf tobacco may be exempt from the specific tax in view of its supposed expertise in the tobacco trade. Section 20(a) of RR No. V-39 adhered to the standards because it provided the <i>conditions</i> — the proper documentation and recording of raw materials transferred from one factory to another — for a tax-free removal of stemmed leaf tobacco, without negating the imposition of specific tax under Section 137. The “effective enforcement of the provisions of [the Tax Code]” in Section 338 provides a sufficient standard for the Secretary of Finance in determining the <i>conditions</i> for the tax-free removal of stemmed leaf tobacco. Section 4 further provides a limitation on the contents of revenue regulations to be issued by the Secretary of Finance.<br><br>On the other hand, RR No. 17-67 was promulgated “[i]n accordance with the provisions of Section 79 (B) of the Administrative Code, as amended by Act No. 2803.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[184]</sup> Among the specific administrative powers conferred upon a department head under the Administrative Code is that of promulgating rules and regulations, not contrary to law, “necessary to regulate the proper working and harmonious and efficient administration of each and all of the offices and dependencies of his Department, and <i>for the strict enforcement and proper execution of the laws relative to matters under the jurisdiction of said Department</i>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[185]</sup> Under the 1939 Tax Code, the Secretary of Finance is authorized to prescribe regulations affecting the business of persons dealing in articles subject to specific tax, including the mode in which the processes of production of tobacco and tobacco products should be conducted and the records to be kept by manufacturers. Clearly then, the provisions of RR No. 17-67 classifying and regulating the business of persons dealing in tobacco and tobacco products are within the rule-making authority of the Secretary of Finance.<br><br><b>RR No. 17-67 did not create a new classification</b><br><br>The contention of the cigarette manufacturers that RR No. 17-67 unduly restricted the meaning of manufacturers of tobacco products by limiting it to a few manufacturers such as manufacturers of cigars and cigarettes is misleading.<br><br>The definitions in RR No. 17-67 of “manufacturer of tobacco” and “manufacturer of cigars and/or cigarettes” are in conformity with, as in fact they are verbatim adoptions of, the definitions under Section 194(m) and (n) of the 1939 Tax Code.<br><br>The cigarette companies further argue that RR No. 17-67 unduly restricted the meaning of L-7 in Section 20(a) of RR No. V-39 because when RR No. V-39 was issued, there was no distinction at all between L-7, L-3, L-6 permittees, and L-7 referred to manufacturers of any class of tobacco products including stemmed leaf tobacco.<br><br>This argument is similarly misplaced.<br><br>A reading of the entire RR No. V-39 shows that the regulation pertains particularly to activities of manufacturers of smoking and chewing tobacco, cigars and cigarettes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[186]</sup> This was rightly so because the regulation was issued to enforce the tax law provisions in relation to the <i>manufacture</i> and <i>importation</i> of tobacco products. Clearly apparent in Section 10(a) is that when a manufacturer of chewing and smoking tobacco, cigars, or cigarettes has been qualified to conduct his or her business as such, he or she is issued by the internal revenue agent the corresponding register books and auxiliary register books pertaining to his business as well as the official register book, L-7, to be used as record of the raw materials for his or her product. It is, therefore, logical to conclude that the L-7 invoice and L-7 register book under Section 20(a) refers to those invoice and books used by manufacturers of chewing and smoking tobacco, cigars or cigarettes.<br><br>RR No. 17-67 clarified RR No. V-39 by explicitly designating the manufacturers of tobacco products as L-7 permittees (Section 2), in contrast to wholesale leaf tobacco dealers and those that process partially manufactured tobacco such as stemmed leaf tobacco. RR No. 17-67 did not create a new and restrictive classification but only expressed in clear and categorical terms the distinctions between “manufacturers” and “dealers” of tobacco that were already implicit in RR No. V-39.<br><br>Indeed, there is no repugnancy between RR No. 17-67 and RR No. V-39, on the one hand, and the Tax Code, on the other. It is safer to presume that the term “manufacturer” used in Section 137 on tax exempt removals referred to an entity that is engaged in the business of, and was licensed by the Bureau of Internal Revenue as a, manufacturer of tobacco products. It does not include an entity engaged in business as a dealer in tobacco that, incidentally or in furtherance of its business as a dealer, strip or thresh whole leaf tobacco or reprocess partially manufactured tobacco.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[187]</sup><br><br>Such construction is consistent with the rule that tax exemptions, deemed to be in derogation of the state’s sovereign right of taxation, are strictly applied and may be granted only under clear and unmistakable terms of the law and not merely upon a vague implication or inference.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[188]</sup><br><br><b>RR No. V-39 must be applied and read together with RR No. 17-67&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </b><br><br>The cigarette manufacturers’ argument is misplaced, stating that RR No. 17-67 could not modify RR No. V-39 because it was promulgated to enforce Act No. 2613, as amended (entitled “An Act to Improve the Methods of Production and the Quality of Tobacco in the Philippines and to Develop the Export Trade Therein”), which allegedly had nothing whatsoever to do with the Tax Code or with the imposition of taxes.<br><br>“The Tobacco Inspection Service, instituted under Act No. 2613, was made part of the Bureau of Internal Revenue and Bureau of Customs administration for . . . internal revenue purposes.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[189]</sup> The Collector of Internal Revenue was charged to enforce Act No. 2613, otherwise known as the Tobacco Inspection Law, with a view to promoting the Philippine tobacco trade and thereby increase the revenues of the government.

Furthermore, the questioned Revenue Memorandum Circular was also issued to apprise those con­cerned of the construction and interpretation which should be accorded to Act No. 2613, as amended, and which respondent is duty bound to enforce. It is an opinion on how the law should be construed and there was no attempt whatsoever to enlarge or restrict the meaning of the law.<br><br>The basis for the issuance of said Memorandum Circular was so stated in Resolution No. 2-67 of the Tobacco Board, wherein petitioners as members of the Manila Tobacco Association, Inc. were duly represen­ted, the pertinent portions of which read:<br><blockquote>“. . . .<br><br>WHEREAS, this original recommenda­tion of Mr. Hernandez was perfectly in accordance with existing law, more par­ticularly Sec. 1 of Republic Act No. 31 which took effect since September 25, 1946, but perhaps <i>thru oversight</i> by the former Commissioners and officers of the Tobacco Inspection Service <i>the propriety and legality of effecting the inspection of tobacco products for local sales</i> and imported leaf tobacco for factory use <i>might have overlooked resulting in huge losses of tobacco inspection fees</i> . . .” (Italics supplied)<br><br>. . . .<br></blockquote>Tobacco Inspection fees are undoubtedly National Internal Revenue taxes, they being one of the miscellaneous taxes provided for under the Tax Code. Section 228 (formerly Section 302) of Chapter VII of the Code specifically provides for the collection and manner of payment of the said inspection fees. It is within the power and duty of the Commissioner to collect the same, even without inspection, should tobacco products be re­moved clandestinely or surreptitiously from the estab­lishment of the wholesaler, manufacturer or redrying plant and from the customs custody in case of imported leaf tobacco. <i>Errors, omissions or flaws committed by BIR inspectors and representatives while in the performance of their duties cannot be set up as estoppel nor estop the Government from collecting a tax legally due</i>. Tobacco inspection fees are levied and collected for purposes of regulation and control and also as a source of revenue since fifty percentum (50%) of said fees shall accrue to the Tobacco Inspection Fee Fund created by Sec. 12 of Act No. 2613, as amended and the other fifty percentum, to the Cultural Center of the Philippines. (Sec. 88, Chapter VII, NIRC)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[202]</sup> (Emphasis in this paragraph supplied, citation omitted)<br></blockquote>Furthermore, the December 12, 1972 ruling of Commissioner Misael P. Vera runs counter to Section 20(a) of RR No. V-39 in relation to RR No. 17-67, which provides that only transfers of stemmed leaf tobacco between L-7 permittees are exempt. An implementing regulation cannot be superseded by a ruling which is a mere interpretation of the law. While opinions and rulings of officials of the government called upon to execute or implement administrative laws command much respect and weight, courts are not bound to accept the same if they override, instead of remain consistent and in harmony with, the law they seek to apply and implement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[203]</sup><br><br><b>Double taxation</b><br><br>The contention that the cigarette manufacturers are doubly taxed because they are paying the specific tax on the raw material and on the finished product in which the raw material was a part is also devoid of merit.<br><br>For double taxation in the objectionable or prohibited sense to exist, “the same property must be taxed twice, when it should be taxed but once.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[204]</sup> “[B]oth taxes must be imposed on the same property or subject- matter, for the same purpose, by the same . . . taxing authority, within the same jurisdiction or taxing district, during the same taxing period, and they must be the same kind or character of tax.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[205]</sup><br><br>At all events, there is no constitutional prohibition against double taxation in the Philippines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[206]</sup> This court has explained in <i>Pepsi-Cola Bottling Company of the Philippines, Inc. v.

The reason is that the State has exclusively reserved the same for its own prerogative. <i>Moreover, double taxation, in general, is not forbidden by our fundamental law, since We have not adopted as part thereof the injunction against double taxation found in the Constitution of the United States and some states of the Union.</i> Double taxation becomes obnoxious only where the taxpayer is taxed twice for the benefit of the same governmental entity or by the same jurisdiction for the same purpose, but not in a case where one tax is imposed by the State and the other by the city or municipality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[208]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)<br></blockquote>“It is something not favored, but is permissible, provided some other constitutional requirement is not thereby violated, such as the requirement that taxes must be uniform.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[209]</sup><br><br>Excise taxes are essentially taxes on property<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[210]</sup> because they are levied on certain specified goods or articles manufactured or produced in the Philippines for domestic sale or consumption or for any other disposition, and on goods imported.

Purisima, Third Division] involved the proper application of the proviso in Section 168 of the old Tax Code: “That credit for any sales, miller's or excise taxes paid on raw materials or supplies used in the milling process shall not be allowed against the miller's tax due, except in the case of a proprietor or operator of a refined sugar factory as provided hereunder." This court, <i>citing Mustang Lumber, Inc. v. Court of Appeals</i>, 327 Phil. 214, 235 (1996) [Per J. Davide, Jr., En Banc], stated: “It is a basic rule of interpretation that words and phrases used in the statute, in the absence of a clear legislative intent to the contrary, should be given their plain, ordinary and common usage or meaning.” Construing the term “raw materials” in its ordinary sense, this court held that the sales, miller's and excise taxes paid on containers and packaging materials are not raw materials of the milled products under consideration and, thus, may be credited against the miller's tax due. It further declared, <span style="font-style: italic;">citing</span> <i>Samson v. Court of Appeals</i>, 230 Phil. 59, 64 (1986) [Per J. Alampay, Second Division]: “Under the rules of statutory construction, exceptions, as a general rule, should be strictly but reasonably construed. They extend only so far as their language fairly warrants, and all doubts should be resolved in favor of the general provisions rather than the exception. Where a general rule is established by statute with exceptions, the court will not curtail the former nor add to the latter by implication. . . .” Conformably, it held that “[t]he exception provided for in Section 168 of the old Tax Code should thus be strictly construed.”<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[162]</sup> <i>Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) v.
