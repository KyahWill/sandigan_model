“Her simple recollection of the acts done to her by accused-appellant evinces sincerity and truthfulness. . . .&nbsp; A woman with a mental age of that of a six year old child [as testified to by a National Bureau of Investigation psychologist] could not possibly concoct an accusation as serious as rape against . . . accused or at any one for that matter.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp;

Moreover, accused did not show proof that would substantiate his claim that he was in a relationship with AAA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; In any case, the existence of a romantic relationship does not justify such force upon a party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals modified the maximum penalty in Criminal Case No. 07-0873 to 10 years of <i>prision mayor</i>.&nbsp;

These include AAA’s failure to disclose that accused employed force or intimidation against her.&nbsp; She never mentioned that accused was in any occasion carrying a deadly weapon, uttering threats, or subjecting AAA to physical violence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>&nbsp; Force and intimidation are elements of the crime of rape under Article 355, paragraph 1 of the Revised Penal Code, in relation to Republic Act No. 7659.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Accused also emphasized that AAA did not offer resistance or attempted to flee despite accused’s lack of weapon to intimidate her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; She did not tell accused to stop when accused allegedly removed her undergarments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Accused pointed out the closeness of the houses in the locality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>&nbsp; The incident also happened in broad daylight inside AAA’s house where she lived with six other family members.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>&nbsp; These circumstances made it improbable for AAA not to make an outcry.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the prosecution’s act of having to recall AAA to the witness stand so that she could testify to 1) the alleged threats that accused made to her and 2) the alleged fact that she wept after the incident reflects the weakness of AAA’s initial testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>&nbsp; It was clearly an “attempt to make out a stronger rape case.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>&nbsp; She could have alleged those if it were true in her <i>sinumpaang salaysay</i> and during her direct testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Lastly, accused argued that he and AAA were sweethearts who were engaged in sexual intimacies, and the charges against him were mere responses to their break-up.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>We affirm accused’s conviction.<br><br><b><center>I</center><br>Trial courts are in the best position<br>to evaluate witnesses’ credibility</b><br><br>Both the trial court and the Court of Appeals found AAA’s testimony to be credible and convincing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>&nbsp; There is no reason to disturb this finding.<br><br>The observance of the witnesses’ demeanor during an oral direct examination, cross-examination, and during the entire period that he or she is present during trial is indispensable especially in rape cases because it helps establish the moral conviction that an accused is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged.&nbsp; Trial provides judges with the opportunity to detect, consciously or unconsciously, observable cues and microexpressions that could, more than the words said and taken as a whole, suggest sincerity or betray lies and ill will.&nbsp; These important aspects can never be reflected or reproduced in documents and objects used as evidence.<br><br>Hence, “[t]he evaluation of the witnesses’ credibility is a matter best left to the trial court because it has the opportunity to observe the witnesses and their demeanor during the trial.&nbsp; Thus, the Court accords great respect to the trial court’s findings,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> more so when the Court of Appeals affirmed such findings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>The exception is when the trial court and/or the Court of Appeals “overlooked or misconstrued substantial facts that could have affected the outcome of the case.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>&nbsp; No such facts were overlooked or misconstrued in this case.<br><br><center><b>II.</b></center><br><br><b>The intellectual disability of the witness <br>does not make her testimony incredible, <br>especially when corroborated by other <br>evidence</b><br><br>When a victim’s testimony is credible and sufficiently establishes the elements of the crime, it may be enough basis to convict an accused of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code provides:<br><br><blockquote>Art. 266-A. <i>Rape, When and How Committed.</i> – Rape is committed –<br><br>1) By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:<br><blockquote>a. Through force, threat or intimidation;<br>b. When the offended party is deprived of reason or is otherwise unconscious;<br>c. By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority;<br>d. When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present;<br></blockquote>2) By any person who, under any of the circumstances mentioned in paragraph 1 hereof, shall commit an act of sexual assault by inserting his penis into another person’s mouth or anal orifice, or any instrument or object, into the genital or anal orifice of another person (<i>Republic Act No. 8353 which took effect on October 22, 1997</i>).</blockquote><br>Thus, to be convicted of rape under Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code, it only needs to be shown that a man had carnal knowledge with a woman, or a person sexually assaulted another, under any of the following circumstances:<br><br><blockquote>a) Through force, threat or intimidation;<br>b) The victim is deprived of reason;<br>c) The victim is unconscious;<br>d) By means of fraudulent machination;<br>e) By means of grave abuse of authority;<br>f)&nbsp; When the victim is under 12 years of age; or<br>g) When the victim is demented.</blockquote><br>In this case, AAA made a spontaneous and unadorned testimony in court about the fact, the manner, and the circumstances of the male accused’s sexual intercourse with her over a period of days.&nbsp; She was also able to positively identify the accused, when asked.&nbsp; Thus:<br><br><blockquote>Q: When accused followed you to the bathroom what happened?<br><br>A: He removed his short and underwear, Ma’am.<br><br>Q: And, what did he do after he removed his short and underwear?<br><br>A: He inserted, Ma’am.<br><br>Q: What did he insert?<br><br>A: His penis, Ma’am.<br><br>Q: And, where did he insert his penis?<br><br>A: In my vagina, Ma’am.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>Q: And, what happened on that another incident?<br><br>A: On a Tuesday he kissed me on the lips and held my breast, Ma’am.<br><br>Q: And, after that incident on a Tuesday, what else happened?<br><br>A: On a Thursday he waited on me downstairs when it was already dark, Ma’am.<br><br>Q: What did you do on that Thursday incident?<br><br>A: He let me swallowed, Ma’am.<br><br>Q: Who in particular let you swallowed something?<br><br>A: Eric, Ma’am.<br><br>Q: Are you referring to Eric the same accused who repeatedly inserted his penis into your vagina?<br><br>A: It is him, Ma’am.<br><br>. . . .<br><br><b>Q: Who let you swallow that “something”?<br><br>A: Eric, Ma’am.<br><br>Q: Please point to Eric if he is in this Courtroom.<br><br>RECORD: (Witness is pointing to a man wearing a yellow shirt and when asked his name answered, Enrique Quintos.)</b><br><br>Q: And, you said that the accused made you swallowed.

Sion: Madam Witness, will you please be more precise in informing this Honorable Court on the various tests which you conducted upon the person of the victim. . .?<br><br>Witness: I conducted the standard intelligence scale to determine the mental and emotional capacity of the individual, ma’am.<br><br>Q: Other than that kind of test, what other tests were conducted upon the victim?<br><br>A: I also gave her the draw-a-person test and battery of tests, ma’am.<br><br>Q: What were the purposes or the goals of these kinds of tests conducted upon the said victim?<br><br>A: The purpose of all these tests is to have a general assessment of the mental and emotional capacity of an individual and also these tests determine mental illness, ma’am.<br><br>Q: These kinds of tests that you resulted to which you employed upon the victim, are these tests the standard method being used all over to be able to specifically evaluate the mental competence and incompetence of a certain person?<br><br>A: Yes, ma’am.<br><br>Q: For how long did you conduct this psychiatric examination upon the said victim?<br><br>A: I conducted the tests on the same day when the victim was referred to me, ma’am. I started it in the morning until late in the afternoon. And we also asked for the victim to come back.<br><br>Q: So, for how much time was required for you to completely terminate and fully satisfied that you have completed this neuro-psychiatric examination upon the said victim?<br><br>A: For exactly one week, ma’am.<br><br>Q: As a result of the examination that you conducted upon the victim, what was the findings which yielded from said examination?<br><br>A: <i>In the conclusion which I made, it was found out that the victim is suffering from mental retardation, her IQ is 38 and her mental age is 6 years and two months, ma’am.</i><br><br>Q. How old was the victim at that time that you conducted this psychiatric examination?<br><br>A: <i>She was 21 years old, ma’am</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>AAA's mental condition does not make her testimony incredible as long as she can recount her experience in a straightforward, spontaneous, and believable manner.&nbsp; In <i>People v. Monticalvo</i>, this court said the following:<br><br><blockquote>Competence and credibility of mentally deficient rape victims as witnesses have been upheld by this Court where it is shown that they can communicate their ordeal capable and consistently. Rather than undermine the gravity of the complainant's accusations, it even lends greater credence to her testimony, that, someone as feeble-minded and guileless could speak so tenaciously and explicitly on the details of the rape if she has not in fact suffered such crime at the hands of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup></blockquote><br>AAA’s testimony was corroborated by the medical findings, which showed that there were lacerations in her hymen that were produced by a blunt object.&nbsp; The testimonial evidence is bolstered by the presence of these lacerations.&nbsp; Together, they produce a moral conviction that accused committed the crimes charged.<br><br>The presence of lacerations is not an element of the crime of rape.&nbsp; This court previously characterized the presence or absence of lacerations as a "trivial or inconsequential [matter] that does not alter the essential fact of the commission of rape."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup>&nbsp; The presence of lacerations is, therefore, not necessary to sustain a conviction.&nbsp; An accused may be found guilty of rape regardless of the existence or inexistence of lacerations.&nbsp; The absence of lacerations is not a sufficient defense.<br><br>However, the presence of lacerations may be used to sustain conviction of an accused by corroborating testimonies of abuse and documents showing trauma upon the victim's genitals.<br><br>In this case, the medical evidence of lacerations supported AAA’s testimony that she was sexually abused.&nbsp; It was not necessary to convict accused, but it strengthened AAA's testimony and the moral certainty that accused was guilty of the crimes charged.<br><br><b><center>III</center><br>The existence of a relationship <br>between accused and the victim<br>does not negate rape</b><br><br>Accused’s argument that he and AAA were sweethearts is irrelevant in rape cases wherein the main element is “lack of consent.”&nbsp; Regardless of the relationship between two individuals, forcing carnal knowledge upon another is considered rape, more so when the victim is incapable of giving consent due to her mental capacity.&nbsp; Even married couples, upon whom the law imposes the duty to cohabitate, are protected from forced sexual congress.<br><br>Rape, as now defined in Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code, does not make a distinction with regard to an accused's relationship with the victim.&nbsp; It only requires that sexual congress be forced by a man upon another person.&nbsp; Moreover, Republic Act No. 9262 recognizes that wives, former wives, co-parents, and sweethearts may be raped by their husbands, former husbands, co-parents, or sweethearts by stating that committing acts of rape against these persons are considered violence against women. Republic Act No. 9262 provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 3. <i>Definition of Terms</i>. -- As used in this Act,<br><br><i>(a) "Violence against women and their children"</i> refers to any act or a series of acts committed by any person against a woman who is his wife former wife, or against a woman with whom the person has or had a sexual or dating relationship, or with whom he has a common child . . . which result in or is likely to result in <i>physical, sexual, psychological harm or suffering, </i>or economic abuse. . . .<br><br>. . . .<br><br>B. <i>"Sexual violence" refers to an act which is sexual in nature, committed against a woman or her child.</i> It includes, but is not limited to:<br><br>a) <i>rape</i>, sexual harrassment, acts of lasciviousness . . . (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Further, we discussed marital rape in <i>People v. Jumawan</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup>&nbsp; We said:<br><br><blockquote>Husbands do not have property rights over their wives' bodies. Sexual intercourse, albeit within the realm of marriage, if not consensual, is rape.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>Clearly, it is now acknowledged that rape, as a form of sexual violence, exists within marriage. A man who penetrates her wife without her consent or against her will commits sexual violence upon her, and the Philippines, as a State Party to the CEDAW and its accompanying Declaration, defines and penalizes the act as rape under R.A. No. 8353.<br><br>A woman is no longer the chattel-antiquated practices labeled her to be. A husband who has sexual intercourse with his wife is not merely using a property, he is fulfilling a marital consortium with a fellow human being with dignity equal to that he accords himself. He cannot be permitted to violate this dignity by coercing her to engage in a sexual act without her full and free consent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup></blockquote><br><br><b><center>IV</center><br>Absence of resistance does not, by<br>itself, establish consent</b><br><br>Accused’s allegation that AAA did not resist his advances was belied by AAA’s testimony that accused threatened the lives of her mother and siblings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup>&nbsp; This is intimidation that could explain AAA’s alleged lack of resistance.<br><br>In any case, resistance is not an element of the crime of rape.&nbsp; It need not be shown by the prosecution.&nbsp; Neither is it necessary to convict an accused.&nbsp; The main element of rape is “lack of consent.”<br><br>“Consent,” “resistance,” and “absence of resistance” are different things.&nbsp; Consent implies agreement and voluntariness.&nbsp; It implies willfulness.&nbsp; Similarly, resistance is an act of will.&nbsp; However, it implies the opposite of consent.&nbsp; It implies disagreement.<br><br>Meanwhile, absence of resistance only implies passivity.&nbsp; It may be a product of one’s will.&nbsp; It may imply consent.&nbsp; However, it may also be the product of force, intimidation, manipulation, and other external forces.<br><br>Thus, when a person resists another’s sexual advances, it would not be presumptuous to say that that person does not consent to any sexual activity with the other.&nbsp; That resistance may establish lack of consent.&nbsp; Sexual congress with a person who expressed her resistance by words or deeds constitutes force either physically or psychologically through threat or intimidation.&nbsp; It is rape.<br><br>Lack of resistance may sometimes imply consent.&nbsp; However, that is not always the case.&nbsp; While it may imply consent, there are circumstances that may render a person unable to express her resistance to another’s sexual advances.&nbsp; Thus, when a person has carnal knowledge with another person who does not show any resistance, it does not always mean that that person consented to such act.&nbsp; Lack of resistance does not negate rape.<br><br>Hence, Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code does not simply say that rape is committed when a man has carnal knowledge with or sexually assaults another by means of force, threat, or intimidation.&nbsp; It enumerates at least four other circumstances under which rape may be committed: (1) by taking advantage of a person’s deprived reason or unconscious state; (2) through fraudulent machination; (3) by taking advantage of a person’s age (12 years of age) or demented status; and (4) through grave abuse of authority.&nbsp; Article 266-A recognizes that rape can happen even in circumstances when there is no resistance from the victim.<br><br>Resistance, therefore, is not necessary to establish rape, especially when the victim is unconscious, deprived of reason, manipulated, demented, or young either in chronological age or mental age.<br><br>The circumstances when rape may be committed under Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code should be defined in terms of the capacity of an individual to give consent.&nbsp; An unconscious person cannot rationally respond to stimuli or perform acts such as giving consent or offering resistance because he or she is either unaware, asleep, or in a coma.<br><br>Meanwhile, when a person is a victim of fraudulent machination or manipulation, such as when she is induced to have carnal knowledge to treat a person’s disease that he or she does not really have, she is not in full control of his or her decisions.&nbsp; He or she acts without full or with false knowledge of the circumstances from which he or she bases his or her actions.&nbsp; Therefore, any consent he or she gives is either false or not his or her own.&nbsp; Any lack of resistance may not be interpreted as voluntariness.<br><br>The term, “deprived of reason,” is associated with insanity or madness.&nbsp; A person deprived of reason has mental abnormalities that affect his or her reasoning and perception of reality and, therefore, his or her capacity to resist, make decisions, and give consent.<br><br>The term, “demented,” refers to a person who suffers from a mental condition called dementia.&nbsp; Dementia refers to the deterioration or loss of mental functions such as memory, learning, speaking, and social condition, which impairs one’s independence in everyday activities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>We are aware that the terms, “mental retardation” or “intellectual disability,” had been classified under “deprived of reason.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup>&nbsp; The terms, “deprived of reason” and “demented”, however, should be differentiated from the term, “mentally retarded” or “intellectually disabled.”&nbsp; An intellectually disabled person is not necessarily deprived of reason or demented. This court had even ruled that they may be credible witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup>&nbsp; However, his or her maturity is not there despite the physical age.&nbsp; He or she is deficient in general mental abilities and has an impaired conceptual, social, and practical functioning relative to his or her age, gender, and peers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup>&nbsp; Because of such impairment, he or she does not meet the “socio-cultural standards of personal independence and social responsibility.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>Thus, a person with a chronological age of 7 years and a normal mental age is as capable of making decisions and giving consent as a person with a chronological age of 35 and a mental age of 7.&nbsp; Both are considered incapable of giving rational consent because both are not yet considered to have reached the level of maturity that gives them the capability to make rational decisions, especially on matters involving sexuality.&nbsp; Decision-making is a function of the mind.&nbsp; Hence, a person’s capacity to decide whether to give consent or to express resistance to an adult activity is determined not by his or her chronological age but by his or her mental age.&nbsp; Therefore, in determining whether a person is “twelve (12) years of age” under Article 266-A(1)(d), the interpretation should be in accordance with either the chronological age of the child if he or she is not suffering from intellectual disability, or the mental age if intellectual disability is established.<br><br>In all the above circumstances, rape is ensured because the victim lacks the awareness or presence of mind to resist a sexual abuse.&nbsp; The unconscious, the manipulated, the reason-deprived, the demented, and the young cannot be expected to offer resistance to sexual abuse for the simple reason that their mental statuses render them incapable of doing so.&nbsp; They are incapable of rational consent.&nbsp; Thus, sexual intercourse with them is rape.&nbsp; No evidence of force, intimidation, or resistance is necessary.<br><br>In this case, the victim, AAA, is intellectually disabled, with a mental age of 6 years and 2 months at 21 years of chronological age and an IQ of 38 at the time of the incident.&nbsp; Her capacity to give consent is only that of a 6-year-and 2-month-old child.&nbsp; She is incapable of giving rational consent to a sexual act.&nbsp; Any sexual intercourse with her, regardless of her relationship with accused and the presence or absence of resistance, is considered rape.&nbsp; In <i>People v. Butiong,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> this court said:<br><br><blockquote>Carnal knowledge of a mental retardate is rape under paragraph 1 of Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 8353 because a mental retardate is not capable of giving her consent to a sexual act. Proof of force or intimidation is not necessary, it being sufficient for the State to establish, one, the sexual congress between the accused and the victim, and, two, the mental retardation of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup></blockquote><br>Similarly, in <i>People v. Monticalvo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> this court said:<br><br><blockquote>The gravamen of the crime of rape under Art. 266-A(1) is sexual intercourse with a woman against her will or without her consent. . . .<br><br>. . . [F]or the charge of rape to prosper, the prosecution must prove that the offender had carnal knowledge of a woman through any of the four enumerated circumstances. Without doubt, carnal knowledge of a woman who is a mental retardate is rape under the aforesaid provisions of law. Proof of force or intimidation is not necessary as a mental retardate is not capable of giving consent to a sexual act. What needs to be proved are the facts of sexual congress between the accused and the victim, and the mental retardation of the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup></blockquote><br>For the same reason that AAA was incapable of giving her consent, forcing her to take one’s genitals inside her mouth is rape under Article 266-A(2) regardless of the existence of or lack of consent.<br><br>The classifications of rape in Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code are relevant only insofar as these define the manners of commission of rape.&nbsp; However, it does not mean that one manner is less heinous or wrong than the other.&nbsp; Whether rape is committed by nonconsensual carnal knowledge of a woman or by insertion of the penis into the mouth of another person, the damage to the victim’s dignity is incalculable.&nbsp; Child sexual abuse in general has been associated with negative psychological impacts such as trauma, sustained fearfulness, anxiety, self-destructive behavior, emotional pain, impaired sense of self, and interpersonal difficulties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup>&nbsp; Hence, one experience of sexual abuse should not be trivialized just because it was committed in a relatively unusual manner.<br><br>“The prime purpose of [a] criminal action is to punish the offender in order to deter him and others from committing the same or similar offense, to isolate him from society, reform and rehabilitate him or, in general, to maintain social order.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup>&nbsp; Crimes are punished as retribution so that society would understand that the act punished was wrong.<br><br>Imposing different penalties for different manners of committing rape creates a message that one experience of rape is relatively trivial or less serious than another.&nbsp; It attaches different levels of wrongfulness to equally degrading acts.&nbsp; Rape, in whatever manner, is a desecration of a person’s will and body.&nbsp; In terms of penalties, treating one manner of committing rape as greater or less in heinousness than another may be of doubtful constitutionality.<br><br>However, the discriminatory treatment of these two acts with the same result was not raised in this case.&nbsp; Acknowledging that every presumption must be accorded in favor of accused in criminal cases, we have no choice but to impose a lesser penalty for rape committed by inserting the penis into the mouth of the victim.<br><br><b><center>V</center><br>The victim’s mental incapacity need<br>not be alleged in the information in <br>order to convict an accused of the <br>crime of rape as long as evidence <br>established such incapacity</b><br><br>Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code provides that rape under paragraph 1 of Article 266-A is punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua.</i><br><br>The information charging accused of this crime lacked the allegation of any mental disability on the part of AAA.&nbsp; This is not necessary to convict accused of the crime of rape provided that sexual congress and mental incapacity and, therefore, the incapacity to give consent, are proved by clear and convincing evidence.<br><br>However, to qualify the crime of rape and increase the penalty of accused from <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death under Article 266-B in relation to Article 266-(A)(1) of the Revised Penal Code, an allegation of the victim's intellectual disability must be alleged in the information.&nbsp; If not alleged in the information, such mental incapacity may prove lack of consent but it cannot increase the penalty to death.&nbsp; Neither can it be the basis of conviction for statutory rape.<br><br>In this case, the elements of sexual congress and lack of consent were sufficiently alleged in the information.&nbsp; They were also clearly and conveniently determined during trial.&nbsp; The fact of being mentally incapacitated was only shown to prove AAA's incapacity to give consent, not to qualify the crime of rape.<br><br>Thus, the Court of Appeals is correct in affirming the trial court’s decision to impose the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and not death in Criminal Case No. 07-0874.<br><br>Article 266-B also provides that rape under paragraph 2 of Article 266-A is punishable by <i>prision mayor.</i>&nbsp; Applying Act No. 4103 or the Indeterminate Sentence Law, and considering that there were no attending circumstances that should be considered, accused’s penalty in Criminal Case No. 07-0873 should be “within the range of penalty next lower to [prision mayor]” or <i>prision correccional </i>in its maximum period as minimum, and <i>prision mayor </i>in its medium period as maximum.&nbsp; <i>Prision correccional</i> in its maximum period has a range of 4 years, 2 months and 1 day to 6 years.&nbsp; <i>Prision mayor </i>in its medium period has a range of 8 years and 1 day to 10 years.&nbsp; Since the penalty imposed by the trial court exceeds by one day the allowable penalty for the offenses committed, the Court of Appeals was correct in removing that excess.<br><br>This court had not hesitated to increase the awards of damages in crimes of utter heinousness and depravity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, we increase the awards for moral damages, civil indemnity, and exemplary damages to ?100,000.00 each, and for each count of rape.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Court of Appeals finding accused Enrique Quintos <i>y</i> Badilla guilty of two counts of rape is <b>AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION.</b>&nbsp;
