These requirements are explicitly stated in Section 20 (A) (1) thereof, which reads:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 20. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS<br><ol type="A"><li> COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS FOR DEATH<br><br><ol><li>In the case of <b>work-related death</b> of the seafarer, <b>during the term of his contract</b> the employer shall pay his beneficiaries the Philippine Currency equivalent to the amount of Fifty Thousand US dollars (US$50,000) and an additional amount of Seven Thousand US dollars (US$7,000) to each child under the age of twenty-one (21) but not exceeding four (4) children, at the exchange rate prevailing during the time of payment. (Emphases supplied)<br></li></ol></li></ol></blockquote><br>After an assiduous examination of the records, and as will be expounded on below, the Court, similar to both the LA and the NLRC, finds that the above-stated requirements positively attend petitioner’s claim for death benefits.<br><br><center><b><u>I. The Death of the Seafarer is Work-Related.&nbsp; </u></b></center><br>In the recent case of <i>Canuel v. Magsaysay Maritime Corporation</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> (<i>Canuel</i>), the Court clarified that the term “work-related death” refers to the seafarer’s death resulting from a work-related injury or illness.<br><br>Under the 2000 POEA-SEC, the terms “work-related injury” and “work-related illness” are, in turn, defined as follows:<br><br><blockquote><b>Definition of Terms:</b><br><br>For purposes of this contract, the following terms are defined as follows:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>11. Work-Related Injury –<b> injury(ies) resulting in</b> disability or <b>death arising out of and in the course of employment.</b><br><br>12. Work-Related Illness – <b>any sickness resulting to</b> disability or <b>death</b> as a result of an occupational disease listed under Section 32-A of this contract with the conditions set therein satisfied. (Emphases supplied)</blockquote><br>Case law explains that “[t]he words ‘arising out of’ refer to the origin or cause of the accident, and are descriptive of its character, while the words ‘in the course of’ refer to the time, place, and circumstances under which the accident takes place. As a matter of general proposition, an injury or accident is said to arise ‘in the course of employment’ when it takes place within the period of the employment, at a place where the employee reasonably may be, and while he is fulfilling his duties or is engaged in doing something incidental thereto.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>In this case, respondents submit that petitioner was unable to prove that Rodolfo’s illness, <i>i.e.</i>, Brainstem (pontine) Cavernous Malformation, which had supposedly supervened during the term of his employment on board the vessel MS Prinsendam, was not related to his work.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> To bolster the argument, respondents point to the fact that Brainstem (pontine) Cavernous Malformation is not listed as an occupational disease under Section 32-A<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> of the 2000 POEA-SEC.<br><br>The contention is untenable.<br><br>While it is true that Brainstem (pontine) Cavernous Malformation is not listed as an occupational disease under Section 32-A of the 2000 POEA-SEC, Section 20 (B) (4) of the same explicitly provides that “[t[he liabilities of the employer when the seafarer suffers work-related injury or illness <b><u>during the term of his contract</u></b> are as follows: <b><u>(t)hose illnesses not listed in Section 32 of this Contract are disputably presumed as work related.”</u></b> In other words, the 2000 POEA-SEC “has created a disputable presumption in favor of compensability[,] saying that those illnesses not listed in Section 32 are disputably presumed as work-related. This means that even if the illness is not listed under Section 32-A of the POEA-SEC as an occupational disease or illness, it will still be presumed as work-related, and it becomes incumbent on the employer to overcome the presumption.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> This presumption should be overturned only when the employer’s refutation is found to be supported by substantial evidence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> which, as traditionally defined is “such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as sufficient to support a conclusion.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> As held in the case of <i>Magsaysay Maritime Services v. Laurel</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Anent the issue as to who has the burden to prove entitlement to disability benefits, the petitioners argue that the burden is placed upon Laurel to prove his claim that his illness was work-related and compensable. Their posture does not persuade the Court.<br><br>True, hyperthyroidism is not listed as an occupational disease under Section 32-A of the 2000 POEA-SEC. Nonetheless, <b>Section 20 (B), paragraph (4) of the said POEA-SEC states that “those illnesses not listed in Section 32 of this Contract are disputably presumed as work-related.” The said provision explicitly establishes a presumption of compensability although disputable by substantial evidence</b>. The presumption operates in favor of Laurel as the burden rests upon the employer to overcome the statutory presumption. Hence, unless contrary evidence is presented by the seafarer’s employer/s, this disputable presumption stands. In the case at bench, other than the alleged declaration of the attending physician that Laurel’s illness was not work-related, the petitioners failed to discharge their burden. In fact, they even conceded that hyperthyroidism may be caused by environmental factor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></blockquote><br>Similarly in <i>Jebsens Maritime, Inc. v. Babol</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br><blockquote><i>The Principle of Work-relation</i><br><br>The 2000 POEA-SEC contract governs the claims for disability benefits by respondent as he was employed by the petitioners in September of 2006.<br><br>Pursuant to the said contract, the injury or illness must be work related and must have existed during the term of the seafarer’s employment in order for compensability to arise. Work-relation must, therefore, be established.<br><br>As a general rule, the principle of work-relation requires that the disease in question must be one of those listed as an occupational disease under Sec. 32-A of the POEA-SEC. <b>Nevertheless, should it be not classified as occupational in nature, Section 20 (B) paragraph 4 of the POEA-SEC provides that such diseases are disputed are disputably presumed as work-related.</b><br><br>In this case, it is undisputed that NPC afflicted respondent while on board the petitioners’ vessel. As a non-occupational disease, it has the disputable presumption of being work-related.<b> This presumption obviously works in the seafarer’s favor. Hence, unless contrary evidence is presented by the employers, the work-relatedness of the disease must be sustained</b>.</blockquote><br>And in <i>Fil-Star Maritime Corporation v. Rosete</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Although Central Retinal Vein Occlusion is not listed as one of the occupational diseases under Section 32-A of the 2000 Amended Terms of POEA-SEC, the resulting disability which is loss of sight of one eye, is specifically mentioned in Section 32 thereof (Schedule of Disability or Impediment for Injuries Suffered and Diseases Including Occupational Diseases or Illness Contracted). <b>More importantly, Section 20 (B), paragraph (4) states that “those illnesses not listed in Section 32 of this Contract are disputably presumed as work-related.”<br><br>The disputable presumption that a particular injury or illness that results in disability, or in some cases death, is work-related stands in the absence of contrary evidence.</b> In the case at bench, the said presumption was not overturned by the petitioners. Although, the employer is not the insurer of the health of his employees, he takes them as he finds them and assumes the risk of liability. Consequently, the Court concurs with the finding of the courts below that respondent’s disability is compensable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></blockquote><br>Records show that respondents’ sole evidence to disprove that Rodolfo’s illness is work-related was the medical opinion of Dr. Abaya, wherein it was explained that Rodolfo’s ailment is a congenital malformation of blood vessels in the brain that may be due to familial strains.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> However, as correctly observed by the LA, the document presented cannot be given probative value as it was a mere print out of an e-mail that was not signed or certified to by the doctor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Moreover, records reveal that Rodolfo was attended by Dr. Legaspi from the time he was admitted at the Medical City on February 20, 2008 up to his death on March 2, 2008<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> and not by Dr. Abaya whose qualifications to diagnose such kind of illness was not even established. Likewise, the medical opinion was not backed up by any medical findings to substantiate the claim that Rodolfo’s ailment was congenital in origin or that there were traces of the disease in Rodolfo’s family history. Under the foregoing premises, the unsubstantiated and unauthenticated medical findings of Dr. Abaya are therefore highly suspect and cannot be considered as substantial evidence to support respondents’ postulation. Thus, with no substantial evidence on the part of the employer and given that no other cogent reason exists to hold otherwise, the presumption under Section 20 (B) (4) should stand. Accordingly, the Court is constrained to pronounce that Rodolfo’s death, which appears to have been proximately caused by his Brainstem (pontine) Cavernous Malformation, was work-related, in satisfaction of the first requirement of compensability under Section 20 (A) (1) of the 2000 POEA-SEC.<br><br><div align="center"><b><u>II. The Seafarer’s Death Occurred During the Term of Employment.&nbsp; </u></b><br></div><br>Moving to the second requirement, respondents assert that Rodolfo’s death on March 2, 2008 had occurred beyond the term of his employment, considering his prior medical repatriation on February 20, 2008 which had the effect of contract termination. The argument is founded on Section 18 (B) (1) of the 2000 POEA-SEC, which reads:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 18. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT<br><br>x x x x<br><br>B. The employment of the seafarer is also terminated when the seafarer arrives at the point of hire for any of the following reasons:<br><ol><li>when the seafarer signs-off and is disembarked for medical reasons pursuant to Section 20(B)[5]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> of this Contract.</li></ol></blockquote><br>While it is true that a medical repatriation has the effect of terminating the seafarer’s contract of employment, it is, however, enough that the work-related illness, which eventually becomes the proximate cause of death, occurred while the contract was effective for recovery to be had. A further exposition is apropos.<br><br>Consistent with the State’s avowed policy to afford full protection to labor as enshrined in Article XIII of the 1987 Philippine Constitution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> the POEA-SEC was designed primarily for the protection and benefit of Filipino seafarers in the pursuit of their employment on board ocean-going vessels. As such, it is a standing principle that its provisions are to be construed and applied fairly, reasonably, and liberally in their favor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>Guided by this principle, the Court, in the recent case of <i>Canuel</i>, recognized that a medical repatriation case constitutes an exception to the second requirement under Section 20 (A) (1) of the 2000 POEA-SEC, <i>i.e.,</i> that the seafarer’s death had occurred during the term of his employment, in view of the terminative consequences of a medical repatriation under Section 18 (B) of the same. In essence, the Court held that under such circumstance, the work-related death need not precisely occur during the term of his employment as it is enough that the seafarer’s work-related injury or illness which eventually causes his death had occurred during the term of his employment. As rationalized in that case:<br><br><blockquote>With respect to the second requirement for death compensability, the Court takes this opportunity to clarify that while the general rule is that the seafarer’s death should occur during the term of his employment, the seafarer’s death occurring after the termination of his employment due to his medical repatriation on account of a work-related injury or illness constitutes an exception thereto. This is based on a liberal construction of the 2000 POEA-SEC as impelled by the plight of the bereaved heirs who stand to be deprived of a just and reasonable compensation for the seafarer’s death, notwithstanding its evident work-connection. The present petition is a case in point.<br><br>Here, Nancing’s repatriation occurred during the eighth (8th) month of his one (1) year employment contract. Were it not for his injury, which had been earlier established as work-related, he would not have been repatriated for medical reasons and his contract consequently terminated pursuant to Part 1 of Section 18 (B) of the 2000 POEA-SEC as hereunder quoted:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The terminative consequence of a medical repatriation case then appears to present a rather prejudicial quandary to the seafarer and his heirs. Particularly, if the Court were to apply the provisions of Section 20 of the 2000 POEA-SEC as above-cited based on a strict and literal construction thereof, then the heirs of Nancing would stand to be barred from receiving any compensation for the latter’s death despite its obvious work-relatedness. Again, this is for the reason that the work-related death would, by mere legal technicality, be considered to have occurred after the term of his employment on account of his medical repatriation. It equally bears stressing that neither would the heirs be able to receive any disability compensation since the seafarer’s death in this case precluded the determination of a disability grade, which, following Section 20 (B) in relation to Section 32 of the 2000 POEA-SEC, stands as the basis therefor.<br><br>However, a strict and literal construction of the 2000 POEA-SEC, especially when the same would result into inequitable consequences against labor, is not subscribed to in this jurisdiction. Concordant with the State’s avowed policy to give <b><u>maximum aid and full protection to labor</u></b> as enshrined in Article XIII of the 1987 Philippine Constitution, contracts of labor, such as the 2000 POEA-SEC, are deemed to be so impressed with public interest that the more beneficial conditions must be endeavoured in favor of the laborer. The rule therefore is one of liberal construction. As enunciated in the case of <i>Philippine Transmarine Carriers, Inc. v. NLRC</i> [(405 Phil. 487 [2001])]:<br><br><blockquote>The POEA Standard Employment Contract for Seamen is designed primarily for the protection and benefit of Filipino seamen in the pursuit of their employment on board ocean-going vessels. Its provisions must [therefore] be construed and applied fairly, reasonably and liberally in their favor [as it is only] then can its beneficent provisions be fully carried into effect. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Applying the rule on liberal construction, the Court is thus brought to the recognition that medical repatriation cases should be considered as an exception to Section 20 of the 2000 POEA-SEC. Accordingly, the phrase “<b>work-related death</b> of the seafarer, <b>during the term of his employment contract</b>” under Part A (1) of the said provision should not be strictly and literally construed to mean that the seafarer’s work-related death should have precisely occurred during the term of his employment. Rather, it is enough that <b>the seafarer’s <u>work-related injury or illness</u> which <u>eventually causes his death</u> should have occurred during the term of his employment.</b> Taking all things into account, the Court reckons that it is by this method of construction that undue prejudice to the laborer and his heirs may be obviated and the State policy on labor protection be championed. For if the laborer’s death was brought about (whether fully or partially) by the work he had harbored for his master’s profit, then it is but proper that his demise be compensated. Here, since it has been established that (<b><i><u>a</u></i></b>) the seafarer had been suffering from a work-related injury or illness during the term of his employment, (<u><i><b>b</b></i></u>) his injury or illness was the cause for his medical repatriation, and (<b><i><u>c</u></i></b>) it was later determined that the injury or illness for which he was medically repatriated was the proximate cause of his actual death although the same occurred after the term of his employment, the above-mentioned rule should squarely apply. Perforce, the present claim for death benefits should be granted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br>As elucidated in <i>Canuel</i>, the foregoing liberal approach was applied in <i>Inter-Orient Maritime, Incorporated v. Candava</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> <i>Interorient Maritime Enterprises, Inc. v. Remo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> and <i>Wallem Maritime Services, Inc. v. NLRC</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> wherein the Court had previously allowed the recovery of death benefits even if the seafarers in those cases had died after repatriation, given that there was proof of a clear causal connection between their work and the illness which was contracted in the course of employment, and their eventual death. The converse conclusion was reached in the cases of <i>Gau Sheng Phils., Inc. v. Joaquin</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> (<i>Gau Sheng</i>), <i>Spouses Aya-ay, Sr. v.

Osco Shipping Services, Inc.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> <i>Prudential Shipping and Management Corp. v. Sta. Rita</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> (<i>Prudential</i>), and <i>Ortega v. CA</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> (<i>Ortega</i>), since the element of work-relatedness had not been established. All in all, the sense gathered from these cases, as pointed out in <i>Canuel</i>, is that it is crucial to determine whether the death of the deceased was reasonably connected with his work, or whether the working conditions increased the risk of contracting the disease that resulted in the seafarer’s death. If the injury or illness is the proximate cause, or at least increased the risk of his death for which compensation is sought, recovery may be had for said death, or for that matter, for the injury or illness. Thus, in <i>Seagull Shipmanagement and Trans., Inc. v. NLRC,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> the Court significantly observed that:<br><br><blockquote>Even assuming that the ailment of the worker was contracted prior to his employment, this still would not deprive him of compensation benefits. <b><u>For what matters is that his work had contributed, even in a small degree, to the development of the disease and in bringing about his eventual death</u></b>. Neither is it necessary, in order to recover compensation, that the employee must have been in perfect health at the time he contracted the disease. A worker brings with him possible infirmities in the course of his employment, and while the employer is not the insurer of the health of the employees, he takes them as he finds them and assumes the risk of liability. <b><u>If the disease is the proximate cause of the employee’s death for which compensation is sought, the previous physical condition of the employee is unimportant, and recovery may be had for said death, independently of any pre-existing disease.</u></b> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> (Emphases and underscoring supplied; citations omitted)</blockquote><br>Employing the same spirit of liberality as fleshed out in <i>Canuel</i>, the Court finds that it would be highly inequitable and even repugnant to the State’s policy on labor to deny petitioner’s claim for death benefits for the mere technicality triggered by Rodolfo’s prior medical repatriation. As it has been clearly established that Rodolfo had been suffering from a work-related illness during the term of his employment that caused his medical repatriation and, ultimately, his death on March 2, 2008, it is but proper to consider the same as a compensable work-related death despite it having occurred after his repatriation. To echo <i>Canuel</i>, “it is enough that <b>the seafarer’s <u>work-related injury or illness</u> which <u>eventually causes his death</u> should have occurred during the term of his employment</b>. Taking all things into account, the Court reckons that it is by this method of construction that undue prejudice to the laborer and his heirs may be obviated and the State policy on labor protection be championed. For if the laborer’s death was brought about (whether fully or partially) by the work he had harbored for his master’s profit, then it is but proper that his demise be compensated.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>Lest it be misunderstood, the conclusion above-reached does not run counter to the Court’s ruling in <i>Klaveness Maritime Agency, Inc. v. Beneficiaries of the Late Second Officer Anthony s. Allas (Klaveness)</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> which the CA inaccurately relied on. As similarly pointed out in <i>Canuel</i>, the <i>Klaveness</i> case involved a seafarer who was not medically repatriated but was actually signed off from the vessel after the completion of his contract, his illness not proven to be work-related, and died almost two (2) years after the termination of his contract. Since the employment contract was terminated without any connection to a work-related cause, but rather because of its mere lapse, death benefits were denied to the seafarer’s heirs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> This is definitely not the case here since Rodolfo’s employment contract was terminated only because of his medical repatriation. Were it not for his illness, Rodolfo would not have been medically repatriated and his employment contract, in turn, terminated. Evidently, the termination of employment was forced upon by a work-related cause and it would be in contrast to the State’s policy on labor to deprive the seafarer’s heirs of death compensation despite its ascertained work-connection.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>This variance also exists as to the cases of <i>Gau Sheng</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> <i>Spouses Aya-ay, Sr.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> <i>Prudential,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> and <i>Ortega</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> which respondents invoke in their Comment dated February 16, 2012.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> As a common denominator, the element of work-relatedness was not established in those cases. Thus, being the primary factor considered in granting compensation, the Court denied the beneficiaries’ respective claims. Again, the Court has pored over the records and remains satisfied that Rodolfo’s death is work-related. Accordingly, this precludes the application of the above-stated rulings.<br><br><center><b><u>III. Amount of Death Benefits.</u></b></center><br><br>With the compensability of Rodolfo’s death now traversed, a corollary matter to determine is the amount of benefits due petitioner.<br><br>Records show that respondents do not deny – and therefore admit – the late Rodolfo’s membership in the AMOSUP that had entered into a collective bargaining agreement with HAL, or the ITWF-CBA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> Its provisions therefore must prevail over the standard terms and benefits formulated by the POEA in its Standard Employment Contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> Hence, the NLRC’s award of <b>US$60,000.00</b> as compensation for the death of Rodolfo in accordance with Article 21.2.1<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> of the ITWF-CBA was in order. The same holds true for the award of burial assistance in the amount of <b>US$1,000.00</b> which is provided under Section 20 (A) (4) (c)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> of the 2000 POEA-SEC. Moreover, conformably with existing case law, the NLRC’s grant of attorney’s fees in the amount of <b>US$6,100.00</b> was called for since petitioner was forced to litigate to protect her valid claim. Where an employee is forced to litigate and incur expenses to protect his right and interest, he is entitled to an award of attorney’s fees equivalent to 10% of the award.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br><br>All in all, the NLRC’s award of <b>US$67,100.00</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> – which, as the records bear, had already been paid<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> by respondents – is hereby sustained.<br><br><b><center><u>IV. A Final Point.</u><br></center></b><br>As a final point of rumination, it must be highlighted that the CA’s parameter of analysis in cases elevated to it from the NLRC is the existence of the latter’s grave abuse of discretion, considering that they come before the appellate court through petitions for <i>certiorari.</i> This delimitation, in relation to the Court’s task of reviewing the case eventually appealed before it, was explained in <i>Montoya v. Transmed Manila Corporation</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> as follows:<br><br><blockquote>[W]e review in this Rule 45 petition the decision of the CA on a Rule 65 petition filed by Montoya with that court. In a Rule 45 review, we consider the correctness of the assailed CA decision, in contrast with the review for jurisdictional error that we undertake under Rule 65. Furthermore, Rule 45 limits us to the review of questions of law raised against the assailed CA decision. In ruling for legal correctness, we have to view the CA decision in the same context that the petition for <i>certiorari</i> it ruled upon was presented to it; we have to examine the CA decision from the prism of whether it correctly determined the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion in the NLRC decision before it, not on the basis of whether the NLRC decision on the merits of the case was correct. In other words, we have to be keenly aware that the CA undertook a Rule 65 review, not a review on appeal, of the NLRC decision challenged before it. This is the approach that should be basic in a Rule 45 review of a CA ruling in a labor case. In question form, the question to ask is: Did the CA correctly determine whether the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in ruling on the case?<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup></blockquote><br>Given that the NLRC’s ruling was amply supported by the evidence on record and current jurisprudence on the subject matter, the Court, in opposition to the CA, finds that no grave abuse of discretion had been committed by the labor tribunal. Hence, the CA’s grant of respondents’ <i>certiorari </i>petition before it ought to be reversed, and consequently the NLRC Decision be reinstated.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
