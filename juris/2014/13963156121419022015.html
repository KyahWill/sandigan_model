Consequently, [respondent and] defendants, their agents, officers, representatives and all persons acting on their behalf, are restrained from further executing the Notice of Compliance and/or Writ of Possession.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Franco and Victoria, however, did not participate in the proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Regional Trial Court</i></b><br><br>On April 4, 2005, the RTC rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> in favor of petitioner.&nbsp; It ruled that petitioner was able to prove by preponderance of evidence that he did not participate in the execution of the mortgage contract giving rise to the presumption that his signature was forged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of [petitioner] Francisco Lim and against the [respondent] Equitable PCI Bank, Franco Lim and Victoria Yao Lim.<br><br>Accordingly, the Real Estate Mortgage Contract dated 14 June 1996 covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 57176; the Certificate of Sale dated 23 December 1997 covering the same title; TCT No. 9470 in the name of [respondent] Bank; and Tax Declaration No. 96-31807 issued in the name of the [respondent] Bank are hereby declared null and void and of no force and effect.<br><br>The writ of preliminary injunction which was issued by the Court as per Order dated 19 April 2001 is hereby made permanent.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></blockquote><br><i><b>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</b></i><br><br>On appeal, the CA reversed the RTC Decision.&nbsp; It ruled that petitioner’s mere allegation that his signature in the mortgage contract was forged is not sufficient to overcome the presumption of regularity of the notarized document.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, the CA disposed of the case in this wise:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant appeal is hereby GRANTED.&nbsp; The assailed Decision of the Regional Trial Court is SET ASIDE.&nbsp; The complaint filed by [petitioner] Francisco Lim against [respondent] Equitable PCI Banking Corporation is DISMISSED for lack of merit.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br></blockquote><br><div align="center"><b>Issues</b><br></div><br>Hence, this recourse by petitioner raising the following questions:<br><br><blockquote>Did the [CA] err when it held that no evidence was presented to support Petitioner’s claim that his signature was forged[?]<br><br>Corollary to the issue above, is the presentation of expert evidence indispensable in order that forgery may be sufficiently proven in this case[?]<br><br>Did the [CA] err when it set aside the Decision rendered by the Trial Court on 04 April 2005 and forthwith dismissed the complaint filed by Francisco Lim against Equitable PCI Banking Corporation for lack of merit[?]<br><br>Did Respondent Bank exercise the diligence required of it in the subject mortgage transaction; if it did not, did Respondent Bank’s failure violate the rights of Petitioner[?]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></blockquote><br>In a nutshell, the issues boil down to whether petitioner was able to prove that his signature was forged.<br><br><b><i>Petitioner’s Arguments</i></b><br><br>Petitioner contends that his signature in the mortgage contract was forged as he was not in the Philippines at the time of its execution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; He posits that the presentation of expert witnesses is not required to prove forgery as the court may make its own determination based on the evidence presented.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>&nbsp; He claims that respondent was negligent in approving the loan and in accepting the subject property as security for the loan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; He also blames respondent for not conducting a more in-depth inquiry before approving the loan since it was a “take-out” from a mortgage<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> constituted in favor of Planters Development Bank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; Lastly, he insists that respondent should have been alerted by the fact that the mortgage contract was executed without the consent of his wife.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br><i><b>Respondent’s Arguments</b></i><br><br>Respondent, on the other hand, echoes the ruling of the CA that petitioner’s mere denial is not enough to prove that his signature was forged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; Respondent points out that there was, in fact, no attempt on petitioner’s part to compare the alleged forged signature with any of his genuine signatures.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; Also, no evidence was presented to show that respondent did not exercise due diligence when it approved the loan and accepted the mortgage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>&nbsp; More important, petitioner cannot feign ignorance of the execution and existence of the mortgage because he even communicated with respondent to settle the loan and, when the property was foreclosed, to repurchase the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>&nbsp; Hence, petitioner is estopped from assailing the validity of the mortgage contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br><div align="center"><b>Our Ruling</b><br></div><br>The Petition is bereft of merit.<br><br><i><b>Petitioner failed to prove that his<br>signature was forged.</b></i><br><br>Allegations of forgery, like all other allegations, must be proved by clear, positive, and convincing evidence by the party alleging it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>&nbsp; It should not be presumed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> but must be established by comparing the alleged forged signature with the genuine signatures.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>&nbsp; Although handwriting experts are often offered as witnesses, they are not indispensable because judges must exercise independent judgment in determining the authenticity or genuineness of the signatures in question. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>In this case, the alleged forged signature was not compared with the genuine signatures of petitioner as no sample signatures were submitted.&nbsp; What petitioner submitted was another mortgage contract<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> executed in favor of Planters Development Bank, which he claims was also forged by his brother.&nbsp; But except for this, no other evidence was submitted by petitioner to prove his allegation of forgery.&nbsp; His allegation that he was in the US at the time of the execution of the mortgage contract is also not sufficient proof that his signature was forged.<br><br><b><i>Petitioner failed to prove negligence on<br>the part of respondent.</i></b><br><br>Likewise without merit is petitioner’s allegation of negligence on the part of respondent.<br><br>Before entering into a mortgage contract, banks are expected to exercise due diligence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>&nbsp; However, in this case, no evidence was presented to show that respondent did not exercise due diligence or that it was negligent in accepting the mortgage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>&nbsp; That petitioner was erroneously described as single and a Filipino citizen in the mortgage contract, when in fact he is married and an American citizen, cannot be attributed to respondent considering that the title of the mortgaged property was registered under “FRANCISCO LIM and FRANCO LIM, both Filipino citizens, of legal age, single.”<br><br><i><b>The nature of the property was never<br>raised as an issue.</b></i><br><br>The absence of his wife’s signature on the mortgage contract also has no bearing in this case.<br><br>We are not unaware that all property of the marriage is presumed to be conjugal, unless it is shown that it is owned exclusively by the husband or the wife;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> that this presumption is not overcome by the fact that the property is registered in the name of the husband or the wife alone;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> and that the consent of both spouses is required before a conjugal property may be mortgaged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> However, we find it iniquitous to apply the foregoing presumption especially since the nature of the mortgaged property was never raised as an issue before the RTC, the CA, and even before this Court. In fact, petitioner never alleged in his Complaint that the said property was conjugal in nature.&nbsp; Hence, respondent had no opportunity to rebut the said presumption.<br><br>Worth mentioning, in passing, is the ruling in <i>Philippine National Bank v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> to wit:<br><br><blockquote>The well-known rule in this jurisdiction is that a person dealing with a registered land has a right to rely upon the face of the torrens certificate of title and to dispense with the need of inquiring further, except when the party concerned has actual knowledge of facts and circumstances that would impel a reasonably cautious man to make such inquiry.<br><br>A torrens title concludes all controversy over ownership of the land covered by a final [decree] of registration.&nbsp; Once the title is registered the owner may rest assured without the necessity of stepping into the portals of the court or sitting in the <i>mirador de su casa </i>to avoid the possibility of losing his land.<br><br>Article 160 of the Civil Code provides as follows:<br><blockquote>“Art. 160. All property of the marriage is presumed to belong to the conjugal partnership, unless it be proved that it pertains exclusively to the husband or to the wife.”<br></blockquote>The presumption applies to property acquired during the lifetime of the husband and wife. In this case, it appears on the face of the title that the properties were acquired by Donata Montemayor when she was already a widow. <b>When the property is registered in the name of a spouse only and there is no showing as to when the property was acquired by said spouse, this is an indication that the property belongs exclusively to said spouse. And this presumption under Article 160 of the Civil Code cannot prevail when the title is in the name of only one spouse and the rights of innocent third parties are involved.</b><br><br>The PNB had a reason to rely on what appears on the certificates of title of the properties mortgaged. For all legal purposes, the PNB is a mortgagee in good faith for at the time the mortgages covering said properties were constituted the PNB was not aware to any flaw of the title of the mortgagor. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><b><i>Petitioner’s allegation of forgery is<br>belied by the evidence.</i></b><br><br>Moreover, petitioner’s subsequent actions belie his allegation of forgery.&nbsp; Before the expiration of the redemption period, petitioner sent respondent a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> signifying his intention to reacquire the said property.&nbsp; He even visited the bank to discuss the matter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>&nbsp; Clearly, his acts contradict his claim of forgery, which appears to be an afterthought and a last-ditch effort to recover the said property.<br><br>All told, we find no error on the part of the CA in upholding the validity of the mortgage contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is hereby <b>DENIED</b>.&nbsp; The July 30, 2008 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
