				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The employer has broader discretion in dismissing managerial employees on the ground of loss of trust and confidence than those occupying ordinary ranks.&nbsp; While plain accusations are not sufficient to justify the dismissal of rank and file employees, the mere existence of a basis for believing that managerial employees have breached the trust reposed on them by their employer would suffice to justify their dismissal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>Before us is a Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> assailing the September 12, 2006 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R.

(GASLI) is a domestic corporation engaged in transporting liquified petroleum gas (LPG) from Petron Corporation’s refinery in Limay, Bataan to Petron’s Plant in Ugong, Pasig and Petron’s Depot in Rosario, Cavite.&nbsp; Petitioners William How and Eduardo Francisco are its President and General Manager, respectively.&nbsp; Respondents, on the other hand, are crewmembers of one of GASLI’s vessels, M/T Dorothy Uno, with the following designations: Wilfredo Galvez (Galvez) as Captain; Joel Sales (Sales) as Chief Mate; Cristito Gruta (Gruta) as Chief Engineer; Danilo Arguelles (Arguelles) as Radio Operator; Renato Batayola (Batayola), Patricio Fresmillo (Fresmillo) and Jovy Noble (Noble) as Able Seamen; Emilio Dominico (Dominico) and Benny Nilmao (Nilmao) as Oilers; and Jose Austral (Austral) as 2<sup>nd</sup> Engineer.<br><br>Sometime in January 2000, one of the vessel’s Oilers, Richard Abis (Abis), reported to GASLI’s Office and Crewing Manager, Elsa Montegrico (Montegrico), an alleged illegal activity being committed by respondents aboard the vessel.&nbsp; Abis revealed that after about four to five voyages a week, a substantial volume of fuel oil is unconsumed and stored in the vessel’s fuel tanks.&nbsp; However, Gruta would misdeclare it as consumed fuel in the Engineer’s Voyage Reports.&nbsp; Then, the saved fuel oil is siphoned and sold to other vessels out at sea usually at nighttime.&nbsp; Respondents would then divide among themselves the proceeds of the sale.&nbsp; Abis added that he was hesitant at first to report respondents’ illegal activities for fear for his life.<br><br>An investigation on the alleged pilferage was conducted.&nbsp; After audit and examination of the Engineer’s Voyage Reports, GASLI’s Internal Auditor, Roger de la Rama (De la Rama), issued a Certification of Overstatement of Fuel Oil Consumption<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> for M/T Dorothy Uno stating that for the period June 30, 1999 to February 15, 2000 fuel oil consumption was overstated by 6,954.3 liters amounting to P74,737.86.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On February 11, 2000, a formal complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> for qualified theft was filed with the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) at Camp Crame against respondents, with Montegrico’s Complaint-Affidavit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> attached.&nbsp; On February 14, 2000, Abis submitted his <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> attesting to the facts surrounding respondents’ pilferage of fuel oil while on board the vessel, which he alleged started in August of 1999.&nbsp; On March 22, 2000, GASLI’s Port Captain, Genaro Bernabe (Bernabe), and De la Rama submitted a Complaint-Joint Affidavit,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> stating that in Gruta’s Engineer’s Voyage Reports, particularly for the period June 30, 1999 to February 15, 2000, he overstated the number of hours the vessel’s main and auxiliary engines, as well as its generators, were used resulting in the exaggerated fuel consumption.&nbsp; They also stated that according to independent surveyor Jade Sea-Land Inspection Services, the normal diesel fuel consumption of M/T Dorothy Uno for Petron Ugong–Bataan Refinery–Petron Ugong route averaged 1,021 liters only.&nbsp; Thus, comparing this with the declared amount of fuel consumed by the vessel when manned by the respondents, Bernabe and De la Rama concluded that the pilferage was considerable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; In her Supplementary Complaint Affidavit,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Montegrico implicated respondents except Sales, in the illegal activity.&nbsp; Bernabe, in his Reply-Affidavit,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> further detailed their analysis of the voyage reports <i>vis-a-vis</i> the report of Jade Sea-Land Inspection Services to strengthen the accusations.<br><br>In their Joint Counter-Affidavit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> and Joint Rejoinder-Affidavit,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> respondents denied the charge.&nbsp; They alleged that the complaint was based on conflicting and erroneous computation/estimates of fuel consumption; that the complaint was fabricated as borne out by its failure to specify the exact time the alleged pilferage took place; that the allegations that the pilferage has been going on since August 1999 and that Austral and Sales acted as lookouts are not true because both embarked on the vessel only on December 28, 1999 and January of 2000, respectively; that four other officers who were on board the vessel much longer than Austral and Sales were not included in the charge; and, that the complaint was intended as a mere leverage.<br><br>In a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> dated April 14, 2000, the CIDG referred the case to the Office of the City Prosecutor of Manila, which, after finding a <i>prima facie</i> case, filed the corresponding Information for Qualified Theft<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> dated August 18, 2000 with the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila.<br><br>Meanwhile, GASLI placed respondents under preventive suspension.&nbsp; After conducting administrative hearings, petitioners decided to terminate respondents from employment.&nbsp; Respondents (except Sales) were thus served with notices<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> informing them of their termination for serious misconduct, willful breach of trust, and commission of a crime or offense against their employer.<br><br>It appears that several other employees and crewmembers of GASLI’s two other vessels were likewise suspended and terminated from employment.&nbsp; Nine seafarers of M/T Deborah Uno were charged and terminated for insubordination, defying orders and refusal to take responsibility of cargo products/fuel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; For vessel M/T Coral Song, two crewmembers were dismissed for serious act of sabotage and grave insubordination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Proceedings before the Labor Arbiter<br><br>Respondents and the other dismissed crewmembers of M/T Deborah Uno and M/T Coral Song (complainants) filed with the NLRC separate complaints<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> for illegal suspension and dismissal, underpayment/non-payment of salaries/ wages, overtime pay, premium pay for holiday and rest day, holiday pay, service incentive leave pay, hazard pay, tax refunds and indemnities for damages and attorney’s fees against petitioners.&nbsp; The complaints, docketed as NLRC NCR Case Nos. 00-04-02026-00, 00-04-02062-00, 00-05-02620-00 and 00-07-03769-00, were consolidated.<br><br>On August 30, 2001, the Labor Arbiter rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> finding the dismissal of all 21 complainants illegal.&nbsp; As regards the dismissal of herein respondents, the Labor Arbiter ruled that the filing of a criminal case for qualified theft against them did not justify their termination from employment.&nbsp; The Labor Arbiter found it abstruse that the specific date and time the alleged pilferage took place were not specified and that some crewmembers who boarded the vessel during the same period the alleged pilferage transpired were not included in the charge.&nbsp; With regard to the other complainants, petitioners likewise failed to prove the legality of their dismissal. <br><br>The Labor Arbiter ordered petitioners to reinstate complainants with full backwages and to pay their money claims for unpaid salary, overtime pay, premium pay for holidays and rest days, holiday and service incentive leave pay, as indicated in the Computation of Money Claims.&nbsp; Complainants were likewise awarded damages due to the attending bad faith in effecting their termination, double indemnity prescribed by Republic Act (RA) No. 8188<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> in view of violation of the Minimum Wage Law, as well as 10% attorney’s fee.&nbsp; With respect to the claim for tax refund, the same was referred to the Bureau of Internal Revenue, while the claim for hazard pay was dismissed for lack of basis.&nbsp; The Labor Arbiter modified and recomputed the money claims of respondents, as follows:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2">1.

otherwise, their appeal would be dismissed.&nbsp; Petitioners failed to comply with the Order.&nbsp; Thus, on February 3, 2003, complainants moved for the dismissal of the appeal since petitioners had thus far posted only P1.5 million supersedeas bond and P500,000.00 cash bond, short of the amount required by the NLRC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> dated September 10, 2003, the NLRC, despite its earlier Order denying petitioners’ motion for the reduction of bond, reduced the amount of appeal bond to P1.5 million and gave due course to petitioners’ appeal.&nbsp; It also found the appeal meritorious and ruled that petitioners presented sufficient evidence to show just causes for terminating complainants’ employment and compliance with due process.&nbsp; Accordingly, complainants’ dismissal was valid, with the exception of Sales.&nbsp; The NLRC adjudged petitioners to have illegally dismissed Sales as there was absence of any record that the latter received any notice of suspension, administrative hearing, or termination.<br><br>The NLRC struck down the monetary awards given by the Labor Arbiter, which, it ruled, were based merely on the computations unilaterally prepared by the complainants.&nbsp; It also ruled that Galvez, a ship captain, is considered a managerial employee not entitled to premium pay for holiday and rest day, holiday pay and service incentive leave pay.&nbsp; As for the other complainants, the award for premium pay, holiday pay, rest day pay and overtime pay had no factual basis because no proof was adduced to show that work was performed on a given holiday or rest day or beyond the eight hours normal work time.&nbsp; Even then, the NLRC opined that these claims had already been given since complainants’ salaries were paid on a 365-day basis.&nbsp; Likewise, service incentive leave pay, awards for damages and double indemnity were deleted.&nbsp; Further, the NLRC sustained respondents’ contention that it is the Secretary of Labor or the Regional Director who has jurisdiction to impose the penalty of double indemnity for violations of the Minimum Wage Laws and not the Labor Arbiter.&nbsp; The NLRC disposed of the case as follows:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the assailed Decision is hereby reversed as to all complainants but modified with respect to Joel Sales.&nbsp;

The Motion for Partial Reconsideration filed by respondents is granted.&nbsp; The assailed decision is reconsidered in that Respondents are likewise adjudged not guilty of illegal dismissal with respect to complainant Joel Sales.

Respondents also assailed the NLRC’s ruling upholding the validity of their dismissal.&nbsp; They posited that the charge of pilferage is not supported by clear, convincing and concrete evidence.&nbsp; In fact, the RTC, Branch 15 of Manila already rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> on December 19, 2003 acquitting them of the crime of qualified theft lodged by the petitioners.&nbsp;

The CA, nonetheless, proceeded to discuss the merits of the case insofar as the illegal dismissal charge is concerned.&nbsp; The CA conformed with the Labor Arbiter’s ruling that petitioners’ evidence was inadequate to support the charge of pilferage and justify respondents’ termination.&nbsp;

Corp. v. Rollo</i>,<font color="#ff0000"><sup style="">[49]</sup></font> we ruled that the filing of a reduced appeal bond of P100,000.00 is not fatal in an appeal from the labor arbiter’s ruling awarding P3,132,335.57 to the dismissed employees. In <i>Rosewood Processing, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> we allowed the filing of a reduced bond of P50,000.00, accompanied with a motion, in an appeal from the Labor Arbiter’s award of P789,154.39.<br><br>In the case at bench, petitioners appealed from the Decision of the Labor Arbiter awarding to crewmembers the amount of P7,104,483.84 by filing a Notice of Appeal with a Very Urgent Motion to Reduce Bond and posting a cash bond in the amount of P500,000.00 and a supersedeas bond in the amount of P1.5 million.&nbsp; We find this to be in substantial compliance with Article 223 of the Labor Code.&nbsp; It is true that the NLRC initially denied the request for reduction of the appeal bond.&nbsp; However, it eventually allowed its reduction and entertained petitioners’ appeal.&nbsp; We disagree with the CA in holding that the NLRC acted with grave abuse of discretion as the granting of a motion to reduce appeal bond lies within the sound discretion of the NLRC upon showing of the reasonableness of the bond tendered and the merits of the grounds relied upon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>&nbsp; Hence, the NLRC did not err or commit grave abuse of discretion in taking cognizance of petitioners’ appeal before it.<br><br><i>Galvez and Gruta were validly dismissed<br>on the ground of loss of trust and<br>confidence; there were no valid grounds <br>for the dismissal of Arguelles, Batayola,<br>Fresnillo, Noble, Dominico, Nilmao and<br>Austral .</i><br><br>We do not, however, agree with the findings of the NLRC that all respondents were dismissed for just causes.&nbsp; In termination disputes, the burden of proving that the dismissal is for a just or valid cause rests on the employers.&nbsp; Failure on their part to discharge such burden will render the dismissal illegal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>As specified in the termination notice, respondents were dismissed on the grounds of (i) serious misconduct, particularly in engaging in pilferage while navigating at sea, (ii) willful breach of the trust reposed by the company, and (iii) commission of a crime or offense against their employer.&nbsp; Petitioners claim that based on the sworn statement of Abis, joint affidavit of Bernabe and De la Rama, letter of petitioner Francisco requesting assistance from the CIDG, formal complaint sheet, complaint and supplementary complaint affidavit of Montegrico, CIDG’s letter referring respondents’ case to the Office of the City Prosecutor of Manila, resolution of the City Prosecutor finding a <i>prima facie</i> case of qualified theft, and the Information for qualified theft, there is a reasonable ground to believe that respondents were responsible for the pilferage of diesel fuel oil at M/T Dorothy Uno, which renders them unworthy of the trust and confidence reposed on them.<br><br>After examination of the evidence presented, however, we find that petitioners failed to substantiate adequately the charges of pilferage against respondents.&nbsp; “[T]he quantum of proof which the employer must discharge is substantial evidence. x x x&nbsp; Substantial evidence is that amount of relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion, even if other minds, equally reasonable, might conceivably opine otherwise.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>&nbsp; Here, the mere filing of a formal charge, to our mind, does not automatically make the dismissal valid.&nbsp; Evidence submitted to support the charge should be evaluated to see if the degree of proof is met to justify respondents’ termination.&nbsp; The affidavit executed by Montegrico simply contained the accusations of Abis that respondents committed pilferage, which allegations remain uncorroborated.&nbsp; “Unsubstantiated suspicions, accusations, and conclusions of employers do not provide for legal justification for dismissing employees.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>&nbsp; The other bits of evidence were also inadequate to support the charge of pilferage.&nbsp; The findings made by GASLI’s port captain and internal auditor and the resulting certification executed by De la Rama merely showed an overstatement of fuel consumption as revealed in the Engineer’s Voyage Reports.&nbsp; The report of Jade Sea Land Inspection Services only declares the actual usage and amount of fuel consumed for a particular voyage.&nbsp; There are no other sufficient evidence to show that respondents participated in the commission of a serious misconduct or an offense against their employer.<br><br>As for the second ground for respondents’ termination, which is loss of trust and confidence, distinction should be made between managerial and rank and file employees.&nbsp; “[W]ith respect to rank-and-file personnel, loss of trust and confidence, as ground for valid dismissal, requires proof of involvement in the alleged events x x x [while for] managerial employees, the mere existence of a basis for believing that such employee has breached the trust of his employer would suffice for his dismissal.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>In the case before us, Galvez, as the ship captain, is considered a managerial employee since his duties involve the governance, care and management of the vessel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>&nbsp; Gruta, as chief engineer, is also a managerial employee for he is tasked to take complete charge of the technical operations of the vessel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>&nbsp; As captain and as chief engineer, Galvez and Gruta perform functions vested with authority to execute management policies and thereby hold positions of responsibility over the activities in the vessel.&nbsp; Indeed, their position requires the full trust and confidence of their employer for they are entrusted with the custody, handling and care of company property and exercise authority over it.<br><br>Thus, we find that there is some basis for the loss of confidence reposed on Galvez and Gruta.&nbsp; The certification issued by De la Rama stated that there is an overstatement of fuel consumption.&nbsp; Notably, while respondents made self-serving allegations that the computation made therein is erroneous, they never questioned the competence of De la Rama to make such certification.&nbsp; Neither did they question the authenticity and validity of the certification.&nbsp; Thus, the fact that there was an overstatement of fuel consumption and that there was loss of a considerable amount of diesel fuel oil remained unrefuted.&nbsp; Their failure to account for this loss of company property betrays the trust reposed and expected of them.&nbsp; They had violated petitioners’ trust and for which their dismissal is justified on the ground of breach of confidence.<br><br>As for Arguelles, Batayola, Fresnillo, Noble, Dominico, Nilmao and Austral, proof of involvement in the loss of the vessel’s fuel as well as their participation in the alleged theft is required for they are ordinary rank and file employees.&nbsp; And as discussed above, no substantial evidence exists in the records that would establish their participation in the offense charged.&nbsp; This renders their dismissal illegal, thus, entitling them to reinstatement plus full backwages, inclusive of allowances and other benefits, computed from the time of their dismissal up to the time of actual reinstatement.<br><br><i>No evidence of Sales’ dismissal from<br>employment.</i><br><br>The rule that the employer bears the burden of proof in illegal dismissal cases finds no application when the employer denies having dismissed the employee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup>&nbsp; The employee must first establish by substantial evidence the fact of dismissal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> before shifting to the employer the burden of proving the validity of such dismissal.<br><br>We give credence to petitioners’ claim that Sales was not dismissed from employment.&nbsp; Unlike the other respondents, we find no evidence in the records to show that Sales was preventively suspended, that he was summoned and subjected to any administrative hearing and that he was given termination notice.&nbsp; From the records, it appears Sales was not among those preventively suspended on February 26, 2000.&nbsp; To bolster this fact, petitioners presented the Payroll Journal Register for the period March 1-15, 2000<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> showing that Sales was still included in the payroll and was not among those who were charged with an offense to warrant suspension.&nbsp; In fact, Sales’ signature in the Semi-Monthly Attendance Report for February 26, 2000 to March 10, 2000<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> proves that he continued to work as Chief Mate for the vessel M/T Dorothy Uno along with a new set of crewmembers.&nbsp; It is likewise worth noting that in the Supplemental Complaint Affidavit of Montegrico, Sales was not included in the list of those employees who were accused of having knowledge of the alleged pilferage.&nbsp; This only shows that he was never subjected to any accusation or investigation as a prelude to termination.&nbsp; Hence, it would be pointless to determine the legality or illegality of his dismissal because, in the first place, he was not dismissed from employment.<br><br><i>Respondents are not entitled to their<br>money claims except 13th month pay for<br>the period of their illegal dismissal,<br>unpaid salaries, salary differentials,<br>double indemnity for violation of the<br>Minimum Wage Law and attorney’s fees.</i><br><br>As for the money claims of respondents, we note that petitioners did not bring this issue before us or assign it as error in this Petition.&nbsp; It was raised by the petitioners only in their Memorandum of Appeal filed with the NLRC and in their Motion for Reconsideration of the CA’s Decision reinstating the Labor Arbiter’s award.&nbsp; Nonetheless, in order to arrive at a complete adjudication of the case and avoid piecemeal dispensation of justice, we deem it necessary to resolve the validity of respondents’ money claims and to discuss the propriety of the Labor Arbiter’s award.<br><br>Galvez and Gruta, as managerial employees, are not entitled to their claims for holiday pay, service incentive leave pay and premium pay for holiday and restday.&nbsp; Article 82 of the Labor Code specifically excludes managerial employees from the coverage of the law regarding conditions of employment which include hours of work, weekly rest periods, holidays, service incentive leaves and service charges.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>As for Arguelles, Batayola, Fresnillo, Noble, Dominico, Nilmao and Austral, we cannot sustain the argument that they are classified as field personnel under Article 82 of the Labor Code who are likewise excluded.&nbsp; Article 82 defines field personnel as referring to “non-agricultural employees who regularly perform their duties away from the principal place of business or branch office of the employer and whose actual hours of work in the field cannot be determined with reasonable certainty.”&nbsp; They are those who perform functions which “cannot be effectively monitored by the employer or his representative.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup>&nbsp; Here, respondents, during the entire course of their voyage, remain on board the vessel.&nbsp; They are not field personnel inasmuch as they were constantly supervised and under the effective control of the petitioners through the vessel’s ship captain.<br><br>Nevertheless, we cannot grant them their claims for holiday pay, premium pay for holiday and restday, overtime pay and service incentive leave pay.&nbsp; Respondents do not dispute petitioners’ assertion that in computing respondents’ salaries, petitioners use 365 days as divisor.&nbsp; In fact, this was the same divisor respondents used in computing their money claims against petitioners.&nbsp; Hence, they are paid all the days of the month, which already include the benefits they claim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup>&nbsp; As for overtime pay and premium pay for holidays and restdays, no evidence was presented to prove that they rendered work in excess of the regular eight working hours a day or worked during holidays and restdays.&nbsp; In the absence of such proof, there could be no basis to award these benefits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>For the claim of service incentive leave pay, respondents did not specify what year they were not paid such benefit.&nbsp; In addition, records show that they were paid their vacation leave benefits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, in accordance with Article 95 of the Labor Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> respondents can no longer claim service incentive leave pay.<br><br>On the other hand, for failure to effectively refute the awards for 13th month pay for the period that respondents were illegally dismissed, unpaid salaries and salary differentials,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> we affirm the grant thereof as computed by the Labor Arbiter.&nbsp; Petitioners’ evidence which consist of a mere tabulation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> of the amount of actual benefits paid and given to respondents is self-serving as it does not bear the signatures of the employees to prove that they had actually received the amounts stated therein.<br><br>Next, we come to the legitimacy of the Labor Arbiter’s authority to impose the penalty of double indemnity for violations of the Minimum Wage Law.&nbsp; Petitioners argue that the authority to issue compliance orders in relation to underpayment of wages is vested exclusively on the Secretary of Labor or the Regional Director and that the Labor Arbiter has no jurisdiction thereover.&nbsp; They cite Section 12 of RA 6727,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> as amended by RA 8188, which provides:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 12. Any person, corporation, trust, firm, partnership, association or entity which refuses or fails to pay any of the prescribed increases or adjustments in the wage rates made in accordance with this Act shall be punished by a fine [of] not less than Twenty-five thousand pesos (P25,000) nor more than One hundred thousand pesos (P100,000) or imprisonment of not less than two (2) years nor more than four (4) years or both such fine and imprisonment at the discretion of the court: Provided, That any person convicted under this Act shall not be entitled to the benefits provided for under the Probation Law.<br><br>The employer concerned shall be ordered to pay an amount equivalent to double the unpaid benefits owing to the employees: Provided, That payment of indemnity shall not absolve the employer from the criminal liability under this Act.<br><br>If the violation is committed by a corporation, trust or firm, partnership, association or any other entity, the penalty of imprisonment shall be imposed upon the entity’s responsible officers including but not limited to, the president, vice president, chief executive officer, general manager, managing director or partner.</blockquote><br>Petitioners’ contention is untenable.&nbsp; First, there is no provision in RA 6727 or RA 8188 which precludes the Labor Arbiter from imposing the penalty of double indemnity against employers.&nbsp; Second, Article 217 of the Labor Code gives the Labor Arbiter jurisdiction over cases of termination disputes and those cases accompanied with a claim for reinstatement.&nbsp; Thus, in <i>Bay Haven, Inc. v.
