No. 564 and later amended by P.D. No. 1400.&nbsp; PTA used to operate the Philippine Gorge Tourist Zone (PGTZ) Administration Complex (PTA Complex), a declared tourist zone in Pagsanjan, Laguna.<br><br>Respondent Pagsanjan Tourism Consumers’ Cooperative (PTCC) is a cooperative organized since 1988 under Republic Act No. 6938, or the “Cooperative Code of the Philippines.”&nbsp; The other individual respondents are PTCC employees, consisting of restaurant staff and boatmen at the PTA Complex.<br><br>In 1989, in order to help the PTCC as a cooperative, the PTA allowed it to operate a restaurant business located at the main building of the PTA Complex and the boat ride services to ferry guests and tourists to and from the Pagsanjan Falls, paying a certain percentage of its earnings to the PTA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>In 1993, the PTA implemented a reorganization and reshuffling in its top level management.&nbsp; Herein petitioner Rodolfo Laborte (Laborte) was&nbsp; designated as Area Manager, CALABARZON area with direct supervision over the PTA Complex and other entities at the Southern Luzon.<br><br>On October 22, 1993, Laborte served a written notice upon the respondents to cease the operations of the latter’s restaurant business and boat ride services in view of the rehabilitation, facelifting and upgrading project of the PTA Complex.&nbsp; Consequently, on November 9, 1993, the PTCC filed with the RTC, Branch 28, Santa Cruz, Laguna a Complaint for Prohibition, Injunction and Damages with Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and Preliminary Injunction<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> against Laborte, docketed as Civil Case No. 3150.&nbsp; The PTCC also sought from the court the award of moral and exemplary damages, attorney’s fees and costs of suit.&nbsp; It also prayed for the issuance of a TRO or writ of preliminary injunction to prohibit Laborte from causing the PTCC to cease the operations of the restaurant and boat ride services and from evicting the PTCC’s restaurant from the main building of the PTA Complex.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>In an Order dated November 11, 1993, the trial court issued the TRO prayed for, prohibiting Laborte from (a) causing the PTCC to cease operations; (b) doing the threatened act of closing the operation of the&nbsp; PTCC’s restaurant and other activities; (c) evicting the PTCC’s restaurant from the main building of the PTA Complex; and (d) demolishing the said building.&nbsp; In the same Order, the trial court set the hearing on the Writ of Preliminary Injunction on November 25, 1993.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Opposing the issuance of the TRO, Laborte averred that the PTCC does not own the restaurant facility as it was only tolerated to operate the same by the PTA as a matter of lending support and assistance to the cooperative in its formative years.&nbsp; It has neither been granted any franchise nor concession to operate the restaurant nor any exclusive franchise to handle the boating operations in the complex.&nbsp; Since the PTCC had no contract, concession, or exclusive franchise to operate the restaurant business and the boating services in the PTA Complex, no existing right has been allegedly violated by the petitioners.&nbsp; The respondents, therefore, had no right for the injunctive relief prayed for.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On December 7, 1993, the PTCC filed with the trial court a Petition for Contempt with Motion for Early Resolution.&nbsp; It alleged that Laborte and his lawyers defied the TRO and proceeded to close the restaurant on December 2, 1993.&nbsp; The PTCC also alleged that Laborte prohibited its own boatmen from ferrying tourists and allowed another association of boatmen to operate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On December 13, 1993, Laborte filed his Answer with Counter-Claim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; He denied the PTCC’s allegations of harassment, threat and retaliation.&nbsp; He claimed (a) that his actions were upon the mandate of his superiors and the PTA’s rehabilitation programs in the area;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> (b) that the PTA only tolerated the PTCC’s operations;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> and (c) that the issuance of a permanent injunction will violate the PTA’s constitutional freedom to operate a legitimate business enterprise and the legal requirement of a public bidding for the operation of revenue-generating projects of government entities involving private third parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>On March 14, 1994, the individual respondents, Fabricio et al., who are employees and boatmen of the PTCC, filed a Complaint-in-Intervention against Laborte.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; They stated that they were rendered jobless and were deprived of their livelihood because Laborte failed to heed the trial court’s TRO.&nbsp; Thus, they prayed that the trial court order Laborte to pay their unearned salaries, among others.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; Laborte opposed but the trial court in an Order dated March 25, 1994 admitted the Complaint-in-Intervention, finding the same to be well-founded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On April 4, 1994, the PTCC filed an Amended Complaint to include petitioner PTA as defendant and the additional prayer for payment of Thirty Thousand Pesos (P30,000.00) a month, representing the PTCC’s unrealized profits from November 1993 up to the actual resumption of its restaurant and boat ride businesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; In return, the PTA filed its Answer with Counterclaim,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> alleging, among others, that (1) the PTCC has no cause of action against it since the PTA owned the restaurant and the boat ride facilities within the Complex and that it never formally entered into a contract with the PTCC to operate the same; (2) the PTA did not violate the trial court’s TRO and Writ of Preliminary Injunction since the PTA was not yet impleaded as defendant at that time; (3) the physical rehabilitation of the PTA Complex, including the restaurant and boat facilities therein, was part of its new marketing strategy; and (4) the action had become moot and academic in view of the actual closure of the PTCC’s restaurant and boat service businesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>On May 29, 2002, the RTC rendered a decision finding for the respondents, the dispositive portion of which provides:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, IN THE LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS, Judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiff and intervenors and against the defendants by ordering the defendants jointly and severally to pay the plaintiff and intervenors the following sums:<br><br><blockquote>FOR THE PLAINTIFF<br><br>1.

The purpose for which the evidence is offered must be specified.<br></blockquote><br>From the above provision, it is clear that the court considers the evidence only when it is formally offered.&nbsp; The offer of evidence is necessary because it is the duty of the trial court to base its findings of fact and its judgment only and strictly on the evidence offered by the parties.&nbsp; A piece of document will remain a scrap of paper without probative value unless and until admitted by the court in evidence for the purpose or purposes for which it is offered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; The formal offer of evidence allows the parties the chance to object to the presentation of an evidence which may not be admissible for the purpose it is being offered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>However, there are instances when the Court relaxed the foregoing rule and allowed evidence not formally offered to be admitted.&nbsp; Citing <i>People v.

Thus, since it is only exercising its mandate and has acted in good faith, petitioner PTA believes that it has not incurred any liability against respondents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Citing <i>Mendoza v.
