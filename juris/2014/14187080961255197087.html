Chua that the findings of the physical examination were consistent with recent sexual intercourse, provide additional corroboration to the testimonies of AAA and BBB.&nbsp; It should be noted that this report was stipulated upon by the prosecution and the defense.<br><br>We have pronounced time and again that both denial and alibi are inherently weak defenses which cannot prevail over the positive and credible testimony of the prosecution witness that the accused committed the crime. Thus, as between a categorical testimony which has a ring of truth on one hand, and a mere denial and alibi on the other, the former is generally held to prevail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; For the defense of alibi to prosper, it must be sufficiently convincing as to preclude any doubt on the physical impossibility of the presence of the accused at the <i>locus criminis</i> or its immediate vicinity at the time of the incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; In the case at bar, accused-appellant and his brother, second defense witness Jose, claim that the former was taking care of his daughter in his house at around 7:00 p.m. of September 7, 2003.&nbsp; He then went out and proceeded to a <i>videoke</i> bar, which was merely 20 meters away from his house.&nbsp; Accused-appellant and his brother admitted that their house was merely 50 meters away, or around a one-minute walk, from the house of AAA, where the alleged incident occurred.&nbsp; Accused-appellant was therefore clearly in the immediate vicinity of the <i>locus criminis</i> at the time of the commission of the crime, and thus accused-appellant’s defense of alibi must fail.<br><br>Other than alibi and denial, accused-appellant presented the testimony of Alicia, a neighbor of AAA and accused-appellant, to prove that another person raped AAA.&nbsp; However, the record is clear that AAA positively identified accused-appellant as the culprit both at the <i>barangay</i> outpost minutes after the incident, and in open court.&nbsp; It is furthermore axiomatic that when it comes to evaluating the credibility of the testimonies of the witnesses, great respect is accorded to the findings of the trial judge who is in a better position to observe the demeanor, facial expression, and manner of testifying of witnesses, and to decide who among them is telling the truth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; The trial court, which was able to carefully observe the testimony of Alicia, was not adequately convinced by her allegations.<br><br>To recall, the Information charged accused-appellant of committing the following act: “by means of force and intimidation, did, then and there willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously have carnal knowledge [of AAA], 19 years of age but with a mental age of a 5 year old, hence, a retardate, or demented, which is known to accused at the time of the commission of the offense, against her will and consent and to her damage and prejudice.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; The Information, as worded, can conceivably comprehend rape under either paragraph 1(b) or 1(d) of Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code, which provides:<br><br><blockquote>Article 266-A. <i>Rape; When and How Committed. </i>— <b>Rape is committed</b> —<br><br>1) By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:<br><br>a) Through force, threat or intimidation;<br><br>b) <b>When the offended party is deprived of reason</b> or is otherwise unconscious;<br><br>c) By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority;<br><br>d) <b>When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present.</b> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>In <i>People v. Caoile,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> we differentiated the terms “deprived of reason” and “demented,” as follows:<br><br><blockquote>The term <i>demented</i> refers to a person who has dementia, which is a condition of deteriorated mentality, characterized by marked decline from the individual's former intellectual level and often by emotional apathy, madness, or insanity.&nbsp; On the other hand, the phrase deprived of reason under paragraph 1 (b) has been interpreted to include those suffering from mental abnormality, deficiency, or retardation.&nbsp; Thus, AAA, who was clinically diagnosed to be a mental retardate, can be properly classified as a person who is “deprived of reason,” and not one who is “demented.”</blockquote><br>In the case at bar, AAA was clinically diagnosed to have mental retardation with the mental capacity of a seven-year old child.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>&nbsp; The prosecution and the defense agreed to stipulate on the conclusion of the psychologist that the “mental age of the victim whose chronological age at the time of the commission of the offense is nineteen (19)&nbsp; years old x x x is that of a seven (7) year old child.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; Accused-appellant is therefore criminally liable for rape under paragraph 1(b) of Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code.&nbsp; The appropriate penalty is provided for by Article 266-B, which relevantly provides:<br><br><blockquote>The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following aggravating/qualifying circumstances:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>10. When the offender knew of the mental disability, emotional disorder and/or physical handicap of the offended party at the time of the commission of the crime.</blockquote><br>Since the accused-appellant’s knowledge of AAA’s mental retardation was alleged in the Information and admitted by the former during the trial, the above special qualifying circumstance is applicable, and the penalty of death should have been imposed.&nbsp; With the passage, however, of Republic Act No. 9346<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> prohibiting the imposition of the death penalty, the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> shall instead be imposed.<br><br>The RTC sentenced accused-appellant to suffer the penalty of imprisonment of twenty years and one day to forty years of <i>reclusion perpetua. </i> The Court of Appeals correctly modified the penalty to be simply <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.&nbsp; Since <i>reclusion perpetua </i>is an indivisible penalty, the Indeterminate Sentence Law cannot be applied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>As regards accused-appellant’s civil liability, the RTC ordered him to pay AAA in the amount of P75,000.00 as moral damages and P75,000.00 as exemplary damages.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals modified the trial court’s decision by granting the additional award of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity and reducing the award of exemplary damages to P30,000.00.&nbsp; In accordance, however, to <i>People v. Lumaho</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> where the penalty for the crime committed is death which cannot be imposed because of Republic Act No. 9346, we increase the amounts of indemnity and damages to be imposed as follows: P100,000.00 as civil indemnity; P100,000.00 as moral damages; and P100,000.00 as exemplary damages.&nbsp; In addition, we impose 6% interest per annum from finality of judgment until fully paid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the present appeal is <b>DENIED</b>.&nbsp; The Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
