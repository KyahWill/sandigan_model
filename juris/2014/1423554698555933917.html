				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">To terminate the employment of workers simply because they asserted their legal rights by filing a complaint is illegal.&nbsp; It violates their right to security of tenure and should not be tolerated.<br><br>In this petition for review<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> on certiorari filed by Elena Briones,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> we are asked to reverse the decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 101145.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals found grave abuse of discretion on the part of the National Labor Relations Commission, and reinstated the decision of the Labor Arbiter dated August 2, 2006 finding that respondents Victor Gallano and Enriquito Siarez were illegally dismissed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Stanley Fine Furniture (Stanley Fine), through its owners Elena and Carlos Wang, hired respondents Victor T. Gallano and Enriquito Siarez in 1995 as painters/carpenters.&nbsp; Victor and Enriquito each received P215.00 basic salary per day.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>On May 26, 2005, Victor and Enriquito filed a labor complaint<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> for underpayment/non-payment of salaries, wages, Emergency Cost of Living Allowance (ECOLA), and 13<sup>th</sup> month pay.&nbsp; They indicated in the complaint form that they were “still working”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> for Stanley Fine.<br><br>Victor and Enriquito filed an amended complaint<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> on May 31, 2005, for actual illegal dismissal, underpayment/non-payment of overtime pay, holiday pay, premium for holiday pay, service incentive leave pay, 13th month pay, ECOLA, and Social Security System (SSS) benefit.&nbsp; In the amended complaint, Victor and Enriquito claimed that they were dismissed on May 26, 2005.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Victor and Enriquito were allegedly scolded for filing a complaint for money claims. Later on, they were not allowed to work.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, petitioner Elena Briones claimed that Victor and Enriquito were “required to explain their absences for the month of May 2005, but they refused.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>In the decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> dated August 2, 2006, the Labor Arbiter found that Victor and Enriquito were illegally dismissed.&nbsp; The Labor Arbiter noted the following contradictory statements in Stanley Fine’s position paper, thus:<br><br><blockquote>Also, Stanley Fine was forced to declare them dismissed due to their failure to report back to work for a considerable length of time and also, due to the filing of an unmeritorious labor case against it by the two complainants. . . .<br><br>. . . .<br><br>The main claim of the complainants is their allegation that they were dismissed. They were <u>NOT DISMISSED</u>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote><br>The Labor Arbiter resolved these contradictory statements in the following manner:<br><br><blockquote>In fact, the admission that complainants were dismissed due to the filing of a case against them by complainants is a blatant transgression of the Labor Code that no retaliatory measure shall be levelled against an employee by reason of an action commenced against an employer. This is virtually a confession of judgment and a death [k]nell to the cause of respondents. It actually lends credence to the fact that complainants were dismissed upon respondents’ knowledge of the complaint before the NLRC as attested by the fact that four days after the filing of the complaint, the same was amended to include illegal dismissal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></blockquote><br>The Labor Arbiter also awarded moral and exemplary damages to respondents, reasoning that:<br><br><blockquote>Finding malice, and ill-will in the dismissal of complainants, which exhibits arrogance and defiance of labor laws on the part of respondents, moral and exemplary damages for P50,000 and P30,000 respectively for each of the complainants are hereby granted.<br><br>WHEREFORE, premises considered, respondents are hereby declared guilty of illegal dismissal. As a consequence, they are ORDERED to reinstate complainant to their former position and pay jointly and severally complainants’ full backwages from date of dismissal until actual reinstatement[.]<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></blockquote><br>On appeal, the National Labor Relations Commission reversed<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> the Labor Arbiter’s decision, ruling that the Labor Arbiter erred in considering the statement, “due to the filing of an unmeritorious labor case,” as an admission against interest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; The National Labor Relations Commission held that:<br><br><blockquote>Contrary to the findings of the Labor Arbiter below . . . respondents-appellants’ allegations in paragraph 5 of their position paper is not an admission that they dismissed complainants-appellees moreso [sic], in retaliation for complainants-appellees’ filing a complaint against them. Had the Labor Arbiter been more circumspect analyzing the facts brought before him by the herein parties pleadings, he could have easily discerned that complainants-appellees were merely required to explain their unauthorized absences they committed for the month of May 2005 alone. Complainants-appellees did not deny knowledge of the memoranda issued to them on May 23, 25 and 27, 2005 for complainant-appellee Siarez and June 1, 2005 memo for Gallano. That they simply refused receipt of them cannot extricate themselves from its legal effects as the last of which clearly show that it was sent to them thru the mails.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>The same holds true with the findings of the Labor Arbiter below that respondents-appellants’ evidence, Annexes “7” to “74” “cannot be admissible in evidence” for being mere xerox copies and “are easily subjected to interpolation and tampering.”<br><br>Suffice it to state that these pieces of evidence were adduced during the arbitral proceedings below, where complainants-appellees were afforded the opportunity to controvert and deny its truthfulness and veracity that complainants-appellees never objected thereto or deny its authenticity, certainly did not render said documents tampered or interpolated.<br><br>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the decision appealed from is hereby <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b>. Respondents-appellants are however ordered to reinstate complainants-appellees to their former position without loss of seniority rights and benefits appurtenant thereto, without backwages.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Victor and Enriquito filed a motion for reconsideration,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> which the National Labor Relations Commission denied in the resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> dated August 15, 2007.<br><br>Thus, Victor and Enriquito filed a petition for certiorari before the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; Generally, petitions for certiorari are limited to the determination and correction of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.&nbsp; However, the Court of Appeals reviewed the findings of facts and of law of the labor tribunals, considering that the Labor Arbiter and the National Labor Relations Commission had different findings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals found that Stanley Fine failed to show any valid cause for Victor and Enriquito’s termination and to comply with the two-notice rule.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; Also, the Court of Appeals noted that Stanley Fine’s statements — that it was “<i>forced to declare them dismissed”</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> due to their absences and <i>“due to the filing of an unmeritorious labor case against it by the two complainants</i>”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> — were admissions against interest and binding upon Stanley Fine.&nbsp; Thus:<br><br><blockquote>An admission against interest is the best evidence which affords the greatest certainty of the facts in dispute since no man would declare anything against himself unless such declaration is true. Thus, an admission against interest binds the person who makes the same, and absent any showing that this was made thru palpable mistake, no amount of rationalization can offset it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></blockquote><br>The Court of Appeals also held that the immediate amendment of Victor and Enriquito’s complaint negated their alleged abandonment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>With regard to the National Labor Relations Commission’s deletion of the monetary award, the Court of Appeals ruled that:<br><br><blockquote>Notably, private respondents’ claim of payment is again belied by their own admission in their position paper that they failed to pay petitioners their ECOLA and to ask for exemption from payment of said benefits to their employees. In any event, private respondents’ allegation of payment of money claims is not supported by substantial evidence. The Labor Arbiter found that the documents presented by private respondents were mere photocopies, with no appropriate signatures of petitioners and could be easily subjected to interpolation and tampering.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></blockquote><br>The Court of Appeals, thus, granted the petition, set aside the resolutions of the National Labor Relations Commission, and reinstated the decision of the Labor Arbiter.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; The dispositive portion of its decision reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the assailed Resolutions dated June 18, 2007 and August 15, 2007 of public respondent NLRC are set aside and the Labor Arbiter’s Decision dated August 2, 2006 is reinstated.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></blockquote><br>Stanley Fine filed a motion for reconsideration,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> which the Court of Appeals denied in the resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> dated November 27, 2009.<br><br>On December 21, 2009, Stanley Fine, Elena, and Carlos Wang filed a motion for extension of time to file petition for review on certiorari.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>On January 21, 2010, Elena Briones filed a petition for review.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; Elena alleged that she is the “registered owner/proprietress of the business operation doing business under the name and style ‘Stanley Fine Furniture.’”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>&nbsp; She argued that the Court of Appeals erred in ruling that Victor and Enriquito were illegally dismissed considering that she issued several memoranda to them, but they refused to accept the memoranda and explain their absences.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; As to the statement, “due to the filing of an unmeritorious labor case,”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> it was error on the part of her former counsel which should not bind her.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; Further, the monetary claims should not have been awarded because these were based on the allegations in the complaint form,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> whereas Elena presented documentary evidence to show that Victor and Enriquito’s money claims had been paid.&nbsp; They never rebutted her documentary evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; As to the award of moral and exemplary damages and attorney’s fees, Victor and Enriquito did not present any evidence to support their claim, thus, it was error for the Court of Appeals to have reinstated the Labor Arbiter’s decision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>In compliance with this court’s resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> dated February 17, 2010, Victor and Enriquito filed their comment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> and argued that the petition should be denied because Elena “is neither the respondent, party in interest or representatives as parties.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>&nbsp; With regard to Victor’s two absences and Enriquito’s five absences, these should not be interpreted as refusal to go back to work tantamount to abandonment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>&nbsp; Considering that Elena’s arguments had been passed upon by the labor tribunals and the Court of Appeals, this petition should be denied.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Elena filed her reply<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> and posited that she has legal standing to file the petition for review because she is the owner/proprietress of Stanley Fine.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; In addition, she argued that Victor and Enriquito knew that she, Elena, is the real party-in-interest because during the pendency of the labor case, she filed an ex-parte manifestation, attaching her Department of Trade and Industry certificate of registration of business name,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> showing that the registration is under her maiden name, Elena Y. Briones.&nbsp; As per the Department of Trade and Industry’s certification,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Stanley Fine is a sole proprietorship owned by “Elena Briones Yam-Wang.”<br><br>Thus, this court is asked to resolve procedural and substantive issues in this petition as follows:<br><br><ol><li>Whether Elena Briones has standing to file this petition for review on certiorari;<br><br></li><li>Whether the Court of Appeals erred in ruling that Victor Gallano and Enriquito Siarez were illegally dismissed;<br><br></li><li>Whether the Court of Appeals erred when it agreed with the Labor Arbiter that the statement, “filing of an unmeritorious labor case,” is an admission against interest and binding against Stanley Fine Furniture; and<br><br></li><li>Whether the Court of Appeals erred in awarding the monetary claims and damages to Victor Gallano and Enriquito Siarez, considering that they did not produce evidence to support their claims.<br></li></ol><br><b><center>I.</center><br>Petitioner Elena Briones has<br> standing to file this case</b><br><br>On this issue, petitioners claimed that Elena Briones is not the real party-in-interest; hence, the decision of the Court of Appeals is final and executory since the petition for review was not properly filed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>In her reply, Elena argued that she is the sole proprietor of Stanley Fine, a fact known to respondents.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>&nbsp; As the sole proprietor, she has standing to file this petition.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Respondents cannot deny Elena Briones’ standing to file this petition considering that in their amended complaint filed before the Labor Arbiter, they wrote “Stanley Fine Furniture, <i>Elina</i> [sic] <i>Briones Wang as owner </i>and Carlos Wang” as their employers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Also, respondents did not refute Elena’s allegation that Stanley Fine is a sole proprietorship.&nbsp; In <i>Excellent Quality Apparel, Inc. v. Win Multi-Rich Builders, Inc.,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> this court stated that:<br><br><blockquote>A <i>sole proprietorship does not possess a juridical personality separate and distinct from the personality of the owner of the enterprise.</i> The law merely recognizes the existence of a sole proprietorship as a form of business organization conducted for profit by a single individual and requires its proprietor or owner to secure licenses and permits, register its business name, and pay taxes to the national government. <i>The law does not vest a separate legal personality on the sole proprietorship or empower it to file or defend an action in court</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Thus, Stanley Fine, being a sole proprietorship, does not have a personality separate and distinct from its owner, Elena Briones. Elena, being the proprietress of Stanley Fine, can be considered as a real party-in-interest and has standing to file this petition for review.<br><br><b><center>II.</center><br>Review of procedural parameters</b><br><br>In her petition for review, Elena raised the following issues: (a) whether “the filing of an Establishment Termination Report”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> is an act of dismissal; (b) whether counsel’s allegation that an employee was dismissed due to the filing of an “unmeritorious” case against the employer is binding;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> (c) whether a Labor Arbiter can award monetary claims based on the allegations in the complaint form;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> and (d) whether the award of moral and exemplary damages and attorney’s fees is proper even without supporting evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>In a Rule 45 petition for review of a Court of Appeals decision rendered under Rule 65, this court is guided by the following rules:<br><br><blockquote>[I]n a Rule 45 review (of the CA decision rendered under Rule 65), the question of law that confronts the Court is the legal correctness of the CA decision – i.e., whether the CA correctly determined the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion in the NLRC decision before it, and not on the basis of whether the NLRC decision on the merits of the case was correct. . . .<br><br>Specifically, in reviewing a CA labor ruling under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, the Court’s review is limited to:<br><br>(1) Ascertaining the correctness of the CA’s decision in finding the presence or absence of a grave abuse of discretion. This is done by examining, on the basis of the parties’ presentations, whether the CA correctly determined that at the NLRC level, all the adduced pieces of evidence were considered; no evidence which should not have been considered was considered; and the evidence presented supports the NLRC findings; and<br><br>(2) Deciding any other jurisdictional error that attended the CA’s interpretation or application of the law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> (Citation omitted)</blockquote><br>Thus, the proper issue in this case is whether the Court of Appeals correctly determined the presence of grave abuse of discretion on the part of the National Labor Relations Commission.<br><br><b><center>III.</center><br>There was no just cause in the <br>dismissal of respondents</b><br><br>The Court of Appeals found grave abuse of discretion on the part of the National Labor Relations Commission when it reversed the Labor Arbiter’s decision.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals held that respondents were illegally dismissed because no valid cause for dismissal was shown.&nbsp; Also, there was no compliance with the two-notice requirement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>Elena admitted that no notices of dismissal were issued to respondents.&nbsp; However, memoranda were given to respondents, requiring them to explain their absences.&nbsp; She claimed that the notices to explain disprove respondents’ allegation that there was intent to dismiss them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>Grounds for termination of employment are provided under the Labor Code.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup>&nbsp; Just causes for termination of an employee are provided under Article 282 of the Labor Code:<br><br><blockquote>ARTICLE 282. <i>Termination by employer.</i> - An employer may terminate an employment for any of the following causes:<br><br>(a)&nbsp; Serious misconduct or willful disobedience by the employee of the lawful orders of his employer or representative in connection with his work;<br><br>(b) Gross and habitual neglect by the employee of his duties;<br><br>(c)&nbsp; Fraud or willful breach by the employee of the trust reposed in him by his employer or duly authorized representative;<br><br>(d) Commission of a crime or offense by the employee against the person of his employer or any immediate member of his family or his duly authorized representatives; and<br><br>(e)&nbsp; Other causes analogous to the foregoing.</blockquote><br>Although abandonment of work is not included in the enumeration, this court has held that “abandonment is a form of neglect of duty.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup>&nbsp; To prove abandonment, two elements must concur:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>Failure to report for work or absence without valid or justifiable reason; and<br></li><li>A clear intention to sever the employer-employee relationship.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup></li></ol></blockquote><br>In <i>Hodieng Concrete Products v. Emilia,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> this court held that:<br><br><blockquote>Absence must be accompanied by overt acts unerringly pointing to the fact that the employee simply does not want to work anymore. And the burden of proof to show that there was unjustified refusal to go back to work rests on the employer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup></blockquote><br>The Court of Appeals ruled that the alleged abandonment of work is negated by the immediate filing of the complaint for illegal dismissal on May 31, 2005.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup>&nbsp; The Court of Appeals further stated that:<br><br><blockquote>Long standing is the rule that the filing of the complaint for illegal dismissal negates the allegation of abandonment. Human experience dictates that no employee in his right mind would go through the trouble of filing a case unless the employer had indeed terminated the services of the employee.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup></blockquote><br>In this case, Elena failed to pinpoint the overt acts of respondents that show they had abandoned their work.&nbsp; There was a mere allegation that she was “forced to declare them dismissed due to their failure to report back to work for a considerable length of time” but no evidence to prove the intent to abandon work.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup>&nbsp; It is the burden of the employer to prove that the employee was not dismissed or, if dismissed, that such dismissal was not illegal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup>&nbsp; Unfortunately for Elena, she failed to do so.<br><br><b><center>IV.</center><br>Generally, errors of counsel bind<br> the client</b><br><br>Elena’s position paper states the following:<br><br><blockquote>5. Also, Stanley Fine was forced to declare them dismissed due to their failure to report back to work for a considerable length of time and also, <i>due to the filing of an unmeritorious labor case against</i> it by the two complainants. . . . (Emphasis supplied)<br><br>. . . .<br><br>8. The main claim of the complainants is their allegation that they were dismissed. They were <b><u>NOT DISMISSED</u></b>. Management was [sic] has only instructed them to submit a written explanation for their absence before they would be allowed back to work. . . .<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> (Underscoring in the original)</blockquote><br>Elena argued that the use of the word “unmeritorious” should not be taken against her because it is commonly used in pleadings.&nbsp; Also, the use of the word “unmeritorious” came from her previous counsel.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup>&nbsp; In an effort to persuade this court, Elena further argued in her reply that the statement “unmeritorious case” was a mistake committed by her former counsel which should not bind her, considering its grave consequence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, respondents alleged in their position paper<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> that they were requesting from their employer an increase in pay to comply with the minimum wage law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup>&nbsp; However, they were reprimanded and were told “not to work anymore.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>Respondents filed a reply<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> to Elena’s position paper and argued that:<br><br><blockquote>6. The words “Nag complain pa kayo sa Labor ha, tanggal na kayo” were clear, unequivocal and categorical. These circumstances were sufficient to create the impression in the mind of complainants – and correctly so – that their services were being terminated. The acts of respondents were indicative of their intention to dismiss complainants from their employment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup></blockquote><br>On this issue, the National Labor Relations Commission held that the phrase, “filing of an unmeritorious labor complaint,”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> if read together with the other allegations in Elena’s position paper, would show that respondents were not dismissed but simply required to explain their absences.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the Court of Appeals agreed with the Labor Arbiter that Elena’s statement is an admission against interest and binding upon her.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals explained that:<br><br><blockquote>An admission against interest is the best evidence which affords the greatest certainty of the facts in dispute since no man would declare anything against himself unless such declaration is true. Thus, an admission against interest binds the person who makes the same, and absent any showing that this was made thru palpable mistake, no amount of rationalization can offset it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup></blockquote><br>The general rule is that errors of counsel bind the client.&nbsp; The reason behind this rule was discussed in <i>Building Care Corporation v. Macaraeg</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br><blockquote>It is however, an oft-repeated ruling that the negligence and mistakes of counsel bind the client. A departure from this rule would bring about never-ending suits, so long as lawyers could allege their own fault or negligence to support the client’s case and obtain remedies and reliefs already lost by operation of law.

This should be construed as a period of at least five (5) calendar days from receipt of the notice to give the employees an opportunity to study the accusation against them, consult a union official or lawyer, gather data and evidence, and decide on the defenses they will raise against the complaint. Moreover, in order to enable the employees to intelligently prepare their explanation and defenses, the notice should contain a detailed narration of the facts and circumstances that will serve as basis for the charge against the employees. A general description of the charge will not suffice.
