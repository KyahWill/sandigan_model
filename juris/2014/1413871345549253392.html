Case Nos. 00-186069-75, and dismissed the charges against respondents Jose C. Go (Go) and Aida C.

This prompted them to file a petition for <i>certiorari</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; before the CA, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 108319. <b>A copy of said petition was served, however, <u>only on the private complainant,</u><i> i.e.</i>, the PDIC</b>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> <b>and not the People of the Philippines (the People), through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), as it was not even impleaded as party to the case.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br><b><center>The Proceedings Before the CA</center></b><br>In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> dated September 28, 2011, the CA, without first ordering the respondents to implead the People, annulled and set aside the assailed orders of the RTC, and consequently dismissed the criminal cases against respondents.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>It ruled that the prosecution’s prolonged delay in presenting its witnesses and exhibits, and in filing its formal offer of evidence was vexatious, capricious, and oppressive to respondents,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> thereby violating their right to speedy trial. It further held that double jeopardy had already attached in favor of respondents, considering that the criminal cases against them were dismissed due to violation of the right to speedy trial.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, the PDIC moved for reconsideration which was, however, denied by the CA in a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> dated April 17, 2012.<br><br>On May 2, 2012, the PDIC transmitted copies of the aforesaid CA Decision and Resolution to the OSG.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Thereafter, or on June 18, 2012, the OSG filed the instant petition,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> imputing grave abuse of discretion on the part of the CA in giving due course to respondents’ <i>certiorari </i>petition and proceeding to decide the case. It contends, among others, that the People – the petitioner in this case – was neither impleaded nor served a copy of said petition, thereby violating its right to due process of law and rendering the CA without any authority or jurisdiction to promulgate its issuances reversing the RTC Orders and dismissing the criminal cases pending before it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b><br></center><br>The central issue to resolve is whether or not the criminal cases against respondents were properly dismissed by the CA on <i>certiorari</i>, without the People, as represented by the OSG, having been impleaded.<br><br><center><b>The Court’s Ruling</b><br></center><br>The petition is meritorious.<br><br>Respondents’ <i>certiorari </i>petition in CA-G.R. SP No. 108319 that sought the dismissal of the criminal cases against them should not have been resolved by the CA, without the People, as represented by the OSG, having first been impleaded. This stems from the recognition that the People is an indispensable party to the proceedings.<br><br>In <i>Vda. de Manguerra v. Risos</i>,&nbsp; where the petition for <i>certiorari</i> filed with the [CA] failed to implead the People of the Philippines as an indispensable party, the Court held:<br><br><blockquote>It is undisputed that in their petition for <i>certiorari</i> before the CA, respondents failed to implead the People of the Philippines as a party thereto. Because of this, the petition was obviously defective. As provided in Section 5, Rule 110 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, all criminal actions are prosecuted under the direction and control of the public prosecutor. Therefore, it behooved the petitioners (respondents herein) to implead the People of the Philippines as respondent in the CA case to enable the Solicitor General to comment on the petition.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></blockquote><br>While the failure to implead an indispensable party is not<i> per se</i> a ground for the dismissal of an action, considering that said party may still be added by order of the court, on motion of the party or on its own initiative at any stage of the action and/or such times as are just,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> it remains essential – as it is jurisdictional – that any indispensable party be impleaded in the proceedings before the court renders judgment. This is because the absence of such indispensable party renders all subsequent actions of the court null and void for want of authority to act, not only as to the absent parties but even as to those present. As explained in <i>Lotte Phil. Co., Inc. v. Dela Cruz:</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br><blockquote>An indispensable party is a party-in-interest without whom no final determination can be had of an action, and who shall be joined either as plaintiffs or defendants. The joinder of indispensable parties is mandatory. The presence of indispensable parties is necessary to vest the court with jurisdiction, which is “the authority to hear and determine a cause, the right to act in a case.” Thus, without the presence of indispensable parties to a suit or proceeding, judgment of a court cannot attain real finality. The absence of an indispensable party renders all subsequent actions of the court null and void for want of authority to act, not only as to the absent parties but even as to those present.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></blockquote><br>In this case, it is evident that the CA proceeded to render judgment, <i>i.e</i>., the September 28, 2011 Decision and April 17, 2012 Resolution, without an indispensable party,<i> i.e.</i>, the People, having been impleaded. Thus, in light of the foregoing discussion, these issuances should be set aside and the case be remanded to the said court. Consequently, the CA is directed to (a) reinstate respondents’ <i>certiorari</i> petition, and (b) order said respondents to implead the People as a party to the proceedings and thereby furnish its counsel, the OSG, a copy of the aforementioned pleading. That being said, there would be no need to touch on the other issues herein raised.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is<b> GRANTED</b>.
