30% of respondent spouses’ reported or declared income, which under Section 248(B) of the NIRC constitutes as <i>prima facie</i> evidence of false or fraudulent return, petitioner recommended the filing of criminal cases against respondent spouses under Sections 254 and 255, in relation to Section 248(B) of the NIRC.<br><br>The CA, however, found no probable cause to indict respondent spouses for tax evasion. It agreed with Acting Justice Secretary Devanadera that petitioner failed to make “a categorical finding of the exact amount of tax due from [respondent spouses]” and “to show sufficient proof of a likely source of [respondent spouses’] income that enabled them to purchase the real and personal properties adverted to x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>We find otherwise.<br><br>The amount of tax due from respondent spouses was specifically alleged in the Complaint-Affidavit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> The computation, as well as the method used in determining the tax liability, was also clearly explained. The revenue officers likewise showed that the underdeclaration exceeded 30% of the reported or declared income.<br><br>The revenue officers also identified the likely source of the unreported or undeclared income in their Reply-Affidavit. The pertinent portion reads:<br><blockquote>7.&nbsp; x x x x<br><br>[Respondent spouses] are into rental business and the net profit for six (6) years before tax summed only to P1,238,938.32 (an average of more or less Php200,000.00 annually). We asked respondent [Antonio] if we can proceed to his rented property to [appraise] the earning capacity of the building [for] lease/ rent, but he declined our proposition. Due to such refusal made by the respondent, [petitioner], thru its examiners, took pictures of the subject property and came up with the findings that indeed the unexplained funds sought to have been used in acquiring the valuable property in Tagaytay x x x came from the underdeclaration of rental income.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br></blockquote>Apparently, the revenue officers considered respondent Antonio’s rental business to be the likely source of their unreported or undeclared income due to his unjustified refusal to allow the revenue officers to inspect the building.<br><br>Respondent spouses’ defense that they had sufficient savings to purchase the properties remains self-serving at this point since they have not yet presented any evidence to support this. And since there is no evidence yet to suggest that the money they used to buy the properties was from an existing fund, it is safe to assume that that money is income or a flow of wealth other than a mere return on capital. It is a basic concept in taxation that income denotes a flow of wealth during a definite period of time, while capital is a fund or property existing at one distinct point in time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>Moreover, by just looking at the tables presented by petitioner, there is a manifest showing that respondent spouses had underdeclared their income. The huge disparity between respondent Antonio’s reported or declared annual income for the past several years and respondent spouses’ cash acquisitions for the years 2000, 2001, and 2003 cannot be ignored. In fact, it makes us wonder how they were able to purchase the properties in cash given respondent Antonio’s meager income.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, we are convinced that there is probable cause to indict respondent spouses for tax evasion as petitioner was able to show that a tax is due from them. Probable cause, for purposes of filing a criminal information, is defined as such facts that are sufficient to engender a well-founded belief that a crime has been committed, that the accused is probably guilty thereof, and that he should be held for trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> It bears stressing that the determination of probable cause does not require actual or absolute certainty, nor clear and convincing evidence of guilt; it only requires reasonable belief or probability that more likely than not a crime has been committed by the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>In completely disregarding the evidence presented and in affirming the ruling of the Acting Justice Secretary Devanadera that no probable cause exists, we find that the CA committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. As we have said, if there is grave abuse of discretion, the court may step in and proceed to make its own independent determination of probable cause as judicial review is allowed to ensure that the Executive Department acts within the permissible bounds of its authority or does not gravely abuse the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>We must make it clear, however, that we are only here to determine probable cause. As to whether respondent spouses are guilty of tax evasion is an issue that must be resolved during the trial of the criminal case, where the quantum of proof required is proof beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>Before we close, we must stress that our ruling in this case should not be interpreted as an unbridled license for our tax officials to engage in fishing expeditions and witch-hunting. They should not abuse their investigative powers, instead they should exercise the same within the bounds of the law. They must properly observe the guidelines in making assessments and investigative procedures to ensure that the constitutional rights of the taxpayers are well protected as we cannot allow the floodgates to be opened for frivolous and malicious tax suits.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is hereby <b>GRANTED</b>.
