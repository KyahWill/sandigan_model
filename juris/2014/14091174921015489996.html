Julia posited that Naval had fully served the entire Province of Camarines Sur for three consecutive terms as a member of the <i>Sanggunian</i>, irrespective of the district he had been elected from. The three-term limit rule’s application is more with reference to the same local elective post, and not necessarily in connection with an identical territorial jurisdiction. Allowing Naval to run as a <i>Sanggunian</i> member for the fourth time is violative of the inflexible three-term limit rule enshrined in the Constitution and the LGC, which must be strictly construed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br><b><center>The Resolution of the COMELEC Second Division</center></b><br>In the first assailed resolution issued on March 5, 2013, the COMELEC Second Division cancelled Naval’s COC on grounds stated below:<br><br><blockquote>[W]hen a candidate for public office swears in his COC that he is eligible for the elective posts he seeks, while, in reality, he knowingly lacks the necessary requirements for eligibility, he commits a false material misrepresentation cognizable under Section 78 of the [OEC].<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The Supreme Court[,] in the case of Lonzanida v. [COMELEC][,] detailed the important components of [Article X, Section 8 of the Constitution]:<br><blockquote>This Court held that the two conditions for the application of the disqualification must concur: 1) <b>that the official concerned has been elected for three consecutive terms in the same local government post and 2) that he has fully served three consecutive terms</b>. It stated:<br><blockquote>To recapitulate, the term limit for elective local officials must be taken to refer to the right to be elected as well as the right to <i>serve </i>in the same elective position. Consequently, it is not enough that an individual has served three consecutive terms in an elective local office[;] he must also have been <i>elected</i> to the same position for the same number of times before the disqualification can apply. x x x</blockquote></blockquote>x x x The first requisite does not only describe a candidate who has been elected for public office for three consecutive terms. The candidate must have been elected in the same local government post. This connotes that the candidate must have been in the same elective position serving the same constituency who elected him to office for three consecutive terms.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The three-term limit rule was designed by the framers of the Constitution to prevent the monopoly of power centered only on a chosen few. The said disqualification was primarily intended to forestall the accumulation of massive political power by an elective local government official in a given locality in order to perpetuate his tenure in office. The framers also considered the necessity of the enhancement of the freedom of choice of the electorate by broadening the selection of would-be elective public officers. By rendering ineligible for public office those who have been elected and served for three consecutive terms in the same public elective post, the prohibition seeks to infuse new blood in the political arena.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>x x x [T]he new Third District where [Naval] was elected and has served is composed of the same municipalities comprising the previous Second District, absent the towns Gainza and [Milaor]. The territorial jurisdiction [Naval] seeks to serve for the term 2013-2016 is the same as the territorial jurisdiction he previously served. The electorate who voted for him in 2004, 2007 and 2010 is the same electorate who shall vote for him come May 13, 2013 Elections. They are the same group of voters who elected him into office for three consecutive terms.<br><br>The resolution of this Commission in the case of Bandillo, et al[.] v. Hernandez (SPA No. 10-078)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> cannot be applied in the case at bar. Hernandez who then hailed from Libmanan belonged to the First District of Camarines Sur. With Republic Act 9716, Libmanan, Minalabac, Pamplona, Pasacao and San Fernando, all originally belonging to the First District, were merged with Gainza and Milaor to form the Second District. With the addition of the municipalities of Gainza and Milaor, it cannot be said that the previous First District became the Second District only by name. The voters of Gainza and Milaor added to the electorate of the new Second District formed a different electorate, different from the one which voted for Hernandez in the 2001, 2004 and 2007 elections. In the case at bar, the municipalities comprising the new Third District are the same municipalities that consisted of the previous Second [District], absent Milaor and Gainza.<br><br>The Supreme Court, in Latasa v. [COMELEC], ruled that the conversion of the municipality into a city did not convert the office of the municipal mayor into a local government post different from the office of the city mayor[.]<br><br>x x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote><br><b><center>The Resolution of the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i><br></center></b><br>In the second assailed resolution issued on June 5, 2013, the COMELEC <i>en banc </i>denied Naval’s Motion for Reconsideration to the above. The COMELEC pointed out that absent the verification required under Section 3, Rule 19 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure, Naval’s motion was instantly dismissible. Nonetheless, the COMELEC proceeded to discuss the demerits of Naval’s motion, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>The conditions for the application of the three-term limit rule are present in the instant case as the records clearly establish that [Naval] is running for the 4<sup>th</sup> time for the same government post. To put things in a proper perspective, it is imperative to review and discuss the salient points in the case of <b>Latasa v. [COMELEC]</b>. The case involves the question of whether or not a municipal mayor, having been elected and had already served for three (3) consecutive terms, can run as city mayor in light of the conversion of the municipality to a city. In applying the three-term limit rule, the Court pointed out that the conversion of the municipality into a city did not convert the office of the municipal mayor into a local government post different from the office of the city mayor. The Court took into account the following circumstances: (1) That the territorial jurisdiction of [the] city was the same as that of the municipality; (2) That the inhabitants were the same group of voters who elected the municipal mayor for three (3) consecutive terms; and (3) That the inhabitants were the same group of voters [over] whom he held power and authority as their chief executive for nine years.<br><br>Anchoring from the said case, it is therefore clear that the position to which [Naval] has filed his candidacy for the 13 May 2013 x x x Elections is the same position for which he had been elected and had served for the past nine (9) years.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>x x x The following circumstances establish that the subject posts are one and the same: First, the territorial jurisdictions of the two (2) districts are the same except for the municipalities of Gainza and Milaor which were excluded by R.A. No. 9716; Second, the inhabitants of the 3<sup>rd</sup> District of Camarines Sur, where [Naval] is presently running as member of the [Sanggunian], are the same voters who elected him for the past three (3) consecutive terms; and Lastly, the inhabitants of the [3<sup>rd</sup>] District are the same group of voters whom [Naval] had served as member of the [Sanggunian] representing the 2<sup>nd</sup> District.<br><br>x x x The enactment of R.A. No. 9716 did not convert [Naval’s] post [into one] different from [w]hat he [previously had]. As correctly ruled by the Commission (<i>Second Division</i>), [Naval] ha[d] already been elected and ha[d] already served in the same government post for three consecutive terms, x x x[.]<br><br>x x x x.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote><br><b>Unperturbed, Naval is now before the Court raising the issues of whether or not the COMELEC gravely erred and ruled contrary to law and jurisprudence:</b><br><br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li>IN FINDING THAT NAVAL HAD ALREADY SERVED FOR THREE CONSECUTIVE TERMS IN THE SAME GOVERNMENT POST;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br></li><li>IN IGNORING THE FACT THAT SANGGUNIAN MEMBERS ARE ELECTED BY LEGISLATIVE DISTRICTS;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> and<br><br></li><li>WHEN IT RULED THAT THE PROHIBITION CONTEMPLATED BY SECTION 8, ARTICLE X OF THE 1987 CONSTITUTION AND SECTION 43(B) OF THE LGC APPLIES TO NAVAL.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></li></ol></blockquote><br><center><b>The Arguments of the Contending Parties</b><br></center><br>In support of the instant petition, Naval alleges that the First, Second and Third Legislative Districts of Camarines Sur are not merely renamed but are composed of new sets of municipalities. With the separation of Gainza and Milaor from the other eight towns which used to comprise the Second District, the voters from the Third Legislative District are no longer the same ones as those who had elected him to office in the 2004 and 2007 elections.<br><br>Naval further invokes Article 94<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> of Administrative Order No. 270 prescribing the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the LGC to argue that <i>Sanggunian</i> members are elected by districts. Thus, the right to choose representatives in the <i>Sanggunian</i> pertains to each of the districts. Naval was elected as <i>Sanggunian</i> member in 2004 and 2007 by the Second District. In 2010 and 2013, it was the Third District, which brought him to office. Essentially then, Naval’s election in 2013 is merely his second term as<i> Sanggunian</i> member for the Third District.<br><br>Naval likewise cites <i>Borja, Jr. v. COMELEC</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> to point out that for the disqualification on the ground of the three-term limit to apply, it is not enough that an individual has served three consecutive terms in an elective local office, but it is also required that he or she had been elected to the same position for the same number of times.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Naval also assails as erroneous the COMELEC’s interpretations of the rulings in <i>Latasa v. COMELEC</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> and <i>Bandillo, et al. v. Hernandez.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> In <i>Latasa,</i> the Court applied the three-term prohibition only because notwithstanding the conversion of the Municipality of Digos into a city, the mayor was to serve the same territorial jurisdiction and constituents. Naval asserts that the same does not hold true in his case. Naval further avers that in<i> Bandillo</i>, which finds more application in the instant petition, the COMELEC ruled that the three-term limit cannot be invoked in a situation where the legislative districts have been altered. An extraction or an addition both yields a change in the composition of the voters.<br><br>Naval further emphasizes that he garnered the majority of the votes from his constituents, whose will and mandate should be upheld. Besides, Julia’s counsel already withdrew his appearance, indicating no less than his client’s lack of interest in still pursuing Naval’s ouster from office.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>In its Comment,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) seeks the denial of the instant petition. The OSG contends that Naval had been elected and had fully served the same local elective post for three consecutive terms. Naval thus violated Section 78 of the OEC when he filed his COC despite knowledge of his ineligibility. Naval’s reliance on <i>Bandillo</i> is also misplaced since in the said case, two towns were instead added to form a new district. Apparently then, in <i>Bandillo,</i> there was a new set of voters. The OSG also alleges that Naval is not entitled to the issuance of injunctive reliefs by this Court. No clear and unmistakable right pertains to Naval and it is his eligibility to be elected as <i>Sanggunian</i> member for the Third District which is the issue at hand.<br><br><center><b>Ruling of the Court</b></center><br>The Court denies the petition.<br><br>As the issues are interrelated, they shall be discussed jointly.<br><br>The case before this Court is one of first impression. While the contending parties cite <i>Latasa, Lonzanida v. COMELEC</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><i> Borja, Aldovino, Jr. v. COMELEC,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> and <i>Bandillo</i>, which all involve the application of the three-term limit rule, the factual and legal circumstances in those cases are different and the doctrinal values therein do not directly address the issues now at hand.<br><br>In <i>Latasa</i>, the issue arose as a result of the conversion of a municipality into a city. The then municipal mayor attempted to evade the application upon him of the three-term limit rule by arguing that the position of a city mayor was not the same as the one he previously held. The Court was not convinced and, thus, declared that there was no interruption of the incumbent mayor’s continuity of service.<br><br>In <i>Lonzanida</i>, a candidate ran for the mayoralty post and won in three consecutive elections. While serving his third term, his opponent filed an election protest. Months before the expiration of the mayor’s third term, he was ousted from office. He ran again for the same post in the immediately succeeding election. A petition was thereafter filed assailing his eligibility to run as mayor on the ground of violation of the three-term limit rule. The Court ruled that the mayor could not be considered as having served a full third term. An interruption for any length of time, if due to an involuntary cause, is enough to break the elected official’s continuity of service.<br><br>In <i>Borja</i>, the mayor of Pateros died and was succeeded in office by the vice mayor. In the two immediately succeeding elections, the latter vied for and won the mayoralty post. When he ran for the same position for the third time, his disqualification was sought for alleged violation of the three-term limit rule. The Court ruled that when he assumed the position of mayor by virtue of succession, his service should not be treated as one full term. For the disqualification to apply, the candidate should have been thrice elected for and had served the same post consecutively.<br><br>In <i>Aldovino</i>, preventive suspension was imposed upon an elected municipal councilor. The Court ruled that the said suspension did not interrupt the elective official’s term. Although he was barred from exercising the functions of the position during the period of suspension, his continued stay and entitlement to the office remain unaffected.<br><br>In<i> Bandillo</i>, a case decided by the COMELEC, Gainza and Milaor were added to five of the ten towns, which used to comprise Camarines Sur’s old First District, to form the new Second District. The COMELEC declined to apply the three-term limit rule against the elected Provincial Board member on the ground that the addition of Gainza and Milaor distinctively created a new district, with an altered territory and constituency.<br><br>In the case before this Court, the task is to determine the application of the three-term limit rule upon local elective officials in renamed and/or reapportioned districts. In the process of doing so, it is inevitable to discuss the role of elections and the nature of public office in a democratic and republican state like ours.<br><br><b>The Role of Elections in our <br>Democratic and Republican <br>State, and the Restraints Imposed <br>Upon Those Who Hold Public Office</b><br><br>The Court begins with general and undeniable principles.<br><br>The Philippines is a democratic and republican State. Sovereignty resides in the people and all government authority emanates from them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Then Associate Justice Reynato S. Puno explained the character of a republican state and a public office, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>A republic is a representative government, a government run by and for the people. It is not a pure democracy where the people govern themselves directly. The essence of republicanism is <b>representation and renovation, the selection by the citizenry of a corps of public functionaries who derive their mandate from the people and act on their behalf, serving for a limited period only</b>, after which they are replaced or retained, at the option of their principal. <i>Obviously, a republican government is a responsible government whose officials hold and discharge their position as a public trust and shall, according to the Constitution, ‘at all times be accountable to the people’ they are sworn to serve. The purpose of a republican government it is almost needless to state, is the promotion of the common welfare according to the will of the people themselves</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> (Emphasis ours and italics in the original)</blockquote><br>In <i>Tolentino v. COMELEC,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Justice Puno likewise characterized the role of the electoral process in the following wise:<br><br><blockquote>The electoral process is one of the linchpins of a democratic and republican framework because it is through the act of voting that government by consent is secured. Through the ballot, people express their will on the defining issues of the day and they are able to choose their leaders in accordance with the fundamental principle of representative democracy that the people should elect whom they please to govern them. <i>Voting has an important instrumental value in preserving the viability of constitutional democracy. It has traditionally been taken as a prime indicator of democratic participation</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> (Citations omitted and italics ours)</blockquote><br>The importance of elections cannot therefore be over emphasized. Thus,<br><br><blockquote>True,<i> election is the expression of the sovereign power of the people.</i> In the exercise of suffrage, a free people expects to achieve the continuity of government and the perpetuation of its benefits. <i>However, inspite of its importance, the privileges and rights arising from having been elected may be enlarged or restricted by law</i>. x x x.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> (Italics ours)</blockquote><br>Hence, while it is settled that in elections, the first consideration of every democratic polity is to give effect to the expressed will of the majority, there are limitations to being elected to a public office.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Our Constitution and statutes are explicit anent the existence of term limits, the nature of public office, and the guarantee from the State that citizens shall have equal access to public service.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Section 8, Article X of our Constitution, on term limits, is significantly reiterated by Section 43(b) of the LGC. Moreover, the Court has time and again declared that a public office is a public trust and not a vested property right.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br><b>The Deliberations of the Members<br>of the Constitutional Commission on the<br>Three-Term Limit’s Application to Local <br>Elective Officials</b><br><br>Following are entries in the Journal of the Constitutional Commission regarding the exchanges of the members on the subject of the three-term limit rule imposed on local elective officials:<br><br><blockquote>VOTING ON THE TERMS OF LOCAL OFFICIALS<br><br>With respect to local officials, Mr. Nolledo, informed that the Committee on Local Governments had not decided on the term of office for local officials and suggested that the Body decide on the matter.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>On Mr. Bacani’s inquiry regarding local officials, Mr. Davide explained that local officials would include the governor, vice-governor and <b><i>the members of the provincial board</i></b>; the city mayor, city vice-mayor and members of the city board; and the municipal mayor, municipal vice mayor and members of the municipal council.

GARCIA ON ALTERNATIVE NO. 1<br><br>Mr. Garcia stated that he was advocating Alternative No. 1 on four grounds: 1) <b><i>to prevent monopoly of political power</i></b> because the country’s history showed <b><i>that prolonged stay in public office could lead to the creation of entrenched preserves</i></b> of political dynasties; 2) <b><i>to broaden the choice</i></b> so that more people could be enlisted to the cause of public service; 3) <b><i>no one is indispensable in running the affairs of the country</i></b> and that reliance on personalities would be avoided; and 4) the disqualification from running for reelection after three terms would <b><i>create a reserve of statesmen both in the local and national levels.</i></b><br><br>He added that the turnover in public office after nine years <b><i>would ensure the introduction of new ideas and approaches</i></b>. He stressed that <b><i>public office would no longer be a preserve of conservatism and tradition</i></b>, and that public service would no longer be limited to those directly holding public office, but would also include consultative bodies organized by the people.<br><br>INQUIRY OF MR.

He opined, however, that <b><i>perpetual disqualification would deprive the people of their freedom of choice.</i></b> He stated <b><i>that the Body had already succeeded in striking a balance on policies which could ensure a redistribution of opportunities to the people both in terms of political and economic power</i></b>. He stated that Philippine politics had been unshackled from the two-party system, which he said was the most critical support for the perpetuation of political dynasties. Considering that such achievement is already a victory, Mr. Ople stated that the role of political parties should not be despised because the strength of democracy depends on how strong political parties are, that a splintering thereof will mean a great loss to the vitality and resiliency of democracy.<br><br>Mr. Ople reiterated that he was against perpetual disqualification from office.<br><br>x x x x.<br><br>MR. GARCIA’S RESPONSE TO MR. OPLE’S STATEMENTS<br><br>Mr. Garcia stated that there are two principles involved in Alternative No. 1: 1 ) the <b><i>recognition of the ambivalent nature of political power, and 2) the recognition of alternative forms of public service</i></b>. He stated that it is important to remember the lessons learned from the recent past; that public service is service to the people and not an opportunity to accumulate political power, and that <b><i>a prolonged stay in public office brings about political dynasties or vested interests</i></b>. Regarding political parties, he stated that it will <b><i>encourage the constant renewal of blood in party leadership, approach, style and ideas. He opined that this is very healthy for a pluralist and multi-party democracy.</i></b><br><br>On the recognition of alternative forms of public service, Mr. Garcia stressed that public service could be limited to public office since many good leaders who were in the streets and in jail fought against the dictatorship. He stressed that public service would also mean belonging to consultative bodies or people’s councils which brought about new forms of service and leadership.<br><br>REMARKS OF MR. ABUBAKAR<br><br>Mr. Abubakar stated that <b><i>in any democracy the voice of the people is the voice of God</i></b>. He stated that if the people want to elect a representative to serve them continuously, the Commission should not arrogate unto itself the right to decide what the people want. He stated that in the United States, a Senator had served for 30 years.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>REMARKS OF MS. AQUINO<br><br>Ms. Aquino stated that she differs from the views advanced by Mr. Garcia and Ms. Tan, although she stated that they spoke of the same premises. She stated that she agrees with them <b><i>that leaders need not be projected and developed publicly in an election as leaders are better tempered and tested in the various forms of mass struggles and organized work</i></b>. She stated that if the people are to be encouraged to have their own sense of responsibility in national leadership, what ultimately matters is the political determination of the citizenry to chart their own national destiny. <b><i>She opined that the Body should allow the people to exercise their own sense of proportion and imbibe the salutary effects of their own strength to curtail power when it overreaches itself.</i></b> She stressed that in the final analysis, <b><i>the Commission cannot legislate into the Constitution the essence of new politics as it is a chastening experience of learning and unlearning</i></b>. Adverting to Mr. Garcia’s statement that politics is an imperfect art, she stated that the Commission could correct politics with all its imperfections and flaws by a constitutional provision. She opined that perpetual disqualification cannot provide the cure. She maintained that perpetual disqualification is, at best, a palliative which could also be counter-productive, in the sense that it could effectively foil the possibilities of real public service.<br><br>REMARKS OF MR. BACANI<br><br>Mr. Bacani stated that when the Body granted the illiterates the right to vote and that proposals were made to empower the people to engage in the legislative process, <b><i>the Body presupposed the political maturity of the people. He observed that in this instance, political maturity is denied with the constitutional bar for reelection</i></b>. He opined that the Body should stick to the premise that the people are politically mature.<br><br>REJOINDER OF MR. GARCIA<br><br>By way of rejoinder to Mr. Bacani’s statements, <b><i>Mr. Garcia stated that the proposal was basically premised on the undue advantage of the incumbent in accumulating power, money, party machine and patronage and not on lack of trust in the people.</i></b><br><br>Mr. Garcia stated that politics is not won by ideals alone but by solid organized work by organizations. He stated that with three terms, an official would have served the people long enough.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>VOTING ON THE TWO ALTERNATIVES<br><br>Thereafter, the Body proceeded to vote by ballot on the two alternatives.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>RESULT OF THE VOTING<br><br>The result of the voting was as follows:<br><br>Alternative No. 1 (no further election after three successive terms) — 17 votes<br><br>Alternative No. 2 (no immediate reelection after three successive terms) — 26 votes<br><br>With 17 votes in favor of Alternative No. 1 and 26 in favor of Alternative No. 2, the Chair declared Alternative No. 2 approved by the Body.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> (Emphasis and italics ours)</blockquote><br><b>The Constitution mandates the <br>strict implementation of the <br>three-term limit rule.&nbsp; </b><br><br>The Court notes that in the process of drafting the Constitution, the framers thereof had not discussed with specifity the subject of the three-term limit rule’s application on reapportioned districts.<br><br>From the above-cited deliberations, however, the divergent stances of the members of the Constitutional Commission on the general application of the three-term limit rule show. On one side were those who espoused the stern view that perpetual disqualification to hold public office after three consecutive terms would ensure that new blood would be infused into our political system. More choices for the voters would give fuller meaning to our democratic institutions. On the other side of the fence were those who believed that the imposition of term limits would be tantamount to squandering the experience of seasoned public servants and a curtailment of the power of the citizens to elect whoever they want to remain in office.<br><br>In the end, 26 members of the Commission cast their votes in favor of the proposal that no immediate re-election after three successive terms shall be allowed. On the other hand, 17 members stood pat on their view that there should be no further reelection after three successive terms.<br><br>Clearly, the drafters of our Constitution are in agreement about the possible attendant evils if there would be no limit to re-election. Notwithstanding their conflicting preferences on whether the term limit would disqualify the elected official perpetually or temporarily, they decided that only three consecutive elections to the same position would be allowed. Thereafter, the public official can once again vie for the same post provided there be a gap of at least one term from his or her last election. The rule answers the need to prevent the consolidation of political power in the hands of the few, while at the same time giving to the people the freedom to call back to public service those who are worthy to be called statesmen.<br><br>The compromise agreed upon by the drafters of our Constitution was a result of exhaustive deliberations. The required gap after three consecutive elections is significant. Thus, the rule cannot be taken with a grain of salt. Nothing less than its strict application is called for.<br><br><i>Ratio legis est anima</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>“A foolproof yardstick in constitutional construction is the intention underlying the provision under consideration.

However, the wordings of R.A. No. 9716 indicate the intent of the lawmakers to create a single new Second District from the merger of the towns from the old First District with Gainza and Milaor. As to the current Third District, Section 3(c) of R.A. No. 9716 used the word “<i>rename.</i>” Although the qualifier “<i>without a change in its composition</i>” was not found in Section 3(c), unlike in Sections 3(d) and (e), still, what is pervasive is the clear intent to create a sole new district in that of the Second, while merely renaming the rest.<br><br>The following statutory construction rules surface:<br><br><blockquote><b><i>First,</i></b> the general rule in construing words and phrases used in a statute is that, in the absence of legislative intent to the contrary, they should be given their plain, ordinary and common usage meaning; the words should be read and considered in their natural, ordinary, commonly accepted usage, and without resorting to forced or subtle construction.

This numerical fact renders the new Third District as essentially, although not literally, the same as the old Second District. Hence, while Naval is correct in his argument that <i>Sanggunian</i> members are elected by district, it does not alter the fact that the district which elected him for the third and fourth time is the same one which brought him to office in 2004 and 2007.<br><br><b>The application upon Naval of the<br> three-term limit rule does not <br>undermine the constitutional <br>requirement to achieve equality <br>of representation among districts.</b><br><br>The rationale behind reapportionment is the constitutional requirement to achieve equality of representation among the districts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> It is with this mindset that the Court should consider Naval’s argument anent having a new set of constituents electing him into office in 2010 and 2013.<br><br>Naval’s ineligibility to run, by reason of violation of the three-term limit rule, does not undermine the right to equal representation of any of the districts in Camarines Sur.

For the Court to declare otherwise would be to create a dangerous precedent unintended by the drafters of our Constitution and of R.A. No. 9716. Considering that the one-term gap or rest after three consecutive elections is a result of a compromise among the members of the Constitutional Commission, no cavalier exemptions or exceptions to its application is to be allowed. <i>Aldovino </i>affirms this interpretation. Further, sustaining Naval’s arguments would practically allow him to hold the same office for 15 years. These are the circumstances the Constitution explicitly intends to avert.<br><br>Certainly, the Court accords primacy to upholding the will of the voting public, the real sovereign, so to speak. However, let all the candidates for public office be reminded that as citizens, we have a commitment to be bound by our Constitution and laws.

The gist of the story follows.<br><br>In Odyssey Book XII, the goddess Circe warned Odysseus of the Sirens who seduce all men approaching them with their voices. Those who fell into the Sirens’ trap never returned home to their wives and children. A clever strategy was thus hatched to secure safe passage for Odysseus and his men. The men were to plug their ears with wax to muffle the songs of the Sirens. Odysseus, on the other hand, was to be tied to the mast of the ship so he could still listen to the songs, which may contain clues on how they can get home. When the wind died down, Odysseus heard beautiful voices calling out to them. The voices were incomparable to anything he had ever heard before. Even when Odysseus knew that the irresistible voices were coming from the Sirens, he struggled with all his strength to free himself from the ropes, but was unable to do so. The voices became fainter as the men continued to row. When the voices can no longer be heard, Odysseus realized how he had nearly been beguiled. They had made it through safely and Odysseus was untied. It was their clever plan which kept them all alive.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>The same lesson holds true in the case before this Court. The drafters of the Constitution recognized the propensity of public officers to perpetuate themselves in power, hence, the adoption of term limits and a guarantee of every citizen’s equal access to public service. These are the restrictions statesmen should observe for they are intended to help ensure the continued vitality of our republican institutions.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE, IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING</b>, the petition is DENIED.
