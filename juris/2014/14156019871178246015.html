				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The Court of Appeals’ (CA) imposition of 12% interest on the P13,080.93 premium refund is the only matter in question in this case.<br><br>This Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> assails the October 17, 2007 Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of CA in CA-G.R. CV No. 86923, which, among others, imposed a 12% <i>per annum</i> rate of interest reckoned from the time of death of the insured until fully paid, on the premium to be reimbursed by petitioner Sun Life of Canada (Philippines), Inc. (petitioner) to respondents Sandra Tan Kit (respondent Tan Kit) and the Estate of the Deceased Norberto Tan Kit (respondent estate). Likewise assailed in this Petition is the CA’s June 12, 2008 Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> denying petitioner’s Motion for Reconsideration of the said Decision.<br><br><b><i>Factual Antecedents</i></b><br><br>Respondent Tan Kit is the widow and designated beneficiary of Norberto Tan Kit (Norberto), whose application for a life insurance policy,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> with face value of P300,000.00, was granted by petitioner on October 28, 1999. On February 19, 2001, or within the two-year contestability period,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Norberto died of disseminated gastric carcinoma.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Consequently, respondent Tan Kit filed a claim under the subject policy.<br><br>In a Letter<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> dated September 3, 2001, petitioner denied respondent Tan Kit’s claim on account of Norberto’s failure to fully and faithfully disclose in his insurance application certain material and relevant information about his health and smoking history. Specifically, Norberto answered “No” to the question inquiring whether he had smoked cigarettes or cigars within the last 12 months prior to filling out said application.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> However, the medical report of Dr. Anna Chua (Dr. Chua), one of the several physicians that Norberto consulted for his illness, reveals that he was a smoker and had only stopped smoking in August 1999. According to petitioner, its underwriters would not have approved Norberto’s application for life insurance had they been given the correct information. Believing that the policy is null and void, petitioner opined that its liability is limited to the refund of all the premiums paid. Accordingly, it enclosed in the said letter a check for P13,080.93 representing the premium refund.<br><br>In a letter<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> dated September 13, 2001, respondent Tan Kit refused to accept the check and insisted on the payment of the insurance proceeds.<br><br>On October 4, 2002, petitioner filed a Complaint<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> for Rescission of Insurance Contract before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Makati City.<br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Regional Trial Court</i></b><br><br>In its November 30, 2005 Decision,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> the RTC noted that petitioner’s physician, Dr. Charity Salvador (Dr. Salvador), conducted medical examination on Norberto. Moreover, petitioner’s agent, Irma Joy E. Javelosa (Javelosa), answered “NO” to the question “<i>Are you aware of anything about the life to be insured’s lifestyle, hazardous sports, habits, medical history, or any risk factor that would have an adverse effect on insurability?</i>” in her Agent’s Report. Javelosa also already knew Norberto two years prior to the approval of the latter’s application for insurance. The RTC concluded that petitioner, through the above-mentioned circumstances, had already cleared Norberto of any misrepresentation that he may have committed. The RTC also opined that the affidavit of Dr. Chua, presented as part of petitioner’s evidence and which confirmed the fact that the insured was a smoker and only stopped smoking a year ago [1999], is hearsay since Dr. Chua did not testify in court. Further, since Norberto had a subsisting insurance policy with petitioner during his application for insurance subject of this case, it was incumbent upon petitioner to ascertain the health condition of Norberto considering the additional burden that it was assuming. Lastly, petitioner did not comply with the requirements for rescission of insurance contract as held in <i>Philamcare Health Systems, Inc. v. Court of Appeals</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Thus, the dispositive portion of the RTC Decision:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing considerations, this court hereby finds in favor of the [respondents and] against the [petitioner], hence it hereby orders the [petitioner] to pay the [respondent], Sandra Tan Kit, the sum of Philippine Pesos: THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND (P300,000.00), representing the face value of the insurance policy with interest at six percent (6%) per annum from October 4, 2002 until fully paid.<br><br>Cost de oficio.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Petitioner moved for reconsideration,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> but was denied in an Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> dated February 15, 2006.<br><br>Hence, petitioner appealed to the CA.<br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</i></b><br><br>On appeal, the CA reversed and set aside the RTC’s ruling in its Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> dated October 17, 2007.<br><br>From the records, the CA found that prior to his death, Norberto had consulted two physicians, Dr. Chua on August 19, 2000, and Dr. John Ledesma (Dr. Ledesma) on December 28, 2000, to whom he confided that he had stopped smoking only in 1999. At the time therefore that he applied for insurance policy on October 28, 1999, there is no truth to his claim that he did not smoke cigarettes within 12 months prior to the said application. The CA thus held that Norberto is guilty of concealment which misled petitioner in forming its estimates of the risks of the insurance policy. This gave petitioner the right to rescind the insurance contract which it properly exercised in this case.<br><br>In addition, the CA held that the content of Norberto’s medical records are deemed admitted by respondents since they failed to deny the same despite having received from petitioner a Request for Admission pursuant to Rule 26 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> And since an admission is in the nature of evidence the legal effects of which form part of the records, the CA discredited the RTC’s ruling that the subject medical records and the affidavits executed by Norberto’s physicians attesting to the truth of the same were hearsay.<br><br>The dispositive portion of the CA Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the foregoing considered, the instant appeal is hereby GRANTED and the appealed Decision REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and in lieu thereof, a judgment is hereby rendered GRANTING the complaint <i>a quo</i>.<br><br>Accordingly, [petitioner] is ordered to reimburse [respondents] the sum of P13,080.93 representing the [premium] paid by the insured <b>with interest at the rate of 12% per annum from the time of the death of the insured until fully paid.</b><br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></blockquote><br>The parties filed their separate motions for reconsideration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> While respondents questioned the factual and legal bases of the CA Decision, petitioner, on the other hand, assailed the imposition of interest on the premium ordered refunded to respondents.<br><br>However, the appellate court denied the motions in its June 12, 2008 Resolution,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the foregoing considered, the separate motions for reconsideration filed by the [petitioner] and the [respondents] are hereby DENIED.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Only petitioner appealed to this Court through the present Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i>.<br><br><center><b>Issue</b><br></center><br>The sole issue in this case is whether petitioner is liable to pay interest on the premium to be refunded to respondents.<br><br><b><i>The Parties’ Arguments</i></b><br><br>Petitioner argues that no interest should have been imposed on the premium to be refunded because the CA Decision does not provide any legal or factual basis therefor; that petitioner directly and timely tendered to respondents an amount representing the premium refund but they rejected it since they opted to pursue their claim for the proceeds of the insurance policy; that respondents should bear the consequence of their unsound decision of rejecting the refund tendered to them; and, that petitioner is not guilty of delay or of invalid or unjust rescission as to make it liable for interest. Hence, following the ruling in <i>Tio Khe Chio v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> no interest can be assessed against petitioner.<br><br>Respondents, on the other hand, contend that the reimbursement of premium is clearly a money obligation or one that arises from forbearance of money, hence, the imposition of 12% interest <i>per annum</i> is just, proper and supported by jurisprudence. While they admit that they refused the tender of payment of the premium refund, they aver that they only did so because they did not want to abandon their claim for the proceeds of the insurance policy. In any case, what petitioner should have done under the circumstances was to consign the amount of payment in court during the pendency of the case.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br><i>Tio Khe Chio is not applicable in this case.</i><br><br>Petitioner avers that <i>Tio Khe Chio</i>, albeit pertaining to marine insurance, is instructive on the issue of payment of interest. There, the Court pointed to Sections 243 and 244 of the Insurance Code which explicitly provide for payment of interest when there is <i>unjustified refusal or withholding of payment of the claim by the insurer</i>, <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> and to Article 2209<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> of the New Civil Code which likewise provides for payment of interest when the debtor is in <i>delay.</i><br><br>The Court finds, however, that <i>Tio Khe Chio</i> is not applicable here as it deals with payment of interest on the insurance<i> proceeds</i> in which the claim therefor was either unreasonably denied or withheld or the insurer incurred delay in the payment thereof. In this case, what is involved is an order for petitioner to refund to respondents the insurance <i>premium</i> paid by Norberto as a consequence of the rescission of the insurance contract on account of the latter’s concealment of material information in his insurance application. Moreover, petitioner did not unreasonably deny or withhold the insurance proceeds as it was satisfactorily established that Norberto was guilty of concealment.<br><br><i>Nature of interest imposed by the</i> CA<br><br>There are two kinds of interest – monetary and compensatory.<br><br>“Monetary interest refers to the compensation set by the parties for the use or forbearance of money.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> No such interest shall be due unless it has been expressly stipulated in writing.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> “On the other hand, compensatory interest refers to the penalty or indemnity for damages imposed by law or by the courts.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> The interest mentioned in Articles 2209 and 2212<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> of the Civil Code applies to compensatory interest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Clearly and contrary to respondents’ assertion, the interest imposed by the CA is not monetary interest because aside from the fact that there is no use or forbearance of money involved in this case, the subject interest was not one which was agreed upon by the parties in writing. This being the case and judging from the tenor of the CA, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Accordingly, [petitioner] is ordered to reimburse [respondents] the sum of P13,080.93 representing the [premium] paid by the insured <b>with interest at the rate of 12% per annum from time of death of the insured until fully paid.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></blockquote><br>there can be no other conclusion than that the interest imposed by the appellate court is in the nature of compensatory interest.<br><br><i>The CA incorrectly imposed<br>compensatory interest on the premium<br>refund reckoned from the time of death<br>of the insured until fully paid</i><br><br>As a form of damages, compensatory interest is due only if the obligor is proven to have failed to comply with his obligation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>In this case, it is undisputed that simultaneous to its giving of notice to respondents that it was rescinding the policy due to concealment, petitioner tendered the refund of premium by attaching to the said notice a check representing the amount of refund. However, respondents refused to accept the same since they were seeking for the release of the proceeds of the policy. Because of this discord, petitioner filed for judicial rescission of the contract. Petitioner, after receiving an adverse judgment from the RTC, appealed to the CA. And as may be recalled, the appellate court found Norberto guilty of concealment and thus upheld the rescission of the insurance contract and consequently decreed the obligation of petitioner to return to respondents the premium paid by Norberto. Moreover, we find that petitioner did not incur delay or unjustifiably deny the claim.<br><br>Based on the foregoing, we find that petitioner properly complied with its obligation under the law and contract. Hence, it should not be made liable to pay compensatory interest.<br><br>Considering the prevailing circumstances of the case, we hereby direct petitioner to reimburse the premium paid within 15 days from date of finality of this Decision. If petitioner fails to pay within the said period, then the amount shall be deemed equivalent to a forbearance of credit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> In such a case, the rate of interest shall be 6% <i>per annum</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the assailed October 17, 2007 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
