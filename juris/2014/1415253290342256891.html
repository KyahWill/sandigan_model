Sidayen, Warden Romeo Jacaban, SPO4 Cirilo Lagmay and Col. Theresa Ann B. Cid.<br><br>The prosecution established that at around 7:00 a.m. on 9 March 1999, JO2 Reynaldo Gamboa (JO2 Gamboa), JO1 Juan Bacolor, Jr. (JO1 Bacolor) and JO2 Marlon Niturada (JO2 Niturada) were inside the nipa hut searching area near the main gate of the district jail. JO2 Gamboa summoned inmate Dionisio Badua (Badua). JO2 Gamboa gave Badua the keys to the prison cells and instructed the latter to open all the cells for the routine headcount.<br><br>Julius Chan (Chan) went to the nipa hut to ask JO2 Gamboa regarding the time of his hearing scheduled for that day. While JO2 Gamboa and Chan were conversing, the telephone in the administration building rang. JO2 Niturada ran from the nipa hut to the administration building to answer the phone.<br><br>After the phone call, JO2 Niturada proceeded towards the basketball court. On his way there, he turned his head towards the nipa hut and saw Chan place an arm on the shoulder of JO2 Gamboa, who was seated, and shoot the latter with a short firearm. JO2 Gamboa fell.<br><br>Meanwhile, Fieldad and Cornista grappled with JO1 Bacolor for the possession of an armalite. Cornista struck JO1 Bacolor at the back of the head, which caused the latter to fall down. Fieldad, armed with JO2 Gamboa’s gun, shot JO1 Bacolor twice. Florante Leal (Leal) took the armalite from JO1 Bacolor and shot at JO2 Niturada. JO2 Niturada returned fire with his .38 caliber handgun.<br><br>Cornista opened the main gate with keys taken from JO2 Gamboa. Twelve inmates went out the main gate. After seeing the inmates run out, Badua padlocked the main gate and returned to his cell.<br><br>Once outside the jail compound, Fieldad, Leal, Cornista, and Pimentel boarded a parked Tamaraw jeep with plate number CDY-255 belonging to Benjamin Bauzon, without the latter’s knowledge and consent. They picked up Federico Delim (Delim) and Chan along the way. Before they reached Asingan, Pangasinan, the group alighted from the Tamaraw jeep and transferred to a Mazda pick-up truck. When they reached San Miguel, Tarlac, the Mazda pick-up truck turned turtle. The group abandoned the vehicle and ran towards a cane field. Police authorities surrounded the cane field and arrested appellants and their companions.<br><br>Dr. Constante Parayno conducted an autopsy on the body of JO1 Bacolor, and concluded that the death was caused by shock and hemorrhage due to gunshot wound of the right lung. Dr. Parayno also testified that based on the injuries sustained by JO1 Bacolor, it was possible that the shooting was preceded by a fight between the shooter and the victim.<br><br>Dr. Ramon Gonzales, Jr. conducted an autopsy on the body of JO2 Gamboa, and concluded that the death was caused by cardiac tamponade due to the gunshot wound that damaged the heart.<br><br><center><b><i>Versions of Appellants</i></b></center><br>Appellants denied any criminal liability.<br><br><i>Fieldad’s Testimony</i><br><br>At around 6:00 in the morning on 9 March 1999, JO2 Gamboa brought Fieldad out of his cell and ordered him to clean the administrative offices. After cleaning the offices, he was told to fix a vehicle parked inside the jail compound. He needed to prop the vehicle on a jack, but he could not find the jack handle. He went back to JO2 Gamboa, who was in the nipa hut with JO2 Niturada and JO1 Bacolor. JO2 Gamboa told him to look for Badua. When he came back with Badua, JO2 Gamboa handed Badua the key of the jail compound. Badua went out of the compound, while Fieldad continued to look for the jack handle.<br><br>While JO2 Niturada talked to him regarding the vehicle, Fieldad noticed Elmo Mejia (Mejia) and the other inmates playing basketball. The ball rolled towards the nipa hut and Mejia went to retrieve it.<br><br>Then Fieldad heard gunshots from the direction of the nipa hut. JO2 Niturada got his gun and fired towards the nipa hut. Fieldad got nervous and took cover in the outpost. He peeped through the windows and saw Mejia pointing a firearm toward JO2 Niturada. He hid again when he heard the exchange of fire between Mejia and JO2 Niturada. He went out of the outpost when he heard people calling for help to push the parked vehicle. The vehicle did not start, and the people pushing it dispersed. Intending to return to his cell, he followed JO2 Niturada, who was proceeding towards the main building. However, JO2 Niturada pointed a gun towards him, so Fieldad ran away and took cover.<br><br>While still inside the jail compound, Leal told Fieldad that he needed the latter to go with him. Fieldad, along with other inmates, left the jail compound. He followed Leal to a Tamaraw jeep parked outside. Leal pointed a long firearm toward Fieldad, and ordered the latter to drive the vehicle. Frightened, Fieldad drove the vehicle. On their way, they picked up Delim and Chan.<br><br><i>Pimentel’s Testimony</i><br><br>At around 7:30 in the morning of 9 March 1999, Pimentel was allowed to go out of his cell. He proceeded to the basketball court for the headcount. He heard two or three gunshots, but did not immediately mind it because he was used to the guards firing their guns in the morning. When he saw Leal with an armalite, running after and shooting at JO2 Niturada, Pimentel ran to a house outside the jail compound. He was afraid to go back to his cell because of the exchange of fire. Inmates were running in different directions.<br><br>Leal arrived at the place where Pimentel was hiding, and motioned to the latter by pointing his armalite downward several times. Pimentel approached Leal, who ordered him to remove the stone blocking the tire of the jeep parked near the house. Pimentel obliged. Pimentel boarded the jeep because Leal told him at gun point to do so. Fieldad drove the jeep. He did not notice who their other companions were. Along the way, they passed a parked vehicle. Leal ordered everyone to alight from the jeep, and to board the other vehicle. The vehicle turned turtle in Tarlac.<br><br><i>Cornista’s Testimony</i><br><br>Cornista was 17 years old on 9 March 1999. Between 6:00 and 6:45 that morning, he was cleaning the jail compound. He was shocked and confused when he heard three rapid gunfires followed by consecutive gunfires coming from the direction of the nipa hut. JO2 Gamboa, JO1 Bacolor, Leal and Mejia were at the nipa hut. Leal was chasing JO2 Niturada, both of them armed. Then he saw the jail guards lying down. Out of fear, he ran towards the already opened main gate.<br><br>Cornista hid in a Tamaraw jeep parked behind the jail compound. Then he saw Leal, Fieldad and Pimentel board the jeep. He tried to alight but Leal threatened to shoot him if he did. Fieldad drove the Tamaraw jeep. Delim flagged the jeep down and boarded. Chan also joined them along the way. Upon seeing a parked Mazda pick up, Leal ordered Fieldad to stop the jeep and the inmates to transfer to the other vehicle. Fieldad also drove the Mazda pick up until it turned turtle in Tarlac.<br><br><center><b><u>The Ruling of the Trial Court</u></b><br></center><br>The dispositive portion of the trial court’s Joint Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:<br><ol><li>In Criminal Case No. U-10053, accused Julius Chan, Charlie Fieldad and Ryan Cornista are declared GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of MURDER and each is sentenced to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA.

U-10053 and U-10054, taking into account the privileged mitigating circumstance of minority. The dispositive portion reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Joint Decision of the trial court is AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATION as to the penalties of imprisonment imposed on Ryan Cornista in Criminal Case Nos. U-10053 and U-10054. Accordingly the penalties of<i> reclusion perpetua</i> imposed on him are reduced to eight (8) years and one (1) day of <i>prision mayor </i>as minimum to fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day of <i>reclusion temporal,</i> as maximum, per each information.<br><br>IT IS SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The appellate court&nbsp; held that “it is manifest that Cornista acted with discernment, being able to distinguish between right and wrong and knowing fully well the consequences of his acts.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The Court of Appeals enumerated the following acts of Cornista that clearly establish discernment:<br><br><blockquote>x x x. His act of grappling for possession of an armalite with Bacolor and hitting the latter’s head clearly demonstrated his discernment. He took advantage of the situation where Fieldad was also grappling with JO1 Bacolor by striking the head of JO1 Bacolor which he obviously knew would weaken the latter’s defenses. Moreover, his act of getting the keys from JO2 Gamboa which he used in opening the main gate clearly demonstrates the idea of escape and thus established discernment on his part. Cornista, having acted with discernment may not be excused from criminal liability.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></blockquote><br>Fieldad, Cornista and Pimentel appealed from the Court of Appeals’ decision. In the interim, Cornista filed a Motion to Withdraw Appeal<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> dated 15 June 2011, which the Court granted in a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> dated 15 August 2011. The case became final and executory as to Cornista on 5 October 2011.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The instant appeal thus pertains to Fieldad and Pimentel only.<br><br>Appellants and appellee adopted their respective briefs<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> filed before the Court of Appeals as their supplemental briefs in this case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>The Court’s Ruling</u></b><br></center><br>The appeal is unmeritorious.<br><br><i><center><b>Nature of the Killings</b><br></center></i><br>Fieldad argues that there can be no treachery since “the jail guards were all issued with firearms to protect themselves from danger and to maintain peace and order within the compound.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> This argument is untenable.<br><br>There is treachery when the offender commits any of the crimes against the person, employing means, methods, or forms in the execution thereof which tend directly and specially to insure its execution, without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might take.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>In <i>People v. Escote, Jr.,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> where an armed off-duty police officer was killed, we held:<br><br><blockquote>x x x. There is treachery when the following essential elements are present, viz: (a) at the time of the attack, the victim was not in a position to defend himself; and (b) the accused consciously and deliberately adopted the particular means, method or form of attack employed by him. The essence of treachery is the sudden and unexpected attack by an aggressor on the unsuspecting victim, depriving the latter of any chance to defend himself and thereby ensuring its commission withour risk of himself. <b>Treachery may also be appreciated even if the victim was warned of the danger to his life where he was defenseless and unable to flee at the time of the infliction of the <i>coup de grace</i></b>. In the case at bar, the victim suffered six wounds, one on the mouth, another on the right ear, one on the shoulder, another on the right breast, one on the upper right cornea of the sternum and one above the right iliac crest. <u>Juan and Victor were armed with handguns. They first disarmed SPO1 Manio, Jr. and then shot him even as he pleaded for dear life. When the victim was shot, he was defenseless. He was shot at close range, thus insuring his death.</u><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> (Boldfacing and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>In the case of <i>People v. Tabaco,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> treachery was appreciated in the killing of three peace officers, one of whom was armed and assigned to maintain the peace and order. They were attending an event where many armed peace officers were present to maintain peace and order. In that case, the victims were completely taken by surprise and had no means of defending themselves against the sudden attack.<br><br>In the instant case, despite being armed, the jail officers were not afforded any chance of defending themselves. Without warning, Fieldad and his cohorts disabled the defenses of the jail officers. Chan held the shoulder of JO2 Gamboa as he shot the latter. Meanwhile, Fieldad teamed-up with Cornista to divest JO1 Bacolor of his armalite, and to knock him down. Then Fieldad took JO2 Gamboa’s gun and shot JO1 Bacolor.<br><br><i><b><center>Fieldad’s Identity was Established<br></center></b></i><br>According to Fieldad, since JO2 Niturada did not identify him as a participant in the killings of JO1 Bacolor and JO2 Gamboa, his identity and complicity in the killings were not established. However, contrary to his contention, Fieldad’s identity in Criminal Case Nos. U-10053 and U-10054 was proven by the prosecution.
