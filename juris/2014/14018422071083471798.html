				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Before this Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 filed by Narra Nickel and Mining Development Corp. (Narra), Tesoro Mining and Development, Inc. (Tesoro), and McArthur Mining Inc. (McArthur), which seeks to reverse the October 1, 2010 Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and the February 15, 2011 Resolution of the Court of Appeals (CA).<br><br><center><b>The Facts</b></center><br>Sometime in December 2006, respondent Redmont Consolidated Mines Corp. (Redmont), a domestic corporation organized and existing under Philippine laws, took interest in mining and exploring certain areas of the province of Palawan.&nbsp; After inquiring with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), it learned that the areas where it wanted to undertake exploration and mining activities where already covered by Mineral Production Sharing Agreement (MPSA) applications of petitioners Narra, Tesoro and McArthur.<br><br>Petitioner McArthur, through its predecessor-in-interest Sara Marie Mining, Inc. (SMMI), filed an application for an MPSA and Exploration Permit (EP) with the Mines and Geo-Sciences Bureau (MGB), Region IV-B, Office of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR).&nbsp; Subsequently, SMMI was issued MPSA-AMA-IVB-153 covering an area of over 1,782 hectares in Barangay Sumbiling, Municipality of Bataraza, Province of Palawan and EPA-IVB-44 which includes an area of 3,720 hectares in Barangay Malatagao, Bataraza, Palawan.&nbsp; The MPSA and EP were then transferred to Madridejos Mining Corporation (MMC) and, on November 6, 2006, assigned to petitioner McArthur.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Petitioner Narra acquired its MPSA from Alpha Resources and Development Corporation and Patricia Louise Mining &amp; Development Corporation (PLMDC) which previously filed an application for an MPSA with the MGB, Region IV-B, DENR on January 6, 1992.&nbsp; Through the said application, the DENR issued MPSA-IV-1-12 covering an area of 3.277 hectares in barangays Calategas and San Isidro, Municipality of Narra, Palawan.&nbsp; Subsequently, PLMDC conveyed, transferred and/or assigned its rights and interests over the MPSA application in favor of Narra.<br><br>Another MPSA application of SMMI was filed with the DENR Region IV-B, labeled as MPSA-AMA-IVB-154 (formerly EPA-IVB-47) over 3,402 hectares in Barangays Malinao and Princesa Urduja, Municipality of Narra, Province of Palawan.&nbsp; SMMI subsequently conveyed, transferred and assigned its rights and interest over the said MPSA application to Tesoro.<br><br>On January 2, 2007, Redmont filed before the Panel of Arbitrators (POA) of the DENR three (3) separate petitions for the denial of petitioners’ applications for MPSA designated as AMA-IVB-153, AMA-IVB-154 and MPSA IV-1-12.<br><br>In the petitions, Redmont alleged that at least 60% of the capital stock of McArthur, Tesoro and Narra are owned and controlled by MBMI Resources, Inc. (MBMI), a 100% Canadian corporation.&nbsp; Redmont reasoned that since MBMI is a considerable stockholder of petitioners, it was the driving force behind petitioners’ filing of the MPSAs over the areas covered by applications since it knows that it can only participate in mining activities through corporations which are deemed Filipino citizens.&nbsp; Redmont argued that given that petitioners’ capital stocks were mostly owned by MBMI, they were likewise disqualified from engaging in mining activities through MPSAs, which are reserved only for Filipino citizens.<br><br>In their Answers, petitioners averred that they were qualified persons under Section 3(aq) of Republic Act No. (RA) 7942 or the <i>Philippine Mining Act of 1995</i> which provided:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 3 Definition of Terms. As used in and for purposes of this Act, the following terms, whether in singular or plural, shall mean:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(aq) “Qualified person” means any citizen of the Philippines with capacity to contract, or a corporation, partnership, association, or cooperative organized or authorized for the purpose of engaging in mining, with technical and financial capability to undertake mineral resources development and duly registered in accordance with law at least sixty per cent (60%) of the capital of which is owned by citizens of the Philippines: Provided, That a legally organized foreign-owned corporation shall be deemed a qualified person for purposes of granting an exploration permit, financial or technical assistance agreement or mineral processing permit.</blockquote><br>Additionally, they stated that their nationality as applicants is immaterial because they also applied for Financial or Technical Assistance Agreements (FTAA) denominated as AFTA-IVB-09 for McArthur, AFTA-IVB-08 for Tesoro and AFTA-IVB-07 for Narra, which are granted to foreign-owned corporations.&nbsp; Nevertheless, <b>they claimed that the issue on nationality should not be raised since McArthur, Tesoro and Narra are in fact Philippine Nationals as 60% of their capital is owned by citizens of the Philippines</b>.&nbsp; They asserted that though MBMI owns 40% of the shares of PLMC (which owns 5,997 shares of Narra),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> 40% of the shares of MMC (which owns 5,997 shares of McArthur)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> and 40% of the shares of SLMC (which, in turn, owns 5,997 shares of Tesoro),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> the shares of MBMI will not make it the owner of at least 60% of the capital stock of each of petitioners.&nbsp; <b>They added that the best tool used in determining the nationality of a corporation is the “control test,” embodied in Sec. 3 of RA 7042 or the <i>Foreign Investments Act of 1991</i></b>.&nbsp; They also claimed that the POA of DENR did not have jurisdiction over the issues in Redmont’s petition since they are not enumerated in Sec. 77 of RA 7942.&nbsp; Finally, they stressed that Redmont has no personality to sue them because it has no pending claim or application over the areas applied for by petitioners.<br><br>On December 14, 2007, the POA issued a Resolution disqualifying petitioners from gaining MPSAs. It held:<br><br><blockquote>[I]t is clearly established that respondents are not qualified applicants to engage in mining activities.&nbsp; On the other hand, [Redmont] having filed its own applications for an EPA over the areas earlier covered by the MPSA application of respondents may be considered if and when they are qualified under the law.&nbsp; The violation of the requirements for the issuance and/or grant of permits over mining areas is clearly established thus, there is reason to believe that the cancellation and/or revocation of permits already issued under the premises is in order and open the areas covered to other qualified applicants.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>WHEREFORE, the Panel of Arbitrators finds the Respondents, McArthur Mining Inc., Tesoro Mining and Development, Inc., and Narra Nickel Mining and Development Corp. as, DISQUALIFIED for being considered as Foreign Corporations.&nbsp; Their Mineral Production Sharing Agreement (MPSA) are hereby x x x DECLARED NULL AND VOID.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></blockquote><br>The POA considered petitioners as foreign corporations being “effectively controlled” by MBMI, a 100% Canadian company and declared their MPSAs null and void.&nbsp; In the same Resolution, it gave due course to Redmont’s EPAs.&nbsp; Thereafter, on February 7, 2008, the POA issued an Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> denying the Motion for Reconsideration filed by petitioners.<br><br>Aggrieved by the Resolution and Order of the POA, McArthur and Tesoro filed a joint Notice of Appeal<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> and Memorandum of Appeal<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> with the Mines Adjudication Board (MAB) while Narra separately filed its Notice of Appeal<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> and Memorandum of Appeal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>In their respective memorandum, petitioners emphasized that they are qualified persons under the law.&nbsp; Also, through a letter, they informed the MAB that they had their individual MPSA applications converted to FTAAs.&nbsp; McArthur’s FTAA was denominated as AFTA-IVB-09<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> on May 2007, while Tesoro’s MPSA application was converted to AFTA-IVB-08<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> on May 28, 2007, and Narra’s FTAA was converted to AFTA-IVB-07<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> on March 30, 2006.<br><br>Pending the resolution of the appeal filed by petitioners with the MAB, Redmont filed a Complaint<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), seeking the revocation of the certificates for registration of petitioners on the ground that they are foreign-owned or controlled corporations engaged in mining in violation of Philippine laws. Thereafter, Redmont filed on September 1, 2008 a Manifestation and Motion to Suspend Proceeding before the MAB praying for the suspension of the proceedings on the appeals filed by McArthur, Tesoro and Narra.<br><br>Subsequently, on September 8, 2008, Redmont filed before the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 92 (RTC) a Complaint<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> for injunction with application for issuance of a temporary restraining order (TRO) and/or writ of preliminary injunction, docketed as Civil Case No. 08-63379.&nbsp; Redmont prayed for the deferral of the MAB proceedings pending the resolution of the Complaint before the SEC.<br><br>But before the RTC can resolve Redmont’s Complaint and applications for injunctive reliefs, the MAB issued an Order on September 10, 2008, finding the appeal meritorious.&nbsp; It held:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the Mines Adjudication Board hereby REVERSES and SETS ASIDE the Resolution dated 14 December 2007 of the Panel of Arbitrators of Region IV-B (MIMAROPA) in POA-DENR Case Nos. 2001-01, 2007-02 and 2007-03, and its Order dated 07 February 2008 denying the Motions for Reconsideration of the Appellants.&nbsp; The Petition filed by Redmont Consolidated Mines Corporation on 02 January 2007 is hereby ordered DISMISSED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote><br>Belatedly, on September 16, 2008, the RTC issued an Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> granting Redmont’s application for a TRO and setting the case for hearing the prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction on September 19, 2008.<br><br>Meanwhile, on September 22, 2008, Redmont filed a Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> of the September 10, 2008 Order of the MAB.&nbsp; Subsequently, it filed a Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> on September 29, 2008.<br><br>Before the MAB could resolve Redmont’s Motion for Reconsideration and Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration, Redmont filed before the RTC a Supplemental Complaint<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> in Civil Case No. 08-63379.<br><br>On October 6, 2008, the RTC issued an Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> granting the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction enjoining the MAB from finally disposing of the appeals of petitioners and from resolving Redmont’s Motion for Reconsideration and Supplement Motion for Reconsideration of the MAB’s September 10, 2008 Resolution.<br><br>On July 1, 2009, however, the MAB issued a second Order denying Redmont’s Motion for Reconsideration and Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration and resolving the appeals filed by petitioners.<br><br>Hence, the petition for review filed by Redmont before the CA, assailing the Orders issued by the MAB.&nbsp; On October 1, 2010, the CA rendered a Decision, the dispositive of which reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Petition is PARTIALLY GRANTED.&nbsp; The assailed Orders, dated September 10, 2008 and July 1, 2009 of the Mining Adjudication Board are reversed and set aside.&nbsp; The findings of the Panel of Arbitrators of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources that respondents McArthur, Tesoro and Narra are foreign corporations is upheld and, therefore, the rejection of their applications for Mineral Product Sharing Agreement should be recommended to the Secretary of the DENR.<br><br>With respect to the applications of respondents McArthur, Tesoro and Narra for Financial or Technical Assistance Agreement (FTAA) or conversion of their MPSA applications to FTAA, the matter for its rejection or approval is left for determination by the Secretary of the DENR and the President of the Republic of the Philippines.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></blockquote><br>In a Resolution dated February 15, 2011, the CA denied the Motion for Reconsideration filed by petitioners.<br><br>After a careful review of the records, the CA found that there was doubt as to the nationality of petitioners when it realized that petitioners had a common major investor, MBMI, a corporation composed of 100% Canadians.&nbsp; Pursuant to the first sentence of paragraph 7 of Department of Justice (DOJ) Opinion No. 020, Series of 2005, adopting the 1967 SEC Rules which implemented the requirement of the Constitution and other laws pertaining to the exploitation of natural resources, the CA used the “grandfather rule” to determine the nationality of petitioners.&nbsp; It provided:<br><br><blockquote>Shares belonging to corporations or partnerships at least 60% of the capital of which is owned by Filipino citizens shall be considered as of Philippine nationality, <b>but if the percentage of Filipino ownership in the corporation or partnership is less than 60%, only the number of shares corresponding to such percentage shall be counted as of Philippine nationality</b>.&nbsp; Thus, if 100,000 shares are registered in the name of a corporation or partnership at least 60% of the capital stock or capital, respectively, of which belong to Filipino citizens, all of the shares shall be recorded as owned by Filipinos.&nbsp; But if less than 60%, or say, 50% of the capital stock or capital of the corporation or partnership, respectively, belongs to Filipino citizens, only 50,000 shares shall be recorded as belonging to aliens.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> (emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>In determining the nationality of petitioners, the CA looked into their corporate structures and their corresponding common shareholders.&nbsp; Using the grandfather rule, the CA discovered that MBMI in effect owned majority of the common stocks of the petitioners as well as at least 60% equity interest of other majority shareholders of petitioners through joint venture agreements.&nbsp; The CA found that through a “web of corporate layering, it is clear that <u>one common controlling investor</u> in all mining corporations involved x x x is <u>MBMI</u>.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, it concluded that petitioners McArthur, Tesoro and Narra are also in partnership with, or privies-in-interest of, MBMI.<br><br>Furthermore, the CA viewed the conversion of the MPSA applications of petitioners into FTAA applications suspicious in nature and, as a consequence, it recommended the rejection of petitioners’ MPSA applications by the Secretary of the DENR.<br><br>With regard to the settlement of disputes over rights to mining areas, the CA pointed out that the POA has jurisdiction over them and that it also has the power to determine the of nationality of petitioners as a prerequisite of the Constitution prior the conferring of rights to “co-production, joint venture or production-sharing agreements” of the state to mining rights.&nbsp; However, it also stated that the POA’s jurisdiction is limited only to the resolution of the dispute and not on the approval or rejection of the MPSAs.&nbsp; It stipulated that only the Secretary of the DENR is vested with the power to approve or reject applications for MPSA.<br><br>Finally, the CA upheld the findings of the POA in its December 14, 2007 Resolution which considered petitioners McArthur, Tesoro and Narra as foreign corporations.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the CA determined that the POA’s declaration that the MPSAs of McArthur, Tesoro and Narra are void is highly improper.<br><br>While the petition was pending with the CA, Redmont filed with the Office of the President (OP) a petition dated May 7, 2010 seeking the cancellation of petitioners’ FTAAs.&nbsp; The OP rendered a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> on April 6, 2011, wherein it canceled and revoked petitioners’ FTAAs for violating and circumventing the “Constitution x x x[,] the Small Scale Mining Law and Environmental Compliance Certificate as well as Sections 3 and 8 of the Foreign Investment Act and E.O. 584.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; The OP, in affirming the cancellation of the issued FTAAs, agreed with Redmont stating that petitioners committed violations against the abovementioned laws and failed to submit evidence to negate them.&nbsp; The Decision further quoted the December 14, 2007 Order of the POA focusing on the alleged misrepresentation and claims made by petitioners of being domestic or Filipino corporations and the admitted continued mining operation of PMDC using their locally secured Small Scale Mining Permit inside the area earlier applied for an MPSA application which was eventually transferred to Narra.&nbsp; It also agreed with the POA’s estimation that the filing of the FTAA applications by petitioners is a clear admission that they are “not capable of conducting a large scale mining operation and that they need the financial and technical assistance of a foreign entity in their operation, that is why they sought the participation of MBMI Resources, Inc.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; The Decision further quoted:<br><br><blockquote>The filing of the FTAA application on June 15, 2007, during the pendency of the case only demonstrate the violations and lack of qualification of the respondent corporations to engage in mining.&nbsp; The filing of the FTAA application conversion which is allowed foreign corporation of the earlier MPSA is an admission that indeed the respondent is not Filipino but rather of foreign nationality who is disqualified under the laws.&nbsp; Corporate documents of MBMI Resources, Inc. furnished its stockholders in their head office in Canada suggest that they are conducting operation only through their local counterparts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></blockquote><br>The Motion for Reconsideration of the Decision was further denied by the OP in a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> dated July 6, 2011.&nbsp; Petitioners then filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari of the OP’s Decision and Resolution with the CA, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 120409.&nbsp; In the CA Decision dated February 29, 2012, the CA affirmed the Decision and Resolution of the OP.&nbsp; Thereafter, petitioners appealed the same CA decision to this Court which is now pending with a different division.<br><br>Thus, the instant petition for review against the October 1, 2010 Decision of the CA.&nbsp; Petitioners put forth the following errors of the CA:<br><br><blockquote><center>I.<br></center><br>The Court of Appeals erred when it did not dismiss the case for mootness despite the fact that the subject matter of the controversy, the MPSA Applications, have already been converted into FTAA applications and that the same have already been granted.<br><br><center>II.<br></center><br>The Court of Appeals erred when it did not dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction considering that the Panel of Arbitrators has no jurisdiction to determine the nationality of Narra, Tesoro and McArthur.<br><br><center>III.<br></center><br>The Court of Appeals erred when it did not dismiss the case on account of Redmont’s willful forum shopping.<br><br><center>IV.<br></center><br>The Court of Appeals’ ruling that Narra, Tesoro and McArthur are foreign corporations based on the “Grandfather Rule” is contrary to law, particularly the express mandate of the Foreign Investments Act of 1991, as amended, and the FIA Rules.<br><br><center>V.<br></center><br>The Court of Appeals erred when it applied the exceptions to the <i>res inter alios acta</i> rule.<br><br><center>VI.<br></center><br>The Court of Appeals erred when it concluded that the conversion of the MPSA Applications into FTAA Applications were of “suspicious nature” as the same is based on mere conjectures and surmises without any shred of evidence to show the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></blockquote><br>We find the petition to be without merit.<br><br><b>This case not moot and academic</b><br><br>The claim of petitioners that the CA erred in not rendering the instant case as moot is without merit.<br><br>Basically, a case is said to be moot and/or academic when it “ceases to present a justiciable controversy by virtue of supervening events, so that a declaration thereon would be of no practical use or value.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, the courts “generally decline jurisdiction over the case or dismiss it on the ground of mootness.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>The “mootness” principle, however, does accept certain exceptions and the mere raising of an issue of “mootness” will not deter the courts from trying a case when there is a valid reason to do so.&nbsp; In <i>David v. Macapagal-Arroyo (David)</i>, the Court provided four instances where courts can decide an otherwise moot case, thus:<br><br><blockquote>1.) There is a grave violation of the Constitution;<br>2.) The exceptional character of the situation and paramount public interest is involved;<br>3.) When constitutional issue raised requires formulation of controlling principles to guide the bench, the bar, and the public; and<br>4.) The case is capable of repetition yet evading review.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></blockquote><br>All of the exceptions stated above are present in the instant case.&nbsp; We of this Court note that a grave violation of the Constitution, specifically Section 2 of Article XII, is being committed by a foreign corporation right under our country’s nose through a myriad of corporate layering under different, allegedly, Filipino corporations.&nbsp; The intricate corporate layering utilized by the Canadian company, MBMI, is of exceptional character and involves paramount public interest since it undeniably affects the exploitation of our Country’s natural resources.&nbsp; The corresponding actions of petitioners during the lifetime and existence of the instant case raise questions as what principle is to be applied to cases with similar issues.&nbsp; No definite ruling on such principle has been pronounced by the Court; hence, the disposition of the issues or errors in the instant case will serve as a guide “to the bench, the bar and the public.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; Finally, the instant case is capable of repetition yet evading review, since the Canadian company, MBMI, can keep on utilizing dummy Filipino corporations through various schemes of corporate layering and conversion of applications to skirt the constitutional prohibition against foreign mining in Philippine soil.<br><br><b>Conversion of MPSA applications to FTAA applications</b><br><br>We shall discuss the first error in conjunction with the sixth error presented by petitioners since both involve the conversion of MPSA applications to FTAA applications.&nbsp; Petitioners propound that the CA erred in ruling against them since the questioned MPSA applications were already converted into FTAA applications; thus, the issue on the prohibition relating to MPSA applications of foreign mining corporations is academic.&nbsp; Also, petitioners would want us to correct the CA’s finding which deemed the aforementioned conversions of applications as suspicious in nature, since it is based on mere conjectures and surmises and not supported with evidence.<br><br>We disagree.<br><br>The CA’s analysis of the actions of petitioners after the case was filed against them by respondent is on point.&nbsp; The changing of applications by petitioners from one type to another just because a case was filed against them, in truth, would raise not a few sceptics’ eyebrows.&nbsp; What is the reason for such conversion?&nbsp; Did the said conversion not stem from the case challenging their citizenship and to have the case dismissed against them for being “moot”?&nbsp; It is quite obvious that it is petitioners’ strategy to have the case dismissed against them for being “moot.”<br><br>Consider the history of this case and how petitioners responded to every action done by the court or appropriate government agency: on January 2, 2007, Redmont filed three separate petitions for denial of the MPSA applications of petitioners before the POA.&nbsp; On June 15, 2007, petitioners filed a conversion of their MPSA applications to FTAAs.&nbsp; The POA, in its December 14, 2007 Resolution, observed this suspect change of applications while the case was pending before it and held:<br><br><blockquote>The filing of the Financial or Technical Assistance Agreement application is a clear admission that the respondents are not capable of conducting a large scale mining operation and that they need the financial and technical assistance of a foreign entity in their operation that is why they sought the participation of MBMI Resources, Inc.&nbsp; The participation of MBMI in the corporation only proves the fact that it is the Canadian company that will provide the finances and the resources to operate the mining areas for the greater benefit and interest of the same and not the Filipino stockholders who only have a less substantial financial stake in the corporation.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>x x x The filing of the FTAA application on <b>June 15, 2007, during the pendency of the case</b> only demonstrate the violations and lack of qualification of the respondent corporations to engage in mining.&nbsp; <b>The filing of the FTAA application conversion which is allowed foreign corporation of the earlier MPSA is an admission that indeed the respondent is not Filipino but rather of foreign nationality who is disqualified under the laws</b>. Corporate documents of MBMI Resources, Inc. furnished its stockholders in their head office in Canada suggest that they are conducting operation only through their local counterparts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></blockquote><br>On October 1, 2010, the CA rendered a Decision which partially granted the petition, reversing and setting aside the September 10, 2008 and July 1, 2009 Orders of the MAB.&nbsp; In the said Decision, the CA upheld the findings of the POA of the DENR that the herein petitioners are in fact foreign corporations thus a recommendation of the rejection of their MPSA applications were recommended to the Secretary of the DENR.&nbsp; With respect to the FTAA applications or conversion of the MPSA applications to FTAAs, the CA deferred the matter for the determination of the Secretary of the DENR and the President of the Republic of the Philippines.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>In their Motion for Reconsideration dated October 26, 2010, petitioners prayed for the dismissal of the petition asserting that on <b>April 5, 2010</b>, then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo signed and issued in their favor FTAA No. 05-2010-IVB, which rendered the petition moot and academic.&nbsp; However, the CA, in a Resolution dated February 15, 2011 denied their motion for being a mere “rehash of their claims and defenses.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp; Standing firm on its Decision, the CA affirmed the ruling that petitioners are, in fact, foreign corporations.&nbsp; On April 5, 2011, petitioners elevated the case to us via a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45, questioning the Decision of the CA.&nbsp; Interestingly, the OP rendered a Decision dated April 6, 2011, a day after this petition for review was filed, cancelling and revoking the FTAAs, quoting the Order of the POA and stating that petitioners are foreign corporations since they needed the financial strength of MBMI, Inc. in order to conduct large scale mining operations.&nbsp; The OP Decision also based the cancellation on the misrepresentation of facts and the violation of the “Small Scale Mining Law and Environmental Compliance Certificate as well as Sections 3 and 8 of the Foreign Investment Act and E.O. 584.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; On July 6, 2011, the OP issued a Resolution, denying the Motion for Reconsideration filed by the petitioners.<br><br>Respondent Redmont, in its Comment dated October 10, 2011, made known to the Court the fact of the OP’s Decision and Resolution.&nbsp; In their Reply, petitioners chose to ignore the OP Decision and continued to reuse their old arguments claiming that they were granted FTAAs and, thus, the case was moot.&nbsp; Petitioners filed a Manifestation and Submission dated October 19, 2012,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> wherein they asserted that the present petition is moot since, in a remarkable turn of events, MBMI was able to sell/assign all its shares/interest in the “holding companies” to DMCI Mining Corporation (DMCI), a Filipino corporation and, in effect, making their respective corporations fully-Filipino owned.<br><br>Again, it is quite evident that petitioners have been trying to have this case dismissed for being “moot.”&nbsp; Their final act, wherein MBMI was able to allegedly sell/assign <b>all</b> its shares and interest in the petitioner “holding companies” to DMCI, only proves that they were in fact not Filipino corporations from the start.&nbsp; The recent divesting of interest by MBMI will not change the stand of this Court with respect to the nationality of petitioners prior the suspicious change in their corporate structures.&nbsp; The new documents filed by petitioners are factual evidence that this Court has no power to verify.<br><br>The only thing clear and proved in this Court is the fact that the OP declared that petitioner corporations have violated several mining laws and made misrepresentations and falsehood in their applications for FTAA which lead to the revocation of the said FTAAs, demonstrating that petitioners are not beyond going against or around the law using shifty actions and strategies.&nbsp; Thus, in this instance, we can say that their claim of mootness is moot in itself because their defense of conversion of MPSAs to FTAAs has been discredited by the OP Decision.<br><br><b>Grandfather test<br></b><br>The main issue in this case is centered on the issue of petitioners’ nationality, whether Filipino or foreign.&nbsp; In their previous petitions, they had been adamant in insisting that they were Filipino corporations, until they submitted their Manifestation and Submission dated October 19, 2012 where they stated the alleged change of corporate ownership to reflect their Filipino ownership.&nbsp; Thus, there is a need to determine the nationality of petitioner corporations.<br><br>Basically, there are two acknowledged tests in determining the nationality of a corporation: the control test and the grandfather rule.&nbsp; Paragraph 7 of DOJ Opinion No. 020, Series of 2005, adopting the 1967 SEC Rules which implemented the requirement of the Constitution and other laws pertaining to the controlling interests in enterprises engaged in the exploitation of natural resources owned by Filipino citizens, provides:<br><br><blockquote>Shares belonging to corporations or partnerships at least 60% of the capital of which is owned by Filipino citizens shall be considered as of Philippine nationality, but if the percentage of Filipino ownership in the corporation or partnership is less than 60%, only the number of shares corresponding to such percentage shall be counted as of Philippine nationality.&nbsp; Thus, if 100,000 shares are registered in the name of a corporation or partnership at least 60% of the capital stock or capital, respectively, of which belong to Filipino citizens, all of the shares shall be recorded as owned by Filipinos.&nbsp; But if less than 60%, or say, 50% of the capital stock or capital of the corporation or partnership, respectively, belongs to Filipino citizens, only 50,000 shares shall be counted as owned by Filipinos and the other 50,000 shall be recorded as belonging to aliens.</blockquote><br>The first part of paragraph 7, DOJ Opinion No. 020, stating “shares belonging to corporations or partnerships at least 60% of the capital of which is owned by Filipino citizens shall be considered as of Philippine nationality,” pertains to the control test or the liberal rule.&nbsp; On the other hand, the second part of the DOJ Opinion which provides, “if the percentage of the Filipino ownership in the corporation or partnership is less than 60%, only the number of shares corresponding to such percentage shall be counted as Philippine nationality,” pertains to the stricter, more stringent grandfather rule.<br><br>Prior to this recent change of events, petitioners were constant in advocating the application of the “control test” under RA 7042, as amended by RA 8179, otherwise known as the <i>Foreign Investments Act</i> (FIA), rather than using the stricter grandfather rule.&nbsp; The pertinent provision under Sec. 3 of the FIA provides:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 3. <i>Definitions</i>. - As used in this Act:<br><br>a.)&nbsp; The term Philippine national shall mean a citizen of the Philippines; or a domestic partnership or association wholly owned by the citizens of the Philippines; a corporation organized under the laws of the Philippines of which at least sixty percent (60%) of the capital stock outstanding and entitled to vote is wholly owned by Filipinos or a trustee of funds for pension or other employee retirement or separation benefits, where the trustee is a Philippine national and at least sixty percent (60%) of the fund will accrue to the benefit of Philippine nationals: Provided, <b>That were a corporation and its non-Filipino stockholders own stocks in a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) registered enterprise, at least sixty percent (60%) of the capital stock outstanding and entitled to vote of each of both corporations must be owned and held by citizens of the Philippines and at least sixty percent (60%) of the members of the Board of Directors, in order that the corporation shall be considered a Philippine national</b>. (emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The grandfather rule, petitioners reasoned, has no leg to stand on in the instant case since the definition of a “Philippine National” under Sec. 3 of the FIA does not provide for it.&nbsp; They further claim that the grandfather rule “has been abandoned and is no longer the applicable rule.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>&nbsp; They also opined that the last portion of Sec. 3 of the FIA admits the application of a “corporate layering” scheme of corporations.&nbsp; Petitioners claim that the clear and unambiguous wordings of the statute preclude the court from construing it and prevent the court’s use of discretion in applying the law. They said that the plain, literal meaning of the statute meant the application of the control test is obligatory.<br><br>We disagree.&nbsp; “Corporate layering” is admittedly allowed by the FIA; but if it is used to circumvent the Constitution and pertinent laws, then it becomes illegal.&nbsp; Further, the pronouncement of petitioners that the grandfather rule has already been abandoned must be discredited for lack of basis.<br><br>Art. XII, Sec. 2 of the Constitution provides:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 2.&nbsp; All lands of the public domain, waters, minerals, coal, petroleum and other mineral oils, all forces of potential energy, fisheries, forests or timber, wildlife, flora and fauna, and other natural resources are owned by the State.&nbsp; With the exception of agricultural lands, all other natural resources shall not be alienated.&nbsp; The exploration, development, and utilization of natural resources shall be under the full control and supervision of the State.&nbsp; <b>The State may directly undertake such activities, or it may enter into co-production, joint venture or production-sharing agreements with Filipino citizens, or corporations or associations at least sixty per centum of whose capital is owned by such citizens.</b>&nbsp; Such agreements may be for a period not exceeding twenty-five years, renewable for not more than twenty-five years, and under such terms and conditions as may be provided by law.<br>&nbsp;<br>x x x x<br><br>The President may enter into agreements with Foreign-owned corporations involving either technical or financial assistance for large-scale exploration, development, and utilization of minerals, petroleum, and other mineral oils according to the general terms and conditions provided by law, based on real contributions to the economic growth and general welfare of the country. In such agreements, the State shall promote the development and use of local scientific and technical resources. (emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The emphasized portion of Sec. 2 which focuses on the State entering into different types of agreements for the exploration, development, and utilization of natural resources with entities who are deemed Filipino due to 60 percent ownership of capital is pertinent to this case, since the issues are centered on the utilization of our country’s natural resources or specifically, mining.&nbsp; Thus, there is a need to ascertain the nationality of petitioners since, as the Constitution so provides, such agreements are only allowed corporations or associations “at least 60 percent of such capital is owned by such citizens.” The deliberations in the Records of the 1986 Constitutional Commission shed light on how a citizenship of a corporation will be determined:<br><br><blockquote><b>Mr. BENNAGEN:</b> Did I hear right that the Chairman’s interpretation of an independent national economy is freedom from undue foreign control?&nbsp; What is the meaning of undue foreign control?<br><br><b>MR.

XII of the Constitution on National Economy and Patrimony, Sec. 3 of the FIA will have no place of application.&nbsp; As decreed by the honorable framers of our Constitution, the grandfather rule prevails and must be applied.<br><br>Likewise, paragraph 7, DOJ Opinion No. 020, Series of 2005 provides:<br><br><blockquote>The above-quoted SEC Rules provide for the manner of calculating the Filipino interest in a corporation for purposes, among others, of determining compliance with nationality requirements (the ‘Investee Corporation’).&nbsp; Such manner of computation is necessary since the shares in the Investee Corporation may be owned both by individual stockholders (‘Investing Individuals’) and by corporations and partnerships (‘Investing Corporation’).&nbsp; The said rules thus provide for the determination of nationality depending on the ownership of the Investee Corporation and, in certain instances, the Investing Corporation.<br><br>Under the above-quoted SEC Rules, there are two cases in determining the nationality of the Investee Corporation.&nbsp; The first case is the ‘liberal rule’, later coined by the SEC as the Control Test in its 30 May 1990 Opinion, and pertains to the portion in said Paragraph 7 of the 1967 SEC Rules which states, ‘(s)hares belonging to corporations or partnerships at least 60% of the capital of which is owned by Filipino citizens shall be considered as of Philippine nationality.’&nbsp; Under the liberal Control Test, there is no need to further trace the ownership of the 60% (or more) Filipino stockholdings of the Investing Corporation since a corporation which is at least 60% Filipino-owned is considered as Filipino.<br><br>The second case is the Strict Rule or the Grandfather Rule Proper and pertains to the portion in said Paragraph 7 of the 1967 SEC Rules which states, “but if the percentage of Filipino ownership in the corporation or partnership is less than 60%, only the number of shares corresponding to such percentage shall be counted as of Philippine nationality.”&nbsp; Under the Strict Rule or Grandfather Rule Proper, the combined totals in the Investing Corporation and the Investee Corporation must be traced (i.e., “grandfathered”) to determine the total percentage of Filipino ownership.<br><br>Moreover, the ultimate Filipino ownership of the shares must first be traced to the level of the Investing Corporation and added to the shares directly owned in the Investee Corporation x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>In other words, based on the said SEC Rule and DOJ Opinion, the <b>Grandfather Rule or the second part of the SEC Rule applies only when the 60-40 Filipino-foreign equity ownership is in doubt</b> (i.e., in cases where the joint venture corporation with Filipino and foreign stockholders with less than 60% Filipino stockholdings [or 59%] invests in other joint venture corporation which is either 60-40% Filipino-alien or the 59% less Filipino).&nbsp; <b>Stated differently, where the 60-40 Filipino-foreign equity ownership is not in doubt, the Grandfather Rule will not apply</b>. (emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>After a scrutiny of the evidence extant on record, the Court finds that this case calls for the application of the grandfather rule since, as ruled by the POA and affirmed by the OP, doubt prevails and persists in the corporate ownership of petitioners.&nbsp; Also, as found by the CA, doubt is present in the 60-40 Filipino equity ownership of petitioners Narra, McArthur and Tesoro, since their common investor, the 100% Canadian corporation––MBMI, funded them.&nbsp; However, petitioners also claim that there is “doubt” only when the stockholdings of Filipinos are less than 60%.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>The assertion of petitioners that “doubt” only exists when the stockholdings are less than 60% fails to convince this Court.&nbsp; DOJ Opinion No. 20, which petitioners quoted in their petition, only made an example of an instance where “doubt” as to the ownership of the corporation exists.&nbsp; It would be ludicrous to limit the application of the said word only to the instances where the stockholdings of non-Filipino stockholders are more than 40% of the total stockholdings in a corporation.&nbsp; The corporations interested in circumventing our laws would clearly strive to have “60% Filipino Ownership” at face value.&nbsp; It would be senseless for these applying corporations to state in their respective articles of incorporation that they have less than 60% Filipino stockholders since the applications will be denied instantly.&nbsp; Thus, various corporate schemes and layerings are utilized to circumvent the application of the Constitution.<br><br>Obviously, the instant case presents a situation which exhibits a scheme employed by stockholders to circumvent the law, creating a cloud of doubt in the Court’s mind.&nbsp; To determine, therefore, the actual participation, direct or indirect, of MBMI, the grandfather rule must be used.<br><br><b><u>McArthur Mining, Inc.</u></b><br><br>To establish the actual ownership, interest or participation of MBMI in each of petitioners’ corporate structure, they have to be “grandfathered.”<br><br>As previously discussed, McArthur acquired its MPSA application from MMC, which acquired its application from SMMI.&nbsp; McArthur has a capital stock of ten million pesos (PhP 10,000,000) divided into 10,000 common shares at one thousand pesos (PhP 1,000) per share, subscribed to by the following:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="26%"><div align="CENTER"><b>Name</b></div></td> <td width="17%"><div align="CENTER"><b>Nationality</b></div></td> <td width="17%"><div align="CENTER"><b>Number of <br> Shares</b></div></td> <td width="20%"><div align="CENTER"><b>Amount <br> Subscribed</b></div></td> <td width="20%"><div align="CENTER"><b>Amount Paid</b></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Madridejos Mining Corporation</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">Filipino</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">5,997</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">PhP 5,997,000.00</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">PhP 825,000.00</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><b>MBMI Resources, Inc.</b></div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">Canadian</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">3,998</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">PhP 3,998,000.00</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">PhP 1,878,174.60</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Lauro L.

Such conclusion is derived from grandfathering petitioners’ corporate owners, namely: MMI, SMMI and PLMDC.&nbsp; Going further and adding to the picture, MBMI’s <i>Summary of Significant Accounting Policies</i> statement––regarding the “joint venture” agreements that it entered into with the “Olympic” and “Alpha” groups––involves SMMI, Tesoro, PLMDC and Narra.&nbsp; Noticeably, the ownership of the “layered” corporations boils down to MBMI, Olympic or corporations under the “Alpha” group wherein MBMI has joint venture agreements with, practically exercising majority control over the corporations mentioned.&nbsp; In effect, whether looking at the capital structure or the underlying relationships between and among the corporations, petitioners are NOT Filipino nationals and must be considered foreign since 60% or more of their capital stocks or equity interests are owned by MBMI.<br><br><b>Application of the <i>res inter alios acta</i> rule&nbsp;

<i>Admission by co-partner or agent.</i>- The act or declaration of a partner or agent of the party within the scope of his authority and during the existence of the partnership or agency, may be given in evidence against such party after the partnership or agency is shown by evidence other than such act or declaration itself.&nbsp;

They challenged the conclusion of the CA which pertains to the close characteristics of “partnerships” and “joint venture agreements.”&nbsp; Further, they asserted that before this particular partnership can be formed, it should have been formally reduced into writing since the capital involved is more than three thousand pesos (PhP 3,000).&nbsp; Being that there is no evidence of written agreement to form a partnership between petitioners and MBMI, no partnership was created.<br><br>We disagree.<br><br>A partnership is defined as two or more persons who bind themselves to contribute money, property, or industry to a common fund with the intention of dividing the profits among themselves.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>&nbsp;

thus, joint ventures are deemed “akin” or similar to a partnership.&nbsp; In fact, in joint venture agreements, rules and legal incidents governing partnerships are applied.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, culled from the incidents and records of this case, it can be assumed that the relationships entered between and among petitioners and MBMI are no simple “joint venture agreements.”&nbsp; As a rule, corporations are prohibited from entering into partnership agreements; consequently, corporations enter into joint venture agreements with other corporations or partnerships for certain transactions in order to form “pseudo partnerships.” Obviously, as the intricate web of “ventures” entered into by and among petitioners and MBMI was executed to circumvent the legal prohibition against corporations entering into partnerships, then the relationship created should be deemed as “partnerships,” and the laws on partnership should be applied.&nbsp; Thus, a joint venture agreement between and among corporations may be seen as similar to partnerships since the elements of partnership are present.<br><br>Considering that the relationships found between petitioners and MBMI are considered to be partnerships, then the CA is justified in applying Sec. 29, Rule 130 of the Rules by stating that “by entering into a joint venture, MBMI have a joint interest” with Narra, Tesoro and McArthur.<br><br><b>Panel of Arbitrators’ jurisdiction<br></b><br>We affirm the ruling of the CA in declaring that the POA has jurisdiction over the instant case.&nbsp; The POA has jurisdiction to settle disputes over rights to mining areas which definitely involve the petitions filed by Redmont against petitioners Narra, McArthur and Tesoro.&nbsp; Redmont, by filing its petition against petitioners, is asserting the right of Filipinos over mining areas in the Philippines against alleged foreign-owned mining corporations.&nbsp;

This issue may be distilled into the more basic question of whether the <i>Complaint </i>raises a mining dispute or a judicial question.<br><br><b>A judicial question is a question that is proper for determination by the courts, as opposed to a moot question or one properly decided by the executive or legislative branch</b>. A judicial question is raised when the determination of the question involves the exercise of a judicial function; that is, the question involves the determination of what the law is and what the legal rights of the parties are with respect to the matter in controversy.<br><br>On the other hand, a mining dispute is a dispute involving (a) rights to mining areas, (b) mineral agreements, FTAAs, or permits, and (c) surface owners, occupants and claimholders/concessionaires. Under Republic Act No. 7942 (otherwise known as the Philippine Mining Act of 1995), the Panel of Arbitrators has exclusive and original jurisdiction to hear and decide these mining disputes.

The very terms of section 73 of the Mining Law, as amended by Republic Act No. 4388, in requiring that the adverse claim must <i>"state in full detail the nature, boundaries</i> and<i> extent</i> of the adverse claim" show that the conflicts to be decided by reason of such adverse claim refer primarily to questions of fact. This is made even clearer by the explanatory note to House Bill No. 2522, later to become Republic Act 4388, that "sections 61 and 73 that refer to the overlapping of claims are amended to expedite resolutions of mining conflicts * * *." <b>The controversies to be submitted and resolved by the Director of Mines under the sections refer therfore</b> [sic] <b>only to the overlapping of claims and administrative matters incidental thereto.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The pronouncements in <i>Celestial</i> cited by the ponencia were made to address the assertions of Celestial Nickel and Mining Corporation (Celestial Nickel) and Blue Ridge Mineral Corporation (Blue Ridge) that the Panel of Arbitrators had the power to cancel <i>existing</i> mineral agreements pursuant to Section 77 of the Mining Act.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Thus:<br><br><blockquote>Clearly, POA’s jurisdiction over “disputes involving rights to mining areas” has nothing to do with the cancellation of existing mineral agreements.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></blockquote><br>These pronouncements did not undo or abandon the distinction, clarified in <i>Gonzales, </i>between judicial questions and mining disputes.

It is a question that relates to the status of Narra, Tesoro, and McArthur and the legal rights (or inhibitions) accruing to them on account of their status. This does not entail a consideration of the specifications of mining arrangements and operations. Thus, the petitions filed by Redmont before the DENR Panel of Arbitrators relate to judicial questions and not to mining disputes. They relate to matters which are beyond the jurisdiction of the Panel of Arbitrators.<br><br>Furthermore nowhere in Section 77 of the Republic Act No. 7942 is there a grant of jurisdiction to the Panel of Arbitrators over the determination of the qualification of applicants.

The existence of a “dispute” presupposes that the party bringing the suit has a colorable or putative claim more superior than that of the respondent in the arbitration proceedings. After all, the Panel of Arbitrators is supposed to provide binding arbitration which should result in a binding award either in favor of the petitioner or the respondent. Thus, the Panel of Arbitrators is a qualified quasi-judicial agency. It does not perform all judicial functions in lieu of courts of law.<br><br>The petition brought by respondent before the Panel of Arbitrators <i>a quo </i>could not have resulted in any kind of award in its favor. It was asking for a judicial declaration at first instance of the qualification of the petitioners to hold mining agreements in accordance with the law. This clearly was beyond the jurisdiction of the Panel of Arbitrators and eventually also of the Mines Adjudication Board (MAB).<br><br>The remedy of Redmont should have been either to cause the cancellation of the registration of any of the petitioners with the Securities and Exchange Commission or to request for a determination of their qualifications with the Secretary of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources. Should either the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the Secretary of Environment and Natural Resources rule against its request, Redmont could have gone by certiorari to a Regional Trial Court.<br><br>Having brought their petitions to an entity without jurisdiction, the petition in this case should be granted.<br><br><b>Mining as a nationalized <br>economic activity</b><br><br>The determination of who may engage in mining activities is grounded in the 1987 Constitution and the Mining Act.<br><br>Article XII, Section 2 of the 1987 Constitution reads:<br><br><blockquote>Section 2.

In<i> Civil Liberties Union v.

Thus, it has been held that the Court in construing a Constitution should bear in mind the object sought to be accomplished by its adoption, and the evils, if any, sought to be prevented or remedied. A doubtful provision will be examined in the light of the history of the times, and the condition and circumstances under which the Constitution was framed. The object is to ascertain the reason which induced the framers of the Constitution to enact the particular provision and the purpose sought to be accomplished thereby, in order to construe the whole as to make the words consonant to that reason and calculated to effect that purpose.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup></blockquote><br>However, in the same case, this court also said:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup><br><br><blockquote>While it is permissible in this jurisdiction to consult the debates and proceedings of the constitutional convention in order to arrive at the reason and purpose of the resulting Constitution, resort thereto may be had only when other guides fail as said proceedings are powerless to vary the terms of the Constitution when the meaning is clear. <b>Debates in the constitutional convention “are of value as showing the views of the individual members, and as indicating the reasons for their votes, but they give us no light as to the views of the large majority who did not talk, much less of the mass of our fellow citizens whose votes at the polls gave that instrument the force of fundamental law.

We must assume that the authors intended the words to be read by generations who will have to live with the consequences of the provisions. The authors were not only the members of the Constitutional Commission but all those who participated in its ratification. Definitely, the ideas and opinions exchanged by a few of its commissioners should not be presumed to be the opinions of all of them. The result of the deliberations of the Commission resulted in a specific text, and it is that specific text—and only that text—which we must read and construe.<br><br>The preamble establishes that the “sovereign Filipino people” continue to “ordain and promulgate” the Constitution. The principle that “sovereignty resides in the people and all government authority emanates from them” is not hollow. Sovereign authority cannot be undermined by the ideas of a few Constitutional Commissioners participating in a forum in 1986 as against the realities that our people have to face in the present.<br><br>There is another, more fundamental, reason why reliance on the discussion of the Constitutional Commissioners should not be accepted as basis for determining the spirit behind constitutional provisions.

However, the quoted exchange fails to indicate a consensus or the general sentiment of the forty-nine (49) members<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[142]</sup> of the Constitutional Commission. What it indicates is, at most, an understanding between Commissioners Nolledo and Villegas, albeit with the latter claiming that the same understanding is shared by the Constitutional Commission’s Committee on National Economy and Patrimony. (Though even then, it is not established if this understanding is shared by the committee members unanimously, or by a majority of them, or is advanced by its leadership under the assumption that it may speak for the Committee.)<br><br>The 1987 Constitution is silent on the precise means through which foreign equity in a corporation shall be determined for the purpose of complying with nationalization requirements in each industry. If at all, it militates against the supposed preference for the Grandfather Rule that, its mention in the Constitutional Commission’s deliberations notwithstanding, the 1987 Constitution was, ultimately, inarticulate on adopting a specific test or means.<br><br>The 1987 Constitution is categorical in its omission. Its meaning is clear. That is to say, by its silence, it chose to not manifest a preference. Had there been any such preference, the Constitution could very well have said it.<br><br>In 1986, when the Constitution was being drafted, the Grandfather Rule and the Control Test were not novel concepts. Both tests have been articulated since as far back as 1967. The Foreign Investments Act, while adopted in 1991, has “predecessor statute[s]”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[143]</sup> dating to before 1986. As earlier mentioned, these predecessors also define the term “Philippine national” and in substantially the same manner that Section 3 (a) of the Foreign Investments Act does.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[144]</sup> It is the same definition: This is the same basis for applying the Control Test.<br><br>It is elementary that the Constitution is not primarily a lawyer’s document.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[145]</sup> As the convoluted history of the Control Test and Grandfather Rule shows, even those learned in the law have been in conflict, if not in outright confusion, as to their application. It is not proper to insist upon the Grandfather Rule as enshrined in the Constitution – and as manifesting the sovereign people’s will – when the Constitution makes absolutely no mention of it.<br><br>In the final analysis, the records of the Constitutional Commission do not bind this court. As Charles P. Curtis, Jr. said on the role of history in constitutional exegesis:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[146]</sup><br><br><blockquote>The intention of the framers of the Constitution, even assuming we could discover what it was, when it is not adequately expressed in the Constitution, that is to say, what they meant when they did not say it, surely that has no binding force upon us. <b>If we look behind or beyond what they set down in the document, prying into what else they wrote and what they said, anything we may find is only advisory.</b> They may sit in at our councils.

Thus, the proviso in Section 3 (a) of the Foreign Investments Act reads:<br><br><blockquote>Provided, That where a corporation and its non-Filipino stockholders own stocks in a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) registered enterprise, at least sixty percent (60%) of the capital stock outstanding and entitled to vote of each of both corporations must be owned and held by citizens of the Philippines and at least sixty percent (60%) of the members of the Board of Directors of each of both corporations must be citizens of the Philippines, in order that the corporation shall be considered a Philippine national[.]</blockquote><br>Supplementing this is the last sentence of the first paragraph of Rule I, Section 1 (b) of the implementing rules and regulations of the Foreign Investments Act: “The Control Test shall be applied for this purpose.”<br><br>As such, by congressional dictum, which is properly interpreted by administrative rule making, the <i>Control Test </i>must govern in reckoning foreign equity ownership in corporations engaged in nationalized economic activities.

From this, it follows, as a matter of transitivity, that A controls C; albeit indirectly, that is, through B.<br><br>This “control” holds true regardless of the aggregate foreign capital in B and C. As explained in <i>Gamboa</i>, control by stockholders is a matter resting on the ability to vote in the election of directors:<br><blockquote>Indisputably, one of the rights of a stockholder is the right to participate in the control or management of the corporation.

Another corporation, Indo Phil Textile Mills, Inc. (Indo Phil), intended to subscribe to 70% of the proposed corporation’s capital stock upon incorporation. The remainder (i.e., 30%) of the proposed corporation’s capital stock would have been subscribed to by Filipinos. For its part, Indo Phil was owned by foreign stockholders to the extent of 56%. Thus, it was only 44% Filipino-owned.<br><br>Applying the Grandfather Rule, the aggregate Filipino stockholdings in the proposed corporation was computed to amount to 60.8%. As such, the proposed corporation was deemed to be of Filipino nationality.<br><br>A consideration of the same case, with emphasis on the matter of “control” (and therefore in a manner more in keeping with the rationale for nationalization), should yield a different conclusion.<br><br>Considering that there is no indication in the SEC opinion that any of the shares in Indo Phil do not have voting rights, it must be assumed that all such shares have voting rights. As the foreign stockholdings in Indo Phil amount to 56%, control of Indo Phil is held by foreign nationals; that is, this 56% can outvote the 44% stockholding of Indo Phil’s Filipino stockholders. Since control of the proposed corporation will rest on Indo Phil (which is to hold 70% of its capital), this control would ultimately rest on those who control Indo Phil; that is, its 56% foreign stockholding.<br><br>Had the Control Test been applied, Indo Phil would have, at the onset, been deemed to have failed to satisfy the requisite Filipino equity ownership, and its 70% stockholding in the proposed corporation would have been deemed not held by Philippine nationals. The Control Test would thus have averted an aberrant result where a corporation ultimately controlled by foreign nationals was deemed to have satisfied the requisite Filipino equity ownership.<br><br><b>The Control Test satisfies the<br>beneficial ownership requirement </b><br><br>Apart from control (through voting rights), also significant is “beneficial ownership”. In the 2011 decision in <i>Gamboa</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[161]</sup> this court stated:<br><br><blockquote>Mere legal title is insufficient to meet the 60 percent Filipino-owned “capital” required in the Constitution. Full beneficial ownership of 60 percent of the outstanding capital stock, coupled with 60 percent of the voting rights, is required. The legal and beneficial ownership of 60 percent of the outstanding capital stock must rest in the hands of Filipino nationals in accordance with the constitutional mandate. Otherwise, the corporation is “considered as non-Philippine national[s].”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[162]</sup></blockquote><br>The concept of “beneficial ownership” is not novel. The implementing rules and regulations (amended 2004) of Republic Act No. 8799, the Securities Regulation Code (SRC), defines “beneficial owner or beneficial ownership” as follows:<br><br><blockquote>SRC Rule 3 – Definition of Terms Used in the Rules and Regulations<br><ol><li>As used in the rules and regulations adopted by the Commission under the Code, unless the context otherwise requires:<br><br><ol type="A"><li><b>Beneficial owner</b> or beneficial ownership <b>means any person who, directly <i>or indirectly</i></b>, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship or otherwise, <b>has or shares voting power</b>, which includes the power to vote, or to direct the voting of such security; <b>and/or investment returns or power</b>, which includes the power to dispose of, or to direct the disposition of such security; <b>provided, however, that a person shall be deemed to have an <i>indirect beneficial ownership</i> interest in any security which is</b>:<br></li></ol><br><ol type="i"><li>held by members of his immediate family sharing the same household;<br><br></li><li>held by a partnership in which he is a general partner;<br><br></li><li><b>held by a corporation of which he is a controlling shareholder;</b> or<br><br></li><li>subject to any contract, arrangement or understanding which gives him voting power or investment power with respect to such securities; provided however, that the following persons or institutions shall not be deemed to be beneficial owners of securities held by them for the benefit of third parties or in customer or fiduciary accounts in the ordinary course of business, so long as such shares were acquired by such persons or institutions without the purpose or effect of changing or influencing control of the issuer:</li></ol><br><ol type="a"><li>a broker dealer;<br><br></li><li>an investment house registered under the Investment Houses Law;<br><br></li><li>a bank authorized to operate as such by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas;<br><br></li><li>an insurance company subject to the supervision of the Office of the Insurance Commission;<br><br></li><li>an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act;<br><br></li><li>a pension plan subject to regulation and supervision by the Bureau of Internal Revenue and/or the Office of the Insurance Commission or relevant authority; and<br><br></li><li>a group in which all of the members are persons specified above.</li></ol></li></ol><br>All securities of the same class beneficially owned by a person, regardless of the form such beneficial ownership takes, shall be aggregated in calculating the number of shares beneficially owned by such person.<br><br>A person shall be deemed to be the beneficial owner of a security if that person has the right to acquire beneficial ownership, within thirty (30) days, including, but not limited to, any right to acquire, through the exercise of any option, warrant or right; through the conversion of any security; pursuant to the power to revoke a trust, discretionary account or similar arrangement; or pursuant to automatic termination of a trust, discretionary account or similar arrangement. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Thus, there are two (2) ways through which one may be a beneficial owner of securities, such as shares of stock: first, by having or sharing voting power; and second, by having or sharing investment returns or power. By the implementing rules’ use of “and/or”, either of the two suffices. They are alternative means which may or may not concur.<br><br>Voting power, as discussed previously, ultimately rests on the controlling stockholders of the controlling investor corporation. To go back to the previous illustration, voting power ultimately rests on A, it having the voting power in B which, in turn, has the voting power in C.<br><br>As to investment returns or power, it is ultimately A which enjoys investment power. It controls B’s investment decisions – including the disposition of securities held by B – and (again, through B) controls C’s investment decisions.<br><br>Similarly, it is ultimately A which benefits from investment returns generated through C. Any income generated by C redounds to B’s benefit, that is, through income obtained from C, B gains funds or assets which it can use either to finance itself in respect of capital and/or operations. This is a direct benefit to B, itself a Philippine national. This is also an indirect benefit to A, a collectivity of Philippine nationals, as then, its business – B – not only becomes more viable as a going concern but also becomes equipped to funnel income to A.<br><br>Moreover, beneficial ownership need not be direct. A controlling shareholder is deemed the indirect beneficial owner of securities (e.g., shares) held by a corporation of which he or she is a controlling shareholder. Thus, in the previous illustration, A, the controlling shareholder of B, is the indirect beneficial owner of the shares in C to the extent that they are held by B.<br><br><b>Practical difficulties with<br>the Grandfather Rule</b><br><br>Per SEC-OGC Opinion No. 10-31, the Grandfather Rule calls for the aggregation of stockholdings on the basis of the individual stockholders (i.e., natural persons) of every investor corporation.

The threshold to qualify as a Philippine national, whether as a stand-alone corporation or one involving investments from or by other corporation/s, is 60% Filipino equity ownership. Failing this, a corporation must be deemed to be of foreign nationality.<br><br>The necessary implication of Section 3 (a) of the FIA is that anything that fails to breach this 60% threshold is not a Philippine national. There is no “doubt”, as DOJ Opinion No. 20, series of 2005, posits. Any declaration, in the Mining Act or elsewhere, that a corporation in which Filipino equity ownership is less than 50% is deemed foreign-owned is merely to articulate – so as to eliminate uncertainty – the natural consequence of Filipinos’ minority shareholding in a corporation. Ultimately, the positive determination of what makes a Philippine national, per Section 3 (a) of the Foreign Investments Act, is that which controls.<br><br><b>The Grandfather Rule may<br>be applied as a supplement to<br>the Control Test </b><br><br>This standard under the Foreign Investments Act is the <i>Control Test.</i> Its application can be nuanced if there is a clear showing that the context of a case requires it.

Esguerra, Lauro Salazar, and Emmanuel G. Hernando, who are all Filipino, collectively own 6,667 shares in or 66.67% of the capital stock of Madridejos. Madridejos is thus <i>ostensibly</i> a Filipino corporation (i.e., it is controlled by Philippine nationals who own more than 60% of its capital as required by Section 3 (a) of the Foreign Investments Act).<br><br>Madridejos combined with Lauro L. Salazar, Fernando B. Esguerra, and Manuel A. Agcaoili, who are all Filipinos, collectively own 6,000 shares in or 60% of the capital stock of McArthur. As McArthur has satisfied the minimum Filipino equity ownership (i.e., 60%) required by Section 3 (a) of the Foreign Investments Act, it is ostensibly a Filipino corporation. Moreover, as it has satisfied the minimum Filipino equity ownership (i.e., 60%) required by Section 3 (aq) of the Mining Act to be deemed a qualified person for purposes of mineral agreements, McArthur is ostensibly qualified to enter into an MPSA.<br><br>In its October 1, 2010 decision, the Court of Appeals, Seventh Division, made much of a joint venture entered into by the Canadian Corporation, MBMI Resources Inc. with OMDC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[176]</sup> This joint venture was denominated “Olympic Properties”. Per MBMI’s 2006 Annual report, MBMI was noted to hold “directly and indirectly an initial 60% interest in [Olympic Properties].”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[177]</sup> This joint venture, however, does not factor into the respective stockholders’ genealogies of Tesoro and McArthur. It is an independent venture entered into by OMDC with MBMI. It is OMDC, and not Olympic Properties, which owns shares in Tesoro and McArthur. It is, therefore, of no consequence that MBMI holds a 60% interest in Olympic Properties.<br><br>Having made these observations, it should not be discounted that a more thorough consideration – as has been intimated in the earlier disquisition regarding how 60% Filipino equity ownership is but a minimum and how the Grandfather Rule may be applied to further examine actual Filipino ownership – could yield an entirely different conclusion. In fact, Redmont has asserted that such a situation avails.<br><br><b><i>However, the contingencies of this case must restrain the court’s consideration of Redmont’s claims. Redmont sought relief from a body without jurisdiction – the Panel of Arbitrators – and has engaged in blatant forum shopping. It has taken liberties with and ran amok of rules that define fair play. It is, therefore, bound by its lapses and indiscretions and must bear the consequences of its imprudence.</i></b><br><br><b>Redmont has been engaged <br>in blatant forum shopping&nbsp; </b><br><br>The concept of and rationale against forum shopping was explained by this court in <i>Top Rate Construction and General Services, Inc. v. Paxton Development Corporation</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[178]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Forum shopping is committed by a party who institutes two or more suits in different courts, either simultaneously or successively, in order to ask the courts to rule on the <b>same or <i>related</i> causes or to grant the same or <i>substantially the same</i> reliefs</b>, on the supposition that one or the other court would make a favorable disposition or increase a party's chances of obtaining a favorable decision or action. It is an act of malpractice for it trifles with the courts, abuses their processes, degrades the administration of justice and adds to the already congested court dockets. <b>What is critical is the vexation brought upon the courts and the litigants by a party who asks different courts to rule on the same or <i>related</i> causes and grant the same or <i>substantially the same</i> reliefs and in the process creates the possibility of conflicting decisions being rendered by the different for a upon the same issues</b>, regardless of whether the court in which one of the suits was brought has no jurisdiction over the action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[179]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Equally settled is the test for determining forum shopping. As this court explained in<i> Yap v. Court of Appeals</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[180]</sup><br><br><blockquote>To determine whether a party violated the rule against forum shopping, the most important factor to ask is whether the elements of <i>litis pendentia</i> are present, or whether a final judgment in one case will amount to <i>res judicata</i> in another; otherwise stated, the test for determining forum shopping is whether in the two (or more) cases pending, there is identity of parties, rights or causes of action, and reliefs sought.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[181]</sup></blockquote><br>Litis pendentia “refers to that situation wherein another action is pending between the same parties for the same cause of action, such that the second action becomes unnecessary and vexatious.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[182]</sup> It requires the concurrence of three (3) requisites: (1) the identity of parties, or at least such as representing the same interests in both actions; (2) the identity of rights asserted and relief prayed for, the relief being founded on the same facts; and (3) the identity of the two cases such that judgment in one, regardless of which party is successful, would amount to <i>res judicata</i> in the other.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[183]</sup><br><br>In turn, prior judgment or res judicata bars a subsequent case when the following requisites concur: (1) the former judgment is final; (2) it is rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties; (3) it is a judgment or an order on the merits; (4) there is – between the first and the second actions – identity of parties, of subject matter, and of causes of action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[184]</sup><br><br>Redmont has taken at least four (4) distinct routes all seeking substantially the same remedy. Stripped of their verbosity and legalese, Redmont’s petitions before the DENR Panel of Arbitrators, complaint before the Regional Trial Court, complaint before the Securities and Exchange Commission, and petition before the Office of the President all seek to prevent Narra, Tesoro, and McArthur as well as their co-respondents and/or co-defendants from engaging in mining operations. Moreover, these are all grounded on the same cause (i.e., that they are disqualified from doing so because they fail to satisfy the requisite Filipino equity ownership) and premised on the same facts or circumstances.<br><br>Redmont has created a situation where multiple tribunals must rule on the extent to which the parties adverse to Redmont have met the requisite Filipino equity ownership. It is certainly possible that conflicting decisions will be issued by the various tribunals over which Redmont’s various applications for relief have been lodged. It is, thus, glaring that the very evil sought to be prevented by the rule against forum shopping is being foisted by Redmont.<br><br>The consequences of willful forum shopping are clear. Rule 7, Section 5 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 5. <i>Certification against forum shopping</i>. — The plaintiff or principal party shall certify under oath in the complaint or other initiatory pleading asserting a claim for relief, or in a sworn certification annexed thereto and simultaneously filed therewith: (a) that he has not theretofore commenced any action or filed any claim involving the same issues in any court, tribunal or quasi-judicial agency and, to the best of his knowledge, no such other action or claim is pending therein; (b) if there is such other pending action or claim, a complete statement of the present status thereof; and (c) if he should thereafter learn that the same or similar action or claim has been filed or is pending, he shall report that fact within five (5) days therefrom to the court wherein his aforesaid complaint or initiatory pleading has been filed.<br><br>Failure to comply with the foregoing requirements shall not be curable by mere amendment of the complaint or other initiatory pleading but shall be cause for the dismissal of the case without prejudice, unless otherwise provided, upon motion and after hearing. The submission of a false certification or non-compliance with any of the undertakings therein shall constitute indirect contempt of court, without prejudice to the corresponding administrative and criminal actions.<b> If the acts of the party or his counsel clearly constitute willful and deliberate forum shopping, the same shall be ground for summary dismissal with prejudice and shall constitute direct contempt, as well as a cause for administrative sanctions.</b> (n)</blockquote><br>It strains credulity to accept that Redmont’s actions have not been willful. By filing petitions with the DENR Panel of Arbitrators, Redmont started the entire series of events that have culminated in: first, the present petition; second, the de-consolidated G.R. No. 205513; and third, at least one (1) more petition filed with this court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[185]</sup><br><br>Following the adverse decision of the Panel of Arbitrators, Narra, Tesoro, and McArthur pursued appeals before the Mines Adjudication Board. This is all but a logical consequence of the POA’s adverse decision. While the appeal before the MAB was pending, Redmont filed a complaint with the SEC and then filed a complaint with the Regional Trial Court to enjoin the MAB from proceeding. Redmont seems to have conveniently forgotten that it was its own actions that gave rise to the proceedings before the MAB in the first place. Moreover, even as all these were pending and in various stages of appeal and/or review, Redmont still filed a petition before the Office of the President.<br><br>Consistent with Rule 7, Section 5 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, the actions subject of these consolidated petitions must be dismissed with prejudice.<br><br>It should also not escape this court’s attention that the vexatious actions of Redmont would not have been possible were it not for the permissiveness of Redmont’s counsels. To reiterate, willful forum shopping leads not only to an action’s dismissal with prejudice but “shall [also] constitute direct contempt, [and is] a cause for administrative sanctions.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[186]</sup> Redmont’s counsels should be reminded that the parameters established by judicial (and even administrative) proceedings, such as the rule against forum shopping, are not to be trifled with.<br><br>ACCORDINGLY, I vote to <b>GRANT</b> the petition for review on certiorari subject of G.R.
