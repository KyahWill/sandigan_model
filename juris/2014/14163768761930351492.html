Moreover, the term agricultural lands as defined in Section 3 (c) of RA 6657 do not include those lands already classified as mineral, forest, residential, commercial or industrial.&nbsp; <b><i>The case at hand shows that the subject property is within the non-agricultural zone prior to 15 June 1988.</i></b><br><br><b><i>Further, said lands reclassified to non-agricultural prior to June 15, 1988 ceased to be considered as “agricultural lands” and removed from the coverage of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program.</i></b><br><br>After a careful evaluation of the documents presented, this office finds substantial compliance by the applicant with the documentary requirements prescribed under DAR Administrative Order No. 04, Series of 2003.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The exemption orders clearly provide that the lands were reclassified to non-agricultural prior to June 15, 1988, or prior to the effectivity of Republic Act No. 6657 known as the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 1988 (CARL).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>Section 3(c) of the CARL defines “agricultural land” as “land devoted to agricultural activity as defined in this Act and not classified as mineral, forest, residential, commercial or industrial land.”<br><br>This meaning was further explained by DAR Administrative Order No. 1, Series of 1990, otherwise known as the Revised Rules and Regulations Governing Conversion of Private Agricultural Lands to Non-Agricultural Uses:<br><br><blockquote>. . . . Agricultural land refers to those devoted to agricultural activity as defined in R.A. 6657 and not classified as mineral or forest by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) and its predecessor agencies, and <b><i>not classified in town plans and zoning ordinances as approved by the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB) and its preceding competent authorities prior to 15 June 1988 for residential, commercial or industrial use.</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)</blockquote><br>While the earlier Republic Act No. 3844,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> otherwise known as the Agricultural Land Reform Code, focuses on actual use of the land when it defines “agricultural land” as “land devoted to any growth, including but not limited to crop lands, salt beds, fish ponds, idle land<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> and abandoned land<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> as defined in paragraphs 18 and 19 of this Section, respectively,”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> this must be read with the later Republic Act No. 6675 (CARL) that qualifies the definition with land classifications.<br><br>Second, in <i>Sta.

Ana</i>, respondent spouses do not contend that the reclassification of the land was by a “mere vicinity map.”&nbsp; Their contention is that it was made only in 1995, thus, the land remains within CARP coverage unless petitioners secure a certificate of exemption or exclusion, or a duly approved conversion order.<br><br>As earlier discussed, petitioners have secured exemption orders for the lands.<br><br><b><center>I.C<br>Consent; nature of relationship<br></center></b><br>Respondent spouses allege that petitioners “never contest[ed] nor refute[d] [respondent’s] cultivation and occupation of residence in the land (since 1990) for the past ten (10) years or so.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup>&nbsp; This brings us to the third requisite on consent.<br><br>Respondent spouses argue that petitioners’ inaction or failure to refute their occupation and cultivation of the land for the past 10 years, coupled with the acceptance of payments for use of the land, is “indicative of consent, if not acquiescence to . . . tenancy relations.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup>&nbsp; They contend that a “[t]enancy relationship may be deemed established by implied agreement [when a] landowner allows another [to] cultivate his land in the concept of a tenant for a period of ten (10) years.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup>&nbsp; They add that Automat cannot deny the authority of administrator, petitioner Cecilia, whose acts are binding on the landowner.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, petitioners argue that the acts of the parties “taken in their entirety must be demonstrative of an intent to continue a prior tenancy relationship established by the landholder.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup>&nbsp; There should be “no issue . . .
