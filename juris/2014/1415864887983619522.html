				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">No person should unjustly enrich himself or herself at the expense of another.<br><br>This is a petition for review on certiorari<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> to set aside the Court of Appeals’ decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> in CA-G.R. CV No. 81882.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals ordered petitioner Carlos A. Loria to pay respondent Ludolfo P.

Muñoz, Jr. (Muñoz) filed a complaint for sum of money and damages with an application for issuance of a writ of preliminary attachment against Carlos A. Loria (Loria) with the Regional Trial Court of Legazpi City.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>In his complaint, Muñoz alleged that he has been engaged in construction under the name, “Ludolfo P. Muñoz, Jr. Construction.”&nbsp; In August 2000, Loria visited Muñoz in his office in Doña Maria Subdivision in Daraga, Albay.&nbsp; He invited Muñoz to advance P2,000,000.00 for a subcontract of a P50,000,000.00 river-dredging project in Guinobatan.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Loria represented that he would make arrangements such that Elizaldy Co, owner of Sunwest Construction and Development Corporation, would turn out to be the lowest bidder for the project.&nbsp; Elizaldy Co would pay P8,000,000.00 to ensure the project’s award to Sunwest.&nbsp; After the award to Sunwest, Sunwest would subcontract 20% or P10,000,000.00 worth of the project to Muñoz.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Since Muñoz had known Loria for five years, Muñoz accepted Loria’s proposal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On October 2, 2000, Muñoz requested Allied Bank to release P3,000,000.00 from his joint account with his business partner, Christopher Co, to a certain Grace delos Santos (delos Santos).&nbsp; Loria then obtained the money from delos Santos.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Four days later, P1,800,000.00 of the P3,000,000.00 was returned to Muñoz.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On January 10, 2001, Loria collected Muñoz’s P800,000.00 balance.&nbsp; After deducting Loria’s personal loans from Muñoz, Muñoz issued a check to Loria for P481,800.00.&nbsp; Loria acknowledged receiving this amount from Muñoz.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The project to dredge the Masarawag and San Francisco Rivers in Guinobatan was subjected to public bidding.&nbsp; The project was awarded to the lowest bidder, Sunwest Construction and Development Corporation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Sunwest allegedly finished dredging the Masarawag and San Francisco Rivers without subcontracting Muñoz.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>&nbsp; With the project allegedly finished, Muñoz demanded Loria to return his P2,000,000.00.&nbsp; Loria, however, did not return the money.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Muñoz first charged Loria and Elizaldy Co with estafa.&nbsp; This criminal case was dismissed by the Municipal Trial Court of Daraga, Albay for lack of probable cause.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Muñoz then filed the complaint for sum of money.&nbsp; The case was raffled to Branch 6 and presided by Judge Vladimir B. Brusola.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Loria answered Muñoz’s complaint.&nbsp; He admitted receiving P481,800.00 from Muñoz but argued that the complaint did not state a cause of action against him.&nbsp; According to Loria, he followed up the project’s approval with the Central Office of the Department of Public Works and Highways as the parties agreed upon.&nbsp; He was, therefore, entitled to his representation expenses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Loria also argued that Muñoz was guilty of forum shopping.&nbsp; Muñoz first filed a criminal complaint for estafa against him and Elizaldy Co, which complaint the Municipal Trial Court of Daraga, Albay dismissed.&nbsp; The subsequently filed complaint for sum of money, allegedly a complaint to recover the civil aspect of the estafa case, must, therefore, be dismissed as argued by Loria.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>During pre-trial, the parties agreed to litigate the sole issue of whether Loria is liable to Muñoz for P2,000,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>According to the trial court, Muñoz established with preponderant evidence that Loria received P2,000,000.00 from Muñoz for a subcontract of the river-dredging project.&nbsp; Since no part of the project was subcontracted to Muñoz, Loria must return the P2,000,000.00 he received, or he would be “unduly enriching himself at the expense of [Muñoz].”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>On the claim of forum shopping, the trial court ruled that Loria’s obligation to return the P2,000,000.00 did not arise from criminal liability. Muñoz may, therefore, file a civil action to recover his P2,000,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>As to the prayer for issuance of a writ of preliminary attachment, the trial court denied the prayer for lack of sufficient basis.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Thus, in the decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> dated January 30, 2004, the trial court ordered Loria to return the P2,000,000.00 to Muñoz as actual damages with 12% interest from the filing of the complaint until the amount’s full payment.&nbsp; The trial court likewise ordered Loria to pay Muñoz P100,000.00 in attorney’s fees, P25,000.00 in litigation expenses, and P25,000.00 in exemplary damages with costs against Loria.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Loria appealed to the Court of Appeals, arguing that Muñoz failed to establish his receipt of the P2,000,000.00.&nbsp; Specifically, Muñoz failed to establish that he obtained P3,000,000.00 from a certain Grace delos Santos.&nbsp; Loria also appealed the award of attorney’s fees, litigation expenses, and exemplary damages for having no basis in fact and in law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals sustained the trial court’s factual findings.&nbsp; In ruling that Loria received the net amount of P2,000,000.00 from Muñoz, the Court of Appeals referred to Muñoz’s testimony that he ordered Allied Bank to release P3,000,000.00 from his joint account with Christopher Co to a certain Grace delos Santos.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; Loria then obtained the money from delos Santos and confirmed with Muñoz his receipt of the money.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; This testimony, according to the appellate court, was supported by Exhibit “C,” a check voucher the trial court admitted in evidence.&nbsp; Loria signed this check voucher and acknowledged receiving P1,200,000.00 on October 2, 2000 and P800,000.00 on January 10, 2001, or a total of P2,000,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Considering that Muñoz did not benefit from paying Loria P2,000,000.00, the appellate court ruled that Loria must return the money to Muñoz under the principle of unjust enrichment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>The appellate court, however, ruled that Muñoz failed to show his right to exemplary damages and attorney’s fees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Thus, in the decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> dated October 23, 2008, the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court’s decision but deleted the award of exemplary damages and attorney’s fees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; The appellate court likewise denied Loria’s motion for reconsideration in the resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> dated March 12, 2009.<br><br>Loria filed a petition for review on certiorari<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> with this court, arguing that the principle of unjust enrichment does not apply in this case.&nbsp; As the trial and appellate courts found, Muñoz paid Loria P2,000,000.00 for a subcontract of a government project.&nbsp; The parties’ agreement, therefore, was void for being contrary to law, specifically, the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, the Revised Penal Code, and Section 6 of Presidential Decree No. 1594.&nbsp; The agreement was likewise contrary to the public policy of public or open competitive bidding of government contracts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Since the parties’ agreement was void, Loria argues that the parties were<i> in pari delicto,</i> and Muñoz should not be allowed to recover the money he gave under the contract.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>On the finding that he received a net amount of P2,000,000.00 from Muñoz, Loria maintains that Muñoz failed to prove his receipt of P3,000,000.00 through a certain Grace delos Santos.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>In the resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> dated June 3, 2009, this court ordered Muñoz to comment on Loria’s petition.<br><br>In his comment,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Muñoz argues that Loria’s petition raises questions of fact and law that the trial and appellate courts have already passed upon and resolved in his favor.&nbsp; He prays that this court deny Loria’s petition for raising questions of fact.<br><br>Loria replied<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> to the comment, arguing that he raised only questions of law in his petition.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>&nbsp; Even assuming that he raised questions of fact, Loria argues that this does not warrant the automatic dismissal of his petition since the trial and appellate courts allegedly erred in ruling for Muñoz.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>On October 8, 2010, the parties filed their joint motion to render judgment based on the compromise agreement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>&nbsp; In their compromise agreement,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> the parties declared that this case “was a product of a mere misunderstanding.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>&nbsp; To amicably settle their dispute, the parties agreed to waive all their claims, rights, and interests against each other.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>This court denied the joint motion for lack of merit in the resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> dated December 15, 2010.<br><br>The issues for our resolution are the following:<br><br><ol type="I"><li>IWhether Loria initially obtained P3,000,000.00 from a certain Grace delos Santos<br></li><li>Whether Loria is liable for P2,000,000.00 to Muñoz<br></li><li> We rule for Muñoz and deny Loria’s petition for review on certiorari.<br></li></ol><br><center>I<br></center><br><b>Whether Loria initially received<br>P3,000,000.00 is a question of <br>fact not proper in a petition for<br>review on certiorari</b><br><br>We first address Loria’s contention that Muñoz failed to prove his initial receipt of P3,000,000.00.&nbsp;

PR Builders, Inc.,</i> “when a person unjustly retains a benefit at the loss of another, or when a person retains money or property of another against the fundamental principles of justice, equity and good conscience.”&nbsp; The prevention of unjust enrichment is a recognized public policy of the State, for Article 22 of the Civil Code explicitly provides that “[e]very person who through an act of performance by another, or any other means, acquires or comes into possession of something at the expense of the latter without just or legal ground, shall return the same to him.”&nbsp; It is well to note that Article 22 “is part of the chapter of the Civil Code on Human Relations, the provisions of which were formulated as basic principles to be observed for the rightful relationship between human beings and for the stability of the social order; designed to indicate certain norms that spring from the fountain of good conscience; guides for human conduct that should run as golden threads through society to the end that law may approach its supreme ideal which is the sway and dominance of justice.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br>Given that Tarnate, Jr. performed his obligations under the subcontract and the deed of assignment, this court ruled that he was entitled to the agreed fee.&nbsp; According to this court, Gonzalo “would be unjustly enriched at the expense of Tarnate if the latter was to be barred from recovering because of the rigid application of the doctrine of <i>in pari delicto.</i>”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>In this case, both the trial and appellate courts found that Loria received P2,000,000.00 from Muñoz for a subcontract of the river-dredging project.&nbsp; Loria never denied that he failed to fulfill his agreement with Muñoz.&nbsp; Throughout the case’s proceedings, Loria failed to justify why he has the right to retain Muñoz’s P2,000,000.00.&nbsp; As the Court of Appeals ruled, “it was not shown that [Muñoz] benefited from the delivery of the amount of P2,000,000.00 to [Loria].”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>Loria, therefore, is retaining the P2,000,000.00 without just or legal ground.&nbsp; This cannot be done.
