				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Public trust requires that we exact strict integrity from judges and court employees. This case emphasizes the need for members of the judiciary and those within its employ to exhibit the impartiality, prudence, and propriety that the New Code of Judicial Conduct and the Code of Conduct for Court Personnel require when dealing with parties in pending cases.<br><br>Complainant Emilie Sison-Barias is involved in three cases pending before the sala of respondent Judge Marino Rubia.<br><br>The first case is an intestate proceeding.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Complainant filed a petition for letters of administration over the intestate estate of her late husband, Ramon A. Barias. This was opposed by her mother-in-law, Romelias Almeda-Barias.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>The second case is a guardianship proceeding over Romelias Almeda-Barias.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Evelyn Tanael, the guardian appointed by the court, submitted a property inventory report that included not only the properties of Romelias Almeda-Barias but also properties forming part of the estate of complainant’s late husband.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>The third case is a civil action<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> for annulment of contracts and reconveyance of real properties filed by Romelias Almeda-Barias, represented by Evelyn Tanael, against complainant, among others.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>In all these cases, a parcel of land covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-510712 and part of the estate of complainant’s husband was involved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Complainant alleged that there was delay in the publication of the notice in the petition for issuance of letters of administration filed. She was then informed by her brother, Enrique “Ike” Sison, that respondent Eileen Pecaña, the daughter of his good friend, was a data encoder in the Office of the Clerk of Court of the Regional Trial Court of Biñan, Laguna.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Complainant, together with her two brothers, Enrique and Perlito “Jun” Sison, Jr.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> met with respondent Pecaña on February 20, 2010.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> During this meeting, complainant informed respondent Pecaña of the delay in the publication of the notice in the petition for issuance of letters of administration. She then asked respondent Pecaña to check the status of the publication of the notice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Respondent Pecaña asked for complainant’s number so that she could inform her as soon as any development takes place in the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Enrique<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> and Perlito<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> executed affidavits to corroborate these allegations.<br><br>Respondent Pecaña asked complainant to meet her again at her house in Biñan, Laguna.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Complainant went there with Enrique.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Respondent Pecaña then informed complainant that she could no longer assist her since respondent Judge Rubia had already given administration of the properties to Evelyn Tanael.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Complainant stated that she was not interested in the grant of administration to Tanael because these concerned the properties of her mother-in-law, Romelias Almeda-Barias.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> She was only concerned with the administration of the properties of her late husband, to which respondent Pecaña replied, “<i>Ah ganun ba? Iba pala ung kaso mo.</i>”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Complainant alleged that respondent Pecaña sent her a text message on March 2, 2010<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> asking complainant to call her. Complainant called respondent Pecaña who informed her that respondent Judge Rubia wanted to talk to her.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Complainant agreed to meet with respondent Judge Rubia over dinner, on the condition that respondent Pecaña would be present as well.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>On March 3, 2010<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> at around 7:00 p.m, complainant picked up respondent Pecaña at 6750 Ayala Avenue in Makati City. They proceeded to Café Juanita in The Fort, Bonifacio Global City. Respondent Pecaña said that respondent Judge Rubia would arrive late as he would be coming from a Rotary Club meeting held at the Mandarin Hotel.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Respondent Judge Rubia arrived at Café Juanita around 8:30 p.m. During the dinner meeting, respondents allegedly asked complainant inappropriate questions. Respondent Judge Rubia allegedly asked whether she was still connected with Philippine Airlines, which she still was at that time.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Complainant was then informed that respondent Judge Rubia knew of this fact through Atty. Noe Zarate, counsel of Romelias Almeda-Barias.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> This disclosure surprised complainant, as she was under the impression that opposing counsel and respondent Judge Rubia had no business discussing matters that were not relevant to their pending cases.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Respondent Judge Rubia also allegedly asked her questions about her supposed involvement with another man and other accusations made by Romelias Almeda-Barias.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> She was asked about the hospital where she brought her husband at the time of his cardiac arrest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>These details, according to complainant, were never discussed in the pleadings or in the course of the trial.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Thus, she inferred that respondent Judge Rubia had been talking to the opposing counsel regarding these matters outside of the court proceedings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The impression of complainant was that respondent Judge Rubia was actively taking a position in favor of Atty. Zarate.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>To confirm her suspicion, respondents then allegedly “told complainant to just talk to Atty. Zarate, counsel for the oppositor, claiming that he is a nice person. Complainant was appalled by such suggestion and replied[,] ‘<i>Why will I talk to him? Judge di ko yata kaya gawin un.</i>’”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>After dinner, complainant stayed behind to settle the bill. Even before he left, she alleged that respondent Judge Rubia had made insinuations that she was awaiting the company of another man.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>From then on, complainant and respondents did not communicate and/or meet outside the courtroom until August 8, 2010.<br><br>In the meantime, complainant alleged that respondent Judge Rubia acted in a manner that showed manifest partiality in favor of the opposing parties, namely, Romelias Almeda-Barias and Evelyn Tanael, as represented by their counsel, Atty. Noe Zarate.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>On June 15, 2010, counsel for complainant was personally handed a copy of a motion for consolidation filed by the oppositor, Romelias Almeda-Barias, despite the date of the hearing on such motion being set on June 18, 2010.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Complainant alleged that respondent Judge Rubia did not even consider the comment/opposition to the motion for consolidation filed by her counsel, which stated that since two of these cases were special proceedings, they could not be consolidated with an ordinary civil action. Respondent Judge Rubia insisted on discussing the totality of the different issues involved in the three distinct cases under one court proceeding.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> As such, complainant alleged that the main issues of the special proceedings were consolidated with matters that were properly the subject of a separate civil action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Complainant alleged that respondent Judge Rubia refused to issue orders<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> that would have allowed her to comply with her duties as the special administrator of her late husband’s estate.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> This included the order to conduct an inventory of the properties, rights, and credits of the deceased, subject to the authority of the administrator.<br><br>In addition, complainant alleged that respondent Judge Rubia refused to grant her request for subpoena duces tecum and ad testificandum that she had prayed for to compel Evelyn Tanael to produce the documents showing the accrued rentals of the parcel of land belonging to her late husband.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> As such, complainant raised that respondent Judge Rubia’s refusal emboldened Evelyn Tanael and oppositor Romelias Almeda-Barias to interfere in the management of the estate of complainant’s late husband.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Because of this refusal, she asserted that respondent Judge Rubia failed to adhere to the duty of the court to ensure a proper inventory of the estate.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Complainant enumerated occasions that alleged manifest partiality on the part of respondent Judge Rubia. She alleged that respondent Judge Rubia failed to require a timely filing of the pre-trial brief on the part of Evelyn Tanael and Romelias Almeda-Barias, and despite their non-compliance on four (4) separate pre-trials that were postponed, Tanael and Almeda-Barias were not declared in default.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> She also alleged that respondent Judge Rubia stated that the burden to prove ownership of the property was on complainant, when in fact it was the oppositor, or Tanael and Almeda-Barias, who had the burden of proof to show that the land was fraudulently transferred to her late husband.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Complainant admitted that she did not inform her counsel of the dinner meeting she had with respondents.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> It was Enrique who allegedly told complainant’s lawyers about it when he went to the lawyer’s office to pay some bills.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Complainant said that her lawyer immediately admonished her for agreeing to meet with respondent Judge Rubia. Complainant then texted respondent Pecaña on August 8, 2010 on her lawyer’s reaction concerning the March 3, 2010 meeting. The following exchanges took place via text message:<br><br><blockquote>COMPLAINANT:<br><br>Hi Aileen! Sorry jz feeling bad. . my lawyer jz called me at galit n galit.

Respondent Pecaña hesitantly agreed after complainant had insisted.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Complainant picked her up at Starbucks 6750 in Makati City, and they proceeded to Café Juanita in Burgos Circle for dinner. Upon passing by Burgos Circle, respondent Pecaña saw respondent Judge Rubia’s car parked near Café Juanita.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>At about past 10:00 p.m., respondent Pecaña said that she saw respondent Judge Rubia together with some companions walking toward his car.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> She stepped out of the restaurant and greeted him. Complainant allegedly followed respondent Pecaña and so the latter was constrained to introduce complainant as an employee of Philippine Airlines to respondent Judge Rubia.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> After the introduction, respondent Judge Rubia went to his car and left. Complainant and respondent Pecaña returned to the restaurant to finish their food and pay the bill.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>Complainant drove respondent Pecaña back to Makati City. During the drive, complainant allegedly asked her help regarding the cases filed in court and inquired as to what she could give to respondent Judge Rubia because her lawyers instructed her to bribe him. Respondent Pecaña only said that respondent Judge Rubia does not accept money and that he is financially stable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>After the dinner, complainant allegedly kept on sending text messages to respondent Pecaña concerning her case filed in court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Respondent Pecaña admitted to the exchanges through text messages she had with complainant on August 8, 2010 regarding the filing of administrative case against her and respondent Judge Rubia.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>Respondent Pecaña denied being an advocate of Atty.

The filing of the administrative case against him was only to compel him to inhibit from the cases to seek a friendlier forum.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>Moreover, respondent Judge Rubia denied knowledge of any text messages exchanged between complainant and respondent Pecaña as well as any active advocacy in favor of opposing counsel, Atty. Zarate.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>As to the allegations of partiality concerning the orders he issued for the cases filed, respondent Judge Rubia argued that the best forum to ventilate complainant’s allegations was not through an administrative proceeding but through judicial recourse.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>Due to the gravity of the charges and the conflicting facts presented by the parties, the Office of the Court Administrator recommended the referral of the administrative complaint to a Court of Appeals Justice for investigation, report, and recommendation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>On September 12, 2011, this court issued a resolution referring the administrative complaint to a Justice of the Court of Appeals for investigation, report, and recommendation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> The complaint was assigned to Court of Appeals Associate Justice Samuel H.

Zarate alleged that he did not know respondents personally, and he was not closely associated with them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> He asserted that the records were replete with incidents where he and respondent Judge Rubia engaged in heated discussions on legal matters.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> He maintained that he did not foster any closeness or personal affinity with respondent Judge Rubia that would substantiate complainant’s allegations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>In addition, Atty. Zarate expressed his agreement with respondents’ narration of the events on the alleged dinner meeting.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> He argued that if the dinner meeting did take place, this incident should have been the ground for the motion for inhibition filed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br><br>Atty. Zarate stated that, granting arguendo that the dinner meeting happened, there was nothing “wrong, improper or illegal”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> about it.

Respondents Judge Rubia and Pecaña should be held administratively liable for their actions.<br><br>The findings of fact of an investigating justice must be accorded great weight and finality similar with the weight given to a trial court judge’s since an investigating justice personally assessed the witnesses’ credibility.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> However, this rule admits of exceptions.<br><br>In <i>J.

Among the circumstances which had been held to be justifiable reasons for the Court to re-examine the trial court or appellate court’s findings of facts are, when the interference made is manifestly mistaken; when the judgment is based on misapprehension of facts; and when the finding of fact of the trial court or appellate court is premised on the supposed absence of evidence and is contradicted by evidence on record.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br>These exceptions are applicable in this case. In disregarding the complainant’s testimony and relying on the testimony of Cortez, respondent Judge Rubia’s witness, Justice Gaerlan said:<br><br><blockquote>While respondents were able to present a witness to corroborate their version of the incident on all material points, complainant miserably failed on this regard. The Investigating Justice who had the untrammeled opportunity to observe the deportment and demeanor of the respondent’s witness, Rodel Cortez (Cortez) during the hearing finds his forthright narration of facts credible and rang with truth. The clear, candid and unmistakable declaration of Cortez that the incident that transpired along the sidewalk of Burgos Circle was just a chance encounter, <b>absent any ulterior motive for him to perjure</b>, swayed this Investigating Justice to believe that the dinner meeting between Judge Rubia and Barias did not [take] place. A testimony is credible if it bears the earmarks of truth and sincerity and has been delivered in a spontaneous, natural, and straightforward manner.<br><br>Not only that. Cortez’[s] testimony was likewise corroborated by other pieces of evidence, such as the Program of Meeting and the Attendance Sheet of the Rotary Club of Makati Southwest which tend to prove that at that particular date and time Judge Rubia was in a rotary meeting and was not dining with Rubia and Pecaña. These evidence, when taken together, debase the uncorroborated version of incident as narrated by Barias. Barias[’] self-serving declarations have no evidentiary value when ranged against the testimony of a credible witness on affirmative matters.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>We cannot agree with Justice Gaerlan’s assessment of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight given to their testimonies.<br><br>Justice Gaerlan placed too much importance on the testimony of Rodel Cortez, the Secretariat of the Rotary Club of Makati, Southwest Chapter, and qualified him as a “disinterested” witness.<br><br>A disinterested witness’ testimony is afforded evidentiary weight by his or her lack of interest in the outcome of the case. This lack of stake makes the disinterested witness’ testimony more believable. To actively take part in litigation as a party or a witness entails willingness to commit to the arduous and exacting nature of most judicial proceedings. The disinterested witness’ candor and submission to the proceedings before the court add credibility and believability to the content of his or her testimony.<br><br>To qualify a witness as truly disinterested, courts should analyze the circumstances that surround his or her testimony.<br><br>The record shows that the Rotary Club of Makati, Southwest Chapter, employed Rodel in 1989.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> He was appointed Secretariat in 1994 where respondent Judge Rubia was a former President and remains an active member.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup><br><br>The finding that respondent Judge Rubia is administratively liable could taint the reputation of the organization that the witness has been serving for more than 20 years. It would be a definite blow to the reputation of the Rotary Club of Makati, Southwest Chapter, if its former President were to be found guilty of the offenses that complainant imputed upon respondent Judge Rubia. The possibility of Rodel testifying in favor of respondent Judge Rubia as a result of his loyalty to the latter and the Rotary Club puts into question the characterization that he is disinterested.<br><br>The substance of Rodel’s narration of events should also be scrutinized.<br><br>Complainant alleged that the dinner meeting set among her, respondent Pecaña, and respondent Judge Rubia took place on March 3, 2010, as indicated in the investigation report of Justice Gaerlan. The record shows that the Investigating Justice accepted the formal offer of Exhibit A, which was complainant’s judicial affidavit establishing the date of the dinner as <b><i>March 3, 2010 in Café Juanita</i></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> Complainant also alleged in her complaint that respondent Judge Rubia came from Mandarin Hotel in Makati from the Rotary Club of Makati, Southwest Chapter meeting.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup><br><br>The testimony of Rodel and the evidence submitted by respondents alleged that the chance meeting of respondent Judge Rubia with complainant and respondent Pecaña took place on <b><i>March 10, 2010 on the side street of Burgos Circle in Bonifacio Global City, after the Rotary Club of Makati, Southwest Chapter meeting and dinner at Numa Restaurant, on their way to the parking lot</i></b>. This means that the testimony of and the evidence presented by Rodel do not disprove the occurrence of the dinner meeting as alleged by complainant, since the meeting of the Rotary Club and the dinner meeting alleged by complainant took place on different dates.<br><br>Assuming that the alleged chance meeting between complainant and respondent Judge Rubia took place on March 10, 2010 as alleged by respondents, this does not discount the veracity of complainant’s allegations. Both the Rotary Club of Makati, Southwest Chapter dinner and the dinner meeting alleged by complainant took place in the vicinity of Bonifacio Global City.

She said that respondent Judge Rubia would get angry after complainant had informed her that her lawyer might file an administrative case against them. Respondent Judge Rubia would not have had a reason to get upset because of the possibility of administrative liability if an innocent and coincidental encounter happened and not a dinner meeting. However, if the meeting took place as alleged by complainant, this would have logically led to a hostile reaction from respondents, particularly respondent Judge Rubia.<br><br>In her testimony before Justice Gaerlan, respondent Pecaña gave the following testimony:<br><br><blockquote>ATTY FERNANDEZ:<br><br>In August 2010, you admitted in your comment and your supplemental comment that you received a text coming from Emilie Barias saying her lawyer is mad with her because of that meeting, isn’t it?<br><br>EILEEN PECAÑA:<br><br>Yes, sir.<br><br>ATTY FERNANDEZ:<br><br>In fact you admitted that there were text messages coming from you and Judge Rubia in March 2010, isn’t it?<br><br>EILEEN PECAÑA:<br><br>Yes, sir.<br><br>ATTY FERNANDEZ:<br><br>And in fact, you admitted that there were [sic] indeed a text message coming from you and this is: [“]ha anong ipafile baka lalo tayong mapapahamk?[”] And another message says “bakit siya...another...did you do something to pacify her lawyer...so you affirm these message [sic]?<br><br>EILEEN PECAÑA:<br><br>Yes, sir.<br><br>ATTY FERNANDEZ:<br><br>Based on those messages of yours, is it correct that you fear....?<br><br>EILEEN PECAÑA:<br><br>I am not afraid in a way na pinalalabas nila.<br><br>ATTY.

Since complainant allegedly followed respondent Pecaña out of the restaurant, the latter introduced complainant to respondent Judge Rubia. This allegation is quite implausible after taking into account the following admissions:<br><br><ol><li>Respondent Pecaña described her relationship with Judge Rubia as “[w]ala naman po masyado.

In fact, after allegedly being repeatedly reminded that court employees should not have any dealings with litigants, respondent Pecaña should not have gone out to greet respondent Judge Rubia since she was dining with a litigant.<br><br>The odds that complainant and respondent Pecaña would meet respondent Judge Rubia by pure coincidence are highly improbable. Granted, chance meetings between persons may take place, but a chance meeting between a litigant in the company of a court employee who acceded to assisting the litigant in a case and the judge deciding that case is outside the realm of common experience. The odds of such an occurrence are, indeed, one in a million. The sheer improbability of such an occurrence already puts into question the truth of respondents’ allegations.<br><br>Based on these considerations, the narrative of complainant is more believable and must be afforded greater evidentiary weight.<br><br><b>Delay in filing of administrative complaint is not a defense</b><br><br>The investigation report placed particular emphasis on the eight-month period between the alleged dinner meeting and the filing of the administrative complaint. The eight-month delay in the filing of the administrative complaint is of no consequence.<br><br>Delay in filing an administrative complaint should not be construed as basis to question its veracity or credibility. There are considerations that a litigant must think about before filing an administrative case against judges and court personnel. This is more so for lawyers where the possibility of appearing before the judge where an administrative complaint has been filed is high.<br><br>Here, respondent Judge Rubia presided over three cases that involved complainant and her late husband’s estate. He wielded an unmistakable amount of control over the proceedings.<br><br>Filing an administrative case against respondents is a time-consuming ordeal, and it would require additional time and resources that litigants would rather not expend in the interest of preserving their rights in the suit. Complainant might have decided to tread with caution so as not to incur the ire of respondent Judge Rubia for fear of the reprisal that could take place after the filing of an administrative complaint.<br><br>Judges and court personnel wield extraordinary control over court proceedings of cases filed. Thus, litigants are always cautious in filing administrative cases against judges and court personnel.<br><br>In any case, administrative offenses, including those committed by members of the bench and bar, are not subject to a fixed period within which they must be reported. In <i>Heck v. Judge Santos</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup> this court held that:<br><br><blockquote>Pursuant to the foregoing, there can be no other conclusion than that an administrative complaint against an erring lawyer who was thereafter appointed as a judge, albeit filed only after <b>twenty-four years</b> after the offending act was committed, is not barred by prescription. If the rule were otherwise, members of the bar would be emboldened to disregard the very oath they took as lawyers, prescinding from the fact that as long as no private complainant would immediately come forward, they stand a chance of being completely exonerated from whatever administrative liability they ought to answer for. It is the duty of this Court to protect the integrity of the practice of law as well as the administration of justice. <b>No matter how much time has elapsed from the time of the commission of the act complained of and the time of the institution of the complaint, erring members of the bench and bar cannot escape the disciplining arm of the Court. This categorical pronouncement is aimed at unscrupulous members of the bench and bar, to deter them from committing acts which violate the Code of Professional Responsibility, the Code of Judicial Conduct, or the Lawyer’s Oath.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>If this court saw fit to penalize a member of the bench for an offense committed more than twenty years prior to the filing of the complaint, then the eight-month period cannot prejudice the complainant.<br><br>The interval between the time when the offense was committed and the time when the offense was officially reported cannot serve as a basis to doubt the veracity of complainant’s allegations.<br><br>This court’s mandate to discipline members of the judiciary and its personnel is implemented by pertinent rules and statutes. Judges are disciplined based on whether their actions violated the New Code of Judicial Conduct.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup> Court personnel are also governed by the Code of Conduct for Court Personnel<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup> and are appointed in accordance with the Civil Service Law, as provided for in Section 5, Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution. None of these rules for administrative discipline mandates a period within which a complaint must be filed after the commission or discovery of the offense. This court determines with finality the liability of erring members of the judiciary and its employees. The gravity of an administrative offense cannot be diminished by a delay in the filing of a complaint.<br><br>To dismiss the commission of the offense based on this eight-month period is to ignore the distinct and tangible possibility that the offense was actually committed. The commission of the offense is not contingent on the period of revelation or disclosure. To dismiss the complaint on this ground is tantamount to attaching a period of prescription to the offense, which does not apply in administrative charges.<br><br><b>Respondent Pecaña’s actions<br>amount to violations of the Code <br>of Conduct for Court Personnel </b><br><br>“Court personnel, regardless of position or rank, are expected to conduct themselves in accordance with the strict standards of integrity and morality.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup><br><br>The complaint states that respondents were allegedly acting in favor of Atty.

Because of respondents’ actions, complainant and all who will be made aware of the events of this case will harbor distrust toward the judiciary and its processes. For this alone, respondents should be held administratively liable.<br><br>For respondent Pecaña, the fact that she allowed herself to be placed in a position that could cause suspicion toward her work as a court personnel is disconcerting.<br><br>As a court employee, respondent Pecaña should have known better than to interact with litigants in a way that could compromise the confidence that the general public places in the judiciary. Respondent Pecaña should have refused to meet with complainant in her home. She should have refused any other form of extended communication with complainant, save for those in her official capacity as a Data Encoder of the court. This continued communication between complainant and respondent Pecaña makes her culpable for failure to adhere to the strict standard of propriety mandated of court personnel.<br><br>Respondent Pecaña admitted to meeting with complainant several times, despite the former’s knowledge of the pendency of cases in the court where she is employed and in addition to the text messages exchanged between them. She had a duty to sever all forms of communication with complainant or to inform her superiors or the proper authority of complainant’s attempts to communicate with her. Respondent Pecaña failed to do so. Instead, she continued to communicate with complainant, even to the extent of advising complainant against filing an administrative case against her and respondent Judge Rubia.<br><br>Respondent Pecaña violated Canon 1 of the Code of Conduct for Court Personnel:<br><br><blockquote><center><center>CANON I<br><br>FIDELITY TO DUTY<br></center></center><br>. . . .<br><br>SECTION 3.

Court personnel shall use the resources, property and funds under their official custody in a judicious manner and solely in accordance with the prescribed statutory and regulatory guidelines or procedures.</blockquote><br>Respondent Pecaña’s actions constitute a clear violation of the requirement that all court personnel uphold integrity and prudence in all their actions. As stated in <i>Villaros v.

Respondent Judge Rubia’s mere presence in the dinner meeting provides a ground for administrative liability.<br><br>In <i>Gandeza Jr. v. Tabin,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[142]</sup> this court reminded judges:<br><br><blockquote>Canon 2 of the Code of Judicial Conduct requires a judge to avoid not only impropriety but also the mere appearance of impropriety in <b>all activities</b>.<br><br>To stress how the law frowns upon even any appearance of impropriety in a magistrate’s activities, it has often been held that a judge must be like Caesar’s wife - above suspicion and beyond reproach. Respondent’s act discloses a deficiency in prudence and discretion that a member of the Judiciary must exercise in the performance of his official functions and of his activities as a private individual.

Judge Bersamira,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[144]</sup> this court explained the necessity of a judge’s integrity:<br><br><blockquote>By the very nature of the bench, judges, more than the average man, are required to observe an exacting standard of morality and decency. The character of a judge is perceived by the people not only through his official acts but also through his private morals as reflected in his external behavior. It is therefore paramount that a judge’s personal behavior both in the performance of his duties and his daily life, be free from the appearance of impropriety as to be beyond reproach. Only recently, in <i>Magarang v. Judge Galdino B. Jardin, Sr.,</i> the Court pointedly stated that:<br><br><blockquote>While every public office in the government is a public trust, no position exacts a greater demand on moral righteousness and uprightness of an individual than a seat in the judiciary. Hence, judges are strictly mandated to abide by the law, the Code of Judicial Conduct and with existing administrative policies in order to maintain the faith of the people in the administration of justice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[145]</sup></blockquote></blockquote><br>In <i>Castillo v. Judge Calanog, Jr.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[146]</sup> this court held:<br><br><blockquote>The Code of Judicial Ethics mandates that the conduct of a judge must be free of a whiff of impropriety not only with respect to his performance of his judicial duties, but also to his behavior outside his sala as a private individual. There is no dichotomy of morality: a public official is also judged by his private morals. The Code dictates that a judge, in order to promote public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary, must behave with propriety at all times. As we have recently explained, a judge’s official life can not simply be detached or separated from his personal existence. Thus:<br><br><blockquote>Being the subject of constant public scrutiny, a judge should freely and willingly accept restrictions on conduct that might be viewed as burdensome by the ordinary citizen.<br><br>A judge should personify judicial integrity and exemplify honest public service. The personal behavior of a judge, both in the performance of official duties and in private life should be above suspicion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[147]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote></blockquote><br>In <i>De la Cruz,</i> this court emphasized the need for impartiality of judges:<br><br><blockquote>. . . [A] judge should avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all his activities. A judge is not only required to be impartial; he must also <i>appear</i> to be impartial. x x x Public confidence in the judiciary is eroded by irresponsible or improper conduct of judges.<br><br>. . . In this connection, the Court pointed out in Joselito Rallos, et al. v. Judge Ireneo Lee Gako Jr., RTC Branch 5, Cebu City, that:<br><br><blockquote>Well-known is the judicial norm that “judges should not only be impartial but should also appear impartial.” Jurisprudence repeatedly teaches that litigants are entitled to nothing less than the cold neutrality of an impartial judge. The other elements of due process, like notice and hearing, would become meaningless if the ultimate decision is rendered by a partial or biased judge. Judges must not only render just, correct and impartial decisions, but must do so in a manner free of any suspicion as to their fairness, impartiality and integrity.<br><br><i><b>This reminder applies all the more sternly to municipal, metropolitan and regional trial court judges like herein respondent, because they are judicial front-liners who have direct contact with the litigating parties. They are the intermediaries between conflicting interests and the embodiments of the people’s sense of justice.

Zarate before Justice Gaerlan, Atty. Zarate stated that even if respondent Judge Rubia was present at the dinner meeting, it was merely an attempt to reconcile the parties and reach an extrajudicial solution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[149]</sup><br><br>This is telling of a culture of tolerance that has led to the decay of the exacting nature of judicial propriety. Instead of being outraged by respondent Judge Rubia’s meeting an opposing party, Atty. Zarate defended respondent Judge Rubia’s actions.<br><br>Had it been true that a settlement was being brokered by respondent Judge Rubia, it should have been done in open court with the record reflecting such an initiative.<br><br>As to complainant’s questioning of respondent Judge Rubia’s actions in the issuance of the orders in her pending cases and the exercise of his judgment, this court agrees that complainant should resort to the appropriate judicial remedies. This, however, does not negate the administrative liability of respondent Judge Rubia. His actions failed to assure complainant and other litigants before his court of the required “cold neutrality of an impartial judge.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[150]</sup> Because of this, respondent Judge Rubia also violated Canon 3 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct on Impartiality:<br><br><blockquote>CANON 3. IMPARTIALITY<br><br>Impartiality is essential to the proper discharge of the judicial office. It applies not only to the decision itself but also to the process by which the decision is made.<br><br>Section 1. Judges shall perform their judicial duties without favor, bias, or prejudice.<br><br>Section 2. Judges shall ensure that his or her conduct, both in and out of court, maintains and enhances the confidence of the public, the legal profession and litigants in the impartiality of the judge and of the judiciary.<br><br>Section 3. Judges shall, so far as is reasonable, so conduct themselves as to minimize the occasions on which it will be necessary for them to be disqualified from hearing or deciding cases.<br><br>Section 4. Judges shall not knowingly, while a proceeding is before, or could come before them, make any comment that might reasonably be expected to affect the outcome of such proceeding or impair the manifest fairness of the process. Nor shall judges make any comment in public or otherwise that might affect the fair trial of any person or issue.<br></blockquote><br>Complainant correctly cited <i>Pascual v. Judge Bonifacio</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[151]</sup> where this court held:<br><br><blockquote>Upon assumption of office, a judge becomes the visible representation of the law and of justice. Membership in the judiciary circumscribes one's personal conduct and imposes upon him a number of inhibitions, whose faithful observance is the price one has to pay for holding such an exalted position. Thus, a magistrate of the law must comport himself at all times in such a manner that his conduct, official or otherwise, can withstand the most searching public scrutiny, for the ethical principles and sense of propriety of a judge are essential to the preservation of the people's faith in the judicial system. This Court does not require of judges that they measure up to the standards of conduct of the saints and martyrs, but we do expect them to be like Caesar's wife in all their activities. Hence, we require them to abide strictly by the Code of Judicial Conduct.<br><br>It appears now that respondent has failed to live up to those rigorous standards. Whether or not he purposely went to the Manila Hotel on November 25, 1998 to meet complainant or only had a chance meeting with him, his act of trying to convince complainant to agree to his proposal is an act of impropriety. It is improper and highly unethical for a judge to suggest to a litigant what to do to resolve his case for such would generate the suspicion that the judge is in collusion with one party. A litigant in a case is entitled to no less than the cold neutrality of an impartial judge. Judges are not only required to be impartial, but also to appear to be so, for appearance is an essential manifestation of reality. Hence, not only must a judge render a just decision, he is also duty bound to render it in a manner completely free from suspicion as to its fairness and its integrity. Respondent's conduct in the instant case inevitably invites doubts about respondent's probity and integrity. It gives ground for a valid reproach. In the judiciary, moral integrity is more than a cardinal virtue, it is a necessity. Moreover, a judge's lack of impartiality or the mere appearance of bias would cause resentment if the party who refused the judge's proposal subsequently lost his case. It would give rise to suspicion that the judgment was "fixed" beforehand. Such circumstance tarnishes the image of the judiciary and brings to it public contempt, disrepute, and ridicule. Thus, we are constrained to rule that respondent violated Rule 2.01 of the Code of Judicial Conduct. His misconduct is not excused but rather made more glaring by the fact that the controversy involving complainant was pending in his own sala.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[152]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br>The totality of the actions of respondent Judge Rubia is a clear manifestation of a lack of integrity and impartiality essential to a judge.<br><br>By meeting with complainant, respondent Judge Rubia also violated Canon 4 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct:<br><br><blockquote>CANON 4. PROPRIETY<br><br>Propriety and the appearance of propriety are essential to the performance of all the activities of a judge.<br><br>Section 1. Judges shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all of their activities.<br><br>Section 2. As a subject of constant public scrutiny, judges must accept personal restrictions that might be viewed as burdensome by the ordinary citizen and should do so freely and willingly. In particular, judges shall conduct themselves in a way that is consistent with the dignity of the judicial office.<br><br>Section 3. Judges shall, in their personal relations with individual members of the legal profession who practice regularly in their court, avoid situations which might reasonably give rise to the suspicion or appearance of favoritism or partiality.</blockquote><br>On propriety, this court held in <i>Atty. Raul L. Correa v. Judge Medel Arnaldo Belen</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[153]</sup> that:<br><br><blockquote>Indeed, the New Code of Judicial Conduct for the Philippine Judiciary exhorts members of the judiciary, in the discharge of their duties, to be models of propriety at all times.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>A judge is the visible representation of the law. Thus, he must behave, at all times, in such a manner that his conduct, official or otherwise, can withstand the most searching public scrutiny. The ethical principles and sense of propriety of a judge are essential to the preservation of the people's faith in the judicial system.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[154]</sup></blockquote><br>Because of the meeting, and the subsequent orders issued after the meeting, respondent Judge Rubia violated the notions of propriety required of his office. Respondents have relentlessly stood by their position that the meeting was a chance encounter, and, thus, no impropriety could be attributed to the meeting itself.<br><br>Respondent Judge Rubia’s actions belittled the integrity required of judges in all their dealings inside and outside the courts. For these actions, respondent Judge Rubia now lost the requisite integrity, impartiality, and propriety fundamental to his office. He cannot be allowed to remain a member of the judiciary.<br><br>Respondents in this case failed to subscribe to the highest moral fiber mandated of the judiciary and its personnel. Their actions tainted their office and besmirched its integrity. In effect, both respondents are guilty of gross misconduct. This court defined misconduct as “a transgression of some established and definite rule of action, more particularly, unlawful behavior or gross negligence by a public officer.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[155]</sup> In <i>Camus v. The Civil Service Board of Appeals</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[156]</sup> this court held that “[m]isconduct has been defined as ‘wrong or improper conduct’ and ‘gross’ has been held to mean ‘flagrant; shameful’. . . . This Court once held that the word misconduct implies a wrongful intention and not a mere error of judgment.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[157]</sup><br><br>Both respondents are indeed guilty of gross misconduct. However, respondent Judge Rubia is also guilty of conduct unbecoming of a judge for violating Canons 2, 3, and 4 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct.<br><br>This is not to say that complainant comes to these proceedings with clean hands either. As a litigant, she is enjoined to act in such a way that will not place the integrity of the proceedings in jeopardy. Her liability, however, is not the subject of these proceedings. To ensure that these actions will no longer be committed by any party, respondents must be sanctioned accordingly, in keeping with the court’s mandate to uphold a character of trust and integrity in society.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the court resolved to redocket the case as a regular administrative matter. Respondent Judge Marino Rubia is hereby <b>DISMISSED</b> from the service, with corresponding forfeiture of all retirement benefits, except accrued leave credits, and disqualified from reinstatement or appointment in any public office, including government-owned or -controlled corporations. Respondent Eileen Pecaña is <b>SUSPENDED</b> for one (1) year for gross misconduct.<br><br>This decision is immediately executory.
