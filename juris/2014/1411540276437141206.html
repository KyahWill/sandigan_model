The information against them states:<br><br><blockquote>That on or about the 25<sup>th</sup> day of November, 2005, in the Municipality of San Gabriel, Province of La Union, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused VICTOR COGAED Y ROMANA and SANTIAGO DAYAO Y SACPA (who acted with discernment) and JOHN DOE, conspiring, confederating and mutually helping one another, did then there wilfully, unlawfully, feloniously and knowingly, without being authorized by law, have in their control, custody and possession dried marijuana, a dangerous drug, with a total weight of seventeen thousand, four hundred twenty-nine and six-tenths (17, 429.6) grams.<br><br>CONTRARY TO Section 11 (Possession of Dangerous Drugs), Article II, of Republic Act No. 9165 (otherwise known as the “Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002”).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></blockquote><br>The case was raffled to Regional Trial Court, Branch 28 of San Fernando City, La Union.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Cogaed and Dayao pleaded not guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>&nbsp; The case was dismissed against Dayao because he was only 14 years old at that time and was exempt from criminal liability under the Juvenile Justice and Welfare Act of 2006 or Republic Act No. 9344.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>&nbsp; Trial against Cogaed ensued.&nbsp; In a decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> dated May 21, 2008, the Regional Trial Court found Cogaed guilty.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the decision states:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Court finds accused Victor Cogaed y Romana GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt for Violation of Section 11, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 (otherwise known as the “Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002”) and sentences him to suffer life imprisonment, and to pay a fine of one million pesos (Php 1,000,000.00).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The trial court judge initially found Cogaed’s arrest illegal considering that “Cogaed at that time was not, at the moment of his arrest, committing a crime nor was shown that he was about to do so or that had just done so.&nbsp; He just alighted from the passenger jeepney and there was no outward indication that called for his arrest.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; Since the arrest was illegal, the warrantless search should also be considered illegal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>&nbsp; <i>However, the trial court stated that notwithstanding the illegality of the arrest, Cogaed “waived his right to object to such irregularity” <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> when “he did not protest when SPO1 Taracatac, after identifying himself, asked him to open his bag</i>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>Cogaed appealed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> the trial court’s decision.&nbsp; However, the Court of Appeals denied his appeal and affirmed the trial court’s decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>&nbsp; The Court of Appeals found that Cogaed waived his right against warrantless searches when “[w]ithout any prompting from SPO1 Taracatac, [he] voluntarily opened his bag.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>&nbsp; Hence, this appeal was filed.<br><br>The following errors were assigned by Cogaed in his appellant’s brief:<br><br><blockquote><center>I<br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN ADMITTING THE SEIZED DANGEROUS DRUGS AS EVIDENCE AGAINST THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT DESPITE BEING THE RESULT OF AN UNLAWFUL WARRANTLESS SEARCH AND SEIZURE.<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT DESPITE THE ARRESTING OFFICER’S NON-COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PROPER CUSTODY OF SEIZED DANGEROUS DRUGS UNDER REPUBLIC ACT NO. 9165.<br><br><center>III<br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT DESPITE THE ARRESTING OFFICER’S FAILURE TO PRESERVE THE INTEGRITY AND EVIDENTIARY VALUE OF THE SEIZED DANGEROUS DRUGS.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></blockquote><br>For our consideration are the following issues: (1) whether there was a valid search and seizure of marijuana as against the appellant; (2) whether the evidence obtained through the search should be admitted; and (3) whether there was enough evidence to sustain the conviction of the accused.<br><br>In view of the disposition of this case, we deem that a discussion with respect to the requirements on the chain of custody of dangerous drugs unnecessary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>We find for the accused.<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>The right to privacy is a fundamental right enshrined by implication in our Constitution.&nbsp; It has many dimensions.&nbsp; One of its dimensions is its protection through the prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures in Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution:<br><br><blockquote>The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures of whatever nature and for any purpose shall be inviolable, and no search warrant or warrant of arrest shall issue except upon probable cause to be determined personally by the judge after examination under oath or affirmation of the complainant and the witnesses he may produce, and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.</blockquote><br>This provision requires that the court examine with care and diligence whether searches and seizures are “reasonable.”&nbsp; As a general rule, searches conducted with a warrant that meets all the requirements of this provision are reasonable.&nbsp; This warrant requires the existence of probable cause that can only be determined by a judge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>&nbsp; The existence of probable cause must be established by the judge after asking searching questions and answers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>&nbsp; Probable cause at this stage can only exist if there is an offense alleged to be committed.&nbsp; Also, the warrant frames the searches done by the law enforcers.&nbsp; There must be a particular description of the place and the things to be searched.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>However, there are instances when searches are reasonable even when warrantless.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>&nbsp; In the Rules of Court, searches incidental to lawful arrests are allowed even without a separate warrant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup>&nbsp; This court has taken into account the “uniqueness of circumstances involved including the purpose of the search or seizure, the presence or absence of probable cause, the manner in which the search and seizure was made, the place or thing searched, and the character of the articles procured.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup>&nbsp; The known jurisprudential instances of reasonable warrantless searches and seizures are:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li><i>Warrantless search incidental to a lawful arrest</i> . . . ;<br><br></li><li>Seizure of evidence in “plain view,” . . . ;<br><br></li><li>Search of a moving vehicle. Highly regulated by the government, the vehicle’s inherent mobility reduces expectation of privacy especially when its transit in public thoroughfares furnishes a highly reasonable suspicion amounting to probable cause that the occupant committed a criminal activity;<br><br></li><li><i>Consented</i> warrantless search;<br><br></li><li>Customs search;<br><br></li><li><i>Stop and frisk</i>; and<br><br></li><li><i>Exigent and emergency circumstances</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></li></ol></blockquote><br><center>III<br></center><br>One of these jurisprudential exceptions to search warrants is “stop and frisk”.&nbsp; “Stop and frisk” searches are often confused with searches incidental to lawful arrests under the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup>&nbsp; Searches incidental to a lawful arrest require that a crime be committed<i> in flagrante delicto,</i> and the search conducted within the vicinity and within reach by the person arrested is done to ensure that there are no weapons, as well as to preserve the evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, “stop and frisk” searches are conducted to prevent the occurrence of a crime.&nbsp; For instance, the search in<i> Posadas v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> was similar “to a ‘stop and frisk’ situation whose object is either to determine the identity of a suspicious individual or to maintain the<i> status quo </i>momentarily while the police officer seeks to obtain more information.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup>&nbsp; This court stated that the “stop and frisk” search should be used “[w]hen dealing with a rapidly unfolding and potentially criminal situation in the city streets where unarguably there is no time to secure . . . a search warrant.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>The search involved in this case was initially a “stop and frisk” search, but it did not comply with all the requirements of reasonability required by the Constitution.<br><br>“Stop and frisk” searches (sometimes referred to as <i>Terry</i> searches<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup>) are necessary for law enforcement.&nbsp; That is, law enforcers should be given the legal arsenal to prevent the commission of offenses.&nbsp; However, this should be balanced with the need to protect the privacy of citizens in accordance with Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution.<br><br>The balance lies in the concept of “suspiciousness” present in the situation where the police officer finds himself or herself in.&nbsp; This may be undoubtedly based on the experience of the police officer.&nbsp; Experienced police officers have personal experience dealing with criminals and criminal behavior.&nbsp; Hence, they should have the ability to discern — based on facts that they themselves observe — whether an individual is acting in a suspicious manner.&nbsp; Clearly, a basic criterion would be that the police officer, with his or her personal knowledge, must observe the facts leading to the suspicion of an illicit act.<br><br>In <i>Manalili v. Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> the police officers were initially informed about a place frequented by people abusing drugs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup>&nbsp; When they arrived, one of the police officers saw a man with “reddish eyes and [who was] walking in a swaying manner.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup>&nbsp; The suspicion increased when the man avoided the police officers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup>&nbsp; These observations led the police officers to conclude that the man was high on drugs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup>&nbsp; These were sufficient facts observed by the police officers “to stop [the] petitioner [and] investigate.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>In <i>People v. Solayao</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> police officers noticed a man who appeared drunk.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup>&nbsp; This man was also “wearing a camouflage uniform or a jungle suit.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup>&nbsp; Upon seeing the police, the man fled.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup>&nbsp; His flight added to the suspicion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup>&nbsp; After stopping him, the police officers found an unlicensed “homemade firearm”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> in his possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup>&nbsp; This court ruled that “[u]nder the circumstances, the government agents could not possibly have procured a search warrant first.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup>&nbsp; This was also a valid search.<br><br>In these cases, the police officers using their senses observed facts that led to the suspicion.&nbsp; Seeing a man with reddish eyes and walking in a swaying manner, based on their experience, is indicative of a person who uses dangerous and illicit drugs.&nbsp; A drunk civilian in guerrilla wear is probably hiding something as well.<br><br>The case of Cogaed was different.&nbsp; He was simply a passenger carrying a bag and traveling aboard a jeepney.&nbsp; There was nothing suspicious, moreover, criminal, about riding a jeepney or carrying a bag.&nbsp; The assessment of suspicion was not made by the police officer but by the jeepney driver.&nbsp; It was the driver who signalled to the police that Cogaed was “suspicious.”<br><br>This is supported by the testimony of SPO1 Taracatac himself:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">COURT:</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Q </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">So you don’t know what was the content while it was still being carried by him in the passenger jeep?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">WITNESS:</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Not yet, Your Honor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>SPO1 Taracatac likewise stated:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">COURT:</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Q </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">If the driver did not make a gesture pointing to the accused, did you have reason to believe that the accused were carrying marijuana?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">WITNESS:</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">No, Your Honor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>The jeepney driver had to point to Cogaed.&nbsp; He would not have been identified by the police officers otherwise.<br><br>It is the police officer who should observe facts that would lead to a reasonable degree of suspicion of a person.&nbsp; The police officer should not adopt the suspicion initiated by another person.&nbsp; This is necessary to justify that the person suspected be stopped and reasonably searched.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup>&nbsp; Anything less than this would be an infringement upon one’s basic right to security of one’s person and effects.<br><br><center>IV<br></center><br>Normally, “stop and frisk” searches do not give the law enforcer an opportunity to confer with a judge to determine probable cause.&nbsp; In <i>Posadas v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> one of the earliest cases adopting the “stop and frisk” doctrine in Philippine jurisprudence, this court<i> approximated</i> the suspicious circumstances as probable cause:<br><br><blockquote>The <i>probable cause</i> is that when the petitioner acted suspiciously and attempted to flee with the buri bag there was a probable cause that he was concealing something illegal in the bag and it was the right and duty of the police officers to inspect the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>For warrantless searches, probable cause was defined as “a <b><i>reasonable ground of suspicion</i></b> supported by circumstances sufficiently strong in themselves to warrant a cautious man to believe that the person accused is guilty of the offense with which he is charged.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><br><i>Malacat v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> clarifies the requirement further.&nbsp; <b><i>It does not have to be probable cause, but it cannot be mere suspicion.</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> <b><i> It has to be a “genuine reason”</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> <b><i>to serve the purposes of the “stop and frisk” exception</i></b>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Other notable points of Terry are that while probable cause is not required to conduct a “stop and frisk,” it nevertheless holds that mere suspicion or a hunch will not validate a “stop and frisk.”<i> A genuine reason must exist, in light of the police officer’s experience and surrounding conditions, to warrant the belief that the person detained has weapons concealed about him</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, footnotes omitted)</blockquote><br>In his dissent for <i>Esquillo v.

There must then be a genuine reason to believe that the accused is armed and presently dangerous. Being an exception to the rule requiring a search warrant, a Terry protective search is strictly construed; hence, it cannot go beyond what is necessary to determine if the suspect is armed. Anything beyond is no longer valid and the fruits of the search will be suppressed.<br></blockquote>See also <i>Terry v.

No. 85177, August 20, 1990, 188 SCRA 751 [Per J. Gutierrez, Jr., Third Division]), we ruled that the accused were <i>in flagrante delicto </i>when the police searched their cargo at a checkpoint, and the accused were found to be transporting prohibited drugs. {761-762} The court delineated this from <i>Aminnudin </i>because in <i>Aminnudin,</i> the police had an opportunity to secure a warrant. {433} <i>Maspil </i>also relied on the doctrine in <i>People v. Tangliben</i> (263 Phil. 106 (1990) [Per J. Gutierrez, Jr., Third Division]) wherein the search was considered incidental to an <i>in flagrante delicto</i> arrest because of the “urgency” of the situation. {115}<br><br>Despite these doctrinal deviations, it is better if we follow the two-tiered test to determine if an individual is <i>in flagrante delicto</i>, which calls for his or her warrantless arrests.
