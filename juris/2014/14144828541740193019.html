				<BR><BR><br><br><div align="JUSTIFY">Before us is a petition for the issuance of a Writ of <i>Kalikasan</i> with prayer for the issuance of a Temporary Environmental Protection Order (TEPO) under Rule 7 of A.M. No. 09-6-8-SC, otherwise known as the <i>Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases</i> (Rules), involving violations of environmental laws and regulations in relation to the grounding of the US military ship <i>USS Guardian</i> over the Tubbataha Reefs.<br><br><center><b>Factual Background</b><br></center><br>The name “Tubbataha” came from the Samal (seafaring people of southern Philippines) language which means “long reef exposed at low tide.” Tubbataha is composed of two huge coral atolls – the north atoll and the south atoll – and the Jessie Beazley Reef, a smaller coral structure about 20 kilometers north of the atolls. The reefs of Tubbataha and Jessie Beazley are considered part of Cagayancillo, a remote island municipality of Palawan.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>In 1988, Tubbataha was declared a National Marine Park by virtue of Proclamation No. 306 issued by President Corazon C. Aquino on August 11, 1988. Located in the middle of Central Sulu Sea, 150 kilometers southeast of Puerto Princesa City, Tubbataha lies at the heart of the Coral Triangle, the global center of marine biodiversity.<br><br>In 1993, Tubbataha was inscribed by the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as a World Heritage Site. It was recognized as one of the Philippines’ oldest ecosystems, containing excellent examples of pristine reefs and a high diversity of marine life. The 97,030-hectare protected marine park is also an important habitat for internationally threatened and endangered marine species. UNESCO cited Tubbataha’s outstanding universal value as an important and significant natural habitat for <i>in situ</i> conservation of biological diversity; an example representing significant on-going ecological and biological processes; and an area of exceptional natural beauty and aesthetic importance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>On April 6, 2010, Congress passed Republic Act (R.A.) No. 10067,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> otherwise known as the “Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park (TRNP) Act of 2009” “to ensure the protection and conservation of the globally significant economic, biological, sociocultural, educational and scientific values of the Tubbataha Reefs into perpetuity for the enjoyment of present and future generations.”&nbsp; Under the “no-take” policy, entry into the waters of TRNP is strictly regulated and many human activities are prohibited and penalized or fined, including fishing, gathering, destroying and disturbing the resources within the TRNP.&nbsp; The law likewise created the Tubbataha Protected Area Management Board (TPAMB) which shall be the sole policy-making and permit-granting body of the TRNP.<br><br>The <i>USS Guardian</i> is an Avenger-class mine countermeasures ship of the US Navy. In December 2012, the US Embassy in the Philippines requested diplomatic clearance for the said vessel “to enter and exit the territorial waters of the Philippines and to arrive at the port of Subic Bay for the purpose of routine ship replenishment, maintenance, and crew liberty.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>&nbsp; On January 6, 2013, the ship left Sasebo, Japan for Subic Bay, arriving on January 13, 2013 after a brief stop for fuel in Okinawa, Japan.<br><br>On January 15, 2013, the <i>USS Guardian</i> departed Subic Bay for its next port of call in Makassar, Indonesia. On January 17, 2013 at 2:20 a.m. while transiting the Sulu Sea, the ship ran aground on the northwest side of South Shoal of the Tubbataha Reefs, about 80 miles east-southeast of Palawan. No one was injured in the incident, and there have been no reports of leaking fuel or oil.<br><br>On January 20, 2013, U.S. 7<sup>th</sup> Fleet Commander, Vice Admiral Scott Swift, expressed regret for the incident in a press statement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>Likewise, US Ambassador to the Philippines Harry K. Thomas, Jr., in a meeting at the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) on February 4, “reiterated his regrets over the grounding incident and assured Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert F. del Rosario that the United States will provide appropriate compensation for damage to the reef caused by the ship.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> By March 30, 2013, the US Navy-led salvage team had finished removing the last piece of the grounded ship from the coral reef.<br><br>On April 17, 2013, the above-named petitioners on their behalf and in representation of their respective sector/organization and others, including minors or generations yet unborn, filed the present petition against Scott H. Swift in his capacity as Commander of the US 7<sup>th</sup> Fleet, Mark A. Rice in his capacity as Commanding Officer of the <i>USS Guardian</i> and Lt. Gen. Terry G. Robling, US Marine Corps Forces, Pacific and <i>Balikatan</i> 2013 Exercises Co-Director (“US respondents”); President Benigno S. Aquino III in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), DFA Secretary Albert F. Del Rosario, Executive Secretary Paquito Ochoa, Jr., Secretary Voltaire T. Gazmin (Department of National Defense), Secretary Jesus P. Paje (Department of Environment and Natural Resources), Vice-Admiral Jose Luis M. Alano (Philippine Navy Flag Officer in Command, AFP), Admiral Rodolfo D. Isorena (Philippine Coast Guard Commandant), Commodore Enrico Efren Evangelista (Philippine Coast Guard-Palawan), and Major General Virgilio O. Domingo (AFP Commandant), collectively the “Philippine respondents.”<br><br><center><b><u>The Petition</u></b><br></center><br>Petitioners claim that the grounding, salvaging and post-salvaging operations of the <i>USS Guardian</i> cause and continue to cause environmental damage of such magnitude as to affect the provinces of Palawan, Antique, Aklan, Guimaras, Iloilo, Negros Occidental, Negros Oriental, Zamboanga del Norte, Basilan, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi, which events violate their constitutional rights to a balanced and healthful ecology. They also seek a directive from this Court for the institution of civil, administrative and criminal suits for acts committed in violation of environmental laws and regulations in connection with the grounding incident.<br><br>Specifically, petitioners cite the following violations committed by US respondents under R.A. No. 10067: unauthorized entry (Section 19); non-payment of conservation fees (Section 21); obstruction of law enforcement officer (Section 30); damages to the reef (Section 20); and destroying and disturbing resources (Section 26[g]).&nbsp; Furthermore, petitioners assail certain provisions of the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) which they want this Court to nullify for being unconstitutional.<br><br>The numerous reliefs sought in this case are set forth in the final prayer of the petition, to wit:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, Petitioners respectfully pray that the Honorable Court:<br><br></li><li>Immediately issue upon the filing of this petition a Temporary Environmental Protection Order (TEPO) and/or a Writ of Kalikasan, which shall, in particular,<br><br><ol type="a"><li>Order Respondents and any person acting on their behalf, to <u>cease and desist all operations</u> over the Guardian grounding incident;<br><br></li><li> Initially <u>demarcating the metes and bounds of the damaged area</u> as well as an additional buffer zone;<br><br></li><li>Order Respondents to <u>stop all port calls and war games under ‘<i>Balikatan</i></u>’ because of the absence of clear guidelines, duties, and liability schemes for breaches of those duties, and <u>require Respondents to assume responsibility for prior and future environmental damage in general, and environmental damage under the Visiting Forces Agreement in particular.</u><br><br></li><li>Temporarily <u>define and describe allowable activities</u> of ecotourism, diving, recreation, and limited commercial activities by fisherfolk and indigenous communities near or around the TRNP but away from the damaged site and an additional buffer zone;<br></li></ol><br></li><li>After summary hearing, issue a Resolution extending the TEPO until further orders of the Court;<br><br></li><li>After due proceedings, render a Decision which shall include, without limitation:<br><br><ol type="a"><li> <u>Order Respondents Secretary of Foreign Affairs</u>, following the dispositive portion of <i>Nicolas v.

(2) the petition is defective in form and substance; (3) the petition improperly raises issues involving the VFA between the Republic of the Philippines and the United States of America; and (4) the determination of the extent of responsibility of the US Government as regards the damage to the Tubbataha Reefs rests exclusively with the executive branch.<br><br><center><b><u>The Court’s Ruling</u></b><br></center><br>As a preliminary matter, there is no dispute on the legal standing of petitioners to file the present petition.<br><br><i>Locus standi</i> is “a right of appearance in a court of justice on a given question.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Specifically, it is “a party’s personal and substantial interest in a case where he has sustained or will sustain direct injury as a result” of the act being challenged, and “calls for more than just a generalized grievance.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> However, the rule on standing is a procedural matter which this Court has relaxed for non-traditional plaintiffs like ordinary citizens, taxpayers and legislators when the public interest so requires, such as when the subject matter of the controversy is of transcendental importance, of overreaching significance to society, or of paramount public interest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>In the landmark case of <i>Oposa v. Factoran, Jr.,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> we recognized the “public right” of citizens to “a balanced and healthful ecology which, for the first time in our constitutional history, is solemnly incorporated in the fundamental law.” We declared that the right to a balanced and healthful ecology need not be written in the Constitution for it is assumed, like other civil and political rights guaranteed in the Bill of Rights, to exist from the inception of mankind and it is an issue of transcendental importance with intergenerational implications. Such right carries with it the correlative duty to refrain from impairing the environment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>On the novel element in the class suit filed by the petitioners minors in <i>Oposa</i>, this Court ruled that not only do ordinary citizens have legal standing to sue for the enforcement of environmental rights, they can do so in representation of their own and future generations. Thus:<br><br><blockquote>Petitioners minors assert that they represent their generation as well as generations yet unborn. We find no difficulty in ruling that they can, for themselves, for others of their generation and for the succeeding generations, file a class suit. <b>Their personality to sue in behalf of the succeeding generations can only be based on the concept of intergenerational responsibility insofar as the right to a balanced and healthful ecology is concerned.</b> Such a right, as hereinafter expounded, considers the “rhythm and harmony of nature.”Nature means the created world in its entirety. Such rhythm and harmony indispensably include, <i>inter alia, </i>the judicious disposition, utilization, management, renewal and conservation of the country’s forest, mineral, land, waters, fisheries, wildlife, off-shore areas and other natural resources to the end that their exploration, development and utilization be equitably accessible to the present as well as future generations. Needless to say, every generation has a responsibility to the next to preserve that rhythm and harmony for the full enjoyment of a balanced and healthful ecology. Put a little differently, the minors’ assertion of their right to a sound environment constitutes, at the same time, the performance of their obligation to ensure the protection of that right for the generations to come.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>The liberalization of standing first enunciated in <i>Oposa,</i> insofar as it refers to minors and generations yet unborn, is now enshrined in the Rules which allows the filing of a citizen suit in environmental cases. The provision on citizen suits in the Rules “collapses the traditional rule on personal and direct interest, on the principle that humans are stewards of nature.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Having settled the issue of <i>locus standi,</i> we shall address the more fundamental question of whether this Court has jurisdiction over the US respondents who did not submit any pleading or manifestation in this case.<br><br>The immunity of the State from suit, known also as the doctrine of sovereign immunity or non-suability of the State,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> is expressly provided in Article XVI of the <u>1987 Constitution</u> which states:<br><br><blockquote>Section 3. The State may not be sued without its consent.</blockquote>In <i>United States of America v. Judge Guinto</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>we discussed the principle of state immunity from suit, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>The rule that a state may not be sued without its consent, now expressed in Article XVI, Section 3, of the 1987 Constitution, is one of the generally accepted principles of international law that we have adopted as part of the law of our land under Article II, Section 2. x x x.<br><br>Even without such affirmation, we would still be bound by the generally accepted principles of international law under the doctrine of incorporation. Under this doctrine, as accepted by the majority of states, such principles are deemed incorporated in the law of every civilized state as a condition and consequence of its membership in the society of nations. Upon its admission to such society, the state is automatically obligated to comply with these principles in its relations with other states.<br><br>As applied to the local state, the doctrine of state immunity is based on the justification given by Justice Holmes that “there can be no legal right against the authority which makes the law on which the right depends.”[<i>Kawanakoa v. Polybank,</i> 205 U.S. 349] There are other practical reasons for the enforcement of the doctrine. <b>In the case of the foreign state sought to be impleaded in the local jurisdiction, the added inhibition is expressed in the maxim <i>par in parem, non habet imperium</i>. All states are sovereign equals and cannot assert jurisdiction over one another. A contrary disposition would, in the language of a celebrated case, “unduly vex the peace of nations.” </b>[<i>De Haber v. Queen of Portugal</i>, 17 Q. B. 171]<br><br>While the doctrine appears to prohibit only suits against the state without its consent, it is <b>also applicable to complaints filed against officials of the state for acts allegedly performed by them in the discharge of their duties.</b> The rule is that if the judgment against such officials will require the state itself to perform an affirmative act to satisfy the same, such as the appropriation of the amount needed to pay the damages awarded against them, the suit must be regarded as against the state itself although it has not been formally impleaded. [<i>Garcia v. Chief of Staff,</i> 16 SCRA 120] In such a situation, the state may move to dismiss the complaint on the ground that it has been filed without its consent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>Under the American Constitution, the doctrine is expressed in the Eleventh Amendment which reads:<br><br><blockquote>The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.</blockquote>In the case of <i>Minucher v. Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> we further expounded on the immunity of foreign states from the jurisdiction of local courts, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>The <i>precept that a State cannot be sued in the courts of a foreign state</i> is a long-standing rule of customary international law then closely identified with the personal immunity of a foreign sovereign from suit and, with the emergence of democratic states, made to attach not just to the person of the head of state, or his representative, but also distinctly to the state itself in its sovereign capacity.<b> If the acts giving rise to a suit are those of a foreign government done by its foreign agent, although not necessarily a diplomatic personage, but acting in his official capacity, the complaint could be barred by the immunity of the foreign sovereign from suit without its consent. </b>Suing a representative of a state is believed to be, in effect, suing the state itself. The proscription is not accorded for the benefit of an individual but for the State, in whose service he is, under the maxim - <i>par in parem, non habet imperium</i> - thatall states are sovereign equals and cannot assert jurisdiction over one another. The implication, in broad terms, is that if the judgment against an official would require the state itself to perform an affirmative act to satisfy the award, such as the appropriation of the amount needed to pay the damages decreed against him, the suit must be regarded as being against the state itself, although it has not been formally impleaded.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>In the same case we also mentioned that in the case of diplomatic immunity, the privilege is not an immunity from the observance of the law of the territorial sovereign or from ensuing legal liability; it is, rather, an immunity from the exercise of territorial jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>In <i>United States of America v. Judge Guinto</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> one of the consolidated cases therein involved a Filipino employed at Clark Air Base who was arrested following a buy-bust operation conducted by two officers of the US Air Force, and was eventually dismissed from his employment when he was charged in court for violation of R.A. No. 6425. In a complaint for damages filed by the said employee against the military officers, the latter moved to dismiss the case on the ground that the suit was against the US Government which had not given its consent. The RTC denied the motion but on a petition for certiorari and prohibition filed before this Court, we reversed the RTC and dismissed the complaint. We held that petitioners US military officers were acting in the exercise of their official functions when they conducted the buy-bust operation against the complainant and thereafter testified against him at his trial. It follows that for discharging their duties as agents of the United States, they cannot be directly impleaded for acts imputable to their principal, which has not given its consent to be sued.<br><br>This traditional rule of State immunity which exempts a State from being sued in the courts of another State without the former’s consent or waiver has evolved into a restrictive doctrine which distinguishes sovereign and governmental acts <i>(jure imperii)</i> from private, commercial and proprietary acts (<i>jure gestionis</i>). Under the restrictive rule of State immunity, State immunity extends only to acts<i> jure imperii.</i>&nbsp; The restrictive application of State immunity is proper only when the proceedings arise out of commercial transactions of the foreign sovereign, its commercial activities or economic affairs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>In <i>Shauf v. Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> we discussed the limitations of the State immunity principle, thus:<br><br><blockquote><b>It is a different matter where the public official is made to account in his capacity as such for acts contrary to law and injurious to the rights of plaintiff.</b> As was clearly set forth by Justice Zaldivar in <i>Director of the Bureau of Telecommunications, et al. vs. Aligaen, etc., et al.</i>:&nbsp; “Inasmuch as the State authorizes only legal acts by its officers, unauthorized acts of government officials or officers are not acts of the State, and an action against the officials or officers by one whose rights have been invaded or violated by such acts, for the protection of his rights, is not a suit against the State within the rule of immunity of the State from suit. In the same tenor, it has been said that an action at law or suit in equity against a State officer or the director of a State department on the ground that, while claiming to act for the State, he violates or invades the personal and property rights of the plaintiff, under an unconstitutional act or under an assumption of authority which he does not have, is not a suit against the State within the constitutional provision that the State may not be sued without its consent.” The rationale for this ruling is that the doctrine of state immunity cannot be used as an instrument for perpetrating an injustice.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The aforecited authorities are clear on the matter. They state that <b>the doctrine of immunity from suit will not apply and may not be invoked where the public official is being sued in his private and personal capacity as an ordinary citizen</b>. The cloak of protection afforded the officers and agents of the government is removed the moment they are sued in their individual capacity. This situation usually arises where the public official acts without authority or in excess of the powers vested in him. It is a well-settled principle of law that <b>a public official may be liable in his personal private capacity for whatever damage he may have caused by his act done with malice and in bad faith, or beyond the scope of his authority or jurisdiction</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26] </sup>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>In this case, the US respondents were sued in their official capacity as commanding officers of the US Navy who had control and supervision over the <i>USS Guardian </i>and its crew. The alleged act or omission resulting in the unfortunate grounding of the <i>USS Guardian</i> on the TRNP was committed while they were performing official military duties. Considering that the satisfaction of a judgment against said officials will require remedial actions and appropriation of funds by the US government, the suit is deemed to be one against the US itself. The principle of State immunity therefore bars the exercise of jurisdiction by this Court over the persons of respondents Swift, Rice and Robling.<br><br>During the deliberations, Senior Associate Justice Antonio T. Carpio took the position that the conduct of the US in this case, when its warship entered a restricted area in violation of R.A. No. 10067 and caused damage to the TRNP reef system, brings the matter within the ambit of Article 31 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). He explained that while historically, warships enjoy sovereign immunity from suit as extensions of their flag State, Art. 31 of the UNCLOS creates an exception to this rule in cases where they fail to comply with the rules and regulations of the coastal State regarding passage through the latter’s internal waters and the territorial sea.<br><br>According to Justice Carpio, although the US to date has not ratified the UNCLOS, as a matter of long-standing policy the US considers itself bound by customary international rules on the “traditional uses of the oceans” as codified in UNCLOS, as can be gleaned from previous declarations by former Presidents Reagan and Clinton, and the US judiciary in the case of <i>United States v. Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines, Ltd.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>The <i>international law of the sea</i> is generally defined as “a body of treaty rules and customary norms governing the uses of the sea, the exploitation of its resources, and the exercise of jurisdiction over maritime regimes. It is a branch of public international law, regulating the relations of states with respect to the uses of the oceans.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; The UNCLOS is a multilateral treaty which was opened for signature on December 10, 1982 at Montego Bay, Jamaica. It was ratified by the Philippines in 1984 but came into force on November 16, 1994 upon the submission of the 60<sup>th</sup> ratification.<br><br>The UNCLOS is a product of international negotiation that seeks to balance State sovereignty (<i>mare clausum</i>) and the principle of freedom of the high seas (<i>mare liberum</i>).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> The freedom to use the world’s marine waters is one of the oldest customary principles of international law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> The UNCLOS gives to the coastal State sovereign rights in varying degrees over the different zones of the sea which are: 1) internal waters, 2) territorial sea, 3) contiguous zone, 4) exclusive economic zone, and 5) the high seas. It also gives coastal States more or less jurisdiction over foreign vessels depending on where the vessel is located.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Insofar as the internal waters and territorial sea is concerned, the Coastal State exercises sovereignty, subject to the UNCLOS and other rules of international law. Such sovereignty extends to the air space over the territorial sea as well as to its bed and subsoil.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>In the case of warships,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> as pointed out by Justice Carpio, they continue to enjoy sovereign immunity subject to the following exceptions:<br><br><blockquote><center><i>Article 30<br>Non-compliance by warships with the laws and regulations<br>of the coastal State</i><br></center><br>If any warship does not comply with the laws and regulations of the coastal State concerning passage through the territorial sea and disregards any request for compliance therewith which is made to it, the coastal State may require it to leave the territorial sea immediately.<br><br><i><center>Article 31<br>Responsibility of the flag State for damage caused by a warship<br>or other government ship operated for non-commercial purposes</center></i><br>The flag State shall bear international responsibility for any<b> loss or damage to the coastal State resulting from the non-compliance by a warship or other government ship operated for non-commercial</b> purposes <b>with the laws and regulations of the coastal State concerning passage through the territorial sea</b> or with the provisions of this Convention or other rules of international law.<br><br><center><i>Article 32<br>Immunities of warships and other government ships<br>operated for non-commercial purposes</i></center><br>With such exceptions as are contained in subsection A and in articles 30 and 31, nothing in this Convention affects the immunities of warships and other government ships operated for non-commercial purposes. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>A foreign warship’s unauthorized entry into our internal waters with resulting damage to marine resources is one situation in which the above provisions may apply.But what if the offending warship is a non-party to the UNCLOS, as in this case, the US?<br><br>An overwhelming majority – over 80% -- of nation states are now members of UNCLOS, but despite this the US, the world’s leading maritime power, has not ratified it.<br><br><blockquote>While the Reagan administration was instrumental in UNCLOS' negotiation and drafting, the U.S. delegation ultimately voted against and refrained from signing it due to concerns over deep seabed mining technology transfer provisions contained in Part XI. In a remarkable, multilateral effort to induce U.S. membership, the bulk of UNCLOS member states cooperated over the succeeding decade to revise the objectionable provisions. The revisions satisfied the Clinton administration, which signed the revised Part XI implementing agreement in 1994. In the fall of 1994, President Clinton transmitted UNCLOS and the Part XI implementing agreement to the Senate requesting its advice and consent.&nbsp; Despite consistent support from President Clinton, each of his successors, and an ideologically diverse array of stakeholders, the Senate has since withheld the consent required for the President to internationally bind the United States to UNCLOS.<br><br>While UNCLOS cleared the Senate Foreign Relations Committee (SFRC) during the 108th and 110th Congresses,&nbsp; its progress continues to be hamstrung by significant pockets of political ambivalence over U.S. participation in international institutions. Most recently, 111<sup>th</sup> Congress SFRC Chairman Senator John Kerry included “voting out” UNCLOS for full Senate&nbsp; consideration among his highest priorities. This did not occur, and no Senate action has been taken on UNCLOS by the 112<sup>th</sup> Congress.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></blockquote><br>Justice Carpio invited our attention to the policy statement given by President Reagan on March 10, 1983 that the US will “recognize the rights of the other states in the waters off their coasts, as reflected in the convention [UNCLOS], so long as the rights and freedom of the United States and others under international law are recognized by such coastal states”, and President Clinton’s reiteration of the US policy “to act in a manner consistent with its [UNCLOS] provisions relating to traditional uses of the oceans and to encourage other countries to do likewise.”&nbsp; Since Article 31 relates to the “traditional uses of the oceans,” and “if under its policy, the US ‘recognize[s] the rights of the other states in the waters <i>off their coasts</i>,’” Justice Carpio postulates that “there is more reason to expect it to recognize the rights of other states in their <i>internal waters, </i>such as the Sulu Sea in this case.”<br><br>As to the non-ratification by the US, Justice Carpio emphasizes that “the US’ refusal to join the UNCLOS was centered on its disagreement with UNCLOS’ regime of deep seabed mining (Part XI) which considers the oceans and deep seabed commonly owned by mankind,” pointing out that such “has nothing to do with its [the US’] acceptance of customary international rules on navigation.”<br><br>It may be mentioned that even the US Navy Judge Advocate General’s Corps publicly endorses the ratification of the UNCLOS, as shown by the following statement posted on its official website:<br><br><blockquote>The Convention is in the national interest of the United States because it establishes stable maritime zones, including a maximum outer limit for territorial seas; codifies innocent passage, transit passage, and archipelagic sea lanes passage rights; works against “jurisdictional creep” by preventing coastal nations from expanding their own maritime zones; and reaffirms sovereign immunity of warships, auxiliaries and government aircraft.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Economically, accession to the Convention would support our national interests by enhancing the ability of the US to assert its sovereign rights over the resources of one of the largest continental shelves in the world. Further, it is the Law of the Sea Convention that first established the concept of a maritime Exclusive Economic Zone out to 200 nautical miles, and recognized the rights of coastal states to conserve and manage the natural resources in this Zone.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></blockquote><br>We fully concur with Justice Carpio’s view that non-membership in the UNCLOS does not mean that the US will disregard the rights of the Philippines as a Coastal State over its internal waters and territorial sea. We thus expect the US to bear “international responsibility” under Art. 31 in connection with the <i>USS Guardian</i> grounding which adversely affected the Tubbataha reefs. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine that our long-time ally and trading partner, which has been actively supporting the country’s efforts to preserve our vital marine resources, would shirk from its obligation to compensate the damage caused by its warship while transiting our internal waters. Much less can we comprehend a Government exercising leadership in international affairs, unwilling to comply with the UNCLOS directive for all nations to cooperate in the global task to protect and preserve the marine environment as provided in Article 197, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote><center><i>Article 197<br>Cooperation on a global or regional basis</i></center><br>States shall cooperate on a global basis and, as appropriate, on a regional basis, directly or through competent international organizations, in formulating and elaborating international rules, standards and recommended practices and procedures consistent with this Convention, for the protection and preservation of the marine environment, taking into account characteristic regional features.</blockquote><br>In fine, the relevance of UNCLOS provisions to the present controversy is beyond dispute. Although the said treaty upholds the immunity of warships from the jurisdiction of Coastal States while navigating the latter’s territorial sea, the flag States shall be required to leave the territorial sea immediately if they flout the laws and regulations of the Coastal State, and they will be liable for damages caused by their warships or any other government vessel operated for non-commercial purposes under Article 31.<br><br>Petitioners argue that there is a waiver of immunity from suit found in the VFA. Likewise, they invoke federal statutes in the US under which agencies of the US have statutorily waived their immunity to any action. Even under the common law tort claims, petitioners asseverate that the US respondents are liable for negligence, trespass and nuisance.<br><br>We are not persuaded.<br><br>The VFA is an agreement which defines the treatment of United States troops and personnel visiting the Philippines to promote “common security interests” between the US and the Philippines in the region. It provides for the guidelines to govern such visits of military personnel, and further defines the rights of the United States and the Philippine government in the matter of criminal jurisdiction, movement of vessel and aircraft, importation and exportation of equipment, materials and supplies.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> The invocation of US federal tort laws and even common law is thus improper considering that it is the VFA which governs disputes involving US military ships and crew navigating Philippine waters in pursuance of the objectives of the agreement.<br><br>As it is, the waiver of State immunity under the VFA pertains only to criminal jurisdiction and not to special civil actions such as the present petition for issuance of a writ of <i>Kalikasan.</i> In fact, it can be inferred from Section 17, Rule 7 of the <u>Rules</u> that a criminal case against a person charged with a violation of an environmental law is to be filed separately:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 17. <i>Institution of separate actions.</i>—The filing of a petition for the issuance of the writ of <i>kalikasan </i>shall not preclude the filing of separate civil, criminal or administrative actions.</blockquote><br>In any case, it is our considered view thata ruling on the application or non-application of criminal jurisdiction provisions of the VFA to US personnel who may be found responsible for the grounding of the <i>USS Guardian,</i> would be premature and beyond the province of a petition for a writ of <i>Kalikasan</i>. We also find it unnecessary at this point to determine whether such waiver of State immunity is indeed absolute. In the same vein, we cannot grant damages which have resulted from the violation of environmental laws. The <u>Rules</u> allows the recovery of damages, including the collection of administrative fines under R.A. No. 10067, in a separate civil suit or that deemed instituted with the criminal action charging the same violation of an environmental law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Section 15, Rule 7 enumerates the reliefs which may be granted in a petition for issuance of a writ of <i>Kalikasan</i>, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 15. <i>Judgment.</i>—Within sixty (60) days from the time the petition is submitted for decision, the court shall render judgment granting or denying the privilege of the writ of <i>kalikasan</i>.<br><br>The reliefs that may be granted under the writ are the following:<br><br>(a) Directing respondent to permanently cease and desist from committing acts or neglecting the performance of a duty in violation of environmental laws resulting in environmental destruction or damage;<br><br>(b) Directing the respondent public official, government agency, private person or entity to protect, preserve,rehabilitate or restore the environment;<br><br>(c) Directing the respondent public official, government agency, private person or entity to monitor strict compliance with the decision and orders of the court;<br><br>(d) Directing the respondent public official, government agency, or private person or entity to make periodic reports on the execution of the final judgment; and<br><br>(e) Such other reliefs which relate to the right of the people to a balanced and healthful ecology or to the protection,preservation, rehabilitation or restoration of the environment, <b>except the award of damages to individual petitioners</b>. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>We agree with respondents (Philippine officials) in asserting that this petition has become moot in the sense that the salvage operation sought to be enjoined or restrained had already been accomplished when petitioners sought recourse from this Court. But insofar as the directives to Philippine respondents to protect and rehabilitate the coral reef structure and marine habitat adversely affected by the grounding incident are concerned, petitioners are entitled to these reliefs notwithstanding the completion of the removal of the <i>USS Guardian</i> from the coral reef.<br><br>However, we are mindful of the fact that the US and Philippine governments both expressed readiness to negotiate and discuss the matter of compensation for the damage caused by the <i>USS Guardian.</i> The US Embassy has also declared it is closely coordinating with local scientists and experts in assessing the extent of the damage and appropriate methods of rehabilitation.<br><br>Exploring avenues for settlement of environmental cases is not proscribed by the <u>Rules</u>. As can be gleaned from the following provisions, mediation and settlement are available for the consideration of the parties, and which dispute resolution methods are encouraged by the court, to wit:<br><br><center><b>RULE 3</b><br></center><br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>Sec. 3. <i>Referral to mediation</i>.–At the start of the pre-trial conference, the court shall inquire from the parties if they have settled the dispute; otherwise, the court shall immediately refer the parties or their counsel, if authorized by their clients, to the Philippine Mediation Center (PMC) unit for purposes of mediation.

After spending $6.5 million restoring the coral reef, the US government was reported to have paid the State of Hawaii $8.5 million in settlement over coral reef damage caused by the grounding.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>To underscore that the US government is prepared to pay appropriate compensation for the damage caused by the <i>USS Guardian</i> grounding, the US Embassy in the Philippines has announced the formation of a US interdisciplinary scientific team which will “initiate discussions with the Government of the Philippines to review coral reef rehabilitation options in Tubbataha, based on assessments by Philippine-based marine scientists.” The US team intends to “help assess damage and remediation options, in coordination with the Tubbataha Management Office, appropriate Philippine government entities, non-governmental organizations, and scientific experts from Philippine universities.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>A rehabilitation or restoration program to be implemented at the cost of the violator is also a major relief that may be obtained under a judgment rendered in a citizens’ suit under the <u>Rules</u>, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote><center><b>RULE 5</b><br></center><br>Section 1. <i>Reliefs in a citizen suit</i>.–If warranted, the court may grant to the plaintiff proper reliefs which shall include the protection, preservation or rehabilitation of the environment and the payment of attorney’s fees, costs of suit and other litigation expenses.

Hon. Santamaria</i> in the following manner:<br><br><blockquote>This Court explained the doctrine of sovereign immunity in <i>Holy See v. Rosario,</i> to wit:<br><br><blockquote>There are two conflicting concepts of sovereign immunity, each <b>widely held and firmly established. According to the classical or absolute</b> theory, a sovereign cannot, without its consent, be made a respondent in the courts of another sovereign. According to the newer or restrictive theory, the immunity of the sovereign is recognized only with regard to public acts or acts jure imperii of a state, but not with regard to private acts or acts jure gestionis.<br><br>x x x x</blockquote>The restrictive theory came about because of the entry of sovereign states into purely commercial activities remotely connected with the discharge of governmental functions.

The view evolved that the existence of a contract does not, per se, mean that sovereign states may, at all times, be sued in local courts. The complexity of relationships between sovereign states, brought about by their increasing commercial activities, mothered a more restrictive application of the doctrine.<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>As it stands now, the application of the doctrine of immunity from suit has been restricted to sovereign or governmental activities (jure imperii)</b>. The mantle of state immunity cannot be extended to commercial, private and proprietary acts (jure gestionis).<br><br>Since the Philippines adheres to the restrictive theory, it is crucial to ascertain the legal nature of the act involved – <b>whether the entity claiming immunity performs governmental, as opposed to proprietary, functions</b>. As held in <i>United States of America v. Ruiz</i> –<br><br>The restrictive application of State immunity is proper only when the proceedings arise out of commercial transactions of the foreign sovereign, its commercial activities or economic affairs. Stated differently, a State may be said to have descended to the level of an individual and can thus be deemed to have tacitly given its consent to be sued only when it enters into business contracts. It does not apply where the contract relates to the exercise of its sovereign functions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> (Emphases supplied. Citations omitted)</blockquote><br>From the Philippine perspective, what determines its ability to impose its law upon the foreign entity would be the act of the foreign entity – on whether the act is an aspect of its sovereign function or a private act.<br><br>In this case, the two Naval Officers were acting pursuant to their function as the commanding officers of a warship, traversing Philippine waters under the authority of the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA). While the events beg the question of what the warship was doing in that area, when it should have been headed towards Indonesia, its presence in Philippine waters is not wholly unexplainable. The VFA is a treaty, and it has been affirmed as valid by this Court in <i>Bayan v. Zamora</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and affirmed in <i>Lim v. Executive Secretary</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and <i>Nicolas v. Romulo.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>&nbsp; It has, in the past, been used to justify the presence of United States Armed Forces in the Philippines. In this respect therefore, acts done pursuant to the VFA take the nature of governmental acts, since both the United States and Philippine governments recognize the VFA as a treaty with corresponding obligations, and the presence of these two Naval Officers and the warship in Philippine waters fell under this legal regime.<br><br>From this, the applicability of sovereign immunity cannot be denied as to the presence of the warship and its officers in Philippine waters. This does not, however, put an end to the discussion, because even if immunity is applicable to their presence, the specific act of hitting the Tubbataha Reef and causing damage thereto is a presumably tortuous act. Can these kinds of acts also be covered by the principle of sovereign immunity?<br><br><b>TORT EXCEPTION</b><br><br>Under the regime of international law, there is an added dimension to sovereign immunity exceptions: the tort exception. Whether this has evolved into a customary norm is still debatable; what is important to emphasize is that while some states have enacted legislation to allow the piercing of sovereign immunity in tortuous actions, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 of the United States (FSIA)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> contains such privilege. Specifically, the FSIA contains exceptions for (1) waiver;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> (2) commercial activity;<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[7]</sup></font> (3) expropriation;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> (4) property rights acquired through succession or donation;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> (5) damages for personal injury or death or damage to or loss of property;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> (6) enforcement of an arbitration agreement;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> (7) torture, extrajudicial killing, aircraft sabotage, hostage taking, or the provision of material support to such an act, if the state sponsors terrorism;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> and (8) maritime lien in a suit for admiralty based on commercial activity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Any claim under the FSIA goes through a hierarchical process between the diplomatic channels of the United States and the forum state. However, by explicitly including the tort exception in its local legislation under the 4<sup>th</sup> exception discussed above - with due consideration to the heavy requirements for any doctrine to attain customary status - it becomes plausible that the exception can be applied to the United States, if not through customary international law, then by reason of acquiescence or estoppel.<br><br>As explained by Jasper Finke,<br><br><blockquote>x x x x the current state practice may not support a rule of customary international&nbsp; law&nbsp; according&nbsp; to&nbsp; which&nbsp; states&nbsp; must&nbsp; deny sovereign immunity in case of tortious acts committed by another country in the forum state. Even though such an obligation is included in the ECSI and the UNCJIS, a considerable number of states do not apply this exception. But this does not answer the question whether states are prohibited from doing so. Section 1605 of the FSIA, for example, denies immunity in cases ‘in which money damages are sought … for personal injury or death, or damage to or loss of property, occurring in the United States and caused by the tortious act or omission of that foreign state’. If sovereign immunity is the default rule and all exceptions must reflect customary international law, and if the tort exception has not yet evolved into custom, then states such as the US, UK, Canada, and Australia that have included the tort exception in their national immunity laws automatically violate international law – a conclusion which no commentator so far has suggested. <b>But if states that enact this exception as law do not violate international law, why then should a state do so if its courts apply this exception not on the basis of national law, but on the basis of how they construe and interpret the doctrine of sovereign immunity under international law?</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>What Finke suggests is that a local court need not find the tort exception concept in its national law if it can interpret the doctrine from its understanding of international law. Can the Philippines then interpret the exception as being part of its acceptance of “general principles of international law” under the Constitution?<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br><b>SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY AS A POLITICAL DECISION</b><br><br>In <i>Vinuya v. Romulo</i>, we stated that “the question whether the Philippine government should espouse claims of its nationals against a foreign government is a foreign relations matter, the authority for which is demonstrably committed by our Constitution not to the courts but to the political branches.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Immunity then, unlike in other jurisdictions, is determined not by the courts of law but by the executive branches. Indeed, this was extensively discussed in Chief Justice Puno’s concurring opinion in <i>Liang v. People</i>, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Petitioner's argument that a determination by the Department of Foreign Affairs that he is entitled to diplomatic immunity is a political question binding on the courts, is anchored on the ruling enunciated in the case of <i>WHO, et al. vs. Aquino, et al.,</i> viz:<br><br><blockquote><b>“It is a recognized principle of international law and under our system of separation of powers that diplomatic immunity is essentially a political question and courts should refuse to look beyond a determination by the executive branch of the government, </b>and where the plea of diplomatic immunity is recognized and affirmed by the executive branch of the government as in the case at bar, it is then the duty of the courts to accept the claim of immunity upon appropriate suggestion by the principal law officer of the government, the Solicitor General in this case, or other officer acting under his direction. <b>Hence, in adherence to the settled principle that courts may not so exercise their jurisdiction by seizure and detention of property, as to embarrass the executive arm of the government in conducting foreign relations, it is accepted doctrine that in such cases the judicial department of the government follows the action of the political branch and will not embarrass the latter by assuming an antagonistic jurisdiction.”</b></blockquote><br>This ruling was reiterated in the subsequent cases of <i>International Catholic Migration Commission vs. Calleja</i>; <i>The Holy See vs. Rosario, Jr; Lasco vs. UN; </i>and <i>DFA vs. NLRC.</i><br><br>The case of <i>WHO vs. Aquino</i> involved the search and seizure of personal effects of petitioner Leonce Verstuyft, an official of the WHO. Verstyft was certified to be entitled to diplomatic immunity pursuant to the Host Agreement executed between the Philippines and the WHO.<br><br><i>ICMC vs. Calleja</i> concerned a petition for certification election filed against ICMC and IRRI. As international organizations, ICMC and IRRI were declared to possess diplomatic immunity. It was held that they are not subject to local jurisdictions. It was ruled that the exercise of jurisdiction by the Department of Labor over the case would defeat the very purpose of immunity, which is to shield the affairs of international organizations from political pressure or control by the host country and to ensure the unhampered performance of their functions.<br><br>In <i>Holy See v. Rosario, Jr</i>. involved an action for annulment of sale of land against the Holy See, as represented by the Papal Nuncio. The Court upheld the petitioner’s defense of sovereign immunity. It ruled that where a diplomatic envoy is granted immunity from the civil and administrative jurisdiction of the receiving state over any real action relating to private immovable property situated in the territory of the receiving state, which the envoy holds on behalf of the sending state for the purposes of the mission, with all the more reason should immunity be recognized as regards the sovereign itself, which in that case is the Holy See.<br><br>In <i>Lasco vs. United Nations,</i> the United Nations Revolving Fund for Natural Resources Exploration was sued before the NLRC for illegal dismissal. The Court again upheld the doctrine of diplomatic immunity invoked by the Fund.<br><br>Finally, <i>DFA v. NLRC</i> involved an illegal dismissal case filed against the Asian Development Bank. Pursuant to its Charter and the Headquarters Agreement, the diplomatic immunity of the Asian Development Bank was recognized by the Court.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Clearly, the most important immunity to an international official, in the discharge of his international functions, is immunity from local jurisdiction. There is no argument in doctrine or practice with the principle that an international official is independent of the jurisdiction of the local authorities for his official acts. Those acts are not his, but are imputed to the organization, and without waiver the local courts cannot hold him liable for them. In strict law, it would seem that even the organization itself could have no right to waive an official's immunity for his official acts. This permits local authorities to assume jurisdiction over and individual for an act which is not, in the wider sense of the term, his act at all. It is the organization itself, as a juristic person, which should waive its own immunity and appear in court, not the individual, except insofar as he appears in the name of the organization. Provisions for immunity from jurisdiction for official acts appear, aside from the aforementioned treatises, in the constitution of most modern international organizations. The acceptance of the principle is sufficiently widespread to be regarded as declaratory of international law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>In this view, the prudent interpretation of the tort exception would be to allow the executive branch to first determine whether diplomatic or sovereign immunity can be invoked by the foreign officials involved. If it can be invoked, then the next analysis should be whether this invoked immunity is absolute, as in the treatment of diplomatic envoys. If it is not absolute, then and only then can the Court weave the tort exception into the law of sovereign immunity and thus attain jurisdiction over the Naval Officers involved. This is important because the practice has been to afford the foreign entity absolute immunity, but withdraw the same from its personnel when they commit private acts.<br><br><b>SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW</b><br><br>The basic concept of state immunity is that no state may be subjected to the jurisdiction of another state without its consent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> According to Professor Ian Brownlie, it is “a procedural bar (not a substantive defence) based on the status and functions of the state or official in question.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; Furthermore, its applicability depends on the law and procedural rules of the forum state.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> In the recent judgment of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (<i>Germany v. Italy:</i> Greece Intervening) case,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> the doctrine of sovereign immunity was applied in the following context:<br><br>In 1995, successors in title of the victims of the Distomo massacre, committed by the German armed forces in a Greek village in June 1944, brought proceedings for compensation against Germany before the Greek courts. The Greek court ordered Germany to pay compensation to the claimants. The appeal by Germany against that judgment was dismissed by a decision of the Hellenic Supreme Court, which ordered Germany to pay the costs of the appeal proceedings. The successful Greek claimants under the first-instance and Supreme Court judgments applied to the Italian courts for <i>exequatur</i> of those judgments, so as to be able to have them enforced in Italy. This was allowed by the Florence Court of Appeal and confirmed by the Italian Court of Cassation.<br><br>Germany raised the dispute before the ICJ, claiming these decisions constituted violations of its jurisdictional immunity.<br><br>The ICJ analyzed the case from the vantage point of immunity, such that the jurisdictional immunity of states refers primarily to an immunity from the trial process and is thus preliminary in character, as stated in the following manner:<br><br><blockquote>At the outset, however, the Court must observe that the proposition that the availability of immunity will be to some extent dependent upon the gravity of the unlawful act presents a logical problem. <b>Immunity from jurisdiction is an immunity not merely from being subjected to an adverse judgment but from being subjected to the trial process</b>. It is, therefore, necessarily preliminary in nature. Consequently, a national court is required to determine whether or not a foreign State is entitled to immunity as a matter of international law before it can hear the merits of the case brought before it and before the facts have been established. If immunity were to be dependent upon the State actually having committed a serious violation of international human rights law or the law of armed conflict, then it would become necessary for the national court to hold an enquiry into the merits in order to determine whether it had jurisdiction. If, on the other hand, the mere allegation that the State had committed such wrongful acts were to be sufficient to deprive the State of its entitlement to immunity, immunity could, in effect be negated simply by skilful construction of the claim.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The ICJ continued dissecting national law in order to determine whether jurisdictional immunity could be defeated by reason of serious violations of human rights law or the law of armed conflict. In this, the ICJ clearly saw that there was no customary international law norm that led to the defeat of immunity by reason of these violations, including the tort exception, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>Apart from the decisions of the Italian courts which are the subject of the present proceedings, there is almost no State practice which might be considered to support the proposition that a State is deprived of its entitlement to immunity in such a case. Although the Hellenic Supreme Court in the Distomo case adopted a form of that proposition, the Special Supreme Court in Margellos repudiated that approach two years later. As the Court has noted in paragraph 76 above, under Greek law it is the stance adopted in Margellos which must be followed in later cases unless the Greek courts find that there has been a change in customary international law since 2002, which they have not done. <b>As with the territorial tort principle, the Court considers that Greek practice, taken as a whole, tends to deny that the proposition advanced by Italy has become part of customary international law</b>.<br><br><b>In addition, there is a substantial body of State practice from other countries which demonstrates that customary international law does not treat a State’s entitlement to immunity as dependent upon the gravity of the act of which it is accused or the peremptory nature of the rule which it is alleged to have violated</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>As things stand in the international sphere, the immunity of the state (and by extension, its agents, in the performance of their governmental functions <i>jure imperii</i>) <b>must stand against even serious violations of international law</b>, including breaches of international environmental law (which is an aspect of human rights law as well). The ICJ concluded that<br><br><blockquote>x x x[U]nder customary international law as it presently stands, a State is not deprived of immunity by reason of the fact that it is accused of serious violations of international human rights law or the international law of armed conflict. In reaching that conclusion, the Court must emphasize that it is addressing only the immunity of the State itself from the jurisdiction of the courts of other States; the question of whether, and if so to what extent, immunity might apply in criminal proceedings against an official of the State is not in issue in the present case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></blockquote><br>This does not mean that the act of the state is to be considered lawful. However, this also does not mean that state immunity is waived in the context of an international breach of even a <i>jus cogens</i> norm, as explained in this manner:<br><br><blockquote>The rules of State immunity are procedural in character and are confined to determining whether or not the courts of one State may exercise jurisdiction in respect of another State. They do not bear upon the question whether or not the conduct in respect of which the proceedings are brought was lawful or unlawful. That is why the application of the contemporary law of State immunity to proceedings concerning events which occurred in 1943-1945 does not infringe the principle that law should not be applied retrospectively to determine matters of legality and responsibility (as the Court has explained in paragraph 58 above). For the same reason, recognizing the immunity of a foreign State in accordance with customary international law does not amount to recognizing as lawful a situation created by the breach of a <i>jus cogens</i> rule, or rendering aid and assistance in maintaining that situation, and so cannot contravene the principle in Article 41 of the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></blockquote><br><b>CONCLUSION OF JURISDICTIONAL ARGUMENTS AND IMMUNITY</b><br><br>What the Court is left to work with is a process by which jurisdiction and immunity can be determined by answering several questions, summated thusly:<br><br><ol><li>Is the act of the foreign national or entity an act <i>jure imperii</i>, such that it can be considered an act of state entitled to immunity, or an act <i>jure gestionis</i>, in which case it is to be considered a private act?<br><br></li><li>In respect of the above question, has the executive branch, in the exercise of its political power, determined whether absolute diplomatic immunity is applicable?<br><br></li><li>If it is an act <i>jure imperii</i> and thus entitled to sovereign immunity, does an exception apply to withdraw the immunity privilege of such acts?</li></ol><br>In this case, it is apparent that the act of the <i>U.S.S. Guardian</i> and its officers in entering Philippine waters is allowed by the VFA, and as a treaty privilege should be considered an act<i> jure imperii</i>. Its deviation into the waters of Tubbataha, and whether this can be considered a private act, is a factual issue that should be determined by the proper body. Indeed, while Philippine authorities may not have authorized the deviation, if the United States government affirms that it gave the <i>Guardian</i> sufficient discretion to determine its course, then the act is not necessarily robbed of its <i>jure imperii </i>character and is thus entitled to immunity. The course of action of the Philippine government would be to engage in diplomatic negotiations for potential treaty breach liability.<br><br>As of this moment, the executive branch has not made a determination of the applicable immunity. No correspondence has been sent to the Court as to the issue. Thus, the Court must act in deference to the executive prerogative to first make this determination under the presumption of regularity of performance of duties, before it can exercise its judicial power.<br><br>Finally, no exception&nbsp; exists in Philippine&nbsp; or international law that would remove the immunity of the United States in order to place it under the jurisdiction of Philippine courts. The Writ of <i>Kalikasan</i> is a compulsory writ, and its issuance initiates a legal process that would circumvent the internationally&nbsp; established&nbsp; rules of immunity. Should the Court issue the Writ, it could possibly entail international responsibility for breaching the jurisdictional immunity of a sovereign state.<br><br>I therefore vote to dismiss the Petition.<br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> G.R.

But this alone, as said above, did not constitute the common interest over the subject matter indispensable in a class suit.</b> . . .<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</blockquote><br>In a class suit, petitioners necessarily bring the suit in two capacities: first, as persons directly injured by the act or omission complained of; and second, as representatives of an entire class who have suffered the same injury.&nbsp; In order to fully protect all those concerned, petitioners must show that they belong in the same universe as those they seek to represent.&nbsp; More importantly, they must establish that, in that universe, they can intervene on behalf of the rest.<br><br>These requirements equally apply in environmental cases.<br><br>Petitioners who bring the suit both for themselves and those they seek to represent must share a common legal interest — that is, the subject of the suit over which there exists a cause of action is common to all persons who belong to the group.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>&nbsp; As a result, the right sought to be enforced is enjoyed collectively, and not separately or individually.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>&nbsp; The substantial injury must have been suffered by both the parties bringing the suit and the represented class.<br><br>However, it is recognized that any damage to the environment affects people differently, rendering it impossible for the injury suffered to be of the same nature and degree for each and every person.&nbsp; For instance, second-hand smoke from one who lights up a cigarette may cause lung and other health complications of a much graver degree to exposed commuters, compared to those who are kept insulated by well-maintained and well-ventilated buildings.&nbsp; The same may be said for dumpsites along the shores of a bay.&nbsp; The gravity of injury they cause to those whose source of livelihood is purely fishing in the affected area would be entirely different from that suffered by an office worker.<br><br>The differences in effects, ranging from miniscule to grave, increase the possibility of “free-riders” in a case.&nbsp; This results in a <i>negative externality</i>: an environmental management concept that delves into the effect of an individual’s or firm’s action on others.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>&nbsp; In this case, the effect on others is a disadvantage or an injury.<br><br>In most instances where this free-rider or negative externality exists, a suit is not filed because the cost of maintaining and litigating outweighs the actual damage suffered due to the act or omission of another.&nbsp; The theory is that bringing a class suit allows those who are not as affected as petitioners, though they may share the same interest, to latch their claim on someone else without any personal expense.&nbsp; There must be some assurances, however, that the interests are the same and the arguments that should have been brought by others who do not have the resources to bring the suit are properly represented.&nbsp; This is why the rules allow courts to be liberal in assessing “common interest.”<br><br>Another essential element of a class suit is that petitioners must be sufficiently numerous and representative so <i>as to fully protect the interest of all concerned</i>.&nbsp; One of the dangers of bringing a class suit is that while the parties’ environmental interest shares a common legal basis, the extent and nature of that interest differ depending on circumstances.<br><br>In the case of<i> Re: Request of the Plaintiffs, Heirs of the Passengers of the Doña Paz,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> which quoted Moore’s Federal Practice we noted:<br><br><blockquote>A <b><i>"true class action" </i></b>— <b><i>distinguished from the so-called hybrid and the spurious class action</i></b> in U.S. Federal Practice — “involves principles of compulsory joinder, since . . . (were it not) for the numerosity of the class members all should . . . (be) before the court. Included within the true class suit . . . (are) the shareholders' derivative suit and a class action by or against an unincorporated association. . . . <b><i>A judgment in a class suit, whether favorable or unfavorable to the class, is binding under res judicata principles upon all the members of the class, whether or not they were before the court. It is the non-divisible nature of the right sued on which determines both the membership of the class and the res judicata effect of the final determination of the right.”</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Those who bring class suits do so, carrying a heavy burden of representation.&nbsp; All the parties represented may not have consented to the agency imposed on them.<br><br>Courts, therefore, must ensure that the parties that bring the suit are sufficiently numerous to ensure that all possible interests and arguments have been considered.&nbsp; The community, class, group, or identity that is represented must be sufficiently defined so that the court will be able to properly assess that the parties bringing the suit are properly representative.<br><br>In view of the technical nature of some environmental cases, not only should the parties be representative in terms of the interests and arguments that they bring, they must likewise show that they have the capability to bring reasonably cogent, rational, scientific, well-founded arguments.&nbsp; This is so because if they purportedly represent a community, class, group, or identity, we should assume that all those represented would have wanted to argue in the best possible manner.<br><br>The cogency and representativeness of the arguments can readily be seen in the initiatory pleading.&nbsp; In the special civil actions invoked in this case, this court has the discretion to scrutinize the initiatory pleading to determine whether it should grant due course prior or after the filing of a comment.&nbsp; In my view, this pleading falls short of the requirement of representativeness.<br><br>For instance, it is clear in some of the reliefs that were requested that the arguments may not be what all those they purport to represent really want.&nbsp; As an illustration, the petition requests:<br><br><blockquote>3) for respondents to stop all port calls and war games under the Balikatan;</blockquote><br>The facts in this case and the writ of kalikasan certainly have no bearing on why this court should issue an injunction against all port calls in any part of the country made by all kinds of ships even if this is related to the Balikatan exercises.&nbsp; “War games” even undertaken solely on land has no bearing on the subject matter of this case.&nbsp; Also, in the facts as alleged in the pleading, it is not clear how all those affected by the ecological mishap that may have occurred in the Tubbataha Reefs would also be interested in stopping “war games under the Balikatan.”&nbsp; The pleading asserts that it represents all generations yet unborn.&nbsp; Thus, it includes the sons and daughters of all government officials who are now involved in the Balikatan exercises.&nbsp; It also includes the military commanders who are now administering such exercise.&nbsp; The broad relief requested belies the representativeness of the suit.<br><br>Of similar nature are the following prayers for relief in the petition:<br><br><blockquote>4) for respondents to assume responsibility for prior and future environmental damage in general and under the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA);<br><br>5) for the temporary definition of allowable activities near or around the Tubbataha Reefs [Natural] Park, but away from the damaged site and the additional buffer zone;<br><br>6) for respondent Secretary of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with the United States representatives for an agreement on environmental guidelines and accountability pursuant to the VFA;<br><br>. . . .<br><br>8) for the declaration of exclusive criminal jurisdiction of Philippine authorities over erring USS Guardian personnel;<br><br>. . . .<br><br>14) for the convention of a multisectoral technical working group that will provide scientific and technical support to the Tubbataha Protected Area Management Board (TPAMBl);<br><br>15) for respondents Department of Foreign Affairs, Department of National Defense, and the Department of Environmental and Natural Resources to review the VFA and the Mutual Defense Treaty in light of the right to a balanced and healthful ecology, and any violation related thereto;<br><br>16) for the declaration of the grant of immunity under Articles V and VI of the VFA as being violative of equal protection and/or the peremptory norm of nondiscrimination;<br><br>17) for permission to resort to continuing discovery measures</blockquote><br>Not all environmental cases need to be brought as class suits.&nbsp; There is no procedural requirement that majority of those affected must file a suit in order that an injunctive writ or a writ of kalikasan can be issued.&nbsp; It is sufficient that the party has suffered its own direct and substantial interest, its legal basis is cogent, and it has the capability to move forward to present the facts and, if necessary, the scientific basis for its analysis for some of these cases to be given due course.<br><br>Parenthetically, the humility of bringing suits only in the name of petitioners will protect them from the charge that more than the legal arguments they want to bring, they also want to impose their own political views as views which are universally accepted.<br><br><i>In all environmental cases, it is also not necessary that generations yet unborn be represented.</i>&nbsp; It is not also necessary that minors bring the suit. In my view, pleading their interests have no value added to the case except for its emotive effect at the risk of encouraging a paternal attitude toward our children and for those belonging to generations yet unborn.&nbsp; Certainly, it was not necessary with respect to the putative cause of action relating to the grounding of the <i>USS Guardian.</i><br><br>With the class suit improperly brought, the parties who filed this petition have no legal standing.&nbsp; To protect the individuals, families, and communities who are improperly represented, this case should be dismissed.<br><br><blockquote><center><b>III<br>A petition for a writ of kalikasan<br>is a wrong remedy</b></center></blockquote><br>Rule 7, Part III of the Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases pertaines to the writ of kalikasan.&nbsp; It describes the nature of the writ:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 1.</b> <i>Nature of the writ. </i>- <b><i>The writ is a remedy </i></b>available to a natural or juridical person, entity authorized by law, people’s organization, non-governmental organization, or any public interest <b><i>group accredited by or registered with any government agency, on behalf of persons whose constitutional right to a balanced and healthful ecology is violated, or threatened with violation by an unlawful act or omission</i></b> of a public official or employee, or private individual or entity, <b><i>involving environmental damage of such magnitude as to prejudice the life, health or property of inhabitants in two or more cities or provinces</i></b>. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The writ of kalikasan is a remedy that covers environmental damages the magnitude of which transcends both political and territorial boundaries.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup>&nbsp; It specifically provides that the prejudice to life, health, or property caused by an unlawful act or omission of a public official, public employee, or a private individual or entity must be felt in at least two cities or provinces.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup>&nbsp; The petition for its issuance may be filed on behalf of those whose right to a balanced and healthful ecology is violated, provided that the group or organization which seeks to represent is duly accredited.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>Two things must be examined: first, whether petitioners are qualified to bring this suit under the requirements of the provisions; and second, whether there are actual injured parties being represented.&nbsp; On the first issue, the following petitioners bring this case as individuals:<br></http:></http:></http:></http:></http:></http:></http:><ul><li><http: tubbatahareef.org=""><http: manila.usembassy.gov="" pressphotoreleases2013="" navy-commander-expresses-regret-concerning-uss-guardian-grounding.html=""><http: tubbatahareef.org=""><http: manila.usembassy.gov="" pressphotoreleases2013="" navy-commander-expresses-regret-concerning-uss-guardian-grounding.html=""><http: manila.usembassy.gov="" jointstatementguardiantubbataha.html=""><http: www.jag.navy.mil="" organization="" code="" 10="" law="" of="" the="" sea.htm=""><http: navysite.de="" cg="" cg73.html=""><http: www.navy.mil="" submit="" display.asp?story_id="42502"><http: www.hawaiinewsnow.com="" story="" 13974224="" navy-state-reach-settlement-on-uss-port-royal-reef-damage=""><http: manila.usembassy.gov="" usgtargetedassistancetubbataha.html="">Rev.

The rule that a <b><i>State may not be sued without its consent is a necessary consequence of the principles of independence and equality of States.</i></b> As enunciated in <i>Sanders v.

This divergence of opinion causes difficulties in international relations. States whose courts and administrative authorities apply the theory of absolute State immunity are led to call for the same treatment abroad.

Carpio ably points to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) as basis for the waiver of sovereign immunity in this case, on account of a warship entering a restricted area and causing damage to the TRNP reef system.&nbsp; This is based on a reading of Articles 31 and 32 of the UNCLOS, thus:<br><br><blockquote><i><center>Article 31</center></i><br><i>Responsibility of the flag State for damage caused by a warship or other government ship operated for non-commercial purposes</i><br><br>The flag State shall bear international responsibility for any loss or damage to the coastal State resulting from the non-compliance by a warship or other government ship operated for non-commercial purposes with the laws and regulations of the coastal State concerning passage through the territorial sea or with the provisions of this Convention or other rules of international law.</blockquote><br>This is, however, subject to Article 32 of the same treaty which provides:<br><br><blockquote><center><i>Article 32</i></center><br><i>Immunities of warships and other government ships operated for non-commercial purposes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i><br><br>With such exceptions as are contained in subsection A and in articles 30 and 31, nothing in this Convention affects the immunities of warships and other government ships operated for non-commercial purposes.</blockquote><br>I agree that the UNCLOS does provide an opening clarifying the “international responsibility” of the flag ship for non-compliance by a warship with the laws of a coastal State.&nbsp; However, because of Article 32 of the same treaty, it would seem that it should not be the only basis for this court to infer either a waiver by the United States or authority under international law for domestic courts to shape their own doctrines of sovereign jurisdictional immunity.<br><br><b>Other international agreements</b><br><br>The text of Article VII, Section 21 would seem to require Senate concurrence for treaties and “international agreements.”&nbsp; The term “international agreements,” however, for purposes of granting sovereign immunity, should not cover mere executive agreements.<br><br>We are aware of <i>Bayan Muna v. Romulo</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> where the ponente for this court held:<br><br><blockquote>. . . <b><i>International agreements may be in the form of (1) treaties that require legislative concurrence after executive ratification; or (2) executive agreements that are similar to treaties, except that they do not require legislative concurrence and are usually less formal and deal with a narrower range of subject matters than treaties.</i></b><br><br>Under international law, <b><i>there is no difference between treaties and executive agreements in terms of their binding effects on the contracting states concerned, as long as the negotiating functionaries have remained within their powers</i></b>. Neither, on the domestic sphere, can one be held valid if it violates the Constitution. Authorities are, however, agreed that one is distinct from another for accepted reasons apart from the concurrence-requirement aspect. As has been observed by US constitutional scholars, a treaty has greater "dignity" than an executive agreement, because its constitutional efficacy is beyond doubt, a treaty having behind it the authority of the President, the Senate, and the people; a ratified treaty, unlike an executive agreement, takes precedence over any prior statutory enactment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</blockquote><br>This statement, however, should be confined only to the facts of that case.&nbsp; Executive agreements are not the same as treaties as a source of international law.&nbsp; It certainly may have a different effect in relation to our present statutes unlike a treaty that is properly ratified.<br><br>Due to the nature of respondents' position in the United States Armed Forces, the Visiting Forces Agreement of 1998 (VFA) is relevant in this case.&nbsp; In particular, the question of whether the VFA, executed between the Republic of the Philippines and the United States government, may be treated as a "treaty" upon which the doctrine of foreign sovereign immunity is founded must be addressed.<br><br>In <i>BAYAN v.

"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup><br><br>As a preliminary issue, this court ruled that the Senate concurrence as required by the Constitution was achieved, thereby giving VFA a legally binding effect upon the government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup>&nbsp; However, the agreement's characterization as a "treaty" was put in question.&nbsp; This court held that despite the non-concurrence of the United States Senate, the VFA is validly categorized as a treaty:<br><br><blockquote>This Court is of the firm view that the <b><i>phrase "recognized as a treaty" means that the other contracting party accepts or acknowledges the agreement as a treaty</i></b>. To require the other contracting state, the United States of America in this case, to submit the VFA to the United States Senate for concurrence pursuant to its Constitution, is to accord strict meaning to the phrase.<br><br>Well-entrenched is the principle that the words used in the Constitution are to be given their ordinary meaning except where technical terms are employed, in which case the significance thus attached to them prevails. Its language should be understood in the sense they have in common use.<br><br><b><i>Moreover, it is inconsequential whether the United States treats the VFA only as an executive agreement because, under international law, an executive agreement is as binding as a treaty. To be sure, as long as the VFA possesses the elements of an agreement under international law, the said agreement is to be taken equally as a treaty.</i></b><br><br>A treaty, as defined by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, is "an international instrument concluded between States in written form and governed by international law, whether embodied in a single instrument or in two or more related instruments, and whatever its particular designation." There are many other terms used for a treaty or international agreement, some of which are: act, protocol, agreement, <i>compromis d’ arbitrage,</i> concordat, convention, declaration, exchange of notes, pact, statute, charter and <i>modus vivendi.</i> All writers, from Hugo Grotius onward, have pointed out that the names or titles of international agreements included under the general term treaty have little or no legal significance. Certain terms are useful, but they furnish little more than mere description.<br><br><b><i>Article 2(2) of the Vienna Convention provides that "the provisions of paragraph 1 regarding the use of terms in the present Convention are without prejudice to the use of those terms, or to the meanings which may be given to them in the internal law of the State.<br><br>Thus, in international law, there is no difference between treaties and executive agreements in their binding effect upon states concerned, as long as the negotiating functionaries have remained within their powers. International law continues to make no distinction between treaties and executive agreements: they are equally binding obligations upon nations.<br><br>In our jurisdiction, we have recognized the binding effect of executive agreements even without the concurrence of the Senate or Congress. . . .</i></b><br><br>. . . .<br><br>The records reveal that the United States Government, through Ambassador Thomas C. Hubbard, has stated that the United States government has fully committed to living up to the terms of the VFA. For as long as the United States of America accepts or acknowledges the VFA as a treaty, and binds itself further to comply with its obligations under the treaty, there is indeed marked compliance with the mandate of the Constitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</blockquote><br>Under the US legal system, however, an executive agreement, while legally binding, may not have the same effect as a treaty.&nbsp; It may, under certain circumstances, be considered as inferior to US law and/or Constitution.&nbsp; According to Garcia:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Under the U.S. legal system, international agreements can be entered into by means of a treaty or an executive agreement. The Constitution allocates primary responsibility for entering into such agreements to the executive branch, but Congress also plays an essential role. First, in order for a treaty (but not an executive agreement) to become binding upon the United States, the Senate must provide its advice and consent to treaty ratification by a two-thirds majority. Secondly, Congress may authorize congressional-executive agreements. Thirdly, many treaties and executive agreements are not self-executing, meaning that implementing legislation is required to provide U.S. bodies with the domestic legal authority necessary to enforce and comply with an international agreement’s provisions.<br><br><b><i>The status of an international agreement within the United States depends on a variety of factors. </i></b>Self-executing treaties have a status equal to federal statute, superior to U.S. state law, and inferior to the Constitution. <b><i>Depending upon the nature of executive agreements, they may or may not have a status equal to federal statute. In any case, self-executing executive agreements have a status that is superior to U.S. state law and inferior to the Constitution. Treaties or executive agreements that are not self-executing have been understood by the courts to have limited status domestically; rather, the legislation or regulations implementing these agreements are controlling</i></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)</blockquote><br>Domestic politics and constitutional guidelines also figure into the effect of an executive agreement in the United States. Garcia adds:<br><br><blockquote><b><i>The great majority of international agreements that the United States enters into are not treaties but executive agreements—agreements entered into by the executive branch that are not submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent</i></b>. Congress generally requires notification upon the entry of such an agreement. Although executive agreements are not specifically discussed in the Constitution, they nonetheless have been considered valid international compacts under Supreme Court jurisprudence and as a matter of historical practice.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>Sole executive agreements rely on neither treaty nor congressional authority to provide for their legal basis. The Constitution may confer limited authority upon the President to promulgate such agreements on the basis of his foreign affairs power. If the President enters into an executive agreement pursuant to and dealing with an area where he has clear, exclusive constitutional authority — such as an agreement to recognize a particular foreign government for diplomatic purposes — the agreement is legally permissible regardless of Congress’s opinion on the matter. If, however, the President enters into an agreement and his constitutional authority over the agreement’s subject matter is unclear, a reviewing court may consider Congress’s position in determining whether the agreement is legitimate. If Congress has given its implicit approval to the President entering the agreement, or is silent on the matter, it is more likely that the agreement will be deemed valid.

Yet, it is precisely these qualities that have allowed the <b>doctrine of international comity to mutate over time in ways that respond to different geopolitical circumstances.</b> Specifically, international comity has shifted in three distinct respects. First, the <b><i>meaning of comity has shifted over time.</i></b> Originally, international comity was a discretionary doctrine that empowered courts to decide when to defer to foreign law out of respect for foreign sovereigns. Comity has become a rule that obligates courts to apply foreign law in certain circumstances. Second, the <b><i>object of comity has changed</i></b>. Whereas once courts justified applying foreign law out of deference to foreign sovereigns, courts later justified their decisions out of deference to the autonomy of private parties or to the political branches. Most recently, courts have justified limits on domestic law out of deference to the global market. Third, <b><i>the function of comity has changed.</i></b> Comity is no longer merely a doctrine for deciding when to apply foreign law; it has become a justification for deference in a wide range of cases concerning prescriptive, adjudicatory, and enforcement jurisdiction.

Zamora</i> is whether the VFA amounted to an abdication of Philippine sovereignty insofar as the jurisdiction of local courts "to hear and try offenses committed by US military personnel"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup> was concerned.&nbsp; Upon finding at the outset that the VFA did not amount to grave abuse of discretion, this court no longer proceeded to rule on this matter:<br><br><blockquote>In fine, <b><i>absent any clear showing of grave abuse of discretion on the part of respondents, this Court — as the final arbiter of legal controversies and staunch sentinel of the rights of the people — is then without power to conduct an incursion and meddle with such affairs purely executive and legislative in character and nature.</i></b> For the Constitution no less, maps out the distinct boundaries and limits the metes and bounds within which each of the three political branches of government may exercise the powers exclusively and essentially conferred to it by law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>In sum, the extent of the VFA's categorization as between the Philippine and United States government — either as a "treaty"/"executive agreement" or as a matter subject to international comity — remains vague.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it is certain that the United States have made a political commitment to recognize the provisions and execute their obligations under the VFA.&nbsp; This includes respecting jurisdictional issues in cases involving an offense committed by a US military personnel.<br><br><b>Sovereign immunity as<br>customary international law</b><br><br>Customary international law traditionally pertains to:<br><br><blockquote>. . . the <b><i>collection of international behavioral regularities that nations over time come to view as binding on them as a matter of law</i></b>.

Because opinio juris refers to the reason why a nation acts in accordance with a behavioral regularity, it is often described as the “psychological” element of CIL. It is what distinguishes a national act done voluntarily or out of comity from one that a nation follows because required to do so by law.

Opinio juris in this context is reflected in particular in the assertion by States claiming immunity that international law accords them a right to such immunity from the jurisdiction of other States; in the acknowledgment, by States granting immunity, that inter- national law imposes upon them an obligation to do so; and, conversely, in the assertion by States in other cases of a right to exercise jurisdiction over foreign States</i></b>. While it may be true that States sometimes decide to accord an immunity more extensive than that required by international law, for present purposes, the point is that the grant of immunity in such a case is not accompanied by the requisite opinio juris and therefore sheds no light upon the issue currently under consideration by the Court.<br><br>56. Although there has been much debate regarding the origins of State immunity and the identification of the principles underlying that immunity in the past, <b><i>the International Law Commission concluded in 1980 that the rule of State immunity had been “adopted as a general rule of customary international law solidly rooted in the current practice of States”</i></b> (Yearbook of the International Law Commission, 1980, Vol. II (2), p. 147, para. 26). <b><i>That conclusion was based upon an extensive survey of State practice and, in the opinion of the Court, is confirmed by the record of national legislation, judicial decisions, assertions of a right to immunity and the comments of States on what became the United Nations Convention.</i></b> That practice shows that, whether in claiming immunity for themselves or according it to others, <b><i>States generally proceed on the basis that there is a right to immunity under international law, together with a corresponding obligation on the part of other States to respect and give effect to that immunity.</i></b><br><br>57. <b><i>The Court considers that the rule of State immunity occupies an important place in international law and international relations. It derives from the principle of sovereign equality of States, which, as Article 2, paragraph 1, of the Charter of the United Nations makes clear, is one of the fundamental principles of the international legal order.</i></b><br><br><b><i>This principle has to be viewed together with the principle that each State possesses sovereignty over its own territory and that there flows from that sovereignty the jurisdiction of the State over events and persons within that territory. Exceptions to the immunity of the State represent a departure from the principle of sovereign equality.</i></b> Immunity may represent a departure from the principle of territorial sovereignty and the jurisdiction which flows from it. (Emphasis supplied)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[154]</sup></blockquote><br>The International Court of Justice deemed it unnecessary to discuss the difference between the application of sovereign immunity in sovereign acts (<i>jus imperii</i>) and non-sovereign activities (<i>jus gestionis</i>) of a State.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[155]</sup>&nbsp; As to the argument that a serious violation of international law or peremptory norms (<i>jus cogens</i>) is an exception to sovereign immunity, the International Court of Justice held that:<br><br><blockquote>82. At the outset, however, the Court must observe that the proposition that the availability of immunity will be to some extent dependent upon the gravity of the unlawful act presents a logical problem. <b><i>Immunity from jurisdiction is an immunity not merely from being subjected to an adverse judgment but from being subjected to the trial process. It is, therefore, necessarily preliminary in nature. Consequently, a national court is required to determine whether or not a foreign State is entitled to immunity as a matter of international law before it can hear the merits of the case brought before it and before the facts have been established. If immunity were to be dependent upon the State actually having committed a serious violation of international human rights law or the law of armed conflict, then it would become necessary for the national court to hold an enquiry into the merits in order to determine whether it had jurisdiction. If, on the other hand, the mere allegation that the State had committed such wrongful acts were to be sufficient to deprive the State of its entitlement to immunity, immunity could, in effect be negated simply by skilful construction of the claim.</i></b><br><br>83. That said, the Court must nevertheless inquire whether customary international law has developed to the point where a State is not entitled to immunity in the case of serious violations of human rights law or the law of armed conflict. Apart from the decisions of the Italian courts which are the subject of the present proceedings, there is almost no State practice which might be considered to support the proposition that a State is deprived of its entitlement to immunity in such a case. . . .<br><br>84. In addition, there is a substantial body of State practice from other countries which demonstrates that <b><i>customary international law does not treat a State’s entitlement to immunity as dependent upon the gravity of the act of which it is accused or the peremptory nature of the rule which it is alleged to have violated.</i></b><br><br>85. <b><i>That practice is particularly evident in the judgments of national courts. Arguments to the effect that international law no longer required State immunity in cases of allegations of serious violations of international human rights law, war crimes or crimes against humanity have been rejected</i></b> by the courts in Canada (<i>Bouzari v. Islamic Republic of Iran, </i>Court of Appeal of Ontario, [2004] <i>Dominion Law Reports (DLR)</i>, 4<sup>th</sup> Series, Vol. 243, p. 406; ILR, Vol. 128, p. 586; allegations of torture), France (judgment of the Court of Appeal of Paris, 9 September 2002, and <i>Cour de cassation,</i> No. 02-45961, 16 December 2003, <i>Bulletin civil de la Cour de cassation (Bull. civ.),</i> 2003, I, No. 258, p. 206 (the Bucheron case); <i>Cour de cassation</i>, No. 03-41851, 2 June 2004, Bull. civ., 2004, I, No. 158, p. 132 (the X case) and <i>Cour de cassation</i>, No. 04-47504, 3 January 2006 (the <i>Grosz</i> case); allegations of crimes against humanity), Slovenia (case No. Up-13/99, Constitutional Court of Slovenia; allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity), New Zealand (<i>Fang v.

Saudi Arabia</i>, House of Lords, [2007] 1 Appeal Cases (AC) 270; ILR, Vol. 129, p. 629; allegations of torture).<br><br>. . . .<br><br>93. This argument therefore depends upon the existence of a conflict between a rule, or rules, of <i>jus cogens,</i> and the rule of customary law which requires one State to accord immunity to another. In the opinion of the Court, however, no such conflict exists. Assuming for this purpose that the rules of the law of armed conflict which prohibit the murder of civilians in occupied territory, the deportation of civilian inhabitants to slave labour and the deportation of prisoners of war to slave labour are rules of jus cogens, there is no conflict between those rules and the rules on State immunity. <b><i>The two sets of rules address different matters. The rules of State immunity are procedural in character and are confined to determining whether or not the courts of one State may exercise jurisdiction in respect of another State. They do not bear upon the question whether or not the conduct in respect of which the proceedings are brought was lawful or unlawful.</i></b> That is why the application of the con- temporary law of State immunity to proceedings concerning events which occurred in 1943-1945 does not infringe the principle that law should not be applied retrospectively to determine matters of legality and responsibility (as the Court has explained in paragraph 58 above). <b><i>For the same reason, recognizing the immunity of a foreign State in accordance with customary international law does not amount to recognizing as lawful a situation created by the breach of a jus cogens rule, or rendering aid and assistance in maintaining that situation, and so cannot contravene the principle in Article 41 of the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility.</i></b><br><br>95. <b><i>To the extent that it is argued that no rule which is not of the status of jus cogens may be applied if to do so would hinder the enforcement of a jus cogens rule, even in the absence of a direct conflict, the Court sees no basis for such a proposition</i></b>. A jus cogens rule is one from which no derogation is permitted but the rules which determine the scope and extent of jurisdiction and when that jurisdiction may be exercised do not derogate from those substantive rules which possess jus cogens status, nor is there anything inherent in the concept of jus cogens which would require their modification or would displace their application. The Court has taken that approach in two cases, notwithstanding that the effect was that a means by which a jus cogens rule might be enforced was rendered unavailable. <i><b>In Armed Activities, it held that the fact that a rule has the status of jus cogens does not confer upon the Court a jurisdiction which it would not otherwise possess</b> (Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (New Application: 2002) (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Rwanda), Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2006</i>, p. 32, para. 64, and p. 52, para. 125). In <i>Arrest Warrant</i>, the Court held, albeit without express reference to the concept of <i>jus cogens</i>, that the fact that a Minister for Foreign Affairs was accused of criminal violations of rules which undoubtedly possess the character of <i>jus cogens</i> did not deprive the Democratic Republic of the Congo of the entitlement which it possessed as a matter of customary international law to demand immunity on his behalf <i>(Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Belgium), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2002</i>, p. 24, para. 58, and p. 33, para. 78). The Court considers that the same reasoning is applicable to the application of the customary international law regarding the immunity of one State from proceedings in the courts of another.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[156]</sup></blockquote><br>Though pertaining to provisional measures, another case that involved the issue of sovereign immunity is the "Ara Libertad" case (<i>Argentina v.

Italy</i> that the issue of implied waiver of sovereign immunity and a State's commission of a serious violation of a peremptory norm (<i>jus cogens</i>) are two independent areas.&nbsp; This reflects one of the positions taken by scholars in the jurisdiction-immunity discourse:<br><br><blockquote>Jurisdiction and its limits have developed differently depending on the subject matter. The jurisdiction to adjudicate in civil matters has, for example, developed mainly in the context of private international law, even though it is not unrelated to public international law. <b><i>Immunity, on the other hand, is linked to official acts of a state (if we accept the principal distinction between private and public acts) and is therefore more sensitive to the sovereignty of the foreign state. </i></b>Linking immunity to the limits of jurisdiction to adjudicate in civil matters would therefore mean disregarding the official character of the foreign state's conduct.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[189]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)</blockquote><br>This ruling holds no value as a precedent, and, therefore, does not preclude the Philippines to make a determination that may be different from the International Court of Justice's ruling.&nbsp; Its value must only be to elucidate on the concept of sovereign immunity, in the context of that case, as the general rule with the possibility of other exceptions.<br><br>Furthermore, if we consider the doctrine of sovereign immunity as a binding general principle of international law rather than an international customary norm, the particular rules and guidelines in its application and invocation may be determined on a domestic level either through statute or by jurisprudence.<br><br>It is difficult to imagine that the recognition of equality among nations is still, in these modern times, as absolute as we have held it to be in the past or only has commercial acts as an exception.&nbsp; International law has conceded jus cogens rules of international law and other obligations erga omnes.&nbsp; It is time that our domestic jurisprudence adopts correspondingly.<br><br>Considering the flexibility in international law and the doctrines that we have evolved so far, <b><i>I am of the view that immunity does not necessarily apply to all the foreign respondents should the case have been brought in a timely manner, with the proper remedy, and in the proper court.&nbsp; Those who have directly and actually committed culpable acts or acts resulting from gross negligence resulting in the grounding of a foreign warship in violation of our laws defining a tortious act or one that protects the environment which implement binding international obligations cannot claim sovereign immunity.</i></b><br><br>Certainly, this petition being moot and not brought by the proper parties, I agree that it is not the proper case where we can lay down this doctrine.&nbsp; I, therefore, can only concur in the result.<br><br><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, I vote to DISMISS the petition.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> G.R.
