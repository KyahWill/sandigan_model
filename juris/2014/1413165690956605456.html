SP No. 91256, affirming the decision of the National Labor Relations Commission.&nbsp; The Commission affirmed the Labor Arbiter’s findings that there was no illegal dismissal in this case and that petitioner George A. Arriola abandoned his employment with respondent Pilipino Star Ngayon, Inc.<br><br>In July 1986, Pilipino Star Ngayon, Inc. employed George A. Arriola as correspondent assigned in Olongapo City and Zambales.&nbsp; Arriola had held various positions in Pilipino Star Ngayon, Inc. before becoming a section editor and writer of its newspaper.&nbsp; He wrote “Tinig ng Pamilyang OFWs” until his column was removed from publication on November 15, 1999.

Every business enterprise endeavors to increase its profits. In the process, it may adopt or devise means designed towards that goal. Even as the law is solicitous of the welfare of the employees, it must also protect the right of an employer to exercise what are clearly management prerogatives. . . . The free will of management to conduct its own business affairs to achieve its purposes cannot be denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Arriola abandoned his employment with Pilipino Star Ngayon, Inc.&nbsp; Abandonment is the “clear, deliberate and unjustified refusal of an employee to continue his employment, without any intention of returning.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup>&nbsp; It has two elements: first, the failure to report for work or absence without valid or justifiable reason and, second, a clear intention to sever employer-employee relations exists.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup>&nbsp; The second element is “the more determinative factor and is manifested by overt acts from which it may be deduced that the employee has no more intention to work.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup><br><br>Assuming that Arriola started writing for Imbestigador only on February 17, 2003, he nonetheless failed to report for work at Pilipino Star Ngayon, Inc. after November 15, 1999 and only filed his illegal dismissal complaint on November 15, 2002.&nbsp; He took three years and one day to remedy his dismissal.&nbsp; This shows his clear intention to sever his employment with Pilipino Star Ngayon, Inc.<br><br>Contrary to Arriola’s claim, <i>Villar v.

It could not likewise be given probative value as the said document does not bear the signature of an unauthorized representative of private respondent PSN[.] [N]either does it bears (sic) the official seal of the company. Besides, the abovementioned computation for separation pay is not a conclusive proof of the existence of dismissal or termination from work. It is just a mere computations (sic) which the authenticity thereof is being assailed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br>Considering the foregoing, we will not disturb the Labor Arbiter’s findings that Arriola was not illegally dismissed and that he abandoned his employment.&nbsp; This is true especially since the National Labor Relations Commission and the Court of Appeals affirmed these factual findings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals’ decision dated August 9, 2006 and resolution dated November 24, 2006 in CA-G.R.
