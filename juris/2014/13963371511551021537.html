The RTC ruled that it is the duty of petitioner to release the deposit to respondents as the act of withdrawal of a bank deposit is an act of demand by the creditor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>&nbsp; The RTC also said that the recourse of petitioner is against its negligent employees and not against respondents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup>&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered ordering [petitioner] METROPOLITAN BANK &amp;

Petitioner also contends that the fraud committed by respondent Rosales was clearly established by evidence;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> thus, it was justified in issuing the “Hold-Out” order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>Petitioner likewise denies that its employees were negligent in releasing the dollars.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup>&nbsp;

They insist that petitioner miserably failed to prove its accusations against respondent Rosales.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup>&nbsp; In fact, no documentary evidence was presented to show that respondent Rosales participated in the unauthorized withdrawal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup>&nbsp; They also question the fact that the list of the serial numbers of the dollar notes fraudulently withdrawn on February 6, 2003, was not signed or acknowledged by the alleged impostor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup>&nbsp; Respondents likewise maintain that what was established during the trial was the negligence of petitioner’s employees as they allowed the withdrawal of the funds without properly verifying the identity of the depositor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup>&nbsp; Furthermore, respondents contend that their deposits are in the nature of a loan; thus, petitioner had the obligation to return the deposits to them upon demand.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup>&nbsp; Failing to do so makes petitioner liable to pay respondents moral and exemplary damages, as well as attorney’s fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br><center><br><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>The Petition is bereft of merit.<br><br>At the outset, the relevant issues in this case are (1) whether petitioner breached its contract with respondents, and (2) if so, whether it is liable for damages.&nbsp; The issue of whether petitioner’s employees were negligent in allowing the withdrawal of Liu Chiu Fang’s dollar deposits has no bearing in the resolution of this case.&nbsp; Thus, we find no need to discuss the same.<br><br><b><i>The “Hold Out” clause does not apply<br>to the instant case.</i></b><br><br>Petitioner claims that it did not breach its contract with respondents because it has a valid reason for issuing the “Hold Out” order.&nbsp; Petitioner anchors its right to withhold respondents’ deposits on the Application and Agreement for Deposit Account, which reads:<br><br><blockquote>Authority to Withhold, Sell and/or Set Off:<br><br>The Bank is hereby authorized to withhold as security for any and all obligations with the Bank, all monies, properties or securities of the Depositor now in or which may hereafter come into the possession or under the control of the Bank, whether left with the Bank for safekeeping or otherwise,&nbsp; or coming into the hands of the Bank in any way, for so much thereof as will be sufficient to pay any or all obligations incurred by Depositor under the Account or by reason of any other transactions between the same parties now existing or hereafter contracted, to sell in any public or private sale any of such properties or securities of Depositor, and to apply the proceeds to the payment of any Depositor’s obligations heretofore mentioned.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>JOINT ACCOUNT<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The Bank may, at any time in its discretion and with or without notice to all of the Depositors, assert a lien on any balance of the Account and apply all or any part thereof against any indebtedness, matured or unmatured, that may then be owing to the Bank by any or all of the Depositors.&nbsp; It is understood that if said indebtedness is only owing from any of the Depositors, then this provision constitutes the consent by all of the depositors to have the Account answer for the said indebtedness to the extent of the equal share of the debtor in the amount credited to the Account.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup></blockquote><br>Petitioner’s reliance on the “Hold Out” clause in the Application and Agreement for Deposit Account is misplaced.<br><br>The “Hold Out” clause applies only if there is a valid and existing obligation arising from any of the sources of obligation enumerated in Article 1157<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup>of the Civil Code, to wit: law, contracts, quasi-contracts, delict, and quasi-delict.&nbsp; In this case, petitioner failed to show that respondents have an obligation to it under any law, contract, quasi-contract, delict, or quasi-delict.&nbsp; And although a criminal case was filed by petitioner against respondent Rosales, this is not enough reason for petitioner to issue a “Hold Out” order as the case is still pending and no final judgment of conviction has been rendered against respondent Rosales.&nbsp; In fact, it is significant to note that at the time petitioner issued the “Hold Out” order, the criminal complaint had not yet been filed.&nbsp; Thus, considering that respondent Rosales is not liable under any of the five sources of obligation, there was no legal basis for petitioner to issue the “Hold Out” order.&nbsp; Accordingly, we agree with the findings of the RTC and the CA that the “Hold Out” clause does not apply in the instant case.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, we find that petitioner is guilty of breach of contract when it unjustifiably refused to release respondents’ deposit despite demand.&nbsp; Having breached its contract with respondents, petitioner is liable for damages.<br><br><b><i>Respondents are entitled to moral and <br>exemplary damages and attorney’s fees.</i></b><br><br>In cases of breach of contract, moral damages may be recovered only if the defendant acted fraudulently or in bad faith,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> or is “guilty of gross negligence amounting to bad faith, or in wanton disregard of his contractual obligations.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>In this case, a review of the circumstances surrounding the issuance of the “Hold Out” order reveals that petitioner issued the “Hold Out” order in bad faith.&nbsp; First of all, the order was issued without any legal basis.&nbsp; Second, petitioner did not inform respondents of the reason for the “Hold Out.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup>&nbsp; Third, the order was issued prior to the filing of the criminal complaint.&nbsp; Records show that the “Hold Out” order was issued on July 31, 2003,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> while the criminal complaint was filed only on September 3, 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup>&nbsp; All these taken together lead us to conclude that petitioner acted in bad faith when it breached its contract with respondents.&nbsp; As we see it then, respondents are entitled to moral damages.<br><br>As to the award of exemplary damages, Article 2229<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> of the Civil Code provides that exemplary damages may be imposed “by way of example or correction for the public good, in addition to the moral, temperate, liquidated or compensatory damages.”&nbsp; They are awarded only if the guilty party acted in a wanton, fraudulent, reckless, oppressive or malevolent manner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>In this case, we find that petitioner indeed acted in a wanton, fraudulent, reckless, oppressive or malevolent manner when it refused to release the deposits of respondents without any legal basis.&nbsp; We need not belabor the fact that the banking industry is impressed with public interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup>&nbsp; As such, “the highest degree of diligence is expected, and high standards of integrity and performance are even required of it.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup>&nbsp; It must therefore “treat the accounts of its depositors with meticulous care and always to have in mind the fiduciary nature of its relationship with them.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup>&nbsp; For failing to do this, an award of exemplary damages is justified to set an example.<br><br>The award of attorney’s fees is likewise proper pursuant to paragraph 1, Article 2208<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> of the Civil Code.<br><br>In closing,&nbsp; it must be stressed that while we recognize that petitioner has the right to protect itself from fraud or suspicions of fraud, the exercise of this right should be done within the bounds of the law and in accordance with due process, and not in bad faith or in a wanton disregard of its contractual obligation to respondents.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is hereby <b>DENIED</b>.&nbsp;
