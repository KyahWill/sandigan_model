They maintained that the titles in the names of the spouses Manguardia are valid and legal.&nbsp; In addition, since the documents of sale and Torrens titles were duly registered in the Registry of Deeds, and that actual possession by the different transferees spanning a period of over 30 years were known to the respondents and their predecessors without any complaint or opposition, the claim of respondents is barred by prescription, estoppel and laches.&nbsp; The heirs of the spouses Manguardia moreover asserted that the Complaint against them fails to allege a cause of action and that the same was not brought by the real parties-in-interest.<br><br>On the other hand, the heirs of Leonardo and Rebecca<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> (except Antonio Araza) in their Answer,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> averred that their Torrens title covering Lot 835-D is valid and lawful having been issued as a result of their parents’ acquisition of said lot from the registered owners, spouses Pedro and Soledad.&nbsp; They averred that their parents were purchasers in good faith and for value and that the document of sale is genuine and authentic.&nbsp; The heirs of Leonardo and Rebecca further alleged that the matter of the subdivision and ownership of the lots was known to respondents as they had been, from Mindanao, coming back and forth to the subject property; and, that despite such knowledge, they never claimed or complained about the ownership of Leonardo and his heirs over the subject lot.&nbsp; By way of affirmative and special defenses, the heirs of Leonardo and Rebecca contended that the action is already barred by prescription, estoppel and laches.&nbsp; This is considering that immediately after the sale in 1972, their parents possessed and exercised all acts of dominion over Lot 835-D without opposition from anyone, including Graciano.&nbsp; Also, there is no cause of action against them and the Complaint was not brought by the real parties-in-interest.<br><br>In their Answer<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> to the Amended Complaint, the heirs of Enecita Araza Vargas raised the same averments, affirmative and special defenses, and counterclaims as those raised by the other heirs of Leonardo and Rebecca. Likewise, Antonio Araza adopted the Answer of the other heirs in a Manifestation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> submitted to the court.<br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Regional Trial Court</i></b><br><br>The&nbsp; trial&nbsp; resulted&nbsp; in&nbsp; the RTC rendering&nbsp; a&nbsp; Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>&nbsp; in&nbsp; favor&nbsp; of&nbsp; herein<br><br>respondents. It declared the Deed of Absolute Sale dated October 28, 1968 void <i>ab initio</i> because there was no proof that the vendors, Marta and Simplicio, were still alive in 1968 and had signed/thumb marked the sale document.&nbsp; The RTC likewise opined that the vendees in the questioned sale document could not feign ignorance of the death of the purported vendors because two of them are their brothers, while each of the other two are children of each of the said vendors.&nbsp; Consequently, the RTC also declared the series of documents of sale, including the Subdivision Agreements and the corresponding Torrens titles issued subsequent to OCT No. RO-4017, as null and void.&nbsp; It did not consider the subsequent buyers of the different portions of the lot as innocent purchasers in good faith and for value because some transfers were made by and among co-vendees, a witness in the void Deed of Absolute Sale, and close relatives. The transfers did not go far, but were limited to close relatives by affinity and consanguinity, living in close proximity to each other.&nbsp; Because of these, the trial court found it hard, if not impossible, to presume good faith among the parties to the series of conveyances.<br><br>With regard to the issue of laches and prescription, the trial court held that it would be impractical, unjust and patently iniquitous to apply laches against the respondents by virtue of an absolutely simulated deed which never conveyed any right over the subject properties to the alleged original buyers.&nbsp; It ratiocinated that laches is an equitable doctrine and its application is controlled by equitable considerations; it cannot be used to defeat justice or to perpetrate fraud and injustice.<br><br>The trial court did not also give credence to petitioners’ assertion that they acquired the subject properties thru prescription or adverse possession, ratiocinating that the right to recover possession of land registered under the Torrens system does not prescribe. Besides, assuming that extraordinary prescription of 30 years is applicable in the case at bar, the trial court opined that the said 30-year period from October 28, 1968 has not yet elapsed when demands to return the property were assumed to be made in September 1998, the time when the alleged sale transactions were discovered by the respondents. Petitioners mistakenly concluded that the respondents were estopped from challenging their possession and ownership based on a mere <i>presumption</i> of knowledge on the part of the latter.&nbsp; The accidental discovery of the documents of sale and corresponding titles in 1998 confirmed respondents’ lack of knowledge of the transactions.<br><br>The dispositive portion of the RTC Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the [respondents] and against [petitioners]:<br><br>1.&nbsp; Declaring the Deed of Absolute Sale, Exh. “B”, dated October 28, 1968 purportedly executed by Marta Valles and Simplicio Valles in favor of Rustico Valles, Melquiades Valles, Encarnacion Ordas and Adelaida Valles void <i>ab initio</i> and therefore non-existent;<br><br>2.&nbsp; Declaring the Subdivision Agreement dated October 29, 1968 Exh. “E” executed by and among Melquiades Valles, Rustico Valles, Adelaida Valles and Encarnacion Ordas, null and void and inexistent;<br><br>3.&nbsp; Deed of Absolute Sale of Realty, dated February 16, 1970, Exh. “J”, executed by Melquiades Valles in favor of Roberto Araza married to Dolores Domingo and Encarnacion Ordas married to Jose Romero, covering Lot 835-B, null and void;<br><br>4.&nbsp; Declaring the Deed of Absolute Sale dated February 15, 1972 Exh. “L” executed by [Encarnacion Ordas and] Roberto Araza [married to Dolores De Domingo in favor of Soledad Manalo-Araza] married to Pedro Araza, covering Lot 835-B, as null and void;<br><br>5.&nbsp; Declaring the Deed of Absolute Sale, Exh. “N”, executed by Pedro Araza and Soledad Manalo-Araza in favor of Joaquin Manguardia and Susana Manalo, dated November 27, 1980, covering Lots 835-B and 835-C, as null and void;<br><br>6.&nbsp; Declaring the Deed of Absolute Sale, Exh. “P”, dated January 27, 1969, executed by Encarnacion Ordas in favor of Rustico Valles, covering Lot 835-C, void <i>ab initio </i>and inexistent;<br><br>7.&nbsp; Declaring the Deed of Absolute Sale, Exh. “R”, dated March 19, 1970 executed by Rustico Valles and Petrona Bacarra in favor of Spouses Pedro Araza and Soledad Manalo-Araza covering Lots Nos. 835-C and 835-[D] as void <i>ab initio</i> and inexistent;<br><br>8.&nbsp; Declaring the Deed of Absolute Sale, Exh. “V”, dated May 8, 1972, executed by Spouses Pedro Araza and Soledad Manalo-Araza in favor of Leonardo Araza and Soledad Arroyo null and void;<br><br>9.&nbsp; Declaring TCT Nos. 9409 issued in the names of Melquiades Valles married to Flora Zabal; Rustico Valles married to Pedrona Bacarra; Adelaida Valles and Encarnacion Ordas married to Jose Romero null and void;<br><br>10.

Clearly, the forged deed containing the simulated signatures of Simplicio and Marta who were known to be both dead at the time of the execution of the said document is a nullity, and cannot serve as a just title.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></blockquote><br>The CA did not likewise give merit to the defense put forth by petitioners that respondents’ action is already barred by laches and prescription. Citing<i> St. Peter Memorial Park, Inc. v. Cleofas</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> and <i>J.M. Tuason &amp; Co., Inc. v. Aguirre,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> it held that a party who immediately filed a case upon discovery that his/her property was covered by a title in another’s name is not guilty of laches.&nbsp; Moreover, an action to recover possession of a registered land never prescribes. The CA further found that respondents immediately took steps to assert their rights to the subject properties upon discovery of the various titles by demanding from petitioners that possession of the same be returned to them, and by subsequently filing an action for the nullification of the certificates of titles in question and recovery of possession of the property covered by the original title, OCT No. RO-4017.<br><br>The <i>fallo</i> of the CA Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>[WHEREFORE], the appeal of [petitioners] is DENIED for lack of merit.&nbsp; Accordingly, the assailed Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Roxas City, Branch 15, dated 19 December 2002 is AFFIRMED IN TOTO.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> but the same was denied in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> dated March 27, 2007.<br><br><center><b>Issue</b><br></center><br>Hence, this Petition raising the sole issue of:<br><br><blockquote>[WHETHER] THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS TWENTIETH (20TH) DIVISION ERRED IN DENYING THE APPEAL OF [PETITIONERS] AND [IN] AFFIRMING THE ASSAILED DECISION OF THE COURT A QUO PETITIONERS HEREIN BEING BUYERS IN GOOD FAITH.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></blockquote><br><b><i>Arguments of the Petitioners</i></b><br><br>Petitioners argue that the CA failed to appreciate material facts which, if properly considered, would warrant the reversal of the Decision of the court a quo. They posit that the failure of the lower courts to appreciate relevant facts resulted in the erroneous finding that they are not buyers in good faith and for value and this rendered their Torrens titles of no value and effect.&nbsp; Petitioners insist that they acquired the subject lots in good faith, for value, and by prescription or adverse possession; that their titles are valid and legal considering that they stemmed from a series of registered sales and titles from as early as 1968 when Lot 835 was first sold and subdivided into four lots; that respondents are guilty of laches for neglecting to assert their alleged rights within a reasonable period of time despite the fact that the documents of sale, subdivision agreement and various land titles are duly registered, and despite respondents’ knowledge of petitioners’ actual possession of the properties spanning a period of 30 years; and, that after the sale, they immediately took possession of the lots and exercised acts of dominion over the same without any opposition from any of the respondents.<br><br>In further defending their claim of good faith, petitioners assert that they are not required to go beyond what appears on the face of the Torrens title of the previous owner; otherwise, it would defeat the primary objective of the Torrens System.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>&nbsp; Furthermore, their ownership which is rooted in good faith is independent of that of the previous owners’ title.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Arguments of the Respondents<b><i></i></b><br><br>Respondents, on the other hand, argue that only questions of law may be raised in an appeal by <i>certiorari </i>under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.&nbsp; They contend that the lone issue raised by the petitioners dealt with the determination of whether petitioners’ predecessors-in-interest were buyers in good faith, which is a factual issue generally outside the scope of the Supreme Court’s power in a petition for review on <i>certiorari.</i>&nbsp; In any case, petitioners failed to prove that their predecessors-in-interest were buyers in good faith.&nbsp; Hence, there exists no apparent reason for this Court to review the lower courts’ decisions.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>The Petition lacks merit.<br><br><i>The Court finds no reason to depart from<br>the factual findings of the lower courts.&nbsp; </i><br><br>Time and again, this Court has reiterated that it is not a trier of facts.&nbsp; Well entrenched is the principle that factual findings of the trial court, when adopted and confirmed by the CA, are final and conclusive and may not be reviewed on appeal by this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>&nbsp; The Court’s “role in a petition under Rule 45 is limited to reviewing or reversing errors of law allegedly committed by the appellate court.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>&nbsp; This rule, however, is not without well defined exceptions.&nbsp; “Findings of fact of the trial court and the CA may be set aside when such findings are not supported by the evidence or where the lower courts' conclusions are based on a misapprehension of facts.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Considering the contention of petitioners that misinterpretation of facts was committed, this Court embarked on the task of reviewing the facts of this case.<br><br>After a painstaking review of the records, however, the Court finds no reason to reverse and set aside the factual findings of the trial court, as affirmed by the CA, since these factual findings are supported by and are based on preponderant evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br><i>Petitioners failed to discharge the burden<br>of proving that their predecessors-in-interest<br>were buyers in good faith.</i><br><br>Petitioners do not dispute that the original Deed of Absolute Sale is a forgery because the alleged vendors were already long dead when the questioned deed was executed.&nbsp; While their ownership rights are ultimately based upon this forged deed, petitioners assert that the good faith of their predecessors-in-interest validates their title over the lots.<br><br>The Court, however, disagrees.&nbsp; It must be noted that the relationships by consanguinity or affinity, between and among the vendors and vendees in the series of sales of the subject properties, were established by testimonial evidence. Again, these were not contradicted by petitioners.&nbsp; And as aptly concluded by the trial court, it can reasonably be assumed from these relations that the spouses Manguardia and Leonardo were not buyers in good faith, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>Are the Manguardias and Leonardo Araza third persons x x x who are innocent purchasers for value?<br><br>The general rule x x x that a person dealing with registered land has a right to rely on the Torrens Certificate of Title without need of inquiring further cannot apply when the party has actual knowledge of facts and circumstances that would impel a reasonably cautious man to make such inquiry or when the purchaser has knowledge of a defect or lack of title in his vendor or of sufficient facts to induce a reasonably prudent man to [inquire] into the status of the title of the property in litigation (Voluntad vs. Dizon, 313 SCRA 209).&nbsp; If circumstances exist that [require] a prudent man to investigate and he does not, he is deemed to have acted in <i>mala fide</i>, and his mere refusal to believe that a defect exists or his willful closing of his eyes to the possibility of the existence of a defect in his vendor’s title will not make him an innocent purchaser for value (Voluntad vs. Dizon, <u>supra</u>).<br><br>Spouses Soledad Manalo and Pedro Araza purchased the properties in question from Roberto Araza, x x x [Visitacion] Valles Araza’s son.&nbsp; The father of Roberto Araza, Panfilo Araza, was Pedro Araza’s brother, making Pedro Araza the uncle of Roberto Araza.&nbsp; Encarnacion Ordas, one of the two [v]endors of the land in question to Pedro Araza and Soledad Manalo Araza, is Roberto Araza’s cousin as the mother of Encarnacion Ordas and Roberto’s mother, x x x [Visitacion] are sisters.&nbsp; Joaquin Manguardia, on the other hand, is the husband of Susana Manalo, niece of Soledad Manalo Araza, being the daughter of Jose Manalo, Soledad’s brother.<br><br>Leonardo Araza, on the other hand is x x x [Visitacion] Valles-Araza’s son, whose father, Panfilo Araza is brother of Pedro Araza, Soledad Araza’s husband.&nbsp; x x x [Visitacion] is a sister of Simplicio Valles and Marta Valles, both of whom were dead when the Deed of Sale, exh. “B” was purportedly executed in 1968, selling the property, Lot 835, to x x x [Visitacion’s] brothers, Rustico and Melquiades, and [Visitacion’s] nieces, namely: Encarnacion Ordas and Adelaida Valles.<br><br>The transfers of the properties in question did not go far, but [were] limited to close family relatives by affinity and consanguinity.&nbsp; Circuitous and convoluted [as they may be], and involving more than two families but belonging to a clan which, although living in different barangays, such barangays belong to the same city and [are] adjacent to each other. Good faith among the parties to the series of conveyances is therefore hard if not impossible to presume.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup></blockquote><br>Unfortunately for the petitioners, they did not provide any sufficient evidence that would convince the courts that the proximity of relationships between/among the vendors and vendees in the questioned sales was not used to perpetrate fraud.&nbsp; Thus there is nothing to dispel the notion that apparent anomalies attended the transactions among close relations.&nbsp; Glaringly emphasized were the established facts that the parties to the alleged original sale in 1968, and the witnesses thereto were close relatives (siblings, children and nephew of Marta and Simplicio).&nbsp; Similarly, the vendors and vendees in subsequent sale transactions were either the co-vendees themselves in the original sale, first cousins, and close relatives by consanguinity and affinity. In addition, these transactions between close relatives happened at a time when everybody knew everyone, in a place where vendees lived in close proximity to the vendors, and to the disputed properties.<br><br>This is not to say however, that a sale between close relatives is automatically anomalous.&nbsp; It is just that in this particular case, the circumstances strongly show that fraud was committed <i>by</i> relatives <i>against </i>relatives and the evidence adduced by petitioners was insufficient to remove the cloud of doubt pertaining to the good faith of their predecessors-in-interest in acquiring the properties in question.<br><br>It must be emphasized that “the burden of proving the status of a purchaser in good faith and for value lies upon him who asserts that standing.&nbsp; In discharging the burden, it is not enough to invoke the ordinary presumption of good faith that everyone is presumed to act in good faith. The good faith that is here essential is integral with the very status that must be proved. x x x Petitioners have failed to discharge that burden.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br><i>Acquisitive prescription is not applicable<br>in the case at bar.<br></i><br>Petitioners’ contention of acquisitive prescription cannot prevail over the rights of respondents.&nbsp; To begin with, the disputed property is a duly registered land under the Torrens system.&nbsp; “It is well-settled that no title to registered land in derogation of that of the registered owner shall be acquired by prescription or adverse possession.&nbsp; Neither can prescription be allowed against the hereditary successors of the registered owner, because they merely step into the shoes of the decedent and are merely the continuation of the personality of their predecessor[-]in[-]interest.&nbsp; Consequently, since a certificate of registration covers it, the disputed land cannot be acquired by prescription regardless of petitioner's good faith.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br><i>Laches cannot be used to perpetrate injustice.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</i><br><br>On the claim of laches, this Court reiterates that “[l]aches is based upon equity and the public policy of discouraging stale claims. Since laches is an equitable doctrine, its application is controlled by equitable considerations.&nbsp; It cannot be used to defeat justice or to [perpetrate] fraud and injustice.&nbsp; Thus, the assertion of laches to thwart the claim of respondents is foreclosed because the [d]eed upon which [petitioners base their] claim is[, first and foremost,] a forgery.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>All told, the Court finds the trial court’s disquisition, as affirmed by the CA, in order.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is <b>DENIED</b>.&nbsp; The June 22, 2006 Decision and March 27, 2007 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
