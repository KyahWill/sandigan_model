				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The plaintiff railroad company and some of the defendants in condemnation 
proceedings had in the Court of First Instance of Batangas, appealed from the 
decree entered therein, and the case is now before us on their respective bills 
of exceptions.
<p>The land included in the amended complaint is a narrow strip some 6 
kilometers in length, running between Batangas and Bauan, divided into 97 
distinct parcels, and 153,397.51 square meters in extent. Of this land 27,265 
square meters were bought by plaintiff out of court, leaving for expropriation 
126,713.31 square meters, or a little over 12 1/2 hectares.</p>
<p>Commissioners to appraise the land and assess damages, were appointed and 
rendered separate reports. The court below accepted the report of the 
commissioner who placed the lowest valuation on the land and rendered judgment 
in conformity therewith. In the report of this commissioner the lands in 
question are classified as first-class, second-class, and third-class. 
First-class lands, without improvements, are given a valuation of 70 centavos 
the square meter, or P7,000 the hectare; second-class lands are given a 
valuation of 50 centavos the square meter, or P5,000 the hectare; and 
third-class a valuation of SO centavos the square meter or P3,000 the 
hectare.</p>
<p>The judgment entered in the court below further provides for the payment of 
compensation to the land owners for <em>mejoras</em> (improvements) consisting 
of growing crops, plants, and trees, fixing the value of a square meter of 
planted rice at 5 centavos; a square meter of planted corn at 10 centavos; and 
so on through the list of vegetables, plants, and trees which defendants alleged 
were growing on the land when the plaintiff .railroad took possession. No 
attempt was made to fix the total value of these crops, but the plaintiff 
company is ordered to pay the various defendants the amount which may appear to 
be due them as a result of an estimate based upon memoranda prepared by the 
company's engineers as to the crops, plants and trees growing on the land at the 
time when possession was taken.</p>
<p>The judgment further provides, in a few instances, for consequential damages 
to lands not taken by the railroad company, in accord with the report of the 
commissioners.</p>
<p>The total amount allowed by the court as compensation for the taking of the 
12 1/2 hectares of land, not including improvements (crops, plants, and trees) 
is P68,088.68, that is to say, an average of P5,447.09 the hectare; and counsel 
for plaintiff asserts that the estimated amount which the railroad company would 
be required to pay, under the decree, for so-called <em>mejoras</em> 
(improvements), consisting of crops, plants, and trees, is not less than P24,000 
or an average of P1,620 the hectare. If this estimate be accepted as correct the 
effect of the judgment entered in the court below would be to require the 
plaintiffs to pay for the 12 1/2 hectares of land together with the crops, 
plants and trees growing thereon, at the rate of P7,067.09 the hectares.</p>
<p>The land was dedicated exclusively to agricultural purposes and planted for 
the most part in rice and zacate, with some corn and sugar cane and a few 
coconut trees. It has no special advantages of location which tend to enhance 
its market value, or give it any present or future value for other than 
agricultural purposes. There is nothing in the record which would justify us in 
believing that as agricultural land it is notably superior to other agricultural 
lands lying in the same province, or elsewhere throughout the Island of Luzon; 
and a substantial part of it is unwatered (<em>terreno secano</em>), and as 
such, not very valuable even for agricultural purposes. We are convinced, 
therefore, that the market value placed upon it and upon the so-called 
<em>mejoras</em>, consisting of growing crops, plants, bushes, and trees, by the 
commissioners and by the court below is exorbitant and unreasonable, and so 
exorbitant and unreasonable as to leave no room for doubt that the separate 
reports filed by the commissioners as to the amount of compensation to which the 
owners of the land are entitled should be and must be rejected.</p>
<p>Following the precedents established by this court, we have examined the 
evidence upon which the reports of the commissioners and the judgment entered in 
the court below are based, and we think there is enough evidence before us to 
justify us in entering final judgment disposing of all the contentions of the 
parties as to the values which should be set upon the lands actually taken by 
the railroad company. (City of Manila <em>vs</em>. Estrada and Estrada, 25 Phil. 
Rep., 208; Manila Railroad Co. <em>vs</em>. Velazquez, 32 Phil. Rep., 286; 
Manila Railroad Co. <em>vs</em>. Aguilar, 35 Phil. Rep., 118.)</p>
<p>The testimony of the defendant land owners themselves, and of the witnesses 
called by them, as to the value of the lands in question, is so manifestly 
partial, and so evidently intended grossly to exaggerate the market value of 
these lands, as to render it practically worthless. Many of these claimants and 
their witnesses solemnly swore that their lands, used solely for agricultural 
purposes, are worth P10,000 and more the hectare, although the record quite 
clearly indicates that agricultural lands, in the section of the province 
wherein the lands in question are located, have rarely, if ever, brought a price 
upon the open market as high as 8 centavos a meter, or P800 the hectare; and the 
extracts from the public records of the sale of agricultural lands in that 
province submitted by the plaintiff would seem to indicate that the average 
price at which such lands have changed hands in recent years is less, rather 
than more, than half that amount.</p>
<p>The defendants introduced no evidence of transactions in agricultural lands 
in the vicinity of the land in question, and relied, for the most part, upon the 
manifestly partial and interested expressions of opinions by themselves and 
their witnesses as to the market value of the land taken by the railroad. It is 
fair to presume that if there had been any transactions in lands in the vicinity 
in which the defendants lived which would tend to rebut the evidence of the 
plaintiff, or to sustain the contentions of the defendants, it would have been 
introduced.</p>
<p>There is some evidence in the record disclosing that the railroad company 
itself paid as high as 30 centavos a meter for certain lands purchased by it 
from some of the original defendants in these proceedings. The trial judge lays 
considerable stress upon this fact; and, in support of his conclusions drawn 
therefrom, says that this court has held that the true market value of lands may 
be taken as the amount agreed upon "between one who desires to sell and another 
who desires to purchase." (Manila Hallway Co. <em>vs</em>. Fabie, 17 Phil. Rep., 
206.) But it is not to be forgotten that there are various limitations 
controlling this general statement, among others, those set out in our opinion 
in the case of the City of Manila <em>vs</em>. Estrada and Estrada 
(<em>supra</em>), wherein we said that "the market value of property is the 
price which it will bring when it is offered for sale by one who desires, 
<em>but is not obliged</em> to sell it, and is bought by one <em>who is under no 
necessity of having it."</em> Manifestly offers to purchase made to some of the 
defendants in these proceedings, or purchases actually made from others by 
private treaty and out of court, furnish no sound criterion as to the true 
market value of the lands in question, such purchases and offers to purchase 
having been made by the railroad company while under a practical "necessity of 
having" the lands along its right of way; and, for the further reason, that the 
transactions in these cases were had by way of compromise of questions in the 
course of litigation.</p>
<p>J. D. Crowe, provincial treasurer of the Province of Batangas, was called by 
the railroad and testified, in substance, that the market value of the lands in 
question is about double their assessed value, that is to say: first-class 
watered lands, about P660 the hectare; second-class watered lands, about P400 
the hectare; and sugar-cane lands from P284 to ?352 the hectare.</p>
<p>Pedro Pastor, the clerk of the court, a large land owner in the Province of 
Batangas, was called by the railroad, and testifying as to the value of 
agricultural lands such as those taken by the railroad, said that first-class 
watered lands are worth from P1,000 to P1,500 the hectare; second-class watered 
lands from P800 to P1,000 the hectare; and sugar-cane lands from P300 to P400 
the hectare.</p>
<p>These witnesses would seem to have been wholly disinterested and their 
experience as men of affairs in the Province of Batangas, whose official duties 
could not fail to have given them some special knowledge as to land valuations 
in that province, lends great weight to their expressions of opinion as to land 
values in the province in which they live, and justifies us in the belief that 
their estimates of the true market value of the land in question are not far 
astray. It is true that they do not claim to have any special knowledge of the 
various parcels of land in course of condemnation in these proceedings, but a 
review of all the evidence of record leaves no room for doubt in our minds that 
the true market value of these lands is not much, if any, greater than the 
average market value of lands of the same class in the section of the Province 
of Batangas wherein they are located.</p>
<p>As observed by the court below, the assessed valuation of lands in course of 
condemnation cannot be taken as conclusive as to the market value of such lands 
and, as a rule, such assessed values are considerably below the true market 
valuation; but when, as in the case at bar, it appears that the assessed 
valuations are based, in large part, upon the sworn statements of the owners, 
evidence as to such assessed valuations is competent and admissible and may be 
taken into consideration for what it is worth, in determining whether the values 
claimed by the owners in condemnation proceedings are grossly excessive and 
exorbitant and wholly beyond the bounds of reason; and in some cases as an 
element, though by no means a controlling one, in determining the real market 
value of the land taken. (Tenorio <em>vs</em>. Manila Railroad Co., 22 Phil. 
Rep., 411; City of Manila <em>vs</em>. Estrada and Estrada, 25 Phil. Rep., 208; 
Manila Railroad Co. <em>vs</em>. Velasquez, 32 Phil. Rep., 286.)</p>
<p>Having in mind the assessed valuation of the lands sought to be appropriated, 
the prices at which similar lands in the vicinity have changed hands in recent 
years, the estimate of the value of these lands set forth in the testimony of 
the witnesses Crowe and Pastor and in the testimony of the claimants and their 
witnesses, we are of opinion that the compensation allowed by the court below, 
in conformity with the report of the commissioners, is grossly excessive and 
exorbitant and must be set aside; and giving all the evidence in the record the 
consideration to which it is entitled, and making a liberal estimate of the 
values in view of the fact that the wishes and desires of the owners of the land 
in question have not been, and cannot be consulted in determining the amount and 
location of the lands taken and whether or not they should part with them, we 
are of opinion that just compensation for the lands described and classified in 
the opinion of the trial judge, including the so-called mejoras (improvements) 
thereon, consisting of growing crops, plants, bushes, trees and the like, other 
than fruit bearing coconut trees, should be fixed as follows:</p>
<p>For <em>terrenos regadios con agua propia</em> (first-class lands watered by 
springs), 12 centavos the square meter, or P1,200 the hectare; for <em>terrenos 
regadios sin agua propia</em> (second-class watered lands, not furnished with 
water from springs located on the land), 9 centavos the square meter, or P900 
the hectare; and for all other lands, including the lands referred to in the 
decision as <em>terrenos secanos</em> (unwatered lands), 6 centavos the square 
meter, or P600 the hectare.</p>
<p>While there is not sufficient credible evidence in the record upon which to 
base a finding as to the amounts which should be allowed the various claimants 
by way of compensation for alleged consequential damages, a review of the whole 
record satisfies us that the findings of the commissioners and of the court 
below as to the amount of these damages are exorbitant and unreasonable, and so 
much so that the decree must be set aside in so far as it provides for 
compensation therefor. Aside from any question as to the impartiality of the 
commissioners in determining the facts as to the nature and extent of these 
damages, it is manifest that their estimate of the amount of compensation which 
should be allowed therefor is based on a like exorbitant and extravagant 
valuation placed upon the lands which are alleged to have been damaged, as 
appears to have been placed on the lands actually taken.</p>
<p>No question is raised in this court as to the extent and location of the 
lands actually taken, nor as to the classification of these lands set forth in 
the decree as <em>terrenos regadios con agua propia</em> (first-class watered 
lands), <em>terrenos regadios sin agua propia</em> (second-class, watered 
lands), and <em>terrenos secanos</em> (third-class unwatered lands), nor as to 
the right of the railroad company to a decree for the condemnation of these 
lands.</p>
<p>We conclude, therefore, that the disposing part of the decree entered in the 
court below should be affirmed except in so far as it fixes the amounts to be 
allowed the owners of the lands taken, by way of compensation for their lands 
and the so-called <em>mejoras</em> (improvements) thereon, consisting of growing 
crops, plants, bushes and trees, and except in so far as it determines the 
nature and extent of the alleged consequential damages and the amounts which 
should be allowed by way of compensation therefor; that the excepted portions of 
the decree should be reversed; and that the record should be returned to the 
court below where an appropriate decree will be entered fixing the amount of 
compensation to be allowed the owners of the lands taken as heretofore 
indicated, that is to say, for both the lands and the so-called <em>mejoras</em> 
thereon, other than fruit bearing coconut trees, at the rate of 12 centavos the 
square meter for all lands which were found to be <em>terrenos regadios con agua 
propia</em> in the decree of the court below; at the rate of 9 centavos the 
square meter for all lands which were found in the decree of the court below to 
be <em>terrenos regadios sin agua propia</em>; and at the rate of 6 centavos the 
square meter for all other lands taken, including the lands found to be terrenos 
secanos in the decree of the court below; and such further proceedings will be 
taken as may be necessary to ascertain the compensation which should be allowed 
the various claimants for fruit bearing coconut trees on any of the lands 
actually taken and for alleged consequential damages, including the appointment 
of new commissioners duly authorized to report thereon, after which the 
appropriate decree will be entered in the court below fixing the amount of the 
compensation to which the various claimants may be found to be entitled. So 
ordered.</p>

<p align="center">DECISION ON MOTION FOR RULING.<br>[<em>July 25, 1917</em>]</p>
<p>CARSON, J.:</p>
<p>Counsel representing all the parties to the above entitled proceedings appear 
somewhat informally and ask for a ruling as to the rights of the land owners to 
interest uponthe amount of compensation fixed by the judgment in the 
above-entitled cause heretofore entered by this court, stating that a difference 
of opinion having arisen in this regard, the parties had agreed to submit the 
question to the court and accept its ruling thereon.</p>
<p>Assuming, without deciding, that the question is properly before us, we 
proceed to dispose of it in accord with the prayer of the parties, treating it 
as substantially equivalent to a request for instructions to the sheriff where a 
dispute arises as to the amount under a judgment for which execution should be 
levied.</p>
<p>The question submitted by the parties at this time is whether our judgment 
carried with it interest upon the amount fixed by way of compensation for the 
lands taken. It is suggested that in condemnation proceedings such as these now 
under consideration, the land owner is entitled to interest upon the amount 
actually allowed by the final judgment of the court, or at least upon the excess 
of that amount over the amount deposited at the time when the proceedings were 
instituted, from the time when possession was taken, until paid. But without 
stopping to consider what action the court would have taken had its attention 
been called to the omission in the judgment of any express provision for the 
payment of interest, before the judgment became final, it is sufficient at this 
time to say that an examination of the terms of the decision filed by this court 
on appeal discloses that it does not definitely determine the basis upon which 
the interest prior to the date of the judgment should or can be calculated, and, 
in fact, makes no provision for the payment of such interest. It follows, as of 
course, that the recovery of interest upon the amount of the judgment or of any 
part thereof, prior to the date of the judgment, cannot be enforced by 
execution, nor can interest be recovered by the land owners under the terms of 
the judgment.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Araullo, Street</em>, and <em>Malcolm, JJ.,</em> 
concur.<br><em>Johnson, J</em>., did not take part.<br></p></div>
