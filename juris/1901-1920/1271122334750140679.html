"The preceding&nbsp; copy agrees with its original which, for such&nbsp; purposes as are required, is kept in the office of the clerk of the court,&nbsp; which is under my charge.<br><br>"Sorsogon, April 29,&nbsp; 1910.<br><br><div style="text-align: right;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "LEON GALAROSA,<br>&nbsp; <i>"Deputy Clerk of the Court"</i></div></blockquote>Counsel for appellant, appointed de oficio by this court, makes no attempt&nbsp; to show a real miscarriage of justice in this&nbsp; case.&nbsp; Indeed the facts disclosed by the record would not justify any attempt to do so.&nbsp; Counsel,&nbsp; therefore, substantially&nbsp; limits himself to&nbsp; directing the attention of the court to the fact that, while the judgment&nbsp; pronounced by the court&nbsp; below bears date of the 3d. day of March, 1910, and sets out as a&nbsp; fact that the accused pleaded guilty on his arraignment, it appears from the minutes&nbsp; of&nbsp; the proceedings in the court, as kept by the clerk, that the arraignment did not take place until the 13th day of March, 1910, and that when the defendant entered his plea, he merely said&nbsp; that he deemed hfmself to be guilty (<i>que se considero culpable</i>).<br><br>The foregoing extracts from the record clearly set forth the grounds on which counsel's criticisms are based.<br><br>As to the discrepancy in the record touching the dates, we&nbsp; think that conceding every reasonable presumption in favor of the appellant, and granting that in dating his judgment as of the 3d day of March,&nbsp; 1910, the trial judge fell into a&nbsp; clerical error and&nbsp; that the judgment&nbsp; should&nbsp; have been dated as of the 13th of March, 1910, in order to conform to&nbsp; the&nbsp; real facts,&nbsp; nevertheless such error was at most error without prejudice.&nbsp; If as&nbsp; a result of the alleged erroneous dating&nbsp; of the judgment, or of its entry, the defendant were&nbsp; in&nbsp; danger&nbsp; of losing his right to appeal or any other substantial right, it might, indeed, be important to have the correctness of the date of the judgment inquired into and&nbsp; any&nbsp; clerical error therein corrected.&nbsp; But in this case there can be no danger that any substantial right of the&nbsp; appellant has&nbsp; been or can be prejudiced, granting that the&nbsp; judgment was incorrectly&nbsp; dated.<br><br>As a matter of fact, however, we&nbsp; do not&nbsp; think that the correctness of the date which appears on the face of the judgment is successfully impeached by a mere reference to the conflicting date which appears in the copy of the minutes kept by the clerk.&nbsp; It has in its favor all the presumptions of truth and accuracy in favor of&nbsp; a solemn judgment,&nbsp; rendered by the judge presiding&nbsp; in the court below.&nbsp; Its correctness was not questioned by the defendant at the time when it was entered, or pending the&nbsp; perfection of the appeal to this court.&nbsp; Its accuracy is in some sort corroborated by&nbsp; the&nbsp; recitals contained&nbsp; in&nbsp; the bail&nbsp; bond filed by&nbsp; the appellant himself,&nbsp; at the time when he perfected his appeal. And no attempt is made, by affidavits&nbsp; or otherwise, to show that the date&nbsp; which appears on the face of the judgment was not the true date on which it was rendered.<br><br>Similar reasoning disposes of counsel's attempt, by reference&nbsp; to this discrepancy in&nbsp; dates, to impeach the truth and&nbsp; accuracy of the solemn recital in the judgment that the defendant, prior&nbsp; to&nbsp; the time&nbsp; when it was rendered,&nbsp; was duly arraigned and&nbsp; pleaded to the&nbsp; information.&nbsp; In the absence of&nbsp; all proof to the contrary,&nbsp; we&nbsp; must conclude, either that the trial was had and the judgment entered on the 13th day of March, 1910, in which case the date which appears on&nbsp; the judgment is a&nbsp; clerical error of the judge, but an error without prejudice,&nbsp; as we have already said; or that the&nbsp; trial was had, the&nbsp; plea entered, and the judgment rendered on&nbsp; the&nbsp; 3d day of March,&nbsp; 1910, in which case the date which appears in the extract from the minutes is a clerical&nbsp; error of the clerk of the court, which, of course, in no wise prejudices the appellant, and is no cause for reversal.&nbsp; The trial judge&nbsp; having&nbsp; solemnly declared&nbsp; in his judgment that the accused was duly arraigned, pleaded to the charge, and thereupon his judgment was rendered; and the clerk's&nbsp; minutes clearly setting&nbsp; out that the accused was duly arraigned, pleaded to the charge,&nbsp; and that thereupon judgment was entered, it is absurd to contend that we would be justified in holding&nbsp; both these solemn recitals of fact to be false, merely because of a discrepancy in the dates of the record of the proceedings wherein they&nbsp; are set out, a discrepancy which may be readily accounted for by the accidental insertion of a 3 instead of a 13, or a 13 instead&nbsp; of a 3, in one or the other&nbsp; of&nbsp; the instruments&nbsp; in which the account of the proceedings is set forth.<br><br>As to&nbsp; counsel's&nbsp; attempt&nbsp; to impeach&nbsp; the correctness of the statement in the opinion of the trial judge wherein he sets forth that the accused declared himself guilty&nbsp; of the crime of which he was charged, by a reference to the statement in the minutes of the clerk which&nbsp; makes it appear that on arraignment, the accused said&nbsp; that he considered himself guilty, we think it is sufficient to say that we find no&nbsp; substantial&nbsp; difference between the&nbsp; statements of fact which both&nbsp; clearly&nbsp; set forth, to&nbsp; wit,&nbsp; that on arraignment the accused&nbsp; pleaded "guilty."&nbsp; The essence of the plea of "guilty" in a criminal trial, is that the accused, on arraignment, admits his guilt,&nbsp; freely, voluntarily, and with a full knowledge of the consequences and the meaning of his act. We do not think that the form&nbsp; of this admission is of vital importance,&nbsp; provided the admission of guilt is&nbsp; clear, definite, and unconditioned.&nbsp; Upon the solemn arraignment of the&nbsp; accused in the course of criminal proceedings against him, when he is&nbsp; asked whether he is guilty or not guilty of the offense charged in&nbsp; the complaint or information, the answers&nbsp; "Guilty;"&nbsp; "I am&nbsp; guilty;"&nbsp; "I&nbsp; consider myself guilty;" and "I declare myself guilty;" are all, under the circumstances, substantially similar and of like effect.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the fact that the accused upon arraignment admits his guilt of the offense charged in the complaint or information which is important, not the form&nbsp; of the language&nbsp; in which he does it.<br><br>We may observe, however, in this connection, that in our opinion, the form used by the trial judge in setting out the fact that a plea of "Guilty" was entered, is distinctly preferable to the form used by the clerk in his minutes; and it would seem that&nbsp; under the practice and usage introduced into these&nbsp; Islands by the publication of General Orders, No. 58, the better form in which the plea should be cast is the literal equivalent&nbsp; in the language&nbsp; or dialect of the&nbsp; accused of the words "I am guilty" or "I&nbsp; declare myself guilty." The judgment of conviction and the sentence imposed upon the appellant in the court below should be affirmed,&nbsp; with the costs of this instance against him.<br><br><i>Arellano, C.&nbsp; J., Mapa, Moreland, </i>and <i>Trent, JJ.,</i>&nbsp; concur.<br></div>
