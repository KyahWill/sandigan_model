				<BR><STRONG>MORELAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of the city 
of Manila dismissing upon the merits after trial plaintiff's action to recover 
damages alleged to have been sustained through defendant's breach of a 
stipulation to renew for a second year a written contract for the exclusive 
five-passenger automobile privilege of the defendant hotel.
<p>It seems that, on the 9th of November 1912, plaintiff and defendant entered 
into a written contract by which the defendant ceded to the plaintiff the 
exclusive right to serve its patrons with five-passenger automobiles for a 
period of one year from the date thereof, with certain rights with respect to a 
renewal of the contract for a second year.</p>
<p>Plaintiff entered on the performance of his duties under the contract and 
successfully discharged them during the first year. When about half of the first 
year had expired, and about June, 1913, the defendant company, disregarding, as 
plaintiff claims, the terms of its agreement with him, invited proposals from 
various garages for its five-passenger automobile privilege for the ensuing 
year, that is, from November, 1913, to November, 1914, the time covered by the 
second year of plaintiff's contract. Under these proposals various garages 
competed for the privilege, including that of George E. Brown, and, after 
certain negotiations with the latter, his offer was accepted by the defendant 
company and a written contract made with him for the exclusive right to the 
five-passenger automobile privilege during the year beginning November 9,1913. 
This contract with Brown was executed some months prior to the termination of 
the first year of plaintiff's contract.</p>
<p>Upon the termination of the first year of the contract the defendant company 
having, as we have seen, already entered into a contract with Brown relative to 
the matter included in plaintiff's contract for the period representing the 
second year thereof, refused, over plaintiff's objections and protests, to 
permit him to continue for the second year, deprived him of the privilege which 
the contract conferred, and evicted him from the hotel where, under the terms of 
the contract, he was entitled to have and did have an office.<br><br>This action 
was brought to recover damages for breach of contract.</p>
<p>The contract between the parties hereto contains a clause which forms the 
subject matter of this litigation. It is as follows: "This agreement to remain 
in effect for a period of one year from date, with preference over others of 
renewing for a further period of one year."</p>
<p>There are two questions involved.</p>
<p>The first one is whether that portion of the agreement just quoted gave the 
plaintiff an enforceable right to renew the contract for a second year.</p>
<p>The second is whether the plaintiff, even though he had that right, did, by 
his acts and conduct, waive that right and thereby exempt the defendant from the 
liability, if any, which it incurred by its eviction of plaintiff and the 
refusal" to permit him to enjoy the privilege for the second year.</p>
<p>As to the first question:</p>
<p>Counsel for the defendant company contend that the clause quoted gave the 
appellant no right to renew the contract sued upon for the second year. They 
assert that it did nothing more than give to plaintiff the right to compete with 
others in obtaining defendant's five-passenger automobile privilege for said 
second year, with preference to him to be engaged over his competitors in case 
his offer was equally profitable to the defendant hotel. They further contend 
that the competition into which he was thus thrust did not relate exclusively to 
the contract in which the clause is found or to the terms and conditions of that 
contract ; but that it referred to any contract which the defendant hotel 
offered to make or could make with any person, whatever its terms and conditions 
might be.</p>
<p>On the other hand, plaintiff claims that the contract gave him a right to 
renew and that the stipulation for a renewal did not contemplate other or 
different terms than those embraced in the contract to be renewed and that by 
entering into the Brown contract and evicting the plaintiff from the premises 
the defendant violated its' obligation to grant the plaintiff a renewal of his 
contract for a second year.</p>
<p>We are constrained to agree with plaintiff's contention.</p>
<p>It must be remembered that the contract relating to the five-passenger 
automobile privilege was a complete con tract, whereby the plaintiff was. 
required to furnish a certain number of five-passenger automobiles and to attend 
faithfully and fully to the requirements of the patrons of the hotel, for which 
he was to receive a stipulated compensation. The construction placed upon the 
clause by defendant deprives the plaintiff of any right or interest in that 
particular contract or any renewal thereof and relegates him to a scramble to 
obtain <em>not the same contract for a second year but an entirely different 
contract for one or more</em> years. By this contention the clause in question 
is torn from the agreement in which it was placed by the parties and made to do 
service not with relation to the contract in which it is found but with relation 
to another contract different in every conceivable term.</p>
<p>It would seem, other things being equal, that a clause in a contract should 
be construed with reference to the contract in which it is found, and if it 
accords a privilege to one party or the other, it should be in connection with 
the contract to which it refers. The contract in which the clause is found was, 
generally speaking, one whereby the plaintiff was to furnish a certain number of 
five-passenger automobiles, attend faithfully to the needs of the patrons of the 
hotel, to continue his service for a period of one year and to receive as 
compensation all the proceeds of the business less, say, 10 per cent to be paid 
to the defendant for the privilege. This, with other details, is the contract in 
which the clause is found and to which it refers. That clause was, in our 
judgment, not intended to do duty with reference to a contract, such as the 
hotel company made with Brown, already referred to, by which the latter was to 
have the five-passenger automobile privilege of the hotel, as well as all other 
automobile and carriage privileges, upon the payment to the hotel of a flat sum 
of, say, P10,000 annually. According to the defendant, the clause in question 
simply concedes to plaintiff the privilege over Brown, if he desired it, of 
taking and accepting the contract which the hotel made with Brown. In other 
words, defendant here contends, and the court below found, that the clause in 
question did not confer a certain, enforceable right upon the plaintiff with 
reference to the contract in which the clause was found, but simply gave him the 
preference over others to make with the defendant company any contract which the 
latter might be able to make with any other person. As stated in the brief of 
counsel in the trial court the stipulation for a renewal conferred upon the 
plaintiff only the right to make "as satisfactory an offer as any other person," 
and that since plaintiff failed to make as favorable an offer as did Mr. Brown, 
that is, since plaintiff would-do no more than propose a renewal of the old 
contract, the hotel company had a right to contract with Brown,</p>
<p>Manifestly the clause "with preference over others of renewing for a further 
period of one year" was inserted for a purpose. It was intended to confer a 
right either on the plaintiff or upon the defendant. That it was not intended to 
confer a right on the defendant is conceded. It must have been intended, 
therefore, to do something favorable to the plaintiff. What was it?</p>
<p>While it is conceded that the clause quoted confers no right on the defendant 
company, the latter, nevertheless, contends that it conferred no right on the 
plaintiff. Even though the clause, as claimed by defendant, gave the plaintiff a 
preference over others with respect to some other contract, a contract which 
might be entirely distasteful to the plaintiff in, every term and which, with 
his limited resources, he would be unable to accept at all, such preference 
would not be a substantial right. In fact, it would be a right the effect of 
which would be not only problematical but as likely to be injurious as 
beneficial. If the clause conferred no right upon either the plaintiff or the 
defendant, then it has no meaning to which the law attaches importance. That 
this was intended we cannot believe. We are confident that it was placed in the 
contract for the purpose of conferring upon the plaintiff an enforceable right 
and one which related to the very contract in which it was placed. This clause 
sets out with sufficient clearness an agreement for a renewal of the contract 
for a second year. It cannot have any other significance in language. The 
grammatical construction of the stipulation precludes the legal construction 
given it by the court below. The clause "with preference over others of renewing 
for a further period of one year" does not modify anything preceding it. It must 
be construed as a separate and independent sentence whose subject is suppressed. 
Should we supply the words omitted by the draftsman, apparently with a view to 
brevity, the stipulation would be plain; it would clearly appear that it was 
intended to be a stipulation in favor of the plaintiff.</p>
<p>Nor is the contention made by the defendant relative to the phrase "with 
preference over others" sufficient to destroy that construction. It is asserted 
that this phrase deprived the plaintiff of the right of renewing the existing 
contract and relegated him to the barren right of accepting at the end of the 
first year the best terms that defendant might be able to secure from other 
persons for the exclusive concession to which the contract refers, thereby 
transforming the stipulation for renewal in favor of the plaintiff to one in 
favor of the defendant. As already pointed out, the grammatical structure of the 
stipulation shows both that the thing to be renewed was the agreement in force 
the first year and that the party who possessed the right to renew was the 
plaintiff.<br><br>The construction of the phrase "with preference over others" 
contended for by the defendant and found by the court below not only overthrows 
the grammatical structure of the stipulation but nullifies the meaning of the 
essential term in the stipulation, namely, the word "renew." The meaning of that 
word, wherever applied with respect to real or personal rights, is not a matter 
of discussion and, unless the stipulation to renew expressly provides for 
variations in the terms of the contract to be renewed, the clause of renewal 
aways relates to the contract in which it is found. To attribute to the words 
"with preference over others" a meaning that nullifies an essential word of 
common usage and conventional signification is to vary an elementary rule of 
construction. While the use of the phrase "over others" after the noun 
"preference," which means the act of preference or the state of being preferred 
or chosen before others, is not altogether elegant English and is somewhat 
ambiguous with respect to its reference, the clause succeeding it, namely, "of 
renewing for a further period of one year," relieves that phrase of so much of 
its ambiguity as to make its presence clearly unnecessary for a perfect 
understanding of the agreement. When one party to a contract gives the other an 
enforceable right, then certainly the one to whom the right is conceded has 
preference over all others with respect to that right, including the other party 
to the contract; and if the party conceding the right adds to the contract a 
phrase "with preference over others" with respect to that right, it adds nothing 
to the contract and those words may be stricken out without altering its natural 
or legal sense. Thus, in the contract before us, if the defendant company, by 
the clause in question, conceded to the plaintiff an enforceable right, then the 
plaintiff received preference over all others with respect to that right and the 
adding of the Words "with preference over others" did not serve to deprive the 
plaintiff of the right thus conceded, and those words should not be so construed 
as to effect that end. They were useless and redundant and could have had no 
force or effect without destroying the very purpose for which the clause itself 
was inserted. If this construction were not followed, we would be obliged, as 
already intimated, to declare that the phrase "of renewing for a further period 
of one year" would have no adequate significance. The construction contended for 
by the defendant wipes these words from the contract and leaves it in that 
respect the same as if they had not been inserted. No such construction can be 
permitted, as it takes from the contract words of the most material 
signification. If, in the construction of a contract, one of two clauses must be 
eliminated, it must be that one the influence of which upon the essentials of 
the contract is the least. As we have shown, the words "with preference over 
others" are of no substantial significance. On the other hand, the phrase 
providing for a renewal is of very great materiality and importance and carries 
into the contract an idea which would not have been there if it had not been 
used.</p>
<p>As to the second question:</p>
<p>What appears to be, perhaps, the main contention of the defendant in this 
case is that plaintiff never made a request for the renewal of the contract for 
the second year but, instead of so doing, sought to make other and different 
arrangements with the hotel and with Brown, to whom, as we have seen, the hotel 
conceded the privilege which is the subject of this action, thereby indicating 
an intention to abandon his right, if any he had, to a renewal of the contract 
for the second year. It is asserted by counsel for the defendant that in July 
plaintiff attempted to enter into a partnership agreement with the hotel 
relative to the privilege in question for the period covering the second year of 
plaintiff's contract, and that, failing in that, and believing that Brown would 
secure the privilege from the hotel, he thereupon sought to make a contract with 
Brown by which he could assist him in fulfilling his contract with the hotel. It 
is even contended by defendant that plaintiff actually did enter into an 
agreement with Brown relative to that matter.</p>
<p>A careful reading of the testimony in this case leads us to differ with 
counsel for the appellee as to the real facts of the case and constrains us to 
differ materially from the conclusions drawn by counsel for the defendant from 
the acts of the plaintiff as set out in the record. </p>
<p>As to the facts, we may say that the evidence does not sustain the contention 
that plaintiff entered into a contract with Brown. The proof discloses that the 
plaintiff sought to make arrangements with the hotel of a nature different from 
those contained in the contract under consideration and also that he had 
negotiations with Brown looking to an agreement with him whereby he might assist 
him in handling the five-passenger automobile business under the privilege which 
it appeared the hotel would concede to him. No contract, however, wag made with 
either and the plaintiff at no time found himself under any obligation to the 
defendant or Brown by reason of the acts which appellee makes the basis of its 
argument.</p>
<p>To us the important fact is that before the plaintiff entered into 
negotiations or made any offers with respect to the five-passenger automobile 
privilege either with or to the defendant or Brown, the hotel had impliedly 
denied the plaintiff's rights with respect to the contract before us, had 
refused to recognize the clause for a renewal of the contract for a second year 
as binding upon it, and, as a result, as early as June, 1913, had, according to 
its brief in this court "invited proposals from various garages for its 
automobile service for the ensuing year." In other words, the defendant had, 
prior to the negotiations and offers of plaintiff, repudiated its contract with 
him so far as it related to the renewal for the second year and was preparing 
itself to make a contract with any person with whom it might secure the most 
advantageous terms.</p>
<p>Not only did the defendant advertise for bids or offers concerning its 
automobile privilege for the period embraced in the second year of the contract 
under consideration, but sometime before the first year of that contract had 
expired the defendant had actually made a contract with Brown by which it had 
conceded to him said privilege for the period embraced in the second year of the 
plaintiff's contract. Thus, when the first year of plaintiff's contract 
terminated, he found that the defendant had rejected its obligation under the 
renewal clause, had let the contract to another person, and when he sought, as 
he did seek, to continue in the performance of his contract for the second year, 
defendant evicted him from the premises and denied him the right which he sought 
to exercise.</p>
<p>We are of the opinion that, when a person who is under an obligation to 
another to perform certain acts upon the demand of that person, repudiates that 
obligation prior to the time when the demand for its fulfillment is necessary, 
the person to whom that obligation runs is not required to sit down, fold his 
hands and calmly await the disaster which the violation of the obligation 
entails. We believe that, under such circumstances, he is entirely within his 
rights and, therefore, waives nothing, when he seeks other employment or the 
same or similar employment with others, or attempts to make other arrangements 
relative to the same subject matter even with the person or corporation which 
owed him the obligation repudiated. So long as it appears with fair clearness 
that his purpose is to protect himself against the results of the repudiation, 
his acts do not constitute a waiver of his rights under the obligation 
repudiated, nor do they estop him from making a claim by reason of its breach. 
The waiver will not be presumed; and, if the intention to waive or release is 
denied, such waiver or release must be proved by the party alleging it by a 
preponderance of the evidence.</p>
<p>The legitimate object of a demand is to enable the party upon whom it is made 
to perform his contract and discharge his liability agreeable to the nature of 
it without a suit at law; and whenever such party wholly denies the right of the 
other to assert title in himself or unqualifiedly refuses performance of the 
obligation, a demand is made useless, and therefore unnecessary, since <em>lex 
neminem cogit ad vana.</em> For the same reason and upon the same principle the 
failure to make a demand before suit may be cured by proof that the defendant 
could not have complied with the demand if it had been made; as where a person 
contracts to assign his interest in certain lands to another within a specified 
time upon payment of consideration therefor, and the vendor prior to the 
stipulated time assigns his interest to a stranger. In such case a request by 
the vendee for the performance of the contract is unnecessary. The rule stated 
otherwise is to the effect that where a party bound to the future performance of 
a contract puts it out of his power to perform it, the other party may treat 
this as a breach and sue him at once, having thus an immediate right of action 
for breach of the contract by anticipation.</p>
<p>It may not be amiss, perhaps, to note that the defendant company was in no 
way injured by the acts of the plaintiff complained of. There resulted no damage 
directly nor did the company change position to its disadvantage by reason of 
his affirmative acts or of his neglect, if there were such, to demand a renewal 
prior to the termination of the first year under the agreement.</p>
<p>It may be noted also that the plaintiff was under no obligation to defendant 
with respect to a renewal of the contract. The obligation was wholly on the side 
of the defendant. Therefore, in doing whatever he did to obtain other 
employment, he was not violating any obligation which he owed to the defendant 
and, therefore, gave it no legal reason for complaint. The plaintiff had a right 
to look about for a better situation and to seek to improve his condition with 
respect to the period embraced within the second year referred to in the 
contract. We do not believe that the contract should be construed to deny 
plaintiff the ordinary opportunities which men have for the betterment of their 
condition, especially after the other party to the contract has repudiated it. 
Even though one is engaged in the performance of a contract which he has with 
another, that fact does not require him to stand still and refrain from all 
attempts to improve his condition, after the termination of the contract which 
he is engaged in performing, for fear that such activities will preclude him 
from enforcing obligations which the other owes' him. At the time of the 
activities of the plaintiff complained of the time had not yet arrived when 
plaintiff was bound to exercise his option, if it may be called an option, with 
respect to the second year referred to in the contract. Defendant was in no way 
misled and in no way injured by plaintiff's activities.</p>
<p>The remaining question relates to plaintiff's damages.</p>
<p>The plaintiff claims his damage to be P10,800, basing that claim upon the 
profits which he would have received if he had continued the business for the 
second year.</p>
<p>The appellee makes no objection to this amount, the question of the amount of 
damages not having been referred to in its brief. It is the practice of this 
court, in case of reversal of a judgment dismissing the complaint on the merits, 
to examine the evidence and enter or order entered the judgment which the 
inferior court should have rendered; and, where the action is for a sum of money 
or damages, to find from the evidence the amount due or the damages suffered and 
to render or order the trial court to render judgment for that amount. We assume 
that that practice is thoroughly understood and that if appellee had had any 
objection to urge as to the amount of damages which should be awarded to the 
plaintiff in case judgment should be found for him in this court, it would have 
presented it in its brief.</p>
<p>The only damages claimed relate to profits. Articles 1106 and 1107 of the 
Civil Code read as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Indemnity for losses and damages includes not only the amount of the loss 
which may have been suffered, but also that of the profits which the creditor 
many have failed to realize, reserving the provisions contained in the following 
articles.</p>
<p>"The losses and damages for which a debtor in good faith is liable, are those 
foreseen or which may have been foreseen, at the time of constituting the 
obligation, and which may be a necessary consequence of its nonfulfillment.</p>
<p>"In case of fraud, the debtor shall be liable for all those which clearly may 
originate from the nonfulfillment of the obligation."</p></blockquote>
<p>Under these provisions we are required to determine the amount of profits 
which plaintiff failed to realize by reason of the refusal of defendant to 
permit him to continue under the contract for the second year and which were 
foreseen or which might have been foreseen at the time the contract was made and 
which were a necessary consequence of the breach. Plaintiff testified that he 
made P11,000 profit the first year and that he would unquestionably have made a 
net profit of P1,200 a month if he had been left to enjoy the second year of the 
contract. There is no evidence contradicting this, and while the estimation of 
profits lost has, in most cases, some of the elements of speculation, it is 
inherent in the nature of the subject matter and not in its manner of treatment. 
As was said in the case of Ft. Smith &amp; W. R. Co. <em>vs</em>. Williams (30 
Okla., 726):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This has ever been looked upon and treated by the courts as a vexed and 
difficult question. It has been, and will always be, impossible to lay down any 
fixed and definite rule correctly applicable in all cases. There has never been 
a rule established which was decisive and universally followed by the courts in 
all cases, but the inclination of the earlier authorities to hold that 
contemplated profits per se were improper elements of damage has given way under 
the riper wisdom of jurisprudence, and, instead of holding to the earlier 
inclination, the weight of authorities in modern jurisprudence either holds or 
concedes that, where a loss of profits is not too remote or conjectural to be 
susceptible of computation with reasonable accuracy, they are proper elements of 
damage.</p>
<p>"This rule is recognized with approval by each and all of the following 
authorities cited by counsel for plaintiff in error in support of his first 
proposition: Strawn <em>vs.</em> Cogswell (28 111., 461); Frazer <em>vs.</em>

<blockquote>
<p>"None of the above authorities have held against the justness of the rule of 
applying profits as a measure of damages, but have merely held it inapplicable 
to the cases decided. There is more or less inaccuracy in every action for 
damages for breach of contract, but in order to justify a recovery in any case, 
assuming that a breach has been committed, there are two necessary elements to 
be considered: One that a damage has been done; the other that such damage is 
the result of the breach. The amount of the one should be computed with 
reasonable accuracy. The fact of the other must be determined with reasonable 
certainty. A less degree of accuracy is required in the former than of certainty 
in the latter, but neither is required to be absolute or beyond conjectural 
possibilities. Where it reasonably appears that a party has been damaged, and 
that such damage is the direct result of the breach, then a recovery is 
justified. The next step is to ascertain how much will reasonably compensate the 
injured party. This should be computed by the plainest, easiest, and most 
accurate measure which will do justice in the premises, and if from the 
conditions in the contract, and the nature of the breach, it reasonably appears 
that the extent or amount of damages may be more readily, easily, correctly, and 
justly ascertained by applying the loss of profits as a measure, if it is 
evident that profits were lost and the amount thereof can be calculated with 
reasonable accuracy, then such profits are the true measure tp be applied. In 
such cases, however, it should appear evident that profits were lost. The amount 
may be estimated with only reasonable accuracy; but the fact that profits were 
lost should require stricter proof. This doctrine is deduced from a vast weight 
of authorities, both American and English, including 2 Joyce on Damages, and

<p>In the case before us there seems to be as little speculation in determining 
the profits which the plaintiff might have recovered as is usual in cases where 
the time for which the profits are to be recovered extends over a considerable 
period of time. It is undisputed that the business was a very profitable one the 
first year and that the second year would have been more profitable than the 
first. While the estimate of the amount of profits for the second year is an 
estimate of necessity, it is one which is based upon facts testified to by the 
plaintiff, which were within his knowledge and which appear to the court to 
sustain his contention. While the evidence is not as conclusive as in cases 
where the damages are certain and capable of accurate statement, we are 
satisfied with its sufficiency, particularly in view of the fact that all that 
courts may require of litigants is the production of the best evidence of which 
the case is susceptible.</p>
<p>As to whether or not the plaintiff in an action of this character may recover 
only that portion of the profits which had accrued up to the time of bringing 
the action, or whether he may sue for all the damages resulting from the breach 
in a single action, even though that action is begun long before the period 
during which the profits will accrue has expired, we may say that, in our 
judgment, the weight of authority is to the effect that the plaintiff need bring 
but one action and that he may recover the damages sustained for the whole 
period even though it be by anticipation.</p>
<p>The principle on which the case of Pierce vs. Tennessee Coal, Iron and 
Railroad Co. (173 U. S., 1) is decided is, in our judgment, applicable to the 
case at bar. That was a case in which the plaintiff, while employed as a 
machinist in the defendant's coal mine in Alabama, was seriously hurt under 
circumstances which the plaintiff claimed, and the defendant denied, rendered it 
liable to him in damages. The parties were desirous of settling and compromising 
plaintiff's claim for damages for the injuries and, after repeated negotiations, 
they made an agreement by which the defendant was to pay to the plaintiff 
regular wages while he was disabled, to furnish him with such supplies as he 
might choose to get from the commissary, to give him coal and wood for fuel at 
his dwelling house and the benefit of a garden belonging to the defendant. The 
agreement was carried out by the defendant for some time and then it discharged 
the plaintiff from its employ before his disability ceased.</p>
<p>After discussing certain phases of the contract and declaring its nature and 
purpose, the court said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It appears to us to be equally clear that the Circuit Court of the United 
States erred in excluding the evidence offered by the plaintiff, in restricting 
his damages to the wages due and unpaid at the time of the trial, and in 
declining to instruct the jury as he requested.</p>
<p>"Upon this point the authorities are somewhat conflicting; and there is 
little to be found in the decisions of this court, having any bearing upon it, 
beyond the affirmance of the general propositions that 'in an action for a 
personal injury the plaintiff is entitled to recover compensation, so far as it 
is susceptible of an estimate in money, for the loss and damage caused to him by 
the defendant's negligence, including not only expenses incurred for medical 
attendance, and a reasonable sum for his pain and suffering, but also a fair 
recompense for the loss of what he would otherwise have earned in his trade or 
profession, and has been deprived of the capacity of earning by the wrongful act 
of the defendant,’ and, 'in order to assist the jury in making such an estimate, 
standard life and annuity tables, showing at any age the probable duration of 
life, and the present value of a life annuity, are competent evidence' 
(Vicksburg &amp; M. Railroad Co. vs. Putnam, 118 U. S., 545, 554); and that in 
an action for breach of contract 'the amount which would have been received if 
the contract had been kept, is the measure of damages if the contract is broken' 
(Benjamin <em>vs.</em> Hilliard, 23 How., 149, 167).</p>
<p>"But the recent tendency of judicial decisions in this country, in actions of 
contract, as well as in actions of tort, has been towards allowing entire 
damages to be recovered, once for all, in a single action, and thus avoiding the 
embarrassment and annoyance of repeated litigation. This especially appears by 
well considered opinions in cases of agreements to furnish support or to pay 
wages, a few only of which need be referred to."</p></blockquote>
<p>The court, after discussing Parker <em>vs.</em> Russell (133 Mass., 74), 
Schell vs. Plumb (55 N. Y., 592), East Tennessee V. &amp; G. R. Co. <em>vs.</em> 
Staub (7 Lea, 397), holding the doctrine just quoted, further said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"These cases appear to this court to rest upon sound principles, and to 
afford correct rules for the assessment of the plaintiff's damages in the case 
at bar. * * *</p>
<p>"If these facts were proved to the satisfaction of the jury, the case would 
stand thus: The defendant committed an absolute breach of the contract, at a 
time when the plaintiff was entitled to require performance. The plaintiff was 
not bound to wait to see if the defendant would change its decision, and take 
him back into its service; or to resort to successive actions for damages from 
time to time; or to leave the whole of his damages to be recovered by his 
personal representative after his death. But he had the right to elect to treat 
the contract as absolutely and finally broken by the defendant; to maintain this 
action, once for all, as for a total breach of the entire contract; and to 
recover all that he would have received in the future, as well as in the past, 
if the contract had been kept. In so doing, he would simply recover the value of 
the contract to him at the time of the breach, including all the damages, past 
or future, resulting from the total breach of the contract. The difficulty and 
Uncertainty of estimating damages that the plaintiff may suffer in the future is 
no greater in this action of contract than they would have been if he had sued 
the defendant, in an action of tort, to recover damages for the personal 
injuries sustained in its service, instead of settling and releasing those 
damages by the contract now sued on.</p>
<p>"In assessing the plaintiff's damages, deduction should, of course, be made 
of any sum that the plaintiff might have earned in the past or might earn in the 
future, as well as the amount of any loss that the defendant had sustained by 
the loss of the plaintiff's services without the defendant's 
fault."</p></blockquote>
<p>From the amount of damages proved in the case at bar there would have been 
deducted, if there had been any proof to that effect, whatever profits plaintiff 
had gained up to the time of the action or might reasonably be expected to gain 
during the period sued for. No evidence, however, has been introduced on that 
subject and we do not find it necessary to go into that question. We are of the 
opinion that the great weight of authority is to the effect that the opportunity 
to earn wages or profits in reduction of the damages claimed will not be 
presumed but must be affirmatively shown by the defendant. (Van Winkle vs.

<p>The cause is returned to the Court of First Instance whence it came with 
instructions to enter a judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against the 
defendant for the sum of P10,800, with costs in that instance but without costs 
in this. </p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres</em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p>CARSON, <em>J.,</em> concurring in the reversal of the judgment of the trial 
court, but dissenting from the final disposition of the case:</p>
<p>While I agree with the majority in reversing the judgment in the court below 
and concur in the rulings upon which the reversal is founded, I think that the 
record should be remanded for a new trial, wherein evidence as to the amount of 
damages can be taken in the light of our rulings that plaintiff is entitled to 
recover in a single action for all the damages resulting from the breach of the 
contract, and that where the loss of profits in a case of this kind is not too 
remote or conjectural to be susceptible of computation with reasonable accuracy, 
it is a proper element of damage.</p>
<p>The trial judge was of opinion that plaintiff could recover no damages in 
this action and no evidence seems to have been introduced as to "profits 
plaintiff had gained up to the time of the action or might reasonably be 
expected to gain during the period sued for" notwithstanding the breach of the 
contract. The majority opinion admits that such profits if proven, should be 
deducted from the amount of damages allowed by the judgment. I think that the 
judgment of the trial court having been reversed on the ground that the trial 
judge erred in his rulings as to the right of plaintiff to recover any damages 
at all, and this court having recognized plaintiff's right to recover and at the 
same time announced the doctrine which should be applied as to the measure of 
the damages, and the form in which proceedings should be maintained for their 
recovery, the case should be remanded to the trial court and evidence taken as 
to the true damages which should be allowed in this action, so that judgment may 
be rendered on proof not only as to the amount of the anticipated profits under 
the contract, but also as to the amount, if any, which should be deducted 
therefrom because of "profits plaintiff had gained up to the time of the action 
or might reasonably be expected to gain during the period sued for" 
notwithstanding the breach of the contract.<br></p></div>
