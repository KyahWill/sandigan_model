				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This defendant was charged with a violation of section 97 of Act No. 1189 of the Philippine Commission.&nbsp;&nbsp; The complaint was as follows:<blockquote>"On or about August 6, 1908, in the pueblo of Betis, municipality of Guagua, Province of Pampanga, the accused, being a merchant&nbsp; or trader in leaf tobacco and other raw materials used in&nbsp; the manufacture of tobacco, and having been&nbsp; required by the internal revenue agent, John Moran, to render an exact statement of the quantity of leaf tobacco and other materials sold or delivered to any person,&nbsp; did wilfully and maliciously refuse to render such exact statement, and instead made a&nbsp; false and incomplete&nbsp; one."</blockquote><p></p><p>After hearing the evidence adduced during the&nbsp; trial of the cause, the Hon. Julio Llorente, judge, found the defendant guilty of the offense charged and sentenced him to pay a fine of P300, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of&nbsp; insolvency. From that sentence the defendant appealed to this court and made several assignments of error.</p><p>Said section 97 provides that:</p><blockquote>"It shall be the duty of every farmer or planter producing leaf tobacco&nbsp; and&nbsp; of every dealer in leaf tobacco&nbsp; or any material&nbsp; used in the manufacture of tobacco or snuff, <em>on demand of any internal-revenue officer,</em> to render a true and complete statement of the quantity and amount of such leaf tobacco or other material sold or delivered to any person named in such demand; and in case of refusal or neglect to render such statement or if there is cause to believe said statement to be incorrect or fraudulent, the provincial treasurer&nbsp; or other revenue&nbsp; officer shall&nbsp; make an&nbsp; examination of such person's books,&nbsp; and papers as may be necessary to determine the facts in the case; and <em>any such dealer in leaf tobacco or other material who refuses to render a statement</em> or who renders a&nbsp; false or incomplete statement, shall for each offense be fined in a sum not exceeding four hundred pesos."</blockquote><p></p><p>It will be noted that the liability under said&nbsp; section 97 results from a refusal to render a statement on demand of&nbsp; any internal-revenue officer, or for the&nbsp; rendition of a false or incomplete statement by a farmer or planter or by a dealer in leaf tobacco or any material used in the manufacture&nbsp; of tobacco&nbsp; or snuff.&nbsp; An examination&nbsp; of the&nbsp; record brought to this court <em>fails to show&nbsp; that any internal-revenue officer ever made a demand upon the defendant to render a statement such as is required by said section&nbsp; 97;&nbsp; neither does the record disclose that&nbsp; the defendant ever rendered a false or incomplete statement. </em> In&nbsp; the absence, therefore, of proof (<em>a</em>) that a demand was made to render a statement; and (<em>b</em>) a refusal to comply with such demand, or (<em>c</em>) that he had rendered a false or incomplete statement, no liability is incurred by virtue&nbsp; of said section 97.</p><p>Therefore the&nbsp; sentence of the lower court is hereby&nbsp; reversed, the complaint is ordered to be dismissed, and the defendant is hereby ordered to&nbsp; be discharged from the custody of the&nbsp; law.</p><p><em>Arellano, C.&nbsp; J., Torres,&nbsp; Mapa, Moreland,</em> and <em>Trent, JJ.</em>,concur.</p></div>
