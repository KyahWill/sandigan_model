				G.R. No. 2768, August 28, 1906</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED  STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS.  NAZARIO VALLESTEROS, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MAPA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Of the various defendants in this case, Nazario Vallesteros was the only one  convicted,  the others having been acquitted.   The crime charged in the complaint is that of robbery  in an armed band  and it  is alleged to have been committed on the night of  the 4th of May,  1904, in the parish house  of the town  of Piddig, Province of Ilocos Norte.   The defendant  and appellant Vallesteros having been found guilty of the said crime, was sentenced  to fourteen years and eight months'  imprisonment  (<em>cadena temporal</em>),  to return the  property stolen  or to pay  its value, and to pay the costs of proceedings.</p>
<p>This conviction is not supported by the evidence of record and it can not, therefore, be sustained.   None of the eyewitnesses to the occurrence identified  the appellant as one  of the  participants in  the robbery.  None  of  them testified  that he was present at the time the  robbery was committed, or identified  him at the time  of the trial.</p>
<p>The justice of the peace who made the preliminary  investigation testified at the  trial  that one of those implicated in the robbery in  question had testified at  the said preliminary investigation that the appellant was one of those who entered the parish house of Piddig.</p>
<p>The statement of  that witness, however, was not introduced in evidence at the  trial.  Moreover, it appears  from the testimony  of one of the defendants,  which testimony has not been contradicted,  that the statement referred to by the justice of the peace had been subsequently withdrawn, during the preliminary investigation, by the person who made it.</p>
<p>The testimony of the justice of the peace is,  therefore insufficient to  establish the guilt of the  appellant.</p>
<p>Nor is the testimony of  the Constabulary sergeant, to the effect that the appellant admitted, in the presence of the provincial  fiscal and the president of  the town of Dingras, having been  forced to take part in the robbery in question, any  more sufficient to establish  such guilty participation.  In the first  place the sergeant stated that this admission  was made upon his promise to the defendant that the provincial  fiscal would  do his best  to have him acquitted.   If  this is true, then "the defendant's admission was not spontaneous, as it would  have to be in order to be admissible  in evidence.   In the second place, it  does not appear clearly from the testimony of the said sergeant whether he was present when this admission was made, or whether he learned of it through the provincial fiscal or the president of Dingras.   Finally,  if appellant participated  in the  robbery  in  question not voluntarily, but because  he  was forced, he  could  not be held criminally responsible, he being under such  circumstances exempt from such liability by the provisions of the Penal Code.</p>
<p>Nor is it proof  of the guilt of the appellant, that a gun was found on  a building lot belonging to him, as it has not been shown that the said gun was the same one used by the robbers when  the robbery  in question  was committed.</p>
<p>The  judgment appealed  from  is hereby reversed  and the appellant is acquitted with the  costs of both instances <span style="font-style: italic;">de oficio</span>.  After the expiration of ten days from the date of final judgment the case will be remanded to the court below for execution.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Carson, Willard, </em>and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
