In the registry of property, entry No. 1, city property No. 793, folio' 23 of volume 15, district of Binondo, and volume 52 of the records, it&nbsp; appears (<i>a</i>) that by a judicial decree issued on September 20, 1870, by the Court of First Instance of Intramuros, Jose Horacio, Aurora and Maria Dolores Camps, and the minor Aurelia Roman, as daughter of Josef a Camps, deceased, were declared the heirs of their late father as well as of their late grandfather respectively named Jose Camps.&nbsp; Said decree contained a clause providing for the appointment&nbsp; of Jose Camps y Montilla as guardian of the minor Aurelia Roman, and as legal representative of his brother and sisters, Aurora, Horacio, and Maria Dolores; (<i>b</i>) that by a grant&nbsp; from the&nbsp; Superior Government of&nbsp; these Islands,&nbsp; the&nbsp; intestate Jose Camps owned a parcel of land 400 Spanish yards long by 200 deep, situated on <i>Malecon del Norte</i>, district of Binondo; on said land there were built two warehouses of strong materials adjoining each other, and a dwelling house which has been destroyed, and upon which there is a mortgage in favor of the&nbsp; Obras Pias for the sum of $7,777.86;&nbsp; (<i>c</i>) that, by a judicial sale held on August 17, 1877, in the Court of First Instance of Intramuros,&nbsp; the property above referred to was sold to Manuel Alvarez, representing&nbsp; Francisco Hernandez y Fajarnes for the sum of 32,000.&nbsp; Jose Camps, jr., for himself and representing&nbsp; with sufficient power&nbsp; of attorney his brother Horacio and his sisters Aurora and Maria Dolores Camps, and in his&nbsp; capacity as guardian&nbsp; of Aurelia Roman, duly authorized to sell for&nbsp; her,&nbsp; all in their capacity as heirs&nbsp; of Jose Camps, deceased,&nbsp; executed the proper&nbsp; deed of sale in favor of&nbsp; Francisco Hernandez y Fajarnes, who in his turn&nbsp; sold the&nbsp; property in question for the same price of $32,000 to Juan Jover&nbsp; Serra, represented by Eduardo Vidal; (<i>d</i>) Juan Jover Serra died intestate in the city of Barcelona on February 22, 1879,&nbsp; and at the request of his&nbsp; widow, Maria Rosa Costas y Llucia, her two sons, Miguel and Joaquin&nbsp; Jover y Costas were, on March 7 of the same year, 1879, declared to be the heirs of the deceased,&nbsp; by the Court of First Instance of San Pedro, Barcelona; (<i>e</i>) Miguel Jover y Costas also died intestate on April 29, 1888, and his mother Maria&nbsp; Rosa Costas y Llucia, and&nbsp; his brother Joaquin were, on&nbsp; May&nbsp; 29, 1888, declared equal heirs of&nbsp; his estate by the Court of First Instance of the city of Barcelona; and&nbsp; (<i>f</i>) that, by a deed executed in the city of Barcelona before the notary Manuel Larretea y Catalan, on August 22, 1888, Maria Rosa Costas and Joaquin Jover made a partition&nbsp; of&nbsp; the estate of Miguel Jover, and agreed that that half belonging to the latter in the property mentioned should be&nbsp; given to Joaquin Jover as payment of his credit; after these partition proceedings the said Rosa&nbsp; Costas and Joaquin&nbsp; Jover executed another deed, in which they set forth that Joaquin and&nbsp; his late brother Miguel Jover had constructed two warehouses at their&nbsp; expense&nbsp; on the land, bounded&nbsp; as&nbsp; per the summary information approved November 17,&nbsp; 1888, and registered&nbsp; December&nbsp; 6&nbsp; of the same year in the office of the notary Enrique Barrera; that the said&nbsp; warehouses and land belonged to the brothers Miguel and Joaquin Jover in equal shares, and that the share belonging to the former became the property of the latter by virtue of the said&nbsp; deed of partition.<br><br>"2. In the second registration of the property in question it is set forth that, as an addition to the property of Joaquin Jover y Costas, two buildings&nbsp; were erected on the land, one consisting of two warehouses of strong materials, forming a single building, and the other being another warehouse with a galvanized-iron roof, respectively valued at 8,000 and 3,500 pesos.<br><br>"3. On the margin&nbsp; of the first registration entry the mortgage credit existing on the building appears as canceled, as per marginal notes on folios 125,&nbsp; 13&nbsp; and 32 <i>(vuelto)</i> of the suppressed books of the abolished <i>anotaduria de hipotecas.</i><br><br>"4. Certain data and particulars of the first registration are corroborated by a deed of sale executed before the notary Numeriano Adriano, on September 5, 1877.<br><br>"5. The documents examined show that the owner of the estate is Joaquin Jover y Costas.&nbsp; The present boundaries may be admitted as true.<br><br>"6. No acts or contracts opposing the petitioner's title appear in the registry of property, nor have any facts contrary to those stated in the petition developed from the investigations made.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">"OPINION.<br></div><br>"Based on&nbsp; the foregoing report, I am of opinion that the title of Joaquin Jover y&nbsp; Costas is valid and may be registered.<br><br>"Manila, January 26, 1904.<br><br><div style="text-align: right;">"AGUEDO VELARDE."</div></blockquote>On the 13th day of April, 1904, the city of Manila, by its attorney, filed in said court its opposition to the&nbsp; registration of said&nbsp; land in favor of the petitioner, basing said opposition&nbsp; upon the ground that the said land was within the limits of the city of Manila and that it belonged to the public domain.<br><br>On the same day the then Acting Attorney-General for the Philippine Islands, representing the Insular Government of the Philippine Islands, presented his objection to the registration of the said land in favor of the petitioner, upon the ground that the land constituted a part of the public lands.<br><br>The issue being thus formed, the case was duly tried, and after hearing the evidence adduced during the trial of said cause the&nbsp; said Court of Land Registration&nbsp; granted the registration of that part of said&nbsp; land within the letters A.-B.-C.-D.-U.-L.-K.-N.-P. as represented on the plan presented by the petitioner as a part of his petition and refused to register in favor of the petitioner the balance of the lands included in said plan.<br><br>From this&nbsp; decision the petitioner and the Insular&nbsp; Government each appealed.<br><br>The petitioner and appellant made the following assignments&nbsp; of error:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">"I.<br></div><br>"The court erred by stating that the concession 200 <span style="font-style: italic;">brazas</span> long and&nbsp; 100<span style="font-style: italic;"> brazas</span> wide on the place marked therein was not absolute.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">"II.<br></div><br>"The court erred by declaring that, even supposing that the concession was conditional, the condition has not&nbsp; been complied with.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">"III.<br></div><br>"The court erred in determining that the concession was only for the portion 'which is&nbsp; or may be filled in' within the limits of the concession.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">"IV.<br></div><br>"The court erred in declaring that a Spanish conditional concession of lands might be impugned after the treaty of Paris, and that the entry in the registry of property might be canceled."</blockquote>The Insular Government, respondent and appellant, made the following assignments of error:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">"I.<br></div><br>"The court erred in stating in its decision that the question raised by the parties is reduced to a determination of whether the concession of the&nbsp; land granted by&nbsp; the&nbsp; late Spanish Government has expired, and whether said land has been transferred in its entirety to the petitioner, Juan [ Joaquin] Jover y Costas.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">"II.<br></div><br>"The court erred in not declaring that the concession of the land, which is the subject-matter of this case, granted by the Governor-General of the Philippines in favor of Jose Camps, is null and void.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">"III.<br></div><br>"Even admitting the validity of the concession made to Jose Camps, the court erred in not holding that such concession&nbsp; in its entirety&nbsp; was granted under&nbsp; the conditions and limits expressed in the grant, and especially under the condition that the land granted would be filled in, and that the concession would not produce its effects&nbsp; until such condition had been complied with.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">"IV.<br></div><br>"The court erred in not declaring that the concession made to Jose Camps has completely expired, the latter having failed to comply with the condition of filling in all the land granted by said concession.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">"V.<br></div><br>"Finally, the court erred in not declaring null and void the entry in the registry of property as regards the whole of the land granted, instead of only that as to. the portion of the same not filled in.</blockquote>The petitioner and appellant contends that he is the absolute owner of the land in question.&nbsp; He bases this contention upon the following facts:<br><br>First.&nbsp; That the Spanish Government on the 12th day of February, 1859, conceded to Jose Camps the absolute right and title to the possession of said land,&nbsp; which grant was evidenced by the following document:<br><blockquote>"Don Jose Luis de Baura y Soriano, lawyer of this royal court of chancery, knight of the Military Order of San Juan of Jerusalem; member of the Royal Economical Society of 'Friends of the Country;' member of the general commission of statistics; and secretary of the superior civil government of these Islands, etc.<br><br>"I certify that on the petition filed by Don Jose Camps, <i>oficial primero jubilado</i> at this office, in which petition he asks for the concession of a piece of land, 200 <i>brazas</i> long and 100 <span style="font-style: italic;">brazas</span> wide, in the lowland back of the northern wharf (<i>Murallon del Norte</i>) of the Pasig River, the superior decree, hereinafter set forth, was issued&nbsp; on February 12,&nbsp; 1859:<br><br>" 'Acting upon the petition in which Don Jose Camps on November 17, 1858, solicited a grant&nbsp; for the&nbsp; land which he fills in at his&nbsp; expense on the&nbsp; lowlands situated along the northern wharf <i>(Murallon del Norte)</i>&nbsp; and on the north side thereof, on the right side of the mouth of the Pasig River with an extension of 200 <i>brazas</i> in length&nbsp; and 100 brazas in width, beginning at&nbsp; a distance of 25 <i>varas</i> (Spanish yards) west of the bridge built on&nbsp; said wharf for the connection of the waters pf the river and&nbsp; of the bay from the beach of Binondo, as appears on the plan hereto&nbsp; attached, to which land, after it has&nbsp; been&nbsp; filled in, he intends to move his artistic establishment called "Camps e Hijos," and a manufactory of hemp rope; in view of the report made on&nbsp; the&nbsp; 26th of the said month of November by the<i> Alcalde Mayor 1°</i> of Manila, who, after consultation with the director of public works of the province, is of the opinion&nbsp; that the waste land asked for should be granted to Camps, said land being at present covered by the sea, and being far from the houses situated on the Binondo beach, it is very suitable for purposes of maritime&nbsp; commerce and is convenient for the purpose&nbsp; of public adornment, that the foundry, ironworking, and scientific instrument establishment of Camps e Hijos be located at&nbsp; that place, provided that the said Camps shall agree not to erect such building with brick and stone or strong materials, for the reason that the same is outside of the military lines: in view of the report made on December 17, 1858, by the commanding general of marine, in&nbsp; agreement with&nbsp; the captain of the port, regarding the convenience of such concession for the merchant marine and public adornment, but with the precise condition that Camps "shall leave a distance of 16½ <i>varas</i> between the&nbsp; outside edge of&nbsp; the wharf and the intended building, which width is the one fixed for wharves; in view also of the report of the subinspector of engineers, with the approval of the commander of the post, proposing that the concession asked for shall not be granted for a&nbsp; building of strong materials, on account of the forts of the place, and that the building to be erected shall consist of only one story, and shall be removed at the expense of its owner at the discretion of the superior authority of the Islands, when the public interests so require, taking&nbsp; into&nbsp; consideration the circumstances&nbsp; and official and industrial merits of the said Bon Jose Camps, and the offer of protection&nbsp; stated in the decree dated November 4, 1858, when refusing the sale, asked&nbsp; for by him, of an irregular piece of land adjoining the new <i>Cuartel del Carenero</i>, and in conformity with the above-mentioned reports of the commanding general of marine, the&nbsp; subinspector of engineers, and&nbsp; the civil chief of the Province of Manila, I hereby decree:&nbsp; Don Jose Camps, <i>comisario de guerra honorario,&nbsp; oficial mayor jubilado</i> of the office of the secretary of this superior government, and director of the ironworking and nautical instrument establishment of Camps e Hijos, <i>is granted the possession and ownership of a parcel of land 200 "brazas" in length and 100 "brazas" in width, covered at present by the waters of the sea? near the&nbsp; Binondo beach, which land is situated alongside the "Murallon del Norte," and requested authority to fill in the same at his expense is also hereby granted, subject&nbsp; to the following conditions and restrictions:</i><br><br>" 'First. The land to be filled in shall form a quadrangle 200 <i>brazas</i> long, and 100 <i>brazas</i> wide; beginning on the longer aide, nearest&nbsp; to the Pasig River, at a point 25 <i>varas</i> from the bridge connecting the waters of the river and of the bay, and running parallel with the wharf toward the light-house.<br><br>" 'Second.&nbsp; The buildings to be erected by Camps on this new land so granted shall be located along the said longer side parallel to the breakwater, separated from the edge of the exterior wharf for its whole length, a distance&nbsp; of 16½ <i>varas</i>, which is the width required for wharves.<br><br>" 'Third. The said buildings shall consist of only one story, no materials of the kind.prohibited in the military zone shall be employed therein, and they shall be roofed with zinc, tarred paper, <i>nipa</i>, or other similar materials.<br><br>" 'Fourth.&nbsp; The said buildings shall be removed at the expense of Don Jose Camps or his. successors whenever,&nbsp; at the discretion of the superior authority of the Islands, the military service so requires.&nbsp; Let the interested party be notified and a certified copy be issued to him.<br><br><div style="text-align: right;">" 'NORZAGARAY.'<br></div><br>"At the request of the interested party I issue these presents at Manila, on the first day of July, eighteen hundred and sixty-two.<br><br>"Signed.<br><br>"There is a seal reading: 'General Office of the Secretary of the Superior Government of the Philippines.'"</blockquote>Second. That on the 17th day of August, 1877, the said land, having become the property of the heirs of the said Jose Camps, was sold by said heirs to Juan Jover y Serra.<br><br>Third. That sometime on or about the 22d day of August, 1888, the estate of the said Juan Jover was duly settled and the property in question, under the&nbsp; division of his estate, became the property of his son, Joaquin Jover y Costas, the petitioner herein.<br><br>Fifth. That the original grantee, Jose Camps, and his successive&nbsp; grantees, have been in the actual, peaceable, quiet, and uninterrupted possession of said land since the said 12th day of February, 1859.<br><br>Sixth.&nbsp; That the title to said land had been duly registered in the registry of property, of the Province of Manila.<br><br>Seventh.&nbsp; That at the time of the purchase of the land in question by Juan Jover, the father of the present petitioner, due inquiry was made by him or his representative, of the representatives of the Spanish Government, then existing in the Philippine Islands, concerning the validity of the original grant to the said Jose Camps, and he was informed by each of them that the said grant was made with authority and was valid.&nbsp; (See testimony of Eduardo Vidal, record, pp. 82, 89.)<br><br>Eighth. That relying upon the validity of the title obtained under the above grant by the said Jose Camps, the petitioner and his ancestor paid for the said land&nbsp; the sum of 32,000 pesos.<br><br>Ninth.&nbsp; That relying in good faith upon his title thus obtained the petitioner has made improvements upon the said land, so that now, according to the assessing authorities of the city of Manila, the land with such improvements is valued&nbsp; at $255,578, United States currency, or the sum of $511,156.<br><br>Tenth.&nbsp; That the Spanish Government fully recognized the title of the predecessor of the present petitioner—<br><br>(1) By making an express grant of said land to the said Jose Camps; and<br><br>(2) By permitting the said Camps and his successors to register the said title in the registry of property, thus holding&nbsp; out and representing to third persons&nbsp; that the petitioner&nbsp; and his predecessors were&nbsp; the real owners of and entitled to the possession of said land&nbsp; as against all&nbsp; the world.<br><br>The contention of the respondent and appellant, in effect, is that the said grant above quoted was made without authority, and was therefore null, and that the predecessor of the present petitioner acquired no&nbsp; rights in said land.<br><br>The lower court held, in effect, that the grant was valid, but that it was conditional, and that the grantee Jose Camps and his successors only had acquired ownership to so much of the land included in the original grant as he and they had actually reclaimed and terreplained, and that the part of said grant which had not been reclaimed had not passed to the said Jose Camps and his successors, but still constituted a part of the public domain.<br><br>The contention of the petitioner and appellant is that the original grant was&nbsp; valid; that the authority to make said grant was fully justified; that said grant was not conditional but was absolute, and that the absolute title with the right to possession of all the lands mentioned in said grant passed, without condition or limitation, to the said Jose Camps.<br><br>The United States Government has from time to time acquired large tracts of territory, with the right to govern the same, from the Government of Spain.&nbsp; In each of the various Sessions, made by the Government of Spain to the United States, there have been found numerous tracts&nbsp; of land ceded by the representatives of the Spanish Government to private persons.&nbsp; Many&nbsp; of&nbsp; these cessions to private persons, at the time of&nbsp; the&nbsp; transfer of the property to the United States Government, had not been completed; in other words, at the time the United States Government took possession of these various grants of property, it found private1 persons laying claim to certain tracts or parcels of land, claiming under grants made by the representatives of the Spanish&nbsp; Government, but who had&nbsp; not complied technically with all of the conditions of said grants.&nbsp; However, it has been the policy of the Government of the United States, in every instance where it was possible, to respect such grants and to protect such persons in the interest which&nbsp; they had acquired from said Spanish Government. Instances without number might be cited to support this statement.&nbsp; The United States Government, through its courts, has presumed, whenever it found a grant of land made by a representative of the Spanish Government, that the person making such grant had authority so to do, unless the party disputing the grant presented positive proof to the contrary.&nbsp; The United States Supreme Court has frequently decided that "public acts of public officers, purporting to be exercised in an official capacity and by public authority, shall not be presumed to be usurped, <i>but that the legitimate authority had&nbsp; been previously given or subsequently ratified."</i>&nbsp; To adopt a contrary rule would lead to infinite confusion and uncertainty of titles.&nbsp; The presumption arising from the grant itself makes it prima facie evidence of the power of the officer making it and throws the burden of proof on the party denying it.<br><br>In the present case, the respondent and appellant presented no proof in the court below showing or tending to show that the said grant was made without authority.<br><br>The Supreme Court discussed at length, in the case of United States <i>vs.</i> Clarke (8 Pet., 436), the powers of the Spanish&nbsp; Governors and other Spanish officers to grant lands within the colonies,&nbsp; and there held that such governors and such Spanish officers, as a general&nbsp; rule, within the colonies, had full authority to grant title to lands, and that Such authority was without restriction as to quantity. Such governors had full authority to grant title to lands without restriction, and these grants have always been respected by the United States Government.<br><br>In support of this general policy adopted by the Government of the United States, we desire to call attention&nbsp; to the following cases: U. S. <i>vs.</i> Arredondo, 6 Pet., 691; U. S. <i>vs.</i> Percheman, 7 Pet., 51; U. S. <i>vs.</i> Clarke, 8 Pet., 436; U. S. <i>vs.</i> Sibbald, 10 Pet, 313; U. S. <i>vs.</i> Levi,&nbsp; 8 Pet., 479; U. S. <i>vs</i>. Segui,&nbsp; 10 Pet, 306; U. S. <i>vs.</i> Chaires, 10 Pet, 308; U. S. <i>vs</i>. Seton, 10 Pet., 309; Fremont <i>vs.</i> V. S., 17 How., 542-576; Pacheco <i>vs.</i> U. S., 68 U. S., 282; More <i>vs.</i> Steinbach, 127 U. S., 70.<br><br>In the present case, the grant of land to Jose Camps was made by a proper authority of the Spanish Government in the Philippine&nbsp; Islands.&nbsp; The Government received&nbsp; what to it was a full compensation for the land and delivered the same to him, at the same time executing and delivering tor him a document in which the Government fully indicated that&nbsp; the land was&nbsp; granted to him without any reservation whatever.&nbsp; Under this grant, Jose Camps&nbsp; went into possession and had&nbsp; the same surveyed&nbsp; and properly segregated from the public domain.<br><br>After the date of said grant the Spanish Government continued to control the Philippine Islands for a period of nearly forty years, allowed the original grantee and his successors to continue in possession, to make valuable improvements thereon without making any objection&nbsp; whatever to the validity of the original grant.&nbsp; We believe that any objection made on the part of the Government of the Philippine Islands, after the lapse of nearly forty years, during which time the original grantee and his successors have been in the quiet, peaceable, and uninterrupted possession of said land, under an express grant of the Spanish Government, is contrary to the spirit of the United States Government and contrary to the policy which it has heretofore adopted in dealing with lands,&nbsp; the title to which had been granted to private individuals by the Spanish Government.<br><br>The grant of February 12, 1859, was absolute to a definite tract of land and no conditions precedent or subsequent were&nbsp; imposed.&nbsp; The&nbsp; grantee was required to do nothing in order to make said grant to said tract of land complete.&nbsp; He&nbsp; has expended large sums of money upon the same, believing that the Government would protect him in the title which he had, and which had been granted without reserve and without condition to his predecessor.<br><br>We have said that it was the policy of the Government of the United States to maintain grants of land made to private persons by the Spanish Government in territory acquired by it.&nbsp; It is not necessary, however, to rest our conclusions upon a mere policy adopted by the Government of the United States upon the theory that the Spanish officers&nbsp; making such grants had authority, for the reason that we find abundant express authority applicable to the Philippine Islands on the part of the officer making the grant in question to justify his authority in so doing.<br><br>It is manifest that the validity of a concession like the one in question must depend upon the authority of the Governor-General, in his capacity of superior civil governor, to make&nbsp; it.<br><br>The governor and captain-general was the direct representative of the King in this Archipelago.&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to&nbsp; determine the questions presented, it is necessary&nbsp; to ascertain first the authority of the latter, because if the King could not make the grant, clearly he could not delegate such authority to his representative.<br><br>On both of these points, to wit, the authority of the King and the delegation thereof to the governor-general, I am content&nbsp; to rest my opinion on the following authorities found quoted in the brief and written argument of Hon. W. A. Kincaid,&nbsp; one of the attorneys for the petitioner :<br><blockquote>"The preamble of title 1 of <i>Partida 2</i> reads:<br><br>" 'Emperors and kings are the most noble men and honorable persons, invested with powers, more than anybody else, to maintain and keep their kingdoms in justice, as we have said in the beginning of this <i>Partida</i> *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *"<br><br>"And Law 5, of the same title of the same <i>Partida</i>, reads:<br><br>" '<i>Kings are representative's</i> of God in their respective kingdoms, appointed over the people in order to maintain them in justice and in truth regarding temporal affairs, as is an emperor in is empire *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *.&nbsp; <i>And the saints said that the king is placed on earth in place of God, in order to comply with justice and to give to every one his rights.'</i><br><br>"Law 8, of the same title and <i>Partida</i>, speaking of kings, says:<br><br>" 'For they are not only the lords of their kingdoms during their lives, but they may leave the same to their heirs at their death, because they possess such seignory&nbsp; by inheritance, which can not be done by emperors, who obtain the same by election, as has been said.&nbsp; And, moreover, the <i>King may give a town or a castle of his kingdom, by way of inheritance, to whomsoever he may wish,</i> which an emperor can not do, because he is obliged to increase his empire, and never reduce the same; in the same manner, the King might grant such property by feudal tenure to anyone he wished in consideration of some service performed&nbsp; or promised&nbsp; to&nbsp; be performed by the latter.&nbsp; We hold also that the King may utilize the services or help of his people when necessary, in many ways, which the&nbsp; emperor can not do.'<br><br>"In Law 5, of the same title and <i>Partida</i>, it is said:<br><br>"'And wise men naturally said that <i>the King is the head of the kingdom</i>, for, as the senses are derived from the&nbsp; head, by which senses all members of the body are governed, in the same way, all members of the&nbsp; kingdom must be ordered and led&nbsp; by the order derived from the King, who <span style="font-style: italic;">is the lord and the head&nbsp; of all of them</span>, and they must agree with him in order to obey and protect him, and to preserve and increase the kingdom.&nbsp; <i>Hence, he is, the soul and head, and they are the members.'</i><br><br>"That is to say, on the date in question, the Spanish King Mas the viceregent of God in his&nbsp; dominions, the same as the superior civil governor of the Philippines was with respect to the King.&nbsp; In this sense, Law 5, title 3, book 3, Laws of the Indies, was enacted, which reads as follows:<br><br>" 'It is our will, and we order that the viceroys of Peru and New&nbsp; Spain be the governors of the provinces under their charge, and that they rule and govern the same in our name, and <span style="font-style: italic;">make rewards, favors, and pardons</span> which they may deem to be convenient *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *'<br><br>"In Law 2, title 3, book 3 of the Laws of the Indies, it is said:<br><br>" 'Those who are to be appointed viceroys of Peru and New&nbsp; Spain shall have&nbsp; the conditions and qualifications required by an office of so great importance and dignity; and&nbsp; after they have commenced to perform their duties *&nbsp; *&nbsp; * <i>they shall do what they may think and consider to he suitable, and provide for everything we might do and pro ride for, of whatever quality&nbsp;

*&nbsp; *'<br><br>"The royal order of February 18, 1835, addressed to the captain-general of the Island of Cuba, reads:<br><br>" 'YOUR EXCELLENCY : Her Majesty, the governing Queen, has been informed of the contents of your letter of the 25th of November&nbsp;

on the 16th of the same month, in reply to the royal order of April 12 of last year asking him for a report on this matter, Her Majesty <i>has declared that the duties and&nbsp; powers of the civil governor of the island arc to be exercised by you in your capacity as captain-general</i> *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *.'<br><br>"This royal order giving to the captain-general the character of civil governor for the island does nothing <i>but ratify the supreme authority already conferred on&nbsp; the former</i> (according&nbsp; to Zamora y Coronado in his Legislacion Ultramarina, p. 292, vol. 3, edition of 1845), 'to secure public peace, good order, policing and government, the security of the persons and property of the inhabitants of the island, the publication and punctual execution of the laws and orders of the superior government, and in general, everything touching public order and <i>the greatest prosperity of the territory&nbsp;

But, as said provinces became sufficiently inhabited and&nbsp; ennobled, it was deemed&nbsp; convenient that, at least in the principal ones, governors of a higher designation be appointed, with the title of viceroys, who would justly&nbsp; perform&nbsp; the duties of&nbsp; presidents of the <i>Audiencias</i> therein, and who would hold solely under their charge the government of those wide kingdoms and of all military operations that might occur therein, as captains general of the same and who, finally, <i>might do, and would actually do, and who might take and would actually&nbsp; take care of all those things that the Royal Person would do and take care of, if he were present,</i> and which they might deem suitable for the conversion and protection of the natives, the propagation&nbsp; of the Holy Gospel, political administration, and&nbsp; for the&nbsp; peace, tranquillity, and increase of all spiritual and temporal affairs.<br><br>" 'The first governors appointed <i>were given particular instructions as to their conduct therein; which instructions were gradually extended, and are so full and complete&nbsp; that they do not seem&nbsp; to have failed to foresee, or to&nbsp; provide everything necessary </i>for the exercise of their duties piously, cautiously, and prudently, the greater part of said instructions being compiled in the Laws&nbsp; of the Indies.<br><br>" 'In the provinces under their command and in all cases and matters not specially excepted, <i>they have and exercise the same&nbsp; powers as the king appointing them, and this jurisdiction was ordinary rather than conferred.</i><br><br><div style="text-align: center;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

prohibited *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *.'<br><br>"On account of certain differences having arisen between governors-general of <i>Ultramar</i> and deputy superintendents of finance, the royal order of March 4, 1844, was promulgated, which reads as follows:<br><br>" 'YOUR EXCELLENCY : Her majesty, the Queen, agreeing to the proposal of the cabinet <i>(concejo de los senores ministros)</i>, has resolved that, inasmuch as there is joined to the persons of the governors-general&nbsp; <i>(gobernadores capitanes generales)</i> of these Islands the character of superior political governors (g<span style="font-style: italic;">obernadores politieos superiores</span>) for which reason <span style="font-style: italic;">they are also the superior delegates of the supreme government in all its branches</span>, and it being desirable to guard against all doubt prejudicial to good service, with respect to the prerogatives granted them by the Laws of the Indies in Book 3, to hear in certain cases matters concerning the&nbsp; royal treasury (<span style="font-style: italic;">real hacienda</span>), the said <span style="font-style: italic;">gobernadores capitanes generales</span> shall be always considered as preferred over the deputy&nbsp; superintendents of finance, the decision of any doubtful cases that may occur between both authorities being, therefore, under their control&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *'&nbsp; (Legislacion Ultramarina by San Pedro, vol. 1, p. 75.)<br><br>"This leads us very near the date in&nbsp; question.<br><br>"And in Law 9, title 17, book 4 of the Laws of the Indies, we find a text exactly applicable to the case of this grant, which reads:<br><br>"'Viceroys and the<i> audiencias shall see to what is necessary for good administration with regard to&nbsp; pastures, waters, and public buildings, and shall provide what may be deemed convenient for the occupation</i> and perpetuity of lands *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *.<br><br>"It might, perhaps, be said that, according to Laws 3 and 4, title 8, <i>Partida</i> 3, marshes formed by the overflow of the tide, on account of their being on the shore, belong to those communal things which all men may use; but, should we base such observation on the said laws, we would disregard the full powers&nbsp; of sovereignty&nbsp; of the nation, that is, of the King, 'the representative of God on earth.'<br><br>"These laws might be strictly applicable to&nbsp; private persons, but as regards the King, who acts through his viceroy, it should never&nbsp; be forgotten that no laws existed in&nbsp; the whole kingdom other than his will, and when a law or any other thing was in opposition to this will, the former had to give way to the latter, because it was the Supreme Will on the earth.&nbsp; Therefore, these laws may produce their effect only when the sovereignty of the nation, to which the seashore belongs, does not wish to order otherwise.<br><br>"This, besides being logical, has been precisely established by the supreme court of Spain in&nbsp; the following decision :<br><br>" 'That, although Laws 3 and 4, title 28, <i>Partida</i> 3, explaining and determining what are the things common to all men, and how the latter may use them, enumerate, among&nbsp; others, the sea and its shores as&nbsp; such common things,&nbsp; yet this should not&nbsp; be understood to be absolute, since several exceptions are established for the common benefit, which exceptions have been&nbsp; enacted in order to attend to the security and general&nbsp; interest of the nation, <i>and that the latter may grant the lands of such shores for improvement, whenever the&nbsp; same are not under private ownership, acquired by legitimate title</i>.'&nbsp; (Decision of May 1, 1863.)<br><br>"In another decision of April 30, 1863, it was&nbsp; also held:<br><br>" '1. That the general principle that the sea and its shores belong to all creatures in common, and that all may use&nbsp; them, which principle has been already limited in certain cases by the same laws and orders establishing the same, may be and is actually limited by administrative orders which, modifying it in its exercise, subject the same to&nbsp; special and&nbsp; determined rules granting and creating rights of possession and exclusive benefits in the place and within the limits which are granted, provided this is done by the one who has authority to order it and in such a way that the communal use is not prevented.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></div><br>" '3.<i>&nbsp; That in the time when the King used to administer the properties and interests of the nation, he was the legitimate representative of the latter.'</i><br><br>"In any case, marshes formed by the overflow of the tide, in the Indies, were specially reserved to the King, since Law 6 of the Ordenanzas de Poblaciones of Philip II, of 1523 and 1680&nbsp; (Vol. IV, p.&nbsp; 473, Legislaci6n Ultramarina by&nbsp; Coronado), provides:<br><br>&nbsp;" No territory or land for a new&nbsp; town shall be granted, nor shall one be <i>established at seaports, nor at any place,</i> which at any time might result in prejudice to our royal crown, or to the nation, <span style="font-style: italic;">because it is our will that such lands be reserved for us.</span>'<br><br>"Such reservations were made for the purpose of benefiting those who might go to inhabit them for the first time, or with the view to doing with them whatever might be the royal will, as Law 11 (<i>id.</i>, p. 474) says:<br><br>" 'Lands shall be divided by lot between the inhabitants, continuing from those corresponding to the <i>"plaza mayor," and the remainder be reserved so that we may grant the same to those who may go and found a town for the first time, or for what might be our will;</i> and we order that a&nbsp; plan of the place where&nbsp; the city is to be founded be always made.'<br><br>"In City of Galveston <i>vs.</i> Menard (23 Tex., 349), the supreme court of that State,&nbsp; after noting the rules of the Roman civil law,&nbsp; adopted in the Spanish and Mexican laws, regarding the provisions governing shore lands, which rules were cited as a defense in that case by alleging that the shore was dedicated to the public use, stated (p. 391):<br><br>" 'The Republic of Texas had the power, through&nbsp; its legislative department, to grant that part of the Galveston Bay, which lies south of the channel, usually covered with salt water, which constitute what is&nbsp; called the "flats;" and thereby vest an exclusive right in Menard&nbsp; to the&nbsp; soil thereof, and to the full ownership of the&nbsp; same, <i>just as if it had been dry land,</i><br><br>" 'This power results, as a necessary consequence of the absolute sovereignty of the republic, over the territory included in its limits.&nbsp; <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></sup>&nbsp; This claim of the republic upon&nbsp; her coast may not have been&nbsp; admitted by other nations,&nbsp; further than one marine league&nbsp; from&nbsp; the shore. (Angell,&nbsp; Tide Waters,&nbsp; 2; Vattel, 129.)&nbsp; That would very much have depended upon her power to enforce her claim,as we have seen in the case of the British seas, and&nbsp; Danish sound.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Wheaton's Law of&nbsp; Nations,&nbsp; 152-158;&nbsp; 1 Kent Com., 29.)&nbsp; But as between her own citizens, in respect to the rights to the soil, which they might respectively acquire, the boundaries prescribed and claimed by the government are conclusive.&nbsp; (Vatt., 128.) Her right to an inland bay, such as Galveston Bay, could not be disputed; both as to right of property in the unappropriated soil, and in the jurisdiction of her government.&nbsp; (<i>Id.</i>, 123, 124, 130.)<br><br>" 'In the civil law it is said that the sea, bays, and rivers, with their shores, are common, free to use of anyone, and are deemed, to belong to no one.&nbsp; (Angell, 18, 19, 178, 179.)&nbsp; Vattel on this subject, says, "The shores of the sea incontestably belong to the nation that possesses the country, of which they are a part; and they belong to the class of public things.&nbsp; If civilians have set them down as things common to all mankind,&nbsp; <i>it is only in regard to their use;</i> and we are not thence to conclude that they considered them as independent of the empire; the contrary appears, from a great number of laws.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ports and harbors are, manifestly, an appendage to, and even a part of, the country; and consequent are the property of the&nbsp; nation.&nbsp; <i>Whatever is&nbsp; said of the land itself will equally apply to them</i>, so far as respects the&nbsp; consequences of the domain, and the empire."&nbsp; (Angell, 129.)<br><br>" *&nbsp; *&nbsp; * It often happens, however, that the public use and enjoyment&nbsp; of&nbsp; this species of property may be promoted and increased&nbsp; by&nbsp; allowing&nbsp; portions of&nbsp; it to become private property;&nbsp;  If&nbsp; the government could not exercise this&nbsp; right, in severing this common property and&nbsp; appropriating portions&nbsp; of it to&nbsp; private use, it would not only curtail the ordinary powers&nbsp; which every nation&nbsp; has for self-development but it would presuppose a deficiency in the sovereign power to&nbsp; control or&nbsp; dispose of what belongs to it.'<br><br>"If a constitutional republic has these powers, with much more reason an absolute monarchy, which has no other restrictions than the will of a monarch or of his viceroy, must be invested with the same.<br><br>"In Knight <i>vs.</i> United States Land Association (142 U. S.,&nbsp; 161), the Supreme Court, speaking of the treaty of&nbsp; Guadalupe&nbsp; Hidalgo, by virtue of which the United States&nbsp; acquired the State&nbsp; of California, among other things, said (pp: 186-188) :<br><br>" *&nbsp; *&nbsp; * When the United States acquired California it was with the duty to protect all&nbsp; the&nbsp; rights and interests which were held by the pueblo&nbsp; of San Francisco under Mexico.&nbsp; The property rights of pueblos equally with those of individuals were entitled to protection, and provision was made by Congress in its legislation for their investigation and confirmation. *&nbsp; *&nbsp; * The&nbsp; duty&nbsp; of the Government and its power in the execution of its treaty obligations to&nbsp; protect the claims of&nbsp; all persons,&nbsp; natural and&nbsp; artificial,  were superior&nbsp; to&nbsp; any subsequently&nbsp; acquired rights or&nbsp; claims of the State of California,&nbsp; or&nbsp; of&nbsp; individuals. *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; Its rights were dependent upon Mexican laws,&nbsp; and when Mexico established those laws she <i>was the owner of tide lands as well as uplands, and could&nbsp; have placed the boundaries of her pueblos&nbsp; wherever she thought proper.</i> *&nbsp; *&nbsp; * The treaty of cession also stipulated for such protection.&nbsp; The obligation to which the United States thus succeeded was,of course, political&nbsp; in its character, and to be discharged in such manner, and on&nbsp; such terms, as they might judge expedient.'<br><br>"Under the common law of England and the&nbsp; United States,&nbsp; two kinds of law&nbsp; exist, called <i>jus privatum</i> and <i>jus publicum.</i>&nbsp; The former is inherent in the sovereign, who possesses&nbsp; the same as the owner, and the latter is the right, which the government or the sovereign has, to control waters in the interest of the public.&nbsp; It&nbsp; results that the States of the American Union have not only the ownership of the soil under the waters, but at the same time they have powers to regulate and control the public rights.

It is emphatically so in&nbsp; Spain and&nbsp; all&nbsp; its dominions. *&nbsp; *&nbsp; * The instructions of the King to his governors are the supreme law of the conquered&nbsp; colony; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; * A&nbsp; royal&nbsp; order, emanating from the King, is a supreme law, superseding and repealing all other preceding ones inconsistent with it.&nbsp; The Laws of the Indies have not their force as such, by any legislative authority vested in the council, their authority is by the express or implied expression of the royal will and pleasure; they must necessarily yield to an order, prescribing a new rule, conferring new powers abrogating or modifying previous ones.<br><br>" 'The principle that the acts of a king are in subordination to the laws of the country, applies only&nbsp; where there is any law of higher obligation&nbsp; than his will; the rule contended for may prevail in a British, certainly not in a Spanish province.'<br><br>"All this&nbsp; is sufficient to prove that, at the date in question, no law could be invoked against an act of the King of Spain, or of a viceroy&nbsp; representing him. "This&nbsp; case&nbsp; of U.

Gaz., 166), this court, speaking of the suspension of titles 4 and 12 of the Civil Code by the commanding general of these Islands, said:<br><br>" 'Moreover, the power of the governor-general, without such order [of the Supreme Government] to suspend the operation of the code, was well settled.&nbsp; A royal order so stating was issued at&nbsp; Madrid on September 19, 1876, and with the <i>cumplase </i> of the governor-general published in the <i>Gaceta de Manila</i> on November 15, 187(5.' Phil. Rep., 34.<br><br>"As we have already seen, the same powers existed in the governor-general of these Islands on the date of the grant in question, which powers were sufficient to actually repeal a considerable part of the Civil Code, which fact corroborates what has been stated, that no law can be&nbsp; invoked against a grant in the Philippines made by the&nbsp; Spanish King or by his viceroy.<br><br>"The&nbsp; History of the Philippines, inserted in Volume I of the Official Census, at page 390 et seq., says&nbsp; the following:<br><br><i>"'The powers given to a governor of the Philippine Islands&nbsp; were practically unlimited</i>, and&nbsp; no&nbsp; law could&nbsp; be enforced or remain in force if it was not in accordance with his views.' "</blockquote>My conclusions are therefore;<br><br>(1) That the grant in question was&nbsp; absolute and unconditional ;<br><br>(2) That the authority making the same had full power so to do;<br><br>(3) That the grant was to a definite, well-defined tract of land;<br><br>(4) That the petitioner and his predecessors have been in the quiet, peaceable, and uninterrupted possession of said land under said grant for nearly fifty years;<br><br>(5) That the Spanish Government permitted the title of the petitioner and his predecessors to be registered in the public registry of property, thereby representing to all persons that the petitioner was the owner of said land;<br><br>(6) That the petitioner has reclaimed a large portion of said land and has expended large sums of money in so doing;<br><br>(7) That the Government of the United&nbsp; States in the Philippine Islands recognized the title of the petitioner by taxing the same in the name of the petitioner.<br><br>(8)&nbsp; That the Government of the United States, if it desires to annul the grant&nbsp; made by the&nbsp; Spanish Government, must bring an action for that purpose and can not do so in a collateral proceeding;<br><br>(9) That the lower court had no&nbsp; authority to cancel the registration of the title to said property in a collateral proceeding;<br><br>(10) That the lower court erred in holding that the original grant contained a condition, to wit, that the petitioner and his predecessors were only entitled to1 so much of said tract of land as should be reclaimed.<br><br>For all of the foregoing reasons, in my opinion, the judgment of the lower court should be reversed&nbsp; and the petitioner should be permitted to register, under the Torrens system, his title to the land described in the grant of the 12th. day of February, 1859.<br><br><br><hr align="CENTER" width="60%" noshade="NOSHADE" size="1"><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;">DISSENTING</span><br></div><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">TRACEY, J., </span><br><br>Notwithstanding inferences to the contrary from some decisions by American courts, it is as a matter of history, as well settled as a matter of that nature can be, that the power to grant land under tidal waters was one expressly reserved to the King of Spain.&nbsp; The authorities cited in the briefs show that the motive of this reservation was the same as that for the exclusion of similar land from the public-domain legislation of the United&nbsp; States.&nbsp; (Mann <i>vs.</i> Tacoma Land Co., 153 U. S., 273.)&nbsp;&nbsp; The better opinion appears to be that this reserved power did not pass even to viceroys by virtue of the nature of their office, in which they may be said to have exercised the royal prerogative; much less was it transmitted to governors-general or like subordinate officials, who did not possess the royal power, in its plenitude, by personal representation, but only such powers as were delegated to them.&nbsp; Consequently the grant in question was void.&nbsp; No prescription has run in its favor as against the State, which is entitled&nbsp; to the possession of the property and the petitioner's application should&nbsp; be wholly dismissed with costs.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="NOSHADE" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 3 Phil.
