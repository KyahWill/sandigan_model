				<BR><STRONG>MAPA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> The plaintiff has brought  an action for the recovery from  the defendants, heirs of the late Don Ciriaco Demonteverde, of one-half of a sugar estate and the stock thereon, which he claims to have purchased  from the said Don Ciriaco  Demonteverde.   In  support of  his  contention as to the law of the case he attached to the complaint a public instrument which appears  to  have been executed by himself and Demonteverde, February 3, 1883, in which, according to  the plaintiff,  a stipulation is  made for a contract of partnership for the operation of the said estate, and, furthermore, a community of ownership is established with respect to the estate in  favor of the two parties to this instrument.   It does not appear that this instrument has been recorded in the registry of property.</p>
<p> Service of the complaint having been had on the defendants,  Dona  Maria  Pascuala  Dolor raised an  incidental issue as a previous question, praying that the instrument referred to be ruled out of evidence on the  ground that it had  not been recorded in the registry of property, and that it be returned to the plaintiff without leaving in the record any transcript or  copy thereof or extract  therefrom,  resting this contention  upon article  389 of  the Mortgage Law.   This  motion  was  granted by  the  judge by order of the 24th of March, 1898, against which the plaintiff  appeals.</p>
<p> The article cited is literally as follows: "From the time this law goes into operation the ordinary and special courts and the Government offices will not admit any document or instrument by which rights subject to inscription according to this law are constituted, transmitted, acknowledged,  modified,  or extinguished, unless  recorded  in the register, <em>if the object of the presentation of such document is to enforce, to  the prejudice of a  third person, a right which should have been recorded.</em>"</p>
<p> In view of the latter part of this article, the question has been raised in this incidental issue whether the defendants, as heirs of Don Ciriaco Demonteverde, can and should be regarded as third persons for the purposes  of the Mortgage Law, with respect to  the contract executed by  Demonteverde  and   evidenced by the  instrument   above mentioned.</p>
<p> The  Mortgage  Law itself, in article 27, gives the definition of a third  person, which is, "he who has  not  taken part in the act or contract recorded."</p>
<p> According to this the parties to a contract are not third persons;  consequently, Demonteverde  was  not a  third person with respect to the contract entered into by him and evidenced by  the instrument in question.   He  not  being such a third person, neither can his  heirs be so regarded, nor should  they be so  regarded with respect  to the same contract, because they are only the juridical continuation of his personality, they having been surrogated, by virtue of the right of succession, to all his rights  and obligations, in accordance with provisions  of article 661  of the Civil Code.</p>
<p> This doctrine, which is a mere consequence of the general principles of law, has  received express sanction in  the decisions of the supreme court of Spain.   In its judgment of the 27th of January, 1881, the latter held that acts, both in court and out, consented to by the person who lawfully took part therein,  are effective  with  respect to the heirs or successors of such  parties, who are not to be regarded as third persons for this purpose;  and in its judgment of the  28th of  January, 1892,  it was decided by the  same court that heirs are nothing more than  the continuation of the legal personality of their decedent and can not  be considered in any degree as third persons within the meaning of article 27 of the Mortgage Law.</p>
<p> The defendants,  therefore, are not third  persons with respect, to the contract entered into by their  decedent, Don Ciriaco  Demonteverde, in the instrument of February 3, 1883, and they therefore can not avail themselves of the prohibition contained  in article 389 of the Mortgage Law for the purpose of  opposing  the  admission of this instrument as evidence in the case, because not recorded in the registry  of property.   This  prohibition  was  established solely and exclusively in favor of those  who, within the meaning of that law, are third persons.  Were it otherwise, the position of the* defendants would be superior to that of the person from whom they  derived their rights, because lie,  not being a third  person,  could  not set up such  an exception.  This  would  certainly be most illogical  from a legal point of view, in view of  the fact that the heir is, as above stated, a mere continuation of the civil personality of his decedent.</p>
<p> The defendants not  being third persons, it becomes unnecessary to decide whether the instrument referred  to  is or is not subject to inscription in accordance with article 2 of the Morignge Law, because, at all events, and however this may he,  the mere  failure to record the instrument in the registry of property can not be a  bar  to its  admission as evidence in this case, as the action is not brought against a third person in the sense of this word as used in the law referred to.</p>
<p> Consequently we reverse and annul the order of the court below, overruling  the motion  made  on behalf of Dona Maria Pascuala Dolor, without  special condemnation ,as to the costs of either instance.  So ordered.</p>
<p> <em>Arellano, C. J., Cooper, Willard,</em> and <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em> Torres, J.,</em> did not sit in this case.</p>
