				<H3>MACONDRAY & CO., PLAINTIFF, VS. J. M. QUINTERO, JUSTICE OF THE PEACE OF THE CITY OF MANILA, AND R. G. RICOY, DEFENDANTS.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is an action of mandamus brought originally in this court.   On the  10th  day of  May, 1906, the plaintiff recovered a judgment against the defendant, Ricoy, in the court of the defendant, Quintero, a justice of the peace of this city.   Ricoy  attempted  to appeal from that judgment and presented  an instrument which he claimed was an obligation such as is required by section 88 of the Code of Civil Procedure.  The justice of the peace approved the bond and sent the papers to  the Court of First Instance. On the 21st day of July that court made an order to the effect that the instrument presented was not such an obligation as the law required and,  upon the motion of the plaintiff, remanded the case to  the court of the justice of the peace.   From  this order or judgment Ricoy  did  not appeal.</p>
<p>The object of the present suit is, to secure a mandamus compelling the justice  of the peace to issue an execution upon the judgment rendered by him on the ground that it is still in force.  The  defendants have appeared and answered, and the plaintiff has demurred to the answers and the case is now before us for determination of the questions presented by these demurrers.</p>
<p>(1)  An appeal from a  judgment of the justice of  the peace is not  perfected, and that judgment  is not vacated until a bond or obligation such as is required by law has been filed in that court.</p>
<p>(2) While the justice of the  peace has the right to determine the question as to the sufficiency of the sureties, he has  no right to  determine  conclusively whether  the instrument is or is not such a bond or  obligation as is required by law.</p>
<p>(3) In  the present case the  Court of First  Instance decided  by a final judgment  or  order which was not appealed from that no sufficient bond or obligation  had ever been given for the purposes of the appeal.  Whether that decision is right or wrong (and in view of the case of Mejia <em>vs</em>. Alimorong,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> [3 Off. Gaz.,  620], it would seem to  have been wrong)  is of no importance in this case.   That order or judgment is still in force, unappealed from, and it settles the rights of the parties in this case  with  reference to the validity  of that instrument.</p>
<p>(4) No sufficient  bond or obligation having been given in the court below according to the law established in this case and settled by  that final order, the judgment of the justice of the peace has never been vacated  and is still in force and can be executed.  The demurrers to  the answers of the respective defendants  are sustained and  they are each of.them given  a period of five days from the date of the notice of this resolution  in  which  to amend.  If  no amended answers  are filed within that time, the clerk, without  further order from this court, will render  final judgment in this case in favor of the plaintiff  and against the defendants  for the relief demanded in the complaint, with costs against the defendant Ricoy.   So ordered.</p>
