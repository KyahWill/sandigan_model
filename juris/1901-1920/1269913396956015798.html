				<H3>LEONARDO LUCIDO AND ROMAN LUCIDO, PLAINTIFFS AND APPELLEES, VS. ROMUALDO VITA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.

				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On the 12th of August, 1911, the said appellees presented the following motion, asking for the dismissal of&nbsp; the appeal in the present case.&nbsp; <blockquote><p>"Now&nbsp; come the&nbsp; appellees and&nbsp; respectfully represent to the honorable Supreme&nbsp; Court that the above-entitled cause is of the original jurisdiction&nbsp; of the justice&nbsp; of&nbsp; the peace court of&nbsp; Nagcarlang, La Laguna,&nbsp; in which court&nbsp; the action was first brought; that subsequently, through appeal, it was forwarded to the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of La Laguna, where the same was tried and decided&nbsp; by virtue of that court's appellate jurisdiction;&nbsp; that in&nbsp; view of the nature of this cause, the judgment of the Court of First Instance is final&nbsp; and conclusive&nbsp; and, consequently, nonappealable. Therefore the appellees respectfully pray this&nbsp; honorable court&nbsp; to declare the appeal improperly admitted and&nbsp; to assess the costs against the appellant."</p></blockquote><p>Said motion was duly set down for hearing, and on the 26th of August, 1911, it was denied in the following terms:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"The&nbsp; court,&nbsp; upon deciding&nbsp; the&nbsp; motion&nbsp; presented by Sr. Diokno in Case No. 7258,&nbsp; Leonardo Lucido et al. vs. Romualdo Vita, for the recovery of a sum of money, wherein he asked that the appeal be declared to have been improperly admitted for the reason that the judgment of the Court&nbsp; of First Instance was&nbsp; final&nbsp; and&nbsp; conclusive,&nbsp; said: 'The petition&nbsp; is&nbsp; denied, and the&nbsp; proceedings in&nbsp; the&nbsp; case shall be&nbsp; continued for the&nbsp; determination by judgment of the main issues therein.' "</p></blockquote><p>On the 17th of October, 1911, the defendant and appellant presented his printed bill of exceptions,&nbsp; a copy of which was sent to the plaintiffs and appellees on the same day.</p><p>On the 23d&nbsp; of October, 1911, the plaintiffs and appellees presented another motion, asking for the dismissal of the appeal, which was as follows:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"Now&nbsp; come the appellees&nbsp; in&nbsp; the above-entitled case and respectfully represent to the&nbsp; honorable&nbsp; Supreme Court: That the exception entered by the defendant against the judgment of the Court of First Instance, was made out of season, and the petitioners&nbsp; therefore pray that&nbsp; the appellant's bill of exceptions be declared to have been improperly admitted."</p></blockquote><p>By an&nbsp; examination of the&nbsp; second motion, it will be noted that the&nbsp; grounds upon which it is based necessarily existed at the&nbsp; time of the presentation of the first motion to dismiss said appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems to be a&nbsp; rule well established by courts generally, that a second motion to&nbsp; dismiss an appeal, based&nbsp; on the&nbsp; same grounds as the former&nbsp; motion, <em>or on grounds existing at the time of such former&nbsp; motion,</em> will, as a general rule, be denied.&nbsp; (Nashua &amp; L. R. Corp. <em>vs.</em> Boston &amp; L. R. Corp., 51 Fed. Rep., 929; Hellings <em>vs.</em> Duvall, 131 Cal., 618; Dorn <em>vs.</em> Baker, 92 Cal., 194; Tyrrell <em>vs.</em> Baldwin, 78 Cal., 470; Bingham <em>vs.</em> Brumback, 24 111. App., 332; Ferguson <em>vs.</em> Bruckman,&nbsp; 164 N. Y., 481; Pettit vs. Hamlyn, 42 Wis., 434.)</p><p>A second&nbsp; motion to dismiss an&nbsp; appeal upon&nbsp; grounds existing at the time the first motion was presented, should never be granted,&nbsp; unless at the time of the denying of the first motion, permission was obtained to present a second. Appellants should not be&nbsp; annoyed nor delayed by subsequent motions based upon&nbsp; grounds existing at the time of a previous motion, made for the same purpose.&nbsp; (King <em>vs.</em> Pony Gold Mining Co., 24&nbsp; Mont., 470.)</p><p>Moreover it&nbsp; will be noted that the&nbsp; second motion&nbsp; presented was a motion to dismiss the&nbsp; appeal for the reason that the exception to the judgment in the court below had not been made within the time&nbsp; prescribed by&nbsp; law.&nbsp;&nbsp; The appellant presented his bill of exceptions in&nbsp; the court below, after&nbsp; much&nbsp; delay, upon the 23d of&nbsp; June, 1911, for approval and certification.&nbsp; The&nbsp; plaintiffs and appellees were duly&nbsp; notified that&nbsp; said&nbsp; bill of exceptions had&nbsp; been presented to the court below for approval. They made no objection whatever to its&nbsp; approval&nbsp; and certification.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the 7th of July, 1911, the judge&nbsp; of the lower&nbsp; court duly approved and certified said bill of exceptions, without any exception whatever from the appellees.&nbsp; Where the parties in the lower court have received&nbsp; a copy of a bill of exceptions, with due notice of its presentation&nbsp; for approval to the lower&nbsp; court,&nbsp; and fail to present&nbsp; to the lower court objections against the approval of the same, the Supreme Court&nbsp; will be&nbsp; slow to&nbsp; dismiss the&nbsp; appeal upon&nbsp; grounds which&nbsp; existed at the time&nbsp; the bill of exceptions was&nbsp; presented in the lower court for approval, especially when the parties have waited until after the appellants have incurred the expense&nbsp; of printing&nbsp; their bill&nbsp; of exceptions in the Supreme Court.</p><p>For the foregoing reasons, the said motion of October 23, 1911, is hereby denied.</p><p><em> Arellano, C. J,, Torres, Mapa, Johnson,</em> and <em><em>Moreland, JJ., </em></em>concur.<br><em><em></em></em></p></div><em></em>
