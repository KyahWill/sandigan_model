				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> Appeal  by counsel for Florencio Pozadas, allowed in both effects, from the  order of the  24th of June,  1901, directing the  reversal of the order giving Pozadas possession of the land  referred  to in this proceeding which is declared to be contentious, preserving  to  the parties their respective  possession of land, with one-third part of the costs to the municipal  president of the town of San Carlos, the other two-thirds of the costs to  be paid by the plaintiff and the  defendant,  the said Pozadas being enjoined from molesting Domingo Martinez in his possession of the land in question.</p>
<p> By petition of the 13th of May, 1901, Florencio Pozadas, alleging that he was the owner of a parcel of land situated at a place called Pata, of the town of San Garlos, the extent and boundaries of which appear from the public instrument  by which the  land was  acquired, recorded in the Register of Property, and which he exhibited as evidence of his rights of ownership, asked that he be judicially put in possession  of  the said land in accordance  with the provisions of article 2015 of the Law of Civil Procedure then in force.   The petitioner prayed that the municipal president of San Carlos, acting as justice of the peace, be authorized to  execute the order, and that the petitioner be given a transcript of  the order directing that he be given possession of the lands, and also a transcript of the record  of its execution, and that  the public instrument exhibited by him be returned.</p>
<p> By order of the same date the court granted Pozadas's petition, without  prejudice to third persons with better right.   On the 22d of  May, after the publication of the edicts citing the owners of the adjacent lands; Pozadas was put in possession of the land referred to in the deed mentioned, without opposition on the part of any third person, and the area and boundaries of the land were recorded in the minutes of the proceeding.  But the judge, by an order of the 25th of May, after an examination of these minutes, and in  view of certain defects observed in the citation of the owners of the adjacent lands and the insufficient description of the boundaries, declared the act by which possession was given to be null and void, and  ordered  the municipal president of San Carlos to repeat the proceedings, after compliance with the formalities indicated.</p>
<p> The proceeding by which Pozadas was to be put in possession  of the land claimed having been had de novo, the area and boundaries  of which land  were recorded in  the minutes of the 31st of May, Domingo  Martinez and Magdalena  Martinez, husband and wife,  appeared and made opposition thereto.</p>
<p> These individuals filed a petition on the 29th of May with the municipal president, the commissioner, asking that by virtue  of the claims set forth therein, supported by documentary evidence, the possession which was about to be conferred <em>de novo</em> on Pozadas be suspended, if the land of which Magdalena Martinez was in possession as owner was included therein, and that report of this opposition be made to  the  Court of First Instance; but  the municipal president, without granting this petition, notified the claimant Martinez  to prosecute his claim before the Court of First Instance.  This he did by filing a petition, dated the 1st of June, asking that the possession last conferred upon Pozadas  be set  aside, and  that  the latter be ordered to assert his  rights in the corresponding civil action.</p>
<p> After an ocular inspection  by the  court, in pursuance with an order made by him  in furtherance of justice, and upon a  report by  the clerk of the court,  the order here appealed was entered, upon the ground that the possession given Pozadas by the last proceeding constituted an ouster from a  judicial possession  formerly conferred  by  final judgment  rendered in a contradictory suitâ€”a  stronger title than  a deed of sale, even if supported by a title  obtained by composition with the State, which might be  set aside in  a similar action; that such a title might serve as a basis for obtaining the possession of realty by voluntary jurisdiction proceedings,  provided this realty be  not possessed by a third party, but  that such proceedings should be suspended as  soon as opposition  is made by any third person, who can not be ousted without first having had his day in court; and that,  therefore, it was the duty of the president of San Carlos to have suspended the  proceedings by  which he was  conferring possession, in  view of the opposition of Martinez  and his  wife.</p>
<p> This is a question concerning a proceeding of voluntary jurisdiction instituted for the purpose of obtaining judicial intervention  in  order to  avoid damage whiclr might  be suffered  in a property  right, the petitioner to that end availing  himself  of the provisions of  article 2015 of the Law of Civil Procedure then in force.</p>
<p> The judge, in accordance  with the provisions of article 2016 of the same Law, ordered that the possession solicited be given  without prejudice to the rights of third persons.</p>
<p> It is true that on the 22d of May,  1901, Pozadas was placed  in possession of  the land  to which  the proceeding referred without opposition on the part of any third person, but it is also true that, by an order of the 25th of the same month, and for the reasons therein expressed, the proceeding by which possession was given was declared void, and directions were given that the proceeding be effected anew.</p>
<p> The order of the 25th of  May having become final and unappealable, as the appellant took no  exception thereto, we can not now discuss the question as to whether this order was correct or not; and therefore the new  proceedings for giving possession of the 31st of the same month would have been  perfectly legal had it not been for the opposition of Martinez  and his wife  before Pozadas was put in possession of the land.  This  opposition, made in due time,  was sufficient to have given the proceedings a contentious character.</p>
<p> It must be remembered that the judicial  order of possession can be executed only in case no opposition is made by a third person interested in  the matter.  This is the situation of Martinez and his wife, who allege that they are in possession  under a claim of ownership of a piece of land included in the estate which was and is the object of  Pozadas's  claim.   The moment that opposition was made to  the proceedings, as  was that of Martinez and his wife, before  possession  was given,  the  execution of the order of possession should have  been  suspended,  and the proceedings of voluntary jurisdiction  dismissed, with the result of converting  the action  into  one of contentious jurisdiction, in  accordance with  the provisions of article 1817 of the Law of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p> From these considerations it is evident that the order appealed is without error,  and,  although the possession given Pozadas by the municipal  president of San  Carlos on the 31st of May, 1901, was in violation of the provisions of the said article 1817,  nevertheless the fact that he was a layman and  that he acted in good faith, as shown by the text of the order of the 20th  of May, exempt him from responsibility or liability to any disciplinary correction, and for this reason  no special order should have been made concerning the costs in the first  instance.</p>
<p> Upon  these grounds, therefore, we are of opinion  that the order of the 24th of June, 1901, should be affirmed, with  the costs  of  the second instance to the appellant, but the said order  is understood as reversed with respect to the costs of the first  instance and is to be understood as standing without any special declaration as to the costs of that instance.   So ordered.</p>
<p> <em> Arellano, C. J., Cooper, Willard,</em> and <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p> <em>Mapa, J.,</em> did not sit in this case.<br>
