				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. ADAUCTO OCAMPO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Adaucto Ocampo, the appellant in this case, was sentenced by the
trial court to six years' imprisonment for the crime of robbery.<p></p>
<p>The testimony connecting him with the crime of which he was
convicted consisted of statements of three self confessed accomplices.
Counsel for the defense urged that this evidence was incompetent and
should not have been taken into consideration by the trial court.</p>
<p>While the evidence of accomplices or confederates is always subject
to grave suspicion, "coming, as it does, from a polluted source," and
should be received with great caution and closely and doubtingly
examined, we are of the opinion, nevertheless, that it is admissible
and competent, and may be taken into consideration under the provisions
of section 55 of General Orders, No. 58, series of 1900,</p>
<p>"The rule allowing the admission of accomplices or confederates in
the crime to testify is supported by public policy and necessity, since
it is scarcely possible to detect conspiracies and many worse offenses
without the information of those who are implicated in the crime." (Am.
and Eng. Ency. of Law, p. 397.)</p>
<p>The evidence adduced at the trial fully establishes the guilt of the
accused, and there was no error prejudicial to the rights of the
appellant and the sentence appealed from should be affirmed, with the
costs in both instances against the appellant. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C.J., Torres, Mapa, </em>and <em>Johnson, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
