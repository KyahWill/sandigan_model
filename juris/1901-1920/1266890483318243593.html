				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This defendant was charged&nbsp; with the crime of <em>estafa.</em> The complaint alleged:&nbsp; <blockquote><p>"That on or before&nbsp; August 1, 1911, in the city of Manila, Philippine Islands,&nbsp; the&nbsp; said accused was acting as agent for the West Coast Life Insurance Company of San Francisco, California, a corporation duly authorized to do business in the Philippine Islands, and&nbsp; as such agent of the West Coast Life Insurance Company of San Francisco, California, the said accused did on or before August&nbsp; 1, 1911, receive policy No. 7476, for Estanislao&nbsp; Labucay in&nbsp; the sum of&nbsp; P6,000, with an annual premium of P504,&nbsp; Philippine currency, with the obligation of delivering said policy to the said Estanislao&nbsp; Labucay upon payment by&nbsp; said Estanislao Labucay of&nbsp; the sum of P504 as&nbsp; premium, and of turning over to said West&nbsp; Coast Life&nbsp; Insurance Company of&nbsp; San Francisco, California,&nbsp; at its office in Manila, the said premium of P504,&nbsp; Philippine currency, and that the said accused did at&nbsp; said time and place&nbsp; deliver the policy and did&nbsp; then&nbsp; collect&nbsp; from&nbsp; said&nbsp; Estanislao&nbsp; Labucay&nbsp; the annual premium of&nbsp; P504, Philippine currency, but did at said time and place fail to deliver and make report to said West&nbsp; Coast Life Insurance Company&nbsp; of San&nbsp; Francisco, California, at its office in Manila, Philippine Islands, regarding said sum of P504,&nbsp; Philippine currency, but that he did willfully,&nbsp; fraudulently, unlawfully and criminally appropriate, misapply and&nbsp; divert to his&nbsp; own private use and benefit the said sum of P504, Philippine currency, to&nbsp; the&nbsp; damage and detriment of said&nbsp; West Coast Life Insurance Company&nbsp; of&nbsp; San Francisco, California, in the said sum of P504, Philippine currency, equivalent to 2,520 pesetas."</p></blockquote><p>After hearing the evidence, the Honorable A. S. Crossfield, judge, found that the evidence showed, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant was guilty of the crime of estafa of P327.60, and sentenced him to be imprisoned for a period of five months of <em>arresto mayor</em>, and to pay the costs.</p><p>From that sentence the defendant appealed&nbsp; and&nbsp; made the following assignments of error in this court:</p><p>First. That&nbsp; the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a public offense.</p><p>Second.&nbsp; That the court has no jurisdiction over the offense charged in the complaint.</p><p>Third. That the court's findings of fact are contrary to the weight of the evidence.</p><p>Fourth.&nbsp; That the conclusions and the decision of the court are not justified by the evidence or the&nbsp; court's&nbsp; findings of fact.</p><p>With reference&nbsp; to the first assignment of error, it may be said, that an examination of&nbsp; the record fails to disclose that the defendant made any objection whatever to the sufficiency of the complaint in the court below.&nbsp; In the absence of such objection,&nbsp; this&nbsp; court will not consider that question when presented for the first time here.&nbsp; When no objection is made to the sufficiency of the complaint in the lower court, the objection will&nbsp; not be considered on appeal.&nbsp; (U. S. <em>vs.</em> Mabanag, 1 Phil. Rep., 441; U. S.<em> vs.</em> Cajayon, 2 Phil.&nbsp; Rep., 570; U. S. <em>vs.</em>&nbsp; Mack, 4,Phil. Rep., 291;&nbsp; U. S. <em>vs</em>. Sarabia, 4 Phil. Rep., 566; Mortiga <em>vs</em>. Serra et al,, 5 Phil. Rep., 34; (See also 204 U. S., 470, and 11&nbsp; Phil. Rep., 762); U. S. <em>vs.</em> Paraiso, 5&nbsp; Phil. Rep., 149;&nbsp; (See also case&nbsp; of&nbsp; Paraiso, 207 U. S., 368); (See also&nbsp; 11 Phil. Rep., 799); U.&nbsp; S. <em>vs</em>. Aldos, 6 Phil,&nbsp; Rep.,&nbsp; 381; U.&nbsp; S. vs. Eusebio, 8 Phil. Rep.,&nbsp; 574; U. S. <em>vs.</em> Flores, 9 Phil. Rep., 47, 48;&nbsp; U. S. <em>vs</em>. Lampano, 13 Phil. Rep., 409.)</p><p>With&nbsp; reference to the second assignment of error, to wit, that.the court had no jurisdiction over the offense charged in the complaint,&nbsp; the appellant alleges that no part of the crime was committed in the city of Manila.&nbsp; It was argued by the appellant that the <em>estafa</em> charged in the complaint was committed in the city of Cebu, which is outside of the jurisdiction of the court.&nbsp; The appellant,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; overlooks the fact that the&nbsp; contract of the defendant with the offended party was executed at Manila,&nbsp; and provides that the defendant,&nbsp; under his&nbsp; obligation to the offended party, should render his accounts to the offended party in the city of Manila.&nbsp; It is true that the defendant collected the money which he misappropriated in the city of Cebu, but under his contract he was&nbsp; bound to account for such money to his principal (the offended party) in the city&nbsp; of Manila, and failing so to do, the crime of&nbsp; <em>estafa</em> was properly charged as having been committed&nbsp; in Manila, which place was within the jurisdiction of. the trial court.</p><p>In the case of the State&nbsp; of Ohio <em>vs</em>. Bailey (50 Ohio State Reports, 636), it appears from the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause, that&nbsp; a contract of employment was made in one county, by which the accused was authorized to canvass for and sell his employer's goods&nbsp; in another county, and to account therefor in the county where&nbsp; the contract was made, either by letter or in person.&nbsp; At the request of the defendant and under&nbsp; the&nbsp; terms of the contract, merchandise was sent to him by his employer, from the cpunty where the contract&nbsp; was&nbsp; made&nbsp; to the&nbsp; county where he (defendant) was actually&nbsp; operating, and&nbsp; where he received and sold such merchandise.&nbsp; After the defendant had sold the goods he wrote a false account of the&nbsp; transaction to his employer, addressed said letter to his employer in the county where the contract was made, which letter he mailed on the railroad&nbsp; train while&nbsp; absconding. The letter was received by&nbsp; the employer in the&nbsp; county&nbsp; where&nbsp; the contract&nbsp; was made.&nbsp; The supreme court of Ohio held that the defendant might be indicted&nbsp; and tried in the county&nbsp; where the contract was made.&nbsp;&nbsp; (See also <em>Ex Parte</em> Hedley, 31 Cal., 108; Brown <em> vs</em>. State, 23 Texas Appeals, 214&nbsp; (1887),&nbsp; 4 S. W. Reporter, 588.)</p><p>In the&nbsp; case before us the contract&nbsp; of&nbsp; employment was made in the city of Manila; it was the duty of the defendant to account there either by letter or in&nbsp; person.&nbsp;&nbsp; His failure to comply with his promise or obligation to the&nbsp; offended party therefore took place in the city of Manila, within the jurisdiction of the trial court.</p><p>The&nbsp; foregoing&nbsp; doctrine&nbsp; was&nbsp; recognized&nbsp; by&nbsp; this court, although the question was not specifically discussed, in the cases of U. S. <em>vs,</em>&nbsp; Ongtengco&nbsp; (4 Phil. Rep., 144), and U. S. <em>vs.</em> Jockers (7 Phil. Rep., 464).</p><p>Our conclusion is that the lower court has jurisdiction over the offense charged in the complaint.</p><p>With reference to the third&nbsp; and fourth assignments of error, it may be said that an examination of the&nbsp; evidence adduced during the trial of the cause, shows beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant committed the crime described in the complaint in the manner and form therein alleged, and without a more detailed discussion of the evidence&nbsp; adduced during the trial of the cause, we are of the opinion&nbsp; that the sentence of the lower court is&nbsp; fully sustained by&nbsp; the evidence and the law.</p><p>It will be noted that the sentence, of&nbsp; the lower court was that the defendant should be imprisoned for a period of five months of <em>arresto mayor</em> and to pay the costs of the action.&nbsp; The lower court evidently&nbsp; overlooked some of the requirements of&nbsp; law.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; defendant should&nbsp; have been required to&nbsp; return the amount of money appropriated to his own use (the sum of P327.60) or to indemnify the offended party in that amount, and he&nbsp; should&nbsp; also have been sentenced with the accessory penalty provided for in article 61 of the&nbsp; Penal Code.&nbsp; Therefore the sentence of the lower court is hereby modified and it is hereby&nbsp; ordered&nbsp; that the defendant be sentenced to be imprisoned for a period of five months of <em>arresto mayor</em>, to&nbsp; return to the offended party the sum of P327.60 or to1 indemnify him in that&nbsp; amount, with the accessory penalty&nbsp; provided for&nbsp; in&nbsp; article&nbsp; 61 of the Penal Code, and to pay the costs, and&nbsp; in&nbsp; case of insolvency&nbsp; to suffer subsidiary imprisonment&nbsp; for the&nbsp; amount of&nbsp; money appropriated to his own use.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.</p><p><em> Arellano,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J.,&nbsp; Torres, Mapa,&nbsp; Carson,</em>&nbsp; and <em>Trent,&nbsp; JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
