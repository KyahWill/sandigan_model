				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">REGISTRATION OF LAND; EVIDENCE OF OWNERSHIP; SIMPLE POSSESSION FOR THIRTY YEARS.—From the Court of Land Registration.&nbsp; Goldsborough, J.<br><br>The petitioner in the court below presented certain oral and documentary evidence which proved the company's ownership of the land described, unless the appellants had acquired title thereto by prescription. It was not prejudicial error to admit such evidence. Appellants presented no documentary evidence to show their ownership and their claims rest upon the extraordinary prescription of thirty years. In such case it is not sufficient to show mere possession but the possession must be that of an owner and this appellants failed to establish. Judgment for petitioner affirmed.<br><br>For appellants: Luciano de la Rosa.<br><br>For appellants: Ortigas &amp;; Fisher.</div>
