				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"> The plaintiff and appellant moved for a new trial in the court below on the ground of the insufficiency of the evidence, but he took no exception to the order denying such motion.&nbsp; We can not, therefore, review the evidence.<br><br>The court found as a fact that the allegations of the complaint were not proven.&nbsp; This is a sufficient finding to support a judgment acquitting the defendant&nbsp; of the complaint.&nbsp; No facts are stated in the decision&nbsp; which in any way indicate that the plaintiff is&nbsp; the owner of the land in question, or has any interest therein.<br><br>The answer contains a general&nbsp; denial and an admission that the&nbsp; defendant is in&nbsp; possession of a part&nbsp; of the land described in the&nbsp; complaint.&nbsp; There&nbsp; is nothing&nbsp; in&nbsp; the answer which&nbsp; in any way admits that the plaintiff is the owner of the land or has any interest therein.<br><br>The judgment of the court below is affirmed,&nbsp; with the costs of this instance against the appellant.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano, C&nbsp; J., Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson,</i> and <i>Tracey, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
