				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The facts as found by the trial court which connect the accused with  the commission of the crime charged may be summarized as follows: First, that  the  deceased came to his death by being stabbed in the back with a sharp-pointed instrument; second, enmity  and bad blood between the accused and the  deceased for a period of about three years prior to the commission of the  crime;  third, the finding of a blood-stained dagger three days after the commission of the crime some forty or fifty yards from the place w,here the body was  found,  and  the  identification by  several witnesses of this dagger with one known to have been in the possession of the accused some three or  four months prior to the commission of the crime; fourth,  the fact that the accused was seen at a point on the road about one mile from the scene of the crime at about 9 o'clock of the night when it took place, and that he was wearing  in his belt a dagger that resembled the one found near the body of the deceased; fifth, the  fact that the people  in the community did not  usually  carry daggers, a prohibitory ordinance having been enacted by the municipal authorities.</p>
<p>We think, however, that the evidence of record as to the identity  of the dagger found near the scene  of the crime with the dagger said to  have been seen in the possession of the accused some months prior thereto is unsatisfactory and that the evidence is wholly  insufficient  to sustain a finding  beyond a reasonable doubt that the  accused was seen on the night of the crime wearing such a dagger.</p>
<p>When independent facts  and circumstances are relied upon to identify the accused as the person who committed the crime charged,  each  material independent fact or circumstance necessary to  complete the chain  or series of independent facts tending  to establish  a presumption of guilt should be established to the same degree of certainty as the main fact.  (People vs. Ah Chung, 54 Cal., 398; State vs. Messemer, 75 N.  C, 385; Harrison vs.  State, 6 Tex. App., 42; IT. S. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Vanranst, Fed. Oases, 16608.)</p>
<p>Several witnesses testified that the dagger found near the scene of the crime resembled a dagger which they had previously seen  in  the possession  of the accused, in size,. shape, and color, and that both were ornamented with a copper coin set  in  at the tip of the handle,  but some of these witnesses declared  that the dagger they had seen in the possession  of the  accused  had two edges, while the evidence shows that the dagger found after the crime had but one, and this conflict  would  seem  sufficient to raise some doubt as to the identity of the daggers,  one with the other, especially as the dagger found after the crime was committed was not produced in evidence.   The evidence that the accused was seen wearing a similar dagger shortly before the commission of the crime rests on the testimony of a  single witness, who alleges that at  9 o'clock of the night when the crime was committed he  saw the accused pass on  the street with a dagger in its sheath strapped at his side.  The witness describes the weapon as being about the same size as the dagger found near  the place where the crime was committed and dark in color, but was unable to give any further details in regard to it.   In view of the advanced hour of the night, the place, the relative positions of the witness and the accused, and in view, further, of the unsatisfactory character of his testimony upon cross-examination, we are disposed to doubt whether he ever saw the weapon which he attempted to describe.  It would take much better testimony than that of this witness to convince us that the accused went to the place of ambush with  the dagger strapped to his waist in full view of every passer-by.</p>
<p>But even though we could accept all the findings of  the trial court, we think that they are not sufficient to establish the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>Before a conviction can be had upon circumstantial evidence, the circumstances proven should constitute an unbroken chain which leads to but one fair and reasonable conclusion, which points  to the defendant  to the exclusion of all others as  the guilty person.   [Commonwealth  vs. Kirkpatrick,  15 Leg. Int., 208 (Pa.), 1858.] The failure to find the dagger for some days after the crime, although it appears that a number of people visited the place where the body was found  on  the following day, suggests the possibility that it might  have been  placed there by some enemy of the accused or  by the real murderer  to divert suspicion from himself; and this hypothesis, which is consistent with the innocence of the accused, is not inconsistent with any of the remaining facts found by the trial court and adduced in evidence, nor is it inherently  improbable or contrary to common experience in such cases.</p>
<p>The connection of the accused with the crime with which he is charged is not sustained by the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, and he should be and is hereby acquitted, with the costs of both instances <em>de oficio</em>, and he will be set at liberty forthwith.</p>
<p>After the expiration of ten days from the date of final judgment  let the case be remanded to the court below for proper action.   So ordered. </p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Willard,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em>Johnson, J.,</em> did not sit in this case.<br>
