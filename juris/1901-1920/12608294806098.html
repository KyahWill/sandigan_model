				<H3>TY LACO CIOCO, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. ARISTON MURO ET AD., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.

				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This  is  an appeal from a judgment  of the Court of First Instance of Samar,  in an action to recover the  sum of P1,370, which came into the possession of the defendants  by virtue of a judgment rendered in favor of Justo Mendoza,  one of the said defendants, and against Ty Laco Cioco, the plaintiff in this action,  for  rent of a certain house in  Guiuan, Samar,  and damages  for the Unlawful detention thereof.  The latter judgment was rendered in the court of the justice of the peace of Guiuan, but was set aside by  the Court of First Instance of Samar  in certiorari proceedings.</p>
<p>The defendants in this action admitted that they received the sum of P1,370, as alleged in the complaint; one of them, the said  Justo  Mendoza, by  way  of counterclaim, alleged that the plaintiff  was lawfully  indebted to him in the sum of P989.99, damages for the unlawful detention of the house in question during its  occupancy by the plaintiff.</p>
<p>There was no dispute as to the occupancy of the house in question by  the plaintiff  for  the period of two years and twenty-three days, nor  as to the just rental value thereof; nor is  it alleged that payment  of rent had been made to the defendant, Mendoza, except the payment made by virtue  of the said judgment in the court of the justice of the peace, which was set aside in certiorari proceedings.</p>
<p>The principal question  at  the trial was the right of ownership of  the defendant,  Mendoza, in the said house, and his right arising therefrom to damages for its occupation by the plaintiff.  The trial court was of opinion that the evidence  of record established  Mendoza's right of ownership, and sustained  his counterclaim for damages, which were fixed at an amount equal to  the rental value of the property  during its occupation  by  the plaintiff, together with  interest thereon at the legal rate until paid. Judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of P319.34, that  being the difference between the amount received by the defendants by virtue of the judgment  of the justice of  the peace which  was set aside in certiorari  proceedings and  the amount of the rental value during the term of the occupancy  of the house  by the plaintiff, with interest.</p>
<p>We think the  evidence of record fully sustains the finding of the trial  court, that the defendant, Mendoza, was the owner of the house in question and entitled to recover from the plaintiff an  amount equal  to the rental value thereof during1 the term of its occupancy by him.  No question having been  raised by the appellant as to the action of the court in allowing  interest  upon the  rent, and in imposing the costs upon the plaintiff, we have not found it necessary to review its action in these matters.</p>
<p>Counsel for  the  appellant  contends that the right of the defendant, Mendoza, to recover the rental value of the property, and his  right to the possession  during the term of its occupancy by the plaintiff is <em>res  judicata</em>, because, in a certain action in the court of the justice of the peace of the town of Guiuan, brought by  Mendoza against the plaintiff in  this action, Ty Laco Cioco, for the recovery of the possession of the house in question and damages for its occupation and use, judgment was rendered in favor of Ty Laco Cioco and against Mendoza, which judgment became final,  no appeal having been  taken therefrom.  It  appears that this  judgment was rendered prior to the above-mentioned judgment in the  same court in favor of Mendoza and against Ty Laco Cioco, which was set aside in certiorari proceedings.</p>
<p>We think that the contention of <em>res judicata</em> relied upon by the appellant is completely disposed of by the provisions of section 87 of the Code of  Civil  Procedure, which is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"A judgment rendered in a suit of unlawful entry and detainer, either for the plaintiff  or defendant, shall not bar an action in the Court of First Instance between the same parties respecting title to the land or building; nor shall any judgment given therein be held conclusive of the facts found in another action between the same parties."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason for these provisions becomes obvious when we consider the nature of the summary remedies of forcible entry and wrongful detainer, and the limitations imposed by  law  upon  the  evidence  which may  be submitted in such actions.</p>
<p>The question to be determined in these summary actions is not whether the plaintiff is entitled to possession upon submission of proof of  ownership and the lawful right to possession of the property.  The true question submitted is, whether he is entitled <em>to be restored</em> to the bare physical <em>natural</em> possession which  he had at the time when it  is alleged the defendant deprived him thereof; and section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that judgment for <em>restitution</em> shall be rendered in favor of the  plaintiff in these summary actions  (without regard to the  question whether he is or is not lawfully entitled to the possession of the property in question as owner, or otherwise) where it appears that, having been  in  possession, lawfully or otherwise, he has been deprived thereof by force, intimidation, fraud, strategy, or stealth,  or  where it appears that a tenant, vendor, vendee, or other person unlawfully with-holds  possession from  him  after the expiration  of such person's right  thereto <em>by virtue of a contract, cwpress or implied.</em></p>
<p>In determining the questions to which summary actions for forcible  entry or unlawful detainer are limited, the right  of  ownership  and the right  of  possession  arising from the right of ownership can have  no bearing, as the plaintiff is entitled to "restitution of possession" if he can show that he has been  deprived of the bare physical possession by any  of the methods set out in that sectionâ€”and this  even though  it should  afterwards develop that the defendant was the owner of the property, and  as such clearly entitled  to  possession as  against the plaintiff. Hence, evidence of ownership,  and of the right of possession  of the property in question, is  not admissible at the trial of these summary actions (Evangelista <em>vs</em>.  Tabayuyong, 7 Phil.  Rep., 607; Alonso <em>vs</em>. Municipality of Placer, 5 Phil. Rep., 71; 8 Mont., 305) ; and it would be a manifest injustice  that  a  judgment in such a  summary  action, wherein this  proof is not admissible, should be held to be conclusive of the  facts found  in another action  between the same parties, where such evidence may  be introduced, or be a bar to the recovery of damages when it is made to appear in another action that the possession to Avhich the party was restored, or in which he was confirmed, in the summary action, was, in fact, an unlawful  possession.</p>
<p>The judgment of  the trial  court is affirmed, with  the costs of this instance  against  the appellant.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C.  J., Torres, Johnson, Willard,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
