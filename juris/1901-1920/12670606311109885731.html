				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This case was brought up on appeal filed by counsel for the accused from the 
judgment dated September 15, 1913, whereby the Honorable Francisco Santamaria, 
judge, found him guilty of the crime of homicide and sentenced him to the 
penalty of twelve years and one day of reclusion temporal, to the accessories of 
article 59 of the Code, to pay an indemnity of P1,000 to the family of the 
deceased, and to the costs. 
<p>It appears to have been duly proven in said case that in the early morning of 
Monday, May 19,1913, Candido Aquino attacked Ceferino Cristal, because the 
latter had tried to take away a carabao of his or of Braulio Cacatian, as is 
recorded on page 33. Cristal was near the inclosed lot where Candido Aquino had 
his carabao quarantined, in the territory of the pueblo of Narvacan, Ilocos Sur. 
Aquino inflicted upon him four wounds, the first a stab in the right shoulder 
near the spinal column, which penetrated his chest; the second in the upper 
right portion of his breast, which also penetrated his chest; the third in the 
lower part of the same region near the diaphragm and the fourth in the middle of 
his neck near the larynx. As a result of these wounds the victim fell face 
downwards on the ground and must have died a few moments afterwards.</p>
<p>At the time of the occurrence, Braulio Cacatian was leaving his house in 
search of fodder for his carabao and, upon going by the place, saw the corpse 
with spots of blood on its back; he also saw his uncle, Candido Aquino, near the 
place where the corpse was. Cacatian asked him who had killed the man stretched 
out on the ground and the person addressed answered that he himself had killed 
him, whereupon Cacatian, amazed and terrified, went back into his house to get 
away from the accused, without asking any further questions about the affair. 
Candido Aquino there-upon returned to his house with his shirt stained with 
blood, and there told his son, Nemesio Aquino, 19 years old, that he had killed 
Ceferino Cristal, but did not state his reason.</p>
<p>A little while later in the same morning Candido Aquino went to the garden of 
Mariano Liberato, the lieutenant of the barrio, approached the place where 
Liberato was working, and voluntarily stated to him that he had killed the 
unfortunate Ceferino Cristal. But the lieutenant of the barrio, doubting the 
truth of the occurrence, went to the place where the corpse wad said to be and 
there actually saw it stretched out on the ground. He did not inquire into the 
motive or make any investigation, because of his fear, but conducted the accused 
to the house of the councilman of the barrio. There the accused was placed under 
arrest and taken to the justice of the peace, Rufino Viloria, before whom, upon 
examination, he pleaded guilty, affirming that he had killed Ceferino Cristal 
with a knife because the latter had attempted to take away a carabao of his.</p>
<p>The facts set forth constitute the crime of homicide, penalized under article 
404 of the Penal Code, for Ceferino Cristal was violently done to death by means 
of a deadly weapon; but it has not been ascertained whether any qualifying 
circumstance concurred in the commission of the crime, which must therefore be 
classified merely as simple homicide.</p>
<p>At the trial of the case the accused did not plead guilty, nor did he on his 
part reveal the motive that induced him to kill the deceased; but his counsel 
alleged that the court erred in finding him guilty and in imposing upon him the 
penalty for the crime of homicide, and in not dismissing the case and acquitting 
the accused, saying, moreover, that evidence of the guilt of the accused was 
lacking, and that the circumstantial evidence was not sufficient for his 
conviction.</p>
<p>In spite of these allegations the case furnishes circumstantial evidence 
which produces in the mind, beyond all doubt, complete proof of the guilt of the 
accused as the sole proven author by direct participation of the violent death 
of Ceferino Gristal. The fact that the accused Aquino was seen with his shirt 
stained with blood near the place where the corpse was stretched out; the free 
and voluntary statement that he made to Braulio Cacatian that he had killed the 
deceased, Ceferino Cristal; also the statement that he afterwards made in his 
house to his own son, Nemesio Aquino, who saw his father's shirt covered with 
blood, that he had killed the deceased; the third statement, also voluntary, 
that he made a few hours afterwards to Mariano Liberate, the lieutenant of the 
barrio, who, doubting the truth of the occurrence, went to the place where the 
corpse lay, guided by the accused himself; and the confession that he afterwards 
made to the justice of the peace who conducted the preliminary examination, and 
to whom he stated that the motive which led him to kill the deceased was that 
the latter had attempted to take away his carabaoâ€”the declarations of these four 
witnesses, one of them the son of the accused himself, constitute conclusive and 
decisive proof of his guilt as the undoubted author of the violent death of the 
said Ceferino Cristal.</p>
<p>The courts must apply the penalties set forth in the code when the guilt of 
the accused is proven by any of the duly accepted means, according to the rules 
of sound judgment. Among these, grave and convincing circumstantial evidence may 
serve as ground for the conviction, when it is derived from facts duly proven, 
when there exists more than one circumstance, and when the combination and 
connection of the circumstances leave no reasonable doubt of the guilt of the 
accused, in the ordinary and natural course of hu man affairs.</p>
<p>This case offers more than two circumstances, and the merits and facts which 
it brings out demonstrate the guilt of the accused in a positive manner. No 
aggravating circumstance is to be considered as concurring in the commission of 
the crime, but the special circumstance established in article 11 of the Code in 
connection with Act No, 2142 must be applied.</p>
<p>For the foregoing reasons, whereby the errors assigned to the judgment 
appealed from are deemed to have been refuted, it is proper to affirm the same, 
as we hereby do, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Johnson, Carson, Moreland,</em> and <em>Araullo, 
JJ.,</em> concur.<br></p></div>
