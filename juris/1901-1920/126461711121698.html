				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE,  VS. JOSE TENGCO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.

				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On the morning of August 7, 1902, the municipal policemen Antonio Mariano, Guillermo Cabrera, Agapito Lara, and Jose Tengco were returning to Arayat from the town of Conception, Tarlac.  They had with them Toribio  Macapinlac, whom they had arrested in  Concepcion on the charge of stealing a carabao belonging to Vicente Mangune. In crossing the estero at  Talabangca the policeman Jose Tengco struck Macapinlac, who was at that time tied elbow to elbow, two blows with the butt of his gun for having refused to  confess  that he was guilty of the  theft.   The blows were received on the abdomen and on the back,  and as a result thereof, in less than half an hour, Toribio  Macapinlac fell to the ground, and shortly after died in  consequence of internal hemorrhages and the rupture of the spleen, as appeared in the  examination held by a physician who watt a member of the board of health of Arayat,</p>
<p>The facts stated constitute the crime of murder, defined and punished  in article 403 of the Penal Code.  The deceased was struck with the  butt  of a gun, and, in consequence of the blow so received, he  died in less than half an hour, owing to injuries received by the spleen or some other vital organ. At the time the blow was struck the deceased was unable to defend himself or ward off  the attack, and, although he was not tied  for the purpose of killing him, but because he was being  conveyed as a prisoner charged witli theft, it  is unquestionable that his  aggressor acted with safety to himself, employing means which were conducive to the accomplishment of his purpose without  any risk arising from an attempt at self-defense.  Therefore the attack must be regarded as a treacherous one (<em>alevosia</em>), which circumstance converts the  violent death of the deceased into murder and demands a heavier penalty.</p>
<p>The defendant, Jose Tengco, pleaded not guilty and  testified as  a  witness in his own behalf.  He stated that he had struck the deceased,  Toribio  Macapinlac, two blows with the butt  of the gun  he was  carrying because Macapinlac had  lied, although he alleged that he had struck the deceased by order of Corpl. Antonio Mariano.</p>
<p>This allegation, denied by the corporal, and which was. apparently made by the defense in the  belief that it exempted the defendant from  responsibility, has not been proven in the trial.  Even if  it had been; in order that the person who actually performs the act may be exempt from criminal liability it is indispensable that the order be lawful, and the act done or ordered to be done must also be lawful.  Under these conditions obedience is due.  Without these conditions—that, is, when the order is unlawful or the act ordered to be done is unlawful—no obedience is due, for over and above the superior who orders the execution of such an unlawful act is the law itself, which prohibits  the commission of any act contrary to its precepts.  Therefore before the penal law the accused can not be regarded as exempt from liability.</p>
<p>Apart from  his explicit confession, the record  contains sufficient oral  evidence to fully convince the mind of  the guilt  of the defendant, who attacked the deceased in  the presence of witnesses whose testimony supports the charge.</p>
<p>In the commission of the crime  we must consider and apply mitigating circumstance No. 3 of article 9, and also the mitigating circumstance of article 11 of the Penal Code, inasmuch as the accused, owing to his nativity and ignorance, erroneously believed that he had a right to punish the deceased for lying.  In so doing it is unquestionable that he had no intention of killing him,  but simply of punishing him  by beating him with a gun—an unlawful act  The aggravating circumstance No. 11 of article 10 of the Penal Code can not be applied, as it was not necessary for the  accused, Tengco, to  have availed himself of  his capacity as a member of the  municipal police in order to ill treat the deceased, Toribio Macapinlac.</p>
<p>Upon  these  considerations, and  finding the existence in a  marked degree of the two mitigating circumstances referred to, without the concurrence of  any aggravating circumstance, we must apply the provisions of article  81, paragraph 5, of the Penal Code, imposing upon the defendant the penalty immediately inferior to that corresponding to the crime of murder, as designated in article 403, in  its inedium grade, to  wit, the penalty of <em>presidio mayor</em> in its maximum degree to cadena temporal  in its minimum and medium degrees.</p>
<p>With  respect to the motion for  a new  trial, made and overruled in the court below and  again brought forward in the appellate court, we regard it as unsustainable, as it does not fall within section 42 of  General Orders, No. 58, it not having been alleged that it was impossible to introduce the evidence1 now offered on account of some sufficient reason, or that a favorable result  of the  evidence would be of notorious influence upon the  defense of the accused. Furthermore, the motion is not supported  by the affidavits of the witnesses by whose testimony it is  proposed to introduce new evidence of the defendant's innocence.</p>
<p>We consider, therefore, that the decision of the court below overruling the said motion for a new trial was correct, upon the grounds therein stated.  As  we have already said, even if it were proven that the accused ill treated the deceased by order of a third person,  it can not be considered that, he acted in accordance with the obedience due to  a superior, because the act was unlawful; nor could the accused allege that he had acted in the performance of  a duty  or in the. lawful exercise of a right,  inasmuch as he had no right to beat Toribio Macapinlac with the butt of his gun without reason, and upon a futile pretext, to such an extent as to deprive him of life.</p>
<p>For the reasons  stated we are of the opinion that the judgment appealed must be reversed and the accused, Jose Tengco,  condemned to the penalty of fourteen years of <em>cadena temporal</em>, the medium period of the penalty immediately inferior to that prescribed by article 403, together with the accessory penalties of civil  interdiction during the period of the penalty and absolute,  perpetual disqualification,  and subjection to  the vigilance of  the  authorities through his life, and to the payment  of 1,000 Mexican pesos to the heirs of the deceased, Toribio Macapinlac, and to the payment of the costs of both instances.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Cooper,  Willard,  Mapa,</em>  and <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em>McDonough, J.,</em> did not sit in this  case.<br>
