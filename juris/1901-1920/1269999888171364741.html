				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This court, in the <em>per curiam</em>&nbsp; opinion filed September 1, 1911,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> said:&nbsp; <blockquote><p>"Without prejudice to the filing of a more extended opinion hereafter discussing more fully the facts and the law of the case, the judgment appealed from&nbsp; is hereby&nbsp; reversed m so far as it sustains the opposition&nbsp; of respondents, the opposition&nbsp; to the registration of the&nbsp; property described in the complaint is overruled, and the land described in the petition is ordered registered as therein prayed.&nbsp; No finding as to costs."</p></blockquote><p>The respondents Guillermo Crisostomo and Isabel Angelo having been&nbsp; notified of this&nbsp; judgment filed a petition on the 19th of September, 1911, asking the court to suspend the time in which the judgment ordered entered should become final until the court&nbsp; filed its extended&nbsp; opinion.&nbsp; It&nbsp; now becomes necessary to enter&nbsp; into&nbsp; an&nbsp; examination of&nbsp; the testimony and the law governing this case.</p><p>Marcela Gonzalez filed a petition in&nbsp; the Court of Land Registration asking that she be inscribed as the owner of the three parcels of land described in her petition.&nbsp; The Insular Government, being represented by the&nbsp; Attorney-General, appeared&nbsp; and opposed&nbsp; this registration&nbsp; on the ground that the lands&nbsp; formed a part of the public domain. Guillermo Crisostomo and Isabel Angeles also appeared and opposed&nbsp; the petition on&nbsp; the&nbsp; ground that they&nbsp; were the owners of certain portions of the land sought to be inscribed. Judgment was rendered in the court below supporting the opposition of Crisostomo and Angeles as to the portions of the lands described in their&nbsp; respective oppositions.&nbsp; The opposition of the Government was overruled and judgment was entered in favor of the petitioner&nbsp; as to all of the land except that as&nbsp; to&nbsp; which the&nbsp; said&nbsp; two oppositions&nbsp; were sustained.&nbsp; From the decree of the&nbsp; court sustaining these two oppositions&nbsp; the petitioner alone appealed.&nbsp; The only questions to be resolved relate to this appeal.</p><p>The important part of the judgment appealed&nbsp; from is the following:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"Therefore, the possession given to&nbsp; Revilla of the lands situated&nbsp; in Umanat and Tumana, respectively, was wholly unauthorized and illegal.&nbsp; Hence, he has not enjoyed the same&nbsp; continuously and peacefully, at least with reference to the lands in Umanat, in regard to which he was compelled to institute an action for the recovery of the same against one Guillermo Crisostomo.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even assuming that such possession was continuous and peaceful since the year 1887, when&nbsp; the land was&nbsp; awarded to him,&nbsp; his claim could not be established under any provision&nbsp; of&nbsp; law.&nbsp; The title which was subsequently issued in December,&nbsp; 1889, for the above mentioned lands was completely invalid.&nbsp; The grant to him being gratuitous, as it were, must&nbsp; have been necessarily made upon one&nbsp; of these two grounds, to wit:&nbsp; an&nbsp; uninterrupted possession for ten years with&nbsp; just title in good faith (sec. 4, regulations of June 25, 1880) ; or, if such a title was lacking,&nbsp; possession&nbsp; for a period of twenty years provided the lands were under cultivation, and of thirty years if. the lands&nbsp; were uncultivated.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Sec. 5 of the same regulations.) Neither&nbsp; of these two conditions&nbsp; obtained at the time the title, through an error or flaw, was&nbsp; granted,&nbsp; and secondly, because,&nbsp; considering the date on which the title was issued and the&nbsp; date&nbsp; upon which the grantee took&nbsp; possession, it could&nbsp; not have had&nbsp; effect with regard&nbsp; to Eulogio Revilla. The lands situated&nbsp; in&nbsp; Umanat were held and occupied&nbsp; by Crisostomo&nbsp; and&nbsp; Angeles,&nbsp; according to the&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; of record."</p></blockquote><p>The three parcels&nbsp; of land sought&nbsp; to&nbsp; be inscribed are, according to the petition,&nbsp; situated in&nbsp; Calumpang, Umanat, and Tumana, barrio of San Marcos, municipality of Calumpit, Province of Bulacan, and are respectively described as follows:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"<em>Parcel A</em>. - Bounded on the north&nbsp; by the lands of Pantaleon de los Santos, Pedro Flores, Honorata Bayan, Juan de los Reyes, and Eugenio Sufiga; on the east by the lands of Leon&nbsp; Rueda; on&nbsp; the west by the lands of Guillermo Crisostomo;&nbsp; and on&nbsp; the south by the lands of Generoso Tiongson; containing 221,115 square meters (22&nbsp; hectares 11 ares 15 centares).&nbsp; </p><p><em>"Parcel B. </em>- .Bounded on the north by the lands of Donato Bayan, Faustina Torres, Antonio de Leon, Benito Espiritu, Pablo Bundoc, Felipe&nbsp; de&nbsp; Leon,&nbsp; Felipe Balares, and Luis Sinkak; on the east by the lands of Guillermo Crisostomo; on the south by the lands&nbsp; of the Insular Government; and on the west&nbsp; by the lands of Guillermo Crisostomo,&nbsp; Felix Bautista, Sabino Manio, Pedro&nbsp; Flores, and Fruto Rojas: containing&nbsp; 194,747 square meters&nbsp; (19 hectares&nbsp; 47 ares&nbsp; 47 centares).&nbsp; </p><p>"<em>Parcel C</em>. - Bounded on the north by the Quingua River; on the east by&nbsp; the lands&nbsp; of Antonio de Leon and Luis Sinkak; on the south&nbsp; by the lands of Luis Sinkak, Tomas Lacsamana and Donato Bayan; and on the west by the lands of Antonio Tiongson; containing 52,852 square meters&nbsp; (5 hectares 28 ares 52 centares)."</p></blockquote><p>Guillermo Crisostomo opposed&nbsp; the registration of parcels A and B&nbsp; on the ground that there was included in parcel A 2&nbsp; hectares&nbsp; 66 ares and 40 centares, and in parcel B 8 hectares&nbsp; 55 ares and 5 centares, of his lands.&nbsp;&nbsp; Isabel Angeles opposed&nbsp; the registration of the same two&nbsp; parcels on the ground that there was included in parcel A 4 hectares 87 ares and 59&nbsp; centares of her&nbsp; property, and&nbsp; that all&nbsp; of parcel B except that part claimed by Guillermo Cris6stomo was her land.</p><p>The petitioner's title to these lands is based upon a purchase made by her&nbsp; from Eumelia&nbsp; Eleizegui and Salud Revilla, as appears from a public document duly executed on the 2d&nbsp; of November, 1907, and&nbsp; inscribed in the registry of property, Eumelia Eleizegui acting for&nbsp; herself and as guardian of the minors Eulogio, Manuel, Pilar,&nbsp; and Jose, surnamed&nbsp; Revilla.&nbsp;&nbsp; These&nbsp; vendors are&nbsp; the widow&nbsp; and children of&nbsp; the deceased Eulogio Revilla,&nbsp; husband of Eleizegui and father of the other vendors.</p><p>Sometime prior to the year 1880, Jose Perez Rubio filed in the Court of First Instance, Quiapo, Manila, a civil suit against&nbsp; Gregorio Rivera and&nbsp; Maria Soledad Cruz for the purpose of recovering certain fees for professional services. Subsequently thereto judgment was entered and&nbsp; execution issued against the defendants.&nbsp; By&nbsp; virtue of this execution the lands of the defendants situated&nbsp; in Calumpit were levied upon, and&nbsp; on the 23d&nbsp; of&nbsp; February,&nbsp; 1880,&nbsp; sold&nbsp; at&nbsp; public auction.&nbsp; On the 13th&nbsp; of November&nbsp; of&nbsp; that&nbsp; same&nbsp; year, Rubio by means of a public document executed by the clerk of the court, sold all his right, title, and interest&nbsp; in and to such lands to&nbsp; Eulogio Revilla for the&nbsp; sum of 2,000&nbsp; pesos. This sale was approved&nbsp; by&nbsp; the court.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the 12th of February, 1887, the purchaser,&nbsp; Revilla, was placed in possession of one parcel of land.&nbsp;&nbsp; Revilla,&nbsp; believing that&nbsp; he had not been placed&nbsp; in possession of all the lands purchased by him from Rubio, made application to the court to be&nbsp; placed in possession&nbsp; of&nbsp; two other parcels which he claimed&nbsp; were included in&nbsp; the execution sale and&nbsp; the purchase made by him.&nbsp; The&nbsp; appellant now insists that&nbsp; Revilla was, on the 18th&nbsp; of March,&nbsp; 1887,&nbsp; placed&nbsp; in possession&nbsp; of these&nbsp; two parcels by order of the court, and that the document of this purchase and sale, including the three&nbsp; parcels of land, was duly executed&nbsp; by&nbsp; order&nbsp; of&nbsp; the court on the 12th of&nbsp; April, 1889.</p><p>The appellees insist that the possession of the two parcels of land, one in Umanat&nbsp; and the other in Tumana, given to Revilla by the Court of First Instance of Quiapo was&nbsp; illegal and void, for the reason that the said lands in Umanat and Tumana were not included in the execution sale of February 23, 1880, as&nbsp; shown by the&nbsp; description of the lands then levied upon; and that the lands in the order of execution issued by the Court of First Instance of Quiapo are described as follows:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"Certain lands which they (the judgment debtors) possess in the jurisdiction of Calumpit, bounded on the north by the lands of Lorenzo de los Reyes; on the south by the lands of the town of Barosuain; on the east by the lands of Jose Tiongson; and on the west by the lands of Guillermo Crisostomo; containing three quinones, more or less."</p></blockquote><p>The appellees further insist that the lands described in their respective&nbsp; oppositions have been adjudged to be their property by a court of competent jurisdiction, and that the said judgments have long since become final.</p><p>Eulogio Revilla obtained on the 4th of December, 1889, a State grant for the three parcels of land described in the petition.&nbsp; The ownership&nbsp; of this land was adjudged to him on that date by&nbsp; the State and the title ordered registered. The registrar, on the 12th of September, 1892, made the following entry&nbsp; in the property&nbsp; register:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"The foregoing instrument was provisionally recorded in the absence of the old indices, at pages 241, 244, and 246, volume 1, of&nbsp; the Calumpit District,&nbsp; Properties Nos.&nbsp; 105, 106,107, entry letter A, Bulacan, September 12,1892."</p></blockquote><p>The final registration was made November 2, 1908.</p><p>The opponents lay no&nbsp; claim&nbsp; to that parcel&nbsp; of land described in paragraph C of&nbsp; the petition, neither do they claim to be the owners&nbsp; of all of parcel A, as it will be seen that this parcel contains&nbsp; 22 hectares&nbsp; 11&nbsp; ares&nbsp; and 15 centares, according to the petition, whereas the appellees together claim only 7 hectares&nbsp; 53&nbsp; ares and&nbsp; 99&nbsp; centares.&nbsp; This leaves undisputed 14 hectares 57 ares and 16 centares of that parcel. It is insisted that a portion of parcel A was the only&nbsp; land included in&nbsp; the&nbsp; order of&nbsp; execution issued in 1880.&nbsp; This contention is based upon the description of the land given in that order and its actual area, which appears to be three quinones, more or less.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the fact that it is stated that this parcel contains three quinones,&nbsp; more or less,&nbsp; it appears from the&nbsp; boundaries given that all of the land&nbsp; in that parcel was&nbsp; included.&nbsp; The&nbsp; statement "containing three quinones, more or less" is a mere estimate and it was&nbsp; not intended to be accurate.&nbsp; While it is true that parcel A was the only description in the order of execution, it is&nbsp; nevertheless&nbsp; a fact that all&nbsp; of the lands&nbsp; owned by the judgment debtors&nbsp; in that case were&nbsp; levied upon&nbsp; and the sale went forward on this theory.&nbsp; The judgment&nbsp; creditor purchased all of the lands owned by his judgment debtors within the jurisdiction&nbsp; of that&nbsp; barrio at this execution sale, and he&nbsp; transferred to Revilla all of the&nbsp; lands&nbsp; thus&nbsp; purchased;&nbsp; but when the authorities proceeded to put Revilla in possession of the lands purchased by him and placed him in possession of the one parcel only, he immediately made application to the&nbsp; court for the possession of the other two parcels,&nbsp; and upon this application&nbsp; he was given&nbsp; judicial possession&nbsp; of the said two parcels, one in Umanat&nbsp; and the other in Tumana.&nbsp;&nbsp; This fact was&nbsp; found by the trial&nbsp; court.</p><p>The appellee Crisostomo presented Exhibit&nbsp; No. 1, which is a copy of a judgment rendered in&nbsp; the case wherein&nbsp; he was plaintiff and&nbsp; Antero Coronel and Maria&nbsp; Soledad Cruz were&nbsp; defendants.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; this case&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; sought&nbsp; to recover possession of two parcels&nbsp; of iand.&nbsp;&nbsp; This action was commenced in&nbsp; 1878, judgment was rendered in favor&nbsp; of the plaintiff in 1892, and this judgment was executed in the same&nbsp; year over the opposition of Revilla.&nbsp; The&nbsp; execution of this judgment&nbsp; which resulted&nbsp; in&nbsp; temporarily&nbsp; placing Crisostomo in possession of these two parcels took place long after the State grant had been issued to Revilla and long after Revilla&nbsp; had been judicially placed in possession of these lands.&nbsp;&nbsp; Revilla was not a party plaintiff or&nbsp; defendant in that case,&nbsp; nor in any&nbsp; other case upon&nbsp; which the appellees rely.&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently,&nbsp; the judgments rendered&nbsp; in those&nbsp; cases could not be binding upon Revilla.</p><p>With reference to who was actually in possession of these two&nbsp; parcels of land prior&nbsp; to the insurrection against the American authorities, it might be well to examine the oral testimony also.</p><p>The first witness presented by the petitioner was Francisco Mavia, 40 years of age, resident of Malolos, Bulacan. This witness testified that he knew the deceased, Eulogio Revilla; that before his death the deceased was in possession of three parcels of land within the jurisdiction of the town of Calumpit; that one of these parcels is in Tumana, one in Calumpang, and one in Umanat; that he was the encargado or administrator of these lands&nbsp; for Revilla from 1891 up until the commencement of the revolution; that every year during his administration, all of these three parcels of land were cultivated; that during the revolution Guillermo Crisostomo took possession&nbsp; of one parcel&nbsp; and a man&nbsp; called Ninoy took possession of another one.&nbsp;&nbsp; This witness then proceeded to&nbsp; give&nbsp; the names of the&nbsp; owners of&nbsp; the land adjoining these three parcels at that time.</p><p>The second witness presented was Juan Borja,&nbsp; 70 years of age and a resident of Calumpit.&nbsp; This witness stated that he was well acquainted with the deceased Revilla; that he (Revilla) was&nbsp; in&nbsp; possession&nbsp; for&nbsp; a number of&nbsp; years of three parcels of land situated in&nbsp; Calumpang, Umanat, and Tumana; that&nbsp; Revilla and the parties from&nbsp; whom he acquired these lands were in possession of the same since 1887; that he knew this to be a fact because he was one of the laborers of the deceased and&nbsp; assisted in cultivating these lands; that he&nbsp; was present and&nbsp; pointed out&nbsp; to the commissioner&nbsp; Vicente Enriquez, clerk of the court, the location&nbsp; and boundaries of these three parcels&nbsp; when this commissioner&nbsp; placed Revilla in possession of all&nbsp; three parcels;&nbsp; that Revilla&nbsp; continued in possession of the same until his death, after which his wife and daughter remained in possession up to the time of the&nbsp; revolution, when they were&nbsp; dispossessed of a portion of these lands; that he accompanied the surveyor when said&nbsp; lands were surveyed. This witness also gave the boundaries at that time.</p><p>The third witness called was Donato Bayan, who testified that the deceased Revilla was in&nbsp; possession of the three parcels of land in question from 1891 and 1892 up to the time&nbsp; of his death;&nbsp; that during all&nbsp; these years Revilla cultivated the three parcels; that he had personal knowledge of these facts because he, in 1891, owned lands joining one of these parcels.</p><p>The fourth witness for the petitioner was Emeterio Manlapit, 47 years of age, a laborer, and resident of Calumpit, who testified that he knew the deceased Revilla; that the deceased owned and possessed three parcels of land situated in Umanat, Calumpang, and Tumana; that during the ten years in which the&nbsp; deceased possessed these lands he was one of the laborers who cultivated the same for the deceased; that the latter was&nbsp; never interrupted in the possession of said lands during that time; that upon the death of Revilla, his wife&nbsp; and&nbsp; daughter continued&nbsp; in the&nbsp; possession and cultivation of these&nbsp; parcels of land;&nbsp; that some time after the deceased died a man by the name of Ninoy&nbsp; (Saturnino Letingco), against the will of the widow, took possession of a part of these lands.</p><p>The appellee Guillermo&nbsp; Crisostomo,&nbsp; 74 years of&nbsp; age, laborer, resident of Malolos,&nbsp; testifying as witness in his own behalf, pointed out on the plan the two parcels&nbsp; in Umanat and Calumpang and stated that these two parcels were his property, he having acquired a part of the same by purchase and the other part by inheritance from&nbsp; his parents, Jorge Crisostomo and Gervasia Dimaliuat;&nbsp; that he had had five lawsuits over these two parcels; that during the proceedings which&nbsp; resulted in the issuance of a grant by the State to Revilla, he signed the&nbsp; <i>expediente </i>as owning land on&nbsp; the south of those parcels for which title was sought; that his sister Escolastica Cris6stomo did not sign this&nbsp; <i>expediente </i>for the reason that she was&nbsp; single and consulted him about all her acts.</p><p>The next witness presented for the opposition was Saturnino Litingco,&nbsp; husband of the&nbsp; appellee,&nbsp; Isabel Angelo, 66 years of age, resident of the barrio of San Vicente, Malolos, Bulacan.&nbsp; After pointing out on the plan the lands claimed by his&nbsp; wife, he stated that these lands were inherited by his wife from her father, Hermogenes Angelo; that he and his wife have been for more than thirty years and are now in possession of these lands; that his father-in-law had a lawsuit with Maria Soledad over the possession and title to these two small parcels in 1878, and that&nbsp; the court in that suit,&nbsp; by a final judgment, decreed possession and title to his father-in-law; that after the death of his father-in-law, they had another suit over the same lands with Maria Soledad with the same result; that since the termination of&nbsp; these suits they have had quiet and peaceful possession of&nbsp; these lands without interruption; that it is true that he and&nbsp; his wife sold certain lands inherited by his wife from her father, located in Umanat, to Felix Bautista and Fruto Roxas.</p><p>The&nbsp; foregoing testimony considered&nbsp; together&nbsp; with the documentary evidence, establishes the fact that the deceased Revilla was in continuous possession of all&nbsp; the three parcels of land sought to be inscribed&nbsp; for some time prior to the issuance of the State&nbsp; grant and&nbsp; up to the time of his death. This testimony also establishes the fact that after the death of Revilla, his widow&nbsp; and children continued in the peaceful possession of these&nbsp; three&nbsp; parcels&nbsp; of land up until&nbsp; they were dispossessed by the&nbsp; appellees,&nbsp; sometime&nbsp; during the insurrection.</p><p>Whether or not a State grant of the character of the one issued to Revilla can be annulled at the instance of&nbsp; a private person,&nbsp; we find it&nbsp; unnecessary&nbsp; to decide;&nbsp; but before this can be done, if it can be done at all, the testimony of the person seeking such relief, before it can&nbsp; overcome the acts of the officials who carried on the proceedings which resulted in the issuance of the State grant, must be clear, positive, and conclusive.&nbsp; The testimony of the appellees in&nbsp; this case falls far short of these requirements.</p><p>We concluded that the trial&nbsp; court erred in its findings of fact&nbsp; and conclusions of law and we therefore ordered the judgment&nbsp; rendered&nbsp; in accordance&nbsp; with&nbsp; the above&nbsp; short decision.</p><p><em> Arellano, C.
