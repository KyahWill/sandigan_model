				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The plaintiff and appellant claimed that he, the defendant, and one Castro were partners in the management of a cockpit.   The defendant denied this.  The court found that no such partnership existed and ordered judgment for the defendant.  The plaintiff moved for a new trial, which was denied.  To this order and the judgment he excepted and has brought here the evidence on which the court below based  its finding.   We  have examined the evidence and are of the opinion that said finding, so far as the existence of the copartnership to September 1, 1901, is concerned, is plainly and manifestly against the evidence.</p>
<p>We  reach this conclusion chiefly from the  documents written by the defendant and sent to the plaintiff.  It is not contradicted that the plaintiff demanded by letter of the defendant a  settlement of  their  accounts.  These demands the defendant answered with the folloAving letter:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"MY  DEAR  BOY: I   am  working at  these  accounts. Perhaps I will have them ready tomorrow morning.   But I have no money, unless Mr. Spitz comes on 6ne of  these boats, when we will have funds.</p>
  <p>"Yours, "FLORENTINO RALLOS.</p>
  <p>"April 13,1902."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On  May 7 the defendant wrote another letter to  the plaintiff  which is in part as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="right"> "CEBU, <em>May 7,1902.</em></p>
  <p>"Senor DON ESCOLASTICO DUTERTE.</p>

<p>"DEAR BOY: In  your letter which I received this afternoon,  you designate me as a little less than embezzler.  I have in my possession the money of no one but myself.   If I have not called you an embezzler  or something worse on account of all that you have done and are doing with me, reflect whether you have reason to write me in the manner you do.  I have done you a favor  in admitting you into the  cockpit  partnership, as the only manner  in which I might collect what you owe me.  I think you have made a mistake, and I will frankly refresh your memory.  You are indebted  to  me nearly one  thousand pesos,  advanced for vour former market contract,"</p></blockquote>
<p>In the preceding year, the defendant sent to the plaintiff statements of the business for the months of June, July, and August.  They  are in legal effect the same.  The one for July is as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Ticoy stands for the plaintiff.</p>
<p>That the plaintiff rendered  services in the management of the cockpit, and that the  defendant  paid him money on account  of the cockpit,  is undisputed.</p>
<p>The defendant, after denying that the plaintiff was his partner, testified, among other things, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The profits were divided.   A portion was given to  two friends, Senores Duterte and Castro, but  not as partners. A portion was given to Senor Duterte solely  because he was a friend who aided and encouraged the cockpit.   I did not have an agreement Avith them.  As a private individual, he had no duty to perform, except when he had to preside at the cockpit.  I am  not  aware that they, or either of them, rendered  other services.  I did not tell them  the reason Avhy I gave  them a share.   I paid  them  for  my pleasure, as friends.   Duterte had no legal interest.</p>
  <p>"Senor Duterte had no authority to employ any person in the cockpit; this function was exercised solely by Benor Isabelo Alburo, since I gave Seiior Duterte a portion only as a friend."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Castro, the other  supposed  partner, and a  witness  for the defendant, denied that he was such partner, but his testimony is in part as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"I do not remember what the profit was, but, as I have said, Senor Rallos sent me $20 or $30.   I did not keep any account.  I did not receive money monthly, but on Mondays Senor Rallos  would send me  some money.   Senor Rallos began to send me money from February, 1901.   I am sure it was about that time.   It may have been a little later.  I did not receive any money before that time.   It is true that the amount was from 20  to 30 pesos, and this money was what was obtained on the preceding  Sunday in the cockpit.  I  think Senor  Rallos sent it to me as a present for the reason that he  could not be present at the cockpit. I am not a servant or employee of the cockpit.  I have not had any conversation with Senor Rallos with reference to the business.  When Senor Rallos sent me the  monev he sent me no letter.   He sent it to me by a  messenger.  I think that Senor Rallos sent me that money because I went to the cockpit and helped the  president on account of the former.  Senor Rallos  asked me to go to the cockpit.  Yes, I have had a conversation with  Senor Rallos.   In this conversation Senor Hallos said nothing to me about money. Senor Rallos  asked me  to  go to  the cockpit to aid the  president.   It is not true, as I went to the cockpit only to do him a favor."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We  have, then, ,the  testimony of the plaintiff that  he made a verbal contract of partnership with  the defendant for this business, uncontradicted evidence that he performed services in connection  with it; that the defendant paid him money on account thereof and sent him accounts for three months showing his interest to be one-third of the profits, in addition to  the $5 each day, and wrote  him a letter in. which he said that he admitted the plaintiff into the partnership in order to collect what the plaintiff owed him on another transaction.</p>
<p>The reason  which the defendant gives for paying the plaintiff money is not credible.</p>
<p>We see no way of explaining the accounts submitted by the defendant  to plaintiff on any  theory other than that there was a  partnership between them up to September 1, 1901, at least.   The letter of the defendant, in which he says that he admitted the plaintiff into the partnership, can be explained on no other theory.</p>
<p>That there was  an agreement to  share  the  profits  is clearly proved  by the accounts submitted. The plaintiff testified that the profits and losses  were  to  be shared equally.  But even omitting this testimony, the case  is covered by article 1689 of the Civil Code, which provides that,  in the  absence  of agreement as to  the losses, they shall be shared as the gains are.</p>
<p>Article 1668  of the Civil  Code is not applicable to the case.   No real  estate was  contributed by  any  member. The partnership did not. become the owner of the cockpit. It is undisputed that this was owned by the defendant and that the partnership  paid him ten dollars a day for the use of it.</p>
<p>Neither can the judgment be sustained on the ground stated by the court in its  decision and  relied upon by counsel for the appellee here, namely, that Castro should have  been joined  as  a party  to the suit.  One of the grounds for demurrer mentioned in section 91 of the Code of Civil Procedure is "that there  is a defect  or misjoinder of parties plaintiff or defendants."  No demurrer  was interposed on this or  any other ground, and  by the terms of section 93 of the same Code, by omitting to demur on this ground the defendant waived the objection which he now makes.</p>
<p>The finding of fact by the court below, that there was no partnership, at least to September 1, 1901, was plainly and manifestly against  the  evidence, and  for that reason a new trial of this case must be had.  In this new trial, if the evidence is the same as upon the first trial, the plaintiff will be entitled to an  accounting, at least to September 1, 1901, and for such further term as the proof  upon the new trial shows, in  the opinion  of the court below, that the partnership existed; that accounting can be had in this suit and a final judgment rendered for the plaintiff if any balance appears in his favor.  No second or other suit will be necessary.</p>
<p>The judgment of the  court below is reversed and the case remanded  for a  new trial,  with the  costs of  this instance against the appellee,  and  after the expiration  of twenty days,  reckoned  from  the  date of  this  decision, judgment shall  be rendered accordingly,  and the case  is returned to the  court below for compliance therewith.</p>
