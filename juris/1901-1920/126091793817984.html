				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. SANTIAGO DE LOS SANTOS, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The appellant in this case, Santiago de los Santos, was charged with the crime of robbery, as defined and penalized in paragraph 5 of article 503 of the Penal Code, and was convicted of the crime of "robbery in an armed band in a deserted place"  (<em>en cuadrilla y despoblado</em>), as defined and penalized in article 504 of the Penal Code, and sentenced to eight years'  imprisonment (<em>presidio  mayor</em>)  with the accessories prescribed by law, the  payment of costs, and the indemnification of the person from whom the property was taken in the sum of P335, Philippine currency.</p>
<p>The evidence adduced  at  the trial fully  sustains the guilt of the accused of the crime of robbery, as charged in the  complaint.  We  are  of  opinion, however,  that the court erred in  finding the accused guilty of  the crime of "robbery in an  armed band in a deserted place"5 Phil. 565 as defined in article 504 of the Penal  Code, that being a higher offense than the  crime of simple robbery,  with  which he  was charged, which is  defined and penalized in article 503 of the said code.  It  does not appear from the evidence that there were more than three persons who took part in the commission of the  offense, and an armed band (<em>madrilla</em>) is defined in article 505 of the Penal Code as one composed of more than three individuals; and while it is true that the offense was committed in a deserted place (<em>en despoblado</em>) and that had the  accused  been  charged with the crime of "robbery  in a deserted  place" he might properly have been convicted of that crime under the provisions of article 504, nevertheless,  as he was charged only  with simple robbery, the fact that it  was proven to  have been committed in a deserted  place should only have been taken into consideration  as an aggravating  circumstance of the simple offense of robbery,  as defined in article 503 and as provided for in paragraph 15 of article 10 of said code.</p>
<p>We therefore reverse  the judgment and sentence of the trial court, and find said Santiago  de los Santos guilty as charged in the complaint of the crime of robbery, as defined and  penalized in paragraph 5 of article 503,  with the aggravating circumstance  that the crime was committed in a deserted place, and sentence him to eight years imprisonment (<em>presidio mayor</em>)  with  the accessory penalties prescribed by law, to the payment  to Co-Quico, from wham the property was taken, of the  sum of P335, Philippine currency, and to the payment of the costs of both instances. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano,  C. J., Mapa, Johnson, </em>and <em>Willard, JJ., </em>concur.<br>
