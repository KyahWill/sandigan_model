				<H3>JESUS VAÃ±O, APPLICANT AND APPELLANT, <I>VS.</I> THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, OBJECTOR AND APPELLEE.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">All, that applicant desires by these proceedings&nbsp; is to obtain title to a tract of land containing a little over 3,793 hectares, including&nbsp; within its boundaries four municipalities and constituting a not inconsiderable part of the entire Province of Bohol.&nbsp; Certainly a modest hope which, however, was thwarted by the oppositions entered by the Director of Lands and the Director of Forestry, and the adverse judgment of the Court of First Instance of Bohol, denying the registration of the land, with&nbsp; costs against the applicant, without prejudice.&nbsp; Applicant appeals.<br><br>To prove title, open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious occupation of the land by the applicant and his predecessors in interest since 1882, interrupted by the revolution, is relied upon.&nbsp; Included within the perimeter of the tract are approximately 685 hectares of forest land and four logging trails in the nature of highways.&nbsp; These portions should, without question, be eliminated from the claim.&nbsp; The Government concedes, however, that approximately 1,060 hectares are under cultivation and that certain other portions have been used by the claimant for pasturage.&nbsp; (See Exhibits A, 1, and 2.)&nbsp; But the doctrine of constructive possession announced in Ramos <i>vs.</i> Director of Lands ([1918], 39 Phil., 175) cannot be successfully advanced, for the claimant is not holding the land under color of title.&nbsp; To the tracts, of which applicant is in actual possession, he can secure title, on submission of proper plans.<br><br>Judgment is affirmed, with costs.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Mapa, C. J., Johnson, Araullo, Street</i> and <i>Villamor, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
