				<BR><STRONG>MAPA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The defendant, on March 28, 1906, executed in favor of the plaintiffs the following document:<br><blockquote>"<i>Vale</i> for the sum of P6,177.35 in favor of Messrs. Levy Brothers, as the balance of my account with them to date, payable in partial payments."<br></blockquote>The defendant made several partial payments and later claimed&nbsp; the&nbsp; right to establish, as a fixed rate&nbsp; for&nbsp; future payments, the installment of P30 a month. The plaintiffs, disagreeing with&nbsp; such a claim,&nbsp; brought suit against the defendant and asked that the latter be sentenced to pay them the sum of P5,862.35, the unpaid&nbsp; balance, or&nbsp; that a period be specified within which he should pay the same, in case the court should deem such manner of&nbsp; payment more equitable. Moreover, the plaintiffs demand in their complaint the sum of P355, which they claim the defendant owes them&nbsp; upon a&nbsp; debt. <br><br>The defendant alleged in his answer, and as a principal defense,&nbsp; that the debt contracted by him had not yet matured ; that this&nbsp; was shown by the terms of the instrument itself, inasmuch as it appears therein stipulated&nbsp; that the payment of the debt shall be made in&nbsp; installments;&nbsp; and that,&nbsp; in conformity with this stipulation, on various dates, prior to&nbsp; the&nbsp; filing of the complaint, he&nbsp; had&nbsp; made several partial payments aggregating the sum of P315, and&nbsp; subsequently deposited&nbsp; and still&nbsp; continued to deposit with the clerk&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; court, at the plaintiffs' disposal, the sum of P30&nbsp; a month, which deposits&nbsp; he had so made since the month of March, 1908, in view of the fact that&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiffs had refused to receive such money as partial&nbsp; payments. During the trial&nbsp; it was&nbsp; agreed by the parties that the sum&nbsp; which the defendant owed the plaintiffs&nbsp; on&nbsp; March 28, 1906, the&nbsp; date&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; aforementioned document, was P5,317.35.<br><br>In view of the evidence adduced&nbsp; at the&nbsp; trial,&nbsp; the&nbsp; court found that a monthly payment of P200 would be a reasonable compliance&nbsp; with the agreement to pay the debt&nbsp; in installments, and, in consequence of such finding, sentenced the defendant to pay to the plaintiffs the sum of P6,317.35 and ordered him&nbsp; to make payment thereof at the rate of P200 a month, on or before the 15th of each month, commencing with the 15th of April, 1909. Against this judgment the defendant appealed.<br><br>The defendant having&nbsp; bound&nbsp; himself to pay his debt to the plaintiffs <i>in partial payments</i>, as set forth in the note in question, it is seen that the obligation is one of payment by installments,&nbsp; since its fulfillment can not&nbsp; be required immediately nor does its existence depend upon the happening of any particular event. But, though the obligation is one of payment by installments, nevertheless&nbsp; no fixed day was specified&nbsp; for its fulfillment, so that the period&nbsp; for payment is undetermined or was not&nbsp; fixed by the parties when they executed the contract. Besides, it is evident that the term for payment was granted for the exclusive benefit of the defendant and&nbsp; for his own convenience, as by&nbsp; the language of the document, the plaintiffs gained nothing by the fact that the debt was&nbsp; not immediately demandable. Nor was&nbsp; any interest&nbsp; stipulated on the debt during&nbsp; the time that it should remain unpaid&nbsp; by&nbsp; the defendant.&nbsp; For the foregoing reasons, and in whatever manner this case be considered, it&nbsp; is unquestionable&nbsp; that it falls&nbsp; within the provisions&nbsp; of article 1128 of the Civil Code which&nbsp; is as follows:<br><blockquote>"Should&nbsp; the obligation&nbsp; not fix a period, but it can be inferred from its nature and circumstances that there was an intention to grant it to the debtor, the courts&nbsp; shall&nbsp; fix the duration of the same.<br><br>"The courts shall also fix the duration of the period when it may have been left to the will&nbsp; of the debtor."<br></blockquote>The obligation being manifestly defective&nbsp; with regard to the duration of the period&nbsp; granted to the debtor, that is, to the defendant, that defect must be&nbsp; cured by the courts through judicial decision&nbsp; which shall&nbsp; determine&nbsp; the said duration, under the power expressly granted them&nbsp; for such purpose by the legal provisions&nbsp; just above transcribed.<br><br>The trial court, therefore, acted in accordance with the law&nbsp; in exercising the said power in&nbsp; the&nbsp; present case,&nbsp; by fixing the duration of the period on the basis that the payment of the debt should be made at&nbsp; the rate of P200 a month; and we see no abuse of judicial discretion in fixing such&nbsp; a rate, considering the importance of the obligation and&nbsp; the absence of any stipulation of&nbsp; interest in favor of the creditors.<br><br>The appellant, grounding his argument on the fact of his having&nbsp; made three&nbsp; partial payments, in three different months, at the rate of P30 each, maintains that he can not be compelled&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay a&nbsp; greater amount&nbsp; monthly,&nbsp; for the reason,&nbsp; he says,&nbsp; that such&nbsp; payments,&nbsp; made&nbsp; and accepted without controversy between the parties, were a fulfillment and an explanation which, by their mutual accord, became agreed upon&nbsp; by them, of the words "in partial payments" contained in the document in question.&nbsp; This claim is in all&nbsp; respects untenable.&nbsp;&nbsp; The appellant&nbsp; made several other payments of different sums (of P25, P50, and P100), and even hypothetically admitting his argument, there could be no reason for&nbsp; saying that the sum of P30 a&nbsp; month was agreed upon, and not the amounts just above-mentioned, or any&nbsp; of them, as the regular rate for the partial payments of the debt,&nbsp; since all the sums mentioned were received, without any protest whatever, by the plaintiffs.&nbsp; The very diversity of the amounts of the various payments made&nbsp; by the defendant clearly shows that there was&nbsp; no&nbsp; agreement, either express or implied, that such&nbsp; payments were to&nbsp; be effected at the rate&nbsp; of&nbsp; exactly P30&nbsp; a month.&nbsp;&nbsp; The mere fact&nbsp; of the plaintiffs having&nbsp; accepted and received the said payments, is not and can not in&nbsp; any&nbsp; manner be considered as an expression or proof of such an agreement, especially because, as the plaintiffs' manager stated in&nbsp; his testimony, "on seeing that Mr. Paterno insisted&nbsp; on paying only P30 a month, we refused to accept&nbsp; it."<br><br>The amount due by the&nbsp; defendant on March 28,&nbsp; 1906, was that of P5,317.35, according to agreement of the parties during the trial.&nbsp; The evidence&nbsp; clearly shows that the defendant paid on account of the said debt the following sums: June 6,&nbsp; 1906, P100; September 4, 1906, P50;&nbsp; January 8, 1907, P25; April&nbsp; 1, 1907, P50; August 3, 1907, P30; September 3, 1907, P30; and October&nbsp; 3, 1907, P30; which amounts aggregate the sum of P315.&nbsp; This sum should be deducted&nbsp; from&nbsp; the&nbsp; said&nbsp; debt and&nbsp; the balance,&nbsp; P5,002.35, remaining against the defendant,&nbsp; is&nbsp; the amount which he should be sentenced,&nbsp; as&nbsp; we hereby&nbsp; sentence him,&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay to the plaintiffs,&nbsp; and not&nbsp; that of&nbsp; P5,317.35, set forth in the judgment appealed from.<br><br>With this sole modification, we affirm the said judgment, without&nbsp; express finding&nbsp; as to&nbsp; the costs&nbsp; of this instance. So ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J.,&nbsp; Carson, Moreland, </i>and <i>Trent, JJ.</i>, concur.<br></div>
