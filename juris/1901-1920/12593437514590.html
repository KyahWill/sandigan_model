				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> Matea Jose and Sotera Galves;  were charged with the crime of <em>estafa </em>committed as follows: That  Matea Jose and Sotera Galvez on the 2d  day of  December, 1901, received  from Benita Varela twelve pieces  of jusi cloth of the value of 300  pesos,  and forty  pieces of pina cloth of the value of 200 pesos, as a deposit on commission for administration, under the obligation to sell  the same and return the profits thereof to the said Benita Varela; that the said Matea Jose and Sotera Galvez refused afterwards to deliver to the said Benita Varela either the cloth or the money derived from the sale of the same.  The defendants were tried in the Court of First  Instance  in  the city  of Manila and  acquitted of the charge.</p>
<p> The acquittal of the defendants was based upon the fact that such contradictions were found in the evidence as  to cause a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the defendants. We have examined the testimony  and find many discrepancies which seem to justify  the conclusion reached by the Court of First Instance.   The prosecuting witness, Benita Varela, in her testimony states that on the 2d day of December, 1901, she delivered to the defendants, Sotera Galvez and Matea Jose, twelve .pieces  of jusi cloth  and forty pieces of pina cloth with  the understanding that the cloth was to be sold and money paid over, or the goods returned that same evening.  That the defendants disappeared and never returned again; that  Sotera had been her laundry woman for two or  three years; that the goods were delivered to the defendants jointly, but on the faith of her acquaintance with  Sotera.   In her testimony she says that she began to look, for Sotera after Christmas and contradicts this by saying that she began the search for Sotera on the day the goods were delivered to her, December 2.  She says that she saw Sbtera only once afterwards, then testifies that she saw her twice. She testifies  that Sotera continued as her laundry woman until the date of arrestâ€”13th of February.  Sotera also testifies this.  It is hardly probable that the witness should have retained Sotera as laundry woman if such defalcation had occurred, and still less probahle if Sotera so continued that the witness should <em>not have</em> seen her quite frequently.</p>
<p> The witness testifies that she never had a like transaction with the defendants except on December 2, when the twelve pieces of  jusi and  forty pieces  of pina were delivered.   The testimony of the accused Sotera shows that she had been in the habit for a long time of taking goods on  commission from the prosecuting witness.   Both defendants deny the occurrence out of which the prosecution arose,  but testify  to previous  transactions had with  the prosecuting witness.</p>
<p> There are other discrepancies in the statements  made by the prosecuting  witness  and  also in the  statements made by  the other  witnesses produced.  While  there is evidence to show that the transaction occurred, as stated by the prosecuting witness, and testimony showing a confession by the  defendants of having had a transaction with the prosecuting witness on the date mentioned,  still there are such discrepancies in the evidence  as  would  cause a reasonable doubt, and the Court of First Instance did not err in  acquitting the defendants.</p>
<p> The  judgment of  acquittal is affirmed, with costs <em>de oficio.</em></p>
<p> <em>Arellano,  C. J.,  Torres,  Smith,  Willard,  Mapa,</em> and <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
