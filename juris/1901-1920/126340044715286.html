				G.R. No. 2892, November 16, 1906</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES,  PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. FELIX ORTEGA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This case was instituted upon the following complaint: "That on or about the 5th day of April, 1903, the defendant, Felix Ortega, willfully and unlawfully, and by and through gross and reckless negligence, executed an  act which, if done with malice, would have constituted a grave crime—viz, that of murder—in that the said Felix Ortega, representing and pretending to be a regularly licensed and practicing physician, did prescribe and administer and direct and cause to be administered to one Garlos Clark, an infant of the age of six days, dangerous and poisonous medicines, chemicals, and substances, in large and dangerous  quantities, from the  effect of which the said Carlos Clark  then and there died."  The foregoing complaint was filed on the 10th of September, 1904. Theretofore, to wit, on  the 23d of September, 1903,  the defendant had been sentenced to ninety days' imprisonment and  a fine of 150  dollars, or in default thereof to suffer thirty days' subsidiary imprisonment for practicing medicine without a license, that prosecution having arisen  out of the  same facts.   He commenced to serve sentence on  the same day but was subsequently pardoned by the Chief Executive of  the unexpired portion of such  sentence December 8, 1903.</p>
<p>It appears  from the evidence that the  defendant was called  by the father of the child on the 5th of April, 1903, between  8 and 9 o'clock in the morning, and the former prescribed certain medicine for  the child who, according to the father, seemed  to improve after it was administered; and that, the child growing worse about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, the father again called on the defendant, who gave the prescription attached to the record, and to which the expert testimony, introduced in evidence, relates.</p>
<p>Of the medicine so prescribed by the defendant, a teaspoonful was administered to the child about 6 o'clock in the evening, and another teaspoonf ul about two hours later, after  which the father gave the  child no  more of this medicine in view of its lethargic condition and subsequent convulsions which continued until 2 o'clock in the morning when  the child died.</p>
<p>Dr. Carter, Commissioner of  Public Health, testified as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Q. Would the administering of that quantity of chloral in your opinion produce death  in the average case, or an ordinary case, or not?</p>
  <p>"A. In a child of six days of age it would be exceedingly risky; it would not be  a safe dose" (p. 96). Dr. Robert E. L,  Newberne, medical inspector of the Board of Health, testified as follows:</p>
  <p>"Q. State whether or not, in your opinion, the administering of the two  doses of approximately two grains of chloral within a period of  two  hours to a child six days old would cause death.</p>
  <p>"A. If it entered the circulation, if it were absorbed, I think  it would.</p>
  <p>"Q.  That is, you mean by that, if it were retained upon the stomach?</p>
  <p>"A.  Retained, or if it entered the circulation there might be some circumstances  which would render it impossible; it is highly probable though, that it would be exceedingly dangerous" (pp. 100,101).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr.  W. E. Musgrave testified as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Q.  What, in your opinion, would be the effect of administering to a child  six  days old of two doses of the prescription, Exhibit A?</p>
  <p>"A.  They would be exceedingly dangerous.</p>
  <p>"Q.  Would  it, in your opinion, cause the  death of the infant?</p>
  <p>"A.  As I  stated before, the poison from chloral hydrate has an uncertain effect, there are records of  1.2 grams in a dose killing an adult; on the other hand, there are records of a case recovering from an ounce and a half without treatment, whatever.  I  would not state that  it would cause death, but I would state  that it would be very dangerous.</p>
  <p>"Q. Would it probably cause death?</p>
  <p>"A. Following the  directions  of  the prescription, Exhibit A, it would probably cause  death in the amount prescribed.  This would be between 20,22, and 24 doses to the bottle; he has 100  cubic  centimeters of  liquid and the soluble substances are all soluble without increasing the amount."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally the witness P. G. Woolley testified as follows (p. 108):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Q. Please examine this document, Exhibit A, and say whether in your judgment the medicine prescribed in that prescription in  the  doses therein given are  proper for a child six years of age.</p>
  <p>"A. I believe not.</p>
  <p>"Q. Why?</p>
  <p>"A. I think the doses of chloral are too large.</p>
  <p>"Q. What then, in your opinion, would be the effect of administering the chloral prescribed by that prescription on a child six days old?</p>
  <p>"A. Well, it would depend  entirely on the child; the question of idiosyncrasy, the question of  the condition of the child at the time, the contents of the stomach, and the instructions under which the medicine was  administered enter into it, and I could not say what they would be, but what they might be.</p>
  <p>"Q. What are those?</p>
  <p>"A. It might be that it would quiet the child and cause sleep, it might  be that it would cause more  than that, might cause coma, and it might be that  it  would  cause death."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The defendant is held responsible for the  death  of the Clark child.  The charge against him is that he administered to it  a  certain medicine, after  which  the  child died.   No attempt has been made to show that the medicine thus administered was the only cause of the child's  death. It might have been, it may be that it was; that is all that the witnesses said in hypothetical testimony without having the body of  the child  before  them,  and without a postmortem of the same having been made; in other words, without any knowledge even of the aspect of the child after death.   On the other hand, there is nothing in the certificate of death showing that there was anything abnormal about the death of the child.</p>
<p>A  possibility is not an actual fact, probability is  not certainty, and certainty requires positive proof of the commission of the  crime, whether maliciously committed or through  merely reckless negligence;  it does  not matter how.   Consequently, there being no  evidence that the defendant caused the death of the Clark child by administering the medicine in  question, he  can not be convicted of homicide through reckless negligence.</p>
<p>The judgment of the court below is accordingly reversed and .the defendant, Felix Ortega, is hereby acquitted with the costs <em>de oficio</em>.   After the expiration of ten days from the date of final judgment the case  will  be remanded to the court below for  execution.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson, Willard, </em>and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
