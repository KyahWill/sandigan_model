				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This action was brought by the plaintiff as administrator of the estate of To-Tico to recover the sum of 30,000 pesos for the death  of  the said  To-Tico, which  death, it, was alleged, was caused by the negligence of  the  defendant. The defendant appeared in the court below  and answered the complaint,  and on the 16th day of July, 1906, judgment was entered against him for the sum of 3,000 pesos.   He moved for a new trial in the court below, which was denied on the 4th of August, 1906, a bill of exceptions was signed therein on the  18th day of August, 1906, and was filed in this court on the 27th of the same month.  On the 15th of that month the defendant died.   On the 14th of September, 1906, the plaintiff made a motion in this court that  the special administratrix appointed in the matter of the estate of the deceased, Lorenzo del Rosario, be substituted as defendant in  this  appeal.  This motion  was  denied by an order made on  the  15th  day of October.   The plaintiff has now moved that the appeal  be suspended in  order  that he may present his claim before the commissioners who have been appointed in  the proceeding for the administration and settlement of the estate of the deceased.</p>
<p>We denied the motion for the substitution of the special administratrix on the ground, as will be seen from the order denying it, that a special administratrix could not be made a defendant.   We did not hold in that order that a general administrator could not be substituted in the action,  and in  the case of  Azarraga  vs.  Cortes,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> No. 2834, decided November  21,  1906, we  have just  held that where the defendant in a case dies after a  final judgment rendered in the Court of  First Instance against him the proviso in section 119 of the Code of Civil Procedure does not  apply, and that the action in case of an appeal  can be carried on against the general administrator appointed in the matter of the estate of the deceased defendant.</p>
<p>In the case  at bar the plaintiff can ask substitution of such general administrator.  This  motion  is accordingly denied.   So ordered.</p>
<em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
