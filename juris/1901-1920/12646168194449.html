				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE, VS. EUSTAQUIO DALIGDIG, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This case  was  brought up in consultation of the  judgment of  August 26,  1902.   While  it  was pending in this court Mr. Smith, attorney for the defendant, filed a motion asking that  his client, Eustaquio Daligdig,  be included in the amnesty of July 4, 1902, upon the ground that the crime of double murder was committed while the defendant was a captain  in the revolutionary  army, and occurred prior to the 1st of May of said year.</p>
<p>The Solicitor-General concurs in this motion, upon the ground that  the record discloses  that the  murders  in question were committed by the defendant in the course of the  insurrection against the government  of  the United States established in these Islands, and that they were the result of internal political feuds between the accused and the deceased.</p>
<p>The record of this ease shows that one day in the month of February, 1901, the defendant, Daligdig, who was at that time a captain in the revolutionary forces,  and two men under his command, arrested two persons, unknown, in the barrio of Manilla, of the town of Langaran, Misamis, and conducted them  toward  the outskirts  of the town; that on the road the defendant ordered his two soldiers to kill the  prisoners, which order was  carried  out, the prisoners being stabbed to death.  On the body of each one of the deceased a placard was placed reading,  "Traitor to the country."   The corpses  were left unburied for three days.  Several witnesses testified that these  men  were arrested  and killed because  they were suspected  of being traitors to the revolutionary cause.</p>
<p>Upon  the supposition that the belief that these men were traitors was the sole motive which led to the  commission of the double crime of murder for which the defendant  was  condemned to death—the  record  containing no evidence whatever indicating that any other  motive impelled the defendant to direct the killing of the deceased—it is unquestionable that the murders, perpetrated are of a political  character and the result of internal hatreds existing between the two murdered Filipinos and the  accused, who was a  captain in the  revolutionary army,  in arms against the government established in the Province of Misamis.</p>
<p>In a normal condition of society the severest punishment is meted  out for the odius crime which was  committed by order of the defendant.  However, considering  the circumstances under which these crimes were committed, and the fact that the sovereign power in these Islands, in view of the  extraordinary and radical disturbance which, during the  period following the year 1896,  prevailed in and convulsed this  country,  and prompted  by  the dictates  of humanity and public  policy, has deemed it advisable to blot out  even the shadow of a certain  class of offenses, decreeing full pardon and amnesty to their authors—an act of elevated statesmanship and timely generosity, more political  than judicial in its nature, intended to mitigate the severity of the law—it is incumbent upon us, in deciding this case,  to conform our judgment to the requirements and conditions of the decree so promulgated.</p>
<p>In view of  the  foregoing considerations, we decide that Eustaquio  Daligdig is  included within  the amnesty of July 4, 1902.  The judge below Avill  be notified  of "this decision,  and, as soon as the defendant,  Eustaquio Daligdig, shall have taken the oath prescribed in the. amnesty proclamation, evidence of which Avill be  submitted to this court,  he will be set at liberty.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Cooper, McDonough,</em> and <em>Mapa, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em> Willard, J.,</em> dissents.</p>
