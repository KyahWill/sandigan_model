				<H3>THE  UNITED STATES,  PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE,  VS.  R. W. ALMOND, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>R.  W.  Almond was charged with the violation of the provisions of the act of Congress of March 3,1903,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> entitled "An act  to regulate the immigration  of aliens into the United States."</p>
<p>The complaint allegesâ€”</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"That the said R, W. Almond was between the dates of October 20 and October 30, 1904, master and in charge of the steamship <em>Rubi</em>, which, on or about October 27, 1904, did bring to the Philippine Islands from the British port of Hongkong, China, one Tawas Tahan, an alien of East India,  afflicted with trachoma, a  loathsome  contagious disease. The said R. W. Almond, on or about October 27, 1904, did  permit the said  Tawas Tahan to land in the Philippine Islands from the said steamship <em>Rubi</em> at a place and time other than that designated  by the immigration officers, and contrary to the express instructions issued by the said immigration officers."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Violations of this act are penalized by sections 8,18, and 19, which are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"SEC. 8.  That any person, including the master, agent, owner,  or consignee  of any vessel, who shall bring into or land in the United  States, by vessel or otherwise, or who shall attempt, by himself or through another, to bring into or land in the United States, by vessel or otherwise,  any alien not duly admitted by an immigrant inspector, or not lawfully entitled to enter  the  United  States, shall  be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall, on conviction, be punished by a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars for each and  every  alien so landed or attempted to be landed, or by imprisonment  for a term not less than three months nor more than two years, or by both such fine and imprisonment."</p>
  <p>"SEC. 18.  That it shall be the duty of the owners, officers, an agents of  any vessel bringing an  alien to the United States to adopt due precautions to prevent the landing of any such alien from such vessel at any time or place other than that designated by the immigration officers, and any such owner, officer,  agent,  or person in charge  of such vessel who shall land or  permit to land any alien at any time or place other  than  that designated by the immigration officers, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall on conviction  be punished  by a  fine for each  alien so permitted to land of  not less than one  hundred nor more than one thousand dollars, or by  imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year, or by both such fine and imprisonment, and every such alien so landed shall be deemed to be unlawfully in the United States and shall be deported, as provided by law.</p>
  <p>"SEC.  19. That  all aliens brought into this  country in violation of law shall, if practicable, be immediately sent back to the countries whence they respectively came on the vessels bringing them.  The  cost of  their maintenance while on land, as well as the expense of the return of such aliens, shall be borne by the owner or owners of the vessels on  which they  respectively came; and  if any master, person in  charge, agent, owner, or consignee of any  such vessels shall refuse to receive back on board  thereof, or of any other vessel owned by the same interest, such aliens, or shall neglect to detain them thereon, or shall refuse or neglect to return them to the foreign port from  which they came, or to pay  the cost of their maintenance while on land, such  master,  person in charge, agent,  owner,  or consignee shall be deemed  guilty of a misdemeanor and shall, on conviction, be punished by a fine of not less than three hundred dollars for each and every such offense; and no  such  vessel  shall have clearance from any port of the United  States  while any such fine is unpaid: <span style="font-style: italic;">Provided</span>, That the Commissioner-General of Immigration, under the direction or with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, may suspend, upon conditions to be prescribed by the Commissioner-General, the deportation of any alien found to  have  come  under promise or agreement of labor or service of any kind  if, in his judgment, the testimony of such alien is necessary on behalf of the United States Government in the prosecution of offenders against the provisions of sections four and five of  this act: <span style="font-style: italic;">Provided</span>, That the cost of maintenance of any person so detained resulting from such  suspension of deportation shall  be  paid from the "immigrant fund," but no alien certified, as provided in section  seventeen of this act,  to be  suffering with a loathsome or with a dangerous  contagious  disease  other than one of a quarantinable nature,  shall be permitted to land for medical treatment thereof in the hospitals of the United States."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We think the evidence of record sufficient to sustain the contention of the defendant that he adopted due precautions to prevent the landing of the said Tawas Tahan, and that if the landing was made it was made without defendant's knowledge or consent, and despite the precautions taken to prevent it.</p>
<p>Since the accused neither willfully nor negligently permitted the alien to land, it is manifest that a conviction could not be had under sections  8 or 19 (Hackfeld &amp; Co. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. U. S., 197 U. S., 442), and  therefore the prosecution relies on the provisions of section 18,  which in some respects is more comprehensive in its terms that either of the other two,  being applicable to all cases where an alien is landed or permitted to land at any time  or place other than that designated by the immigration officers.</p>
<p>It is contended that the language of this provision makes the owner, officer, agent, or person in  charge of a vessel responsible criminally,  and at all events where an alien lands from the vessel at any time or place other than that designated by the immigration officers,  or, in other  words, that the officer or person in charge is criminally responsible in all such cases, even though he has taken every possible precaution and  done all in his power to prevent the unlawful landing.</p>
<p>The defendant, on the contrary, contends that the word "permit," as used in section 18 of the statute, implies that the landing of the alien, to constitute a criminal offense, must be with the express or  tacit consent of the owner, officer, agent, or person in charge of the vessel.</p>
<p>The Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia defines the word "permit" as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"1. To suffer or allow to be, come to pass, or take place, by tacit consent or by not prohibiting or hindering; allow without expressly authorizing.</p>
  <p>"2. To grant leave or liberty by express consent; allow expressly; give leave, liberty, or license to; as, a license that <em>permits</em> a person to sell intoxicating liquors."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be seen that the word may be taken  as importing either consent, tacit or  express, or suffering, or allowing to be, to come to pass, or to take place, by merely not prohibiting or hindering; and the important question to be determined in this case is whether a conviction can be sustained when it appears that there was no consent, either tacit or express, to the landing of the alien, and at most a mere suffering  or allowing  to land by  not actually hindering.</p>
<p>The  statute is largely penal  in its  provisions, and in construing it the rule laid down by Chief Justice Marshall in United States vs. Wiltberger (5 Wheat, 76-95)  should be applied:</p>
<p>"The rule of penal laws to be construed strictly is perhaps not much less  old than  constructing  itself.  It is founded on the tenderness of  the law  for the rights of individuals; and on the plain principle that the power of punishment is vested in the legislative, not in the judicial department.   It is  the legislature, not the court, which is to define a crime and ordain its punishment."</p>
<p>The  statute imposes upon one  who has  brought  immigrant aliens into a United States port the duty of adopting due precautions to prevent the landing of any such alien at any time or place other than that designated by the immigration officers and fixes a penalty for permitting an alien so to land.</p>
<p>If by this requirement it was intended to make the ship owner or master an insurer at all hazards that all aliens aboard would strictly conform  with the orders of the  immigration officers, it would seem that Congress would have chosen terms more clearly indicative of such intention, and instead of using a word of uncertain meaning, would have affixed the penalty  in cases wherein the owner, master, or person in charge had permitted the alien to land in violation of law, either with or without fault on his part. Where the statute permits of a construction which does not require this absolute  insurance of the strict compliance by all the alien passengers aboard a vessel with the rules laid down by the  immigration officers,  but holds  the ship's officer to the care and diligence required by the circumstances, we do not feel inclined to adopt the construction least  favorable to  the accused.   This  statute  imports a duty, and in the absence  of a requirement that it shall be performed at all hazards, we think no more ought  to be required than a faithful and careful effort to carry out the duty imposed.</p>
<p>The act of Congress should be given a reasonable  interpretation,  with a view to effect its purpose to prevent the unlawful introduction of alien  immigrants into this country.  If this provision should be construed as making the ship's officer  criminally responsible at all hazards for every breach of the rules  of the immigration officers in regard to the landing of aliens, the ship's  officers would doubtless claim the right  to use all the force  necessary to avoid the penalty of the  law,  and to compel ail immigrant aliens  to comply with the rules laid down by the immigration officers.   What  would be the result of such power it  is easy to imagine.  It  is difficult  to see how a ship's officer could insure compliance with these rules by all alien passengers aboard his ship without such confinement and detention  as might result in great hardship to every immigrant passenger aboard his vessel, whether such passenger has or has not the  intention or desire  to violate any  law of this country.  We think this  statute was not intended to secure the obedience to all the rules of the immigration officers at all hazards,  but at most to require good faith and full diligence in  the effort to comply with them.</p>
<p>The foregoing argument is in large part  adopted  from the reasoning of the opinion  of the Supreme Court of the United States in  Hackfeld <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. United States, cited above, which  construes the provisions  of  section 19 of the Immigration Act.   We think the argument applies  with even greater force to the provisions of section  18.  Section 19 imposes a duty on ship's officers  and owners in connection with the return to the port whence they came of aliens who have unlawfully landed in the country,  while section 18 imposes a duty upon the owners of the vessel and its officers as to the control of all alien immigrants on board.  In the former case the harsh severity of the law, if it  were construed to mean that the owners and officers of the vessel are responsible criminally and at all hazards, would only affect the limited number of those aliens who had actually violated the law, whereas in the latter case it would impose unreasonable burdens and restrictions on all immigrants coming into  the country.</p>
<p>The judgment and sentence of the trial court is reversed, and the accused is acquitted of the offense with which he is charged, with the costs of both instances <em>de oficio</em>.  After twenty days  judgment will be entered in accordance herewith, and the bond for the appearance of the accused will be canceled  and the record  returned to the court from whence it came.   So ordered.</p>

I  concur in the  result.  It appears that an order had been issued by the proper authority and delivered to  the captain, directing him to detain Tawas Tahan on the ship for return to  Hongkong.   The case, therefore, comes clearly within  the provisions of  section  19, which is the only section applicable thereto.<br>
