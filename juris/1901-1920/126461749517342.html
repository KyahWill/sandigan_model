				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On January 28, 1903, the provincial fiscal of Ilocos  Sur filed an information charging Mateo Bumatay, municipal treasurer of  the town of Salcedo, with the crime of malversation of  public  funds,  defined and penalized  in article 390 of the Penal Code.  It was alleged that the defendant in October, 1902, received from one Lino de Abaya, deputy provincial treasurer,  the sum of $75 and some  odd cents for deposit in the municipal treasury, but that the defendant, instead of so depositing it, appropriated the money to his own use and  that he  failed to make any entry of the amount in the proper account book of the municipality.</p>
<p>Page 46 of  the record contains a document acknowledging  receipt of  $65.47, Mexican currency, signed September 20, 1902, by Mateo Bumatay.</p>
<p>From the  certified copies  of the account book of  the treasurer  of the municipality shown in  the  record, it appears that at the  beginning of September, 1902,  there was a balance  on hand of $240.47   On October 1 following the balance on hand  was $283.29, and on November 1 of the same  year there was only $132.64.</p>
<p>The witness  Lino de Abaya in his testimony stated that he had not delivered any  money to the defendant, but that the deputy treasurer, Mr. Archibald McFarland, while in Candon acting as deputy of the defendant, received from the witness the sum of $65.47, Mexican, and, immediately afterwards,  in the presence  of the  witness,  turned this money over to the defendant, Bumatay.  This statement was corroborated by the testimony of Deputy McParland, who stated that the delivery of the  sum mentioned took place on the 1st  or 2d of October, and that the defendant, Bumatay, gave him a proper receipt therefor.</p>
<p>The defendant  pleaded not guilty.  After  acknowledging the authenticity of his signature  in the account books and in the receipt on page 46, he stated that on the 27th of November of last year, while he was in bed, very ill, the vice-president and several members of the municipal council, together with the man who relieved him, entered his house and informed him that he had been removed from the office of municipal treasurer, and that they thereupon  seized the cash  box he had  in Ms house, with all the money which it contained, as well as the treasury books, but that  they  diet not prepare any inventory  or count  the money of  which they  had taken  possession, stating that this would be done in the office of the president of the municipality, as they themselves did not know how to count the American dollars and bank notes; that they promised him that  they would send him  the inventory and receipt that afternoon, but that  they failed to do so; that on  the following day the defendant's wife,  by  his direction, went to obtain  the  inventory and receipt, but that they gave her  evasive answers; and that,  notwithstanding various demands made for  the documents  mentioned, he did not. succeed in  obtaining either  of them. The witness added that the money  which was so  taken by the persons mentioned amounted to 347 Mexican pesos, of which 161 pesos belonged to the municipal treasurer and the remainder to himself;  that the persons mentioned informed him at that time that the accounts as found  agreed with the treasury books, but that five or six  days later they demanded $37  of him to cover  an  alleged shortage, which  sum the defendant's wife paid,  without,  however, succeeding in obtaining a receipt therefor.  The defendant further testified that he had received  from  McFarland the sum of $65.47, referred to, and that he got the  president to enter the amount  for him in  his account books; that he was accustomed to avail  himself of the assistance of the president for this purpose, as he, the defendant, made many mistakes; and that the book in which the entry was made was  among those taken from him by the persons mentioned.  Upon being shown the monthly account books for September and October, he said that he could not find an entry for the sum in question, but that such an entry had originally been made.  The defendant's wife and two other witnesses testified to the facts related by the defendant, to which they Avere eyewitnesses.   They also affirmed that the councilors took aAvay the account books and the money without  having made any inventory thereof, and without giving any receipt for the money so taken.</p>
<p>The municipal president, Dionisio Biloaon, testified that the defendant, Bumatay, Avhen removed from his office of treasurer, was found to have failed to enter in his books certain sums of money received by him.  This witness also testified that the accounts, after  being, balanced, showed a shortage; that the defendant, when asked to state what had  become of  the money lacking, replied  that it had been expended for  the benefit of the  municipality, that the witness did not remember how much money  had been delivered by the defendant  to the persons  who  went  to take the money from his house, but that this appears from the papers  of the municipality.  The witness further testified that  as soon as the shortage was  discovered, the defendant was made to pay over  the amount lacking and that the witness was assured by the councilors that they had made up the accounts in the presence of the defendant. The  witness stated that he and the municipal secretary assisted the accused in keeping the treasu^ account books and that, at the request of the defendant himself, he had frequently  made entries therein.   This witness  states  it was true that, at the time the defendant, Bumatay, was removed from his office no inventory Avas made,  but that the new treasurer made out  a receipt Avhich showed the; condition of the  accounts.</p>
<p>It is a fact admitted by the defendant himself that he received from Deputy McFarland  the sum of  $65.47, Mexican currency, evidenced by a receipt signed by him. This, however, is not  sufficient to justify the conclusion that this amount was embezzled by him, because, when the defendant was removed  from his  office  of treasurer (while very ill and in bed, and apparently on this account alone, for no other reason has been given, nor has it been shown by  what authority the removal  was made), the persons who effected this irregular removal and took charge of or seized the cash box and its  contents, as well as the books of the  treasury, failed to  observe the formalities prescribed by law.  They  did not count the  money which they received or seized, did  not examine the books, and made no inventory in the presence of the accused,  thus omitting all the precautions which the most  ordinary prudence and common sense  would dictate.   This unlawful proceeding was  carried  out  in  the presence of the defendant and of three other  persons, whose unimpeached testimony avc have before us.</p>
<p>The defendant states that the sum of 347 Mexican pesos was taken from his house, and that of this sum 161 pesos belonged to the municipality,  the remainder being his own property.   It is believed from this that the sum of $65.47, Mexican currency,  alleged to  have been embezzled by him was included in this remainder, and he can not be considered guilty of a crime which  could not have  existed, notwithstanding  the fact that this  money  alleged to have been embezzled does not appear in the  account or receipt books.   Owing to the  informal manner in which the vice-president and the members of the municipal  council proceeded when taking charge of the  books and of the money in the cash box, we can not, in justice, hold that there was any misappropriation by the defendant of funds belonging to the municipality, since it appears that he had belonging to himself in the cash  box, which was taken  from him, a larger sum of money than that alleged to have been misappropriated.</p>
<p>The municipal president himself testifies that the accused, owing to his ignorance or unfamiliarity with bookkeeping methods, was accustomed to  avail himself of the president's assistance when entering his receipts in his cash book, and from this it may well be inferred  that if the  sum of money supposed to have been  embezzled  does not  appear on the book, this omission is chargeable to the municipal president.</p>
<p>In the absence of evidence to the contrary, we must give credence  to the  statement  of  the defendant that he had in the municipal cash box money of his own exceeding the amount alleged to have been embezzled.  A sum of money, uncounted, was taken from his house, and the amount of this money is unknown at  the present time.  The  record does not disclose what sum was seized by the vice-president and the members of the municipal council who  removed the  defendant from office.  We therefore can not  regard the  accused as guilty of appropriating a  sum of  money much inferior in amount to the funds  in his hands at the time he ceased to hold office.</p>
<p>For these reasons we are of the opinion that the judgment below should be reversed and the defendant acquitted, with the costs <em>de oficio</em>.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em> Arellano, C. J., Cooper, Willard,</em> and <em>Mapa, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><strong>MCDONOUGH, J.,</strong> dissenting  :</p>
<p>I dissent.  I think that the facts found are sufficient to justify the conviction and that the judgment below should be affirmed.<br>
