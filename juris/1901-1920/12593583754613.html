				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> The judgment in this case must be affirmed.  It is clearly proved by  the testimony  of Felix Labayan, Casiana Capilar, and  Timoteo Unson that part of the crop of 1899 was not delivered by the defendant  to the plaintiff in accordance with the terms of the agreement between them.   The provisions  of article 1575 of  the Civil Code can not be so applied as  to excuse this failure.  That article does not refer to  a  contract  in  which the stipulated rent is an aliquot part of the crop, for example, one-fourth, as it was in this case. This failure to deliver a part, of the crop was a failure to pay the rent, and therefore gave to the plaintiff the right to eject the defendant  under the terms of article 1569, section 2.  This action was brought for that purpose and for that alone.  It was in no sense  a personal action to recover  the  value of that part of the crop which  had not been delivered.</p>
<p> The fact that this  suit  was brought  before  the termination of the crop of 1899-1900  is not important.  It was not brought until after  a failure  by the defendant to deliver part of the crop  at the  time  specified in the  contract.  The defendant's alleged counterclaim was properly rejected  for the reasons stated in the opinion of the trial court.</p>
<p> As to the suggestion made in the argument that the defendant had already abandoned the land, it is enough to say that such fact does not appear in any way from the record. On the contrary it appears that the appeal to the Superior Court of Negros was allowed in both effects.</p>
<p> The judgment  is affirmed with  costs against the appellant.</p>
<p> <em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Cooper, Smith, Mapa,</em> and <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em>concur.</p>
