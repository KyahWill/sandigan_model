				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This action was commenced in the Court of First Instance of the Province of 
Bulacan on the 31st day of January, 1911. Its purpose was to recover the 
possession, as owner, of a certain piece or parcel of land particularly 
described in paragraph 2 of the complaint, together with damages for the use and 
occupation of the same.
<p>It appears from the answer of the defendants that sometime prior to the 
commencement of the present action, the defendants had obtained possession of 
the land in question by virtue of a judgment rendered by a justice of the peace 
in an action of <em>desahucio</em>, which was, on an appeal to the Court of 
First Instance, revoked.</p>
<p>After a careful consideration of the evidence adduced during the trial of the 
case by both the plaintiffs and the defendants, the Honorable Simplicio del 
Rosario reached the conclusion that a large preponderance of the evidence showed 
that the plaintiffs were the owners of the parcel of land in question, and 
ordered the defendants to deliver the possession of the same to them. The lower 
court further found that there was no evidence sufficient to justify a judgment 
for damages in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendants for the use 
and occupation of the land.</p>
<p>From that judgment the defendants appealed to this court.</p>
<p>The only assignment of error made by the appellants is that the lower court 
erred in rendering a judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and against the 
defendants. The only argument adduced by the appellants in support of said 
assignment of error is that the judgment of the said justice of the peace giving 
them the possession of the land was <em>res adjudicata</em> and therefore final 
in their favor. The answer to that argument is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(<em>a</em>) That the judgment of the justice of the peace giving them the 
possession of the land in question was, according to their own admission in the 
answer, reversed on an appeal to the Court of First Instance; and 
furthermore</p>
<p>(<em>b</em>) That the judgment of a justice of the peace in an action of 
<em>desahucio</em> is not <em>res adjudicata</em> in a subsequent action between 
the same parties to determine the title to the property. (Ty Laco Cioco 
<em>vs</em>. Muro, 9 Phil. Rep., 100; Roman Catholic Church <em>vs</em>. 
Familiar, 11 Phil. Rep., 310; Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila <em>vs</em>. 
Municipality of Rosario, 14 Phil. Rep., 176.)</p></blockquote>
<p>In an action of <em>desahucio</em> the right of possession is the only 
question involved. In an action to recover land as owner the question of title 
and ownership is the only question involved. There are cases where the ownership 
may be in one person and the right to possession in another. For example, the 
tenant is entitled to the possession of the land as against his landlord, and 
might recover the same in an action of <em>desahucio</em>, while the landlord, 
thereafter, might recover the title to the land in an action brought for that 
purpose. In the latter action the tenant would not be permitted to plead the 
action of <em>desahucio</em> as <em>res adjudicata</em> against such action.</p>
<p>After a consideration of the facts and the law applicable thereto, we are of 
the opinion, and so hold, that the judgment of the lower court should be, and is 
hereby, affirmed, with costs. So ordered.</p><em>Arellano, C. J., Araullo, 
Street</em>, and <em>Malcolm, JJ.</em>, concur. <br><br><br>
<hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1">

<p>CARSON, J., concurring:</p>
<p>Understanding as I do, that the general doctrine touching <em>res 
adjudicata</em> announced in the principal decision, is not in conflict with the 
doctrine announced in Pe√±alosa <em>vs</em>. Tuason (22 Phil. Rep., 303), wherein 
we distinguished between the effect of judgments in summary actions of 
ejectment, as <em>res adjudicata</em> and their effect as an estoppel as to 
those matters in issue or points controverted upon the determination of which 
the finding or judgment was rendered, I concur.</p></div>
