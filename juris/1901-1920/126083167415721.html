				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>From the record in this case it appears that some time on or about the    day of    , the plaintiff commenced an action  in the Court of First  Instance of the Province of Romblon against the defendant,  asking for the following remedy:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"First. The partition of all the property  which appears in the inventory, made up and subscribed by the defendant herself, between  the plaintiff and the defendant.</p>
  <p>"Second. That an accounting be rendered by the defendant with regard  to the other property existing, or which has existed, in her possession belonging exclusively to the married couple Maximo Madrilejos and Agustina Rutor, and which does not appear in the inventory made up and signed by the aforesaid Anacleta Madrilejos.</p>
  <p>"Third. An equitable indemnity for damages suffered on account of the retention of said property, inasmuch as the same had been  claimed several  times, the  computation thereof to be made from the date  of the first claim.</p>
  <p>"Fourth.  Such costs as may accrue in the present proceedings."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To this complaint the defendant filed an answer,  after having presented a demurrer, which contained a general and special denial and prayed for affirmative relief against the plaintiff.</p>
<p>After hearing all of. the parties and the evidence which was adduced during the trial of the cause, the lower court rendered a decision in which the  following appears as the dispositive part:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Reserving to  the plaintiff all  the lawful rights to demand from  Anacleta an accounting for the whole of the property  belonging to the copartnership  that went into her possession, and  the payment of Maximo's share,  by due process of law and in. due course, this action should, in my opinion, be dismissed, and  the defendant, Anacleta, is entitled to recover costs.  Such  portion of the costs which accrued prior to the administrator becoming a party to the suit should be recovered from Feliciano Rutor, and such costs as accrued after Chanco, the administrator, was a party to the suit should be recovered from  him as the administrator of  the  estate of Maximo; therefore, judgment is entered  in accordance with the foregoing.   Let the complaint  be dismissed without prejudice, with the costs against the  defendant as stated above."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this decision of  the lower court the plaintiff appealed to  the Supreme Court, the result of which appeal appears recorded in Volume V, Philippine Reports, page 319, in which the court held (p. 323):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The judgment  appealed from should be reversed and the cause sent back to the trial court, wherein judgment will be rendered in accordance herewith, and such necessary orders entered as may be proper to secure an accounting and distribution of the property under administration, as prayed in  the complaint, together with such other relief as may be just and proper."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cause was duly returned to the  lower court.  On the 25th (23d)  day of April,  1903, and before the first appeal was brought Jo this court, the Hon. Henry C. Bates, judge  of said court, made the following order:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The defendant is hereby ordered to deliver to this court as soon as possible all and every one of  the documents, books, and papers of any kind proving the ownership and possession  of all the property left at the time of their deatli  by Maximo Madrilejos or Agustina Rutor."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To this order the defendant made the following answer:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"At  Romblon, on the 27th day of April, 1903,  Anacleta Madrilejos, having been duly summoned, appeared before me, the clerk of this court, and  I then informed her of the foregoing order  of the judge,  and in answer thereto she stated  that she was not in possession of documents of any kind in  connection  with  the  property  left  by  the late Maximo Madrilejos and  Agustina Rutor, because, after the first inventory of said property was made, and upon agreement to divide the same in three parts, and by reason of the confidence which the respondent had in the family of the plaintiff,  Peliciano Rutor, who  lived in the  house of the said deceased,  they being at  the time upon friendly terms,  the trunk that contained the documents remained in said house, and the respondent only  took  with  her to her own house the trunk which contained the clothes of her late brother, Maximo, and said trunk was taken away from her by Jose M. Caballero and his friends when they made a new inventory.  This is what she deposed and in proof   whereof she signed the same  in my  presence. (Signed) Anacleta Madrilejos.   (Signed)  Bonifacio Madrilejos, deputy clerk."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the 16th day of August, 1906, after the return of the record from this court in the original appeal, the attorney for the plaintiff presented  a motion in the lower court asking that the judgment of the Supreme Court he  executed.  On the 17th day of August, 1906, the Hon. Jose C. Abreu, then judge of said judicial district, made the following order:</p>
<p>"It is ordered that the said defendant, Anacleta Madrilejos, forthwith deliver to the said administrator, Alfredo Chanco, all the property held by her appertaining exclusively to the married couple Maximo Madrilejos and Agustina Butor, and that the said defendant appear before this court on  the 24th day of August,  1906, at 8 a. in.,  and render an accounting concerning the whole of said property"</p>
<p>On the  same day the said Hon. Jose C. Abreu  made the following order, based upon the order of the 23d day of April, 1903, by the Hon, Henry 0. Bates, then judge of that court:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"<em>Order of the cour</em>t.—In view of the motion filed by the plaintiff asking that the defendant be summoned to appear in this court and show cause, if any, why she should not be convicted  for contempt, for not having  delivered to the clerk  of this court the books, documents,  and papers pertaining to the said estate in accordance with the order issued by the judge, Hon. Henry C. Bates, under date of the 23d of April, 1903;</p>
  <p>"It is ordered that the said defendant, Anacleta Madrilejos, appear in this court on the 20th day of August, 1906, at 8 a. m., to show cause, if any, why she should not be convicted  of contempt  for not having complied with said order of  the  Hon. Judge  Bates, dated April  23, 1906 (1903)."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the 20th day of August, 1906j the defendant appeared and made the following answer to the order of the court:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"<em>Affidavit</em>—Now  comes the  defendant in  compliance with the order of this  court dated August 17, 1906,  and respectfully sets forth:</p>
  <p>"1.  That she has not in  her possession nor holds  any kind of books,  documents, or papers  pertaining to  the estate of the late Maximo Madrilejos and Agustina Rutor.</p>
  <p>"2. That she did not have in her possession prior to said Mate such books, documents, or papers belonging to said estate;  because the trunk that contained them has always been in  the house of the deceased Madrilejos-Rutor wherein lived Eugenia and Pedro Rutor, the children of Feliciano Rutor, brother to  the late Agustina Rutor, the family of Feliciano Rutor having the custody of the said trunk.</p>
  <p>"And that for the above reasons the respondent believes that she can not be held liable for  contempt for not complying with the subpoena <em>duces tecum</em> issued by  this  court in the proceedings in civil action No. 14.</p>
  <p>"In witness whereof, these presents  are  sworn to and signed in Romblon, on August 20,  1906.</p>
  <p align="right">(Signed)   "ANACLETA MADRILEJOS."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the filing of this said answer on the part of the defendant, and on the same day, the attorney for the plaintiff, C. W. Ney, filed a  complaint against the defendant in said cause, accusing her of the offense of contempt of court, in which complaint the said attorney  stated:</p>
<p>First.  That he is attorney for the plaintiff in said cause.</p>
<p>Second. That  the  defendant, Anacleta Madrilejos, has in her possession  various  books, documents, and papers belonging to the above-mentioned estate.</p>
<p>Third. That on  the  23d day of April, 1903,  the  court ordered the said defendant  to immediately deliver to  the plaintiff all said documents, books, and papers.<br>
  Fourth. That  the said defendant  had  not complied with the said order and falsely denied that she had any of  the said books, documents, or papers to deliver and  requested that the court proceed  against the said defendant for contempt.</p>
<p>Upon this complaint, the lower court, on the same day, ordered the said defendant to appear before the court on the 24th day of  August, 1906, at 8 o'clock a. m., to  show why she should not be proceeded against for said offense. On the  day named in said order, to wit, the 24th day of August, 1906, at 8 o'clock a. m., the defendant appeared before the said judge and made the statement that she did not have in her possession  any of the property  of said estate and that therefore she could  not render an accounting concerning the same; whereupon the said attorney, C. W. Ney, presented another complaint against the defendant, asking that she  be proceeded against for her failure to comply with the above order of the 17th day of August, 1906, and on the same day the Hon. Jose C. Abreu ordered the defendant to appear immediately before him and show why she should not be punished for  contempt.</p>
<p>These two complaints were duly heard by the lower court, each party  presenting proof.  After hearing the evidence adduced by the respective parties, the court upon the 29th  day of August rendered  a decision upon each complaint, under the provisions of section 232 of the Code of Civil Procedure, ordering that the defendant be detained in prison until  she was willing to  comply with the two orders of the court, the first made  by the Hon.  Henry C. Bates, dated the 23d of April, 1903,  and the other made by the Hon. Jose C. Abreu on the 17th  of August,  1906. From  these decisions of the .lower court the' defendant appealed to this court and  the question presented is, Was the defendant guilty of the offense of <em>desacato</em> (contempt) in view of all the facts presented in the  record?</p>
<p>Section 232 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"A person guilty of any of the following acts may be punished as for contempt:</p>
  <p>"(1)  Disobedience of  or resistance to a lawful  writ, process, order, judgment, or command  of a court, or injunction granted by a court or judge."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be noted that this section  contains the provision that the disobedience or resistance  must be to  a  lawful order; in other words, the order must be in accordance with law.  The court has  no  authority  to punish  for  disobedience or  resistance of an order  which was made without authority.   (People <em>vs</em>. O'Neil,  47  Cal.,  109;  Ex  Parte William Hollis, 59 Cal., 405; Brown <em>vs</em>. Moore, 61  Cal., 432; Ex Parte W. A, Brown, 97 Cal., 83.)</p>
<p>It will be remembered that the original  action in this case was an ordinary  action by  the plaintiff as administrator against the defendant, and therefore the  procedure applicable thereto is the procedure marked out by the code in ordinary actions.  The proceedings were not  in accordance with  section 709 and section 710 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions.  If the plaintiff  desired to obtain possession of  documents which  were supposed to be  in the possession of the defendant, it was his duty to proceed by the proper form of subpoena and  not by the method followed in this particular case.</p>
<p>We are of the opinion, and so hold, that there is no justification in law, under the form of action which the plaintiff brought against the defendant, to sustain the orders which the lower  court made  and for the violation of which the defendant  was punished for contempt, and therefore the orders of the lower  court in both of the contempt proceedings, ordering that the defendant be confined in prison until such orders should  be  complied with, are hereby revoked, and, without any finding as to costs, it is so ordered.</p>
