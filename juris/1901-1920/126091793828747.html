				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This was an action by the  plaintiff  to recover  of the defendant the sum of $1,590.48, Mexican, for groceries sold to the defendant at his  request.</p>
<p>The complaint contains three different causes of action. The first is to recover the sum of $178.42,  Mexican, on an open account, the second for  the sum of $919.40, Mexican on a  promissory note,  and the third to recover the sum of $492.66, Mexican, also on a promissory note.</p>
<p>The evidence adduced during the trial  shows  that the open account as  well  as the  two promissory  notes represented an  indebtedness for groceries sold to the defendant at his special instance and request.</p>
<p>The defendant  filed a general denial to the first cause of action and demurred to the second and third causes of action.   The ground of the demurrer to the second and third causes of action was based upon the fact that they were incomplete and insufficient, because each did not set forth all of the facts constituting the particular cause of action. The first paragraph of the second cause of action (and the first  paragraph of the third cause of action is  the same) states:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The plaintiff refers to the first and second paragraphs of the first cause of action as a part thereof the  same as if said  paragraphs were specifically  set  forth herein."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The defendant bases his objection upon section 90 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions.  Said section 90 defines a complaint and indicates in a general way what it should contain.</p>
<p>Paragraph 2 of said section provides among other things :</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"If a complaint contains more than one cause of action, each distinct cause of action must be set forth in  a separate paragraph, containing all of the facts constituting the particular cause of  action."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No rule of pleading is better settled than that each cause of action must contain all of the essential facts necessary to constitute  a cause of action, but where a  complaint contains two  or more causes of action,  allegations  contained in one cause may be  incorporated in the other by express reference without the necessity of rewriting  the same in the second cause.  That is what  the plaintiff  did here.   When the plaintiff in the second and third causes of action referred in  the first paragraphs of the same to paragraphs 1 and 2 of the first cause of action  and made said paragraphs a part of said second and third causes of action, it was the same  as if he had rewritten said paragraphs 1 and 2 into the second and third  causes of action.</p>
<p>The defendant attempted to show that  the said  promissory notes had not been executed by him; that they had been signed by the hotel  "The Drexel," by J. E. Sweeney, manager.  The evidence adduced during the  trial shows that J. E. Sweeney was the manager of the said  hotel, but that the defendant was the  owner  of the said hotel business;  that the groceries were sold to the  defendant; that the said promissory  notes were actually drawn  by the said J. E. Sweeney and signed by him as manager of the said hotel business at the special instance and direction of the defendant.</p>
<p>After hearing the evidence, the  inferior court rendered a judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant for the amount of the claim set forth in the several causes of action.  After the rendition of said judgment, the attorney for the defendant requested the lower court to make a finding  of facts upon which said judgment was based, in accordance with section 133 of the Code of Procedure  in Civil Actions.  The inferior court made the following finding of facts in accordance with said request:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="center">"I.</p>
  <p>"The court finds the plaintiff, Lo Sui,  is the owner and proprietor  of the  Philippine Grocery Store, and that a final  judgment in this case will  protect the defendants against a recovery by the Philippine  Grocery Company, or its assigns, on this same cause of  action.</p>
  <p align="center">"II.</p>
  <p>"The court finds that J. E. Sweeney was the manager of the Hotel Drexel  for the defendant Wyatt and was his, Wyatt's,  authorized agent.</p>
  <p align="center">"III.</p>
  <p>"The court finds that the defendant, Wyatt, was present at the Hotel Drexel when the plaintiff and his bookkeeper were there to collect the amount of said notes from the defendant Wyatt, which  were there on account, and that said Sweeney was directed by defendant, Wyatt, to execute the notes sued on in this  case in the form, and signed them, as they appear, and that he, Wyatt,  made and signed the endorsement on the back thereof, as  appears  thereon and that he is, in fact, the maker of said  notes.</p>
  <p align="center">"IV</p>
  <p>"The court finds that  the payment  of said notes was demanded of  defendant, Wyatt, after maturity.</p>
  <p>"The court finds that it is clear from the proof in this case that the defendant had bought groceries from plaintiff from time to time up to the  20th of June, 1904, for which said two notes 'A'  and 'B were executed,  after which time  he purchased  groceries of plaintiff to  the amount of P502.43, Philippine currency, upon which account  defendant, Wyatt, paid plaintiff 324  pesos, leaving a balance due on account of 178.42 pesos, which balance of account, together with the two notes, 'Exhibits A and B' the complaint alleges to be due plaintiff and which the court found to be true and rendered judgment accordingly.</p>
  <p>"Defendant's counsel  on  behalf of his client seems to have  placed  stress on  the  language used in the second paragraph of the complaint, to wit:</p>
  <p>" 'For a part of said above described indebtedness.'</p>
  <p>"It  is not clear to  the court why this language  was inserted  nor  does the  court think it material.  If it has no place, it  can  be  treated as surplusage.  Under  the pleadings and proof in this case the rights of the parties are clear.</p>

<p>The evidence adduced during  the trial  justifies  this finding of facts.</p>
<p>The amount claimed by the  plaintiff in the three, different  causes of action  amounts  to $1,590.48,  Mexican, which  reduced to Philippine currency at the rate of $1.10, Mexican, for 1% Philippine currency, equals the sum of Pl,445.89,  Philippine  currency, for which  judgment is hereby rendered  against the defendant  in  favor of the plaintiff, with the costs in both  instances.</p>
<p>After the expiration of ten  days it is hereby ordered that judgment be rendered against the defendant and in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of P1,445.89, Philippine currency, with interest at the rate of 6 per cent from the 19th of July,  1904, with the costs in both instances.</p>
