RaÃ±ola, with the privilege&nbsp; of levying upon all or any of the realties comprised within&nbsp; the mortgage mentioned&nbsp; in the said instrument; that the amount credited for the expenses referred to in No. 7 of&nbsp; the fifth paragraph of this cause of action reached&nbsp; P174.95; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant,&nbsp; availing himself of the credit granted in the aforementioned instrument of December 21, 1906, took&nbsp; and withdrew from the plaintiff's warehouses,&nbsp; on different dates between&nbsp; the 20th of November and the 19th of December, 1906,&nbsp; inclusive, various quantities&nbsp; of&nbsp; flour,&nbsp; the total value of&nbsp; which amounted to P5,588.15; that the defendant had&nbsp; not paid any&nbsp; part&nbsp; of this amount,&nbsp; except the sum&nbsp; of P375, and was owing a balance of P5,213.15; that at the time of the complaint the said defendant owed the plaintiff the sums&nbsp; of P174.95 and P5,213.15,&nbsp; in addition to P503.79 as interest due up to the date of the complaint; that&nbsp; the plaintiff was then the legal owner of the mortgage above referred to, and that&nbsp; none of the sums mentioned nor any part thereof had been paid to him:&nbsp; wherefore the plaintiff asked that judgment&nbsp; be&nbsp; rendered in&nbsp; his favor against the defendant,&nbsp; for the following amounts: (1) For&nbsp; the sum&nbsp; of&nbsp; P3,302.50,&nbsp; the principal demanded in the first cause of action, and interest thereon at 8 per cent per annum from date until its payment;&nbsp; (2) for the sum of P385.57, as interest&nbsp; due on the principal mentioned in the preceding&nbsp; paragraph&nbsp; and remaining&nbsp; unpaid,&nbsp; and,&nbsp; in addition, the interest on this sum at the rate of 6 per&nbsp; cent per annum from the&nbsp; date&nbsp; of the complaint until paid; (3) for the sum of P5,213.15, the amount of the debt&nbsp; claimed in the second cause of action, together with the&nbsp; interest thereon at the rate of 8 per cent per annum&nbsp; from date until its payment; (4) for the sum of P503.79, the interest due on the principal mentioned in the preceding paragraph, with interest thereon at&nbsp; 6 per cent&nbsp; per annum from date until payment; (5) for the sum of P174.95, claimed in paragraph 9 of the&nbsp; second cause of action, with&nbsp; interest thereon&nbsp; at 6 per cent&nbsp; per annum from the&nbsp; date of the complaint until payment; and, (6)&nbsp; for the sum of P1,000 for&nbsp; costs&nbsp; and attorney's fees.</li></ol>The plaintiff&nbsp; further&nbsp; prayed that an&nbsp; order&nbsp; be&nbsp; issued directing the delivery to the plaintiff&nbsp; of the properties described in the complaint, in order that he might&nbsp; administer them&nbsp; during the&nbsp; course of this suit and until they should ultimately be sold, and authorizing him to collect and receive the revenues, rentals, fruits, and other products&nbsp; of the said estates and to retain them in&nbsp; his possession in order to satisfy the judgment that would be rendered in this case, and that in case the said judgment be not satisfied thereby, the sale of the said properties be ordered and the proceeds thereof be applied to the purpose.<br><br>The defendant, in his answer,&nbsp; made a general and specific denial of each and all of the allegations of the plaintiff for each and all&nbsp; of the actions instituted&nbsp; by him in each and all of&nbsp; the paragraphs of the complaint,&nbsp; and as a special defense, and in his crosscomplaint, alleged:&nbsp; That the defendant did not execute, consent to, nor authorize the execution of a power of attorney&nbsp; of any kind whatsoever in favor of Vicente Marcelo Concepcion, empowering the latter to mortgage, pledge, or&nbsp; otherwise&nbsp; dispose of, to the plaintiff or to any person whatever, any of the properties mentioned in the complaint, nor to accept from and open with&nbsp; the plaintiff any&nbsp; credit&nbsp; nor establish with&nbsp; him any business in flour; nor execute&nbsp; any&nbsp; power&nbsp; of attorney nor&nbsp; grant any authority whatever&nbsp; in favor of the said Concepcion so that the latter might represent him and&nbsp; accept in his name credit, or moneys whatsoever from any person; nor dispose of, mortgage, or encumber any of the&nbsp; properties described in the complaint;&nbsp; that&nbsp; the defendant received&nbsp; no&nbsp; sum whatever&nbsp; from&nbsp; the plaintiff nor was he in the&nbsp; latter's debt for the amount claimed in&nbsp; the complaint, nor for any other sum of money; that he did not give his consent to all or to any one of the mortgages alleged in the&nbsp; complaint, and that all&nbsp; the said mortgages on the properties therein mentioned were founded on a supposed power of attorney said&nbsp; to have been executed by&nbsp; the defendant in favor&nbsp; of Vicente Marcelo Concepcion, which power&nbsp; of attorney was fictitious, false, fraudulent, null and void,&nbsp; that it was not executed by the defendant, nor did the latter intervene there in and that the said power of attorney had no true reason for existence; wherefore the&nbsp; defendant asked that judgment be rendered absolving&nbsp; him from the complaint with the costs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; against the plaintiff, by annulling each and all of the mortgages alleged in the complaint and the inscription of each of them in the office of the register of property of Tayabas, and by ordering the cancellation of all the inscriptions of the said mortgages and encumbrances on the aforementioned properties.<br><br>The plaintiff, in answer to the countercomplaint, set up a general and specific denial of each and all of the allegations of the defendant with respect to each and all of the actions brought by&nbsp; him in each and&nbsp; all&nbsp; of the paragraphs of the countercomplaint, and prayed that judgment be pronounced in his favor,&nbsp; and against the defendant, in conformity with the petitions made in his complaint.<br><br>The case&nbsp; came up for hearing on November 30, 1908, and after the presentation of oral evidence by both parties, the documentary evidence&nbsp; being attached to&nbsp; the record, the court, on December 15 of the&nbsp; same year, rendered judgment whereby it&nbsp; directed that the&nbsp; plaintiff should recover from the defendant the sum specified in the first instrument of mortgage, P3,302.50, as principal,&nbsp; the additional sum of P385.57 as interest up to April 30, 1908, besides the interest on the said principal, at the rate of 8 per cent&nbsp; per annum from the date just above mentioned until its&nbsp; complete payment, also the P500 stipulated in&nbsp; the said instrument as payable by the defendant as costs and expenses in case of litigation; and the sum mentioned in the second&nbsp; instrument of mortgage,&nbsp; P5,213.15&nbsp; as&nbsp; principal, besides P503.79,&nbsp; as interest up to the 30th day of April, 1908, in addition to the interest on the said principal&nbsp; at the rate&nbsp; of 8 per cent per annum, from the&nbsp; date just above mentioned&nbsp; until its complete payment, and the sum of P174.95, as expenses for the execution of the instrument, for its inscription, cancellation, and acquittance, as provided&nbsp; for in clause 17 of the said instrument, and the additional sum of P600, which&nbsp; it was stipulated in the&nbsp; second instrument the&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; should pay for costs and expenses in case of litigation.&nbsp; The judgment further ordered&nbsp; that&nbsp; the defendant should pay the several&nbsp; amounts above mentioned, with&nbsp; the&nbsp; intei'est and costs, on or before the first day of the sitting of the court in April,&nbsp; 1909, and that, in case such order should not be complied&nbsp; with, the mortgages should be foreclosed and a final writ should be issued directing that all the properties before described be sold, the proceeds of the sale to pay the principal, interest, and costs.&nbsp; The defendant, when notified of this judgment, took exception thereto,&nbsp; announced that he would file a bill of exceptions, and moved for a new trial on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to warrant the judgment rendered and that the latter was contrary to law.&nbsp; This motion was denied and exception was taken&nbsp; by the appellant, who filed the proper bill of exceptions, which was certified&nbsp; to,&nbsp; approved, and forwarded&nbsp; to the clerk of this court.&nbsp; By an order of March 1, 1909,&nbsp; it was provided that the execution of the aforesaid judgment should not be suspended pending the appeal, unless the defendant, for the reasons stated in the said order, should give a&nbsp; bond for P10,000.<br><br>The purpose of the suit filed by the plaintiff, W. W. Robinson, is the collection of various sums owed by the defendant, Marcelino Villafuerte y RaÃ±ola,&nbsp; the&nbsp; payment of which is secured by a mortgage on the real properties set out in the two notarial documents evidencing the debt,&nbsp; exhibited under letters A and B,&nbsp; and inscribed in the&nbsp; property&nbsp; registry of the Province of Tayabas.<br><br>The mortgage action brought by the creditor, based upon the two aforementioned notarial documents&nbsp; is proper, inasmuch as it is sought to collect certain sums&nbsp; specified in the said instruments&nbsp; on account of their not having been&nbsp; paid within the periods therein&nbsp; stipulated, and consequently the real properties offered as security for the solvency of the debts&nbsp; contracted by the debtor are duly liable for the satisfaction of the same;&nbsp; and although the credit of P3,852.50, the value&nbsp; of the&nbsp; flour furnished to Camilo C.&nbsp; Gomez,&nbsp; in account with the&nbsp; defendant, and referred to in the instrument lettered A, was to have been paid in four installments from&nbsp; October 19, 1906, at the rate of Pl,000 in&nbsp; each one of the three first months and P852.50 in the fourth and last month, yet since the debtor, notwithstanding, the demands made upon him, did not comply with his obligation nor pay his debt in conformity with the tenor of the said instrument, letter&nbsp; A, for he only paid the creditor&nbsp; the sum&nbsp; of P550 delivered partially on different dates, the default of payment of any of the installments agreed upon produces the effect that all of these must be deemed to have matured&nbsp; and entitles&nbsp; the creditor to demand the payment of his entire credit and&nbsp; to proceed against the mortgaged properties for the purpose of collecting his credit, which&nbsp; amounts to P3,302.50, after&nbsp; the deduction of the said&nbsp; P550 from the principal, with the interest due from the 6th of December, 1906, amounting to P385.57.<br><br>With respect to the credit mentioned in the&nbsp; instrument, Exhibit&nbsp; B, and granted by the plaintiff to the defendant Villafuerte under agreement&nbsp; that&nbsp; the latter should make use of the said credit by&nbsp; taking flour from the creditor's warehouse by means of written duebills or orders signed by the debtor, or his attorney in fact,&nbsp; under condition that the value or amount&nbsp; of the&nbsp; said duebills&nbsp; should&nbsp; be&nbsp; paid within thirty days from their date and that these acknowledgments of debt should bear interest of 8 per&nbsp; cent&nbsp; per annum from the date of their maturity, it was also a condition that the aforesaid instrument should be deemed to be retroactive in its effect, from November 20, 1906, that the quantities of flour&nbsp; which&nbsp; were taken from the plaintiff's warehouse since&nbsp; the said&nbsp; November&nbsp; 20, 1906, should&nbsp; be considered as included, and that the total amount of whatever the defendant&nbsp; might owe,&nbsp; by reason of the credit mentioned, together with the interest thereon, should be settled and entirely paid on May&nbsp; 20, 1907, on which date all&nbsp; the orders or duebills issued against the said credit should be deemed to have matured, even&nbsp; though the thirty&nbsp; days' delay stipulated should not have expired.<br><br>In view of the fact that the defendant succeeded in withdrawing flour to the value of P5,078.15, without his having paid the amount due therefor, except P375, it can not be denied that there still remains&nbsp; a balance to&nbsp; be&nbsp; paid of P4,703.15 (pp. 5 and 88 of the record).<br><br>In the account, Exhibit E, there appears a statement of the sacks of flour which were taken on account of&nbsp; the said credit&nbsp; by means of&nbsp; the nine duebills,&nbsp; Exhibit F, attached to the aforementioned account, in which it also appears that the value of the said sacks of flour was P4,703.15, after the deduction of P375.<br><br>The complaint which gave rise to the present suit is in accordance with the provisions of section 255&nbsp; of the Code of Civil&nbsp; Procedure,&nbsp; and the mortgages&nbsp; constituted in&nbsp; the two&nbsp; instruments aforementioned fulfill the conditions&nbsp; and requirements&nbsp; prescribed in articles 1857,&nbsp; 1874, and 1875 of the Civil Code;&nbsp; wherefore judgment should be rendered favorable to the mortgage creditor, in&nbsp; accordance with&nbsp; section&nbsp; 256, and&nbsp; following, of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br><br>The defendant debtor denied the existence of the obligations contained in the said instruments; he asserted&nbsp; that the latter, and the&nbsp; powers of&nbsp; attorney executed&nbsp; in favor of Vicente Marcelo Concepcion were false, and likewise denied that he owed&nbsp; the plaintiff any of the amounts claimed in the complaint, or that he had authorized the said Concepcion to mortgage&nbsp; the realties&nbsp; described in the said complaint, and&nbsp; in asking for his release, he prayed that the aforementioned&nbsp; mortgages and the inscriptions of the&nbsp; same in the property registry be declared null and void.<br><br>If it is true, as it appears to be, that the defendant Marcelino Villafuerte y RaÃ±ola executed, on July 11 and&nbsp; October 29,&nbsp; 1906, in this city,&nbsp; the powers of attorney,&nbsp; Exhibits C and D, in favor&nbsp; of Vicente Marcelo Concepcion, before&nbsp; the notaries&nbsp; Eugenio de&nbsp; Lara and Daniel&nbsp; R, Williams, respectively, it not having been proved at trial that the said powers of attorney were false or null and void, the mortgages upon the real properties, executed by the attorney in fact, duly authorized for the purpose, in the instruments designated under&nbsp; letters&nbsp; A and B,&nbsp; the first of them&nbsp; ratified in&nbsp; the notarial&nbsp; record,&nbsp; letter&nbsp; G, by the&nbsp; debtor before the same notary, Williams,&nbsp; must be accepted as valid and in&nbsp; force, inasmuch as the said mortgage deeds&nbsp; appear to&nbsp; have been ratified in due form by the contracting or interested parties before the said notary in Manila, it not having been proven at trial that they contained any flaw or defect which&nbsp; might operate to annul them.<br><br>The evidence adduced by the defendant in his attempt to prove&nbsp; that,&nbsp; on the two dates before mentioned, when the said two powers&nbsp; of attorney appear to have&nbsp; been executed,&nbsp; he was in Lucena, Tayabas, and not in this city of Manila, has not resulted in defeating&nbsp; the validity, authenticity,&nbsp; and force of the&nbsp; said powers&nbsp; of&nbsp; attorney, for the truth of their contents as&nbsp; well as their ratification by the person executing them was certified to by the notaries before whom&nbsp; they&nbsp; were exhibited respectively in the presence of two witnesses; the oral testimony presented by the defendant was insufficient to prove that the notaries Lara and Williams&nbsp; untruthfully certified that Marcelino Villafuerte, whom&nbsp; they attested&nbsp; under oath that they knew,&nbsp; personally appeared before&nbsp; them&nbsp; and&nbsp; ratified&nbsp; in its&nbsp; totality&nbsp; the contents of the aforementioned document, declaring that he ha.d executed it&nbsp; freely and voluntarily&nbsp; and exhibited for the purpose his&nbsp; cedula, No. 453963, issued in Lucena, Tayabas,&nbsp; on January 15, 1906.<br><br>In order to establish the conclusion, as the logical&nbsp; result of the evidence,&nbsp; that the&nbsp; said two notaries,&nbsp; falsely, and entirely&nbsp; irrespective of&nbsp; the&nbsp; truth,&nbsp; issued&nbsp; the certificates which&nbsp; appear under&nbsp; their respective signatures and seals at the foot of the powers of attorney, letters&nbsp; C and D, it&nbsp; is not sufficient to prove, by means of the testimony of witnesses, (mostly relatives) and by&nbsp; unauthenticated documents, that on the dates of the&nbsp; execution of the powers of attorney the person executing them was not&nbsp; here&nbsp; in Manila, where the instruments were certified to, but&nbsp; in Lucena, Tayabas; clear,&nbsp; strong, and&nbsp; irrefutable proof must&nbsp; be adduced&nbsp; to prove&nbsp; that the said notaries could not have averred that the said person was actually in their presence,&nbsp; that they heard&nbsp; him ratify the contents of the respective documents, and could not have certified&nbsp; to the number of his cedula, the&nbsp; only&nbsp; one exhibited&nbsp; to&nbsp; both notaries, without having ostensibly perverted the truth.&nbsp; The defendant&nbsp; himself, who averred that he was in Lucena on July 11, 1906, the date of the first power&nbsp; of attorney, said&nbsp; that he&nbsp; was not sure whether on&nbsp; October&nbsp; 29 of the&nbsp; same year,&nbsp; the date of the second, he&nbsp; was in the&nbsp; said pueblo or&nbsp; in this city of Manila.<br><br>Public&nbsp; instruments&nbsp; authenticated by a notary&nbsp; or by a competent public official, with the formalities required&nbsp; by law, are evidence, even against a third person, of&nbsp; the fact which&nbsp; gives rise to their execution and of the date of the latter.&nbsp;&nbsp; They&nbsp; shall also be evidence against the contracting parties and their legal representatives with&nbsp; regard to the declarations the former&nbsp; may have&nbsp; made&nbsp; therein.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Arts. 1216 and&nbsp; 1218, Civil Code.)<br><br><blockquote>"The force&nbsp; of proof of depositions of witnesses&nbsp; shall be weighed&nbsp; by the courts in accordance with the provisions of the law of civil procedure, taking care to avoid that, by the simple coincidence of&nbsp; some depositions, unless their truthfulness be evident,&nbsp; the affairs may be finally&nbsp; decided in which&nbsp; instruments, private documents,&nbsp; or any basis&nbsp; of written evidence are usually made use of."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Art, 1248, Civil Code.)<br></blockquote><br>The&nbsp; defendant debtor&nbsp; having&nbsp; been requested by letter,&nbsp; in the&nbsp; beginning of the year&nbsp; 1907, to pay his debt, were it true that he had not contracted the obligations contained in the&nbsp; instruments lettered A and B, nor executed in favor of Vicente Marcelo the powers of attorney lettered C and D, would have at that time made the proper&nbsp; investigations and taken the necessary&nbsp; steps for the annulment or invalidation&nbsp; of the&nbsp; said instruments.&nbsp; The defendant&nbsp; did not even attempt&nbsp; to do anything of the kind, and we do not find&nbsp; any&nbsp; just reason nor any legal ground whatever&nbsp; to warrant&nbsp; a discussion of the conclusion arrived at by the lower&nbsp; court from his appreciation of the&nbsp; whole&nbsp; of the evidence presented in this suit,<br><br>Were it true that on the dates of the 11th of July and the 29th of October, 1906, the defendant Villafuerte was in Lucena, Tayabas,&nbsp; and not in Manila, it is not understood how two notaries who attested that they&nbsp; personally knew him could have&nbsp; certified that, on&nbsp; the&nbsp; respective dates aforementioned, the&nbsp; said&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; appeared in&nbsp; person before them, ratified&nbsp; the&nbsp; instrument of power of attorney which&nbsp; he had&nbsp; executed,&nbsp; and,&nbsp; to&nbsp; identify his personality, exhibited to the said notaries his certificate of registration, the only one&nbsp; and the&nbsp; same one which he presented at each of his&nbsp; appearances on the said&nbsp; dates.&nbsp; Without proof, nor rational, acceptable explanation, it is impossible to&nbsp; believe that the personal certificate of registration, which identifies a citizen,&nbsp; was for some four months in the&nbsp; possession of another person&nbsp; residing&nbsp; in&nbsp; a distant place.&nbsp; It&nbsp; was not proved in a&nbsp; satisfactory manner at the trial how or why the said cedula, or registration&nbsp; certificate, came to&nbsp; remain for so long a time in the possession&nbsp; of the Chinaman Sy Chuy Chim or of Vicente Marcelo, as averred by the defendant or his counsel, and under this supposition, so strange, anomalous, and&nbsp; out of the ordinary rule that every citizen should necessarily keep his&nbsp; certificate of&nbsp; identification in his possession, no explanation whatever was given&nbsp; by the defendant's counsel as to the purpose for which the defendant parted with his&nbsp; cedula and sent&nbsp; it to either the said Chinaman or Marcelo.&nbsp; The Chinaman was not examined in this litigation and the attorney in&nbsp; fact,&nbsp; Marcelo,&nbsp; denied that he had received the said cedula sent by his constituent. So&nbsp; that for the reasons hereinbefore stated, it'is&nbsp; evident that the defendant Villafuerte personally exhibited the said cedula to the two aforementioned notaries,&nbsp; on his ratification of the respective instrument&nbsp; of power of attorney before each one of them, and it is not permissible&nbsp; to conclude that the instruments of power of attorney executed by&nbsp; the defendant, as well as the&nbsp; certifications subscribed by the notaries Lara and Williams, are false, because of the absolute absence of proof as a foundation for such a charge; for a&nbsp; notarial document, guaranteed&nbsp; by public attestation in accordance with the law, must be&nbsp; sustained in&nbsp; full force and effect so long as he&nbsp; who&nbsp; impugns&nbsp; it shall&nbsp; not&nbsp; have presented&nbsp; strong,&nbsp; complete,&nbsp; and conclusive&nbsp; proof of&nbsp; its falsity or nullity on account of some flaw or defect provided against by law.<br><br>Although&nbsp; the documents&nbsp; exhibited by the defendant's counsel could not, for lack of proof of their authenticity, destroy or impair the value and force of the notarial documents or instruments on which the plaintiff's claim is based, it is, however, to be&nbsp; noted that&nbsp; Pedro Cantero, whose signature appears attached to the papers found on pages 159, 162, and 170, of the record, was not examined either, even for the purpose of&nbsp; identifying&nbsp; his signature, he being a&nbsp; Spaniard and an attorney it is&nbsp; not possible to believe that he wrote the aforementioned documents in the form and style in which they appear to have been&nbsp; drawn&nbsp; up; wherefore, on account of these&nbsp; circumstances, it is reasonable to&nbsp; presume that the documents of pages 159&nbsp; and 170, and the note of&nbsp; page 162, of the record, were not authentic. <br></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">It is also to be observed, in the document or letter found on page 136 of&nbsp; the record, and which also was unauthenticated,&nbsp; that&nbsp; the aforementioned dates of the&nbsp; 11th of July, 1906, appear therein with a correction, made in the proper place, of the figures 11&nbsp; and 6 of the first date, a repetition and details which induce the presumption that the said letter was written on&nbsp; a different date.<br><br>By the foregoing it has been duly&nbsp; shown that the fourth, fifth,&nbsp; sixth,&nbsp; and seventh&nbsp; errors&nbsp; attributed to the judgment&nbsp; are devoid of&nbsp; reason and&nbsp; legal foundation. With respect to the third error alleged we hold that the admission of the documents designated by the letters L and M&nbsp; was proper&nbsp; for the&nbsp; purpose for which they were&nbsp; presented, because that&nbsp; of&nbsp; letter L is&nbsp; an original and one of the triplicates drawn up for a single purpose, as stated therein, and that of letter M&nbsp; is also an original ratified before a notary, in the certificate of which, dated July 13, 1906, there&nbsp; certainly appears an annotation of the same number 453963 of the cedula of the defendant Villafuerte which he exhibited&nbsp; to the notaries who authenticated the powers of attorney, Exhibits C and D.<br><br>With regard to the first two alleged errors, relative to Jose Moreno Lacalle being permitted to address questions to some of the witnesses during the hearing of the case, notwithstanding the&nbsp; presence&nbsp; of Attorney Agustin&nbsp; Alvarez, who represented the plaintiff, it is unquestionable that the intervention of the said law clerk&nbsp; and employee of Messrs. Haussermann, Cohn&nbsp; &amp;&nbsp; Williams,&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff's attorneys in this suit, was improperly admitted; it was not authorized by any law, for the reason that the said&nbsp; Lacalle did not have the capacity and&nbsp; qualifications of a lawyer admitted under oath to practice&nbsp; his profession before the courts of these Islands, and therefore, on&nbsp; objection being made to his presence at the hearing of the case, the .judge should have sustained such objection&nbsp; and&nbsp; should&nbsp; have excluded Lacalle and not permitted him to address questions to the plaintiff's witnesses, notwithstanding the fact that Attorney Agustin&nbsp; Alvarez, designated in&nbsp; substitution&nbsp; of the said Haussermann, Cohn &amp; Williams as the plaintiff's representative in the Court of First Instance of Tayabas, was present. <br></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">Notwithstanding this, the acts performed in the course of some of the proceedings&nbsp; under the&nbsp; direction&nbsp; of Jose Moreno Lacalle are not subject to annulment, as no&nbsp; positive detriment was caused to the defendant, although such intervention is in no&nbsp; manner permitted&nbsp; by the law&nbsp; of procedure.<br><br>However, even&nbsp; though&nbsp; the questions addressed by Lacalle&nbsp; to the plaintiff's&nbsp; witnesses&nbsp; and the presentation&nbsp; of documents&nbsp; of various kinds exhibited at the trial be stricken out for the reason that&nbsp; they&nbsp; were made&nbsp; by a person who was neither a&nbsp; party to the suit nor counsel for the plaintiff, yet we do&nbsp; not find any&nbsp; reason, based upon any&nbsp; positive prohibition of the law, to authorize the striking out of the answers given by&nbsp; the&nbsp; witnesses&nbsp; interrogated by&nbsp; Lacalle, even though the said answers may have been evoked by questions addressed by a person not authorized by law, and there is much less reason for rejecting the cross-questions addressed to the same witnesses by the defendant's attorney, and the answers thereto.<br><br>Although the presentation of the documents which support&nbsp; the claims&nbsp; of the plaintiff party be&nbsp; deemed&nbsp; to&nbsp; be improper, on account of their having been made by a person who nad not the qualifications of a practicing attorney it is nevertheless true&nbsp; that their presentation was authorized by the&nbsp; attorney Alvarez and the documents&nbsp; exhibited continued to be united to&nbsp; the record and were not stricken out therefrom on motion by the other side, but, on the&nbsp; contrary, the attorney for the defendant or his counsel discussed the authenticity and validity of the&nbsp; said documents, made allegations&nbsp; against the same and&nbsp; concluded by&nbsp; asking that these documents,&nbsp; and&nbsp; also the inscription of&nbsp; those designated under letters A&nbsp; and B, be declared null and void.<br><br>From the preceding statements it&nbsp; is concluded that the intervention of Jose Moreno Lacalle in the present suit has in no manner&nbsp; prejudiced the rights and&nbsp; interests&nbsp; of the defendant and that, if judgment was rendered against him and in&nbsp; favor of the plaintiff, it&nbsp; was in consequence of the merits of the evidence adduced by&nbsp; the plaintiff and of the inefficacy and worthlessness of the testimony given by the defendant.<br><br>If the defendant Marcelino&nbsp; Villafuerte&nbsp; had presented substantial,&nbsp; strong and convincing evidence&nbsp; of the&nbsp; falsity of the two&nbsp; powers of attorney executed in favor of Vicente Marcelo Concepcion,&nbsp; the plaintiff's documentary evidence would have been&nbsp; totally&nbsp; invalidated&nbsp; and annulled, and this suit would have had a different ending.<br><br>For the foregoing reasons, it is&nbsp; proper, in our opinion, to affirm the judgment appealed from, as we hereby&nbsp; do, with the costs against the appellant, and in&nbsp; consequence thereof&nbsp; we&nbsp; acquit the plaintiff&nbsp; from&nbsp; the cross complaint relative to the declaration of nullity of the mortgages and inscriptions, as requested by the defendant.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; first day of the term of&nbsp; court&nbsp; immediately following the&nbsp; date on which the fulfilment of this judgment is ordered shall be set for the payment of the amounts due and the foreclosure of the said mortgages.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano, C.
