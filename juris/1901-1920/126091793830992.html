				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Plaintiff and Juan Crisostomo Villamil were married in 1891.  They lived together until 1895,  when Crisostomo abandoned the plaintiff and went to live with the defendant.  On the 7th of September, 1896, Crisostomo conveyed to the defendant a lot of land in Calle Novaliches, in Manila, for an expressed consideration of 600 pesos.  In 1897 three other tracts of land were conveyed to the defendant by their then owners.  In 1899 another tract was so conveyed by its then owner to the defendant, and in 1900 two other lots  of land  were conveyed by their then owners to the defendant.  Crisostomo  having died, the plaintiff brought  this action asking that it be declared that these parcels of land  belonged to  the  conjugal  partnership formed by herself and Crisostomo on  the ground that the conveyances were fraudulent as  to her.  Judgment was entered in  the court below for the defendant  Plaintiff moved for  a new trial,  which  was denied, and she has brought this case here by bill of  exceptions.</p>
<p>The theory of the appellant is that the lot of land which was  conveyed  directly by the husband  to  the defendant was  conveyed  without  any consideration,  and that the defendant paid nothing for such  conveyance.  As to the other six tracts of land, her theory is that the money which was paid therefor to the then owners thereof was paid by her husband, and nothing was contributed by the defendant to the purchase price thereof.  The evidence to support this claim is found first in the testimony of the  witness Lucena Baldonado.   Her testimony was to the effect that she had  known  the  defendant  for  some time,  and that during this .time the defendant was very poor,  and lived by charity.  It is very evident  that the acquaintance  between defendant and the witness was merely casual.   Most of her evidence relates to the time when  the defendant lived in Intramuros,  where the witness resided, and it is altogether too indefinite in its character to prove that the defendant did not, in 1896 and the following years, have means with which to  buy the properties in question.   The only  other evidence in the case to show that the money for these purchases was furnished by Crisostomo was the statement of two witnesses to the effect that they saw him directing the construction of houses which  were erected upon the lots in question.</p>
<p>After examining all the evidence in the case we can not say that it preponderates against the decision of the trial court.  The  judgment of that court is affirmed, with the costs of this instance  against the appellant, and after the expiration of twenty  days judgment should be entered in accordance herewith and the case remanded to the court below for execution  of said judgment.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Mapa, Johnson,</em> and <em>Carson, JJ., </em>concur.<br>
