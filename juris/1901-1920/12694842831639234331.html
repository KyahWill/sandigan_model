				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an original action brought in this court under authority of sections 
197, 201, 202, and 519 of the Code of Civil Procedure by reason of the alleged 
usurpation of a public civil office.
<p>The facts upon which the petitioner relied for relief as against the original 
respondent Juan Javier are set out at length in our judgment on the demurrer to 
the original petition filed March 17, 1917.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Upon that demurrer we held that the 
original respondent, Juan Javier, was unlawfully in possession of the office of 
municipal president of the Municipality of Candelaria, Tayabas, and that the 
petitioner Remata was lawfully entitled to that office. This judgment was based 
upon our ruling that it appearing that at the general elections, held on June 6, 
1916, no one was legally elected president of that municipality, and that the 
petitioner had been lawfully elected vice-president, he was entitled to the 
office of president, under the provisions of section 2126 of the Administrative 
Code of 1916, the law in force at the time when the elections were held.</p>
<p>A short time prior to the entry of that judgment, section 2126 of the 
Administrative Code was amended by the enactment of Act No. 2707 of the 
Philippine Legislature, which is as follows:</p>
<p>"AN ACT TO AMEND SECTION TWENTY-ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SIX OF THE 
ADMINISTRATIVE CODE, PROVIDING HOW ELECTIVE MUNICIPAL OFFICES SHALL BE FILLED 
WHEN VACANT OR WHEN THERE IS NO SUCCESSOR.</p>
<p>"<em>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
Philippines in Legislature assembled and by the authority of the same:</em></p>
<p>"Section 1. Section twenty-one hundred and twenty-six of the Administrative 
Code is hereby amended to read as follows:</p>
<p>" 'Sec. 2126. <em>Vacancies in municipal office</em>.â€” (a) In case of a 
temporary vacancy in any municipal office, the same shall be filled by 
appointment by the provincial governor, with the consent of the provincial 
board.</p>
<p>" '(<em>b</em>) In case of a permanent vacancy in any municipal office, the 
same shall be filled by appointment by the provincial board, except in case of a 
municipal president, in which the permanent vacancy shall be filled by the 
municipal vice-president.</p>
<p>" ' (<em>c</em>) In case of the failure of an election for any municipal 
office, or when the officer elect declines to qualify or dies before qualifying, 
or there is no successor for any other reason, such successor shall, in the 
discretion of the Secretary of the Interior, be appointed by the provincial 
board or elected at a special election convened by the Governor-General the same 
as other special elections.'</p>
<p>"Sec. 2. This. Act shall take effect in so far as the same is applicable to 
the general election held on June sixth, nineteen hundred and sixteen.</p>
<p>"Sec. 3. This Act shall take effect on its approval.</p>
<p>"Effective March 11, 1917."</p>
<p>Pending further proceedings upon our judgment on the demurrer to the original 
petition, the petitioner was permitted to file a supplemental petition making 
Generoso de Gala a party respondent, and alleging that under color of authority 
conferred by subsection (<em>c</em>) of section 1 of Act No. 2707, the 
Provincial Board of Tayabas, with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, 
appointed De Gala municipal president of the Municipality of Candelaria; that 
the original respondent had turned the office over to De Gala; and that De Gala 
is unlawfully in possession of the office.</p>
<p>The case is now before us upon De Gala's demurrer to the supplemental 
petition.</p>
<p>Citing and relying upon the various arguments set forth by Justice Moreland 
in support of his dissent from our ruling upon the demurrer to the original 
petition, counsel for De Gala urges us to reverse our former ruling as to the 
construction which should be placed upon section 2126 of the Administrative Code 
of 1916, and to give it the same meaning and effect before amendment as it 
undoubtedly has since its amendment by the enactment of Act No. 2707. But all 
arguments and contentions advanced in the dissenting opinion filed with our 
former ruling were maturely considered and rejected when this question was 
raised upon the demurrer to the original petition, and we are of opinion that it 
should not be reopened and must be deemed to have been definitely settled by our 
rulings on that occasion.</p>
<p>It follows that the only real question before us at this time is whether the 
enactment of Act No. 2707, amending section 2126 of the Administrative Code of 
1916, had the effect of depriving the petitioner of the right to the office, 
which, as we held in our former ruling, he had acquired under the terms of that 
section prior to its amendment, by virtue of his election as vice-president, and 
the judicial declaration in an election contest of a failure of election for the 
office of municipal president at the general elections held June 6, 1916.</p>
<p>Act No. 2707 became effective March 11, 1917, long after the election of June 
6, 1916. Under well-settled principles of construction, its provisions should 
not be given a retroactive effect except in so far as the intention of the 
legislator so to do is made apparent by its express terms or by necessary 
implication.</p>
<p>Section 2 of the Act expressly provides that it "shall take (have) effect in 
so far as the same is applicable to the general election held on June 6, 1916." 
The purpose of the statute, both before and after its amendment, is to provide a 
method for the filling of vacancies in municipal offices. None of its provisions 
become applicable until and unless there is a vacancy in a municipal office. 
Neither the original nor the amended statute purports to deprive any one of an 
office, or a right to an office lawfully acquired prior to its enactment. 
Section 2 of the statute must not therefore be understood as authorizing the 
ousting from office of any one who had lawfully become entitled thereto at or as 
a result of the general election of June 6, 1916. It goes no further than to 
provide that any municipal office (including those for which an election was 
held at the general elections in June, 1916), which is found vacant must be 
filled in accordance with its terms. Thus, if as a result of an election 
contest, pending at the time the statute was enacted, the court, wherein the 
contest is heard, should thereafter declare that there had been a failure of an 
election for any municipal office, the vacancy thus created must be filled in 
accordance with the provisions of the amended statute. And in like manner, its 
terms would be applicable in filling any municipal office if the officer elected 
at the general elections in 1916 declined to qualify or died before qualifying, 
and a successor had not yet been appointed when the amended statute became 
effective. But we are satisfied that the statute as amended could have no 
application to a case wherein such a vacancy had already been filled by 
appointment or otherwise at the time when the amended statute became effective. 
In that event, there would be no vacancy upon which the provisions of the 
amended statute could operate. The discretion of the Secretary of the Interior 
to authorize the filling of a municipal office by appointment or election may be 
exercised only in the event that there is a vacancy in such office; and if some 
person has lawfully acquired a right thereto there is no such vacancy therein as 
would justify the Secretary of the Interior in exercising his discretion to fill 
it by appointment or election.</p>
<p>There was no vacancy in the office of the municipal president of Candelaria 
at the time when Act No. 2707 became effective, nor has any occurred since that 
date (March 11, 1917). Under the law in force prior to the enactment of the 
amending statute, the petitioner had already acquired the right to the office, 
and stood ready and still stands ready to perform the duties of the office. The 
mere fact that he was excluded unlawfully from an office to which he was 
lawfully entitled did not have the effect of creating a vacancy in that office, 
so long as he did not decline to qualify and stood ready to perform the duties 
of the office.</p>
<p>It follows that assuming the truth and accuracy of the averment in the 
amended petition, the appointment of the respondent De Gala to the office of 
municipal president of Candelaria was not authorized under the provisions of Act 
No. 2707; that he must, therefore, be held to be unlawfully in possession of 
that office; and that the petitioner is entitled to have him ousted therefrom 
and to take possession of the office from which he is wrongfully excluded.</p>
<p>We must not be understood as questioning the power of the legislator to 
abrogate or to modify the mode by which Vacancies in municipal offices may be 
filled; or to provide for the vacating of all such offices and the filling of 
such vacancies by election or otherwise; or in its discretion to do away with 
such offices altogether, and thus to legislate all municipal officers out of 
office, without regard to the mode by which they had acquired them. Our ruling 
is not that the legislator did not have the power to oust from office municipal 
officers elected at the general elections in 1916, but that he did not do so by 
the enactment of Act No. 2707, which provides merely for the filling and not for 
the creation of vacancies in such offices.</p>
<p>We conclude that the demurrer to the amended petition should be overruled, 
and that unless an answer is filed within ten days (which we do not anticipate, 
as there is no real dispute as to the facts), judgment should be entered 
declaring the petitioner to be lawfully entitled to the office of municipal 
president of Candelaria, and the respondent De Gala to be unlawfully in 
possession of the same, with the costs of these proceedings against the 
latter.</p>
<p>We assume that after the promulgation of our rulings as to the respective 
rights of the parties, the office in question will be promptly surrendered to 
the petitioner upon demand, and we shall not, for the present, make any 
provision for the forcible ouster of the respondent therefrom; but in the event 
that our anticipations are not verified in this regard, the petitioner is 
expressly authorized to make application for such further orders and relief as 
may be necessary to secure his rights in the premises.</p>
