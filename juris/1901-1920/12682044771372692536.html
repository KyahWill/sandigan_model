				<H3>CHUA SHUN, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. THE INSULAR COLLECTOR OF CUSTOMS, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">From an examination of the record, the following facts seem to be established 
by a large preponderance of the evidence:
<p>First. That the said Chua Shun is a person of Chinese descent, a minor about 
20 years of age, and the legitimate son of Chua Pingco.</p>
<p>Second. That the said Chua Pingco was a Chinese merchant and a resident of 
the Philippine Islands.</p>
<p>Third. That the said Chua Shun came to the Philippine Islands the first time 
when he was about 11 years of age, in the year 1903 or 1904, and was permitted 
to enter the Islands as the minor and legitimate son of Chua Pingco.</p>
<p>Fourth. That the said Chua Shun remained in the Philippine Islands until the 
year 1907, when he returned to China, in company with his father; that he 
returned from China to the Philippine Islands in the same year (1907), with his 
father and they were both permitted to enter.</p>
<p>Fifth. That the said Chua Shun remained in the Philippine Islands after his 
return in 1907, until the month of November, 1909, when he again visited 
China.</p>
<p>Sixth. That the said Chua Pingco, while still a resident merchant of the 
Philippine Islands, died in the city of Manila, on the 10th day of January, 
1909.</p>
<p>Seventh. That Chua Pingco left an estate in the Philippine Islands valued at 
about P186,000,</p>
<p>Eighth. That an administrator was duly appointed for his estate; that a 
guardian was appointed for his minor children; that before Chua Shun returned to 
China in the month of November, 1909, he obtained permission of the court, as 
well as the consent of his guardian, so to do.</p>
<p>Ninth. That the share of the estate of Chua Pingco belonging to the said Chua 
Shun was more than P6,000.</p>
<p>Tenth. That Chua Shun was engaged in the cigarette business in the city of 
Manila.</p>
<p>Eleventh. That he returned to the Philippine Islands on the steamship Taisang 
on the 2d day of January, 1913, while he was still a minor of about 20 years of 
age, and was refused admission, upon the ground that he was a person of Chinese 
descent.</p>
<p>The board of special inquiry, after hearing the evidence presented by the 
said Chua Shun relating to his right to land in the Philippine Islands, in its 
order denying to him the right to enter, said: "As the only right of the 
detained to enter the Philippine Islands would be the actual presence of his 
father, the board finds and decides that the said Chua Shun is coming to the 
Philippine Islands without the certificate required by law for the admission of 
Chinese of the exempt class, and he is, therefore, refused landing.‚Äù</p>
<p>From this decision Chua Shun appealed to the Insular Collector of Customs. In 
passing upon the questions presented by the appeal, the Honorable B. Herstein, 
Insular Collector of Customs, among other things, said: "He cannot be admitted 
as the legitimate minor son of a resident Chinese merchant, by reason of the 
fact that not alone at the time of his entrance on January 2, 1913, but also at 
the time of his departure in November, 1909, his father was dead."</p>
<p>Immediately after the petitioner was denied the right to admission into the 
Philippine Islands, he presented a petition for the writ of habeas corpus in the 
Court of First Instance of the city of Manila. The petition was duly considered 
by the Honorable A. S. Crossfield, judge, who found as a fact: "That Chua Shun 
is the minor son of a Chinese merchant, residing in and doing business in the 
city of Manila, and that the petitioner resided, as such minor son, in the city 
of Manila for more than five years; that his father died and the petitioner 
succeeded to a portion of his father's mercantile business, as heir thereto, 
and, because of his minor age, became a ward of this court and was allowed to 
leave the Philippine Islands, by order of the court, on account of his health; 
that upon his return from his journey of health seeking, he was refused landing 
in the Philippine Islands, on the ground that his father was no longer a 
resident of the Philippine Islands."</p>
<p>Upon the foregoing facts, the lower court reversed the order of the Collector 
of Customs and admitted Chua Shun into the Philippine Islands. From that order 
the Insular Collector of Customs appealed to this court.</p>
<p>The only question which is left for us to decide is whether or not the death 
of the father of Chua Shun had the effect of depriving him of the right to 
continue to reside in the Philippine Islands. It will be remembered that he was 
permitted to land as the legitimate minor son of Chua Pingco and had continued 
to reside in the Philippine Islands with his father for a period of more than 
three years, and that the occasion of his leaving the islands ten or eleven 
months after the death of his father was to regain his health. We do not 
believe, had he remained in the Philippine Islands after the death of his 
father, that he could have been deported upon any theory, having once been 
admitted as the legitimate minor son of a resident Chinese merchant. As such 
legitimate minor son, having once been admitted and having become a part of the 
population of the country, we do not believe that the mere death of his father 
had the effect of depriving him of his right to remain. And if he had the right 
to remain, we cannot understand upon what theory he lost his residence in the 
Philippine Islands, simply by the fact that he left the Islands for a short 
period for the purpose of regaining his health. It is true that when he left the 
Islands on the 2d day of January, 1909, he did not get the usual document from 
the Insular Collector of Customs which is obtained by Chinamen generally who 
leave the Philippine Islands with the intention of returning. At that time, 
however, we are of the opinion that such certificate was unnecessary. (U. S. 
<em>vs.</em> Gue Lim, 176 U. S., 459; Lo Po <em>vs.</em> McCoy, 8 Phil. Rep., 
343; U. S. <em>vs.</em> Yu Kiao, 20 Phil. Rep., 307.) We do not believe that 
Congress intended, when it adopted the Chinese Exclusion Laws, to prohibit 
Chinese aliens from continuing to reside in the territory of the United States, 
under the circumstances such as exist in the present case. Neither do we 
believe, after the minor children of resident Chinese merchants in the territory 
of the United States have been admitted and have resided in such territory with 
their parents, that they lose their right to remain in or to reenter said 
territory, simply because subsequent to their entrance their parents have died. 
(U. S. <em>vs.</em> Gue Lim, 176 U. S., 459; U. S. <em>vs.</em> Yu Kiao, 20 
Phil. Rep., 307.)</p>
<p>Therefore the judgment of the lower court is hereby affirmed, with costs.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Carson,</em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.,</em> 
concur.</p>
<p><em>Moreland, J.,</em> concurs in the result.<br><br></p></div>
