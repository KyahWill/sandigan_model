				<BR><BR><div align="justify">REGISTRATION OF LAND; CHANGE IN BED OF RIVER. — From the Court of Land Registration. Ross, J.<br><br>Petitioner sought to register land which he alleged was undivided property of himself and wife.&nbsp; Opponent claimed part ownership, and secured judgment to that effect.&nbsp; Petitioner originally acquired his land by composition with the Spanish Government.&nbsp; It was bounded on the north by Cutcut River, which changed its course and formed a new bed, but the old bed was still in existence and was also known as Cutcut. Court below found that the title referred to the old river bed, otherwise the area sought to be registered was much larger than shown by the title, which would require to be amended. The objector had been in possession of his part of land for thirty years. Judgment affirmed.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Per Mapa, J.</span><br>For appellant: Ramon Salinas.<br>For appellee: Pedro N. Liongson.</div>
