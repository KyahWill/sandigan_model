				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The defendants&nbsp; in this action, at the time of the execution of the contract hereinafter presented, were&nbsp; merchants doing&nbsp; business in the city of Manila and in other places in the Philippine Islands.&nbsp; On the 12th&nbsp; day of June, 1902, the plaintiff and the defendants executed the following contract at Hyderabad Sindh, India:<br><blockquote>"I, the undersigned,&nbsp; Chatamal Tikumal Hindu,&nbsp; aged 26 years, of Hyderabad Sindh, do hereby&nbsp; agree&nbsp; to enter the service&nbsp; of Messrs.&nbsp; Pohoomul&nbsp; Brothers,&nbsp; namely, Mr. Moolchand, Mr. Lekraj, and Mr.&nbsp; Sahijram, sons1 of Khiamull, on the following conditions:<br><br>"1. That I&nbsp; shall serve the said firm for the period of three years, commencing on the________day of the month of _______1902, in any place&nbsp; they may&nbsp; like&nbsp; to send me, at the salary of&nbsp; Rs. 45 per month for&nbsp; the said period and to be supplied with my daily food by the said firm during the period of my&nbsp; serving them.<br><br>"2. That all&nbsp; my traveling expenses&nbsp; to and&nbsp; from any place shall&nbsp; be at the charge of the said&nbsp; firm.<br><br>"3. My salary will commence from the date&nbsp; of departure and will be ceased from the date of leaving the destination.<br><br>"4. That I bind myself to serve the said firm honestly and faithfully and be&nbsp; obedient to my masters,&nbsp; their managers or persons in&nbsp; charge of their business in any place or at any time I&nbsp; shall&nbsp; be serving and I shall do the works they impose on me.<br><br>"5. The accounts to&nbsp; be settled at Bombay or&nbsp; Hyderabad Sindh, where the said&nbsp; masters wish.<br><br>"6. The&nbsp; accounts&nbsp; to be settled on the rate&nbsp; of&nbsp; English months.<br><br>"7. That I shall be&nbsp; responsible for anything and every article which will be trusted to me&nbsp; and shall&nbsp; pay all amounts of loss&nbsp; of&nbsp; such articles, as well&nbsp; as all&nbsp; amounts of goods whenever sold by me on credit, and bind myself to render all amounts or parts of them whenever and wherever called upon.<br><br>"8. That if these conditions or any of them is not strictly fulfilled by me, Messrs. Pohoomul Brothers or their agents or anyone in charge of their business at the time will be justified to&nbsp; diiiniss&nbsp; me from their&nbsp; service, retaining all pay or amounts of pay in their hands which may be due to me at&nbsp; the&nbsp; time without having I any right to claim from&nbsp; the firm any amounts or balance of pay and salary.<br><br>"9. If&nbsp; I&nbsp; after&nbsp; signing this agreement I do not enter the service of&nbsp; said company, I&nbsp; will be liable to pay Rs. 200 as damages to said company and will at once return the amount received, with interest from the date of receipt at the rate of Re. 1&nbsp; per cent&nbsp; per annum.<br><br>"10. That I bind&nbsp; myself to leave Hyderabad Sindh as soon as I am ordered&nbsp; by any of the brothers of the&nbsp; said company to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I fail to go I will&nbsp; be liable as in para.&nbsp; 9th.<br><br>"11. The sum of Rs.&nbsp; 25 the&nbsp; above mentioned masters will give here to my parents for the maintain of family members.<br><br>"Dated thus the agreement 12th June, 1902."</blockquote>As&nbsp; shown by the contract&nbsp; itself, it bears date the 12th day of&nbsp; June,&nbsp; 1902.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pursuant to&nbsp; said&nbsp; contract and by virtue&nbsp; of the&nbsp; terms&nbsp; thereof, the&nbsp; plaintiff emigrated to the Philippine&nbsp; Islands, arriving at Manila on the 13th day of October, 1902, and immediately&nbsp; thereafter began work for the defendants as manager of their store at Tacloban. He continued in their employ until the 21st day of May, 1906.&nbsp; During all that time he was the manager of various stores belonging to the defendants in Calbayog,&nbsp; Tacloban, and Jolo and for a short time was&nbsp; employed in the main house&nbsp; in Manila.&nbsp; So far as&nbsp; appears in the evidence, the only occupation&nbsp; in which the plaintiff engaged while in the&nbsp; service of&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants was that&nbsp; of manager of one or the other of their stores referred&nbsp; to.&nbsp; It does not appear except&nbsp; rarely that he worked as&nbsp; a clerk or&nbsp; performed any manual labor whatever, unless the performance of his duties as manager may be held to be such.&nbsp; As&nbsp; shown by the evidence,&nbsp; his work&nbsp; was&nbsp; to a very&nbsp; large&nbsp; extent management.&nbsp;&nbsp; We can not assume, for the purpose of bringing the plaintiff within the statute, that he contracted to do&nbsp; prohibited work or that he worked as a laborer while here.&nbsp; (U. S. <i>vs.</i> Gay. 80 Fed. Rep., 254.)<br><br>During such employment the plaintiff received from the defendants the&nbsp; sum of Pl,208.76.<br><br>After&nbsp; the term mentioned in the contract had&nbsp; expired, the plaintiff&nbsp; discovered,&nbsp; as he believed, that the contract under&nbsp; which he came to the Philippine Islands was void under the laws of the United States prohibiting the importation of alien labor, and&nbsp; thereupon brought this action to recover the value of his services, disregarding entirely the said contract and the&nbsp; terms thereof and asserting his right to recover on a <i>quantum meruit.</i><br><br>The&nbsp; defendants set up as&nbsp; their first defense that even though said contract was void, as in violation of said laws of Congress,&nbsp; still it is valid and binding upon the parties thereto for the reason that it has been fully executed by them.&nbsp; As a second defense they allege that some time prior to the&nbsp; commencement of this action&nbsp; they and the plaintiff made a full and complete settlement of their respective accounts and claims under said contract, observing strictly the terms thereof, and that it was found upon such settlement that there was due from the plaintiff to the defendants the sum of ^528.38, for which sum the plaintiff then and there gave his&nbsp; promissory note.&nbsp;&nbsp; They ask an affirmative judgment against the plaintiff for that amount.<br><br>As to the first defense, the plaintiff replied and asserted that the contract was absolutely void, it being clearly within the&nbsp; prohibition of the laws of Congress&nbsp; relating to the importation of alien labor and it could not, therefore, be an executed&nbsp; contract in the sense asserted by the defendants in their first defense.&nbsp;&nbsp; As to the second defense, the plaintiff admits the execution and&nbsp; delivery of the note, but alleges that the same was voidable because it&nbsp; had been&nbsp; executed by him while under duress caused by threats on the part of the defendants.<br><br>The court below in his decision found that the contract was void&nbsp; as claimed by the plaintiff, that the note given&nbsp; in pursuance of said settlement was made and executed by the plaintiff through excessive and controlling fear caused by the threats of the defendants to put him in state prison for a series of years, and that,&nbsp; for that reason, the execution of said note occurred while plaintiff&nbsp; was&nbsp; laboring under such fear and intimidation that he did not act of his own free will.&nbsp;&nbsp; Approving plaintiff's claim of a right to recover upon a <i>quantum meruit,</i> the court below disregarded the said contract wholly and gave the plaintiff a judgment for Pl,208.86, and interest at 6 per cent from June 1, 1906.<br><br>This case does not fall within the provisions of the Act of Congress of March 3, 1903, but within the Acts hereinafter quoted.&nbsp; (Fornow <i>vs</i>. Hoffmeister,&nbsp; 6 Phil. Rep., 33.)<br><br>The Act of Congress of February 26, 1885, so far as it is material to the issues in this&nbsp; case, reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"<i>Be it enacted, etc.,</i> That from and after the passage of this&nbsp; Act it&nbsp; shall be&nbsp; unlawful for&nbsp; any&nbsp; person, company, partnership, or corporation, in any&nbsp; manner whatsoever, to prepay the transportation, or in any way assist or encourage the importation&nbsp; or migration of any alien or aliens, any foreigner or foreigners, into the United States, its Territories, or the District of Columbia, under contract or agreement, parol or special, express or implied, made previous to the importation or migration&nbsp; of such alien or aliens, foreigner or foreigners, to perform labor or service of any kind in the United States, its Territories, or&nbsp; the&nbsp; District of Columbia.<br><br>"SEC. 2.&nbsp; That all contracts or agreements, express or implied, parol or special, which may hereafter be made by and between&nbsp; any person,&nbsp; company, partnership, or corporation, and any&nbsp; foreigner or foreigners,&nbsp; alien or aliens, to perform labor or&nbsp; service or having reference to the performance of labor or service by any person&nbsp; in&nbsp; the United States, its Territories, or the District of Columbia previous to the migration&nbsp; or&nbsp; importation of the person&nbsp; or persons whose labor or service&nbsp; is contracted for into the United States, shall be utterly void and&nbsp; of no effect.<br><br>"SEC. 3.&nbsp; That for every violation of any of the provisions of section one of this&nbsp; Act the person, partnership, company, or corporation violating the same, by knowingly assisting, encouraging, or soliciting the migration&nbsp; or importation of any alien or aliens, foreigner or foreigners, into the United States, its&nbsp; Territories, or the District of Columbia, to perform labor or service of any kind under contract or agreement, express or implied, parol or special,&nbsp; with such alien or aliens, foreigner&nbsp; or&nbsp; foreigners,&nbsp; previous to becoming residents or citizens of the United States, shall forfeit and pay for every such offense the sum of one thousand dollars, which may be sued for and recovered by the United States or by any person&nbsp; who shall first bring his&nbsp; action therefor, including any such alien or foreigner who may be a party to any such contract or agreement, as debts of like amount are now recovered in the&nbsp; circuit courts of the United States; the proceeds to be paid into the Treasury of&nbsp; the&nbsp; United States; and separate suits may be brought for each alien or foreigner being a party to such contract or&nbsp; agreement aforesaid.&nbsp; And it shall be the duty of the district attorney of the proper&nbsp; district to prosecute every such suit at the expense of the&nbsp; United States.<br><center><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*<br></center><br>"SEC. 5. That nothing in this Act shall be so construed as to prevent any citizen or subject of any foreign country temporarily residing in the United States, either in private or official capacity, from engaging, under contract or otherwise, persons not residents or citizens of the United States to act as private secretaries, servants, or domestics for such foreigner temporarily&nbsp; residing&nbsp; in the United&nbsp; States&nbsp; as aforesaid;<br><br>"Nor shall&nbsp; this&nbsp; Act&nbsp; be so&nbsp; construed&nbsp; as to prevent any person or persons,&nbsp; partnership, or corporation from engaging, under contract or agreement, skilled workmen in foreign countries to perform labor in the United States in or&nbsp; upon any new industry not at present established in the United States:<br><br><i>"Provided</i>, That&nbsp; skilled labor for that purpose can not be otherwise obtained; nor shall the provisions&nbsp; of this Act apply to professional actors, artists, lecturers, or singers, nor&nbsp; to persons employed strictly as personal or domestic servants:<br><br>"<i>Provided,</i> That nothing in this Act shall be construed as prohibiting any individual from assisting any member&nbsp; of his family or any&nbsp; relative or personal&nbsp; friend to migrate from any foreign&nbsp; country to&nbsp; the&nbsp; United States,&nbsp; for the purpose of settlement here."</blockquote>This&nbsp; has&nbsp; been&nbsp; amended and&nbsp; supplemented by several subsequent enactments,&nbsp; but not in a way to affect the questions involved in this action.<br><br>It is evident from reading the statute that, so far as the present action is&nbsp; concerned,&nbsp; the&nbsp; main&nbsp; provisions of the Act are: (1) That the prepayment of transportation or the assistance or encouragement of the immigration of aliens or foreigners under a contract to labor in the United States is unlawful; and (2)&nbsp; that such contracts made previous to their emigration are utterly void and of no effect.<br><br>The evidence is undisputed that the contract in this action was made at Hyderabad Sindh on the 12th of June, 1902, and&nbsp; that the&nbsp; purpose of the contract was&nbsp; to secure the emigration&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippine Islands in order that&nbsp; he might serve the defendants as manager of one or more of their stores located therein.&nbsp; The contract contains an express provision for the payment by defendants of the expense of transportation&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff to these Islands,&nbsp;&nbsp; It is admitted that the plaintiff, at the time of the execution of the contract in question and at the time of his&nbsp; emigration to these Islands, was an alien and&nbsp; a foreigner, being a native of British India and a subject of that empire.<br><br>The facts proved in the case bring the contract clearly within&nbsp; the&nbsp; prohibition&nbsp; and condemnation of the statute above quoted provided the plaintiff&nbsp; may be considered&nbsp; a laborer within the meaning of that Act.<br><br>In the case of Holy Trinity Church <i>vs.</i> United States (143 U. S., 457), the court said at pages 463, 464, and 465:<br><blockquote>"Again,&nbsp; another guide&nbsp; to the&nbsp; meaning of a statute is found in the evil&nbsp; which it is designed to remedy; and for this the court properly looks&nbsp; at&nbsp; contemporaneous events, the situation as it existed, and as it was pressed&nbsp; upon the attention of the legislative body.&nbsp;&nbsp; (United States<i> vs.</i> Union Pacific Railroad, 91 U.&nbsp; S., 72, 79.)&nbsp; The situation which called for this statute was briefly but fully stated by Mr. Justice Brown when, as district judge, he decided the case of United States vs. Craig (28 Fed. Rep., 795, 798): 'The motives and history of the Act&nbsp; are matters of&nbsp; common knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp; It had become the&nbsp; practice for large capitalists in this country to contract with their agents abroad for the shipment of great numbers of an ignorant and servile class of foreign laborers, under contracts, by which&nbsp; the employer agreed, upon the one hand, to prepay their passage, while, upon the other hand, the laborers agreed to work after their arrival for a certain&nbsp; time at a low rate of wages.&nbsp; The effect of this was to break down the labor market, and to reduce other laborers engaged in&nbsp; like occupations to the level of the assisted immigrant.&nbsp; The evil finally became so flagrant that an appeal was made to Congress for relief by the passage of the&nbsp; Act in question, the design&nbsp; of which was to raise the standard of&nbsp; foreign immigrants, and to discountenance the migration&nbsp; of those who had not sufficient means in their own hands, or those of their friends, to pay their passage.'<br><br>"It appears, also, from the petitions, and in the testimony presented before the committees of Congress, that it was this cheap unskilled labor which was making the trouble, and&nbsp; the influx of which&nbsp; Congress sought to prevent.&nbsp; It was never suggested that we had in this country a surplus of brain toilers, and, least of all, that the market for the services of Christian ministers was depressed by foreign competition. Those were&nbsp; matters&nbsp; to&nbsp; which the attention of Congress, or of the people, was not&nbsp; directed.&nbsp;&nbsp; So far, then, as the evil which was sought to be remedied interprets the statute, it also&nbsp; guides to&nbsp; an exclusion of this contract from the penalties of&nbsp; the Act.<br><center><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*<br></center><br>"We find, therefore,&nbsp; that the title of the Act, the evil which was intended to be&nbsp; remedied, the circumstances surrounding the&nbsp; appeal to Congress, the reports of the committee&nbsp; of each House,&nbsp; all&nbsp; concur in affirming&nbsp; that the intent of&nbsp; Congress was simply to&nbsp; stay the influx of this cheap&nbsp; unskilled labor."</blockquote>In the case of the United States <i>vs. </i>Laws&nbsp; (163 U. S., 258), the&nbsp; court cites and approves&nbsp; the doctrine laid down in the above case, and in speaking of the&nbsp; opinion written in that case says, at page 264:<br><blockquote>"Upon the basis, therefore, that it could not be imputed as the intention of Congress, notwithstanding the language used in the Act, to prevent the introduction of religious teachers, it was held that the Act did not apply to the case before the court.&nbsp;&nbsp; Both grounds were covered in the opinion; the one that the&nbsp; Act was&nbsp; clearly intended&nbsp; to&nbsp; apply only to cheap, unskilled&nbsp; labor, and&nbsp; the&nbsp; other that&nbsp; in no event could it be construed as applying&nbsp; to a contract for the services of a rector or a pastor of a religious corporation.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first ground covers the case in hand.&nbsp;&nbsp; The construction given to the words 'labor or service' by this court in the above case was neither forced, unnatural, nor unusual. Considering the clear purpose of the Act, the construction adopted was a natural and proper one."</blockquote>To quote further from the opinion&nbsp; in this case,&nbsp; pages 264 and 265:<br><blockquote>"In Aikin <i>vs</i>. Wasson (24 N. Y., 482)&nbsp; the plaintiff contracted with a railroad company to&nbsp; construct part&nbsp; of its road.&nbsp; Defendant was a stockholder in the company, which became insolvent.&nbsp; It&nbsp; was indebted&nbsp; to&nbsp; plaintiff for the services of himself and his laborers and servants&nbsp; under his contract.&nbsp; Section 10 of the Railroad Act enacted that 'all the stockholders of every such company shall be jointly and severally liable for all the debts due or owing to any of its&nbsp; laborers and servants for services&nbsp; performed for such corporation.'&nbsp;&nbsp; It was held that the plaintiff was neither a laborer nor a servant within the meaning of the Act.<br><br>"In Coffin <i>vs. </i>Reynolds&nbsp; (37 N. Y., 640) the statute reads: 'The stockholders of a company organized under the provisions of this Act shall be jointly&nbsp; and&nbsp; severally individually liable for all debts that may be due and owing to all their laborers, servants, and apprentices for services performed for such corporation.'&nbsp; The plaintiff&nbsp; was the secretary of the company and commenced an action against the defendant as a stockholder to recover the amount&nbsp; of his salary, the company being insolvent.&nbsp; It was&nbsp; held that he could not recover.&nbsp; He was not a&nbsp; laborer or a servant within the meaning of the statute.<br><br>"In Wakefield <i>vs. </i>Fargo (90 N. Y.,&nbsp; 213), under the same statute, it was held that one who&nbsp; was employed at a yearly salary&nbsp; as bookkeeper and general manager was not&nbsp; a laborer, servant, or apprentice within the meaning of the Act, and hence that he could not recover against the stockholders for a balance of salary due him from the insolvent corporation.<br><br>"These&nbsp; statutes were&nbsp; passed&nbsp; for the protection&nbsp; of&nbsp; laborers, servants, apprentices, and the like, and the opinions of the courts in relation to the class of individuals that would be included within the meaning of those terms are somewhat relevant, although not entirely analogous, to the case before this court."</blockquote>It thus&nbsp; appears that the&nbsp; Supreme Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; the United States has decided clearly and definitely that the only&nbsp; laborers to which the Act in question refers are those engaged in <i>cheap, unskilled</i> labor.<br><br>In the case of the&nbsp; United States <i>vs.</i> Gay (80 Fed. Rep., 254), it was held that the Acts of February 26, 1885, and March 3, 1891, "are highly penal and must be so construed as to bring within their condemnation only those who are shown by&nbsp; direct&nbsp; and positive averments&nbsp; to&nbsp; be embraced within their terms;"&nbsp; and "they are to be construed in the light of the evil to be remedied, and are&nbsp; limited to cases in which the&nbsp; assisted immigrant is&nbsp; brought into this country under a contract to perform manual labor or service."&nbsp; This case was affirmed in 37 C. C. A., 46.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>From&nbsp; the doctrine&nbsp; laid down by the cases referred to it is clear to&nbsp; our minds that the plaintiff in this action does not come within the prohibited&nbsp; class.&nbsp;&nbsp; We are confirmed in this view by an examination&nbsp; of the&nbsp; decisions&nbsp; of&nbsp; other jurisdictions.&nbsp; While&nbsp; not&nbsp; analogous to the case under consideration,&nbsp; they are helpful&nbsp; and instructive.<br><br>The court, in the case of&nbsp; Brockway <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Innes&nbsp; (39&nbsp; Mich., 47), interpreted&nbsp; the&nbsp; provision of the constitution of the State of Michigan which&nbsp; provided that&nbsp; corporation&nbsp; stockholders should be liable&nbsp; "for labor performed for such corporations."&nbsp; In that case an attempt was made to make the stockholders of the corporation&nbsp; liable for the services of an assistant chief engineer.&nbsp; The court in deciding that case said (p. 48):<br><blockquote>"But we&nbsp; feel very sure&nbsp; that the position of an assistant chief engineer would&nbsp; never have&nbsp; been classed as that of a laborer, nor his work as labor, in the popular sense.&nbsp; It is mostly direction and scientific work, involving much more superintendence than&nbsp; personal&nbsp; exertion in manual labor. He is chosen for his knowledge and not for his muscular capacity,&nbsp; in which latter quality he may or may not be eminent."</blockquote>In&nbsp; the case of Trust Company <i>vs.</i> Grand Rapids Democrat&nbsp; (113 Mich., 615)&nbsp; the question of the right of preference arose under a statute reading as follows:<br><blockquote>"The funds which shall be owed for labor by any person, persons, or corporation at&nbsp; the&nbsp; time he, they, or it shall become insolvent, shall be&nbsp; preferred claims, etc."</blockquote>The nature of the work performed by the person claiming preference&nbsp; "was the writing of editorials and the performing of various kinds of editorial work required&nbsp; to be done&nbsp; on the daily and weekly issues of the Grand Rapids Democrat,&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; preparation&nbsp; and correction&nbsp; of copy&nbsp; for the printers,&nbsp; the direction&nbsp; of the make-up of the paper, including full charge of all branches of the mechanical department of said paper after the close of the business office&nbsp; each night."&nbsp; Another claim for preference was presented by&nbsp; one who was engaged in "proof reading and traveling&nbsp; around the city gathering news,"&nbsp; Another claim for preference was presented&nbsp; by one&nbsp; who was engaged "in reporting, going around to&nbsp; the different wholesale houses, collecting&nbsp; market reports and assisting in&nbsp; editorial&nbsp; work and proof reading."&nbsp; In deciding the case the court said, in regard&nbsp; to these&nbsp; two claimants,&nbsp; "it was the work&nbsp; of professional men rather than&nbsp; the work&nbsp; of laborers, giving the word&nbsp; its ordinary acceptation, and is not such work as is intended to be covered by the statute."<br><br>In the case of Wildner <i>vs.</i> Ferguson&nbsp; (42&nbsp; Minn., 112) it was held, interpreting a statute providing for the exemption of wages,&nbsp; that&nbsp; the words "a laboring man&nbsp; or woman" did not include and protect an agent&nbsp; who sells goods by sample, driving about for that purpose with his own horse and buggy and receiving a weekly salary.<br><br>In the case of Wakefield <i>vs.</i> Fargo (90 N. Y., 213), the question before the court was the interpretation of the meaning of the words "laborers, servants, and apprentices" in a statute making stockholders "liable for all debts that may be due and owed to their laborers, servants, and apprentices for services performed for such corporation."&nbsp;&nbsp; It was held in that case that one employed at a yearly&nbsp; salary as a bookkeeper and general manager is not a laborer,&nbsp; servant, or apprentice within the meaning of the provision of law just quoted.&nbsp; In that case the person&nbsp; seeking&nbsp; the favor of the statute "kept account of the receipts and&nbsp; disbursements of the company, and in the absence of the&nbsp; superintendent had the charge and control of its business."<br><br>In the case of Aiken <i>vs.</i> Wasson (24&nbsp; N. Y., 482), the person seeking the favor of a&nbsp; statute similar to the one in the case last cited was "a contractor with the Albany&nbsp; and Northern&nbsp; Railroad Company,&nbsp; of which&nbsp; the defendant is a stockholder, for the construction of a part of its road."&nbsp; The court said&nbsp; (p. 483) :<br><blockquote>"It is obvious from the nature and terms of this and other provisions&nbsp; of the Act, as well as from&nbsp; the general policy indicated by analogous statutes, that the legislature intended to throw a special protection around that class of persons who should actually perform the manual labor&nbsp; of&nbsp; the company."<br></blockquote>It was held that such contractor was not a laborer within the meaning of the Act.&nbsp;&nbsp; To the same effect are Balch <i>vs.</i> Railroad Co. (46 N. Y., 521); Ericsson<i> vs. </i>Brown (38 Barb. (N. Y.), 390); Stryker <i>vs</i>. Cassidy&nbsp; (10&nbsp; Hun.&nbsp; (N. Y.), 18).<br><br>In the case&nbsp; of the Railroad&nbsp; Co.&nbsp; <i>vs</i>. Leuffer (84 Pa.&nbsp; St., 168), the court said (p. 171):<br><blockquote>"When we speak of the laboring or working classes, we certainly do not intend to include therein persons like civil engineers, the&nbsp; value of whose services rests rather in their scientific than&nbsp; in their physical ability.&nbsp;&nbsp; We thereby intend those who&nbsp; are engaged not in&nbsp; head but&nbsp; in hand work and who depend upon such hand work for their&nbsp; living."<br></blockquote>To the&nbsp; same effect are Heebner <i>vs</i>.&nbsp; Chave&nbsp; (5&nbsp; Pa.&nbsp; St., 117); Seider's Appeal (46 Pa. St., 57); Sullivan's Appeal (77 Pa. St., 107).<br><br>A statute in the State of Texas gave a lien to "mechanics, laborers,, and operators who have performed labor or work with tools, teams, or otherwise in the&nbsp; construction,&nbsp; operation, and repair of&nbsp; any railroad."&nbsp; In the case of Railway <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Mathews&nbsp; (75 Tex.,&nbsp; 92), the court, interpreting that statute, said (p. 94):<br><blockquote>"The word&nbsp; 'laborer,' as used&nbsp; in the statute,&nbsp; evidently means one who performs manual services in the construction, repair, or operation contemplated by the statute&nbsp; and does not embrace one who may work in preparing something of his own to sell to a railway company after it has been rendered suitable through his toil to be used in the construction or repair&nbsp; of a railway."<br></blockquote>In the case of Farinholt <i>vs.</i> Luckhard (90 Va., 936), the court said (p.&nbsp; 938):<br><blockquote>"But we think it safe to say that the word 'laborer,' when used in its ordinary and usual acceptation, carries with it the idea of actual physical and manual exertion or toil and is used&nbsp; to&nbsp; denote that class&nbsp; of persons who literally earn their bread by the&nbsp; sweat of their brows and who perform with their own hands, at the cost of considerable physical labor, the contracts made with their employers."<br></blockquote>In the case&nbsp; of&nbsp; Ho King (14 Fed. Rep., 724) it was held that "the term 'laborer'&nbsp; is used&nbsp; in the treaty with China of November 17, 1880, and the Act in aid thereof of May 6, 1882, in its popular&nbsp; sense,&nbsp; and does not&nbsp; include&nbsp; any person&nbsp; but those whose&nbsp; occupation involves physical toil and who work for wages."&nbsp; It was there held that a Chinese actor or theatrical performer was not a laborer.<br><br>In the&nbsp; case&nbsp; of Malcomson <i>vs. </i>Wappoo Mills&nbsp; (86 Fed. Rep., 192) the question was presented as to who came within the provisions of an Act entitled "An&nbsp; Act to provide for laborers' liens."&nbsp; The court said (p. 198):<br><blockquote>"The body of the Act&nbsp; gives to all employe's in factories, mines, etc., a lien, whether they be employed either by the day or month, whether the&nbsp; contract be in&nbsp; writing or not, to the extent of the salary or wages that may be due.&nbsp; The word 'laborer' does not appear in the body of the Act.&nbsp; To sustain the Act&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; the word 'laborers'&nbsp; must be synonymous with&nbsp; the&nbsp; word 'employes;' and, as the word 'laborers' is used in the title, the word 'employes,' used in the body of the Act, must be so restricted as to mean such employe's as are laborers.&nbsp; This being so, neither the superintendent nor the bookkeeper comes within this term."</blockquote>In the case of Epps <i>vs</i>. Epps&nbsp; (17 111. App., 196)&nbsp; it was held that&nbsp; a bookkeeper was&nbsp; not a laborer within a statute relating to exemptions.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Coffin&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Reynolds, 37&nbsp; N. Y., 640.)<br><br>In the case of Richardson <i>vs</i>. Dexter (85 Me., 372) it was held in ordinary speech a laborer is one who hires himself out, or who&nbsp; is hired out, to do&nbsp; physical toil.&nbsp;&nbsp; (See also Kansas City <i>vs.</i> McDonald, 80 Mo. App., 448; 18 Ency. of Law, p. 71.)<br><br>In the appeal of&nbsp; Clark (100 Mich., 448) it was held that:<br><blockquote>"The general and collecting agent of a corporation engaged&nbsp; in&nbsp; the manufacture and sale of flouring mills and milling machinery, who receives an annual salary and his necessary and reasonable traveling expenses, and who occasionally, in the performance of his duties, performs some manual labor in fixing the machines that have been sold, in operating a new mill and securing its satisfactory running, and in giving instructions to others, is not a 'laborer,' within the meaning of Act No. 94, Laws of&nbsp; 1887, which prefers labor debts due from insolvent corporations."</blockquote>The&nbsp; following cases have held that drummers are not laborers:&nbsp; Wildner&nbsp; <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Ferguson (42 Minn., 112); People <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Remington&nbsp; (109 N. Y., 631); Briscoe <i>vs.</i> Montgomery (93 Ga., 602); Epps <i>vs. </i>Epps (17 111. App., 196) ; Eppstein <i>vs.</i> Webb&nbsp; (44 111. App., 341).<br><br>In the following&nbsp; cases a civil engineer was held not to be a laborer: Railroad Co. <i>vs.</i> Leuffer&nbsp; (84 Pa.&nbsp; St.,&nbsp; 168); Conant <i>vs</i>. Van Schaick (24 Barb. (N. Y.), 87); Brockway <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Innes&nbsp; (39 Mich., 47); State <i>vs.</i> Rusk (55 Wis., 465).<br><br>The following cases have held that a superintendent is not a laborer: Railroad Co. <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Baker (14 Kans., 428) : Blakey <i>vs</i>. Blakey&nbsp; (27 Mo., 39); Malcomson <i>vs,</i> Wappoo Mills (86 Fed. Rep,, 192); Blanchard <i>vs.</i> Railroad Co. (87 Me., 241) ; Cole <i>vs.</i> McNeill, (99 Ga.,&nbsp; 250);&nbsp; Wakefield <i>vs.</i> Fargo (90 N. Y., 213); Hill<i> vs</i>. Spencer&nbsp; (61 N. Y., 274) ; People <i>vs.</i> Remington (109 N. Y., 631); State vs. Rusk (55 Wis., 465); Isbell <i>vs.</i> Dunlap&nbsp; (17 S. C, 581) ; Whitaker <i>vs</i>. Smith (81 N. C, 340); Krauser <i>vs. </i>Ruckel (17 Hun. (N. Y.), 463).<br><br>In State <i>vs</i>. Rusk (55 Wis., 465) it was said that the word "laborer," as employed in the Act empowering the governor to expend certain moneys in paying the claims of laborers, etc.,&nbsp; for work on a line of railway,&nbsp; should be interpreted in the sense in which it is ordinarily used and understood when applied to men engaged in constructing railways.&nbsp; It was held that engineers were not included.<br><br>The court in the case of Bank <i> vs.</i> Shenandoah Iron Co. (35&nbsp; Fed.&nbsp; Rep., 436), interpreting&nbsp; a statute&nbsp; of Virginia giving the wages of employees of an insolvent corporation preference, held that the president of an&nbsp; iron manufacturing company, whose official designation was "general manager," was not entitled to the&nbsp; preference provided by&nbsp; said statute.&nbsp; See England <i>vs.</i> Organ Co. (41 N. J. Eq., 470).<br><br>In Kyle <i>vs</i>. Montgomery&nbsp; (73&nbsp; Ga., 343), the court&nbsp; held that the "boss" of a department of a factory, having charge of the employment and discharge of the&nbsp; men who worked under him, who was required to&nbsp; do no manual labor, but was&nbsp; simply required&nbsp; to exercise his experience and knowledge in the direction of the operatives, can not be regarded as a&nbsp; day&nbsp; laborer within the&nbsp; meaning and&nbsp; intent of the statute exempting the wages of such persons from garnishment.&nbsp;&nbsp; (18 L. R. A., 309.)<br><br>There&nbsp; are many cases holding,&nbsp; in&nbsp; some respects, apparently conflicting doctrines.&nbsp; For example:<br><br>In the case of Heckman <i>vs</i>. Tammen&nbsp; (184 I11., 144) a bookkeeper was held to be&nbsp; a laborer within a statute&nbsp; preferring the laborers of an insolvent employer.<br><br>The following cases have held that a clerk is a laborer: Cole <i>vs.</i> McNeill (99 Ga., 250); Railroad Go.<i> vs.</i> Baker&nbsp; (14 Kans., 428) ; Signor <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Webb&nbsp; (44 111.&nbsp; App.,&nbsp; 338); Epps <i>vs</i>. Epps (17 111. App., 196).<br><br>In the case of Heckman <i>vs</i>. Tammen (184 111., 144), construing an Act entitled "An Act to protect employees and laborers in their claims for wages," in&nbsp; which it was provided that "in all such cases the debts owed to laborers or servants, which have accrued by reason of their labor or employment, shall be considered and treated as preferred claims,&nbsp; and such laborers or employees&nbsp; shall be preferred creditors," it was held that the parties claiming the favor of the&nbsp; statute&nbsp; performed "physical labor as typesetters, cylinder feeders, pressmen,&nbsp; and one&nbsp; also kept the books, at stipulated wages of so much per week.&nbsp; That&nbsp; in their employment they had&nbsp; acquired&nbsp; and used skill would&nbsp; not render the designation 'laborer' inapplicable.&nbsp; They labored with their hands for their employer for wages and were clearly laborers within the meaning of the statute.&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; * While&nbsp; we are disposed to&nbsp; hold&nbsp; that the&nbsp; statute must be confined to those who perform&nbsp; manual service, still it&nbsp; can not be confined to such services only that require&nbsp; no skill in their performance of them."<br><br>In the case of Lawton <i>vs.</i> Richardson (118&nbsp; Mich., 669), the court, interpreting a statute which&nbsp; gave a preference to debts for labor,&nbsp; held that debts due to employees in a dry-goods store, who act as department managers and salesmen, and perform such services as the unpacking of goods, marking them&nbsp; and placing them&nbsp; upon shelves, sweeping out the store, and&nbsp; keeping&nbsp; the&nbsp; stock in order,&nbsp; are debts for labor&nbsp; within the meaning of&nbsp; the statute.&nbsp; The court said (p. 671):<br><blockquote>"The circuit&nbsp; judge found that, as to&nbsp; the work&nbsp; done&nbsp; by Mr. Lawton when in New York,&nbsp; it was not the work of a laborer within the meaning of the statute; but as to the other work done by him, and the work&nbsp; done by the other complainants,&nbsp; it&nbsp; was labor&nbsp; within the meaning of&nbsp; the statute.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is apparent from what has already appeared that nearly&nbsp; all&nbsp; the&nbsp; labor done was not&nbsp; intellectual or&nbsp; supervisional [professional] in its character, nor&nbsp; was it&nbsp; of an especially skillful kind.&nbsp; It was, in&nbsp; the main, manual labor and&nbsp; of such a character as the statute was intended to protect."<br></blockquote>The following cases have held foremen to be laborers: Flagstaff Silver Mining&nbsp; Co. <i>vs</i>. Cullins&nbsp; (104&nbsp; U.&nbsp; S., 176) ; Capron <i>vs.</i> Strout (11 Nev., 304); Kyle <i>vs</i>.&nbsp; Montgomery (73 Ga., 337).<br><br>The following cases have held a&nbsp; superintendent to be a&nbsp; laborer: Gold&nbsp; Mining&nbsp; Co. <i>vs</i>. Bouscher&nbsp; (9 Col., 385); Coraker <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Mathews (25&nbsp; Ga., 571);&nbsp; Moore&nbsp; <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Heaney (14 Md., 559); Pendergast<i> vs</i>. Yandes (124 Ind., 159).<br><br>In the&nbsp; case of&nbsp; Williams <i>vs. </i>Link (64 Miss.,&nbsp; 641), the court said (p. 643):<br><blockquote>"Where&nbsp; physical toil is the main ingredient of services rendered,&nbsp; although directed and made&nbsp; more valuable by skill, the person performing them is a laborer within the meaning of the statute.&nbsp; The appellant is shown by the record to&nbsp; have&nbsp; been a laborer, engaged as a clerk in&nbsp; a store, and the wages earned by him as such&nbsp; laborer are exempt from garnishment."&nbsp;<br></blockquote>In the case of the Flagstaff Silver Mining Co.<i> vs. </i>Culling, <i>supra,</i> the&nbsp; court said (p.&nbsp; 177):<br><blockquote>"Statutes giving liens to laborers and mechanics for their work and labor are to be liberally construed.&nbsp; (Davis <i>vs.</i> Alvord, 94 U. S., 545.)&nbsp; The&nbsp; finding of the&nbsp; district court makes clear the character of the&nbsp; services&nbsp; rendered by the defendant in&nbsp; error.&nbsp; He was not the general agent of the mining business&nbsp; of&nbsp; the plaintiff in error.&nbsp; That office was&nbsp; filled&nbsp; by&nbsp; Patrick.&nbsp; He was&nbsp; not a contractor. His&nbsp; services were not of a professional character, such as those of a mining engineer.&nbsp; He was the overseer and foreman of the body of miners who performed&nbsp; manual labor upon the mine.&nbsp; He&nbsp; planned&nbsp; and&nbsp; personally&nbsp; superintended and directed the work, with a view to develop the mine and make it a successful venture.&nbsp;&nbsp; His duties were similar to&nbsp; those&nbsp; of the foreman of&nbsp; a gang of track hands upon a railroad,&nbsp; or&nbsp; of a force of&nbsp; mechanics engaged in building&nbsp; a house.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such&nbsp; duties&nbsp; are&nbsp; very different&nbsp; from those&nbsp; which&nbsp; belong to the general&nbsp; superintendent&nbsp; of a railroad&nbsp; or the&nbsp; contractor&nbsp; for&nbsp; erecting&nbsp; a house.&nbsp; Their performance may well be called work and labor;&nbsp; they&nbsp; require the personal attention and supervision&nbsp; of the&nbsp; foreman, and occasionally in an emergency, or for an example, it becomes necessary for him to assist with his own hands. They can not be performed without much physical exertion, which, while not so severe as that demanded of the workmen under his control, is nevertheless as really work and labor.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodily toil, as well as some skill and knowledge in directing the&nbsp; work,&nbsp; is required for&nbsp; their successful performance. We think that the discharge of them may well be called&nbsp; work and labor, and that the district court rightfully declared the&nbsp; person who&nbsp; performed them&nbsp; entitled to a lien under the law of the Territory."<br></blockquote>The reasons for this apparent conflict are&nbsp; found, not, perhaps, so much in the different ways in which different courts regard&nbsp; the&nbsp; general subject, as in the wording&nbsp; of the&nbsp; particular statutes under consideration,&nbsp; and&nbsp; in the fact that one who is called, for&nbsp; example, a clerk in one jurisdiction and performs therein a class&nbsp; of service which entitles him to that designation, will still&nbsp; be called a&nbsp; clerk in another jurisdiction, although he performs&nbsp; different&nbsp; or additional services.&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words,&nbsp; while his services&nbsp; in the former jurisdiction are purely those of a clerk, in the other they are a mixture of those of clerk and superintendent, or overseer or bookkeeper, or traveling salesman. This is a source&nbsp; of considerable&nbsp; confusion to&nbsp; one&nbsp; reading the decision hastily.<br><br>Moreover, in viewing the apparent&nbsp; discordance between the holdings of many of the courts above cited and those of Holy Trinity Church vs. United States and United States vs.&nbsp; Laws,&nbsp; <i>supra</i>,&nbsp; we must not overlook the fact that the rules of statutory&nbsp; construction and&nbsp; interpretation applicable to the statute under consideration in the case at bar are directly opposite&nbsp; to&nbsp; those applicable to the statutes interpreted and construed&nbsp; in the other cases.&nbsp;&nbsp; The statute now under consideration, being highly penal, must be construed with extreme strictness; while&nbsp; the statutes dealt with in the other cases,&nbsp; having for their object the giving of liens&nbsp; "to laborers and mechanic's for their work and labor," are to be liberally construed.<br><br>The courts are,&nbsp; however, substantially uniform in holding that, where the nature of the employment is essentially of superintendence or&nbsp; management, he who&nbsp; engages&nbsp; in that employment&nbsp; is not a laborer&nbsp; but&nbsp; a superintendent or manager&nbsp; and is not&nbsp; within the letter or the spirit&nbsp; of the Act.<br><br>The judgment of the court&nbsp; below is hereby reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial, without special finding as to the costs of this instance.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i> Arellano, C. J.,&nbsp; Torres, Mapa, </i>and <i>Carson, JJ</i>.,&nbsp; concur.<br></div>
