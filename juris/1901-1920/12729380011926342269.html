				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">A criminal compaint the municipal president in the justice of the peace court of the town of Tayug, Province of Pangasinan,. against Juan Ballesteros, parochial priest of the Roman Catholic church, in which it was alleged that the said Ballesteros closed the public street or road which runs in front of the church by placing gates&nbsp; where the said road enters and leaves the <i>atrio.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; The accused was arraigned on the same date and plead not guilty.<br><br>After the termination&nbsp; of the trial, the justice of the peace found the accused guilty as charged,&nbsp; and&nbsp; on the 7th of December, 1909, sentenced him to thirty days' imprisonment at hard labor in the municipal&nbsp; jail, and to pay a fine of P50 and&nbsp; the costs.&nbsp; He was further sentenced to remove the gates which he had erected at&nbsp; the said places.<br><br>The accused appealed&nbsp; to&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of First Instance, where he was again tried on the same charge, found guilty and sentenced on the 25th of February,&nbsp; 1910, to pay a fine of P25, to remove the said gates, and to pay the costs of the cause.&nbsp; Subsequently thereto,&nbsp; and on the 29th&nbsp; of March, 1910, Mgr.&nbsp; J. J. Carroll, Bishop of the Apostolic Roman Catholic Church,&nbsp; a&nbsp; unipersonal&nbsp; corporation, and&nbsp; the said Juan Ballesteros, as plaintiffs,&nbsp; instituted this action in this Supreme Court against the Honorable Isidro Paredes, judge of the Court of First Instance of the Province of Pangasinan, by filing a complaint in which they set up the said trials in the justice of the peace court and the&nbsp; Court of First Instance,&nbsp; and alleged that the defendant&nbsp; judge exceeded his jurisdiction in&nbsp; directing in his&nbsp; sentence that the said Juan Ballesteros remove the gates&nbsp; heretofore&nbsp; mentioned, for the reason that the said gates were placed on the property of the Roman&nbsp; Catholic Church&nbsp; and not upon a public highway, and that under the law the said Ballesteros could not appeal to this court; and there existing no other speedy and adequate remedy they therefore prayed that&nbsp; a preliminary injunction be issued out of this court,&nbsp; directed to the defendant judge, restraining him from carrying into effect that part of the said sentence&nbsp; which refers to the removal of the said gates; that upon hearing a writ of certiorari be issued, directing the record to be forwarded to this court for&nbsp; review, and after review of the same that judgment be rendered declaring that that part of the said sentence is null and&nbsp; void.&nbsp; The proper bond having been filed and approved,&nbsp; the&nbsp; vacation&nbsp; justice&nbsp; issued, on&nbsp; the same day, March&nbsp; 29,&nbsp; 1910, the preliminary&nbsp; injunction prayed&nbsp; for.<br><br>The record having been forwarded&nbsp; to this court in accordance with&nbsp; the&nbsp; law and&nbsp; the&nbsp; procedure in&nbsp; such cases, and&nbsp; the parties having been&nbsp; heard&nbsp; through their respective counsel, the case was submitted for final determination.<br><br>Counsel for&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiffs insist: First,&nbsp; that inasmuch as the question of&nbsp; title to real property was&nbsp; involved in the trial of this case before the justice of the peace,&nbsp; the said justice&nbsp; of&nbsp; the peace exceeded his jurisdiction proceeding with said trial and pronouncing judgment in the same;&nbsp; second,&nbsp; that&nbsp; as the justice&nbsp; of the peace had no jurisdiction to convict the defendant, Ballesteros, the Court of First Instance, on appeal, was without&nbsp; jurisdiction to try the&nbsp; case upon its merits; and, third, that if the Court of First Instance did acquire jurisdiction to try the case upon its merits, it exceeded its jurisdiction in condemning the said Ballesteros. to remove the gates in&nbsp; question.<br><br>The Attorney-General, representing the defendant judge, is of the opinion that both the justice of the peace and the Court of First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; had jurisdiction to determine the guilt of the accused and to impose the penalties complained of, including an order to remove the gates, inasmuch as the said Ballesteros closed or obstructed a public highway, it having been established that the said gates were&nbsp; placed across a street&nbsp; or&nbsp; highway&nbsp; in violation of law.<br><br>The validity of that part of the penalty of the defendant judge which refers to the fine imposed is not before us.<br><br>The ownership of the&nbsp; land where the said Juan&nbsp; Ballesteros placed the gates can not be determined at this time, but it is necessary to inquire whether&nbsp; or not the title to real property was involved in order to determine the jurisdiction, of&nbsp; the justice&nbsp; of the peace to convict the accused, Ballesteros.<br><br>The accused, Juan&nbsp; Ballesteros,&nbsp; testified in the&nbsp; justice of the peace court that before the 29th of September, 1909, the date on which the gates were erected, no&nbsp; one interfered with the free passage of vehicles, carts, and the public generally;&nbsp; but on&nbsp; being&nbsp; asked to whom that&nbsp; real&nbsp; property belonged he replied that it was the property of the Church; that he knew that the same was the property of the Church for the reason&nbsp; that the&nbsp; same was&nbsp; surrounded by&nbsp; a wall about one meter high, which wall inclosed the <span style="font-style: italic;">atrio</span> of the church, and that this Supreme Court having finally&nbsp; determined that&nbsp; the church building, convent, and <span style="font-style: italic;">atrio</span> are the property of the&nbsp; Roman Catholic Church, and he, Juan Ballesteros, having received instructions&nbsp; from the Bishop, erected&nbsp; the gates at those&nbsp; places, believing that he had authority&nbsp; to do&nbsp; so.&nbsp; This witness&nbsp; explained that at the places where the said&nbsp; gates were erected the walls had been torn&nbsp; down by usage almost&nbsp; level with the ground, and that it was at these two&nbsp; low places that the gates were erected.&nbsp; While&nbsp; this witness,&nbsp; Juan&nbsp; Ballesteros, admitted that the public passed freely to and fro through this passageway before the gates were erected,&nbsp; he did not concede or admit that the said&nbsp; land was public property, but strongly insisted that the same was the private property of the Church, basing this contention on the decision of this court and on the fact that the said property was inclosed by walls placed there by the Church.<br><br>According to a&nbsp; plan or rough&nbsp; draft&nbsp; of the premises, which is admitted by both the plaintiffs and the defendant to be substantially correct, it appears that the <span style="font-style: italic;">atrio</span> which, according to Juan Ballesteros, is inclosed by a wall, is just in front of&nbsp; the main entrance to&nbsp; the church on the south and joins the Church property.&nbsp; The&nbsp; road claimed to be a public highway by the defendant judge, and across which the gates were placed,&nbsp; passes entirely&nbsp; across the southern end of the said church, just&nbsp; in front of the main entrance, and according to this plan the said alleged public highway is about the same distance from the main&nbsp; entrance to the church as the said highway is wide.<br><br>The justice of the peace in his&nbsp; decision stated that the defense of the accused, Ballesteros, was that he was directed to place the gates there by his superior, the Bishop of Vigan. The justice of the peace in the same sentence found that the said real property&nbsp; belonged&nbsp; to&nbsp; the public and was under the&nbsp; exclusive control&nbsp; of the municipality,&nbsp; and&nbsp; further found that the public had acquired the same by prescription.<br><br>So it is clear from this record that a real question was raised in the justice of the&nbsp; peace court as to the ownerhip of this land.&nbsp; This&nbsp; was the&nbsp; real defense of the defendant.&nbsp; He did not deny having placed&nbsp; the gates there, but stated&nbsp; that&nbsp; he did so, believing that he was placing them&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the&nbsp; Church property.&nbsp;&nbsp; A&nbsp; mere allegation&nbsp; of ownership is not sufficient to oust a justice of the&nbsp; peace of jurisdiction, but when&nbsp; it develops during the trial from the proofs that the title to real property is necessarily involved as in this case,&nbsp; then&nbsp; the justice of the&nbsp; peace loses jurisdiction&nbsp; to try and determine the action.<br><blockquote>"A&nbsp; justice of the&nbsp; peace shall&nbsp; have no&nbsp; jurisdiction&nbsp; to adjudicate questions of title to real estate or any interest therein, and whenever a case requiring such adjudication is brought before him it shall be his duty, upon discovering the same, to suspend further proceedings therein and certify the cause forthwith to the Court of First Instance&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *." (Sec. 3, Act No. 1627.)<br></blockquote>A justice&nbsp; of the peace has&nbsp; no jurisdiction to deprive a ma of his real property by&nbsp; determining the title&nbsp; to the same.&nbsp;&nbsp; For better reasons&nbsp; he&nbsp; should not&nbsp; have jurisdiction to deprive a man of his liberty when, in order to&nbsp; do so, it is necessary for him to&nbsp; first determine the title to real property.<br><br>In the case at bar the justice of the peace had jurisdiction when the proceedings started&nbsp; in his court, but during the trial of the&nbsp; same&nbsp; he lost jurisdiction when&nbsp; the&nbsp; question of title to real property arose.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was then as completely without jurisdiction to proceed as if he had never acquired same.&nbsp;&nbsp; So the judgment rendered by the&nbsp; justice of the peace in this case was null and&nbsp; void for want of jurisdiction of the&nbsp; subject matter.<br><br>The&nbsp; defendant, Ballesteros, appealed to the Court of First Instance.&nbsp; The law governing&nbsp; appeals&nbsp; in&nbsp; criminal cases&nbsp; is as follows:<br><blockquote>"*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; The convicted party&nbsp; may appeal&nbsp; from any final judgment of a justice of the peace in a criminal cause to the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of First Instance by filing a notice of appeal with such justice within fifteen&nbsp; days after the entry of judgment. *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *."&nbsp; (Sec. 34, Act No.&nbsp; 1627.)<br><br>"All cases&nbsp; appealed from a justice's&nbsp; court shall&nbsp; be tried in all respects anew in the court to which the same are appealed; but on the hearing&nbsp; of such appeals it shall not be necessary,&nbsp; unless the appeal shall involve the constitutionality or legality of a statute, that a written record of the proceedings be kept; but&nbsp; shall&nbsp; be sufficient if the appellate court keeps a docket of&nbsp; the proceedings in the form prescribed in the next preceding section."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Sec. 54, General Orders, No. 58.)</blockquote>An&nbsp; appeal will not lie to the Supreme&nbsp; Court from a judgment of the Court of First Instance, tried&nbsp; on&nbsp; appeal, when the justice of the peace&nbsp; had&nbsp; jurisdiction, except in cases involving the validity or constitutionality of a statute or municipal ordinance.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Sec. 16 of Act No. 1627.)<br><br>Courts of First Instance have both original and appellate jurisdiction.&nbsp;&nbsp; They have&nbsp; jurisdiction of the person and of the subject matter in all cases on appeal from justices of the peace when properly brought before&nbsp; them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Appealed criminal cases "shall be tried in all respects anew."&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>De novo</i>, over again.&nbsp; The nature&nbsp; of the action&nbsp; can not be changed in the Court of First&nbsp; Instance,&nbsp; but&nbsp; must be tried <i>de novo</i> upon its merits on the same process&nbsp; and pleadings; that is, the process and pleadings must be&nbsp; of&nbsp; the same nature as those in the justice of the peace court. The prosecuting officer, however, can substitute his own complaint for that filed in the justice of the peace court, provided the nature of the action is not changed.&nbsp; In this jurisdiction no&nbsp; provision is made for an appeal from justice of the peace courts upon the law only, but all appeals are taken for a new trial, and the defendant is entitled to interpose the same&nbsp; objections as he could have&nbsp; interposed in the justice of the peace courts.<br><br>If the sentence imposed upon him by the justice of the peace is void for want&nbsp; of jurisdiction of the subject matter, the defendant, on appeal, has a&nbsp; right to have the appellate court so determine, or he may&nbsp; elect to have the Court of First Instance try the&nbsp; case upon its merits, without raising the question of the jurisdiction&nbsp; of the justice of&nbsp; the&nbsp; peace. If he raises no objection with reference to the jurisdiction of the justice of the peace and submits himself to&nbsp; be retried for the crime for which he&nbsp; was charged,&nbsp; then he will&nbsp; be presumed to have waived all questions&nbsp; as to jurisdiction, and he can not thereafter raise this question of jurisdiction, provided the appellate court had jurisdiction of his person and the subject matter.&nbsp;&nbsp; But&nbsp; should&nbsp; he&nbsp; make&nbsp; a&nbsp; timely objection in the appellate court as to the want or excess of jurisdiction of the justice of the peace, and should the court find such objection well founded, then it acquires jurisdiction only for the purpose of dismissing the same, without prejudice, however, to the institution of a new proceeding for the same criminal acts in the proper tribunal.&nbsp; But in order to take advantage of these rights&nbsp; the appellant must by proper objection call the attention of the court to these facts and give the court an opportunity to&nbsp; pass upon the validity of such sentence; otherwise he will be, as we have said, presumed to have waived the question of jurisdiction. No agreement of the parties,&nbsp; or waiver of objection,&nbsp; can confer jurisdiction&nbsp; on an appellate court&nbsp; which has&nbsp; no jurisdiction of the subject matter.&nbsp;&nbsp; But in the case at bar the&nbsp; Court of First Instance had jurisdiction, both of the person and of the subject matter.<br><br>In 24 Cyc, 641, it is said:<br><blockquote>"On appeal from a justice of the peace, the appellate court has&nbsp; only such jurisdiction as the justice&nbsp; had, and if he had no jurisdiction, the appellate court&nbsp; acquires none; and it is immaterial that such court has original&nbsp; jurisdiction&nbsp; of the subject matter of the action."</blockquote>A number of&nbsp; cases from various States in the American Union are cited&nbsp; in support of this proposition.&nbsp; It must be noted that this rule is based upon the theory that the appellate&nbsp; court&nbsp; had&nbsp; jurisdiction of&nbsp; the&nbsp; subject matter&nbsp; of&nbsp; the action.<br><br>On page 643 of the same volume (24 Cyc.)&nbsp; it is said:<br><blockquote>"While it&nbsp; has been held that, where&nbsp; the justice of the peace had no jurisdiction of the subject matter of an action, the&nbsp; parties&nbsp; can not&nbsp; confer jurisdiction on the&nbsp; appellate court by consent, the better view seems to be that where the appellate court has original as well&nbsp; as appellate jurisdiction of the cause, jurisdiction of both&nbsp; the subject matter and&nbsp; the&nbsp; person may be&nbsp; conferred&nbsp; upon it&nbsp; by waiver&nbsp; or consent.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Citing cases from Alabama,&nbsp; Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, and Ohio.)<br><br>"The question of want of jurisdiction may be raised&nbsp; by motion to dismiss the proceedings, or by objecting at the trial to the introduction of any evidence on&nbsp; behalf&nbsp; of plaintiff."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Id.)</blockquote>These propositions are applicable alike to both criminal and civil cases.<br><br>In the case at bar the accused, Ballesteros, made no objection whatever&nbsp; in the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First Instance to the&nbsp; trial being had upon its merits.&nbsp; He&nbsp; did not in any way call the attention of the Court of First Instance to the fact that the sentence imposed upon him by the justice of the peace was void for want of jurisdiction.&nbsp; We, therefore, conclude that he waived these questions and submitted&nbsp; himself to be retried for the crime charged upon the merits of the case.<br><br>That part of the sentence imposing a fine&nbsp; and costs upon Ballesteros is not questioned, but the validity of that&nbsp; part of the said sentence wherein Ballesteros was sentenced to remove the gates is before us for determination.<br><br>The law which gave the Court of First Instance jurisdiction of the subject matter is found in section 16 of Act No. 1511, which provides as follows:<br><blockquote>"It shall be unlawful&nbsp; for any&nbsp; person to convert any&nbsp; part of any public highway, bridge,&nbsp; wharf, or trail to his&nbsp; own private use,&nbsp; or to&nbsp; obstruct&nbsp; or&nbsp; damage&nbsp; the same&nbsp; in&nbsp; any manner, or to remove any&nbsp; tool or road making material therefrom, or to mutilate, damage, destroy, or in any manner interfere with any&nbsp; public bridge, culvert, or drainage canal,&nbsp; or to use any public&nbsp; ditch for irrigation or other private purposes, and any person so offending shall be punished by a line&nbsp; of not more than one hundred pesos, or by imprisonment at hard labor not exceeding&nbsp; three months, or by&nbsp; both such fine&nbsp; and imprisonment, in the discretion of the court.&nbsp; The provisions of this section shall likewise be applicable to highways, bridges, wharves, and trails in provinces organized under Act Numbered Thirteen hundred and&nbsp; ninety-six, notwithstanding the limitations contained in sections one to six of this Act."<br></blockquote>Nothing is said in this section, nor anywhere else in the Act, about the removal of the obstructions.&nbsp; Our attention has not been called to any&nbsp; other provision of law on this subject, except paragraph 6&nbsp; of article 584 of the Penal Code, which provides that -<br><blockquote>"Those who shall&nbsp; obstruct the&nbsp; sidewalks, streets, and public places by their acts or with wares of any kind shall be punished with&nbsp; the penalty of a fine of from fifteen to one hundred and twenty-five pesetas or censure."<br></blockquote>The above article of the Penal Code makes no provision for the removal of the obstruction.<br><br>The crimes defined and punished by section 16 of Act No, 1511,&nbsp; <i>supra,</i>&nbsp; are known in&nbsp; American jurisprudence as "public nuisances."&nbsp; A public nuisance is a common law offense, and its creation or maintenance&nbsp; is, in the United States, an indictable offense, both at common law and under the statutes of the various States (29&nbsp; Cyc, 1278).&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; the various States there are found numerous statutes providing for the punishment or the imposition of penalties oh persons creating or maintaining: nuisances,&nbsp; which do not, however, supersede the common law,&nbsp; where&nbsp; they do not attempt to cover all cases&nbsp; of public nuisances.&nbsp; Such statutes are construed according to the general rules for the construction of. penal statutes,&nbsp; (29 Cyc, 1279, and cases cited.)<br><br>Notwithstanding the fact that section 16 of Act No. 1511, supra, makes no provision for the removal of obstructions, the Attorney-General insists that the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of First&nbsp; Instance had jurisdiction to condemn the defendant, Ballesteros,&nbsp; to remove the gates&nbsp; in question in this&nbsp; case.&nbsp; In support of this proposition he calls the&nbsp; court's attention to the cases of Barclay <i>vs.</i> Commonwealth&nbsp; (25 Pa. St., 503)., Wetmore <i>vs</i>. Tracy (14&nbsp; Wend., 250),&nbsp; Lancaster Turnpike Co.,<i> vs</i>. Rogers (2 Pa. St., 114), and sections 828 and 829 of Bishop's Work on Criminal Law, eighth edition.<br><br>The case of Barclay <i>vs.</i> Commonwealth,<i> supra,</i>&nbsp; is based on Taggart's case (21 Pa. St., 527).&nbsp; In this latter case the charge on which the defendant was convicted was based on the common-law offense, "a nuisance in the King's highway," The defendant was sentenced to abate the nuisance at his own costs.&nbsp; The court said, among other things, that -<br><blockquote>"Where the indictment is at common law, as this was, we know of no decision that such a sentence&nbsp; is illegal."</blockquote>That part of section 828 of Bishop's New Criminal Law, <i>supra</i>, which refers to the abatement of&nbsp; nuisances, says:<br><blockquote>"Whenever a subject&nbsp; of property,&nbsp; whether through its owner's fault or not, is in a situation to be a nuisance, it is not strictly forfeited,&nbsp; but&nbsp; the nuisance may&nbsp; be abated,&nbsp; to the destruction, if necessary, of the property."<br></blockquote>Under No. 2 of section 821&nbsp; of this same work on criminal law several cases are cited in support of this doctrine, one of which is the case&nbsp; of&nbsp; Lancaster <i>vs.</i> Rogers,<i> supra.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; On examination of&nbsp; these cases, as well as those&nbsp; cited by the Attorney-General, <i>supra, </i>it will be seen that they were either based on the&nbsp; common law, or on&nbsp; statutes which did not exclude the common-law&nbsp; remedies.<br><br>Some of the courts in the United States&nbsp; hold that the right to abate a public nuisance is not affected by statutes imposing a penalty for the offense,&nbsp; unless the negative words are used, evincing an intent to exclude the common-law remedies (29 Cyc., 1279).&nbsp; That is, where the statute makes a.public nuisance a crime or misdemeanor, providing a penalty for the violation of&nbsp; the same,&nbsp; but makes no provision for the abatement or&nbsp; removal of the obstruction, and&nbsp; where the wording of&nbsp; the&nbsp; statute does&nbsp; not clearly&nbsp; show that it was the intention to&nbsp; exclude&nbsp; the common-law remedies, one of which is the removal of the obstruction, then such common law remedies can be applied, upon the theory that the common law is in force in the United States.<br><blockquote>"But&nbsp; neither English&nbsp; nor&nbsp; American common law is in force in these&nbsp; Islands,&nbsp; nor&nbsp; are the doctrines derived therefrom binding upon our courts, save only in so far as they are founded on sound principles, applicable to local conditions, and are not in conflict with existing law;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *" (U. S. <i>vs</i>. Cuna, 12 Phil. Rep., 241.)<br></blockquote>Articles 1 and 21 of the Penal Code are as follows:<br><blockquote>"Art. 1.&nbsp; Crimes or misdemeanors are&nbsp; voluntary acts or omissions punished by law.<br><br>"Art. 21. No crime&nbsp; or misdemeanor shall be punished by a penalty which was not established by law prior to its commission."</blockquote>So&nbsp; to hold&nbsp; that the&nbsp; common-law&nbsp; remedies&nbsp; in&nbsp; cases of public nuisances apply in this country would be contrary to these express&nbsp; provisions.&nbsp;&nbsp; The civil&nbsp; law is in force in this jurisdiction&nbsp; and all penalties imposed for crimes or misdemeanors must be&nbsp; provided for by statute, and a penalty which is not so provided is without&nbsp; the jurisdiction&nbsp; of the courts and null and void.<br><br>In the case&nbsp; at bar the Court of First Instance sentenced the defendant, Ballesteros, to remove the gates&nbsp; in question, thereby&nbsp; imposing&nbsp; a penalty which&nbsp; was unauthorized by statute.&nbsp; Should an attempt have been made to&nbsp; execute this part of the sentence and should Ballesteros have refused to remove&nbsp; the gates, and should the court have imprisoned him until&nbsp;&nbsp; he complied&nbsp; with&nbsp; that part of&nbsp; the sentence, such imprisonment would&nbsp; have been&nbsp; illegal. The said defendant. was without jurisdiction to condemn the&nbsp; said Ballesteros to remove the gates in question, and that part&nbsp; of the is null and void.<br><br>A&nbsp; party&nbsp; entitled to&nbsp; appeal,&nbsp; or to pursue&nbsp; some other remedy, who has lost the right, through inadvertence, accident or mistake,&nbsp; may have a&nbsp; remedy by certiorari, on a showing of probable merits and freedom from fault.&nbsp; (6 Cyc, 763, and cases from Alabama, Arkansas, District of Columbia, Mississippi, North&nbsp; Carolina, Oregon, and Tennessee.)<br><br>In the case at bar Ballesteros could have appealed to this court from the decision of the Court of First Instance, as the justice of&nbsp; the peace had no jurisdiction to try the&nbsp; case and impose the penalties,&nbsp; but his failure to appeal was not through any neglect or fault of his, as he honestly believed that in view of the provisions of section 16 of Act No. 1627, supra, he could not appeal.&nbsp; Under these circumstances he is clearly entitled to the remedy of certiorari.<br><br>So we conclude:<br><ol><li>That a justice of the peace has no jurisdiction&nbsp; to try and determine any case, either&nbsp; criminal or civil, where the title to real property is necessarily involved, and when such a case comes before him he should immediately certify it to the Court of First Instance;<br><br></li><li>That in a&nbsp; criminal case where a justice of the peace renders a judgment wherein he does not have jurisdiction of the person of the defendant and the subject matter of the action, and an appeal is taken to the Court of First Instance, and no objection is interposed&nbsp; in the said Court of First Instance as to the&nbsp; jurisdiction of the justice of the&nbsp; peace, then the&nbsp; defendant will be presumed to&nbsp; have waived all objections to such&nbsp; jurisdiction&nbsp; and the case can be tried upon its merits; provided, however, that the&nbsp; nature of the action is&nbsp; not changed&nbsp; and that&nbsp; the said&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of First Instance had jurisdiction of the subject matter of the action; but when a timely&nbsp; objection is made to&nbsp; the jurisdiction of the appellate court&nbsp; (Court of First Instance) to try such case on its merits, the said court only acquires jurisdiction to dismiss the case; and,<br><br></li><li>That under existing law the courts have no jurisdiction to impose, as a&nbsp; part of the penalty in a criminal action,&nbsp; a sentence condemning the defendant to abate the nuisance when convicted for having violated the provisions of Act No. 1511.</li></ol>Let judgment be entered declaring that part of the sentence imposed upon the said Ballesteros, condemning him to remove the gates in question, null and void, and that the preliminary injunction heretofore issued be made perpetual, without any&nbsp; special ruling&nbsp; as to costs.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J.,&nbsp; Torres, Johnson</i>, and&nbsp; <i>Moreland, JJ</i>., concur.<br></div>
