				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On the 10th day of November, 1904, the petitioners filed a petition in the Court  of Land Registration  for  the registration of a parcel of land situated in Calle Barredo, district of Malate, in the city of Manila, together with the house  erected thereon, bearing  the  Government police number 20, a  more particular  description of which  land is contained in the second paragraph of said petition.</p>
<p>The petitioners claim that they  had acquired the property  in question by purchase from Narciso Mayuga y Bautista, Felix Bautista y Ongjungco, Teodorico Bautista  y Ongjungco, Sebastian  Santos y Rodriguez,  and  Vicente Albert y Mayoralgo, which purchase was evidenced by  a document attached to the  petition in said cause, which document has  not  been registered.</p>
<p>The respondents appeared, opposed the said registration, and  alleged that the  property  in  question  had  been the property of Julian Punsalan,  who had given the same in guaranty to  Teodorico Bautista. upon  condition  that the same should be redeemed after his death; that the said Julian Punsalan was the father of  the present respondents and  died on the 15th day of December, 1890, in  the city of Manila, his  wife  and the  legitimate mother of  the respondents being Eufemia Concepcion, who died on the 27th day  of February, 1881; that the respondents have never conveyed in  any manner, to any person, the ownership  of the said parcel  or lot of land, and that in or about the  years 1893, 1894,  and 1895, as  regards  Teodorico Bautista, and  after said dates in the years 1901 and 1904, as regards Narciso Mayuga, they had repeatedly  made efforts to redeem the lands given in guaranty, as aforesaid, and at all times have been and are now ready to redeem the same.</p>
<p>On the 3d day  of January, 1906, after hearing the evidence adduced by the respective parties, the judge  of the Court of Land Registration rendered a decision in favor of the petitioners and against the respondents, basing the same upon  the following facts:</p>
<p>First. That the petitioners, together with their brother, Vicente Albert y  Mayoralgo, purchased the land in question from Narciso Mayuga,  Felix  Bautista y Ongjungco, Teodorico  Bautista y Ongjungco,  and  Julia Bautista  y Ongjungco,  who,  in  their capacity as  heirs,  judicially declared as such, acquired the lands in question  by  virtue of  the  fact that  their  uncle,  the presbyter,  Teodorico Bautista, had died intestate.</p>
<p>Second. That Vicente Albert y  Mayoralgo sold  to his two sisters his interest  in  said  land,  as  appears by  a written document attached to the record in said cause.</p>
<p>Third. That the land in question in the year  1879, was delivered  by Julian Funsalan, the father of the present respondents in consideration of the sum of 130  pesos, to Father Teodorico Bautista, who during his lifetime enjoyed the possession  thereof up to the time of his death,  which occurred in the year 1895.</p>
<p>The contract under which the petitioners claim their right to the land in question, and the one by which Julian Punsalan delivered the land  in question to  Father Teodorico Bautista, was in words and figures as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"I, Don Gavino Visco, present gobernadorcillo of Malate, Province of Manila, under appointment by  the GovernorGeneral, acting in concert, etc., do hereby certify that on this date there appeared before me the presbyter, Don Teodorico Bautista,  and Don Julian Punsalan,  a native, married, of age, and a principal  in this town;  the first named asks, in order that it may serve him as a legal document, that the latter be questioned whether or not it is true that lie had mortgaged to the petitioner, on paeto de retro for the sum of one hundred and thirty-four pesos, two parcels of land situated in the barrio of San  Roque, within the jurisdiction of this  town, the area and description whereof are contained in the title  deeds annexed hereto, upon condition that the same shall be redeemed after the death of the respondent, and should the statement be true, that  the original  papers be handed to  the petitioner. Agreeably to such petition, I questioned Don Julian along the  lines above  set  forth  by Don  Teodorico  Bautista. [The respondent]  upon being informed through the interpretation of one of my assistants, stated that all the points on which he was  questioned were true and correct, and that  he himself  engaged to punctually  and faithfully comply with what had  been  stipulated, and for such purpose the laws in connection with this matter were referred to.</p>
  <p>"In witness whereof, this certificate is issued and signed by me together with the above-mentioned witnesses, excepting Don Julian Punsalan, who,  being illiterate, his name was signed at his request by Don Cirilo Unalubia, at this casa-tribunal  of Malate, on  this the eighteenth day  of October, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-nine."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only question presented  in the present  case  is whether or not the above contract between Julian Punsalan and Father Teodorico Bautista was a pacto de retro, and, if it is a pacto de retro, then the question arises, Did Julian Punsalan or his .heirs repurchase or attempt to repurchase the same within the time prescribed by law?</p>
<p>A  reading  of the above-quoted contract shows  that the parties  themselves  denominated said  contract as a pacto de retro "upon condition that the same shall be redeemed after the death of the respondent," and we are of the opinion, and so hold, that the same contract is a pacto  de retro.</p>
<p>Said  contract was executed and delivered on the 18th day  of  October, 1879.   Father  Teodorico  Bautista died in the year 1895.   Julian Punsalan died in the year 1890, after the provisions of the Civil  Code became operative  in the Philippine Islands; therefore the provisions of the Civil  Code relating to  the  time within which land sold under a pacto de retro  can be repurchased by the vendor applied to said contract, according to paragraph  4 of the transitory  provisions of said code.   (Art.  1976,  Civil Code,)   The Civil Code  became operative in the Philippine Islands  in the  year 1889.   Article  1508 of  said code provides:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The right referred to in the preceding article [the right to repurchase a thing sold], in the absence of an express agreement, shall last four years, counted  from the date of the contract.</p>
  <p>"Should there be  an agreement, the period shall  not exceed ten years."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Article1 1500 of said code provides:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"If the vendor should not comply with the provisions of article 1518, the vendee shall irrevocably acquire the ownership of the thing sold."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Article 1518 provides:</p>
<p>"The vendor can not exercise the, right  of redemption without returning to  the vendee the price of the sale, and, furthermore:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"(1)  The expenses of the contract and any other legitimate payment made by reason of the  sale.</p>
  <p>" (2)  The useful and necessary expenses incurred by the thing sold."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The original parties to said contract not  having fixed  a definite time within  which  the vendor might repurchase the land in question, the law fixed the time for them at four years; or if it may be considered that the death of the purchaser under the said contract was a .definite time, then the period of ten years fixed by the statute had also expired before any attempt on the part of the vendor or his heirs for the repurchase of  the land in question had been  made, or any attempt to comply with the provisions of said article 1509 or 1518.   (See par. 4 of the transitory provisions of the Civil Code and art. 1939 of the same code.)</p>
<p>The lower court  found that the heirs and successors in interest of the original vendor, Julian Punsalan, had  not repurchased the land within the time prescribed by law, and that therefore the title to the land became absolute in Father Teodorico Bautista and his heirs and successors in interest.   (Espafia vs. Lucido,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>   5 Off. Gaz., 550; Garcia vs. Dianiflon,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 5 Off. Gaz., 536.)</p>
<p>A careful examination of the record brought to this court fully justified the  conclusions  of the lower court.  The judgment of  the lower  court is  therefore hereby affirmed, with costs.    So ordered.</p>
