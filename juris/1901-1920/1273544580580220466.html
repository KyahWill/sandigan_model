				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This was a petition for the writ of habeas corpus.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its purpose was to secure the liberty of the plaintiff.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time of the presentation of the petition, the plaintiff was being held by the Collector of Customs for deportation.<br><br>It appears from the record that the&nbsp; plaintiff is a Chinese person,&nbsp; thirty-nine years&nbsp; of&nbsp; age; that&nbsp; he was a&nbsp; laborer, that he had resided in the&nbsp; Philippine Islands for some time prior&nbsp; to the 17th of April, 1912; that on the 17th of April, 1912,&nbsp; he&nbsp; obtained&nbsp; a Chinese&nbsp; laborer's&nbsp; return&nbsp; certificate, No. 7374; that on or about the 21st of April, 1912, he left the Philippine Islands, on the steamship <span style="font-style: italic;">Rubi&nbsp; </span>for&nbsp; China; that on&nbsp; or about&nbsp; the 18th of April, 1913, his original Chinese laborer's return&nbsp; certificate was extended&nbsp; by the acting American&nbsp; consul at Amoy, China; that later, on the 3d of&nbsp; December, 1913, said certificate was further extended until the 3d of February, 1914, as shown by the indorsement thereon; that said certificates were&nbsp; extended by reason of the sickness of the&nbsp; plaintiff; that a further physical examination of the plaintiff was had on or about the 3d or 4th of March, 1914, and he was again advised to see a&nbsp; doctor. No further extension of&nbsp; his certificate seems to have been made.&nbsp; He arrived&nbsp; at the port of Manila on the steamship <span style="font-style: italic;">Taisang </span>on the 18th of June,&nbsp; 1914, and&nbsp; asked&nbsp; permission to land.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was refused&nbsp; landing for the&nbsp; reason&nbsp; that&nbsp; he had&nbsp; not returned&nbsp; to the&nbsp; Philippine&nbsp; Islands&nbsp; within one year from the date of his original certificate (the 17th of April, 1912) nor within one year thereafter under an extension by the American consul at&nbsp; Amoy, or by&nbsp; any other authority of the United States.<br><br>Upon the foregoing facts the board of special inquiry denied&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellant the right to enter the Philippine&nbsp; Islands.&nbsp; An appeal from that decision was&nbsp; taken to the Collector of Customs and affirmed by him.&nbsp; Thereupon the plaintiff presented a petition for the writ of habeas corpus in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila.<br><br>After hearing the evidence, the Honorable Simplicio&nbsp; del Rosario, in a carefully prepared opinion, reached the conclusion that there was not sufficient evidence to justify the reversal or modification of the conclusion of the Collector of Customs.&nbsp; From that decision the appellant appealed to this court and made several assignments of error.<br><br>With reference to the first assignment of error, this court has&nbsp; decided in numerous cases contrary to the contention of&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellant. This court has&nbsp; decided:&nbsp; first,&nbsp; that the Solicitor-General of the Philippine Islands, in his official capacity, has a perfect right to represent the officials of the Insular Government,&nbsp; in courts of record, and that he has a right to make a return to a writ&nbsp; directed to the Insular Collector of Customs, by virtue of&nbsp; his official duties; and second, we have&nbsp; frequently&nbsp; decided also that the board of special inquiry, in relation&nbsp; with the&nbsp; Insular Collector of Customs, has a right to determine, under the Chinese exclusion laws, in the first instance, what Chinamen may enter the Philippine Islands.<br><br>The appellant discusses&nbsp; his 3d,&nbsp; 4th, 5th&nbsp; and&nbsp; 6th assignments of error together.&nbsp; These assignments of error present the&nbsp; question whether a Chinese laborer, who leaves the Philippine Islands with a&nbsp; Chinese laborer's return certificate, may return after the expiration of two years.<br><br>The petitioner herein was&nbsp; granted a Chinese laborer's return certificate on the&nbsp; 17th of April, 1912, authorizing him to visit&nbsp; China for a period of one year.&nbsp; Said certificate was issued in accordance with&nbsp; the provisions of section 7 of the Act&nbsp; of&nbsp; Congress&nbsp; of September&nbsp; 13, 1888, as amended by the Act of Congress of the 29th of April, 1902.&nbsp; Said Act of Congress of the 13th of Sept., 1888, in part provides as follows: "The right to&nbsp; return under the said certificate (Chinese laborer's return certificate) shall be limited to <span style="font-style: italic;">one year;</span> but it may be extended for an additional period,<span style="font-style: italic;"> not to exceed a year,</span> in cases&nbsp; where, by reason&nbsp; of sickness or other cause&nbsp; of&nbsp; disability&nbsp; beyond his control, the holder thereof shall be rendered&nbsp; unable sooner to&nbsp; return, which facts shall be fully reported to and investigated by the consular&nbsp; representative of&nbsp; the&nbsp; United&nbsp; States at the port or place&nbsp; from&nbsp; which such laborer&nbsp; departs for the&nbsp; United States,&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; and no&nbsp; Chinese laborer shall be permitted to reenter the United&nbsp; States without producing to the proper officer of the customs at the port of such entry the return certificate herein required."<br><br>This provision of the Act of Congress of the 29th of April, 1902,&nbsp; (Sept.&nbsp; 13, 1888) was adopted by the Congress of the United States, in conformity with article 2 of the treaty between the United States and China, of March 17,1894.&nbsp; Art. 2 of said treaty, among other things, provides: " (first)&nbsp; and such right of return to the United States shall be exercised within one year from the date of leaving the United States; but such right&nbsp; of&nbsp; return to&nbsp; the United States may be extended for an additional period, <span style="font-style: italic;">not to exceed&nbsp; one&nbsp; year</span>, in cases&nbsp; where&nbsp; by reason of sickness or other cause&nbsp; of&nbsp; disability beyond&nbsp; his control, such Chinese&nbsp; laborer shall be rendered unable sooner to returnâ€”which facts shall be fully reported to the Chinese consul at the port of departure,&nbsp; and by him certified, to the satisfaction of the collector of the port at which such Chinese subject shall&nbsp; land in the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp; And no such Chinese laborer (those with Chinese laborer's return certificate) shall be permitted to enter the United&nbsp; States by land&nbsp; or sea without&nbsp; producing to&nbsp; the proper officer of the customs the return certificate herein required."<br><br>In the present case no contention is made that the appellant returned to the Philippine Islands within the year immediately&nbsp; following the&nbsp; date&nbsp; of his&nbsp; return certificate; neither is it contended that he&nbsp; returned within the additional&nbsp; period of one year which had&nbsp; been granted to him by the consular representative of the United States at the port or place from which he had departed for&nbsp; the United States or territory thereof.<br><br>The Supreme Court of the United States, as&nbsp; well as the Federal courts, has frequently decided that Chinese aliens are not permitted to enter territory&nbsp; of&nbsp; the United States unless they&nbsp; have complied strictly with the law.&nbsp; The law provides that Chinese aliens shall not&nbsp; be&nbsp; permitted to enter territory of the United States&nbsp; without what&nbsp; is known as the "section six certificate."&nbsp; If they are not possessed of said certificate they cannot enter and they will&nbsp; not be permitted to present any proof as a substitute therefor.&nbsp;&nbsp; We think the doctrine which has been repeatedly&nbsp; announced relating&nbsp; to the "section six certificate," may equally well be&nbsp; applied to&nbsp; the provisions&nbsp; of the law relating&nbsp; to the Chinese laborer's&nbsp; return&nbsp; certificate.&nbsp;&nbsp; The law seems to be mandatory.&nbsp;&nbsp; It provides that the certificate shall be limited to one year, and for an extension of an additional period "not to exceed a&nbsp; year."&nbsp;&nbsp; The plaintiff herein&nbsp; not having returned within the year after his first certificate, and not having returned within&nbsp; the period of a year&nbsp; thereafter, we find&nbsp; no reason now&nbsp; for reversing&nbsp; or&nbsp; modifying the decision of the&nbsp; lower court.&nbsp; The same is, therefore, hereby affirmed, with&nbsp; costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Arellano,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J.,&nbsp; Torres, Carson,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Araullo, JJ.,</span> concur.<br></div>
