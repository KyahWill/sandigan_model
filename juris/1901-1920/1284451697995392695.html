				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. FAUSTINO CORTES Y MACASAIT, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.

				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This case has come to us on appeal from a judgment of the Court of First 
Instance of the city of Manila whereby Faustino Cortes was convicted of the 
crime of homicide and sentenced to the penalty of 14 years 8 months and one day 
of <em>reclusion temporal</em> with its accessory penalties, to indemnify the 
heirs of Pablo Montevirgen in the sum of P1,000 and to pay the costs.
<p>The facts are as follows: Faustino Cortes who had been living in concubinage 
with Marciana Bozmente separated from her three days before the crime, left the 
house they had been occupying and went to live in another one nearby. In front 
of said second house, on the night of August 21, 1916, the woman Bozmente and 
her son Pablo Montevirgen appeared and roundly insulted the defendant, after 
which Montevirgen challenged him to come down into the street. Cortes came down 
and there a struggle of diverse success took place between him and Montevirgen 
until Cortes, having overpowered his antagonist, was seen to get up his right 
hand covered with blood and his left grasping a fan knife. Montevirgen also got 
up, dragged himself along very painfully until finally he collapsed, fell down 
and shortly afterwards died unconscious. Deceased had a deep wound in the base 
of the neck from which blood flowed in abundance. "The cause of death," says the 
medical certificate, "was a hemorrhage produced by a wound in the right carotid 
artery and in the inner jugular vein. The body bore seven other wounds 
also."</p>
<p>Faustino Cortes was charged with the commission of the crime of homicide and 
after hearing the witnesses, most of them eyewitnesses, the court was convinced 
of his guilt wherefore it sentenced him for said crime, committed with neither 
extenuating nor aggravating circumstances, to the penalty aforestated.</p>
<p>The defendant appealed and, in this second instance, alleged that the trial 
court erred in not taking account, for the purpose of reducing the penalty, of 
the extenuating circumstance of immediate provocation.</p>
<p>The appellant is right in this contention; but the provocation should not be 
estimated according to the statement of facts made by appellant, to wit, that 
Marciana Bozmente went up into his house and while he was asleep, struck him in 
the face with her sabot or wooden shoe, and, when he awoke, caught hold of his 
shirt bosom and tried to drag Him outside, saying "Come here! It's your hour 
now." That testimony not only is not corroborated but also conflicts with other 
testimony declaring that the Bozmente woman did not move from the street from 
whence she insulted the defendantâ€”it does not appear that she entered the 
house.</p>
<p>The proof of immediate provocation is found in the testimony of the witness 
for the prosecution Joaquin Bas, an eyewitness from its beginning, truthful and 
impartial, as shown by other testimony. He told of the insults uttered by the 
mother and son in front of the defendant's room; he saw upon the deceased's 
challenge, the defendant come down from his house; and he witnessed the struggle 
in all its vicissitudes. Without those insults and threats the defendant would 
not have come down and the struggle would not have taken place.</p>
<p>Moreover the appellant alleges that the trial judge erred also in not giving 
due weight to the extenuating circumstance of unlawful aggression.</p>
<p>In respect to this point the lower court did not err. It is already a 
well-settled rule, firmly established in many decisions interpretative of 
article 8 of the Penal Code, that, after the accused accepts a challenge, 
thereby placing himself in an unlawful status and one of force, the prior 
aggression of his opponent, which, as it was not unexpected, could not catch him 
off his guard, excludes the condition of lawful defense, for the challenge by 
itself excludes the classification of self-defense that, totally or partially, 
exempts from liability (decision by the supreme court of Spain, of March 8, 
1897); or, as set forth in another decision by the same court (that of February 
6, 1899), the right of lawful self-defense cannot validly be set up in behalf of 
a person who voluntarily exposes his person to the consequences of a hand to 
hand struggle with his adversary in which, for the reason that each of the 
combatants has no other intention than to injure the other, the first act of 
force, come from whichever of the two it may, cannot be held but to be an 
accident of the fight itself and in nowise whatever as an unwarranted and 
unexpected aggression which alone can legalize self-defense.</p>
<p>Taking into consideration the extenuating circumstance defined in paragraph 4 
of article 9 of the Penal Code, the penalty should be imposed in the minimum 
degree.</p>
<p>With the understanding, therefore, that the penalty imposed of <em>reclusion 
temporal</em> shall be 12 years and one day of imprisonment, the judgment 
appealed from is in all other respects affirmed and the costs of this instance 
shall be against the appellant. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Johnson, Carson, Araullo, Street</em>, and <em>Malcolm, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p></div>
