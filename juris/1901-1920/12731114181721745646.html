				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The defendant was charged in the Municipal Court of the city of Manila with 
the crime of theft. He was found guilty of the lesser crime of frustrated theft. 
He appealed to the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila and again he 
was found guilty of the crime of frustrated theft, and was sentenced to pay a 
fine of P100, with subsidiary
<p>The sole error assigned on appeal is that the lower court erred in holding 
that the defendant was guilty of the crime of theft as disclosed by the facts 
appearing of record. We have examined the evidence carefully and from our study 
are unable to say that the proof is contrary to the findings of the lower court. 
Stated in one sentence, the defendant, Tomas Adiao, a customs inspector, 
abstracted a leather belt valued at P0.80, from the baggage of a Japanese named 
T. Murakami, and secreted the belt in his desk in the Custom House, where it was 
found by other customs employees.</p>
<p>Based on these facts, the Court is of the opinion that the crime can not 
properly be classified as frustrated, as this word is defined in article 3 of 
the Penal Code, but that since the offender performed all of the acts of 
execution necessary for the accomplishment of the felony, he is guilty of the 
consummated crime of theft. The fact that the defendant was under observation 
during the entire transaction and that he was unable to get the merchandise out 
of the Custom House, is not decisive; all the elements of the completed crime of 
theft are present. The following decisions of the supreme court of Spain are in 
point:</p>
<p>"The defendant was charged with the theft of some fruit from the land of 
another. As he was in the act of taking the fruit he was seen by a policeman, 
yet it did not appear that he was at that moment caught by the policeman but 
sometime later. The court said: "* * * The trial court did not err * * * in 
considering the crime as that of consummated theft instead of frustrated theft 
inasmuch as nothing appears in the record showing that the policemen who saw the 
accused take the fruit from the adjoining land arrested him in the act and thus 
prevented him from taking full possession of the thing stolen and even its 
utilization by him for an interval of time." (Decision of the supreme court of 
Spain, October 14, 1898.)</p>
<p>Defendant picked the pocket of the offended party while the latter was 
hearing mass in a church. The latter on account of the solemnity of the act, 
although noticing the theft, did not do anything to prevent it. Subsequently, 
however, while the defendant was still inside the church, the offended party got 
back the money from the defendant. The court .said that the defendant had 
performed all the acts of execution and considered the theft as consummated. 
(Decision of the supreme court of Spain, December 1, 1897.)</p>
<p>The defendant penetrated into a room of a certain house and by means of a key 
opened up a case, and from the case took a small box, which was also opened with 
a key, from which in turn he took a purse containing 461 <em>reales</em> and 20 
<em>centimos</em>, and then he placed the money over the cover of the case; just 
at this moment he was caught by two guards who were stationed in another room 
near-by. The court considered this as consummated robbery, and said: "* * * The 
accused * * * having materially taken possession of the money from the moment he 
took it from the place where it had been, and having taken it with his hands 
with intent to appropriate the same, he executed all the acts necessary to 
constitute the crime which was thereby produced; only the act of making use of 
the thing having been frustrated, which, however, does not go to make the 
elements of the consummated crime." (Decision of the supreme court of Spain, 
June 13, 1882.)</p>
<p>There exists the aggravating circumstance that advantage was taken by the 
offender of his public position. Wherefore, in view of the provisions of 
articles 517 and 518, No. 5, of the Penal Code, and there being present one 
aggravating circumstance compensated by no mitigating circumstance, the penalty 
must be imposed in the maximum degree.</p>
<p>Judgment is reversed and the defendant and appellant is sentenced to three 
months and one day of <em>arresto mayor,</em> with the costs of all instances 
against him. The merchandise in question, attached to the record as Exhibit A, 
shall be returned to the lawful owner, T. Murakami. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Johnson, Street, Avance√±a</em>, and <em>Fisher, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p></div>
