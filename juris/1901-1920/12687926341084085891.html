				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The prayer of; the complaint in this action is that certain lands therein 
described, now in the possession of the defendant municipality, be "declared to 
be the property of the plaintiff" and that "the defendant be ordered to deliver 
these lands to the plaintiff."
<p>In support of his contentions plaintiff relies wholly and exclusively on a 
single document (Exhibit A), read together with the testimony of a single 
witness. No other evidence was offered in support of the allegations of the 
complaint.</p>
<p>Exhibit A is, in the language of the trial judge, "a certificate issued by 
the provincial fiscal of Ilocos Sur, in his capacity of register of deeds of the 
Province of Ilocos Sur, wherein it is set forth that the Church of Bantay, 
Ilocos Sur, then represented by its former parish priest, applied for a 
possessory information of the properties in question and in the proceedings had 
for the purpose proved the possession of the Church of Bantay, Ilocos Sur, now 
the plaintiff, over the said properties for a period of more than thirty years, 
in which proceedings record was also made of the encumbrances that bear on the 
real estate mentioned and which are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(1) That the church, the initiator of these proceedings, shall never sell, 
mortgage, or alienate the properties without the knowledge and consent of the 
residents of the pueblo of Bantay, who donated them to the said church; (2) that 
the usufruct of the said lands shall, upon payment of rent, or canon, always 
pertain to the residents of the pueblo of Bantay; (3) that the administration of 
the properties shall always lie with the parish priest of the church of the said 
pueblo; and, (4) that, when the municipality has not sufficient revenue to meet 
its required expenditures, an amount not exceeding P200 may be expended for this 
purpose from the income of the said land.</p>
<p>"On April 18, 1895, the parcels above mentioned, together with the charges on 
each of them, were recorded in the property registry of the Province of Ilocos 
Sur, section of the pueblo of Bantay, by virtue of the said possessory 
information."</p></blockquote>
<p>It nowhere, appears that the defendant municipality was cited to appear, or 
did in fact appear in the course of the proceedings.</p>
<p>The single witness called on behalf of the plaintiff testified substantially 
as follows: That he was a clerk (escribiente) of the Church at Bantay; that he 
had formerly been one of the headmen (principalia) of the municipality of 
Bantay; that formerly the lands in question were owned by the citizens of Bantay 
administered by the headmen (principalia) of that municipality; that thereafter 
the headmen of the town donated the land in question to the Church of Bantay; 
that although he himself signed the document donating the land he could not say 
when it was executed; that the parish priest at one time was administrator of 
the land in question, but he was not able to say when or under what conditions; 
that he knew that this was so, because in the performance of his duties as a 
clerk of the church, he remembered having helped to store the crops from these 
lands underneath the convent of the Church of Bantay, though he could not say 
when nor how often this had been done.</p>
<p>In connection with the testimony of this witness it is worthy of observation 
that in the "informacion posesoria" executed in 1895 at the instance of the 
parish priest of Bantay, there is no intimation that the alleged donation of the 
lands in question was made or evidenced in a written instrument. On the 
contrary, in reference to one of the smaller parcels included in the larger 
tract now in question, we find the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Friar Lizardo Villanueva, an Augustinian brother and parish priest of the 
pueblo of Bantay, went to the justice of the peace court of that town and prayed 
that he be allowed to prove that the church under his charge had been in 
possession of the above-described hacienda for more than thirty years; that it 
had acquired it by donation from the residents of the said pueblo, and that the 
property had been acquired without any written instrument." </p></blockquote>
<p>This express admission, taken together with the fact that in the execution of 
the "informacion posesoria" in the year 1895, the applicant, the parish priest 
of Bantay, relied wholly on the oral testimony of a few witnesses in support of 
his allegations as to a gift (donaci6n) from the municipality of the entire 
tract, and made no claim that the alleged gift had been made in writing, and the 
further fact that no Written instruments were offered at the trial of the case 
at bar other than the "informacion posesoria‚Äù justifies the inference that no 
writing evidencing the alleged gift was in fact executed. And however this may 
be, it is certain that the existence of such a writing was neither alleged nor 
proven in the court below.</p>
<p>The evidence submitted on behalf of the defendant municipality consisted in 
part of authentic, undisputed documents, conclusively establishing the fact that 
two of the parcels of land composing the entire tract in question were conveyed 
to the defendant municipality by the Augustinian Fathers in or about the years 
1791 and 1803; and that the third was conveyed to it by one Dona Calixta del 
Castillo about 1851. The fact that this property was thus acquired by the 
defendant municipality is not denied by the plaintiff, who, indeed, claims title 
through the municipality by virtue of an alleged gift (donacion).</p>
<p>Two witnesses, former headmen of the municipality of Bantay, were called by 
jthe defendant municipality, who swore positively that no such gift had ever 
been made as that alleged in the complaint, and that neither the church nor its 
representatives ever had possession or control of the land in question.</p>
<p>It is manifest that plaintiff's allegations of title and of right to 
possession, as set forth in the record in this case, must stand or fall in 
accordance with the effect which should be given to the registered "informacion 
posesoria" (possessory information) prepared in the month of March, 1895, and 
registered on the 18th of April of that year. Indeed, counsel for plaintiff rest 
their contentions in this court wholly and exclusively on the probative value 
which they insist should be accorded that instrument.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Possessory informations" of the nature of the one under consideration herein 
were ex parte proceedings had before a judge of first instance or a justice of 
the peace, wherein one in possession of real estate, claiming the right to 
possession, was permitted after notice to the adjoining landowners to set forth 
the fact that he was in actual possession of such real estate and the nature of 
the title under which he claimed the right of possession, and to call such 
witnesses and to produce such evidence in support of his claim as he thought 
necessary and proper. If the evidence thus submitted appeared to be 
satisfactory, and the applicant's claims were not successfully rebutted by some 
interested person the proceedings were approved by the judge before whom they 
were had, who at the same time ordered that they be registered "without 
prejudice to third persons having a better right in the premises." From a 
consideration of the very nature of such <em>ex parte</em> proceedings it is 
clear that in themselves they could in no event have the effect of prejudicing a 
third person who has a better right to the ownership than the claimant in the 
possessory proceedings. When executed in due form, they furnish, at most, prima 
facie evidence of the fact that at the time of their execution, the claimant was 
in possession, claiming the right to possession as set forth in his application. 
Accordingly we find in article 394 of the Mortgage Law the following:</p>
<p>"The period of possession which appears to have elapsed at the time said 
entries are made shall be computed for the prescription which does not require a 
just title, unless a person prejudiced thereby denies it, in which case said 
period of possession must be proven in accordance with the common law.</p>
<p>"Entries of possession shall prejudice or favor third , persons from the date 
of their record, but only with regard to the effects which the laws attribute to 
mere possession.</p>
<p>"The entry of possession shall not prejudice the person who has a better 
right to the ownership of the realty, although his title has not been recorded, 
unless the prescription has confirmed and secured the claim recorded. Between 
the parties the possession shall be effectual from the date prescribed by the 
common law."</p></blockquote>
<p>It is true that provision is made whereby the possession evidenced by a 
registered possessory information may ripen and be converted into a record of 
ownership after twenty years of uninterrupted possession have elapsed from the 
date of entry (art. 393, Mortgage Law), but the title thus secured is no more 
than a statutory title by prescription, and, as we have seen, until the full 
period of twenty years has elapse, a registered possessory information cannot 
prejudice a third person with a better right in the premises. It is true also 
that under the provisions of the Maura Law, persons holding under a registered 
possessory information secured during the very short period during which it was 
in force, were given a title‚Äîas against the Government‚Äîto public lands claimed 
by them; but the provisions of this law in no wise affected the rights of 
claimants other than the Government itself. It is very clear therefore, that the 
possessory information submitted by plaintiff in the case at bar cannot prevail 
against the authentic and undisputed proof of title to the lands in question in 
the defendant municipality.</p>
<p>Let judgment be entered reversing the judgment entered in the court below and 
dismissing the complaint filed in this case, without costs to either party.</p>
