				G.R. No. 1138, April 20, 1903</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE, VS. DAMIAN DE LA CRUZ ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>COOPER, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The defendants, Damian de la Cruz, Francisco Baltimosada, Alvaro Mendoza, and Francisco Rafael, were charged in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Nueva Ecija with  the crime of robbery en cuadrilla.  Damian de la Cruz and  Alvaro Mendoza were  acquitted,  and Francisco  Rafael  and Francisco Baltimosada were convicted and sentenced to the punishment of  two years of <em>presidio correccional</em> with accessories.   The two last-named defendants appeal from the judgment.</p>
<p>On the preliminary examination these defendants confessed to having committed various robberies in the barrio of Tambo and other adjacent barrios, including one on the road to Aliaga, which seems to be the robbery upon which the complaint is founded.  They also confessed to being members of a band of robbers going about committing robberies and other depredations.</p>
<p>When the trial of the  case came on in the Court of First Instance, they plead not guilty and each  of them denied having any knowledge whatever of the robberies to which they confessed.</p>
<p>They state, as a reason for having made the confessions in the preliminary investigation, that  they were  made through fear of ill treatment on the part of the police who had captured them.</p>
<p>Francisco Rafael stated  that he had been illtreated by the lieutenant in whose charge he was, and that he was threatened  by the lieutenant at the time he testified that he would again be illtreated in the same manner if he did not again confess before the justice of the peace.</p>
<p>Francisco Baltimosada also  denied in his testimony  in the Court of  First  Instance that he had anything to do with the robberies committed  and to which he had confessed, and  further stated that he had been terrorized into making the confessions  before  the justice of the peace by threats made by the lieutenant, who had extorted a confession from him  through ill treatment, and that he believed that by making the confessions he would be released from further prosecution.</p>
<p>The lieutenant by whom the defendants claim to have been ill treated  and  forced to make these admissions denied having used any force whatever upon the defendants or any undue persuasions  or threats, and states that the  confessions were made voluntarily.</p>
<p>The justice of  the peace before whom the preliminary examination was held also testified that there  were no undue influences used upon the  defendants at  the preliminary hearing.</p>
<p>We  are not entirely satisfied as to the admissibility of the confessions made  by  the defendants while under arrest.   A confession in order to be  admissible  must be voluntary.  An involuntary  confession is so uncertain with regard to its truthfulness that it is unsafe as evidence to sustain a conviction.</p>
<p>There is no proof whatever offered by  the Government of the <em>corpus delicti</em> except the confessions of the defendants.   Outside  of these confessions there is no proof of any robberies having been committed at the times  and  places at which  the defendants are charged to have committed them.</p>
<p>It is the general  rule that the <em>corpus delicti</em>  must be proven by evidence  independent of confessions.  It  is true that tliis evidence may be circumstantial, but there  should be some evidence  corroborating the confessions.</p>
<p>There is a vagueness both in the confessions and in the complaint.   The names of the  persons against whom the offense; was committed are not stated in either, nor were they produced as witnesses  at the trial.</p>
<p>The case was easily susceptible, so far as we can  see, of proof,  at least  as to the <em>corpus delicti</em>; perhaps circumstances as  to the identity  of the defendants might have been shown connecting them with the commission  of the offense, but it seems that the prosecution in the case relied exclusively upon the confessions and  apparently  made no effort to adduce1 other testimony.  The case has not been made  out to our satisfaction against  the defendants, and we must reverse the judgment of the court below and acquit the defendants on account of the insufficiency of  the evidence, which is  accordingly done.  Costs are adjudged <em>de oficio</em>.</p>
<p><em> Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, </em>and <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em> Willard, J.,</em> concurs in the result.</p>
<p><i>McDonough, J., did not sit in this case.</i></p>
