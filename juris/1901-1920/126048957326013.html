				G.R. No. 1228, March 10, 1903</h4>
				<H3>JUAN ARANETA, PETITIONER, VS. THE HEIRS OF TRANQUILINO GUSTILO, RESPONDENTS.
  
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>LADD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> This is a  petition  for a writ  of <em>certiorari</em> to review the action of the Court of First Instance of Occidental Negros in requiring a supersedeas bond under section 144 of the Code  of Civil Procedure.  It does not appear from the petition what the amount involved in the litigation is, nor in what sum the  bond was  fixed  by  the  court, but it  is alleged that the bond is excessive.  The court below had jurisdiction  to  require the bond as a condition of  a stay of execution, and  to fix its amount.  Assuming that the bond  was excessive,  yet nothing is alleged in the petition which shows that the court exceeded its jurisdiction in the premises or committed any irregularity in its proceedings in  exercise  thereof.   The  writ must therefore be denied. (Code of Civil Procedure,  sections  514, 217, 220.)   So ordered.</p>
<p> <em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Cooper, Willard,</em> and <em>Mapa, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
