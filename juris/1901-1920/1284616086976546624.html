				<h4>
				G.R. No. 12921, September 29, 1917</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. MATEA CAÃ‘ETE, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On this appeal counsel for appellant has overwhelmed the court with a brief 
of 74 pages, containing a foreword and nicely divided into parts and 
subdivisions, with headings suggestive of the characters of a play. Yet, after 
all is said and done, the case turns entirely on the credibility of the 
witnesses. And the lower court, after fair trial was convinced that the 
defendant had been proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. While we have 
followed carefully the argument of counsel on behalf of his client, we do not 
feel it our duty to interfere with the findings of the trial court, and can 
reach no other conclusion from the testimony both of the prosecution and the 
defense, including the admissions of the defendant and her confessions, than 
that she had this considerable amount of opium in her possession.
<p>The judgment of the lower court should have provided for subsidiary 
imprisonment in case of insolvency. We are also convinced through the argument 
of counsel not that the defendant is not guilty, but that, the evidence pointing 
to this woman as having been merely the tool of others, the penalty should be 
lighter than that imposed. Accordingly, we modify the judgment of the lower 
court by substituting six months imprisonment, a fine of ^300 with subsidiary 
imprisonment in case of insolvency, and the costs of both instances. So 
ordered.</p><em>Arellano, C.J., Araullo</em>, and <em>Street, JJ</em>., concur.
