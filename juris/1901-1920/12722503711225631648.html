				<H3>IN RE R. MCCULLOCH DICK.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The Solicitor-General moves the court to revoke its orders providing for a 
stay of execution of its judgment pending proceedings looking to a review of the 
judgment by the Supreme Court of the United States and not to exceed three 
months; and, further, to remand the petitioner to the custody of the chief of 
police of the city of Manila, so that the order of deportation may be executed 
forthwith.
<p>Since the enactment by Congress of the Amendments to the Judicial Code (1916) 
which require litigants in this court, seeking review of our judgments by the 
Supreme Court ol the United States, to institute proceedings to that end by 
filing an application for a writ of certiorari in the clerk's office of the 
Supreme Court of the United States, we have adopted the practice of temporarily 
staying or suspending the execution of our judgments, when timely application is 
made therefor, in any case wherein it is made to appear that the applicant 
desires to make application for such writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of 
the United States; that he will diligently prosecute the prescribed remedy and 
intends to take the necessary steps to submit his application without 
unnecessary delay; that his application for suspension of execution of our 
judgment is made in good faith and not merely for the purpose of securing delay, 
nor based on frivolous grounds; and that the execution of the judgment would 
subject him to irreparable loss, damage, or injury in the event of its 
subsequent reversal by the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>
<p>In the absence of the statutory rules governing the procedure in such cases, 
our practice has been to direct the clerk of the court, in cases heard on 
appeal, to retain the record of the cause in his hands without certifying our 
judgment to the court below; and in cases heard in the exercise of our original 
jurisdiction, to retain control over the record without certifying our judgment 
to the "inferior tribunal, corporation, board or person" charged with its 
execution or with obedience to its mandate, until a day fixed in the order, or 
until the further order of the court.</p>
<p>Suspensions or stays of execution under this practice have usually been 
limited to a period of from two to three months, which experience has shown to 
be sufficient, under ordinary circumstances, to give the applicant an 
opportunity to file his petition for the writ of certiorari in the office of the 
clerk of the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>
<p>In the instant case timely application was made for suspension of the 
execution of our judgment remanding the petitioner to the custody of the chief 
of police for compliance with the deportation order; and it was shown to the 
satisfaction of the court that the application was made in good faith, and that 
the applicant would suffer irreparable injury by the execution of the 
deportation order, if the Supreme Court of the United States should thereafter 
reverse our judgment'and accept the views of the four members of this court who 
dissented therefrom, and were of opinion that the deportation order was "without 
warrant of law."</p>
<p>No objection having been made to the motion for a stay of execution of our 
judgment remanding the petitioner, an order was entered in accordance with the 
established practice above set out.</p>
<p>At the same time, the petitioner (who, by virtue of the suspending order 
remained in the custody of the court) was released from the technical custody of 
our sheriff, and set at liberty upon his filing an approved bond in the sum of 
P20,000, which, under the exceptional circumstances of the case, was conditioned 
not merely upon his remaining within the jurisdiction of the court and subject 
to its order at all times pending the proceedings looking to the review of our 
judgment, but also upon his keeping the peace and not being guilty of any 
offense against the public order and tranquility, nor inciting others to like 
conduct throughout that period.</p>
<p>The Solicitor-General prays for an order vacating these orders providing for 
a stay or suspension of the execution of our judgment and setting the petitioner 
at liberty on bail, on the ground that we have no jurisdiction to issue such 
orders; and on the further ground that, granting, for the sake of argument, that 
we have jurisdiction in the premises, the facts disclosed by the record do not 
justify us in maintaining these orders in force under existing conditions in the 
Philippine Islands.</p>
<p>The Solicitor-General contends that this court having declared, upon full 
consideration of law and the facts, that the Governor-General is vested with 
power to deport the petitioner, we have no power, under our own rulings, to 
interfere with or to control his action in the premises.</p>
<p>But it is equally true that by entering upon the inquiry as to whether the 
Governor-General was lawfully clothed with power to deport the petitioner, we 
recognized the power and duty of the court to adjudicate the question raised by 
the petitioner as to the power of the Governor-General in the premises; and 
asserted our authority, under the law, to have the body of the petitioner 
brought before us in habeas corpus proceedings, and placed at our disposal 
pending the final disposition of the questions thus submitted for 
adjudication.</p>
<p>In the very nature of things the right of the Chief Executive to exercise his 
lawful powers without the interference of .the court must give way, so far as 
that may be necessary to secure a full, fair, and final adjudication by the 
courts of a question as to the legality and existence of powers which he assumes 
to exercise, when that question is raised in <em>habeas corpus</em> proceedings 
by a petitioner alleging that he has been unlawfully deprived of his 
liberty.</p>
<p>The petitioner in the instant case is now under the custody of this court, 
pending the final adjudication of the question raised by him as to the existence 
and legality of the power asserted by the Governor-General in ordering his 
deportion; and although this court has solemnly declared that the 
Governor-General is lawfully vested with such power, there can be no question as 
to the right of the petitioner to apply to the Supreme Court of the United 
States for a review of our judgment.</p>
<p>We are satisfied that under the law and the settled practice of this court, 
we have jurisdiction to suspend the execution of our judgment, and to withhold 
the order remanding the petitioner for deportation for a period of time 
sufficient to give him a suitable opportunity to apply for a writ of certiorari 
from the Supreme Court of the United States. (U. S. <em>vs</em>. Lim, 36 Phil. 
Rep., 682; Compagnie de Commerce et de Navigation D'Extreme Orient <em>vs</em>. 
Hamburg Amerika Packetfacht Actien Gesellschaft, 36 Phil. Rep., 590; E. 
Viegelmann &amp; Co. <em>vs</em>. Collector of Customs, 37 Phil. Rep., 10; R. G. 
No. 11899, Ynchausti &amp; Co. <em>vs</em>. Board of Public Utility 
Commissioners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>)</p>
<p>As a corollary to our ruling that we have jurisdiction <em>temporarily</em> 
to stay or suspend execution of our judgment remanding the petitioner to the 
custody of the officer who delivered him to the custody of the court in 
compliance with the writ of habeas corpus, it follows that it is our duty and 
that we have the power to adopt such measures as may be appropriate and 
necessary for his safe-keeping while in our custody, and to secure compliance 
with our judgment remanding him to the custody of the chief of police for 
deportation, if and when the order staying or suspending execution of that 
judgment is vacated.</p>
<p>But while we entertain no doubt as to our jurisdiction to provide for a 
temporary stay or suspension of execution of our judgment remanding the 
petitioner, and pending such stay, to provide for his retention in our custody, 
either in the hands of our sheriff or at liberty under bail; we are forcibly 
impressed with the representations of the Solicitor-General as to the 
impropriety of maintaining the order letting him to bail, over the objection of 
the Chief Executive, who is primarily charged with the maintenance of the peace, 
good order, and safety of these Islands.</p>
<p>As the Solicitor-General well says, the logical and necessary conclusion to 
be derived from the record of these proceedings, read together with the opinion 
of the court, is that the petitioner "is an undesirable alien, whose presence in 
the Philippine Islands is a menace to the peace and safety of the community." 
The Governor-General, in the lawful exercise of the authority conferred upon him 
under section 69 of the Administrative Code, has so declared, after prior 
investigation of the course of which the petitioner had full opportunity to be 
heard in his own behalf; and this court has expressly held that we are not at 
liberty in the course of these proceedings to reexamine or to controvert the 
sufficiency of the evidence on which he based his conclusions.</p>
<p>Indeed, it was the knowledge of these findings by the Governor-General as 
disclosed by the record, which caused us to condition the letting of the 
petitioner to bail upon the execution of a bond in a substantial sum, 
conditioned not merely upon his holding himself subject to the orders of the 
court pending the stay of execution of our judgment, but also upon his keeping 
the peace throughout that period.</p>
<p>At that time no objection had been filed by the Solicitor-General to the 
motion of petitioner to suspend our judgment pending proceedings looking to its 
review by the Supreme Court of the United States; and, in the absence of 
objection, we conceived that the convenience of the petitioner might properly be 
consulted by setting him at liberty under a substantial bond conditioned as we 
have just indicated.</p>
<p>But it now becomes our duty to consider whether the order letting the 
petitioner to bail should be maintained in force over objection interposed by 
the Solicitor-General on behalf of the Chief Executive; and notwithstanding his 
representations that as "an undesirable alien whose presence in the Philippine 
Islands is a menace to the peace and safety of the community" the petitioner 
should be deported forthwith, and certainly should not be at large to continue 
his pernicious activities at will, during the more or less prolonged period of 
the suspension of execution of our judgment remanding him to the custody of the 
chief of police.</p>
<p>In this connection, our attention has been called to the fact that the 
petitioner is the proprietor and editor of a weekly newspaper of considerable 
circulation and as such has it within his power, if at large, to place more or 
less serious obstacles in the way of measures contemplated by the executive and 
legislative authorities for the recruiting and organization of native troops 
destined to the service of the United States in the present war. Indeed, the 
Solicitor-General asserts that the first issue of that newspaper following the 
promulgation of the decision of this court, contains matter well calculated to 
create and foment racial prejudices and differences, highly detrimental to the 
general welfare and good order of ttie Islands, and especially to be deprecated 
at this time when the utmost peace and harmony should prevail in the face of a 
common enemy.</p>
<p>But without stopping to consider whether there is anything in this issue of 
the Free Press which supports the contentions of the Solicitor-General, we 
cannot escape the conviction that there is a manifest inconsistency between the 
rulings upon which our judgment was based, and the maintenance in force of our 
order setting the petitioner at large on bail, over the objection of the 
Solicitor-General representing the Chief Executive.</p>
<p>Having held that the Governor-General was lawfully authorized to institute 
and maintain deportation proceedings against the petitioner under the provisions 
of section 69 of the Administrative Code; and having declared that we have no 
jurisdiction in these habeas corpus proceedings to re-examine or controvert the 
sufficiency of the evidence on which he based his rulings in the course of these 
proceedings ; and the Governor-General having declared, as a result of an 
investigation lawfully held under his direction, that the petitioner is "an 
undesirable alien, whose presence in the Philippine Islands is a menace to the 
peace and safety of the community;" it would seem to be a flagrant abuse of our 
discretion to turn him loose upon the community, at such a time as this, in the 
face of the insistent objection of the Chief Executive who is primarily charged 
with the maintenance of the safety, peace, and good order of these Islands.</p>
<p>The most that the petitioner is entitled to demand, as of right, is that 
under the transcendent authority of its writ of habeas corpus, this court should 
stay the course of the deportation proceedings, and, if necessary, take him into 
the custody of the court itself, long enough to secure a full and final 
adjudication of the legality of the deportation order. He cannot demand that he 
be released from custody until that question is determined in his favor; though, 
as we have said, the court may, in its discretion, let him to bail pending the 
proceedings.</p>
<p>But this discretion is a sound judicial discretion to be exercised in the 
light of all the surrounding facts and circumstances. After having held that a 
petitioner in habeas corpus proceedings had been lawfully adjudged a dangerous 
lunatic or a desperate criminal no court would be justified, except under the 
most extraordinary circumstances, in letting him to bail merely for the purpose 
of securing a review of the proceedings by a superior court. So this court, 
after upholding the legality of the order deporting the petitioner, and of the 
proceedings wherein he was adjudged "an undesirable alien whose presence in the 
Philippine Islands is a menace to the peace and safety of the community" cannot 
consistently turn him loose upon the community under bail, for the more or less 
prolonged period necessary to secure a review of the proceedings by the Supreme 
Court of the United States, when objection to that course is interposed by the 
executive officer more especially charged with the maintenance of the peace and 
safety of the community.</p>
<p>What has been said in some of the federal courts of the United States as to 
the propriety of exercising the discretionary power to grant bail in favor of 
Chinese persons, pending deportation proceedings against them, in ordinary cases 
wherein it was not asserted that the presence of such persons was a menace to 
the peace, safety, good order or health of the community, has, of course, no 
real bearing in cases wherein the ground upon which the deportation order is 
based is that the deportee is a menace to the peace, good order and safety of 
the community, or a dangerous anarchist, or a person afflicted with a loathsome 
and communicable disease, or the like.</p>
<p>We have concluded, therefore, that while we should and must deny the motion 
of the Solicitor-General to vacate our order staying the execution of our 
judgment, and to turn the petitioner over to the chief of police for deportation 
forthwith, we would not be justified in maintaining in force the order letting 
the petitioner to bail, over the well-founded objection of the Chief Executive, 
who is primarily charged with the conservation of the peace, safety, and good 
order of the Islands. Accordingly, we will entertain a new or an amended motion 
by the Solicitor-General to take the petitioner into the immediate custody of 
the court, to cancel the bond upon which he is now at large, and thereafter 
(since our sheriff is not provided with appropriate facilities to hold the 
petitioner in detention for a more or less prolonged period), to turn him over 
to the custody of the chief of police of the city of Manila or such other 
officer as may be designated by the Chief Executive, for detention pending the 
stay of execution of our judgment in these habeas corpus proceedings.</p>
<p>The motion of the Solicitor-General, in the form in which it has been 
submitted, should be and is hereby denied.</p>

<p align="center"><em><strong>CONCURRING OPINION</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>MALCOLM, J.</strong>, <em>concurring :</em></p>
<p>We never believe in running with the hares and coursing with the hounds. 
Either the chief of police of the city of Manila as the official representative 
of the Chief Executive has custody of the petitioner, or the courts have 
custody. If the chief of police has custody, the motion of the Attorney-General 
to vacate the order issued by this court should be granted and the petitioner 
should be turned over to the representative of the Governor-General for such 
action as the judgment of the latter shall dictate. The decision of the majority 
of this court, if followed to its logical conclusion, might permit of no other 
action. If the courts retain custody of the petitioner, the motion of the 
Attorney-General should be denied. The Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands 
having taken jurisdiction, such jurisdiction should subsist until the 
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the United States attaches. But as between 
these two possibilities there can be no compromise.</p>
<p>Let us notice briefly what has happened. Disregarding the dissenting opinions 
and stating the proposition in most general terms, the court has decided that 
the Governor-General possesses the power to deport aliens and that with this 
official act the courts will not presume to interfere. That judgment, as is our 
right, the court has suspended, and has admitted petitioner to bail because of 
his announced desire to appeal to the United States Supreme Court. The case may 
now be considered as on the way to the higher tribunal. All this means that the 
judgment has not gone out to the Chief Executive but has been stayed in order to 
permit of appeal to the United States Supreme Court and in order to protect the 
rights of the petitioner, pending decision by that court.</p>
<p>The important question (although apparently the other members of the court do 
not consider it so) is whether pending an appeal to the Supreme Court of the 
United States from a final decision of the Supreme Court of the Philippine 
Islands declining to grant the writ of habeas corpus, the latter court has the 
right to admit petitioner to bail.</p>
<p>It is a policy inherent in democracy to admit to bail any person arrested in 
any kind of proceeding except for contempt and for capital offenses. The 
practice of this court in criminal cases has heretofore been to admit to bail 
pending an appeal. This is merely applied justice for it may well be that our 
decision is wrong. The reversal of the decision of the Supreme Court of the 
Philippine Islands in the Weems case<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 
is an instance of the unexpected taking place. Surely it would come with an 
illgrace from this court to treat dissatisfied litigants harshly, or to appear 
to discourage appeals, or to force a party to surrender the constitutional right 
which the Organic Law has given him. Accordingly a person who ultimately may be 
declared innocent should not be made to suffer unnecessarily. We should not 
stand idly by and see a sentence served before the case can be submitted and 
decided by the appellate court.</p>
<p>Now, of course, habeas corpus proceedings are civil and not criminal in 
nature. Nevertheless, deportation is by way of punishment. The effect of 
imprisonment and deportation is not dissimilar. Just as it is not fair to force 
an accused person to serve his sentence before a decision can be reached in the 
United States Supreme Court, so would it be not fair to permit a petitioner in 
habeas corpus to be deported before he can submit his case. To paraphrase 
language of the United States Supreme Court which has heretofore met with the 
approval of this court, it is a serious thing to detain a foreigner who, as in 
this case, has been in this country a number of years, and to order his 
deportation without giving him a full opportunity to assert his rights and 
exhaust his remedies before competent courts. (Liu Hop Fong <em>vs</em>. United 
States [1908], 209 U. S., 453, followed in a decision handed down by Justice 
Willard and concurred in by the Chief Justice and Justices Torres, Mapa, 
Johnson, Carson and Tracey, U. S. <em>vs</em>. Go-Siaco [1909], 12 Phil., 490.) 
The hands of authority should be stayed, if it is legally possible, until it is 
finally determined whether the power to deport exists.</p>
<p>From the authorities can be sifted out the deduction that pending appeal 
release under bail is a matter inherently within the discretion of the court. 
The <em>status quo</em> is ordinarily to be preserved. This means that 
petitioner remains in the custody of the courts, either under bail or, when 
necessary to safeguard the public welfare, in detention in the hands of its 
officer to await the outcome of his appeal. (There can be noted as corroborative 
authority the following: U. S. <em>vs</em>. Go-Siaco [1909], 12 Phil., 490; U. 
S. <em>vs</em>. Lao Chueco [1917], 37 Phil. Rep., 53; <em>In re</em> McKane 
[1894], 61 Fed., 205; <em>Ex parte</em> Green [1908], 165 Fed., 557; U. S. 
Revised Statutes in connection with Jugiro <em>vs</em>. Brush [1891], 140 U. S., 
291; Lau Ow Bew <em>vs</em>. U. S. [1891], 141 U. S. 583; Fong Yue Ting 
<em>vs</em>. U. S. [1893], 149 U. S., 698; Li Sing <em>vs</em>. U. S. [1901], 
180 U. S., 486; Wright <em>vs</em>. Henkel [1903], 190 U. S., 40; Liu Hop Fong 
<em>vs</em>. U. S. [1908], 209 U. S., 453; Rule 34, United States Supreme Court; 
Bouve, Exclusion and Expulsion of Aliens in the United States, pages 664-667.) 
The majority decision admits the force of all this but then diverges to a 
contradictory conclusion.</p>
<p>The original action of this court, in the exercise of its discretion, in 
staying the proceedings in order that the petitioner can have a reasonable time 
to secure from the United States Supreme Court the allowance of an appeal for 
the purpose of determining whether his attempted deportation is authorized, and 
in admitting the petitioner to bail, is believed to be in accord with federal 
practice. More important still, such action conforms to reason and justice. No 
change has taken place since the petitioner was released on bail which would 
warrant the modification of the order contemplated by the decision of the 
majority upon the pending matter. The motion should be denied, without 
qualification.</p>
