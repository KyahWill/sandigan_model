				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On the 14th of June, 1904, the  Order of  Dominicans presented a petition to the Court  of Land Registration asking that it be inscribed as the owner of a certain tract of land known as the "Hacienda de  San Juan del Monte,' containing 168 hectares.   The Solicitor-General appeared and opposed the petition on the ground that the property belonged to the Government. A judgment was entered in the Court of Land Registration on the 7th of December, 1904, granting the prayer of the petition as to all the land except that part included in what was known as the military zone.  On  the 31st day of October,  1905, another judgment was entered in that  court granting the prayer of the petition with  respect to the military zone.  The Government  excepted to both judgments,  moved for a  new trial on the ground that the  evidence did not justify the decisions, excepted to the orders denying these motions, and has brought the case here by two bills of exceptions.</p>
<p>According to the petition the land  is bounded as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Linda por el Norte. y Oeste con  el rio Salapan, por el Sur con el rio de  San Juan, y por el Este con terrenos de los Padres Agustinos, D. Trinidad Jurado y la ciudad de Manila."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only evidence which was presented to show that the petitioner was the owner of the 168 hectares thus described is the following:</p>
<p>On the 6th day of September, 1602, Capt, Julian de Cuenca made a donation "de un pedazo de tierra en  una loma en el estero de Meytumas y en tierra de una estancia suya en el estero de Sapa."  On the 6th of February, 1641, Captain Santiago de Gastelu made a donation to the petitioner of "20 brazas de tierra de ancho  y 40 de largo de  las tierras  de dicha su estancia en la parte y lugar que las quisiera escoger el dicho  padre prior."  On  the 5th of May, 1041, judicial possession was given to the petitioner of the lands above described.  On the 4th of  September, l970, under a judgment against Juan Guerrero, there was sold to  Captain Diego de Palencia a tract of  land which was described as follows: "La estancia de ganado mayor nombrada Santa Oatalina y tierras de labor que  el dicho alfÂ£rez Juan Guerrero tiene y posee en terminos del dicho convento de San Juan del Monte."  On the 27th of November, 1670, Captain Diego de Palencia conveyed the land thus acquired by him  to the petitioner.</p>
<p>There is no evidence in the  case  relating  to the time elapsing between 1670 and 1891.  On the 7th of  October of the last-named year the <em>gobernadorcillo</em> of the pueblo of San Juan del Monte and six of the  principal  men of  the town signed  a document in which they stated that they had surveyed and measured the "Hacienda de San Juan del Monte" and that its boundaries were as described in  the document which they  then  signed.  These boundaries  are substantially the boundaries set out in the petition in this case.  On the 12th of January, 1892, the  surveyor who, according to the document last above mentioned, took part in the survey made a map of the <em>hacienda</em> which conforms substantially with the map presented by the petitioner.  On the 21st of January, 1893, the  <em>procurador-general</em> of  the Order of Dominicans signed a notarial document in which he stated that the petitioner was the owner of the "Hacienda de San Juan, del Monte," giving the sources of its title thereto and stating the boundaries thereof substantially as they are  stated in the petition.   This document was annotated in the Registry of Property on the 28th of February, 1893. Evidence was  also  introduced to show that the plaintiff had paid tithes upon the "Hacienda de San Juan del Monte" for many years.</p>
<p>Upon this evidence the Solicitor-General claims that the ownership of the petitioner to the land described in the petition and  the plan  attached  thereto was not  proven. We think that this contention  must be  sustained.   No attempt was made to show that the land described in the documents executed prior to 1671 was the same land  as that described in the petition, except by  the introduction of the document signed by the <em>gobernadorcillo</em> of the pueblo of San Juan del Monte in 1891.  This document was not authorized by any law  then  in force and it can produce no more effect than that produced by a statement  made out of court by private persons who were familiar  with the location of the land.  None of the persons  who signed this document, nor the surveyor, nor anyone else was called as a witness to  corroborate the statement made therein. No parol evidence was offered to prove that the land described by  metes and bounds in the petition is  the tract of land known as the "Hacienda de San Juan del Monte."</p>
<p>The notarial  document  which was recorded in   1893 referred to no title deeds which authorized the  description which was  therein given of the land  in controversy.   The title deeds  therein mentioned did not show that the  land in them described was the land  which is now  claimed  to be the "Hacienda de San Juan del Monte."  Neither the document of 1891 nor the plan of 1892 is mentioned therein, nor is there anything to show that they were ever presented to the registrar.   The ground on which the registrar acted in inscribing the "Hacienda de San Juan  del Monte"  with the boundaries therein given  to it was not the title deeds presented but the statement made by the <em>procurador-general</em> of the order in the document referred to above.   This statement was not sufficient authority for  that description. If the title deeds presented with this document  did not warrant the description  of the land which the  registrar made, the inscription can not in this  case give  to the  petitioner any additional rights.   (Article 20 of the Mortgage Law; Merchant vs.  Lafuente<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> (4 Off. Gaz., 239) ; Ker &amp; Co. m. Cauden<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2] </sup>(4 Off.  Gaz., 732).</p>
<p>The result is that while it appears  from the evidence in the case that the petitioner makes a claim of ownership to a tract of land known as the "Hacienda de San Juan del Monte," there is no evidence  to show that the  "Hacienda de San Juan del Monte" is the land described in the petition  by area and bounds.  The petition alleges that the petitioner is the owner of 168 hectares of land, but "there is nothing in any one of the title deeds offered in evidence to show that the petitioner is the owner of this or any other definite amount of land.   By reason of this defect in the evidence in regard to the identity of the land described in the  title  deeds with that described  in  the petition, the judgments of the court below can in no event be, sustained.</p>
<p>The petitioner claims that it is entitled to an affirmance of the judgments on the ground that the case is brought within  paragraph 6 of section  54 of Act No.  926, the Public  Land Act,  That article is in part as  follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"SEC. 54. The following-described persons or their legal successors in right,  occupying public lands in the Philippine  Islands, or claiming to  own  any such  lands or interest therein, but whose titles to such lands have not been perfected,  may apply to  the Court of Land  Registration of the Philippine Islands for confirmation of  their claims and the issuance of  a certificate of title  therefor.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>"6. All persons who by themselves or their  predecessors in interest have been in the open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation of agricultural public lands, as defined by said act of Congress of July first, nineteen hundred and two, under a <em>bona fide</em> claim of ownership except as against the Government, for a period of ten years next preceding the taking effect  of this act, except when prevented by war or <em>force majeure</em>, shall be  conclusively presumed to have performed  all the conditions essential to a Government grant and to  have received the same, and shall  be entitled to a certificate of title to such land under the provisions of this chapter."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If a possession of the land described in the petition such: as is required by this section had been proved, we should have no hesitation in affirming the judgments.  The  fact that relief was not specifically  sought under this act is not important.  The petitioner asked generally that its ownership of the land be registered.   That petition should  be- granted if the evidence showed that it was entitled to such relief under any law in force in the Islands.</p>
<p>In  this  particular case the fact that  the Director  of Lands had not been cited would not prevent the  granting of such relief.  He is merely the person designated by law as the one on whom the summons must be served in order that the Government may have notice of the claim and an opportunity to assert  its rights.  By Jaw, when he is cited,  the  Attorney-General  is  bound  to represent him. The  Government has appeared  in this case and is now an active party therein.  So  far as the question of procedure is concerned, there would be no difficulty in allowing the petitioner the benefits of  Act No.  926.  But the difficulty  is found in the want  of  evidence to show that possession which is required by section 54.  No proof was presented in the court below to show that from 1670 to the present time the petitioner had been in the actual occupation  of any of the land described in its petition, or that it is  now in such occupation.</p>
<p>The judgments of the court below must be set aside, but in view of all the circumstances we think  that  the case should be remanded for a new trial in order to  give the petitioner an opportunity  to bring itself within the provisions of said Act No. 926.</p>
<p>With a view to such further  proceedings, we  will say that  the questions here raised by the Government in  its second bill of exceptions in regard to the military zone have been  decided adversely to it in the case of Inchausti &amp; Co.vs. The Commanding General,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">(1)</sup> No. 2127, November 1,1906.</p>
<p>The judgments of the court  below contained in the two bills  of exceptions  are  set aside and  the entire  case  remanded to the court below for a new trial only of the issues raised between the  petitioner and the Government. Upon such new trial it will not be necessary to retake the evidence already taken,  but either one of  the two parties will be at liberty to present such additional evidence as it may desire.  No costs will he allowed to either party in this court.  At the expiration of twenty  days let judgment he entered accordingly, and ten days  thereafter the case he returned to the Court of Land Registration for new trial.   So ordered.</p>
