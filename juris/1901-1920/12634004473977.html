				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This  is an  action by the plaintiff to recover from the defendant the sum of P1,442.95, alleged to  be due him from the latter.   The court below  rendered  judgment in favor of the  plaintiff for  the aforesaid sum and  legal interest thereon at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from the  25th of March,  1905,  with costs against the  defendant,  who excepted to  the said judgment, made a motion for  a  new trial on the ground  that the findings of fact  contained in the said judgment were plainly and manifestly against the weight of the evidence, and has  brought  the case  to  this court by a hill of exceptions.</p>
<p>The evidence shows that  for a period of three years, more or less,  the plaintiff had been furnishing to the defendant native  cloth  for the latter's store in the  city of Manila. The goods were at first furnished on credit, hut  the business relations of the parties ceased entirely in  1004.  The defendant had a partner by the name of Yapsuan, who was the manager of the  business.  The defendant  introduced him to the plaintiff as such manager,  and told  him that Yapsuan had authority from him to receive the cloth, and that the value thereof  should  be charged to his, the defendant's account, and in fact the cloth  was, as a rule, received  by Yapsuan from the plaintiff,   it became necessary for  Yapsuan to return to China in  1902 on account of ill health and a liquidation  of the accounts between  the plaintiff  and the defendant was made in  December of (he said year, showing a balance of Pl ,444.05 in favor of the plaintiff, which the defendant expressly undertook to pay. This was proved not only by the testimony of the plaintiff himself,  but  by  that of two  witnesses  who were present. After the liquidation was made the defendant continued to buy goods from the plaintiff for cash until the year 1904, when, as already stated, the business  relations between the parties ceased.</p>
<p>The defendant has failed to  show that  he had  paid  the aforesaid balance of P1,444.05  or any part thereof.  Consequently the judgment of  the court  below  is just and legal  and should be affirmed.   There  is a  difference  of P2 between the.  said balance  and the amount of the judgment but, as the court  properly said,  the plaintiff is not entitled to receive more1 than he prays for in his complaint, and the amount stated in the judgment is all that is sought to be recovered.</p>
<p>It is contended by  the appellant that  the court below erred in not finding that,  the only indebtedness of the defendant being Pl,442.05 according to the liquidation made in December, 1002,  he  having thereafter paid the sum  of Pl,810.S7 as alleged in the complaint, and in default  of proof as  to the value of the goods furnished to the defendant,  after that date, the plaintiff could not maintain an action to recover the said sum.   There is, in fact, no evidence in the record upon this last point.   It was not necessary, however, to offer such evidence.  The action was not for the recovery of the value of the goods  furnished to the defendant after the liquidation  of  1902.  The plaintiff himself testifled that the defendant had paid cash for such goods, but  alleged that the latter had paid nothing  on account of the balance due after the said liquidation.  His testimony upon this point  has not been contradicted  in any way  and  it is apparent from  such testimony that the P1 ,810.87 represented the value of the goods for which the defendant paid cash.  If this amount was mentioned at "all in the complaint, it was for the purpose of comparing the same witli the total value of the goods furnished the defendant up to the year 1904, which, according to  the complaint, amounted to P3,235.75.  It should be borne in  mind that the plaintiff continued  to furnish goods to  the  defendant after the liquidation until the year 1904.   There  is  no evidence that the aforesaid amount was paid on account of the  balance due because of the  liquidation and not  on account  of  the value of the  said goods.  The plaintiff testified  without contradiction, that  absolutely nothing had been paid on the balance due from the said liquidation.</p>
<p>It is further alleged by the appellant that there is nothing to show that after the year 1902 he continued to purchase goods from the plaintiff, paying cash therefor,  as was  erroneously found  by the  court below.   The positive and  uncontradicted statement  of the  plaintiff to the contrary is sufficient, however,  to justify the finding  of the court below upon that point.   That court, therefore, committed no error in this respect.</p>
<p>The  appellant  finally contends  that  the  goods having been furnished to and received  by the partnership between himself and Yapsuan, and the accounts of  the  same not having  been liquidated, this  action  should have been brought against the partnership itself, or against the partners jointly, and not against the defendant only.  However that  ina.v  be, the fact remains  that the defendant in this case  was the only one who contracted with the plaintiff  in his own  name, as appears  from  the  latter's testimony. When the defendant  told the plaintiff that he had authorized Yapsuan to receive  the goods,  he instructed  the plaintiff to  charge them  to  him  (the  defendant)  personally. The defendant,  moreover,  undertook  personally  to pay the balance due the plaintiff, after the liquidation made in December, 1902, such being the sum sought to be recovered in this case, as appears from the testimony of the plaintiff and that of the two witnesses who  took part in  the said liquidation.   Consequently the court  below  properly allowed the plaintiff to maintain this action against the defendant.  The  judgment appealed  from is  accordingly affirmed with the costs of this instance against the appellant.  After the expiration of twenty days let judgment be entered  in accordance herewith and in due  time let  the record be remanded to the court below for execution.  So ordered.</p>
