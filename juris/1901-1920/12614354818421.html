				G.R. No. 2735, March 20, 1906</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE, VS. FRANCISCO REYES, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>MAPA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The defendant in this case is charged with the crime of frustrated homicide.  The court below found that the crime had been committed, convicted the defendant as the author thereof, and sentenced him to six years and one day imprisonment at hard labor, with costs.</p>
<p>The Attorney-General, in his brief  filed in  this court, contends that the facts established by the record do not show the commission of the crime  of frustrated homicide but of <em>lesiones menos graves</em>, as provided for and penalized in article 418 of, the Penal Code.</p>
<p>We agree with the contention of the Attorney-General.</p>
<p>We have already held in the case of the United States <em>vs</em>. Saturnino Trinidad,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> No. 1851, that the principal and most essential element  of  attempted  homicide  (and the same thing may be said of the crime of frustrated  homicide) is the intent on the part of the assailant to take the  life of the person attacked,  and such intent  must be proved in so clear and evident a manner as to  exclude  any doubt as to the real intention  of  the aggressor.  And, as the Attorney-General properly says in his  brief, there is nothing in the record  which would  show clearly and beyond doubt an intention on the part of the defendant to kill.</p>
<p>Therefore, it would not be proper to classify this crime as that of frustrated homicide.  The acts committed by the accused constitute the crime of <em>lesiones</em> only,  and the said <em>lesiones</em> having taken more than eight  days and less than thirty to cure,  they should be classified as <em>menos graves</em> and the accused should be punished with <em>arresto mayor</em> or with banishment and a fine of from 325 to 3,250 pesetas, at the discretion of the court, in accordance with article 4X8 of the Penal Code.   The evidence clearly shows that the defendant is guilty of the said assault.</p>
<p>Wherefore, we hereby reverse the judgment of the court below  and sentence  the defendant to  three months  of <em>arresto mayor,</em> from  which shall be deducted one-half of the time he has served as a detention prisoner;  to indemnify the offended party in the sum of 20 pesos, or in default thereof to suffer the corresponding subsidiary  imprisonment at the rate of one day for every 2.50 pesos which he has to pay, and t the costs of this instance.   After the  expiration of ten days from the date of final judgment, let  the case be remanded to  the Court of First Instance for  execution of the said judgment.   So ordered.</p>
<em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson, Carson,</em> and <em>Willard, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
