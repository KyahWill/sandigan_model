				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On the 7th day of November, 1916, the prosecuting attorney of the Province of 
Iloilo presented a complaint in the Court of First Instance of said province, 
charging the defendant with a violation of section 2662 of the Administrative 
Code. The complaint alleged:
<blockquote>
<p>"That, during,the month of October of the present year, 1916, within the 
district of this municipality of Iloilo, Province of Iloilo, Philippine Islands, 
the said accused was cashier of the Iloilo customhouse, duly qualified and 
appointed as such; that while, by virtue of his office, collecting, receiving 
and depositing funds as customs duties belonging to the Philippine Government, 
he did willfully, unlawfully and criminally take and misappropriate and fail 
duly to account for and enter in the customhouse books P12,000 collected by him 
on October 19, 1916, which sum he appropriated to his own use and for his 
personal gain to the prejudice of the Philippine Government until October 24, 
1916, and did not pay and turn into the treasury said misappropriated sum until 
after he had been required so to do; acts committed with violation of 
law."</p></blockquote>
<p>Upon said complaint the defendant was duly arrested and arraigned upon the 
22d day of November, 1916. Upon arraignment the defendant pleaded guilty to the 
crime charged in the complaint. In view of the voluntary confession of guilt 
made in open court by the defendant the lower court found him guilty of the 
crime charged and sentenced him to be imprisoned for a period of fifteen months 
and to pay the costs of the prosecution. He was further sentenced to be 
disqualified forever from holding any public office or employment of any nature 
whatever within the Philippine Islands. He was further deprived of all accrued 
leave.</p>
<p>From the sentence of the lower court the defendant appealed to the Supreme 
Court.</p>
<p>The appellant alleges that the lower court committed the following errors: 
(1) no preliminary investigation having been previously held, the court <em>a 
quo</em> never acquired any jurisdiction over the case and the accused; (2) the 
accused not having been ever informed of his right to appear with the aid of 
counsel, he was deprived of his constitutional right to have counsel and 
consequently the proceedings held were null and void.</p>
<p>With reference to said errors it may be said :</p>
<p>First. That while defendants in criminal actions are entitled of right 
(<em>a</em>) to a preliminary examination and (<em>b</em>) to be represented by 
an attorney, they are renounceable rights. The right to a preliminary 
investigation is a personal right conferred by statute and may be waived. 
(People <em>vs.</em> Tarbox, 115 Cal., 57; Korth <em>vs</em>. State, 46 Neb., 
631; Ryan <em>vs</em>. The State, 83 Wis., 486; People <em>vs</em>. Harris, 103 
Mich., 473; Benjamin <em>vs</em>. State, 25 Fla., 675; U. S. <em>vs</em>. 
Cockrill, 8 Phil. Rep., 742; U. S. <em>vs</em>. Asebuque, 9 Phil. Rep., 241; U. 
S. <em>vs</em>. Aquino, 11 Phil. Rep., 244; U. S. <em>vs.</em> Lete, 17 Phil. 
Rep., 79.)</p>
<p>If no objection is raised in the court below on the ground that there has 
been no preliminary investigation the accused will be deemed to have waived his 
right thereto and such objection cannot be raised for the first time upon 
appeal. (U. S. <em>vs</em>. Lete, 17 Phil. Rep., 79; State <em>vs.</em> Myers, 
54 Kan., 206; Coffield <em>vs</em>. State, 44 Neb., 417.)</p>
<p>It is true that under the provisions of General Orders No. 58 persons accused 
of crime are entitled to attorneys for their defense if they have the means, or 
if they are without such means to have attorneys <em>de officio</em> appointed 
by the court, but that right is a personal one and may be waived also. It is 
waived when the defendant voluntarily submits himself to the jurisdiction of the 
court and proceeds with the defense. Under such circumstances the prosecution 
may go to trial without violating that particular right of the accused. (U. S. 
<em>vs</em>. Go-Leng, 21 Phil. Rep., 426; U. S. <em>vs</em>. Labial and Abuso, 
27 Phil. Rep., 82; U. S. <em>vs</em>. Custan, 28 Phil. Rep., 19; U. S. 
<em>vs</em>. Kilayko, 31 Phil. Rep., 371.)</p>
<p>Second. That when the appellant fails to raise the question of his right to 
have an attorney and to have a preliminary examination in the trial court that 
question will not be considered when raised for the first time in the Supreme 
Court. The failure of the record to disclose affirmatively that the trial judge 
advised the accused of his right to have counsel and to have a preliminary 
investigation is not sufficient ground to reverse the judgment of conviction and 
to send the case back for a new trial. (U. S. <em>vs</em>. Labial and Abuso, 27 
Phil. Rep., 82; U. S. <em>vs</em>. Custan, 28 Phil. Rep., 19.) There is nothing 
in the record in the present case to show that the defendant raised these 
questions in the court below. The doctrine<em> omnia przesumuntur rite te 
solemniter esse acta donec probetur in contrarium</em> is specially applicable 
against the contention of the appellant. And, moreover, paragraph 31 of section 
334 of Act No. 190 provides that the courts will presume that "the law has been 
obeyed," until the contrary is shown.</p>
<p>We find nothing in the record which would justify a modification of the 
foregoing rules of law. The defendant was the cashier of the department of 
customs in the city of Iloilo. That fact would indicate that he was a man of at 
least ordinary intelligence.</p>
<p>It will be remembered that the lower court, in its sentence, deprived the 
defendant of his accumulated leave. We assume that the defendant was in the 
civil service and was entitled to certain leave privileges. The law under which 
the defendant was accused provides for no such punishment. That part of the 
sentence, therefore, is null and void.</p>
<p>For the foregoing reasons, we are of the opinion, and so hold, that the 
sentence of the lower court should be modified and that the defendant should be 
sentenced to be imprisoned in accordance with the provisions of section 2662 of 
the Administrative Code, for a period of fifteen months, and be disqualified 
forever from holding any public office or employment of any nature whatever 
within the Philippine Islands, and to pay the costs. So 
ordered.</p><em>Arellano, C. J., Carson, Araullo,</em> and <em>Street, JJ.</em>,

<p>MALCOLM, J., dissenting:</p>
<p>Two of the basic privileges of the accused in a criminal prosecution are the 
right to the assistance of counsel and the right to a preliminary examination. 
President McKinley made the first a part of the Organic Law in his Instructions 
of the Commission by imposing the inviolable rule that in all criminal 
prosecutions the accused "shall enjoy the right * * * to have the assistance of 
counsel for his defense." Judge Cooley says that this is "perhaps the privilege 
most important to the person accused of crime." (Cooley, Constitutional 
Limitations, 7th ed., 74.) The Code of Criminal Procedure contains mandatory 
provisions reinforcing both rights. True, it is, that the accused may waive 
these personal prerogatives. True also is it, that the appellant court can 
properly indulge in all reasonable presumptions in favor of the regularity of 
the proceedings of the trial court. But this does not mean that without the 
slightest indication in the record, the Supreme Court can vitiate these vital 
rights of the accused by erecting an edifice of presumptions upon the sands of 
an empty record. In the case at bar, there is not a word in the record to 
indicate that the accused was informed by the court of his right to counsel, and 
that he waived this right; and, that he waived his right to a preliminary 
examination. To read these things into the record is to do a grave injustice to 
the accused.</p>
<p>The early decision of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands in U. S. 
<em>vs</em>. Gimeno ([1902] 1 Phil., 236) seems to state the true rule. Since 
then, unfortunately, the court, following the dissenting opinion in the Gimeno 
case, has finally been led to enunciate the doctrine in U. S. <em>vs</em>. 
Labial and Abuso ([1914] 27 Phil. 82) that the failure of the record to disclose 
affirmatively that the trial judge advised the accused of his right to have 
counsel is not sufficient ground to reverse the judgment of conviction and to 
send the case back for a new trial. To such a doctrine, repugnant as it is to 
the fundamentals of Philippine organic and statutory law, I cannot give my 
assent.</p>
<p>I would suggest that, in this or similar cases in which counsel on appeal 
advance these errors, they make use of the best evidence obtainable to 
substantiate their claims.</p></div>
