				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE, VS. CASIMIRO GASAL, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On July 1, 1903, the deputy provincial fiscal of the Island of Cebu filed an 
information in the Court of First Instance of that province, amending a former 
information, accusing Casimiro Gasal of the crime of homicide, in that on the 
16th of May, 1903, between 9 and 10 o'clock at night, in the place called Nangca 
of the town of Consolacion, without justification therefor, he threw stones at 
Andres Tiro, striking him in the forehead and felling him to the ground, after 
which Gasal threw another stone which struck Andres in the region of the left 
ear, causing his death then and there in consequence of the injuries so 
inflicted, contrary to the statute in such case made and provided.
<p>The court, finding that the crime had been committed and that the defendant 
was guilty thereof, with certain mitigating and aggravating circumstances 
enumerated in the decision, sentenced the defendant to the penalty of twelve 
years and one day of <em>reclusion temporal</em> at hard labor, with the 
accessories mentioned in article 61 of the Penal Code, to pay an indemnity of 
1,000 Mexican pesos to the heirs of the deceased, and to pay the costs, and in 
case of insolvency to subsidiary imprisonment in accordance with the provisions 
of article 50 of the said code.</p>
<p>The evidence in this case shows that one day in the month of May, 1903, on or 
about the 16th of the month, about 9 p. m., while several men were gambling in a 
field in the place called Nangca, in the municipality of Consolacion, Island of 
Cebu, two of their number, Pio Limabug and Bernardo Vacunador, got into a 
quarrel; that upon this the game stopped, there was a disturbance, and some of 
the players left the gambling place; that upon this Andres Tiro demanded of 
Casimiro Gasal the payment of four pennies which he had won from the latter in 
the game, and Gasal, becoming enraged, blew out the candle, picked up a stone, 
and threw it at Andres, striking him on the forehead and felling him to the 
ground; that Andres sat up and was in the act of rising when Gasal threw another 
stone at him at close range, striking Andres above the ear;that Andres fell to 
the ground unconscious, whereupon the assailant walked away; that Eleno Herrera 
and Felix Tiro, who witnessed the assault, then picked up the wounded man and 
took him to his house, where he died three days later without having regained 
consciousness.</p>
<p>Besides the two witnesses above cited, the occurrence was also witnessed by 
Pio Limabug and Bernardo Vacunador, who testified to the facts above related, 
stating that the assault was committed in an open field; that the moon was 
shining at the time; that before the assault Casimiro Gasal blew out the sperm 
candle which he held. Limabug testified that when Andres was hit by the first 
stone he turned around and fell to the ground. The witness Vacunador did not see 
that Limabug, with whom he was quarreling, carried a dagger. Three witnesses 
testified that while they were all confined in the municipal building, during 
the preliminary investigation, the defendant, Gasal, entreated them not to say 
that he had been the one who threw the stones at; the deceased; that the witness 
Herrera, a relative of the defendant, replied that he would have to testify 
against him because he would have to tell the truth.</p>
<p>It is plainly proven that Andres Tiro suffered a violent death as a 
consequence of two stones thrown at him on the night in question in a place 
where a number of people had been gambling. This fact constitutes the crime of 
homicide, comprised in article 404 of the Penal Code, none of the qualifying 
circumstances enumerated in article 403, which defines the crime of murder, 
having been present in the commission of the offense.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the fact that the defendant pleaded not guilty to the crime 
charged, with all the proof is sufficient to show his guilt as the sole author 
by direct participation and to convict him of the crime of assaulting the 
deceased by stoning him, as a result of which he was so seriously injured that 
he was unconscious from that time until his death, which took place on the third 
day. It follows, therefore, that the defendant is guilty of the crime of 
homicide.</p>
<p>The denials and exculpatory allegations of the accused, as well as the 
testimony of the witnesses for the defense, are insufficient to overcome the 
result of the evidence of the prosecution against him. It has not been shown 
that anyone else was the slayer of the deceased, or that Gasal left the scene of 
the occurrence before the assault was committed. It may be true that the 
defendant was found in his house that night, and that Dionisio Maglasan saw him 
running behind him, but it must have been after he wounded the deceased at the 
scene of the occurrence. If in addition to this we take into consideration the 
contradictory statements of the accused as well as those in the testimony of the 
witnesses Marcelina Tolo and Matea Gasal, and that inspite of their testimony 
and that of the witness Maglasan, the four witnesses for the prosecution denied 
that a shower of stones had fallen on the players, the guilt of the defendant as 
author of this crime of homicide cannot be doubted.</p>
<p>In the commission of this crime the only mitigating circumstance to be 
considered is that established in paragraph 6, article. 9 of the code, it having 
been proven by the testimony of the witnesses that the defendant Gasal was drunk 
that night, for which reason he must have attacked the deceased while in an 
intoxicated condition, and in the absence of proof to the contrary it must be 
presumed that that vice was not habitual with him.</p>
<p>The aggravating circumstances of paragraphs 6 and 20 of article 10 of the 
code, and the mitigating circumstances of paragraphs 3 and 8 of article 9 of the 
same, applied in the sentence appealed from must be rejected, inasmuch as the 
insistent and repeated assault made upon so light a provocation shows that it 
was the defendant's fixed purpose to kill the deceased. The confusion and 
tumult, if anyâ€”and as to this there is no proof-do not constitute a 
circumstance analogous to the others of the same section. The fact that a second 
stone was thrown at the "deceased just as he attempted to get up does not show 
that an attempt was made to augment unnecessarily the injuries, already 
inflicted upon the deceased, but rather determination of the assailant to kill 
his adversary. The ages of both the accused and the deceased being approximately 
the same, it does not appear that the accused, Gasal, failed to regard the 
respect due Tiro on account of his age, or that the accused abused the advantage 
of youth and strength over the debility of an old man. Consequently, there being 
only one mitigating circumstance and no aggravating circumstances, the penalty 
imposed by the court below is in conformity with the law.</p>
<p>For the reasons stated, with the elimination of the condemnation to hard 
labor and the subsidiary penalties imposed by the decision of the court below, 
and the addition of the accessories enumerated in article 59 of the code, we are 
of the opinion that the decision of the trial judge, by which Casimiro Gasal is 
condemned to twelve years and one day of <em>reclusion temporal</em> must be 
affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant Judgment will be 
entered accordingly and the case remanded for its execution, with a certified 
copy of this opinion.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Cooper, Willard, Mapa, McDonough, </em>and <em>Johnson, 
JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
