				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This action involves the ownership of a small  coconut plantation in the Province of Tayabas and the fruits thereof since 1905.  The trial court found that the plaintiff and her minor brothers and sisters  (whom she represents) are the owners <i>pro indiviso</i> of this plantation, and entitled to the possession of the same, together  with a reasonable amount, which was fixed at P100, for its use and occupation.</p>
<p>There is no question about the  location and description of the land in dispute.  Both parties claim to have derived their title from the same person, Agata Botocave.   The plaintiffs claim that this land was  purchased from the said Agata Botocave on January 15,  1895, by  their deceased father.  The  defendant, Marciana Dirilo, claims that she bought this property from the same person in the year 1894. The plaintiffs presented a  private document  evidencing the purchase made by their father.  The defendant Marciana presented no document of  her alleged purchase, but claims that her contract was  a verbal one only.   The private  document is attacked  by  the  defendants as false in that the signature of Felis Dirilo, one of the subscribing witnesses, is not genuine.  In support of this  proposition, one Stevers was called as a handwriting expert and  testified that he had been district auditor in the Government service since April 1,  1908; that during that time it had been necessary for him  at various times to identify signatures on  money orders and registered mails; that he  had not made  any special study of the science of chirography;  and that he is not skilled in this art.   He testified to certain peculiarities in the signatures to the document presented by the plaintiffs as compared with the body of the document, and especially with regard to the signature of Felis Dirilo, and stated tjiat in his opinion the signature of Felis Dirilo was signed by the same person who wrote the body of the  document.  It is admitted that the document is not in the handwriting of Felis  Dirilo, but it does not follow that the signature of the said Felis  Dirilo is a forgery.  Apparently, Mr. Stevers did not note that the first  name of Dirilo  is spelled in the body of the document F-e-l-i-x, while in the signature it is spelled F-e-l-i-s.  It is hardly  probable that if the  same person wrote the document and signed  this name thereto he would have made this mistake in the spelling of "Felis." And furthermore, the  sons of the  vendor, who signed the document at the time  it was executed,  testified positively that the said document was executed in due form and 'that all  the signatures thereto  are  genuine.</p>
<p>Mr. Stevers did not qualify as a handwriting expert.  He admitted that he had made no special study as such and that he was not skilled in this  art.  In order to render one a competent  witness as an expert to the genuineness of a signature, he must have been educated in the business about which he testifies or he must have acquired actual skill and knowledge  of the subject.   It  is not enough that  he has sometimes compared signatures of other persons when disagreements as to their genuineness had arisen in the course of business.  (Goldstein <em>vs.</em> Black et al., 50 Cal., 462; Heacock <em>vs.</em> State, 13 Tex. Court of App., 97; State <em>vs.</em> Tompkins, 71 Mo., 618.)</p>
<p>Jose Dirilo, father of the  plaintiffs, purchased the  land in question in 1895 and immediately entered into the possession. He  remained in possession  until the year 1902, when  he mortgaged this land to one Pablo Roses and left Pagbilao, where the land is located,  and never returned.  About 1909, sometimes after the death of Jose"  Dirilo, his children, the plaintiffs, returned to Pagbilao and found the defendants in possession of the land.  They immediately demanded the return of this land, but the defendants  refused to comply with this demand.  Pablo Roses had had possession of the land about a year when he mortgaged it  to one Jose  Dirilo, a cousin of the deceased father of the plaintiffs.   This Jose Dirilo remained in possession until about 1905,  when the defendant Marciana Dirilo,  who is a sister of the deceased father of the plaintiffs, claimed that this land belonged to the undivided estate of their (Marciana  and Jose Dirilo's) parents, and upon this claim secured possession of the same; but on the trial of this case in the court below she claimed to have purchased this property, as we have said, from Agata Botocave.   The defendants well knew that this  land belonged to  the heirs  of the deceased Jose Dirilo and  that they had no  interest whatever in said land.  They also knew that the products from this  small hacienda had long  before 1909 fully paid the amount for which  it was originally mortgaged.   So it cannot be said that they have been possessors in good faith since demand was made upon them for the return of the land.   They must, therefore, account for the products since that year.  The amount fixed by the court at P100 is fully supported by the evidence.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from is therefore affirmed in all of its parts,  with costs against the appellants.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson,</em> and <em>Moreland, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
