				G.R. No. 3992, December 21, 1907</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. MAGDALENO MENDEZ (ALIAS BISOY), DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The information filed in this case is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The  undersigned fiscal accuses Magdaleno Mendez, (alias Bisoy), detained at the provincial jail, of the crime of robbery (art. 508 of the Penal Code), committed  as follows:</p>
  <p>"That on or about the 21st day of December, 190(5, the accused Magdaleno Mendez (alias  Bisoy)  went up to the house in which one Vy-Chiong dwelt, in the municipality of Dumaguete, Oriental Negros, P. I.,  and maliciously, criminally, and with intent of gain stole a trunk which was locked and took the same to a field in which some banana trees were planted, about 20 <em>brazas</em> distant from the said house, where he broke the lock of the said trunk and  took possession of all of its  contents,  namely, P86,  a razor, two pairs of trousers, and a shirt, of the value of about P6, which property belongs to the said Vy-Chiong.   The trunk was found in the said field and recovered by  its owner. The above crime was committed within the jurisdiction  of this court.  All contrary to law."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The guilt of the  accused of the crime with which he  is charged  is established by the testimony of record beyond a  reasonable doubt.  The facts alleged  and proven  constitute the crime of  robbery, as defined and penalized in the last paragraph of article 508 of the Penal Code, taken together with paragraph  4 of the said article, because  it does not appear that the accused was armed at the time of the perpetration of the robbery, or that  the value of the property stolen exceeded 1,250 pesetas.   The penalty  prescribed by the above-cited provisions of article  508 is the minimum degree  of <em>presidio correccional</em> in its  medium degree to <em>presidio mayor</em> in its minimum degree—that  is to say, presidio correctional in its medium degree [divided into three periods]—and no aggravating or extenuating circumstances having been alleged or proven, this penalty should be imposed in  its  medium degree.   The medium degree of <em>presidio correccional</em> in its medium degree [divided  into three]  is from two years eleven  months  and eleven days to three years six months and twenty days of <em>presidio correccional</em>.</p>
<p>The trial court imposed the penalty of eight years and one day  of <em>prision correccional</em> without subsidiary imprisonment,  and the payment of. the costs of the trial.</p>
<p>The judgment of the  trial court should be,  and is therefore,  reversed, and the accused  should  be, and is hereby,  sentenced to three years  <em>presidio  correccional,</em> with the accessory penalties prescribed by law, to the indemnification of the owner of the property in the sum of P94, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to the payment of the costs in  both instances.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Wiliard,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
