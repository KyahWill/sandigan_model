				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On the 8th day of March, 1906, in an action pending in the Court  of First Instance of Manila  in which Robert &amp; Guam is were the plaintiifs and Meyer Herman  was the defendant,  a final judgment was entered  in favor of the defendant.   On the 14th dav of March of the same year the plaintiff's made a motion for a new trial on the ground that the findings of the court were plainly and manifestly against the weight  of the  evidence.  It does not appear that any order was made upon this motion.  On the 26th day of March the. plaintiffs made another motion asking that the decision be set aside and that  the case be opened for the purpose  of  taking  the testimony of Dr. Altman, and  for such other proceedings as the court might deem just and equitable.  Notice was given that  this motion would  be heard on the 31st day  of March, which  was the last day of the term of court.   Nothing appearing to the contrary, we assume that the motion was argued on that day.  It was not decided, however, until the 14th day of April, and  after the term at which the judgment had been entered had closed.  The order  then made was  that the case be reopened  for the purpose of receiving the testimony of Dr. Altman, the court saying in its order that there was no showing that this evidence was newly discovered.  On the 12th day of July, 1906, the defendant in the case in the court below, Meyer Herman,  commenced this   original action  of <em>certiorari</em> in this  court, claiming that the order made in the court below on  the 14th day of April  was void because at  that  time that court had  no jurisdiction  to enter!ain or decide a motion for u new trial, the term at which the judgment was  entered having expired. The defendants in this original action have demurred to the complaint and the case  is now before the court for the resolution of the demurrer.</p>
<p>The  contention of the plaintiff  that  at the expiration of the term the court was without jurisdiction to entertain or decide a motion for a new trial can not be sustained in view of I he decision of  this court in the case of Santos <em>vs</em>. Villafuerte<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> (4 Off. Gaz., 850).</p>
<p>In that case and other cases cited therein, it was  held that4he Court of First Instance had jurisdiction to entertain and decide a motion for a new trial after the term at  which  the  decision was  rendered  had  expired.   The ruling announced in those cases disposes of this case.</p>
<p>Whether the order made on t!ie 14th of April was right or  wrong is not before us for decision.   The  court' had jurisdiction to decide the motion, even if it  were a motion for a new trial, a point which we do not detenu inc.   If it decided it incorrectly, the plaintiff, who was the defendant in  that  case, had the right  to except  to  the order  and, although he could  not  bring the case here  at once for decision because that order was not  a  final  judgment, yet he  could  do bo after final judgment had been entered and could then have the order in question reviewed.</p>
<p>The demurrer is  sustained  and the plaintiff  is allowed ten days from  the  notification of this order  in which to amend  his complaint.   If no amended complaint is  presented  within  that time the  clerk will,  without  further order from this court,  enter final judgment  in this case in favor of the defendants, with  costs.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Carson,</em> and  <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<em>Johnson, J.,</em> dissents.<br>
