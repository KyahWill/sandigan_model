				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance in an 
election contest for the office of governor of the Province of Ambos 
Camarines.
<p>During the pendency of the appeal the appellee presented a motion praying 
that the bond given by the protestant in the court below be increased to P10,000 
for the purpose of covering the extraordinary costs and expenses which he had 
incurred during the pendency of the protest. The appellant presented a motion 
praying that the decision of the lower court be declared null and that the cause 
be remanded to the court whence it came in order that a lawful and valid 
judgment may be rendered. Both of said motions were submitted to the court.</p>
<p>With reference to the second motion, the important facts necessary for a 
resolution of the same may be stated as follows:</p>
<p>1. That on the 6th day of June, 1916, an election was held for the office of 
governor of the Province of Ambos Camarines.</p>
<p>2. That after the close of said election the votes were canvassed, and on the 
21st day of June, 1916, the appellant was declared elected governor by the 
provincial board of canvassers.</p>
<p>3. That a protest against said election was duly filed on the 1st day of 
July, 1916, in the Court of First Instance of said province by the appellee.</p>
<p>4. That notice of said protest was duly given, issue was joined, a trial was 
had, the respective parties were duly heared and presented their proof; that the 
trial was closed, and the cause was finally submitted to the court for decision, 
and a decision was filed with the clerk on the 27th day of April, 1917, notice 
of which was duly given to the parties on the 30th day of April, 1917.</p>
<p>The contention of the appellant, as shown by his motion, is that at the time 
said decision was filed with the clerk the judge who prepared and filed it was 
not a judge of the court, neither <em>de jure</em> nor <em>de facto</em>. The 
facts relating to that contention may be stated briefly as follows:</p>
<p>1. That for sometime prior to the 31st day of March, 1917, the judge who 
filed said decision was one of the auxiliary judges of the Court of First 
Instance of the Province of Ambos Camarines.</p>
<p>2. That said judge, on the 31st day of March, 1917, having theretofore 
(January 27, 1917) been appointed Director of the Bureau of Lands (<em>see</em> 
Exhibit 4), took the oath of office as such Director of Lands.</p>
<p>3. That Candelario Borja, having been appointed auxiliary judge of the Courts 
of First Instance of the Fourth Group, including the Province of Ambos 
Camarines, took the oath of office on the 16th day of March, 1917, and entered 
upon the performance of his duty as such auxiliary judge of said province on the 
28th day of March, 1917.</p>
<p>Considering, therefore, the fact, that the judge, who filed the decision in 
question upon the 27th day of April, 1917, had taken the oath of office as 
Director of Lands on the 31st day of March, 1917, and began to draw his salary 
as such Director of Lands from the 28th day of March, 1917, in relation with the 
fact that his successor was appointed and had entered upon the performance of 
his duties as auxiliary judge on the 28th day of March, 1917, in substitution of 
the judge who filed the said decision, and there being no law providing for two 
auxiliary judges of the Court of First Instance of said province, we must 
conclude that, prior to the 27th day of April, 1917, said judge had ceased to be 
auxiliary judge of said province and was, therefore, without authority to 
promulgate decisions in said province. (Lino Luna <em>vs</em>. Rodriguez and De 
los Angeles, p. 186, <em>ante</em>. The judge who filed the decision cannot be 
considered a judge <em>de jure</em>, for the reason that another judge was 
actually acting in his place and stead and had been for nearly a month prior to 
the promulgation of the decision in question on the 27th day of April, 1917. 
Neither can he be considered a judge <em>de facto</em>, for the reason that 
there was a <em>de jure</em> judge actually discharging the functions of the 
office in question. (McCahon <em>vs</em>. Leavenworth County Commissioners, 8 
Kan., 293; Powers <em>vs</em>. Commonwealth, 110 Ky., 386; 53 L. R. A., 245; 
Hallgren <em>vs</em>. Campbell, 82 Mich., 255; 21 Am. St. Rep., 557; 9 L. R. A., 
408; Baker <em>vs</em>. Hobgood, 126 N. C, 149; 29 Cyc, 1391.) There cannot be a 
<em>de facto</em> judge when there is a <em>de jure</em> judge in the actual 
performance of the duties of the office. (McCahon <em>vs</em>. Leavenworth 
County Commissioners, 8 Kan., 293.) In order to be a <em>de facto</em> judge he 
must still be acting under some color of right. He cannot be actually acting 
under any color of right when he has ceased to be judge and has actually vacated 
the office by the acceptance of another office and by actually entering upon the 
duties of the other office. (Lino Luna <em>vs</em>. Rodriguez and De los 
Angeles, p. 186, <em>ante</em>; 29 Cyc, 1391; Coopwood <em>vs</em>. Prewett, 30 
Miss., 206; Smith <em>vs</em>. Baugh, 32 Ind., 163; Ketcham <em>vs</em>. Hill, 
42 Ind., 64.) A judgment rendered by a judge after he has ceased to be judge and 
who has vacated his office, will be set aside on motion. (Cain <em>vs</em>. 
Libby, 32 Min., 491.) Where the term of office of a judge has terminated and his 
successor has qualified and <em>he has ceased to act as judge</em> his 
subsequent acts in attempting to dispose of business left unfinished by him 
before the expiration of his term are void. (State <em>vs</em>. Perkins, 139 
Mo., 106; United States <em>vs</em>. Alexander, 46 Fed., 728.)</p>
<p>For all of the foregoing reasons, the decision and judgment of the lower 
court is hereby revoked, annulled and set aside, and it is hereby ordered and 
decreed that the record be returned to the court whence it came with direction 
that the judge thereof proceed at once to render a decision and judgment upon 
the evidence heretofore adduced and made a part of the record, in accordance 
with the law and the facts. In view of the conclusion which we have just 
reached, it is hereby ordered and decreed that the motion for an increase of the 
bond be referred to the lower court for decision, and without any finding as to 
costs. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Carson, Araullo, Street, Malcolm, Avance√±a</em>, 
and <em>Fisher, JJ.</em>, concur.</p></div>
