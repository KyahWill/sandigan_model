				G.R. No. 4282, August 18, 1908</h4>
				<H3>THE  UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS.. CHIONG CHUICO, YAP-YNTING, CHIONG-CANG, YAP-SUANGCO, LIM QUI, UY-JAN-LLING,  AND LIM-TIONGCO, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS. <BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In each of the seven&nbsp; cases above-mentioned, the defendant was convicted for selling opium in violation of Act No. 1461.&nbsp; The evidence of the Government sufficiently proved the offense in each case.&nbsp; No evidence was offered by the&nbsp; defendants, except that of two&nbsp; witnesses, one the defendant Lim-Qui.&nbsp; On cross-examination he was asked what was the substance contained in the small can then in&nbsp; court,&nbsp; which the witnesses&nbsp; for the Government had testified was bought from him.&nbsp; His counsel objected to the question, the court overruled the&nbsp; objection, and directed&nbsp; the&nbsp; witness&nbsp; to&nbsp; answer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thereupon&nbsp; his counsel withdrew him from the stand&nbsp; and asked&nbsp; to&nbsp; have&nbsp; all the testimony given by him stricken from the record.<br><br>The only other witness was Du-Buntiong, who was tried at the same time with the seven defendants above-mentioned, but who did not appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp; His testimony related to the sale by himself,&nbsp; and&nbsp; there was nothing in it which could relate to the&nbsp; other defendants, except some statements about the private character of one of the witnesses for the Government.<br><br>The testimony of the&nbsp; prosecution was, therefore, uncontradicted.&nbsp; The fact that the&nbsp; witnesses for the Government made the purchases of opium for the purpose of securing evidence to convict the defendants of a violation of the law, did not make them accomplices in&nbsp; the crime,&nbsp; and their testimony stands as the testimony of any other witness in a&nbsp; case. (Commonwealth <i>vs.</i> Baker, 155 Mass., 287.)<br><br>The judgment of the court below in each case above mentioned is affirmed, with&nbsp; one-seventh of the costs of this instance against each one of the seven defendants. So ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Carson, </i>and <i>Tracey, JJ.,</i> concur. </div>
