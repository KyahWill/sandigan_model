				<h4>
				G.R. No. 8983, March 07, 1914</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. EULOGIO EDPALINA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The facts disclosed by the record in this case are substantially similar to 
those in the case of United States <em>vs.</em> Labadan (26 Phil. Rep., 239), 
recently decided by this court, and under our ruling in that case, it is clear 
that the defendant and appellant is not guilty of the offense of which he was 
convicted in the court below.
<p>It appears from the record that plea of "guilty" was entered in the court 
below, but we are satisfied that this plea, read together with the statements of 
the accused at the trial, was not in fact a plea of guilty of the offense 
charged, and was intended to be no more than an admission that the accused had 
taken the elector's oath on the date set out in the information, and that he had 
not paid his land taxes for 1911 at that time. But as was shown in the former 
case, such an admission did not amount to a plea of guilt of the offense 
charged, and proof of the facts thus admitted would not sustain a conviction. In 
view of the statements made by the accused the trial judge should have ordered 
the substitution of a plea of "not guilty" for that of "guilty" as entered in 
the record.</p>
<p>The judgment of conviction entered in the court below should be reversed and 
the accused acquitted of the offense with which he is charged in the 
information, with the costs of both instances de officio. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Moreland, Trent,</em> and <em>Araullo,JJ,.</em> 
concur.</p>
<p><em>Judgment reversed; defendant acquitted.</em><br></p></div>
