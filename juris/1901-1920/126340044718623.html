				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Mariano Lamberto died  in Tacloban in the Province of Leyte on the 9th day of April, 1889, leaving surviving him his widow, the defendant and appellant, Claudia  Mendiola, and his mother as his only heirs.   In his will he stated that all the property of  which he died possessed had been acquired during his marriage with the appellant and belonged to the conjugal partnership.   He left two-thirds of his estate to his mother  and an interest in the other third to Justiniano  Mendiola, his stepson,  the son of  the defendant.  Voluntary  proceedings were  commenced in the Court  of First Instance of Leyte for a settlement of the estate in accordance with the provisions of the Law of Civil Procedure then in force.   While such proceedings were pending,  and on the 6th day of November, 1889), the defendant and  appellant, the mother, Silveria  Melendres, and Justiniano Mendiola,  the  stepson, made1 an agreement which appears in a notarial document by which they abandoned the  proceeding in the Court of First  Instance1, settled the estate and  divided the property among themselves.  YBy the terms of this agreement, tin1 appellant took possession of all the property, agreeing to pay the  debts, and agreed to, and did, pay in the act of execution of the document to the mother,  Silveria Melendres, 2,400 pesos,  and to Justiniano Mendiola 1,200 pesos.  Ever since  that time  the appellant  has  been in possession of the property  and has paid all  the debts of the deceased and  of  the conjugal  partnership.  It will be noticed that she was in her own right the owner of one-half of the property, subject to the payment of such debts.</p>
<p>On the 25th of April, 1904, nearly fifteen years after this settlement,  Justiniano Mendiola and  Juliana  Lamberto, the daughter of  Silveria  Melendres, presented a  petition to the Court of First Instance of Leyte asking that the will of Mariano  Lamberto  be proved and allowed and that an administrator be appointed to administer  the estate  of the deceased.  Claudia Mendiola appeared  and opposed the probate of the will on the ground that the estate had been completely  settled and a partition of  the property belonging thereto  had been  made  fifteen  years before. The court below granted the  prayer of the  petition and appointed an administrator.   From this order Claudia Mendiola  has appealed.</p>
<p>Nearly all the evidence in the case and nearly all of the opinion of the court below  is devoted to a consideration of the  validity of the partition made in 1881).   That was practically the only question discussed and determined by the court  below, the petitioners and appellees claiming that this partition  had been obtained by fraud and  misrepresentations on  the part of the appellant as to the value of the property  left by her husband and as to the debts existing against his estate.</p>
<p>We do  not find  it necessary to consider the evidence adduced on tin1 question of fraud, nor the findings made by the court below in relation thereto, for we are of the opinion that when it  appeared to that court that there had been a partition of the property made by the heirs, all of whom were  of age, that lie should have dismissed the proceedings, leaving the  parties to litigate the question as to the validity of that contract of  partition in an  ordinary action brought for that purpose.  The proceeding commenced in the  Court of First Instance of Leyte in  1889 was a voluntary proceeding.  Article 1080 of the Spanish Law of Civil Procedure provided as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The interested parties may at  any stage of the voluntary probate proceedings, terminate them and adopt  such measures as they may  deem proper.</p>
  <p>"For this  purpose,  beside  the  heirs and legatees, the creditors who may have instituted the action  and the surviving  member of the  marriage community shall be considered as  interested parties.</p>
  <p>"If they pray for such termination  by common consent, the judge shall  order the proceedings terminated and shall place the property at the disposition of the heirs."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The  contract made  by  the parties  in this case states expressly that they abandoned the voluntary  proceedings.</p>
<p>That  contract contains, moreover the following clause:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Seventh. As a consequence of the foregoing clause, Silveria  Melendres and  Justiniano Lamberto  do  hereby solemnly declare themselves to  be entirely satisfied  with their share of  the estate  and waive  whatever right  they may have to the property of the estate, and by these presents  undertake in the  most solemn manner not to make any claim  in future in respect to the said property, and hereby convey  to  Claudia.  Mendiola   whatever  property, interest, or rights  they  may have in  the estate  of the deceased, she, in turn, agreeing to  pay all the  debts of the estate as well as all the legacies and bequeathments  provided for in the will of the deceased."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When neither minors nor creditors were interested  in the settlement  of an estate, no action of  the court  was necessary, in accordance with the law existing here prior to American occupation.  Everything was  in  the hands of the heirs and legatees and they could dispose  of the property as they saw. fit.  Article 1058 of the Civil Code is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Should the testator  not have made any division, nor intrusted this  power  to another, if the heirs  should be of age and should have  the free administration of their property, they may distribute the estate in the manner they may see fit."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where the parties in fact signed an agreement of partition and the partition was in fact made in accordance with that agreement, all proceedings in court for the settlement of the estate of the  deceased person were ended.  The rights of the  parties  to  the  property involved  could no longer be  discussed nor determined  in that proceeding. If it  were claimed that the partition was brought about by fraud  or that it was  void for any  other reason, such claims necessarily  had  to be presented in an  ordinary action brought for  the purpose  of  setting  aside  the partition.</p>
<p>Limiting ourselves  to  this precise  case, we  hold that where prior to the  adoption  of the present Code of Civil Procedure a contract  of  partition has in fact  been made by all the persons  interested in  the estate of  a deceased person, such persons interested being of full age and capacity to contract, no further proceedings can be had for the judicial settlement and administration of  that  property until  the  contract  of  partition has  been set aside in an ordinary action brought for  that  purpose,  and that in this case,  when it was made to appear to the court below that such a contract of partition had  in fact been signed by the petitioners or their grantors, the court should have dismissed the petition.</p>
<p>The judgment of the  court  below is reversed and  the case remanded  to that court with instructions to dismiss the petition, with  costs to the appellant, Claudia Mendiola.  No costs will  be  allowed to either party in this court.  After the expiration of twenty days,  let judgment be entered  accordingly,  and ten  days thereafter the case be returned to the lower court for execution.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa,  Carson,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em>Johnson, J.,</em> did not sit in this  case.<br>
