				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The defendant was charged with the crime of <em>bandolerismo</em> and was 
tried by the Court of First Instance of the Province of Bulacan on the 29th day 
of September, 1903, and was sentenced to be imprisoned for the term of twenty 
years and to pay the costs of the suit.
<p>Various witnesses were sworn on behalf of the prosecution. Mr. Melville A. 
Hayes testified that he knew the accused and that he was a member of a band of 
ladrones. The defendant confessed to him voluntarily and without promise of 
reward that he, together with Valentin Avena, Emeterio Avendaña, Lorenzo de la 
Cruz, and others stole eight carabaos, the property of one Fabian Gallego, which 
carabaos were in a corral at Sapang-Palay, of the pueblo of San Jose, in the 
month of May, 1903.</p>
<p>Segundo Gallego testified that he was the son of Fabian Gallego and lived in 
Sapang-Palay, of the pueblo of San Jose; that he was in charge of the eight 
carabaos of his father, which were stolen; that the carabaos were stolen from 
his corral by five armed persons about the first of May, 1903.</p>
<p>Fabian Gallego testified that he was the father of Segundo Gallego; that he 
was the owner of eight carabaos that were in the possession of his son at 
Sapang-Palay; that the carabaos had been stolen in the latter part of the month 
of April or in the first part of the month of May, 1903; that he recovered the 
carabaos from the possession of the Philippine Scouts on or about the 5th day of 
May,1903.</p>
<p>Leandro Santos testified that he was an Inspector of the Philippines 
Constabulary and knew the accused; that the accused at the time of his arrest 
had made a confession, freely and voluntarily and without the promise of a 
reward of any character whatever; that he and his companions had stolen the 
eight carabaos in question and that he and his companions were armed with two 
guns and a war bolo and other short bolos; that this confession was reduced to 
writing and was signed by the defendant, by himself, and one Luna. The 
confession was in the following language:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"My name is Apolonio Natividad. I am a Filipino, native of the town of Santa 
Maria, Bulacan, 19 years of age, married, a farmer, and live in the barrio of 
Halang of the town of Santa Maria. I swear before First Lieut. Chas. E. Dority, 
commanding officer of the Twenty-fourth Company of Ilocano Scouts, that I am a 
member of a band of brigands composed of my companions Valentin Avena, Lorenzo 
Concepcion, Emeterio Avendafia, Feliciano de la Cruz, and Prudencio Cristobal, 
residents of the same barrio of Halang of the towns of San Jose and Santa Maria, 
respectively.</p>
<p>"I also declare that I and my companions Valentin Avena, Lorenzo Concepcion, 
Feliciano de la Cruz, and Prudencio Cristobal stole eight carabaos at a place 
called Sapang-Palay of the town of San Jose (Bulacan) and after we took the said 
carabaos we invited one of our own companions called Emeterio Avendaña, resident 
of the barrio of Halang, San Jose, to accompany us to take the said carabaos to 
the town of Novaliches, Rizal, where we delivered them to the parties named 
Captain Cirilo and Cabeza Angel, both residents of the same town of Novaliches, 
Province of Rizal.</p>
<p>"I swear, and, being unable to sign, place a cross in the middle of my 
name.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"APOLONIO (his x mark) 
NATIVIDAD.</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>"Witnesses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"URBANO C. LUNA.</p>
<p>"LEANDRO SANTOS."</p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>After the accused made the foregoing confession he told him (Santos) where 
the guns had been hidden in the middle of a cogon field to which place he 
conducted him.</p>
<p>Urbano Luna testified that he knew the defendant and was a prisoner in the 
same carcel with him in the month of May, 1903; that he heard the defendant make 
a confession that he in company with others stole eight carabaos at Sapang-Palay 
of the pueblo' of San Jose; that this confession was made to Leandro Santos, 
voluntarily and that Santos made no threats or promises of reward whatever; that 
he acted as interpreter; that after the confession was made and reduced to 
writing that the accused read it, or rather it was read to him, and he thereupon 
signed it; that he recognized the above-quoted confession as the document which 
was signed by the defendant after it had been read to him; that the defendant 
said his companions were Valentin Avena, Feliciano de la Cruz, Lorenzo 
Concepcion and others whose names he did not remember.</p>
<p>The defendant was sworn in his own behalf and stated that he made the 
confession quoted above but that he was abused and maltreated by Leandro Santos 
and was threatened with death and that he made the confession on that account 
and that he told Leandro Santos where the guns were because of the same 
treatment.</p>
<p>The court below found as a fact, after hearing the evidence, that the 
confession made by the defendant that he, together with five others, had stolen 
the eight carabaos, had been made voluntarily and without any promise or hope of 
reward; this finding of fact was clearly justified on the proof adduced in the 
case.</p>
<p>The facts adduced in the case justify the following conclusions :</p>
<p>First. That the defendant was a member of a band that went out upon the 
highways armed with deadly weapons and roamed over the country for the purpose 
of stealing carabaos and other personal property. </p>
<p>Second. That the said band did go out upon the highways and roam over the 
country armed with deadly weapons and that in the latter part of the month of 
April or the first part of the month of May, 1903, stole eight carabaos of one 
Segundo Gallego.</p>
<p>Under the foregoing facts the court below found the defendant guilty of the 
crime of <em>bandolerismo,</em> under section 1 of Act No. 518 of the Civil 
Commission. This sentence was justified by the facts adduced in the case and the 
judgment of the court below is hereby affirmed and the said defendant is hereby 
sentenced to be imprisoned for the term of twenty years and to pay the costs of 
this suit.</p>
