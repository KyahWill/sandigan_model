				<BR><STRONG>MAPA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The appellants herein presented a claim for 2,890.59 pesos to the committee&nbsp; of&nbsp; appraisal of the estate of Victorino Buhay, which they allege was due by the deceased to their principal, Telesforo Chuidian, together with interest thereon at the rate of 10 per&nbsp; cent per annum from the&nbsp; 9th of February, 1898, when the debt&nbsp; was&nbsp; contracted,&nbsp; and 180.66 pesos in addition thereto on account of a certain&nbsp; commission agreed to in. favor of the creditor, Chuidian.&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently the last-named amount was remitted, whereby&nbsp; their claim was reduced to the two items first mentioned.<br><br>The court below ordered the administrator of the estate to pay the sums claimed.&nbsp; The said order is&nbsp; as follows:<br><blockquote>"While the court was in full&nbsp; session this administrator admitted the contract which the plaintiff&nbsp; claims had been entered into with the deceased while living.&nbsp; Upon examination of said&nbsp; contract it was shown that Buhay owed the heirs&nbsp; of&nbsp; Chuidian&nbsp; the sum of 2,890.59 pesos and also the sum of 2,910.55 pesos for interest&nbsp; up to the&nbsp; 6th of March, 1908,&nbsp; with interest thenceforth on&nbsp; the principal amount at the rate of 10 per cent per annum until payment is made.<br><br>"Said&nbsp; contract was made&nbsp; in&nbsp; Mexican currency and it should be converted into Philippine currency at the official ratio&nbsp; established by the Government&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Philippine Islands&nbsp; on this date.<br><br>"This claim with respect to&nbsp; the amount already referred to is&nbsp; hereby approved,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the administrator&nbsp; is hereby ordered to pay the said sum immediately."</blockquote>The plaintiffs excepted to the above order solely in&nbsp; so far as it ordered the conversion of Mexican into Philippine currency at the official ratio which, according to said order, ruled at the time when the order was&nbsp; issued.<br><br>The fact&nbsp; established by the trial court that the debt had been contracted in Mexican currency is neither denied nor discussed in the brief of the appellants, nor is the propriety of converting the obligation into&nbsp; Philippine currency discussed.&nbsp; The only objection made by them is to the conversion at the official ratio mentioned in the order appealed from, maintaining that it should be done at par.&nbsp; And they allege&nbsp; as a&nbsp; reason and basis for their pretension that the administrator of Buhay's estate made no objection to the admittance&nbsp; of the&nbsp; debt, as it appears in the account marked as Exhibit&nbsp; A (p. 11 of the bill of exceptions), when the matter was&nbsp; brought before the commissioners for appraisal, the amounts being stated therein in figures with the proper sign for Philippine currency.&nbsp; In&nbsp; support of&nbsp; said allegation they insert in their brief a copy&nbsp; of the record of the appearance&nbsp; before the commissioners&nbsp; for appraisal which, among other things, literally reads "<i>that the administrator admits the document presented by the other party acknowledging at the same time&nbsp; the&nbsp; credit therein stated for</i> P2,890.59 3/8."&nbsp; The document herein referred to is the account marked as Exhibit A which has just been mentioned.<br><br>The record of appearance before the commissioners for appraisal has not&nbsp; been submitted to this&nbsp; court, nor was it made a part of the bill of exceptions which we have before us, for which reason we can not take it into account&nbsp; in rendering a decision in this matter.&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp; court can not base its decisions on&nbsp; evidence which is&nbsp; not before&nbsp; it,&nbsp; it being of course the duty of the appellants to&nbsp; take all the necessary steps to have the same submitted to this&nbsp; court in those cases An&nbsp; which is desired, and the&nbsp; law grants, a review of&nbsp; the evidence.<br><br>As to the rest,&nbsp; if&nbsp; the said document or&nbsp; record of appearance were to be considered, it would be seen that there is nothing therein to support the&nbsp; pretension of the appellants,&nbsp; inasmuch as&nbsp; the&nbsp; figures which represent the amounts are not indicated with the proper sign of the Philippine&nbsp; currency.&nbsp; The Philippine&nbsp; peso is&nbsp; represented&nbsp; by means of this sign: "P"&nbsp; (Executive Order&nbsp; No. 66, August 3, 1903), and&nbsp; that&nbsp; used&nbsp; in the above-cited record&nbsp; is this other:&nbsp; "P;" this last sign is certainly in use to signify pesos, but&nbsp; pesos in general, not&nbsp; particularly Philippine pesos.<br><br>The same must be said with respect to the account, Exhibit A, ajid it should further be noted that therein&nbsp; the signs "$"&nbsp; and "P"&nbsp; are used indiscriminately, which fact shows that the parties did not attach much&nbsp; importance nor pay much attention to the question of signs,&nbsp; apparently considering it as a matter of small&nbsp; consequence.&nbsp; It is well known&nbsp; that&nbsp; the sign&nbsp; "$" indicates money&nbsp; of the&nbsp; United States,&nbsp; as recognized in Executive Order&nbsp; No. QQ,&nbsp; above cited.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is true, that in the copy of said Exhibit A, which appears at page 11 of the printed bill of exceptions, there appears the sign "P," but this is evidently an error in copying&nbsp; or on the part of&nbsp; the printer, because,&nbsp; in the original (p. 12), the said sign does not appear, but shows the letter "P." Therefore,&nbsp; the&nbsp; allegation of the appellants,&nbsp; which the&nbsp; appellee has denied in his brief, that&nbsp; the latter had agreed to pay the&nbsp; debt in Philippine currency on the basis of one&nbsp; Philippine peso for one Mexican peso, at par,&nbsp; is unfounded.<br><br>The order appealed&nbsp; from&nbsp; directs a&nbsp; conversion&nbsp; of the Mexican currency into Philippine&nbsp; currency at the&nbsp; official rate established by the Government&nbsp; and in force on the date of said order&nbsp; (March 6, 1908).&nbsp; The&nbsp; order is erroneous and&nbsp; should be revoked.&nbsp; Section 7&nbsp; of the Act of Congress of March 2, 1903, provides as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"That the Mexican silver dollar now in use in the Philippine Islands and the silver coins heretofore issued&nbsp; by the Spanish Government for&nbsp; use&nbsp; in said Islands shall&nbsp; be receivable for public dues at a&nbsp; rate to be fixed from time to time by the&nbsp; proclamation of the&nbsp; Civil&nbsp; Governor of said Islands&nbsp; until such date, not earlier than the first&nbsp; day of January, nineteen&nbsp; hundred and four, as may be fixed&nbsp; by public proclamation of said Civil Governor, when such coins shall cease to be so receivable."<br></blockquote><br>By virtue of this provision, Executive Order No. 1, dated January 1, 1904, was issued providing that "The&nbsp; Insular Treasurer and each provincial treasurer in the Philippine Islands shall&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; exchange on demand&nbsp; Philippine currency&nbsp; for said Spanish-Filipino currency <i>at such rates as the Insular Government&nbsp; may, from&nbsp; time to time,&nbsp; determine." </i><br><br>Such was the purpose in fixing said rates: that it might serve as a basis or official standard in exchanging at&nbsp; the treasuries the&nbsp; so-called local currency for Philippine currency during the period while the said local currency should be received in payment of dues, it being&nbsp; the duty&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Insular Government to fix the date when it should cease to be so receivable.&nbsp; And the said date was fixed by&nbsp; the Government by Executive Order No. 8 of March 11, 1907, providing that "from the 1st day of July, 1907, the&nbsp; Insular Treasurer and all provincial treasurers shall cease to redeem the&nbsp; silver coins&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; * *"&nbsp;&nbsp; (Spanish-Filipino,&nbsp; Mexican, etc.).<br><br>The redemption of the local currency having been thus prohibited, the reason&nbsp; for the official ratio between said currency and the Philippine currency ceased; consequently no official rate of exchange whatever&nbsp; existed on the&nbsp; 6th of March, 1908, when the order appealed from was rendered, for the reason that it had&nbsp; been&nbsp; abolished.&nbsp; As no such ratio existed at the time, it can hardly serve as a basis, even though it&nbsp; be supplementary, for the conversion of Mexican into&nbsp; Philippine currency; the order above alluded&nbsp; to can not therefore be sustained with reference to this point.<br><br>In order that the true equivalent of the&nbsp; two above-mentioned classes of currency may be established, the contending parties should be given an opportunity to present evidence in connection with the matter in the manner provided by section S of Act No. 1045 of the Philippine Commission, inasmuch&nbsp; as the debt was contracted in Mexican currency, and the payment must be ordered in Philippine currency, precisely in accordance with said Act.<br><br>The order appealed from is hereby set aside in so far as&nbsp; it directs that&nbsp; the&nbsp; amount claimed be converted into Philippine currency at the official ratio said to be ruling on the 6th of March, 1908; a new trial shall be held for the sole purpose of permitting the parties to present evidence as to the actual value of the Mexican money as compared with Philippine currency, which shall serve as a basis for the&nbsp; reduction of the said debt to Philippine&nbsp; currency as must be ordered in the judgment to be rendered. Without special finding as to costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson</i>, and <i>Carson, JJ.,</i> concur.<br></div>
