				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The  complaint charges the defendant with the crime of seduction (<em>estupro</em>)  of a  woman over 12  and under 23 years of age, as denned and penalized in  article 443 of the Penal Code, which is as follows:</p>
<p>"The seduction of a virgin over 12 and under 23 years of age, committed by any public authority, priest,  servant, domestic, guardian, teacher, or by any person in charge of her education or  guardianship,  under any name whatsoever, shall be punished with  the penalty of <em>prision  correctional</em> in its minimum and  medium degrees.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Whosoever shall commit incest with his sister or descendant, even though she were older than 23 years of age, shall incur the same penalty.</p>
  <p>"Seduction, when committed with fraud by any  other person  on a woman over 12 years of age, but under 23, shall be punished with the penalty of <em>arresto mayor</em>.</p>
  <p>"Any other unchaste abuse committed by the same persons  and under similar circumstances  shall be punished with  the same penalty."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is  alleged that the defendant seduced Teofila Sevilla under promise of marriage early in the year 1902, at which time  she  was less than 21  years of age.   The complaint was not filed until  February, 1906, when she was  more than  24 though less than 25 years of age,  and was signed, sworn,  and submitted by one Esteban  Sevilla,  at whose "instance" these proceedings were had, he appearing as the private prosecutor and alleging that  he is the father of the said Teofila Sevilla.</p>
<p>The facts as to the age of the woman were developed at the trial of the case and are not controverted.</p>
<p>We think that since the complaint was not filed  until after the offended party had attained her majority, criminal proceedings based  on  the alleged  seduction  could  only be instituted and maintained at her "instance," and she, and she alone, could file a complaint  which  would give the trial court jurisdiction over the offense charged.   The complaint having  been filed by her father, at whose  instance the proceedings in  this case were had,  the  trial court had no jurisdiction over the offense  charged,  and its judgment of conviction should be reversed and the complaint upon which it was based dismissed.  Article 448 of the Penal Code is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Criminal proceedings for seduction  can only be instituted on  the complaint of the offended person  or her parents, grandparents, or guardian.</p>
  <p>"In order to proceed in cases of rape,  and  in those of abduction  committed with  unchaste design,  the  denunciation of the. interested party, her parents, grandparents, or guardians, shall suffice even though they do not present a formal petition to the judge.</p>
  <p>"If the person injured should, by reason of her age or mental condition, lack  the requisite personality to  appear in court, and should, besides, be wholly unprotected, not having parents, grandparents, brothers,  or  guardian of person or property to denounce the crime, the <em>procurador sindico</em> or the public prosecutor may do so, acting on the strength  of public rumor.</p>
  <p>"In all the cases of this article the express or implied pardon of the offended party shall extinguish  penal action or the penalty,  if it should have been already imposed on the culprit.</p>
  <p>"The pardon shall  never be presumed, except by the marriage of the offended party with the offender."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is contended that these  provisions authorize the institution  of criminal proceedings by the father in all cases of seduction because the offense can only be committed upon a woman under age and legally incapacitated to institute  criminal proceedings on  her own behalf.  But if the father does  not institute such proceedings until after his daughter has attained full age, we are of opinion that he loses the right so to do, and that this right vests exclusively  in the offended party, unless, of course, there is some legal impediment, not arising out  of nonage, which prevents her from maintaining such criminal action.</p>
<p>The right to institute criminal proceedings in cases of seduction could not be reposed in the offended person, her parents, grandparents, and guardian, at one and the same time, without occasioning grave difficulties in the administration  of justice, resulting from the attempts of some of these persons to institute criminal proceedings contrary to the wish and desire of the others; and  that this was not the intention  of the lawmaker becomes manifest in the light of the peculiar provisions of the above-cited article of the Penal Code, whereby the offended party  is given the right to pardon the  offender and  thus extinguish  and destroy the cause of the criminal  action, or remit the penalty prescribed by law, where judgment of conviction has been actually pronounced and sentence imposed.</p>
<p>Hence,  although these persons are mentioned disjunctively, the above  provision of the Penal Code must be  construed as meaning that the  right to institute criminal proceedings in cases of seduction is <em>exclusively </em>and <em>successively</em> reposed in these persons in the order in which they are named, so that no one of them has authority to proceed if there is any other person previously mentioned therein with legal capacity to appear and institute the action.</p>
<p>This construction of the law imposes upon the woman the obligation and the right to determine whether criminal proceedings shall be instituted for seduction, if it appears that she is of age? and is not otherwise legally incapacitated from appearing in  court  to maintain the action at  the time when it is proposed to institute such proceedings.</p>
<p>Under  the provisions of the Civil Code, a woman 23 years old is of age.  From that period she is in  the full possession of her civil  rights,  save only in  certain  exceptional cases expressly prescribed in the  code.  The right to appear and prosecute or defend an action in  the courts is not one of these exceptions and, indeed, it is inherent  to the full exercise of civil rights.  (For  the purpose of this decision it is not necessary to  consider the effect of American legislation as modifying this provision by reducing the number of years at which a woman  becomes of  age.)</p>
<p>Since the offended party in this case was  over 23 but less than  25 years of age at the time when the complaint was  filed, it may be well  to add that article 321 of the Civil Code, which is as follows—</p>
<p>"*  *   *  Daughters of the family who are of full age but less than 25 years old can not abandon the paternal roof without permission of the  father or of  the mother in whose company they live, unless it be to marry, or when the father or mother have contracted another marriage"— does not imply a limitation to the right of a woman of full age to appear and defend an action, nor confer authority upon the father to appear for and instead of his daughter in legal  proceedings,  for this  article,  since it  confers exceptional authority  on the  father,  must be construed strictly and should not be extended beyond its own proper terms  and the  object  and purposes indicated therein. (Decision of the supreme court of Spain, October 13,1890.) Counsel for the prosecution insists that since no objection  was made to the  complaint in  the court below, the appellant is not entitled to raise an objection thereto for the first time in this court, and should be held to have waived such objection by his failure to urge it in the trial court.  In support  of this contention, he cites  the case of the United  States <em>vs</em>. Sarabia (4  Phil. Rep.,  566), wherein this court, adopting the general rule in the United States, that an  objection to the complaint to be available in the appellate court must have been raised below, held "that no objection to  a complaint based upon a defective statement,.either in the matter of form or substance of <the acts="" or="" omissions="" complained="" as="" required="" by="" section="" 6,="" paragraph="" 3,="" of="" general="" orders,="" no.="" 58,="" not="" made="" court="" below="" will="" be="" available="" in="" the="" supreme="" court.=""></the></p>
<p>It is to be observed, however, that under the provisions of the above-cited article 448 of the Penal Code,  jurisdiction over the crime of seduction is expressly denied the trial court unless such jurisdiction be conferred by one of certain persons specified in the law; in this case, as we have seen, by the offended person herself.  The objection in this case is not, strictly speaking, to the sufficiency of the complaint, but goes directly to the jurisdiction of the court over the crime with which the accused was charged. It has been frequently held that a lack of jurisdiction over the subject-matter is  fatal,  and  subject to objection at any stage of the proceedings, either in the court below or on appeal (Ency. of PI. &amp; Pr., vol. 12,  p. 189, and large array of cases there cited), and, indeed, where the subject-matter is not within the jurisdiction, the court may dismiss the proceeding <em>ex mero motu</em>,   (4 I11., 133;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  190 Ind., 79; Chipman <em>vs</em>.  Waterbury,  59 Conn.,  496.)</p>
<p>Jurisdiction <em>over  the subject-matter</em> in a judicial proceeding is conferred  by  the  sovereign authority which organizes the court; it is given only by law and in the manner prescribed by  law and an objection based on the lack of such jurisdiction can not be waived by the parties. Hence, the accused in  a criminal case can not, by express waiver or otherwise,  confer jurisdiction on a court over an offense as to which such jurisdiction has not been conferred upon such court by law.   (Harkness <em>vs</em>. Hyde, 98 U. S., 476; Nazos <em>vs</em>. Cragin, 3  Dill (U. S.), 474; 3  Tex., 157;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 5 Mich., 331;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Ohio St., 223;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> 82 Wis., 644; 91 111., 311.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>)</p>
<p>Counsel  further contends that since the offended party appeared in court and testified, she may be said to have instituted the proceedings, as provided in article 448,  although the complaint is signed and sworn to by her father. It may be sufficient answer to this contention to point out that there is  nothing  in  the record to indicate that the proceedings  were,  in  fact,  had at the  instance  of the daughter rather than the father, the fact that she appeared and gave testimony not justifying such conclusion because, being duly subpoenaed, she would have been compelled  so to do whether she appeared voluntarily or otherwise; but, as has been shown before, the provisions of article 448 are so explicit and so positive that even though it appears that she had, in fact, taken an active part in all the proceedings, this would not be sufficient  unless the complaint was submitted and the action  formally maintained by  her.  That this  is the meaning of the  provisions of the said  article becomes clear upon a comparison of the language used  as to proceedings for seduction and proceedings in a case  of rape.   In proceedings  for  seduction  the language used expressly provides that they can  only be <em>instituted and maintained</em> on the complaint  (<em>a instancia</em>)  of the persons therein  mentioned;  while in  cases of rape and those  of abduction committed with dishonest designs,  the denunciation  (<em>la denuncia)</em> of  the interested party,  or her parents, grandparents, or guardian, shall  suffice, "though they do  not present a formal  complaint to  the judge" (<em>aunque no formalicen instancias</em>).   (U. S.  <em>vs</em>.  Santos, 4 Phil. Rep., 527.)</p>
<p>The judgment of conviction of the trial  court should be, and  is hereby, reversed and the complaint instituted  in these proceedings should be, and is hereby, dismissed, with the costs de oficio.   So ordered.</p>
