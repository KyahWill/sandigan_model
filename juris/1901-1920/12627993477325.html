				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. CLARO PAGUIO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.

				<BR><STRONG>MAPA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is a prosecution for the crime of brigandage alleged to have been committed as follows:  "That in or about the months of June to October, 1904, in the barrio of Cabcaben, Mariveles, Province of Bataan, P. I., the said Claro Paguio maliciously, unlawfully, and feloniously gave shelter in his own house and furnished food and money to a  band of more than three  men  armed with revolvers under  the leadership of one  Cosme Caro or another man named Simon, organized for the purpose of robbing and plundering the  inhabitants of the said  barrio, in violation of  the statute made and provided."</p>
<p>Several  witnesses  testified  for  the  prosecution.  The testimony of two of them is so incoherent and improbable that the court below was compelled to reject it  as inadmissible for  the purpose  of establishing  the  guilt of  the accused.</p>
<p>The testimony of the others was completely contradicted by a large number of witnesses called by the defense.  The trial  court, in weighing  the testimony of  the  witnesses both for the  prosecution  and the defense, stated that  the witnesses presented by  the accused were  in a better position to see and observe what happened daily in the defendant's house during the  time  referred to in the complaint, and proceeding upon this  theory, decided the doubt arising from such  conflicting testimony in favor of the defendant. We think that this conclusion of the trial court is correct and that it must, therefore, be sustained.</p>
<p>But even assuming that the testimony  of the witnesses for the prosecution was true, yet it could not be said that the men to whom,  according to them, the defendant furnished money and rice were really brigands, as the only reason, absolutely insufficient, which they gave for believing them such was that they were armed with  revolvers. There is no proof  of any  act of brigandage committed by them either before or during the long period they remained, according to  the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution, in the vicinity of the barrio of Cabcaben.  On the contrary one  of those witnesses testified that they were engaged in cultivating  the field.  On  the other hand,  it was proved at the trial that, at that time, Constabulary soldiers from Mariveles and Cavite, armed with revolvers, used to go to the  defendant's house.</p>
<p>It is true that one of the witnesses for the prosecution stated that one of the men referred to, called Simeon, was Cosine Caro, the  defendant  himself  having told  him so, and there is evidence to the effect that Cosme Caro was the chief of a band  of brigands.  But the testimony of this witness was contradicted by that of the accused, who stated that the said  Cosme  Caro had never  been in his house.  Aside from this there is no other evidence tending to show that the men referred to by the witnesses for the prosecution were  members of the band of brigands  of Cosme  Caro.</p>
<p>In view of the evidence introduced at the trial the court below found that the crime of brigandage with which the defendant was charged in the complaint had not been satisfactorily established,  but that during the months of June and July there had been in  the vicinity of the barrio of Cabcaben, of which the defendant was the councilor, several members  of a band of brigands and that he had failed to report their  presence to the provincial governor or  the Constabulary inspector, in violation  of section 5 of Act No. 781, and sentenced the said defendant to one year's imprisonment and to pay a fine  of  200 dollars, United States currency, with the costs of  the proceedings.</p>
<p>Without deciding whether  the crime provided and punished in section 5  of  Act No. 781 is  necessarily included in the crime of brigandage, and whether the accused can, therefore, be convicted for the former crime, under a complaint for the latter, the fact is that there is not sufficient evidence in the  case  to convict the defendant under the aforesaid provision of law.  The reasons above  stated why we are precluded from finding that the crime of brigandage has been  committed,  may also be advanced for the conclusion  that the provisions of Act No. 781 have not been violated.  If credit were to be given  to the witnesses for the prosecution we would have to conclude that the crime of brigandage had  been committed, otherwise there would be no evidence that any band  of brigands had ever been in the vicinity of the  barrio of Cabcaben, and much less that the defendant had knowledge of its presence.  In any event it has not been satisfactorily proved that the men referred to by the witnesses for the prosecution were really brigands.</p>
<p>We accordingly reverse the judgment appealed from and acquit the defendant, with the  costs of both instances  <em>de oficio</em>.   After the expiration of ten days let judgment  be entered in accordance herewith, and ten days  thereafter the  case be remanded to the Court of First Instance for execution.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres,  Carson, Willard, </em>and  <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
