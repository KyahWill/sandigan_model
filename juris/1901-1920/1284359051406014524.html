				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">A written charge of unchastity or immorality brought against a married woman 
is libelous per se. As Justice Mapa well said in a somewhat similar case (U. S. 
<em>vs</em>. Escobanas [1908], 12 Phil., 80) "for the purpose of humiliating and 
insulting a woman, nothing more base or more vile can be conceived." And this is 
practically the fact in the present case. The accused signed and knowingly sent 
a letter to one Pilar Trespeces, a married woman, in which she charged Pilar 
Trespeces with having illicit relations with her, the accused's, husband. The 
letter was "published" as the word is used in the law. All this is admitted. 
Justifiable motives for defendants's action were not shown. The accused set up 
the excuse of sickness on account of pregnancy. Undoubtedly, unreasoning 
jealousy was the prime motive.
<p>The two formal assignments of error by appellant's counsel, going to the 
merits of the case, are therefore refuted. The other assignment of error is that 
the trial judge did not have the complaint read to the accused. A glance at the 
record will show that this assignment is ill-advised for it there appears that 
"the defendant waived the reading of the complaint and pleaded not guilty."</p>
<p>The lower court imposed a penalty of two months imprisonment and a fine of 
P250 with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and the costs. The 
Attorney-General suggests that in view of the poor health of the accused and the 
fact that the libel was not given much publicity, the penalty imposed is too 
severe. With this we agree and believe that the ends of justice will be met by 
the imposition of a fine. Accordingly, the judgment of the lower court is 
modified by substituting a fine of P250, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of 
insolvency, with the costs of both instances. So ordered.</p><em>Arellano, C. 
J., Johnson, Araullo</em>, and <em>Street, JJ.</em>, concur. <br><br><br>
<hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1">

<p>CARSON, J., concurring:</p>
<p>I concur in the judgment of conviction, but the reasons assigned in the 
principal opinion for reducing the penalty to a fine of P250, with subsidiary 
imprisonment in case of nonpayment, would seem to me to justify and require the 
imposition of a substantially nominal penalty, which I would fix at about P5 or 
P10, or not to exceed P25. It is not improbable that the accused will be unable 
to pay the fine, and will be compelled to suffer subsidiary imprisonment of 
several months. I would hesitate to impose such a penalty upon a woman who, 
during the period of her pregnancy seems to have been moved by unreasoning 
jealousy of her husband to turn upon the woman against whom her unreasoning 
suspicions are aroused, with words of abuse, either oral or in writing in a 
letter addressed to the suspected woman herself.</p></div>
