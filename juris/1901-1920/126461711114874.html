				<H3>GABRIELA ALINO ET AL., PETITIONERS, VS. HON. IGNAOIO VILLAMOR, JUDGE OF FIRST INSTANCE OF CAVITE, RESPONDENT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>LADD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This  a petition  for a mandamus  to a judge  of  First Instance, requiring him to certify a bill of exceptions containing, among other things, the argument of counsel for the opposite party at the trial of the  main action, and the evidence taken at the trial.  It appears from the petition that the only exception taken was to the judgment.</p>
<p>(1)  The judge  very properly  refused to embody  the argument of counsel in the hill of exceptions.   The object of a bill of exceptions is simply to present in an intelligible form  the facts necessary to enable the appellate court to review the rulings, orders, or judgments excepted to, and to this  purpose, what was said by counsel at the trial by way of argument is  obviously wholly  foreign and  irrelevant,   (Gonzaga vs. Norris, decided December 3,1902.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>)</p>
<p>(2) If an exception to a judgment is based on the ground that there is no evidence whatever to support the findings of fact  made by the court, the evidence necessarily forms a part of the bill of exceptions.   (Prautch, Scholes &amp;  Co. vs. Dolores Hernandez, decided February 10, 1902.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>)   But if  no such claim is made, the evidence  is not properly included in the bill of  exceptions.  (Thunga  Chui vs.  Que Bentec, decided September 5,  1902.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>)   There is nothing in this petition from which we can infer that it is claimed that there is no evidence to support the judgment, and it does not appear, therefore, on the petitioner's own showing, that the judge ought to have included the evidence in the bill of exceptions.</p>
<p>For these reasons the petition is denied.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Cooper, Willard, </em>and <em>Mapa, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em> Torres, J.,</em> did not vote.</p>
<em>McDonough, J.,</em> did not sit in this case.<br>
