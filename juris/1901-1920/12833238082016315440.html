				<H3>JOSE DEOGRACIAS, PETITIONER, VS. JOSE C. ABREU, JUDGE OF FIRST INSTANCE OF THE FOURTEENTH JUDICIAL DISTRICT, AND GUMERSINDO DE LA SANTA, RESPONDENTS.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>MORELAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>This is an original action in this court to obtain a writ of mandamus 
directed to the Court of First Instance of the 14th Judicial District to compel 
it to proceed with the hearing of an election contest which it had dismissed on 
motion.</p>
<p>At the elections held on the 6th of June, 1916, in the municipality of Boac, 
subprovince of Marinduque, Province of Tayabas, there were five candidates for 
the office of municipal president, Jose Deogracias, Gumersindo de la Santa, 
Benito Mondoñedo, Pedro Mascarenas and Narciso Alino. Gumersindo de la Santa 
having, according to the return of the inspectors, received the highest 
number,of votes cast was proclaimed elected by the municipal board of canvassers 
on the 9th of June, 1916.</p>
<p>On the 19th of June the plaintiff filed a protest against the election of the 
said De la Santa. The contest was amended on the 2nd of August. Gumersindo de la 
Santa duly answered the amended protest on the 18th of August.</p>
<p>On the 5th of September Gumersindo de la Santa filed a motion in the Court of 
First Instance in which the contest was pending for the dismissal of the contest 
on the ground that not all of the persons receiving votes for the office 
contested had been notified of the contest in the manner and within the time 
prescribed by law. After a hearing the motion was granted and the contest was 
dismissed upon the grounds stated in the motion.</p>
<p>The court in its order dismissing the contest said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Notwithstanding the fact that it does not appear in the record in this case 
that the notices were served, the court has permitted the contestant to offer 
evidence on that subject. In accepting this opportunity the contestant offered 
in evidence a copy of the contest on which appear acknowledgments or admissions 
of service of the notice of protest by Benito Mondonedo, Narciso Aliño and Pedro 
Mascareñas; but the only evidence offered by the protestant to show service of 
notice on the respondent Gumersindo dela Santa was the receipt which one 
receiving registered mail signs on receipt of the same.</p>
<p>"This receipt is not sufficient to prove the service of the notice of the 
contest on Gumersindo de la Santa, In the absence of a special provision on the 
subject, since the Election Law does not provide the manner in which the notice 
of contest should be served on the candidates receiving votes, the notice must 
be served on the candidates in the manner required by the rules promulgated for 
the Courts of First Instance of the Islands.</p>
<p>"Article 14 of those rules provides: 'Notices and copies of motions and 
pleadings may be served by anyone. Proof of such service may be made by the 
written admission of the party served or the affidavit of the party serving. In 
each case the time, place, and manner of the service shall be stated. In all 
cases the proof shall be filed with the clerk.'</p>
<p>"As will be seen neither the registered receipt nor the acknowledgment of 
Mondoñedo, Aliño and Mascareñas are sufficient to prove service under the 
provisions of the rules just referred to inasmuch as, with regard to the 
registered receipt, there is no sworn statement of the person- who served the 
notice nor an acknowledgment or admission of the service by the person to whom 
the notice was directed; and with regard to the admissions of service by the 
others it does not appear on what date or in what place or in what manner the 
notice was served. With respect to the service on all of them the proof of 
service has not been duly filed in the office of the clerk of 
court."</p></blockquote>
<p>Upon the grounds thus stated the court dismissed the contest.</p>
<p>We are of the opinion that the court was in error in part and correct in 
part. A written admission of service by a party to an action or proceeding is as 
effective as an affidavit of service made by the persons who actually served the 
process or notice. As appears from the statement of the court admission of 
service was made by three of the four respondents. That admission of service was 
in writing and attached to a copy of the contest. This is sufficient to prove 
service as to them. As to the other respondent Gumersindo de la Santa it is 
sufficient to recall that he appeared in the case and filed an answer. It is the 
universal rule that a voluntary general appearance, and especially the filing of 
a pleading, is an act which gives the court complete jurisdiction over the 
person of the party so appearing and pleading and that no service of process or 
of notice on him is necessary thereafter.</p>
<p>It appears, however, that the appearance in the case and the filing of the 
answer did not occur until the 18th of August, 1916, whereas the contest was 
filed on the 19th of June. Therefore, under the recent decision of this court in 
the case of Bermudez vs. Court of First Instance of Tayabas, (p. 360, ante), 
notice of the contest must be served on the respondents within twenty days after 
the filing of the contest. It is clear that the appearance and answer of the 
respondent Gumersindo de la Santa was long after the expiration of the twenty 
days referred to; and the question therefore arises as to whether the rule of 
twenty days applies to a voluntary general appearance and to an appearance by 
answer as it does to service. In principle there should be no distinction. If it 
is essential to confer jurisdiction on the court that the notice of contest be 
served within twenty days after the contest is filed, then, certainly, there was 
no jurisdiction here as there was no service or appearance within that time. The 
jurisdiction of the court failed at the end of the twentieth day and a voluntary 
general appearance thereafter was without force or effect.</p>
<p>The other evidence of the service of the notice on the respondent Gumersindo 
de la Santa offered by the contestant was the receipt acknowledging delivery of 
register package to which the court refers in its opinion. We are satisfied that 
this receipt is not sufficient evidence of service to comply with the provisions 
of the Code of Civil Procedure with respect to the service of a summons in an 
action, which provisions we have held applicable to the service of notice of 
contest in cases of this character (Campos <em>vs</em>. Wislizenus and Aldanese, 
35 Phil. Rep., 373.)</p>
<p>There being no proof of service of the contest on Gumersindo de la Santa 
within the twenty days after the filing of the contest, and his appearance and 
answer occurring after that period had expired, the court acquired no 
jurisdiction of the proceeding and the contest was properly dismissed.</p>
<p>The demurrer is sustained; and unless an amended complaint is filed within 
five days the action will be dismissed with costs. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Carson, Trent</em>, and <em>Araullo, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
