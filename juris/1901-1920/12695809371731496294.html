				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This was an action for criminal libel.
<p>The complaint alleged:</p>
<p>"That on the 25th day of September, 1913, the said Carson Taylor, being then 
and there the acting editor and proprietor, manager, printer, and publisher in 
the city of Manila, Philippine Islands, of a certain daily bilingual newspaper, 
edited in the English and Spanish languages, and known as the 'Manila Daily 
Bulletin,' a paper of large circulation throughout the Philippine Islands, as 
well as in the United States and other countries in all of which both languages 
are spoken and written, and having as such the supervision and control of said 
newspaper, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, feloniously, maliciously, 
and with intent to impeach the honesty, virtue, and reputation of one Ramon 
Sotelo as member of the bar of the Philippine Islands and as a private 
individual, and to expose him to public hatred, contempt and ridicule, compose, 
print, edit, publish, and circulate and procure to be composed, printed, edited, 
published, and circulated in said newspaper's issue of the above mentioned date, 
September 25, 1913, a certain false and malicious defamation and libel in the 
English language of and concerning the said Ramon Sotelo, which reads as 
follows:</p>
<p align="center">" 'OWNERS FIRED BUILDING TO COLLECT INSURANCE.—<br>CRIMINAL 
CHARGES FOLLOW CIVIL SUIT.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>" 'Conspiracy divulged in three sworn statements made by members of the party 
after a family disagreement. Sensational statement sworn to. Mystery of Calle 
O'Donnell fire solved and papers served.</p>
<p>" 'Conspiracy to defraud the insurance company.</p>
<p>" 'The building was fired to collect the amount of insurance.</p>
<p>" 'The movable furniture of value was removed before the fire.</p>
<p>" 'The full amount of the insurance was collected, and the conspiracy was a 
success.</p>
<p>" 'The above is the gist of the sworn statements of Vicente Sotelo and 
Eugenio Martin in connection with the fire that destroyed house No. 2157 Calle 
O'Donnell on April 4.</p>
<p>" 'The case in question is a sensational one to say the least, and the court 
is being petitioned to set aside the ruling and cite the parties to show cause 
why they should not be cited to answer charges of conspiracy to defraud.</p>
<p>" 'On April 4,1913, the house located at 2157 Calle O'Donnell was destroyed 
by fire. The house was insured for P5,000, the contents for an additional 
P5,000, with the West of Scotland Insurance Association, of which Lutz &amp; Co. 
are the local agents, with an additional P1,500 with Smith, Bell &amp; Co.</p>
<p>"'The full amount of the insurance on the property was paid by the agents of 
the insurance companies and the matter apparently dropped from the records.</p>
<p>" 'Then there was internal trouble and information began to leak out which 
resulted in sensational statements to the effect that the destruction of the 
property had been an act of incendiarism in order to collect the insurance. Then 
there was an investigation started and it resulted in sworn statements of the 
three persons above mentioned.</p>
<p>" 'Notarial returns were made yesterday by the sheriff, based on the sworn 
statements and the parties are cited to appear in court and show cause.</p>
<p>" "The investigation also showed that the furniture, which was supposed to be 
in the house at the time of the conflagration and which was paid for by the 
insurance agents, sworn statements having been made that it was destroyed in the 
fire, was in a certain house in Montalban, where it was identified upon the 
sworn statements of the above mentioned. Implicated in the charges of conspiracy 
and fraud is the name of tne attorney for the plaintiff who made affidavit as to 
the burning of the house and against whom criminal proceedings will be brought 
as well as against the original owners.</p>
<p>" 'Attorney Burke, who represents Lutz &amp; Co. in the proceedings, was seen 
last night and asked for a statement as to the case. Mr. Burke refused to talk 
on the case and stated that when it came to trial it would be time enough to 
obtain the facts.</p>
<p>" 'The present action came before the court on a motion of Attorney Burke to 
set aside the judgment, which, in the original case, gave the owners of the 
property judgment for the amount of the insurance.</p>
<p>"'Attorney Burke filed the sworn statements with the court and the notarial 
returns to the same were made yesterday afternoon, the sworn statements as to 
the burning of the house being in the hands of the sheriff.</p>
<p>"'It was stated yesterday that a criminal action would follow the civil 
proceedings instituted to recover the funds in the case entitled on the court 
records, Maria Mortera de Eceiza and Manuel Eceiza versus the West of Scotland 
Association, Limited, No. 10191 on the court records.</p>
<p>" 'It might be stated also that Eugenio Martin was one of the plaintiffs in 
the recent suit brought against Ex-Governor W. Cameron Forbes for lumber 
supplied for his Boston home.'</p>
<p>"That in this article is contained the following paragraph. to wit:</p>
<p>" ' * * *. Implicated in the charges of conspiracy and fraud is the name of 
the attorney for the plaintiff who made affidavit as to the burning of the house 
and against whom criminal proceedings will be brought as well as against the 
original owners,' by which the said accused meant to refer and did refer to the 
said Ramon Sotelo, who then and there was the attorney for the plaintiff in the 
case aforesaid, No. 10191 of the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, 
and so was understood by the public who read the same; that the statements and 
allegations made in said paragraph are wholly false and untrue, thus impeaching 
the honesty, virtue, and reputation of the said offended party as a member of 
the bar of the Philippine Islands and as a private individual, and exposing him 
to public hatred, contempt and ridicule. Contrary to law."</p></blockquote>
<p>Upon said complaint the defendant was arrested, arraigned, plead not guilty, 
was tried, found guilty of the crime charged, and sentenced by the Honorable 
George N. Hurd, judge, to pay a fine of P200. From that sentence the defendant 
appealed to this court and made the following assignments of error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"First. The court erred in finding that the defendant was responsible for and 
guilty of the alleged libel.</p>
<p>"Second. The court erred in finding that the defendant was the proprietor and 
publisher of the 'Manila Daily Bulletin.</p>
<p>"Third. The court erred in finding that the alleged Jibelous article was 
libelous per se.</p>
<p>"Fourth. The court erred in holding that the article was libelous, while 
finding that there was no malice. </p>
<p>"Fifth. The court erred in finding that the alleged libel, ous article 
referred to attorney Ramon Sotelo.</p>
<p>"Sixth. The court erred in finding that Ramon Sotelo was attorney for the 
plaintiffs in case No. 10191, when the alleged libel was 
published."</p></blockquote>
<p>After a careful examination of the record and the arguments presented by the 
appellant, we deem it necessary to discuss only the first and second assignments 
of error.</p>
<p>In the Philippine Islands there exist no crimes such as are known in the 
United States and England as common law crimes. No act constitutes a crime here 
unless it is made so by law. Libel is made a crime here by Act No. 277 of the 
United States Philippine Commission. Said Act<br>(No. 277) not only defines the 
crime of libel and prescribes the particular conditions necessary to constitute 
it, but it also names the persons who may be guilty of such crime. In the 
present case the complaint alleges that the defendant was, at the time of the 
publication of said alleged article "the acting editor, proprietor, manager, 
printer, publisher, etc. etc. of a certain bilingual, newspaper, etc., known as 
the 'Manila Daily Bulletin, a paper of large circulation throughout the 
Philippine Islands, as well as in the United States and other countries."</p>
<p>It will be noted that the complaint charges the defendant as "the acting 
editor, proprietor, manager, printer, and publisher." From an examination of 
said Act No. 277, we find that section 6 provides that: "Every author, editor, 
or proprietor of any book, newspaper, or serial publication is chargeable with 
the.publication of any words contained in any part of said book or number of 
each newspaper or serial as fully as if he were the author of the same."</p>
<p>By an examination of said article, with reference to the persons who may be 
liable for the publication of a libel in a newspaper, we find that it only 
provides for the punishment of "the author, editor, or proprietor." It would 
follow, therefore, that unless the proof shows that the defendant in the present 
case is the "author, editor, or proprietor" of the newspaper in which the libel 
was published, he can not be held liable.</p>
<p>In the present case the Solicitor-General in his brief said that—"No person 
is represented to be either the 'author, editor, or proprietor.'" That statement 
of the Solicitor-General is fully sustained by the record. There is not a word 
of proof in the record showing: that the defendant was either the "atithor, the 
editor, or the proprietor." The proof shows that the defendant was the 
"manager." He must, therefore, be acquitted of the crime charged against him, 
unless it is shown by the proof that he, as "manager" of the newspaper, was in 
some way directly responsible for the writing, editing, or publishing of the 
matter contained in said alleged libelous article. The prosecution presented the 
newspaper, the "Manila Daily Bulletin," for the purpose of showing the relation 
which the defendant had to it. That was the only proof presented by the 
prosecution to show the relation which the defendant had to the publication of 
the libel in question. From an examination of the editorial page of said 
exhibit, we find that it shows that the "Manila Daily Bulletin" is owned by the 
"Bulletin Publishing Company," and that the defendant was its manager. There is 
not a word of proof in the record which shows what relation the manager had to 
the publication of said newspaper. We might, by a series of presumptions and 
assumptions, conclude that the manager of a newspaper has some direct 
responsibility with its publication; We believe, however, that such presumptions 
and assumptions, in the absence of a single letter of proof relating thereto, 
would be unwarranted and unjustified. The prosecuting attorney had an 
opportunity to present proof upon that question. Either because he had no proof 
or because no such proof was obtainable, he presented none. It certainly is not 
a difficult matter to ascertain who is the real person responsible for the 
publication of a newspaper which is published daily and has a wide circulation 
in a particular community. No question was asked the defendant concerning his 
particular relation to the publication of the newspaper in question. We do not 
desire to be understood in our conclusions here as holding that the "manager" or 
the "printer" may not, under certain conditions and proper proof, be held to be 
the "author, editor, or proprietor" of a newspaper. He may denominate himself as 
"manager' or "printer" simply, and be at the same time the "author, editor; or 
proprietor" of the newspaper. He can not avoid responsibility by using some 
other term or” word, indicating his relation to the newspaper or the 
publication, when, as a matter of fact, he is the "author, the editor, or the 
proprietor" of the same. His real relation to the said publication is a matter 
of proof. The Solicitor-General, in his brief, says that the defendant used the 
word "manager" with the hope of evading legal responsibility, as the Libel Law 
places the responsibility for publishing a libel, on "every author, editor, or 
proprietor of any book, etc." Had the prosecuting attorney in the trial of the 
cause believed that the defendant, even though he called himself the "manager" 
was, in fact, the "author, editor, or proprietor" of said publication, he should 
have presented some proof supporting that contention. Neither do we desire to be 
understood as holding that simply because a person connected with the 
publication of a newspaper who calls himself the "manager" or "printer" may not, 
in fact and at the same time, be the "author, editor, or proprietor." The 
"author, editor, or proprietor" can not avoid responsibility for the writing and 
publication of a libelous article, by simply calling himself the "manager" or 
the "printer" of a newspaper. That, however, is a question of proof. The burden 
is upon the prosecution to show that the defendant is, by whatever name he may 
call himself, in truth and in fact, the "author, editor, or proprietor" of a 
newspaper. The courts cannot assume, in the absence of proof, that one who 
called himself "manager" was in fact the "author, editor, or proprietor." We 
might assume, perhaps, that the "manager" of a newspaper plays an important part 
in the publication of the same by virtue of the general signification of the 
word "manager," Men can not, however, be sentenced upon the basis of a mere 
assumption. There must be some proof. The word "manage" has been defined by 
Webster to mean "to have under control and direction; to conduct; to guide; to 
administer; to treat; to handle." Webster defines "manager" to be "one who 
manages; a conductor or director; as, the manager of a theater." A manager, as 
that word is generally understood, we do not believe includes the idea of 
ownership. Generally speaking it means one who is representing another as an 
agent. That being true, his powers and duties and obligations are generally 
defined by contract. He may have expressed as well as implied powers, but 
whatever his powers and duties are they must be dependent upon the nature of the 
business and the terms of his contract. There is no fixed rule which indicates 
particularly and definitely his duties, powers and obligations. An examination 
into the character of the business and the contract of his employment must be 
made for the purpose of ascertaining definitely wliat his duties and obligations 
are. His exact relation is always a matter of proof. It is incumbent upon the 
prosecution in a case like the present, to show that whatever title, name or 
designation the defendant may bear, he was, in fact, the "author, the editor, or 
the proprietor" of the newspaper. If he was in fact the "author, editor, or 
proprietor," he can not escape responsibility by calling himself the "manager" 
or "printer." It is the relation which he bears to the publication and not the 
name or title which he has assumed, which is important in an investigation. He 
can not wear the toga of author or editor and hide his responsibility by giving 
himself some other name. While the terms "author, editor, and proprietor" of a 
newspaper are terms well defined, the particular words "author, editor, or 
proprietor" are not material or important, further thati that they are words 
which are intended to show the relation of the responsible party to the 
publication. That relation may as well exist under some other name or 
denomination.</p>
<p>For the foregoing reasons, therefore, there being no proof whatever in the 
record showing that the defendant was the "author, the editor, or the 
proprietor" of the newspaper in question, the sentence of the lower court must 
be reversed, the complaint dismissed and the defendant discharged from the 
custody of the law, with costs de officio. So ordered.</p>
