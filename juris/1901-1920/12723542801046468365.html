				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> On the 26th of February, 1914, a complaint was presented in the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; the city of&nbsp; Manila, charging the defendant with being a laborer in the Philippine Islands without the laborer's certificate&nbsp; provided for by section 4 of Act No. 702.<br><br>Upon the complaint the&nbsp; defendant was duly arrested and brought before the court for trial.&nbsp; After hearing&nbsp; the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause, the Honorable A. S. Crossfield, judge, found as a fact that the defendant came to the&nbsp; Philippine Islands in 1899;&nbsp; that he was a laborer until about 1912 or 1913,&nbsp; when he became a merchant.&nbsp;&nbsp; Under these facts&nbsp; the lower court made the following observations:&nbsp; "While the respondent would have been subject to deportation because of failure to obtain&nbsp; his certificate&nbsp; at any time before his becoming a&nbsp; merchant, I am of the opinion that, having been allowed to remain in the Islands for a long period of time without the certificate and that having become a merchant, he is relieved from the necessity of having such certificate as a laborer; and being legally&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Philippine Islands&nbsp; and having become a member of one of the exempt classes, he is not subject to deportation."<br><br>With that&nbsp; conclusion the lower court ordered&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant discharged from custody, with costs <i>de officio</i>. From that judgment&nbsp; the plaintiff appealed to&nbsp; this court.<br><br>From an examination of the record, the following facts appear to be proven and not denied:<br><br>First. That the&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; is a Chinaman;&nbsp; that he was born&nbsp; in Fu&nbsp; Kien; that he&nbsp; is a&nbsp; subject&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Chinese Republic;&nbsp; that he&nbsp; came to the Philippine&nbsp; Islands in 1899 from&nbsp; China.<br><br>Second.&nbsp; That he was a&nbsp; laborer until&nbsp; the year 1912 or 1913.<br><br>Third. That he&nbsp; was&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; city of Manila during the years 1903 and 1904; in fact, he&nbsp; continued&nbsp; to&nbsp; reside in Manila, from&nbsp; the time of his arrival, up to and&nbsp; including the time of the commencement of the present proceeding.<br><br>Fourth.&nbsp; That during the years&nbsp; 1902, 1903, and 1904, he was a laborer; that he learned in the year&nbsp; 1905&nbsp; that&nbsp; it was necessary for him to secure&nbsp; a certificate; that he did not secure the certificate, for the reason that he was informed that the time within&nbsp; which he could secure&nbsp; it had closed.<br><br>Fifth. That during all the time that he&nbsp; has been in the Philippine Islands he never obtained a personal cedula.<br><br>From the&nbsp; foregoing&nbsp; facts it clearly&nbsp; appears&nbsp; that the defendant was in the Philippine Islands as a laborer during the period within which he was required to register under Act No.&nbsp; 702&nbsp; and&nbsp; that&nbsp; he failed&nbsp; to register during&nbsp; that period, or during&nbsp; any other&nbsp; period.&nbsp; We have decided in numerous&nbsp; cases that the necessity of&nbsp; registration&nbsp; under Act No. 702 depended upon the status of the Chinese alien during the time within which Chinese laborers are required to register under&nbsp; Act No. 702.&nbsp; If they&nbsp; are&nbsp; required to register during that period, and fail, their status thereafter could not&nbsp; relieve them from&nbsp; the necessity&nbsp; of&nbsp; having a laborer's certificate.&nbsp;&nbsp; (U. S.&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Sia Lam Han, 29 Phil. Rep., 159; U. S. <i>vs.</i> Yu Wa, 28 Phil. Rep., 1; U. S. <i>vs.</i> Tan Chuy Ho, p. 383 <i>ante</i>.)<br><br>The enforcement&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; foregoing rule may work&nbsp; a hardship.&nbsp;&nbsp; The courts,&nbsp; however, are&nbsp; not&nbsp; responsible for statutory&nbsp; law.&nbsp; It is the duty of&nbsp; the courts to enforce the law as they find it.<br><br>In&nbsp; view of all of the foregoing, we are of&nbsp; the opinion that the judgment of the lower court must be revoked, and the defendant deported&nbsp; from the Philippine Islands, and without any finding as to costs, it is&nbsp; so ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Carson,</i> and Araullo, JJ., concur.<br></div>
