				<BR><STRONG>TRENT, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The appellee, Cayetano de la Cruz, was a member and the president of a Methodist Episcopal religious association at&nbsp; Dinalupijan,&nbsp; Province of Bataan,&nbsp; Philippine&nbsp; Islands. The members&nbsp; of this&nbsp; association,&nbsp; including Cayetano&nbsp; de la Cruz, having decided to lease a building site and erect thereon&nbsp; a chapel,&nbsp; made&nbsp; voluntary contributions for that&nbsp; purpose,&nbsp; Cayetano&nbsp; de&nbsp; la Cruz&nbsp; being among&nbsp; those who contributed.&nbsp; Cayetano de&nbsp; la Cruz, as such&nbsp; member and president, was then authorized by the association&nbsp; to lease a&nbsp; certain building site and&nbsp; to use the funds contributed for the purpose of constructing a chapel.&nbsp;&nbsp; So on the&nbsp; 17th of May, 1907,&nbsp; he leased from one J.&nbsp; C. Miller,&nbsp; the agent of the appellant, His Grace Jeremiah J. Harty, Archbishop of Manila and&nbsp; administrator&nbsp; of the&nbsp; hacienda of&nbsp; Dinalupijan, for a period of two years, a certain lot or parcel of land, being a part of that hacienda and which is fully described in the&nbsp; written&nbsp; contract oi lease, agreeing to pay as rental P2 per&nbsp; year,&nbsp; the first year's rent to be&nbsp; paid in advance.&nbsp; On the execution&nbsp; of this lease Cayetano de la Cruz, as member and president of the Methodist&nbsp; Episcopal association,&nbsp; was placed in possession&nbsp; of this lot or building site and proceeded to construct thereon a chapel for the use of the&nbsp; said&nbsp; religious association.&nbsp; About the time this&nbsp; chapel was completed an action of forcible entry and detainer was commenced&nbsp; by&nbsp; one Raymundo&nbsp; Sinsuangco in the justice of&nbsp; the peace court of&nbsp; Dinalupijan,&nbsp; in which Cayetano de&nbsp; la&nbsp; Cruz, as&nbsp; lessee of&nbsp; the&nbsp; lot&nbsp; upon which the chapel was&nbsp; constructed,&nbsp; and J. C. Miller,&nbsp; as agent&nbsp; and representative&nbsp; of the appellants,&nbsp; who, in&nbsp; such capacity executed said lease, as lessor, were made defendants.&nbsp; Judgment was rendered&nbsp; against the defendants in that action. The&nbsp; appellants in the case at bar were duly notified of the judgment of the justice of the peace and were&nbsp; requested to appeal to&nbsp; the Court of First Instance.&nbsp; No appeal&nbsp; Was taken&nbsp; and the&nbsp; judgment becoming final&nbsp; was executed&nbsp; in such a manner that the&nbsp; above-mentioned chapel&nbsp; was completely destroyed.&nbsp; Subsequently thereto, and on the&nbsp; 21st of October, 1907, Cayetano&nbsp; de la&nbsp; Cruz commenced&nbsp; this action in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila against the appellants to recover&nbsp; the sum&nbsp; of 2,000&nbsp; as damages for a breach&nbsp; of the rental contract.&nbsp;&nbsp; To&nbsp; this complaint the appellants, through their attorneys,&nbsp; presented a demurrer, based upon&nbsp; the&nbsp; following grounds:&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; That the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of the city&nbsp; of Manila&nbsp; was without jurisdiction to try and determine this action for the reason that damages for injuries caused to real property situated&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Province of&nbsp; Bataan is sought to be recovered; and (2) the complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause&nbsp; of action.&nbsp;&nbsp; This demurrer was overruled,&nbsp; the appellants duly noting their exception.<br><br>After all the evidence had&nbsp; been submitted by both parties, the appellee, after&nbsp; due&nbsp; notice to the appellants, presented an amended complaint,&nbsp; to conform, as he alleged,&nbsp; with the agreed statement of facts and the admissions&nbsp; made by the appellants&nbsp; in their&nbsp; answer.&nbsp;&nbsp; This amended&nbsp; complaint was admitted by the court without objection on the part of the appellants.&nbsp; The&nbsp; amended complaint is the same as the original complaint,&nbsp; with the following exceptions: (1) A number of unnamed&nbsp; person were made parties&nbsp; plaintiff; (2) in paragraph 2 of the amended&nbsp; complaint it is alleged that Cayetano de la&nbsp; Cruz was the&nbsp; president, agent,&nbsp; and member of the Methodist Episcopal religious association; and (3) a&nbsp; judgment for only P402 was asked.<br><br>The court below&nbsp; on the 29th of March, 1909,&nbsp; rendered judgment&nbsp; in favor of the appellees and against the appellants for the sum of&nbsp; P402, P2 being the&nbsp; rent for the first year paid in advance, and the P400 being the agreed value&nbsp; of the chapel which was destroyed by the sheriff in executing&nbsp; the judgment rendered&nbsp; by&nbsp; the justice of the peace.<br><br>The appellants after noting their exception to this judgment&nbsp; and making a motion&nbsp; for a new trial, which motion was&nbsp; overruled&nbsp; and exception thereto noted,&nbsp; appealed to this court,&nbsp; and now insist:<br><ol type="1"><li>That&nbsp; as this action is one for damages to real estate situated in the Province of Bataan, under the provisions of section 377 of&nbsp; the Code of Civil Procedure the Court of First Instance of&nbsp; the city of&nbsp; Manila had no jurisdiction;<br><br></li><li>The court below&nbsp; erred in admitting the amended&nbsp; complaint by which the&nbsp; other members of the religious association, jointly&nbsp; interested&nbsp; with&nbsp; Cayetano de la Cruz,&nbsp; were made&nbsp; parties plaintiff; and,<br><br></li><li>That&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellants are not&nbsp; liable for&nbsp; the consequences of&nbsp; the judgment of the justice of the peace.</li></ol>The demurrer was properly overruled.&nbsp; This is not an action to recover damages to real estate; it is an action for breach of covenant in a lease.&nbsp; The fact that the damages to real estate are involved, as an incident to the breach of the contract,&nbsp; does not change the character of the action. Such an&nbsp; action is personal and transitory.&nbsp; The rule is well stated in the case of Neill <i>vs</i>. Owen (3 Tex., 145), wherein the court said (p. 146):<br><blockquote>"If the action is founded on privity of contract between the parties, then the action whether&nbsp; debt&nbsp; or covenant, is transitory.&nbsp; But if there is no privity of contract and the action is founded on privity of estate only, such a covenant that runs with the land in the hands of the remote grantees, then the action is local and must be brought in the county wherein&nbsp; the land lies.<br><br>"In an action on a covenant contained in a lease, whether begun by the lessor against the lessee, or by&nbsp; the&nbsp; lessee against the lessor, the action is transitory&nbsp; because&nbsp; it is founded&nbsp; on a mere privity of contract.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Thursby <i>vs.</i> Plant, cited&nbsp; in vol. 5, Ency. Plead. &amp; Prac, p. 362.)<br><br>"In genera], also, actions&nbsp; which&nbsp; are founded&nbsp; upon contracts are transitory.&nbsp; In&nbsp; an&nbsp; action upon a lease for non-payment of rent or other breach of&nbsp; covenants, when the action is founded on the&nbsp; privity of contract it is&nbsp; transitory and the venue may be laid in any county.&nbsp; (22 Ency. Plead. &amp;&nbsp; Prac,&nbsp; pp. 782-783.)"</blockquote>Therefore,&nbsp; section&nbsp; 377 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which provides, among other things, that actions&nbsp; to recover damages for&nbsp; injuries to real estate&nbsp; shall&nbsp; be brought in the province where the land, or a part thereof, is situated, is&nbsp; not applicable.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Molina <i>vs.</i> De la Riva,&nbsp; 6 Phil. Rep., 12.)&nbsp;&nbsp; The amended complaint clearly&nbsp; states facts sufficient to constitute&nbsp; a cause&nbsp; of&nbsp; action.&nbsp; (Sec. 90, Code of&nbsp; Civil Procedure.)<br><br>The defendants in the second assignment of error assert that the&nbsp; plaintiff ought not to have been allowed to amend his complaint so&nbsp; as to make him the&nbsp; representative of all the persons interested in the subject matter of this action. We are of the opinion&nbsp; that such amendment was properly allowed.&nbsp; Section 110&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Code&nbsp; of&nbsp; Civil Procedure is exceedingly broad in its terms and there is no disposition in this court to narrow its terms or meaning.&nbsp; We are also of the opinion that this is&nbsp; particularly&nbsp; the&nbsp; class of action to which section&nbsp; 118 of the Code of Civil Procedure refers. It would be exceedingly difficult and expensive&nbsp; to require that all persons&nbsp; interested&nbsp; be made parties plaintiff.&nbsp; To avoid this was the&nbsp; very&nbsp; purpose in enacting section 118. The plaintiff,&nbsp; as appears&nbsp; from&nbsp; the&nbsp; record, is the person chosen by&nbsp; the members of the association&nbsp; in question&nbsp; to look after and represent their interest and it is correspondingly appropriate that he should represent and act for them in this action. In permitting this the court is not thwarting their will or endangering&nbsp; their interest, but, rather, is carrying out their desires&nbsp; and purposes as&nbsp; they have already expressed them.<br><br>In the third assignment&nbsp; of error&nbsp; it is&nbsp; insisted that the appellants&nbsp; are not liable for the consequences of the&nbsp; judgment of the justice of&nbsp; the peace, for&nbsp; the&nbsp; reason&nbsp; that according to that judgment the plaintiff, in violation of the rights of Raymundo Sinsuangco, entered upon&nbsp; the lot&nbsp; in question.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; is argued that the plaintiff should not have entered into possession&nbsp; of this lot in&nbsp; violation of the rights of Sinsuangco, but that he should have acquired&nbsp; possession by due judicial process, and that having entered into possession in this manner&nbsp; he must suffer the consequences&nbsp; of his illegal&nbsp; acts.&nbsp; In this we can&nbsp; not&nbsp; agree.&nbsp; When this rental contract was executed the lot in question was vacant. The agent, Miller, led the plaintiff to believe that he&nbsp; could place him in legal possession of the lot.&nbsp; It was&nbsp; upon this theory that&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff entered&nbsp; into&nbsp; this contract and paid the rent for the first year.&nbsp; The record does not&nbsp; affirmatively show&nbsp; that Miller placed&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff in possession of this lot, but in the absence of proof to the contrary we&nbsp; think it&nbsp; fair to presume&nbsp; that&nbsp; this occurred. Miller then placed the plaintiff in possession of this lot,&nbsp; but not&nbsp; in the legal possession of same.&nbsp; He himself did not have the legal possession as was shown by the proof&nbsp; before&nbsp; the justice of the peace.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sinsuangco was the person who was in the actual possession and Miller should have known this and he should&nbsp; have known at the time he entered into the contract with&nbsp; the plaintiff&nbsp; that he could not place&nbsp; the plaintiff in legal,&nbsp; peaceful,&nbsp; and quiet possession&nbsp; of this lot.&nbsp; The plaintiff took possession under these&nbsp; circumstances and proceeded to construct the chapel,&nbsp; which was afterwards destroyed&nbsp; in the&nbsp; execution of the judgment of the&nbsp; justice of&nbsp; the peace.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the&nbsp; contract&nbsp; entered into between Miller and the plaintiff,&nbsp; it was Miller's&nbsp; duty to place the&nbsp; plaintiff legally in possession of&nbsp; this&nbsp; lot and maintain him in the peaceful and quiet possession of&nbsp; the same during the entire period of the contract.<br><br>The rights and obligations of lessor and lessee are treated in articles&nbsp; 1554 to 1574, inclusive, of the Civil Code.&nbsp; Article 1554 provides:<br><blockquote>"The lessor is obligated:<br><center><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*<br></center><br>"3. To maintain the lessee in&nbsp; the peaceful enjoyment of the premises for the entire period of the contract."<br></blockquote>Article 1568&nbsp; is as follows:<br><blockquote>"If the thing leased&nbsp; is lost or&nbsp; any of&nbsp; the contracting parties do&nbsp; not&nbsp; comply&nbsp; with what has&nbsp; been stipulated, the provisions&nbsp; of article&nbsp; 1182&nbsp; and 1183 shall be respectively observed."<br></blockquote>Article 1101&nbsp; provides:<br><blockquote>"Those who&nbsp; in&nbsp; fulfilling their obligations are guilty&nbsp; of fraud, negligence,&nbsp; or delay, and&nbsp; those&nbsp; who in any manner whatsoever act&nbsp; in contravention&nbsp; of the stipulations of the same,&nbsp; shall be&nbsp; subject to&nbsp; indemnify&nbsp; for&nbsp; the losses and damages caused thereby."<br></blockquote>Under this contract of lease it was&nbsp; the duty&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants to give the plaintiff the legal&nbsp; possession of the premises.&nbsp; This they did not do.<br><br>The defendants&nbsp; failed in the performance of their contract, and, as we have seen&nbsp; by article 1101&nbsp; of the Civil Code, the person who fails in the performance of his obligations shall be&nbsp; subject&nbsp; to indemnify for the&nbsp; losses and damages&nbsp; caused thereby.&nbsp;&nbsp; "The true measure of damages for the breach of such a contract is what the plaintiff has lost by the breach."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Lock <i>vs.</i> Furze, L. R. 1, C. P., 441; Dexter <i>vs</i>. Manley, 4 Cush. (Mass.), 14.)<br><br>The sum of P402,&nbsp; in our opinion, not being excessive damages for the injuries caused by the breach of contract on the part of the defendants, the judgment&nbsp; should&nbsp; be and the&nbsp; same&nbsp; is hereby&nbsp; affirmed, with&nbsp; costs against the appellants.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J.,&nbsp; Mapa, Carson,</i> and <i>Moreland, JJ.,</i> concur.<br></div>
