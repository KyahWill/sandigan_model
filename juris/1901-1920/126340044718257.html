				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The plaintiffs brought this action to recover the possession of a chapel and the convent annexed thereto situated in the barrio of Conception, in  the pueblo of Tambobong, in the Province  of Rizal.  It is stated  in a document presented by the defendants that a  chapel  had existed on this site for  more than  one hundred years.   The court  below made the following  finding  of fact:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Tercero. Que desde tiempo inmemorial hasta el aiio de 1902 dicha capilla ha sido destinada  constantemente a las ceremonias del  culto de  la religion  Catolica  Apostolica Romana habiendo  sido  invariables  sacerdotes catolicos apostolieos romanos los unicos que en  ella decian misa y ejercian el ministerio  de la predicacion y la  administracion de  los sacramentos  del bautismo y de la confesion hasta el mes de Diciembre  de 1902  en que la  comunion aglipayana celebro  sus cultos en dicha visita y entro en posesion de la  misma hasta  la fecha."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The evidence, as well of the plaintiffs as of the defendants, supports this finding and there is no evidence whatever to the contrary.</p>
<p>The buildings standing upon the site in question were destroyed by an earthquake in 1880 and their reconstruction was at once commenced and completed within a few years.  The work of reconstruction  was performed, and the materials  therefor furnished by the inhabitants of the barrio.  One witness for the plaintiffs, Bias Marcelo, describes in detail the manner of construction, specifying the names of the  persons  who contributed to  the erection of particular  parts of the  buildings  and of persons  who donated ornaments and  other articles for the use of the church.  The  witnesses for the defendants, with  one exception, all stated, when asked who the owner of the chapel was, that is was owned by the people of the barrio.  After its construction it was maintained and repairs  were made thereon by  the contributions of the Roman Catholics living in the barrio and pueblo.  On the 26th of November, 1902, forcible possession  of  the chapel was taken by representatives of the Independent Filipino Church and since that time the worship therein has been in accordance with the rites of that church.  What proportion of the people of the barrio belong  to the Independent Church  and what proportion belong to the Roman  Catholic  Church does not appear.  There was, however, presented in evidence by the plaintiffs a document signed by 134 persons in which they stated that their desire was that the chapel should  be used for the purposes of the religion  professed by the  Roman Catholic Church.</p>
<p>That  this building is a church, is consecrated as such, and  was used, occupied, and  possessed by the  Roman Catholic Church, as a corporation, from the earliest times down to November, 1902, is  clearly established  by the evidence.  This case is therefore ruled  by  what has been decided in  the case of Barlin vs. Ramirez<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> (5 Off, Oaz., 130).  To the authorities mentioned in that case  may be added the following statement by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of the Mormon Church vs.  The United States (136 U. S. at p. 53):</p>
<p>By the Spanish law,  whatever was given to the service of God became incapable1 of private ownership, being' held by the clergy as guardians or trustees; and any part not minimi for their own support, and the repairs, books, and furniture of the church, was devoted to works of piety, such as  feeding  and  clothing the  poor,  supporting  orphans, marrying poor virgins, redeeming captives, and the like. (<em>Partida</em> 3, tit. 2S,  11, 12-15.)   When property was given for a particular object, as a church, a hospital, a convent or a community, etc., and the object failed, the  property did not revert to the donor, or his heirs, but devolved to the Crown, the church,  or other convent or community, unless the  donation  contained an express condition in writing to the contrary.   (Tapia,<em> Febrero Novisimo</em>, lib. 2, tit. 4,  cap. 24-21.)"'</p>
<p>It follows that the Roman  Catholic  Church is entitled to the exclusive possession and occupancy of the  property mentioned in the complaint.</p>
<p>The principal claim set up by the defense in its brief is that there existed, and still exists, in the barrio of Concepcion a cnfrwlla; that this cofrudia was and is a  juridical entity; that it constructed this church building  and convent, lias always had the possession thereof, and has always been and now is the  owner thereof, and that among the defendants in  this action is the henuano mayor, an officer of the <em>cofradia</em>, who is charged with the administration of its affairs.</p>
<p>The proof does not sustain this claim.   No evidence of any  kind was presented  to show  the  formation of this alleged cofratlin in the manner pointed out by the laws existing prior  to the treaty of Paris.  No document setting forth the organization of the vofradia or its purposes or objects was introduced, nor does  the parol evidence presented at the trial show any of these things.  A great many witnesses were examined  both  for the  plaintiffs and  for the defendants.   With the exception of Angel Luna, the last witness for the defense, no one of them mentions the existence of this <em>cofradia</em>.  Several of them were asked if there  existed a <em>cofradia</em> or <em>hermandad </em>among the unbaptized Chinese in the town but no one  of the witnesses, even of the defendants, with the exception of Luna, testified to the existence of a <em>cofradia</em> such  as  is referred  to in the brief  of  the  appellants.   The last witness presented  by the defendants, Angel Luna, made use of the word <em>cofradia</em>. The following questions were asked him and the  following answers were given "by him in  reference thereto:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"J.  Que es lo que constituye esa <em>cofradia</em> que V. dice?— T. Creo que  es  la reunion de los vecinos  entre ellos los hermanos mayores que son los que tienen la representacion de los del barrio.</p>
  <p>"A.  Que fundamento tiene V. para creer que esos representan los intereses del barrio  de la Conception?—T. Porque son los que me nan nombrado hermano mayor.</p>
  <p>"A. Quienes  eran los que le ban  nombrado a V. hermano mayor?—T. Don Martin Esguerrn, Manuel Tuason, Lino Paez,  y varios vecinos que no puedo mencionarlos en este momento,  mas o menos de cincuenta vecinos, todos del barrio de la Concepcion tomaron parte en la junta (pie me eligio en los cuales firmaron en el acta de mi nombramiento que no lo lie trafdo aqui pero lo tengo en mi casa.</p>
  <p>"A. Y a esta junta  llama V.  la <em>cofradia</em> del barrio  de la Concepcion?—T. Si señor."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The memorandum to which he refers is dated the 2d day of October, 1902.  It  recites, among other  things,  that the church and convent were erected  by the hermanos <em>mayores</em> or <em>cofradia</em>, but it will be noticed that this document was drawn up in October, 1902,  after difficulties had arisen  between the Roman Catholic Church and  the Independent  Filipino Church,  and its recitals are  therefore entitled to  no weight.  The evidence does  not show that there ever existed in the barrio any such organization as a <em>cofradia</em>.</p>
<p>All  of the witnesses, however, both of the plaintiffs and of the defendants, testified that there was a person called the  <em>hermano  mayor</em> (eldest  brother)  and that  he was charged with  the supervision  of the building", keeping the keys thereof, the collection of the contributions, the making of repairs and the arrangements for the celebration of the <em>fiesta</em> of the  barrio.  As to  the way  in  which  he was elected the witnesses differ.  Some of the  witnesses for the  defendants my  he  was elected  by  the people of the barrio; others that  he  was elected  by the ex<em>-hermanos mayores</em>;  others  that he was  elected  by the principal contributors to  the  maintenance of the church; but  in whatever  way he was elected,  it is  very apparent from the  evidence that the existence of such a functionary in no way proves the existence of  a juridical entity  such as a <em>cofradia</em> in which  was based the legal title to this property.  He was rather the representative of the barrio than the  representative of a <em>cofradia</em>; in fact,  many of the witnesses for the defendants testified that the church was owned by the barrio, represented by  the  hermano mayor. The  necessity  for some such person is apparent when it is considered that these buildings constituted a visita or hermita which had no resident priest.  From time immemorial the  risita or chapel  had been  administered by the parish priest  of Tambobong, who did not reside,  of course, in the barrio. There being no resident priest, it was necessary that some person, resident in the barrio, should be charged with the care of the  buildings  and in this  case that person was  called the <em>hermano mayor.</em></p>
<p>The defendants in their answer set up the defense  of <em>res adjudicata,</em> and alleged that in a former suit between the same parties concerning the possession of these buildings  a final judgment had been rendered in favor of the defendants which still remained  in force.   At the  trial, however, they offered no evidence  in  support of  these allegations of  their answer.</p>
<p>The  judgment of tlie court  below is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against  the  defendants.</p>
<p>After the expiration  of twenty days  let  judgment be entered in  accordance herewith and  ten  days thereafter let the record be remanded to the court below for proper action.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Carson,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<em>Johnson, J.,</em> reserves his vote.<br>
