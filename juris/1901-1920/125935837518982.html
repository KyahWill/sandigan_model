				G.R. No. 927, November 08, 1902</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE, VS. JAIME  UBINANA; DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.

				<BR><STRONG>LADD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> The alleged  libel upon the private  prosecutor was  contained in a letter which the evidence shows was written by the defendant in the course of an illicit correspondence with the private prosecutor's wife, and which was sent to her by the defendant, read  by her, and finally discovered by her husband in her possession.  We do not understand that it  is claimed by counsel  for the defendant that  the language of  the letter is not defamatory, but it appears to be claimed that the "private, confidential,  and secret" character of the letter is sufficient to rebut the presumption that the publication was  malicious.</p>
<p> The  new  libel law, under which this prosecution  was brought, attaches the presumption of malice to  an injurious publication, "if no justifiable motive for making it is shown."   (Act of the United States  Philippine Commission, No. 277, sec. 3.)   Without undertaking to state what motives may be deemed justifiable under this  act, it is sufficient  with reference to the present case to say that it would involve a contradiction in terms to hold that  the letter in question—a solicitation to commit adultery—was published by  the  defendant  with justificable  motives. There is nothing in the case to rebut the presumption of malice which arises from the mere fact of publication.</p>
<p> It is  further claimed that it was not shown that  the defendant parted with the custody of the letter "under such circumstances that as a natural and  logical consequence it might be  read  by a third person."  Section 5 of  the Libel Act provides that "to sustain a charge of publishing a  libel,   *  *  *  it  is  enough that the  accused  knowingly parted with the immediate custody of the libel under circumstances which  exposed it  to be read or  seen by any other person than  himself."  The circumstances of the present case meet  these conditions fully. An examination of the record shows that the statement of counsel that the court below did not permit the defendant to testify at the trial in his own behalf, upon  which the first assignment of error is based, is not true  in point of fact  The same is the case with reference to the statement upon which the second assignment of error is based, viz, that the court permitted the wife of the private prosecutor to  testify without the previous consent  of both spouses.</p>
<p> The judgment of the  court below is affirmed,  the subsidiary imprisonment  in case of insolvency to be at the rate of one day for every 12½ pesetas, such imprisonment not  to exceed six months  in all. The record  will  be returned to the  court below for the execution of the judgment.  So ordered.</p>
<p> <em> Arellano, C. J., Torres, Cooper,  Smith, Willard,</em> and <em>Mapa, JJ.,</em>  concur.</p>
