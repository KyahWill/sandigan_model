				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS.  SIA TAO AND SIA POY, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>TRACEY, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The two accused calling at a Chinese shop in Santa Cruz, Manila, where Sia&nbsp; Ta was employed, seeking to collect a debt from him, came to blows with him and&nbsp; he received a black eye.&nbsp; On his complaint they&nbsp; were arrested, together with&nbsp; one&nbsp; Sia Yeng, who had accompanied&nbsp; them, but who was discharged upon the trial, while they were held guilty and sentenced to two months and one day of imprisonment and the payment of one-half the costs.<br><br>The defense presented was that Sia Ta's eye had been blackened in a fall that he received while overeagerly pursuing them.&nbsp; The probabilities of the story appear to lie with the prosecution.<br><br>The&nbsp; Attorney-General in his brief suggests that the. judgment should be modified by adding thereto indemnity to&nbsp; the&nbsp; extent of P50 for more than eight days&nbsp; of disability&nbsp; from the injury.&nbsp;&nbsp; We&nbsp; think&nbsp; that this was a case in which the judge, instead of awarding indemnity, properly reserved to the offended person his right, if any, to recover the same in a civil action, inasmuch as the proof as to the duration of the disability is unsatisfactory and the bill of the physician is not free from suspicion.&nbsp; It appears to be a necessary corollary from our decision in Almeida <i>vs.</i> Abaroa (8 Phil. Rep., 178), that the power to make such a reservation&nbsp; still exists in these Islands.<br><br>The judgment should be modified by substituting <i>arresto mayor </i>instead of <i>prision</i>, and by imposing upon each of the&nbsp; condemned one-third of the costs of&nbsp; first instance instead of one-half, and as so modified is affirmed, with the costs of this instance to be divided evenly between&nbsp; them.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Johnson,&nbsp; Carson, </i>and <i>Willard, JJ., </i>concur. </div>
