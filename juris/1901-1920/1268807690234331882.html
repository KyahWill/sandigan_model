				<BR><BR><div align="justify">We find the proven facts as brought out in the trial of this case to be as 
follows.
<p>Doroteo Natividad on the afternoon of October 22, 1915, fastened his carabao 
valued at P150 in his corral situated in the barrio of Trapiche, municipality of 
Tanauan, Province of Batangas. On the following morning when he went to look 
after the animal, he found the gate to the corral open and that the carabao had 
disappeared. He reported the matter to the Constabulary, and a patrol of the 
Constabulary under the leadership of sergeant Presa, now deceased, on the 20th 
of November following, encountered the accused Lazaro Javier, Apolinario 
Mendoza, and Placido de Chavez leading a carabao. When the <em>ladrones</em> saw 
the Constabulary, they scattered in all directions. On the following day, the 
Constabulary found this carabao tied in front of the house of one Pedro 
Monterola in the barrio of Santa Clara, municipality of San Pablo. The carabao 
was identified by Doroteo Natividad as the one which had been taken from his 
corral on the night of October 22, 1915, and by the Constabulary as the one seen 
in the possession of the accused.</p>
<p>As corroborative of such evidence, we have the well-known legal principle, 
which as applied to cases of this character is that, although the persons who 
unlawfully took a certain carabao are not recognized at the time, and their 
identity remains entirely unknown, nevertheless, if the stolen animal is found 
in the possession of the accused shortly after the commission of the crime and 
they make no satisfactory explanation of such possession they may be properly 
convicted of the crime. (See U. S. <em>vs</em>. Divino [1911], 18 Phil., 425.) 
In the present instance, the attempt of the accused to insinuate that one of the 
Constabulary soldiers testified against them falsely because of enmity is hardly 
believable.</p>
<p>The foregoing statement of the facts and the law disposes of all but one 
assignment of error, namely, that the lower court erred in admitting Exhibit B 
of the prosecution as evidence. Exhibit B is the sworn statement of sergeant 
Presa, now deceased, whose signature was identified, before the justice of the 
peace of the municipality of Santo Tomas, Province of Batangas. Appellant's 
argument is predicated on the provision of the Philippine Bill of Rights which 
says, "That in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right * * * 
to meet the witnesses face to face," and the provision of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure, section 15 (5), which says that "In all criminal prosecutions the 
defendant shall be entitled: * * * to be confronted at the trial by and to 
cross-examine the witnesses against him." With reference to the clause of the 
Bill of Rights, which we have quoted, Justice Day said in a case of Philippine 
origin (Dowdell <em>vs</em>. U. S. [1911], 221 U. S., 325) that it "intends to 
secure the accused in the right to be tried, so far as facts provable by 
witnesses are concerned, by only such witnesses as meet him face to face at the 
trial, who give their testimony in his presence, and give to the accused an 
opportunity of cross-examination. It was intended to prevent the conviction of 
the accused upon depositions or <em>ex parte</em> affidavits, and particularly 
to preserve the right of the accused to test the recollection of the witness in 
the exercise of the right of .cross-examination." In other words, confrontation 
is essential because cross-examination is essential. A second reason for the 
prohibition is that a tribunal may have before it the deportment and appearance 
of the witness while testifying. (U. S. <em>vs</em>. Anastasio [1906], 6 Phil., 
413.) The Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands has applied this 
constitutional provision on behalf of accused persons in a number of cases. (See 
for example U. S. <em>vs</em>. Tanjuanco [1902], 1 Phil., 374; U. S. 
<em>vs</em>. Bello [1908], 11 Phil., 526; U. S. <em>vs</em>. De la Cruz [1908], 
12 Phil., 87.) It is for us now to determine whether the present facts entitle 
the accused to the protection of the Bill of Rights or whether the facts fall 
under some exception thereto. </p>
<p>The sworn statement of Presa was not made by question I and answer under 
circumstances which gave the defense an opportunity to cross-examine the 
witness. The proviso of the Code of Criminal Procedure as to confrontation is 
therefore inapplicable. Presa's statement again is not the testimony of a 
witness deceased, given in a former action between the same parties relating to 
the same matter. Consequently, the exception provided by section 298, No. 8) of 
the Code of Civil Procedure and relied upon by the prosecution in the lower 
court is also inapplicable. Nor is the statement of Presa a dying declaration or 
a deposition in a former trial or shown to be a part of the preliminary 
examination. Under these circumstances, not to burden the opinion with an 
extensive citation of authorities, we can rely on the old and historic case of 
R. <em>vs</em>. Paine (1 Salk., 281 [King's Bench Div.]) occurring in the year 
1696. It appears that a deposition of B., examined by the Mayor of Bristol under 
oath, but not in P's presence, was offered. It was objected that B, being dead, 
the defendant had lost all opportunity of cross-examining him. The King's Bench 
consulted with the Common Pleas, and "it was the opinion of both courts that 
these depositions should not be given in evidence, the defendant not being 
present when they were taken before the Mayor and so had lost the benefit of a 
cross-examination." Although we are faced with the alternative of being unable 
to utilize the statements of the witness now deceased, yet if there1 has been no 
opportunity for cross-examination and the case is not one coming within " one of 
the exceptions, the mere necessity alone of accepting the statement will not 
suffice. In fine, Exhibit B was improperly received in evidence in the lower 
court.</p>
<p>With such a resolution of this question, we could, as has been done in other 
cases, further find this to be reversible error and remand the case for a new 
trial. We are convinced, however, that this would gain the accused nothing 
except delay for the testimony of the owner of the carabao and of the two 
Constabulary soldiers, rebutted by no reasonable evidence on behalf of the 
accused, is deemed sufficient to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>The facts come under article 518, No. 3, in connection with article 520, as 
amended, of the Penal Code. Accordingly the defendants and appellants are each 
sentenced to four years, two months, and one day of <em>presidio 
correctional</em>, with the accessory penalties provided by law, and to pay 
one-third part of the costs of both instances; the carabao shall be returned to 
Doroteo Natividad, if this has not already been done. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson, Carson, Araullo, Street</em>, and 
<em>Avance√±a, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
