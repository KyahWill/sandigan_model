				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"> This&nbsp; is an action upon "the warranty of&nbsp; the&nbsp; title&nbsp; to a parcel of land."&nbsp;&nbsp; After hearing the&nbsp; cause&nbsp; in&nbsp; the lower court,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Honorable&nbsp; Judge&nbsp; H.&nbsp; D.&nbsp; Gale rendered the following decision, which&nbsp; we adopt as&nbsp; a true statement of the facts found in the record with a conclusion in accordance with the law and the facts.<br><blockquote>"The court is convinced that the plaintiff, Don&nbsp; Leopoldo Canizares Tiana, purchased from the&nbsp; defendant, Don Jose Maria Torrejon, for the sum&nbsp; of P2,500, a lot&nbsp; with&nbsp; buildings and improvements,&nbsp; situate in the&nbsp; municipality of Jolo, same district,&nbsp; Moro Province, Philippine Islands, description and&nbsp; boundaries whereof are as follows:<br><br>" 'On the north by Calle P. Mir for a distance of twenty-two meters and ten centimeters; on the south by the property of Rojas&nbsp; Reyes &amp;&nbsp; Co., or Sr. Tiana, for a distance of twenty-two&nbsp; meters and ten&nbsp; centimeters; on the west by Calle Garcia Loranca, for a&nbsp; distance&nbsp; of&nbsp; eighteen meters and ninety&nbsp; centimeters; and on the east by a commissary building,&nbsp; for a&nbsp; distance&nbsp; of&nbsp; eighteen&nbsp; meters and ninety centimeters.'<br><br>"At the sale of the said lot&nbsp; and improvements,&nbsp; the vendor, Jose Maria Torrejon, warranted the title thereto as appears from the wording of the contract of sale and purchase, dated June&nbsp; 17, 1905&nbsp; (Exhibit&nbsp; B of the plaintiff), which states:<br><br>"'I further covenant and agree to be responsible to the aforesaid Leopoldo Canizares Tiana,&nbsp; his&nbsp; heirs and successors&nbsp; in interest, for the property,&nbsp; and bind myself to defend the title thereto now and forever against any just claims, by whomsoever presented.'<br><br>"Before executing the&nbsp; deed of sale to the estate in&nbsp; question, that is, on April 12, 1905, the defendant, Jose Maria Torrejon, filed&nbsp; an application in the Court of Land Registration (case No. 1440), requesting registration of the land and improvements&nbsp; (Exhibit&nbsp; A of the plaintiff; p.&nbsp; 53 of the record), the same as&nbsp; described in&nbsp; Exhibit B of the plaintiff.<br><br>"Although the said Torrejon had executed the&nbsp; deed of sale to the land and&nbsp; improvements in&nbsp; favor of Tiana, he continued to prosecute the case, No. 1440, and it was heard on February 28, 1906 (Exhibit A of the plaintiff; page 76 of the record).&nbsp;&nbsp; The participation and intervention, either direct or indirect, of the&nbsp; vendee Tiana, did not&nbsp; appear until March 1, 1906, when Torrejon presented a written statement to the effect&nbsp; that&nbsp; he had transferred&nbsp; all his rights in the property in&nbsp; question to Tiana.&nbsp; Tiana continued the&nbsp; prosecution of&nbsp; the case&nbsp; in the usual manner until decision therein was rendered on November 15, 1906, (p.105 of the record).&nbsp; The defendant, Jose Maria Torrejon, was&nbsp; informed of this decision, the result whereof appears in Exhibit C of the plaintiff, page 117 of the record. Tiana asked the court for&nbsp; a continuation in&nbsp; order&nbsp; to present more evidence in support&nbsp; of the requested registration of the property which is&nbsp; the. subject of the present litigation, doing this in compliance&nbsp; with instructions&nbsp; from Torrejon, as appears from the letter written by the latter, presented in this&nbsp; case as Exhibit C of the plaintiff.&nbsp; The court granted this request and continued the&nbsp; case until July 14, 1907 (pp. Ill and 112 of the record), and notification of this action by the court was transmitted to Torrejon&nbsp; (Exhibit G of the plaintiff,&nbsp; p.122&nbsp; of the record) During the period granted by the court, the plaintiff Tiana requested the&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; Torrejon, on&nbsp; various&nbsp; occasions, to bring forward the evidence required (Exhibits G, I, J, and K), but the latter failed to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp; On August 8, 1908, the court&nbsp; issued a decree dismissing the application&nbsp; in case No. 1440&nbsp; and declaring the estate in question to be public property&nbsp; (p. 112 of the record,&nbsp; Exhibit A), and notification thereof was sent to Torrejon (Exhibit D of the plaintiff, p. 119&nbsp; of the record). It&nbsp; further&nbsp; appears that&nbsp; the lot with its buildings and improvements, the subject of this litigation, passed into the possession of the military authorities in the&nbsp; month of May, 1908; that the plaintiff Tiana received no payment whatsoever for it; and that, at that time, the value of it was P2,500, the amount for which Torrejon sold it to Tiana.&nbsp; Since the&nbsp; said&nbsp; month of May, 1908, or about the middle thereof, when the plaintiff in the present suit was deprived of possession, the estate has produced rent at the rate of P36 a month, of which the plaintiff has&nbsp; also been&nbsp; deprived.&nbsp; On December 14, 1909, the plaintiff Tiana&nbsp; demanded&nbsp; that the&nbsp; defendant Torrejon return or repay to him the sum of P2,500&nbsp; (Exhibit F of the plaintiff, p. 121 of the record).&nbsp;&nbsp; It further appears that Torrejon knew of the Government's objection to the application in case No.&nbsp; 1440 (p. 76 of the record, Exhibit A), and that the land, buildings and improvements, described in case No. 1440, were wholly included within&nbsp; the&nbsp; boundaries of&nbsp; the military&nbsp; reservation of&nbsp; Jolo, Sulu, Moro Province, P. I.<br><br>"Finally, it appears that the land,&nbsp; buildings and improvements described and specified in case No. 1440 of the Court of&nbsp; Land Registration,&nbsp; are&nbsp; the same&nbsp; land,&nbsp; buildings&nbsp; and improvements involved in the present suit,&nbsp; described&nbsp; and specified in&nbsp; Exhibit&nbsp; B&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff,&nbsp; page 115&nbsp; of the record, and paragraph 3 of the complaint.<br><br>"This&nbsp; is&nbsp; an action upon the warranty of the&nbsp; title to the property in case&nbsp; of eviction, under article 1475 of the Civil Code.&nbsp; In&nbsp; such case&nbsp; there&nbsp; are three indispensable requisites:&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; Final judgment;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; that the vendee be deprived of the&nbsp; whole&nbsp; or a part of the thing sold; and, (3)&nbsp; a right prior to&nbsp; the sale (Manresa on the Civil Code, volume 10, pages 161 to 170);&nbsp; and, finally,&nbsp; another indispensable requisite is that prescribed in article 1481 of the Civil Code: that the vendor be given notice of the suit at the instance&nbsp; of the vendee.&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp; the merits of the present case, and the preponderance of the plaintiff's evidence, and from the facts&nbsp; established, all the foregoing requisites&nbsp; appear herein.&nbsp; In his brief&nbsp; the defendant&nbsp; alleges that the&nbsp; decree&nbsp; issued in case No. 1440 was not final and that the&nbsp; plaintiff could&nbsp; and should have appealed from it. Such&nbsp; a case is&nbsp; expressly decided by the illustrious and learned author, Manresa, in his commentaries on the Civil Code, volume 10, page&nbsp; 163, in&nbsp; the&nbsp; following manner:<br><br>" 'Can the vendor escape&nbsp; his&nbsp; obligation&nbsp; of warranty by alleging&nbsp; that although there&nbsp; may&nbsp; be&nbsp; a&nbsp; final judgment against the vendee, such judgment became final with&nbsp; the latter's consent?&nbsp; We understand not, and that the vendee's right does not suffer the least impairment because he&nbsp; did not appeal.'<br><br>"With reference to the allegation of the defendant, Torrejon,&nbsp; that he was not&nbsp; notified&nbsp; of the suit, that&nbsp; is, of the objection presented by&nbsp; the&nbsp; government&nbsp; in case No. 1440, he can not set up such a defense, for he was himself the applicant in that&nbsp; case, without&nbsp; the&nbsp; intervention of Tiana, and such objection on the part of the government to his&nbsp; claims already subsisted.<br><br>"By virtue of the foregoing considerations, and of&nbsp; the facts&nbsp; established&nbsp; in this cause, the court holds that&nbsp; the plaintiff, Don Leopoldo Canizares Tiana, is entitled to&nbsp; recover from the defendant, Don Jose Maria Torrejon,&nbsp; the sum of P2,500, the price of the real estate involved&nbsp; in&nbsp; the present suit, and&nbsp; that he is also entitled to receive&nbsp; the sum of P36 a month&nbsp; from May,&nbsp; 1908,&nbsp; up to the day on which&nbsp; this judgment is executed.&nbsp; With reference to&nbsp; the counterclaim of the defendant, the court is of the opinion that he has no right to recover anything from the plaintiff.<br><br>"The court sentences the defendant, Jose Maria Torrejon, to restore to Don Leopoldo Canizares Tiana,&nbsp; the sum of P2,500,&nbsp; the value&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; lot,&nbsp; buildings and improvements&nbsp; involved in&nbsp; the&nbsp; present suit, described&nbsp; and&nbsp; specified in this decision, and to pay to said Tiana P36 a month from May, 1908, up to the day on which this judgment is executed; and further sentences the defendant to pay&nbsp; the costs of this judgment."<br></blockquote>The defendant appealed from the foregoing judgment to this court and filed a bill&nbsp; of exceptions.<br><br>Without discussing the errors assigned or reviewing&nbsp; the case more extensively, and without prejudice to the writing of a more elaborate decision, the&nbsp; judgment of the lower court is affirmed, with costs.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J.,&nbsp; Torres, Mapa,&nbsp; Carson,</i>&nbsp; and <i>Trent,&nbsp; JJ</i>., concur.<br></div>
