				<H3>JUAN POIZAT, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. GEORGE MORGAN AND THE NEGROS PHILIPPINE LUMBER CO., DEFENDANTS. THE NEGROS PHILIPPINE LUMBER CO., APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MORELAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from an order of the Court of First Instance of Manila 
denying a motion to set aside a judgment against the appellant, based upon the 
ground that there was no service of summons on it.
<p>The appellant is a foreign corporation doing business in the Philippine 
Islands. In pursuance of the provisions of section 68 of Act No. 1459, known as 
the Corporation Law, the appellant company, prior to the beginning of the action 
which culminated in the judgment complained of, had filed in the division of 
archives a written statement under oath containing, among other things, the name 
of an agent residing in the Philippine Islands authorized by the corporation to 
accept service of summons and processes in all local proceedings against the 
corporation and of all notices affecting it. The summons in the action in which 
the judgment was entered was admittedly no served on the agent so named by the 
corporation but upon a person who was, the appellant claims, simply an employee 
thereof.</p>
<p>There is much discussion by counsel as to whether or not the person upon whom 
the summons was actually served was, under section 396 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure, the "managing agent" or said corporation. We do not believe it 
necessary to enter upon a consideration of that matter. We are of the opinion 
that, where a foreign corporation has designated a person to receive service of 
summons in judicial proceedings and other notices affecting the corporation, 
that designation is exclusive and that service of summons is without force or 
effect unless made upon him. Where such a person has been designated, section 
396 of the Code of Civil Procedure above referred to is not applicable, and the 
only person upon whom summons can be served is the person so designated. Where, 
however, the foreign corporation has neglected or refused to designate such a 
person, then the provisions of section 396 of the Code of Civil Procedure and 
section 72 of Act No. 1459 are applicable and control the service.</p>
<p>It being undisputed that the foreign corporation had, prior to the beginning 
of the action, designated the person upon whom summons should be served, and it 
being also undisputed that the summons in the action in which the judgment 
complained of was entered was not served upon that person, it necessarily 
follows that the summons was not served in accordance with the law and that the 
court, therefore, obtained no jurisdiction over the person of the appellant. It 
not appearing from the record that jurisdiction was obtained by the voluntary 
general appearance of the appellant in the action, the court in entering the 
judgment lacked jurisdiction over the person of the appellant and its judgment 
was accordingly subject to attack upon that ground.</p>
<p>Where judgment is defective by reason of the failure of service of summons 
upon the defendant, it may be attacked by motion made to set it aside. The 
motion in this case was properly made and should have been sustained. </p>
<p>The judgment [order] appealed from is reversed and the judgment in 
controversy is set aside and declared of no force and effect. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson, Carson, Trent,</em> and <em>Araullo, 
JJ.,</em> concur.<br></p></div>
