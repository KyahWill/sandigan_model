				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appellant in this case duly excepted to the judgment in the court&nbsp; below and moved for&nbsp; a new trial on&nbsp; the ground that the judgment entered therein is contrary to the weight of the evidence.&nbsp; This motion having been overruled, he filed his bill of exceptions, wherein he prayed that the evidence submitted at the trial be taken as a part thereof.&nbsp; This bill of exceptions was approved&nbsp; and duly certified by the trial judge.<p>It now appears that the record thus certified is defective, in that it contains only the documentary evidence submitted at the trial&nbsp; and does not&nbsp; contain the certified transcript of the stenographer's notes&nbsp; of the oral evidence taken at the trial in the court&nbsp; below.</p><p>Appellant has thus far failed to&nbsp; perfect the record,&nbsp; although his attention has&nbsp; been called thereto,&nbsp; and indeed it would appear from his assignment of errors that he has abandoned his contention in the court below based&nbsp; upon his allegation that the evidence of record does not sustain the judgment to which he excepted.</p><p>The rule of practice adopted in this court in a case wherein a motion&nbsp; has been filed in&nbsp; the court below on the ground that the evidence&nbsp; taken therein is not sufficient&nbsp; to sustain the judgment, and wherein it appears that all of the material&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; has not&nbsp; been brought here&nbsp; on appeal&nbsp; is: First,&nbsp; to grant a new trial on the motion of the appellant if it appears that the defect in the record is due to circumstances over which the appellant had&nbsp; no control, and that he has exercised due diligence in an effort to cure the defect: second, to decline to grant a new trial where it appears that the appellant (whose duty it is to bring the perfected record here on&nbsp; appeal), has willfully or negligently failed to include in the&nbsp; record all or any part of the evidence submitted at the trial; and to proceed&nbsp; to review the record brought here on appeal,&nbsp; wholly disregarding the evidence taken in the court below, precisely as we would in an appeal&nbsp; in a case wherein no motion for a new trial is&nbsp; submitted in the court below.&nbsp; In such cases&nbsp; this court examines only the assignments of error of law, and limits itself to an examination of the pleadings and the findings of fact by the&nbsp; trial court, seeking to determine whether the judgment rendered by the trial&nbsp; court is or&nbsp; is not in accord with&nbsp; the&nbsp; facts proven at the trial.</p><p>In the case at bar, therefore, appellant&nbsp; having failed to bring all the evidence here with his bill of exceptions, and his failure so to do appearing to be intentional, he&nbsp; is not entitled&nbsp; to a new trial, and,&nbsp; under the rules, the appellee is entitled to have the proceedings on appeal go forward to judgment without delay, as indicated above.</p><p>Counsel for&nbsp; appellee, however, suggests that while the evidence taken at the trial fully sustains&nbsp; the judgment of the court below, it is possible that the formal findings of fact by&nbsp; the trial judge are so&nbsp; deficient or so imperfectly stated that the judgment can not be sustained on them alone. He fears, therefore, that if the court proceeds to judgment on appeal without having&nbsp; all the&nbsp; evidence before it, the judgment of the lower court may be reversed and&nbsp; the case sent back for a new trial merely because of defects&nbsp; in the findings&nbsp; of fact by the trial judge, although the judgment was, in fact, fully&nbsp; sustained by the evidence taken at the trial.&nbsp;&nbsp; He insists that no such result would be possible had defendant brought the&nbsp; evidence here&nbsp; in&nbsp; accordance with his announced intention in&nbsp; the court below, and in accordance with the&nbsp; express terms of the bill of exceptions as certified&nbsp; and approved by the trial court.&nbsp; In support of his contention, counsel correctly says, that had appellant perfected his bill&nbsp; of exceptions&nbsp; by including therein all the evidence, then&nbsp; it would be the duty of this&nbsp; court, in the event that it found that the findings&nbsp; of&nbsp; the court&nbsp; below were&nbsp; insufficient or incorrect, to examine the evidence of record,&nbsp; and to&nbsp; decline to&nbsp; reverse the judgment&nbsp; on that ground,&nbsp; if the&nbsp; evidence itself discloses facts sufficient to sustain&nbsp; the judgment.</p><p>It seems clear that under the circumstances of this case the <em>appellee</em> should not be forced to risk a&nbsp; reversal and the delays and expense incident to a new trial, upon the mere question&nbsp; of the&nbsp; formal sufficiency of the findings of fact by the trial judge.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the&nbsp; court below appellee was&nbsp; satisfied with the judgment rendered in his favor.&nbsp;&nbsp; The appellant, by undertaking to make the evidence a part of the bill of exceptions, lulled him&nbsp; into&nbsp; a sense of false security as to the possibility of a reversal on the&nbsp; mere ground&nbsp; that the findings of fact by the trial court were defective or insufficient.&nbsp;&nbsp; Appellant&nbsp; having announced his intention to bring the evidence here&nbsp; on appeal, appellee knew that this court, if the evidence were in fact before it, would not reverse on that ground if the evidence itself disclosed facts sufficient to sustain the judgment.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; now too late&nbsp; for&nbsp; appellee to&nbsp; secure any amendments or&nbsp; corrections of&nbsp; errors&nbsp; or omissions in the formal&nbsp; findings of&nbsp; fact by the trial court unless this court will make such corrections, and this court can not make such corrections unless the evidence is brought here for review.</p><p>Manifestly,&nbsp; the appellant should&nbsp; not be permitted&nbsp; to profit by a surprise sprung&nbsp; on the appellee in this&nbsp; fashion. If his failure to bring the evidence here in accordance with his announced intention is the result&nbsp; of negligence,&nbsp; he should&nbsp; not&nbsp; be permitted to profit&nbsp; unfairly thereby, and much less should he profit unfairly by a deliberate and willful&nbsp; change of his announced intention to bring the evidence here on appeal.&nbsp; Of course, if the appellant desires so to do, he should be permitted to waive his contention&nbsp; in the court below that the evidence of record does not sustain the judgment, and in that&nbsp; event,&nbsp; so far as he is concerned, it would be a wholly&nbsp; useless procedure to&nbsp; go to the expense of bringing the evidence to this&nbsp; court.&nbsp; But appellant's&nbsp; change of ground of his appeal for his own convenience&nbsp; and to save himself the expense and trouble involved in&nbsp; making the evidence a part of the record, should not be permitted to have the effect of forcing the appellee to go to judgment on appeal&nbsp; without having&nbsp; the evidence taken&nbsp; at the&nbsp; trial brought before this court, in a case where the evidence would sustain the judgment of&nbsp; the court below although the findings of fact by the trial judge are so defective or erroneous that it could not be sustained on&nbsp; them alone.&nbsp; This, because in such a case, appellee may fairly claim,&nbsp; that but for the appellant's misleading conduct in undertaking originally to bring the evidence here as a&nbsp; part of the record to be submitted&nbsp; on appeal, he, the appellee, would himself have moved the court below to so amend its findings of fact&nbsp; as to make them conform with the evidence, and to render them sufficient in form and substance to sustain the judgment.</p><p>It may, perhaps, be suggested, that appellee can always protect himself from danger of reversals on the ground that the findings of fact by the trial judge do not sustain&nbsp; the judgment, by always insisting on a full and correct statement of such findings, and in the event that the judge fails or declines to make such corrections as&nbsp; may be necessary, forthwith entering an appeal&nbsp; on that ground.&nbsp; But in&nbsp; the vast majority of&nbsp; judgments&nbsp; entered in the&nbsp; court&nbsp; below, such a practice would place a&nbsp; useless and vexatious burden on successful litigants in the courts below.&nbsp; It is, in general, a&nbsp; matter&nbsp; of no importance to&nbsp; a successful litigant whether the reasons on which a judgment is based are sound or not, provided&nbsp; the judgment itself&nbsp; is in&nbsp; his favor and satisfactorily disposes of the issues involved.&nbsp; If no appeal is taken, or if an appeal is taken and the appellant makes the evidence a&nbsp; part of the record, there can rarely be any&nbsp; purpose in a vexatious proceeding by a successful litigant to compel the trial judge who has rendered&nbsp; judgment in his favor to modify&nbsp; or change the reasons on which he based his decision.&nbsp; Practically, the only cases&nbsp; where it can become a matter of importance to the successful litigant in the court below to secure the amendment or correction of an imperfect finding of facts by the trial judge, are those wherein the unsuccessful litigant appeals from the judgment, and without bringing the evidence to this court,&nbsp; seeks a reversal on the ground that the facts thus found do not sustain the judgment.&nbsp; If the appellant, while&nbsp; the case is still in the court below, rests his appeal on this ground, the appellee can there and&nbsp; then,&nbsp; if&nbsp; he&nbsp; so&nbsp; desires, move the trial court to amend its defective and&nbsp; insufficient findings; and&nbsp; if&nbsp; he fails so to do he must take the consequences.&nbsp;&nbsp; But if while the case is still pending in the&nbsp; court below, the appellant announces his intention to bring the&nbsp; evidence here on&nbsp; appeal, and&nbsp; after wards willfully or negligently&nbsp; declines&nbsp; to do so, thus misleading the appellee and inducing him&nbsp; to refrain from any effort to have defective&nbsp; and insufficient findings amended until it is too late to do so in the court below, we think that the appellee should be given an&nbsp; opportunity to have such amendments made in this court.</p><p>We are of opinion, however, that in such cases, the appellant having&nbsp; expressly&nbsp; or impliedly&nbsp; waived his&nbsp; right&nbsp; to have the evidence reviewed by this court, it then becomes the duty of the appellee to bring the&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; here, if he desires to have it reviewed for his benefit;&nbsp; that is to say, to prevent a reversal&nbsp; on the&nbsp; ground&nbsp; that the findings&nbsp; of fact by the trial judge are defective or insufficient, when a review of the evidence itself would develop facts sufficient to sustain the judgment.</p><p>It will be seen that the practice thus indicated in no wise affects the general rule of procedure where appellant fails or declines to bring to this court all of the evidence taken in the court below, except only&nbsp; to&nbsp; this&nbsp; extent, that in such cases, if the appellee brings the evidence here,&nbsp; we will not reverse the&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; entered in the&nbsp; court&nbsp; below on the sole ground of the deficiency of the findings of fact by the trial judge,&nbsp; if the evidence itself discloses&nbsp; facts sufficient to sustain the judgment.</p><p>Pursuant&nbsp; to the rule of practice herein indicated, the following order will&nbsp; be entered herein:</p><p>Appellant having failed to include all the&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; taken in the court below in the record brought here on appeal, and not having offered any excuse for his&nbsp; failure so to do,&nbsp; the proceedings on his appeal will go forward to judgment as though no motion for a new trial, on&nbsp; the ground that the weight of the evidence does not support the judgment, had been filed in the court below; unless&nbsp; within twenty days the appellee&nbsp; perfects the record by including&nbsp; therein&nbsp; the missing testimony, in which&nbsp; event, the judgment of&nbsp; the trial court will not be&nbsp; reversed on the mere ground of the insufficiency or incorrectness of the findings of fact by the trial judge,&nbsp; if the evidence thus perfected&nbsp; discloses facts. sufficient to sustain it.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is so ordered.</p><p><em>Torres, Mapa, Johnson,</em> and <em>Moreland, JJ.</em>, concur.</p></div>
