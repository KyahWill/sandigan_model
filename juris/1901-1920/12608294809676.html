  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This  is an  appeal from the judgment of the Court  of First Instance of Pangasinan dated September 20,  1900, by  wliich the defendant was sentenced to make restitution 1o  the  plaintiff,  Vicente Quesada,  administrator of the estate of Paulino Quesada, of the merchandise and effects set  forth in Exhibit A, deducting those set forth in Exhibit H of the amended complaint, or otherwise to pay to said plaintiff the sum of P2,491.65,  with interest  thereon  at the rate of (i per cent  per annum in either case, on the sum of P2,491.65,  value of the seized merchandise and effects,  from the 7th of 'March, 1906, until such property be  restored or the value thereof be paid, and to pay the costs of the action.  The appellant filed with this court a bill  of  exceptions (an  assignment of  errors), and  after due. consideration thereof this court  finds:</p>
<ol>
  <li>1. That  the court below did not  err in  declaring that the defendant, Isabelo Artacho, as sheriff for the Province of Pangasinan, unlawfully and  without any right seized and deprived Paulino Quesada, on the 7th of March,  1905, of the merchandise  and effects  claimed  by the plaintiff. If the procedure  was not illegal because it was an act  in execution of  an  order from the court, yet the persistence in  the  seizure and  the consequent  act  of dispossession carried  out in spite of the ownership  claimed by the plaintiff over certain personal property seized by the defendant made the act illegal.  In this respect  section 442 of the law (the Code of Civil Procedure), cited by the appellant himself, provides that upon claim being made by a  third party, and his affidavit  served upon the officer, the officer shall not be bound to keep the property under the attachment, initess the plaintiff, on demand of him, or his agent, indemnify the officer against such claim by an obligation with two sufficient sureties.  The court below established this conclusion:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p>"That the late Paulino Quesada was the owner by purchase from  Tan  Samco, of the merchandise and effects set forth and described in Exhibit A of the amended complaint, with the exception  of those appearing in Exhibit B, and that the  said merchandise and effects were in the possession of Paulino Quesada."   (B.  of E.,  7.)</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
  <li>.  That neither did  the court err in not declaring that the action taken herein should have been directed against the person at whose instance the attachment was levied, and against the  party  whose property had been attached. Such was the procedure  under the Ley de Enjuiciainiento Civil, formerly  in force, according to which an  officer executing an order from the court acted merely in execution of a ministerial duty that strictly  bound him to carry it out, while under the Code of Civil Procedure, at present in force, a discretional power and personal liability are involved in his functions, and he is therefore informed that he shall not be  bound  to keep  the  property  under the attachment  if it is claimed by a  third party; and for the same reason the  law in  force authorizes him (which was not the case formerly) to  consider that the claim is not a valid one  unless  made as  already  stated—that is, by (the third party claiming) setting forth under  oath his title of ownership or  his right to the possession with a statement of the grounds in support thereof; and for this reason,  finally, he is authorized  to protect  himself, if he persists in keeping property under the attachment, against the claimant, by requiring an obligation with  two  sufficient sureties who, together with the party who applied for the attachment,  shall indemnify him.  This provision would hav6 no meaning if the person to be indemnified was other than the sheriff, or if the  intervention must necessarily be against the  person who applied for the attachment and the party whose property  was attached, as in the old  Law of Civil Procedure.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> Neither did the court err in not declaring that the defendant was in no way liable for the attachment and for the return or payment of the property claimed by the plaintiff.  The court below  could make no such declaration of irresponsibility on the part of the defendant who, as  an  officer of the court,  executed the writ and kept the property under attachment, notwithstanding the claim of the third party, now the plaintiff herein; (1)  because he was cautioned by law that a claim by a third party for the property  or  for  damages suffered by  reason of the attachment could be filed against him, or, as more clearly provided in section 451, "no claim to  such  property shall be  valid  against the  officer,  or shall  be received  or' be notice of any  rights  against  him,  unless made as herein provided," to  wit, by a written claim,  verified by the oath of  such  claimant setting out his title thereto, his right to possession thereof, and stating the grounds of such title; (2) because actually and ostensibly  no other than the court officer is the one who executes the act of dispossession of the third party claiming, who is  not bound to know more than what he sees with his own eyes as the immediate, cause  for depriving him of his title or possession, and the person who remains in possession or is holding the property the recovery of which he seeks by means of  an  intervention.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> Nor have the other errors been committed, as alleged, under  the theory that the sheriff's official  acts are  of a mere ministerial nature for  which he can not be  held responsible so long as he adheres strictly to the terms of the order of the court, or to the request and indications of the party  seeking the attachment and upon  whom  the sheriff believes he can thrust all responsibility  as the real party concerned in the  matter,  for the reason that  the supposition on which such theory is based,  in view of the present method of procedure and  the general principles of the  law, is  a false one.  Under the present method of procedure a judicial  officer,  when serving  such process, has the same responsibility, with some exceptions, as any private individual who attempts to take or  hold property or possession  claimed  by a third party who has neither been heard nor defeated in an action,  and who can in no wise be  dispossessed  of what belongs to him,  and  who is  in quiet and peaceful possession  thereof.  In a  case similar to the present one, it was held by this court that—</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p>"For the purpose of limiting  the responsibility of the sheriff in  such  cases, and to provide that some notice should be given to him of the  claims of third  persons, this  section  [451]  requires such third persons to make such claims in Avriting, so that the sheriff, after the notice is given to him, can decide for himself whether he will  proceed with the levy or abandon the  property.   (Waite vs. Peterson et al.,  5 Off. Gaz., 556.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>)"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed with the costs of this  instance against the appellant.   So ordered.</p>
<em>Torres, Johnson, Willard,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
