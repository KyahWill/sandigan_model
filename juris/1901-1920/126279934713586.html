				G.R. No. 2815, September 11, 1906</h4>
				<H3>THE  UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. BRIGIDO SALVADOR  AND ALFONSO CAGUINGUING,  DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Brigido Salvador and Alfonso Caguinguing were charged with the crime of <span style="font-style: italic;">asesinato </span>and tried in the Court of First Instance of Manila.   The information  was dismissed as to Brigido Salvador, and as to him a judgment of acquittal was entered for lack of conclusive proof of his guilt.  Alfonso  Caguinguing  was found  guilty and  sentenced to death, and the judgment of  the  trial  court as  to him is brought here <em>en consulta.</em></p>
<p>The information charges that the crime was committed within the police jurisdiction of the city  of Manila, and an examination of the record  discloses that if committed at all it was committed at or near a place called San Francisco del Monte, which  is beyond the city limits proper, although within "a zone surrounding the city on land of five miles in width," wherein certain limited jurisdiction for police purposes was conferred upon the city government of Manila by Act No. 183 of the Philippine Commission.</p>
<p>This  court has  repeatedly held that  this act  did not extend the jurisdiction of the Courts of  First Instance of Manila so as to clothe them with  jurisdiction over crimes committed within this zone.  (United States <em>vs</em>.  Jenkins et al.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 4 Off: Gaz., 523.)  Adhering to those decisions, we are  of opinion  that the court which tried this case  was without jurisdiction over the offense charged and that all the proceedings had at the  trial were invalid and the sentence pronounced thereon was void and  of no legal effect. The judgment  and sentence brought here <em>en consulta</em> are reversed with costs of both instances <em>de oficio</em>; but since it appears from the record that  there are  reasonable grounds to believe that  Alfonso Caguinguing is guilty of the crime with which he was charged, and since that crime was a peculiarly atrocious and aggravated one, he will not be set at liberty but will be remanded to a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance  with  the provisions of section 23 of General Orders, No.  58.</p>
<p>After  ten days let judgment be entered in accordance herewith and the record returned to the court from whence it came, where such orders will be issued and such measures taken as  may be necessary in the  due execution of the judgment of this court. So ordered.</p>
<em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Willard, </em>and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
