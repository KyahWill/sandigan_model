				G.R. No. 11759, March 16, 1917</h4>
				<H3>CAYETANO LIM AND MARCIANO LIM, PETITIONERS AND APPELLANTS, VS. THE INSULAR COLLECTOR OF CUSTOMS, RESPONDENT AND APPELLEE.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The real question raised on this appeal is whether the Insular Collector of 
Customs may lawfully deny entry into the Philippine Islands to two children aged 
8 and 14 years, respectively, under and by authority of the Chinese Immigration 
Laws, it appearing that the children arrived at the Port of Manila accompanied 
by and in the custody of their mother, a Filipino woman; that they were born in 
China, out of lawful wedlock; and that their father was a Chinese person.
<p>It is contended, on behalf of the Insular Collector of Customs, that these 
children being Chinese persons are denied the right of entrance into the 
Philippine Islands under the express terms of the Chinese immigration laws. On 
the other hand, it is urged on behalf of the children that they are entitled to 
enter, regardless of the provisions of the Chinese immigration laws, since the 
admitted facts, as it is said, disclose that they are citizens of the Philippine 
Islands; and for the further reason, that their mother, who is entitled to their 
custody and charged with their maintenance and education, is clearly entitled to 
take up her residence in the Philippine Islands and should not be required, to 
that end, to abandon her minor children.</p>
<p>Without discussing or deciding any of the contentions of the parties as to 
the rights of citizenship of these children, actual or inchoate, we are of 
opinion that by analogous reasoning to that upon which the Supreme Court of the 
United States held that the wives and minor children of Chinese merchants 
domiciled in the United States may enter that country without certificates, 
these children must be held to be entitled to enter the Philippine Islands with 
their mother, for the purpose of taking up their residence here with her, it 
appearing that she is their natural guardian, entitled to their custody and 
charged with their maintenance and education. (U. S. <em>vs</em>. Gue Lim, 176 
U. S., 459.)</p>
<p>In the case just cited the court said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"While the literal construction of the section would require a certificate, 
as therein stated, from every Chinese person, other than a laborer, who should 
come into the country, yet such a construction leads to what we think an absurd 
result, for it requires a certificate for a wife of a merchant, among others, in 
regard to whom it would be impossible to give the particulars which the statute 
requires shall be stated in such certificate.</p>
<p>" 'Nothing is better settled,' says the present Chief Justice, in Lau Ow Bew 
<em>vs</em>. United States (144 U. S., 59) 'than that statutes should receive a 
sensible construction, such as will effectuate the legislative intention, and, 
if possible, so as to avoid an unjust or an absurd conclusion/</p>
<p>"The purpose of the sixth section, requiring the certificate, was not to 
prevent the persons named in the second article of the treaty from coming into 
the country, but to prevent Chinese laborers from entering under the guise of 
being one of the classes permitted by the treaty. It is the coming of Chinese 
laborers that the act is aimed against.</p>
<p>"It was said in the opinion in the Lau Ow Bew case, in speaking of the 
provision that the sole evidence permissible should be the certificate: 'This 
rule of evidence was evidently prescribed by the amendment as a means of 
effectually preventing the violation or evasion of the prohibition against the 
coming of Chinese laborers. It was designed as a safeguard to prevent the 
unlawful entry of such laborers, under the pretence that they belong to the 
merchant class or to some other of the admitted classes.'</p>
<p>"It was also held in that case that although the literal wording of the 
statute of 1884, section six, would require a certificate in the case of a 
merchant already domiciled in the United States and who had left the country for 
temporary purposes, <em>animo revertendi</em>, yet its true and proper 
construction did not include his case, and the general terms used in the act 
were limited to those persons to whom Congress manifestly intended to apply 
them, which would be those who were about to come to the United States for the 
first time, and not to those Chinese merchants already domiciled in the United 
States who had gone to China for temporary purposes only, with the intention of 
returning. The case of Wan Shing vs. United States (140 U. S., 424), was 
referred to, and attention called to the fact that the appellant therein was not 
a merchant but a laborer, who had acquired no commercial domicile in this 
country, and was clearly within the exception requiring him to procure and 
produce the certificate specified in the act. The ruling was approved, and the 
differences in the two cases pointed out by the Chief Justice.</p>
<p>"To hold that a certificate is required in this case is to decide that the 
woman cannot come into this country at all, for it is not possible for her to 
comply with the act, because she cannot in any event procure the certificate 
even by returning to China. She must come in as the wife of her domiciled 
husband or not at all. The act was never meant to accomplish the result of 
permanently excluding the wife under the circumstances of this case, and we 
think that, properly and reasonably construed, it does not do so. If we hold 
that she is entitled to come in as the wife, because the true construction of 
the treaty and the act permits it, there is no provision which makes the 
certificate the only proof of the fact that she is such wife.</p>
<p>"In the case of the minor children, the same result must follow as in that of 
the wife. All the reasons which favor the construction of the statute as 
exempting the wife from the necessity of procuring a certificate apply with 
equal force to the case of minor children of a member or members of the admitted 
classes. They come in by reason of their relationship to the father, and whether 
they accompany or follow him, a certificate is not necessary in either case. 
When the fact is established to the satisfaction of the authorities that the 
person claiming to enter, either as wife or minor child, is in fact the wife or 
minor child of one of the members of the class mentioned in the treaty as 
entitled to enter, then that person is entitled to admission without the 
certificate."</p></blockquote>
<p>We are not advised of any provision of Chinese law which differentiates the 
status of infant children, born out of lawful wedlock, from that of similar 
children under the laws in force in the Philippine Islands. We assume, 
therefore, that in China as well as in the Philippine Islands such children have 
the right to look to their mother for their maintenance and education, and that 
she is entitled to their custody and control in fulfilling the obligations 
towards them which are imposed upon her, not only by the natural impulses of 
love and affection, but also by the express mandate of the law. And it having 
been held on the highest authority that the general terms of the Act were 
limited to those to whom Congress manifestly intended to apply them as set forth 
in the foregoing opinion, and that "nothing is better settled than that statutes 
should receive a sensible construction, such as will effectuate the legislative 
intention, and, if possible, so as to avoid an unjust or an absurd conclusion," 
we are of opinion that the Chinese Immigration Laws should not be construed so 
as to exclude infant children of a Filipino mother, born out of lawful wedlock, 
seeking entrance to the Philippine Islands for the purpose of taking up their 
residence with her in her native land.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that such a ruling opens the door to fraud and evasion, 
but we are not much impressed with the force of this suggestion, knowing as we 
do that the immigration authorities have been furnished by the law with 
peculiarly effective machinery for its enforcement, well calculated to defeat 
any attempt to make an unauthorized or improper use of so manifestly reasonable 
an exception from the literal construction and application of its general 
provisions.</p>
<p>Some confusion seems to have arisen in the court below as to the precise 
nature and effect of the somewhat inartificial pleadings upon which these 
proceedings were submitted. The case appears to have been submitted upon an 
answer to an order to show cause why a writ of habeas corpus should not issue 
upon the petition filed on behalf of the infant children. In the form in which 
the answer is couched, there is much in the contention of the appellee that the 
trial court should have treated the answer as in substance and effect a demurrer 
to the petition, admitting the truth of the facts alleged therein, but praying 
judgment as to whether it sets forth facts sufficient to constitute a cause of 
action and to justify the issuance of the writ. We are inclined to think, 
however, that the understanding of the parties and of the court below was that 
the answer should be treated rather as in the nature of a return to a writ of 
habeas corpus, accepting as true the allegations of the petition but maintaining 
the legality of the detention upon the facts thus submitted. Without considering 
at this time whether in habeas corpus proceedings the respondent may, without 
consent of court, demur to, instead of answering an order to show cause why the 
writ should not issue, and without considering or deciding the course which 
should be pursued where a respondent attempts to file a demurrer to a petition 
for a writ of habeas corpus in lieu of the return prescribed by the statute to. 
the writ when actually issued; we treat the answer to the order to show cause in 
the case at bar as we think the parties and the court below understood it should 
be treated, that is to say, as in substance and effect the return which the 
Insular Collector desired to make to the writ of habeas corpus issued or assumed 
to have been issued in response to the petition on behalf of the children held 
in custody by him.</p>
<p>We conclude, therefore, that, it appearing that the respondent Collector of 
Customs is detaining the petitioners under an erroneous construction of the 
immigration laws, and it appearing from the facts disclosed by the 
administrative proceedings that these children are entitled to admission into 
the Philippine Islands, the order entered in the court below should be reversed, 
and in lieu thereof an order should be entered directing the discharge of these 
children from the custody of the Insular Collector of Customs, with the costs in 
both instances, <em>de officio</em>. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Moreland, Trent</em>, and <em>Araullo, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p></div>
