				<BR><STRONG>MAPA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The appellant&nbsp; was elected municipal&nbsp; president of Lipa, in&nbsp; the Province&nbsp; of Batangas, at the election held on November&nbsp; 5, 1907, without having previously&nbsp; resigned&nbsp; the office which he was holding as member&nbsp; of the local school board of the said municipality.&nbsp;&nbsp; In January, 1908, he took possession&nbsp; of the office&nbsp; of municipal president to which he&nbsp; had&nbsp; been&nbsp; elected, and in the same month the candidate defeated in that election&nbsp; filed a protest against the&nbsp; election of the appellant, on the&nbsp; ground of the latter's ineligibility on&nbsp; account&nbsp; of his&nbsp; not having resigned&nbsp; the&nbsp; said office as member of the local school board.&nbsp; The proper information having&nbsp; been&nbsp; filed, the municipal council of Lipa, in view of the result thereof, declared the said office&nbsp; of municipal president of&nbsp; Lipa to be&nbsp; vacant, which resolution was affirmed by the provincial board of Batangas and the latter designated the&nbsp; opponent,&nbsp; Guillermo Catigbac,&nbsp; to&nbsp; occupy the said office.<br><br>With these facts as a&nbsp; basis, the appellant instituted suit in the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Batangas,&nbsp; in&nbsp; which&nbsp; he demanded:<br><br>First.&nbsp; That he be declared eligible to the office of municipal president&nbsp; of Lipa,&nbsp; notwithstanding his not&nbsp; having expressly resigned the office of member of the local school board.<br><br>Second. That, therefore, the resolution of the municipal council of Lipa, declaring vacant the office of&nbsp; president of the same municipality, be declared null and void; and<br><br>Third. That the designation of Guillermo Catigbac, made by the provincial board, to occupy the said office of municipal president, be likewise annulled.<br><br>To this complaint&nbsp; the respondents filed a demurrer, and among other reasons alleged lack of jurisdiction&nbsp; of&nbsp; the court to try the case, which demurrer was admitted by the court on the&nbsp; said ground.&nbsp; The case has been forwarded to this court by virtue of the appeal filed by the petitioner against the order of the court.<br><br>Section 12&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Election Law,&nbsp; No. 1582, as amended by Act No. 1726, in its last paragraph, reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"Any councilor or other municipal officer or other person&nbsp; who&nbsp; has information that a municipal officer is ineligible shall immediately report the matter to the&nbsp; municipal council, which shall hold an investigation giving the officer opportunity&nbsp; to present&nbsp; the&nbsp; evidence in&nbsp; his&nbsp; favor.&nbsp; The council shall declare the office vacant or&nbsp; dismiss the proceedings&nbsp; as the facts may warrant.&nbsp; A&nbsp; record of the proceedings&nbsp; and&nbsp; evidence shall be kept and forwarded to the provincial board which,&nbsp; within thirty days, shall&nbsp; affirm&nbsp; or reverse the&nbsp; action of the council.<br><br>"The Governor-General, upon&nbsp; receipt of proof satisfactory to him that an ineligible&nbsp; person is holding any provincial&nbsp; or municipal office or employment,&nbsp; may summarily remove such person."</blockquote>As the appellees say in their brief, and with which we agree, the provision just quoted&nbsp; reserves to the municipal council, with the due approval of the provincial board, and also to the&nbsp; Governor-General, the power&nbsp; to remove from office any person elected as a&nbsp; municipal&nbsp; officer and who is subsequently proven to be ineligible, although he be already holding the office, and in no&nbsp; part of the&nbsp; Election Law&nbsp; is jurisdiction&nbsp; granted&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Courts of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; to review the resolution of the municipal council and the approval thereof, in such&nbsp; a case,&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; provincial board, wherein such removal is ordered.&nbsp; Such a resolution&nbsp; is final and conclusive, in the sense that it can not be reviewed by the Courts of First Instance, and is so provided by the Election Law.&nbsp; It is superfluous to add that this law, being special and exclusive&nbsp; as it is in the matter of elections,&nbsp; is the one applicable to the&nbsp; present case, rather&nbsp; than&nbsp; any other&nbsp; of a&nbsp; general character.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Sec.&nbsp; 288, Code of&nbsp; Procedure in Civil Actions.)<br><br>The order appealed from is affirmed,&nbsp; with the costs in this instance against the appellant.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i> Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson,</i> and&nbsp; <i>Carson, JJ.</i>, concur.<br></div>
