				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On the 16th of August, 1907, the plaintiffs commenced an action against the defendant to recover an amount due under a certain&nbsp; building contract.<br><br>The defendant filed an answer in which he admitted some of the facts alleged in the petition, denied others and also set up a special defense.<br><br>After hearing the evidence, the Honorable Manuel Araullo rendered a judgment in which the facts&nbsp; were set out&nbsp; in detail in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendant.<br><br>After the rendition of this judgment the plaintiffs&nbsp; made a motion for a new trial, which was granted on the 28th&nbsp; of August, 1908.<br><br>After hearing the proof in the new&nbsp; trial, the Honorable Manuel Araullo rendered&nbsp; another judgment on the 16th of February, 1909, in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendant for the sum of P2,000, and&nbsp; costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Prom this second judgment the defendant appealed and made several assignments of error in this court, some relating to questions of law and some to questions of fact.&nbsp; No motion for a new trial was made in the lower court; we can not, therefore, examine the evidence adduced on the trial of the cause.&nbsp; In the absence of a motion for a new trial, in conformity with the provisions of paragraph 3, section 497 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions,&nbsp; and an exception to the denial of the same by the trial court,&nbsp; the Supreme Court can not review the evidence and it is&nbsp; useless to include it&nbsp; in the bill of exceptions.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Prautch <i>vs.</i> Hernandez, 1 Phil.
