				<H3>SANTIAGO CODESAL AND AQUILINA OCAMPO, PLAINTIFFS AND APPELLEES, VS. ROMANA ASCUE, ADMINISTRATRIX OF THE ESTATE OF PEDRO MARTINEZ, DECEASED, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This appeal presents two questions:
<p>(1) Are the facts stated in the complaint sufficient to justify the granting 
(<em>a</em>) of a preliminary injunction; and (<em>b</em>) of a final or 
perpetual injunction?</p>
<p>(2) Are the plaintiffs and appellees the owners of the parcel of land 
described in the complaint?</p>
<p>The lower court, in a very carefully prepared opinion, answered both of said 
questions in the affirmative. From that judgment the defendant appealed and 
presented, through her assignments of error, the above questions.</p>
<p>The facts involved in the present litigation may be stated as follows:</p>
<p>(1) That some time prior to the commencement of the present action, Romana 
Ascue, as administratrix of the estate of Pedro Martinez, deceased, commenced an 
action in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, known as cause No. 
7373 against Matias Caoibes et al., to recover a sum of money;</p>
<p>(2) That in said action (No. 7373) a judgment was rendered in favor of the 
plaintiff and against the defendants, for a sum of money;</p>
<p>(3) That upon said judgment an execution was issued and placed in the hands 
of the sheriff; that the sheriff, at the direction of the plaintiff in said 
action (No. 7373) attached a certain piece or parcel of land particularly 
described in paragraph 2;</p>
<p>(4) That the plaintiffs herein being informed of said attachment, and 
alleging that they were the owners of said parcel of land, notified the sheriff 
of that fact; that said notice was given in accordance with the requirements of 
the law; that notwithstanding said notice the sheriff persisted in his 
determination to sell said parcel of land under said execution, the defendant 
herein having executed and delivered to %he sheriff the bond required by 
law.</p>
<p>Due to the persistence of the sheriff in his determination to sell said 
parcel of land under said execution, the present action was commenced for the 
purpose of enjoining him from executing said sale. The Court of First Instance 
granted a temporary injunction upon the presentation of the petition, and after 
hearing the respective parties, and after having reached the conclusion that the 
plaintiffs were the absolute owners of said parcel of land, made said temporary 
injunction final. From that judgment the defendant appealed to this court and 
presented the questions above indicated.</p>
<p>After a careful examination of the evidence, we are persuaded that a 
preponderance of the same fully sustains the conclusion of the lower court, to 
wit, that the plaintiffs are the owners in fee simple of the parcel of land in 
question. That being true, was the lower court justified in granting an 
injunction prohibiting the sale of the same, under an execution, against persons 
ether than the plaintiffs? That question seems to be so fully and completely 
answered by attorney for the appellees, by his argument and citation of 
authorities in his reply brief, that little else need be said except to add that 
section 164 of Act No. 190 amply justified the court in issuing the 
extraordinary equitable remedy of injunction when it was made to appear that the 
sheriff, under a writ of execution, was threatening to sell the property of A to 
pay the debt of B. The court was fully justified, when that question was 
presented, in granting a preliminary injunction and when the fact was fully 
established, in making the temporary injunction final. (Arbotante <em>vs</em>. 
Tan Bunjua, 21 Phil. Rep., 530, 549.)</p>
<p>A sheriff has no authority to attach the property of any person except that 
of the judgment debtor. If he does so the writ affords him no justification, for 
the act is not in obedience to the mandate of the writ of execution. (Rhodes 
<em>vs</em>. Patterson, 3 Cal, 469.)</p>
<p>An execution against the goods of A gives no authority to the sheriff to take 
the goods of B. So long as the officer confines his acts to the authority of the 
process he is not liable, but all of his acts which are not justified by the 
writ are without authority of law. The inevitable consequence, therefore, of the 
principle that no man shall touch the property of another without the permission 
of the owner or the sanction of the law, is that no plea of exemption or 
station, however exalted or consecrated, can exonerate, a trespasser. This 
principle is conservative of property. Without its integrity and universality, 
private rights would be insecure and the law would be unequal and tyrannical. 
The sovereign power of the State, with its eminent domain, cannot take from the 
humblest citizen his property for public use, without allowing him just 
compensation. If an execution against one man would excuse the sheriff for 
taking and selling the property of another, every citizen would be at his mercy 
and none could call his estate his own. (Boulware <em>vs</em>. Craddock, 30 
Cal., 190; Lammon <em>vs</em>. Feusier, 11 U. S., 17; City of Newton 
<em>vs</em>. Levis, 79 Fed..Rep., 715.)</p>
<p>A preliminary injunction maintaining the <em>status quo</em> may properly 
issue whenever the questions of law or of fact to be ultimately determined in a 
suit are grave and difficult, and injury to the moving party will be immediate, 
certain and great, if it is denied, while the loss or inconvenience to the 
opposing party will be comparatively small or insignificant if it is granted. An 
injunction may be granted when the commission or continuance of some act 
complained of during the litigation would probably work injustice, or that the 
acts complained of are in violation of the plaintiff's rights. (City of Newton 
vs. Levis, <em>supra</em>.)</p>
<p>The injunction in the present case was not an attempt to try title of real 
property, but an effort on the part of the plaintiffs to protect their rights 
under an absolute title already acquired. While it is true that the plaintiffs 
might have permitted the sheriff to have sold their property for the purpose of 
paying the debts of another and have resorted to an action upon the sheriff's 
bond, yet, in our opinion, the plaintiffs were justified in seeking the remedy 
which they obtained in the present case for the purpose of saving their 
property, and for the purpose of preventing a cloud being cast upon it.</p>
<p>From all of the foregoing, we are persuaded that the judgment of the lower 
court should be and is hereby affirmed, with costs. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Street, Malcolm, Avance√±a</em>, and <em>Fisher, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p></div>
