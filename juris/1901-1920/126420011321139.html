				<BR><STRONG>TRENT, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This  appeal involves only a right of way claimed  by the appellant Pedro P. Roxas, the owner of the dominant  estate, across parcel L, the property of  the appellee, to Calle Tejeron, a distance of about 100 meters.   The  servient estate is bounded on  the north by an estero; on the west  by the dominant estate; on the southwest by Calle Tejeron; and on the west by lands of Francisco Managan.  The eastern line, which  joins the dominant estate, is 265 meters long.  The appellant claims a right of way starting across parcel L at a point 198 meters from the southern extremity of this line. During the trial of this case  in the court below the parties entered into the following agreement:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"It is admitted as a question of fact that the road between the Hacienda de San Pedro Macati and Calle Tejeron, which, according to the witness  Leopoldo Areopaguita, was formerly  a meter and a half or two meters wide,  although at present it has a greater width, has been used from time immemorial by the tenants of the Hacienda de San Pedro Macati for the passage of carts entering and leaving the Hacienda."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to the admitted facts as above set forth, the testimony shows  that the road in question is now some  4 meters wide; that since time out of mind there has existed upon lot L near the middle,  and also very near this road, a small church; that the faithful use  said road in  going to this place of worship and that said road is not only used by the tenants of the appellant but also' by the people living in the <em>sitio</em> of Suavoy.</p>
<p>It is  admitted  by both parties that the tenants of  the dominant estate have used the road in question since time immemorial for  carts, both  for  entering and leaving  the hacienda.  It is also an established fact that  the  said  hacienda  (the dominant estate)  is partly bounded on the south by Calle Tejeron.  The point where it is claimed that this right of way  starts across lot L is only 198.25  meters from the  said street.  So the claim of the appellant cannot be that the right of way exists by necessity growing out of the . peculiar location  of his property, but  simply that  it  arises by prescription, founded alone upon immemorial use by  his tenants.</p>
<p>The result is that the road which the appellant  seeks to have declared a right of way for the benefit of his hacienda has been used for a great number of years by the members of the appellee's church to go to and from the <i>ermita</i>, and also by the appellant's tenants, and by other people.   And furthermore, while it is true that the appellant's  tenants have used this road for carts as above  stated, yet it has not been shown that such use was absolutely necessary in order to cultivate the dominant  estate,  but, on the  contrary, it clearly appears that the  said  tenants crossed lot L merely on account of convenience, as they could  have  reached the public highway by going in other directions, especially south, only 198 meters.   Therefore, the admitted and established facts show (1) that the use of the road by the tenants of the appellant in this manner and under these circumstances has not been such as to create an easement by prescription or in any other manner; and (2) that the use of said road by all has been by permission or tolerance of the appellee.</p>
<p>Where a tract of land, as in the case at bar, attached to a public meeting house—such as the <em>ermita</em>—is designedly left open and uninclosed for the convenience of the members or worshippers of that church, the mere passage of persons over  it in common with those  for whose,  use it was  appropriated is to be regarded as permissive and under  an implied license, arid  not adverse.  Such  a use is not inconsistent with  the only use which the proprietor thought fit to make of the land, and until the appellee thinks proper to inclose it, such use is not adverse and will not preclude it from enclosing the land when other views  of its interests render it proper to do so.  And though an adjacent  proprietor may make such use of the open land more frequently than another, yet the same rule will apply  unless there  be some decisive act indicating <em>a separate and exclusive use under a claim of right.&nbsp;</em>  A different doctrine would have a tendency to destroy all neighborhood accommodations in the way of travel; for  if it were once understood that a man, by allowing his neighbor to pass through his farm without objection over the pass-way which he  used  himself, would thereby, after the  lapse of time, confer  a right on such neighbor to require the pass-way to be kept open for his benefit and enjoyment, a prohibition against all such travel would  immediately ensue.  And again, it  must be remembered that a right of way, like the one sought to be established  in the  case at bar, is a charge  imposed upon real property for the benefit of another estate  belonging to a different owner.  Such a right of way is  a privilege or advantage in land existing distinct from the ownership of the soil; and because it is a permanent interest in  another's land with a right to enter at all times  and enjoy  it, it  can only be founded upon an  agreement or upon prescription. And when the latter is relied upon in those cases where the right of way is not essential for the beneficial enjoyment of the dominant estate, the proof showing adverse use—which is an  affirmative claim—must  be sufficiently strong and convincing to overcome the  presumption of permissive use or license,  as such a right  of way is never implied because it is convenient. <br></p><p>For these reasons, the judgment appealed from denying the appellant's claim  to a right  of  way  across lot  L is affirmed, with costs against the appellant.</p>

<em>Johnson </em>and<em> Moreland,  JJ.,</em> concur in the result.<br>

<em>CONCURRING</em></div>
<p><strong>TORRES, J.:</strong></p>
<p>I think that the decision should be affirmed in so far as it  orders the registration of the land,  but  with  express recognition of the right of way or road across the land, to this extent reversing the portion overruling the objection.</p>
