				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On  the 19th of February, 1904, Attorney A. Herrero, on behalf of the plaintiff, Jose Guzman, filed a complaint with the  Court of First  Instance of Manila against the captain and owners of the steamer  Kudat, alleging that in the early part of January of said year an agent of the plaintiff contracted with Behn,  Meyer &amp; Co., agents of the  said steamer,  in the sum of  P150,  for the towing of the  lorcha <em>Nevada</em>, owned by the plaintiff, to the  port of Iloilo.  That on the 4th  day of  the month aforesaid the captain of the  steamer <em>Kudat</em> took charge of the  lorcha, which was manned by a master and four sailors,  and on the  following day, the 5th, at  noon, the steamer left the port of Manila with the lorcha in tow;  that at about 9.30 p. m. of the same date, as the <em>Kudat</em> with her tow was within sight of the Island of Cabras, between Luzon and the Island of Mindoro,  the port tow line broke, and that thereupon the captain of the <em>Kudat</em> ordered the crew of the Nevada as  the latter neared the  stern of the steamer to come on board  the <em>Kudat</em> and to abandon the lorcha; that as the master  (<em>arraez</em>) protested several times against such order, the captain insisted and threatened to cut the other tow line; that in consequence of the attitude of the captain the crew abandoned the  lorcha and boarded  the steamer and the captain  then  ordered  the  abandonment of the lorcha and  cast her adrift by having the tow line cut,  and the steamer then proceeded  on her voyage  to Iloilo.</p>
<p>It further appears that upon arriving at the latter port on the 7th day  of  the said month the master or pilot of the lorcha went to the  collector  of customs and entered a protest, in which he stated that the weather was fair, the sea calm, that the moon was bright, and that the spot where one of the tow lines broke was close to the Islands of  Mindoro, Cabras,  and  Luban, at any of which places the lorcha might  have been left in safety.   The captain of  the <em>Kudat</em> did  not enter any protest at Iloilo  in order to  justify the abandonment of the lorcha  nor the circumstances connected therewith.  The abandonment  was  evidently  due to  carelessness  and unpardonable negligence because there was no <em>force majeure </em>nor any like reason to justify  the nonfulfillment  of his duty to tow the lorcha to
the port of Iloilo.</p>
<p>For the foregoing reasons the plaintiff asked that, after due process of law, judgment  be  entered sentencing  the owners and captain of the steamer <em>Kudat</em> to pay  him  the sum of  P49,000 as indemnity for damages  suffered for the abandonment of the lorcha <em>Nevada</em>, and to pay the costs of  the proceedings, together with any  other  relief which the court might consider just and equitable.</p>
<p>It does not appear that the captain,  William X, of  the <em>Kudat</em>,  was ever summoned to appear before the court,  but Behn, Meyer &amp; Co. were, and on the 23d of March of said year said firm, in answer to the complaint,  denied each and all of  the allegations therein contained.</p>
<p>Upon evidence being adduced by  the plaintiff, the  defendant moved  for the dismissal of  the case,  and as  the motion  was overruled by the court the  defendant  firm  excepted thereto and afterwards produced  its  evidence, which was made of record.  On the 19th of  October judgment was rendered sentencing the defendants, Behn, Meyer &amp; Co., to  pay the plaintiff herein the sum  of 9,000 pesos, Philippine  currency,  and  costs.  The judgment  was  excepted to by  the defendant firm, who  moved for a new trial on the ground that the decision was contrary to law and to the weight of the evidence, and because the findings of fact of the judgment are contrary to  the preponderance of the proofs.  This  motion was overruled and  the  defendant duly exeepted thereto.</p>
<p>The contract entered  into between the agent  of Jose (luzman, owner of the lorcha <em>Nevada</em>, and the firm of Behn, Meyer &amp; Co., as agents and representatives of the  captain and owners of the steamer <em>Kudat</em>, is not a charter party. It is a contract for the hire of services by virtue  of which the  said firm, by means  of the  said  steamer, under the management of its captain, officers, and crew, engaged  to tow the said  lorcha from this port of Manila to that  of Iloilo for  a  consideration  of P150.   The provisions  of articles 652 <em>et seq</em>. of the Code of Commerce with reference to charter parties are not applicable  in  this case because the lorcha was not shipped or placed on board the steamer, but, as had been agreed to, should have been towed from this port to Iloilo.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the fact that the defendant has denied the making of the said contract, its existence is unquestionable, as proven by Exhibit E on page 12 of the record, this document not having been objected to or impugned by the defendant.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding  the fact that the  agreement entered into by the agent of the steamer <em>Kudat</em> was to tow the said lorcha from the port of Manila to that of Iloilo, the truth of the matter  is that the captain of the <em>Kudat</em> took charge of the lorcha  on the 4th of January, 1904, and sailed at noon of the following day,  and when  the  steamer was within sight of the Island of Cabras, between the Islands of Luzon and  Mindoro, at about 9.30 p.  m. of the 5th, on account of the breaking of  the port tow line, he ordered that by means of the starboard line the lorcha be brought to the stern of the steamer.  After compelling the  crew of the lorcha to board the steamer, the captain then ordered the steel tow line cut, and the lorcha was thus abandoned entirely.  As  the lorcha was lost sight of and became  a total loss, she  was not  towed to nor did she ever reach the port of Iloilo, as had  been stipulated between her owner and the firm of Behn, Meyer &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Articles 1101 and 1601 of the Civil Code provide thatâ€” </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Those who in fulfilling their obligations are guilty of fraud, negligence, or delay, and those who in any manner whatsoever act in contravention  of the stipulations  of the same, shall be subject to indemnify for the losses and damages caused thereby".   (Art. 1101.)</p>
  <p>"Carriers of goods by land or by water shall be subject, with regard to the keeping and preservation of the things intrusted to them, to the same obligations  as determined for innkeepers by articles seventeen hundred and eighty-three and seventeen  hundred and eighty-four.</p>
  <p>"The provisions of this article shall be understood without prejudice to what is  prescribed by the  Code of Commerce with regard  to transportation  by sea and  land." (Art. 1601.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It can not be doubted that the captain who commanded the steamer <em>Kudat</em> failed to comply with the contract for towage and acted  in contravention of what  had been stipulated therein between the owner of the lorcha in tow and the agents who represented the owners of the steamer, and when  abandoning the lorcha in  mid-ocean with the full knowledge that it would disappear and  become a loss, he acted with  marked negligence and a perfect knowledge of the loss and damage he was about to cause the owner. Therefore,  pursuant  to the provisions of law above quoted, the owner  of the lorcha must be indemnified, the contract of towage  involving the  obligation to  use  due diligence (art. 1104) the omission of which would imply fault or negligence on the  part of the obligee,  because the lorcha <em>Nevada</em> was abandoned with  the intent of casting her adrift to become a total loss.</p>
<p>The record  does not show that <em>force majeure</em> or  other such  casualty  intervened  to cause the loss  of the lorcha in tow.   Eather to the contrary, as from  the evidence adduced at the trial it is inferred that there  was not only negligence  but a willful intent to cause the total loss of the lorcha, without  any  reason whatever which  required its abandonment at the time.  It should be noted, however, that the duty  to prove or  show the reasons for exemption from  liability rests  with the defendant, Avho thereupon bases his exception.</p>
<p>Article 624  of the  Code of Commerce imposes on a captain, in case he has been wrecked or the cargo of his vessel damaged, the  duty of making  the corresponding protest before the  proper  authority at the first  port where the vessel touches,  within the  twenty-four  hours  following his arrival.</p>
<p>The captain of the <em>Kudat</em> did not make any  protest before any officer or competent authority  at Iloilo stating the reasons which compelled him to  abandon the lorcha. On the other hand, the master or <em>patron</em> of the lost lorcha complied  with this duty imposed  by law and  appeared before the collector of customs of Iloilo and set forth his protest in duplicate,  as  per documents marked with the letters "A" and "F," wherein, upon request of the  <em>patron</em>, a statement of what had occurred was inscribed.  Articles 586 and 587 of the Code of  Commerce provide thatâ€”</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The owner of a vessel and the agent shall be civilly liable for the acts of the captain and for the obligations contracted by the latter to repair, equip, and provision the vessel, provided  the  creditor  proves that  the  amount claimed was invested therein.</p>
  <p>"By agent is understood the person intrusted with the provisioning of a vessel or who represents her in the port in which she happens to be."  (Art. 586.)</p>
  <p>"The agent shall also be civilly liable for the indemnities in favor of third persons which arise from the conduct of the captain in the care of  the  goods which the vessel carried; but he may exempt himself therefrom by abandoning the vessel with all her equipments and the freight he may have earned  during  the trip."  (Art. 587.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The firm of Behn, Meyer &amp; Co. contracted for the  towage or conveyance by sea of the lorcha <em>Nevada</em> from Manila to Iloilo, undoubtedly in their capacity of agents, charged by the owners of  the steamer <em>Kudat</em> to represent them in this port of Manila,  According to the provisions of the two foregoing  articles of the Code of Commerce, therefore, the aforesaid  firm is  the  only party  bound to indemnify the owner  of  the <em>Nevada</em> in  the amount of the damages sustained  by  him through the loss  of the  above-mentioned lorcha, considering the  negligent,  not to say criminal, action of the captain, Avho, without any cause or reason and without any unforeseen accident or stress of weather, willfully abandoned the lorcha, well knowing that it would be lost, as really happened.</p>
<p>Behn, Meyer &amp; Co. were unable to deny  the existence of said contract  of towage, and, as a matter of fact,  they actually tried to recover the amount of the consideration for such service which had not been rendered by the steamer KmUit, for which they were agents.  The  court, in the judgment appealed from, having considered the amount of the indemnity to be paid to the plaintiff, who, on his part, has consented  thereto  notwithstanding that in his complaint he claimed a larger amount, it is proper to affirm the same.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, and accepting those conclusions of the judgment appealed from which are in accordance with this decision, said judgment  is hereby affirmed, with the costs against the appellants.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Johnson, Willard,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
