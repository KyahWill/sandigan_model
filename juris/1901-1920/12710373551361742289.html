				<BR><STRONG>MORELAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of the Province of Iloilo, Hon. J. S. Powell, presiding, convicting&nbsp; the accused&nbsp; of the crime of <i>estupro </i>and sentencing him&nbsp; to four months of <i>arresto mayor,</i> with the accessories&nbsp; incident to that penalty, and' to pay&nbsp; to the offended woman, by way of indemnification, the sum of P500, to&nbsp; suffer subsidiary&nbsp; imprisonment in&nbsp; case of insolvency, and to pay the costs.<br><br>The girl seduced in this case, Alejandra Lumanpao, testified that for about a year prior to the commission of the crime&nbsp; in&nbsp; question the accused had been trying&nbsp; to&nbsp; induce her to&nbsp; permit him&nbsp; to have sexual intercourse with&nbsp; her; that she opposed his purposes, insisting that,&nbsp; before&nbsp; such a thing could happen, they must be married; that the accused, finally understanding&nbsp; that his efforts were entirely useless, conducted her to the house&nbsp; of his brother, a notary public,&nbsp; who, on the&nbsp; 27th of October,&nbsp; 1909, performed a fictitious marriage ceremony between them in the presence of witnesses, and delivered to the girl a certificate of marriage ; that that night the two cohabited together as husband and wife; that&nbsp; under the pretext&nbsp; that there had been a mistake in making out the certificate of marriage he obtained possession thereof&nbsp; and thereafter destroyed it;&nbsp; that on&nbsp; the&nbsp; night of the following day the&nbsp; accused&nbsp; came to her and there occurred between them&nbsp; a dispute&nbsp; over the marriage certificate; that&nbsp; thereafter she went to the house of the accused and told&nbsp; him that she did not wish to be his<i> querida</i> but desired to be married to him; that on&nbsp; asking him why he had deceived her in the way that he had, the accused&nbsp; answered that it was because she had refused to accede to his desires.<br><br>The&nbsp; prosecution presented&nbsp; as a witness in corroboration of the testimony of Alejandra, one Eliseo Veneer, who&nbsp; was present during the said marriage ceremony and who signed the certificate as a witness.<br><br>The&nbsp; testimony of the accused consisted in a denial that said marriage ceremony had&nbsp; ever taken place and that he had ever had carnal intercourse with the <i>denunciante.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; In corroboration, he presented as a witness&nbsp; his brother,&nbsp; the notary public who was alleged to have performed the mariage&nbsp; ceremony, who declared positively that he had never performed&nbsp; such marriage ceremony.&nbsp;&nbsp; He&nbsp; presented&nbsp; also another witness to the effect that he was in company with the notary public during the whole day on which the marriage&nbsp; ceremony is said to have taken place and that&nbsp; he, the&nbsp; said notary public,&nbsp; performed no&nbsp; such ceremony on said day.<br><br>It is thus seen that the only question&nbsp; presented&nbsp; is one of fact.&nbsp;&nbsp; The learned trial court, before whom the witnesses testified,&nbsp; accepted the testimony&nbsp; of the witnesses for the prosecution in preference to that of the&nbsp; defense.&nbsp; He gives his reasons for&nbsp; so doing very fully and clearly and presents an opinion in support of his conclusions&nbsp; which is extremely full and satisfactory.&nbsp; In that opinion he says:<br><blockquote>"This girl, Alejandra, who&nbsp; is&nbsp; barely able to write her name,&nbsp; and of a lower stratum of society than this defendant and his&nbsp; family, could not possibly&nbsp; have made&nbsp; up the story that she told in this court in all of its details.&nbsp;&nbsp; She could not have been taught this story in all its details and undergone the examination that she did and not have broken down."<br></blockquote>The question&nbsp; being&nbsp; one of fact, involving primarily the relative credibility of witnesses, the doctrine laid down in the case of The United States <i>vs.</i> Ambrosio (17 Phil. Rep., 295) is applicable.&nbsp; In that case we said:<br><blockquote>"The trial court in the opinion upon which its judgment of conviction is founded went into the facts in detail.&nbsp; He analyzed the testimony carefully and gave his reasons for believing&nbsp; the story told&nbsp; by the witnesses for the prosecution rather than that told by the witnesses for the defendants.&nbsp;&nbsp; He saw the witnesses in the act&nbsp; of testifying.&nbsp; He observed&nbsp; carefully&nbsp; their&nbsp; manner upon the witness stand. He studied every detail&nbsp; for the express purpose&nbsp; of determining where credibility lay.&nbsp; We do not feel like interfering with the intelligent conclusions of the court concerning the credibility of witnesses unless the record discloses that some fact or circumstance of weight or influence was overlooked&nbsp; by the court or&nbsp; was&nbsp; misapprehended or misinterpreted."<br></blockquote>For these reasons the judgment is&nbsp; hereby&nbsp; affirmed, with costs against&nbsp; the appellant.<br><br><i>Arellano,&nbsp; C. J., Mapa, Carson, </i>and <i> Trent, JJ.</i>, concur.<br></div>
