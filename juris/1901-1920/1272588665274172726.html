				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; was charged with&nbsp; the crime&nbsp; of&nbsp; assault upon agents of the authorities and insulting them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon said complaint the defendant was arrested, arraigned, tried, found&nbsp; guilty, and sentenced&nbsp; by&nbsp; the Honorable&nbsp; Vicente Nepomuceno to be imprisoned for a&nbsp; period of&nbsp; four years two months and one&nbsp; day of&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correccional</span>, with the accessory penalties of article 61 of the Penal Code, to pay a fine of P300, and in case of insolvency to suffer&nbsp; subsidiary imprisonment, in accordance&nbsp; with the provisions of the law, and to pay the costs.&nbsp; From that sentence the&nbsp; defendant appealed to this court.<br><br>In this court the&nbsp; appellant&nbsp; alleges that&nbsp; the evidence adduced during&nbsp; the trial of the cause&nbsp; was&nbsp; not sufficient to show that&nbsp; he was guilty of&nbsp; the crime&nbsp; charged in the complaint.<br><br>The record&nbsp; shows that some time in the month of November, 1914,&nbsp; an order of arrest was issued for the defendant and placed in the hands of the chief of police of the municipality of Gerona.&nbsp;&nbsp; On or about the 15th of November, the chief of&nbsp; police,&nbsp; accompanied by&nbsp; another policeman, went to the house where the defendant was staying for the purpose of making the arrest.&nbsp; Upon&nbsp; arrival at the house, inquiry was made of some of the occupants whether or not the defendant was there.&nbsp; Upon being informed that he was in the house, the policeman&nbsp; who&nbsp; accompanied the chief&nbsp; of police entered the house without&nbsp; permission and attempted to&nbsp; arrest the&nbsp; defendant without explaining to him the cause&nbsp; or nature of his presence there.&nbsp; The defendant, according to the declaration of the chief&nbsp; of police, resisted the arrest, calling to his neighbors for assistance, using the following language: "Come here; there are some bandits here&nbsp; and they are abusing&nbsp; me."&nbsp; Many&nbsp; of his neighbors, hearing his cry,&nbsp; according to the testimony of the chief of police, immediately came to his assistance and surrounded&nbsp; his house.<br><br>The policeman, who accompanied the chief, in his declaration said that&nbsp; when he attempted to arrest the defendant, the defendant&nbsp; said to him: "Why do you enter my house, you shameless&nbsp; brigands?" and called to one&nbsp; Basilio, saying: "There are&nbsp; some bandits here!"<br><br>The policeman further testified that he then informed the defendant&nbsp; that he came there for the purpose of arresting him, and the defendant&nbsp; asked him if he had an order of arrest, which question&nbsp; was answered&nbsp; by the policeman in the affirmative.&nbsp; Said policeman further testified&nbsp; that immediately after he had notified the defendant that he was a policeman and had an&nbsp; order of arrest,&nbsp; the defendant submitted to&nbsp; the arrest without further resistance&nbsp; or objection.<br><br>The whole record shows that the resistance given by the defendant was done under the belief that the persons&nbsp; who had entered his house were <span style="font-style: italic;">tulisanes</span>.&nbsp; The record&nbsp; also shows, by the declaration&nbsp; of the witnesses for the prosecution, that as soon as he had been informed that they were officers of the law, armed with an order of arrest, he peaceably submitted and&nbsp; accompanied them.&nbsp; We do not believe that the law contemplates the punishment of persons for resistance of the authorities under circumstances such as those which are disclosed in the present case.&nbsp; If&nbsp; the defendant believed that those who had entered his house were, in fact,&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">tulisanes</span>, he was entirely justified in calling his neighbors and in making an attempt to expel them from his premises.<br><br>After&nbsp; a careful examination of the evidence, we&nbsp; are of the opinion&nbsp; that the record does not disclose sufficient facts to justify the sentence imposed by. the lower court.&nbsp; The defendant is not guilty of the crime described in the complaint.&nbsp; The sentence of the lower court is therefore hereby revoked, the complaint is hereby&nbsp; ordered&nbsp; dismissed, and the defendant is discharged from the custody of the law. So ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano,&nbsp; C. J., Torres,&nbsp; Carson, Trent, </i>and <i>Araullo, JJ.,</i> concur.<br></div>
