				<H3>ELENA MORENTE, PETITIONER AND APPELLANT, VS. GUMERSINDO DE LA SANTA, RESPONDENT AND APPELLEE.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The will of Consuelo Morente contains  the following clauses:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"1.  I hereby order that all real estate which may belong to me shall pass to my husband, Gumersihdo de la Santa.</p>
  <p>"2.  That my  said husband shall not leave my  brothers after my death, and that he shall not marry anyone; should my said  husband have children by anyone, he shall  not convey any portion of the property left by me, except the one-third part thereof and the two remaining thirds shall be  and remain  for  my brother Vicente or his children should he have any.</p>
  <p>"3. After my death I direct my husband to dwell in the <em>camarin</em> in which the bakery  is located, which is one of the properties belonging to me."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Her husband, Gumersindo de la Santa, married again within  four months  of the death of the testatrix.  Elena Morente,  a  .sister  of  the deceased, filed  a petition in  the proceeding relating to the probate of the will of Consuelo Morente pending  in  the  Court of First Instance of  the Province of Tayabas  in which she alleged the second marriage of Gumersindo de la Santa and asked that the legacy to him above mentioned be annulled.  Objection, was made in the court below by the husband to the procedure followed by  the petitioner.  The court  below,  however,  held that the proceeding was proper and from that holding the husband did not appeal.   From  the judgment of the court below, the petitioner, Elena Morente, appealed.</p>
<p>In its judgment the court denied the  petition.  It was said, however, in the decision, as we understand it, that the husband having married, he had the right to the use of all of the property during  his life and that at his  death two-thirds thereof would pass to  Vicente, a brother of the testatrix, and  one-third thereof could be disposed of by  the husband.  The construction given to the will by the court below is not accepted by  the appellant.   She claims that by the mere act of marriage the husband at once lost all rights acquired  by the will.  It is  neither alleged nor proven  that any children have been born to the husband since the death of the testatrix.</p>
<p>Article 790 of the Civil Code provides that testamentary provisions may be made conditional and article t93 provides that a prohibition against another marriage may in certain cases be validly imposed upon the widow  or widower.  But  the question in this case is, Did  the testatrix intend to impose a condition  upon the absolute gift which is contained in the first clauses of the will?  It is to be observed that by the second clause she directs  that her husband shall not leave her sisters.   It is provided in the third clause that he must continue to live in a certain building. It is provided in the second clause that he shall not marry again.  To no one of these orders is attached the condition that if he fails to comply with them he shall lose the legacy given to him by the first clause of the will.  It is nowhere expressly said that if he does leave the testatrix's sisters, or does not continue to dwell in the building mentioned in the will he shall forfeit the  property given him  in the first clause; nor is it anywhere expressly said that if he marries again he shall incur such a loss.  But it is expressly provided that if one event does happen the disposition of the property contained in the first clause of the will shall be changed.   It is said that if lie has children by anyone, two-thirds of that property shall pass to Vicente,  the brother of the testatrix.</p>
<p>We are bound to construe the  will with reference to all the clauses contained therein, and with reference to such surrounding circumstances as duly appear in the case, and after such consideration  we can  not say that it was the intention of the testatrix that if her husband married again he should forfeit the legacy above mentioned.  In  other words, there being no express condition  attached to that legacy in reference to the second  marriage, we  can not say that any condition can be implied from the context of the will.  In the case of Ohiong Joc-Soy vs. Jaime Va√±o (8 Phil.  Rep., 119), we held  that the legacy contained  in the will  therein mentioned was not  conditional.   It is  true that that case arose under article 797 of the  Oivil Code, which perhaps is not strictly applicable to this case, but we think that it may be argued from what is said  in article 797 that, in order to make a testamentary provision  conditional, such condition must fairly appear from the language used in the will.</p>
<p>Whether the children mentioned in the second clause of the will are natural children or legitimate children  we do not decide,  for no such question  is  before us,  the contingency mentioned in  that part of the clause  not having arisen, and we limit ourselves to saying merely that by the subsequent marriage of the husband he did not forfeit the legacy given to him by the first part of the will.  That was the only  question before the court below.  The judgment of that court, denying the petition, is accordingly affirmed, with the  v.otita of this instance against the appellant.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano,  C. J., Torres, Mapa,  Johnson,  Carson,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
