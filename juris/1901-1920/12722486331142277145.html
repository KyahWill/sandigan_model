				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In&nbsp; this case, which appears to be in the nature of a test case,&nbsp; there is no contention as to the facts, which are definitely and comprehensively stipulated, and&nbsp; the only question submitted for our consideration is whether, under the facts&nbsp; thus stipulated,&nbsp; defendant and&nbsp; appellee,&nbsp; who is&nbsp; a Chinese person, apprehended&nbsp; under the provisions&nbsp; of Act No. 702, is a "merchant" and was a "merchant" during the period of registration prescribed&nbsp; in that Act, as that term is defined therein.<br><br>Section 12 of Act No. 702 of the Philippine Commission provides that:<br><blockquote>"The term 'merchant' as employed in this Act signifies a person&nbsp; engaged in buying and selling merchandise at&nbsp; a fixed&nbsp; place of business,&nbsp; which business is conducted in his name, and who during the time&nbsp; he claims&nbsp; to be engaged as a merchant does not engage in the performance&nbsp; of any manual labor except such as is necessary in&nbsp; the conduct of his business as such merchant.&nbsp; The definition of 'laborer' and 'merchant' set out in this section shall receive the same construction as that given to it by the Federal courts of the United States and the rulings&nbsp; and&nbsp; regulations&nbsp; of the Treasury Department of the United States."<br></blockquote>This definition is taken bodily from the provisions of the Chinese-exclusion laws&nbsp; enacted&nbsp; by Congress which were extended to the island territory of the United States;&nbsp; and the Philippine Commission, upon which was imposed the duty of enforcing the laws thus extended to these Islands, properly refrained from any attempt to modify or to&nbsp; change the requisites of the definition laid down by Congress, and took&nbsp; care&nbsp; to&nbsp; provide&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; terms&nbsp; "merchant" and "laborer" as used in the Act should have the same meaning as that given to them by the Federal courts of the United States,&nbsp; thus eliminating any possibility that, influenced by local law, the meaning given these terms should in any wise affect the uniformity of application and administration of the Chinese-exclusion laws in the&nbsp; United States and the Philippines.<br><br>The facts as stipulated by counsel are as&nbsp; follows:<br><ol><li>Tan Sam Tao, the defendant,&nbsp; is a Chinaman, 38 years of age, who has been in the Philippines for the past twenty-four years.<br><br></li><li>On June 15,&nbsp; 1909, an&nbsp; officer&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Manila&nbsp; customhouse demanded of the said Tan Sam Tao that&nbsp; he&nbsp; exhibit his certificate as a Chinese resident in the Philippines, and the said. Tan Sam Tao declined and refused to&nbsp; exhibit it, and in consequence thereof was arrested by the said officer and brought before this court, where the complaint in this case was filed against him requesting the deportation of the said Tan Sam Tao&nbsp; from these Islands.<br><br></li><li>The said Tan Sam Tao&nbsp; justifies his sojourn&nbsp; in the Philippines by alleging that he is a merchant, as&nbsp; defined by the Act of Congress for the&nbsp; exclusion of Chinese from the territory of the United States, which claim&nbsp; is disputed by the officers charged&nbsp; with administration of&nbsp; the&nbsp; provisions of the said Act in the Philippines.<br><br></li><li>The said Tan&nbsp; Sam Tao is at the present time, and has been for more than ten years, a member of a firm&nbsp; having a fixed&nbsp; place of business,&nbsp; to wit, No. 27&nbsp; calle Nueva, Binondo, Manila.<br><br></li><li>The said Tan Sam Tao is interested&nbsp; to the extent of P11,100&nbsp; of the&nbsp; capital&nbsp; of P40,900 invested&nbsp; in the&nbsp; said business among the six members, in the following manner:</li></ol><table width="75%" border="0" align="center"> <tbody><tr> <td width="82%">Tan Sam&nbsp;&nbsp; Tao..........................................................................</td> <td width="18%">P11,100</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Tan&nbsp;&nbsp; Sara&nbsp;&nbsp; Chian.......................................................................&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td> <td> 9,500</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Tan Se&nbsp;&nbsp; Ken...........................................................................&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td> <td>6,600</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Tan Bu&nbsp;&nbsp; Ay.............................................................................&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td> <td>4,500</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Ching Suy&nbsp;&nbsp; Hong.....................................................................&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td> <td>5,200</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Tan Sam&nbsp;&nbsp; Juan.......................................................................&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td> <td>4,000</td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><ol start="6"><li>&nbsp;The said Tan Sam Tao can prove these facts by two competent witnesses who do not belong to the Chinese race.<br><br></li><li>Proof of the existence of the said firm, composed of the six members aforesaid, appears&nbsp; in the articles of incorporation, wherein&nbsp; it is set forth that the defendant is the owner of his&nbsp; share in his own name, and the same facts are to be found in the books of the firm.<br><br></li><li>The said business consists of the purchase and sale to the public,&nbsp; by wholesale and retail, of textiles, under the firm name of "Jap Jin," sometimes called&nbsp; "Jap Jin &amp; Co.," which, translated into English, means "United for prosperity."<br><br></li><li>The&nbsp; said Tan Sam&nbsp; Tao does not do&nbsp; nor has he done other manual labor than what is or was necessary in the said business to which he devotes himself exclusively.<br><br></li><li>Neither the said Tan Sam Tao&nbsp; nor&nbsp; his firm are registered in the&nbsp; Mercantile Register, nor in the Bureau of Internal&nbsp; Revenue, but the&nbsp; license for the said&nbsp; business, issued by the Collector of Internal Revenue, is in the name of one of the other members of the said firm.<br><br></li><li>The&nbsp; said business is&nbsp; established and carried&nbsp; on in accordance&nbsp; with the&nbsp; Chinese customs, the articles of incorporation being drawn up and the&nbsp; bookkeeping done in the Chinese language.</li></ol>From the facts thus stipulated, there can&nbsp; be no&nbsp; doubt that appellee is in fact a merchant, but the&nbsp; question submitted is whether from these facts he can be said to have conducted his business in his own name, so as to bring him under the definition of the term "merchant" as above set out.<br><br>This precise question was submitted and&nbsp; decided upon an&nbsp; agreed&nbsp; statement&nbsp; of facts&nbsp; substantially similar to the stipulation of&nbsp; facts above set out,&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Circuit&nbsp; Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (Lee Kan <i>vs.</i> U. S., 10 C. C. A., 669; 15 U. S. App., 516;&nbsp; 62 Fed., 914) in an opinion delivered by Mr. Justice McKenna, then circuit judge, which was cited with approval by the&nbsp; Supreme Court of&nbsp; the United States in the cases of Tom Hong, Tom&nbsp; Dock and Lee Kit<i> vs.</i> U. S. (193 U. S., 517, 518), and&nbsp; in which, as observed by Justice Day in the latter cases,&nbsp; "the subject was so fully&nbsp; considered as to leave little to&nbsp; be&nbsp; added to the discussion."<br><br>From this opinion&nbsp; we quote at length:<br><blockquote>"To ascertain the&nbsp; meaning of Congress, the purpose of the Act as well as the language must be considered.&nbsp; The provisions of section 2, supra, are amendments to the Act of May 5, 1892, commonly called the 'Geary Act,' and they and the Act they amend are but steps in legislation to regulate and restrict the coming of Chinese laborers into the United States, and all provisions in regard to other classes are but means to that end.&nbsp; In interpreting' that legislation, this purpose has been steadily regarded, as by well-known canons of interpretation&nbsp; it must have been regarded, and the general language of the Acts confined to executing this purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>In re</i> Low Yam Chow, 13 Fed., 605.)&nbsp;&nbsp; The sanction&nbsp; of these Acts is the treaty of November,&nbsp; 1880, modifying that of 1868, except the Scott law, which, to its extent, abrogated the treaty; but this also was no exception to&nbsp; the purpose of the legislation, to wit,&nbsp; the exclusion&nbsp; of laborers.&nbsp; Besides, it was expressed in terms so irresistibly clear as&nbsp; to&nbsp; leave&nbsp; interpretation&nbsp; no&nbsp; function.&nbsp; The&nbsp; first article of the treaty of November,&nbsp; 1880, provides that 'the Government&nbsp; of&nbsp; the United States&nbsp; may&nbsp; regulate,&nbsp; limit,&nbsp; or suspend the coming or residence of Chinese laborers to the United States, but may not absolutely prohibit it;' but the treaty also provides 'that&nbsp; the limitation or suspension shall be&nbsp; reasonable, and shall&nbsp; apply&nbsp; only to&nbsp; Chinese&nbsp; who&nbsp; may go&nbsp; to the&nbsp; United States&nbsp; as laborers, other classes not being included&nbsp; in the limitation.'&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, in the second article it&nbsp; is declared&nbsp; that 'Chinese subjects, whether&nbsp; proceeding to the United&nbsp; States as teachers, students, merchants, or from curiosity, together with their body or house-hold servants, and Chinese laborers who&nbsp; are&nbsp; now in the United States, shall be allowed to go and come of their own free will and&nbsp; accord,&nbsp; and shall be accorded all the rights, privileges, immunities, and exemptions which are accorded to the citizens and&nbsp; objects of the most favored&nbsp; nations.' The first Act after this treaty was that of May 6, 1882.&nbsp; It prohibited the coming&nbsp; of Chinese laborers for ten years, and contained provisions to secure the prohibition.&nbsp;&nbsp; Among others, it provided, in section 6, that the identity of 'every Chinese person&nbsp; other than&nbsp; a laborer should be evidenced by a certificate&nbsp; issued under the authority of the Chinese Government.'&nbsp;&nbsp; This Act came up for consideration&nbsp; before Justice Field, in the case of <i>In re</i> Low Yam Chow,<i> supra,</i> and he held that the 'section was&nbsp; evidently designed&nbsp; to facilitate proof by Chinese, other than laborers coming from China, and&nbsp; desiring to enter&nbsp; the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; * It is not required as a&nbsp; means&nbsp; of restricting&nbsp; their coming. To hold that such was its object would be to impute to Congress a purpose to disregard&nbsp; the stipulation&nbsp; of the second article of the new treaty that they should be allowed to go and come of their own&nbsp; free will and accord.'&nbsp; The learned justice also&nbsp; says:<br><br>" 'And we will not assume, in the absence of plain language to the contrary, that Congress intended to disregard the obligation of the original treaty of 1868, which remains in full force except as modified by the supplementary treaty of 1880.'<br><br>"This case and its language were approved by the United States Supreme&nbsp; Court in Lau Ow Bew <i>vs.</i> U. S. (144 U. S., 59, 12 Sup.&nbsp; Ct.,&nbsp; 517), and other cases were there&nbsp; collected and commented&nbsp; on which sustain its&nbsp; principle.&nbsp; There&nbsp; is nothing in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Geary and the McCreary&nbsp; Acts which excludes&nbsp; them from the&nbsp; doctrine of these cases, or in any way includes merchants in&nbsp; the limitations or prohibitions on immigration.&nbsp; That we&nbsp; are right in this case is sustained by the explanation made by Mr. Geary in the House of Representatives when the McCreary bill was under consideration.&nbsp; The provisions of section 2, supra,&nbsp; were not contained in the bill reported by the&nbsp; Committee on Foreign Affairs.&nbsp;&nbsp; They were moved as amendments by Mr. Geary, and in explanation of them he said:<br><br>" 'There is one other definition that we think necessary. The treaty permits "merchants" to come into this country. We have no desire to restrict the movements of the mercantile class; but the trouble has been that men pretending to be merchants have asked&nbsp; for admission&nbsp; at New&nbsp; York and&nbsp; other&nbsp; places, have&nbsp; sworn&nbsp; that&nbsp; they&nbsp; had interest in stores established in those communities, have been admitted as merchants,&nbsp; and immediately developed&nbsp; into full-fledged laborers.&nbsp; We&nbsp; merely ask&nbsp; for a definition of the&nbsp; word "merchant" which shall&nbsp; be&nbsp; broad enough to protect every man&nbsp; legitimately&nbsp; engaged&nbsp; in&nbsp; that industry, and narrow enough to prevent the designation being used as an instrument of&nbsp; fraud by a class&nbsp; that we&nbsp; do not desire.&nbsp; This amendment&nbsp; requires every Chinaman asking to&nbsp; be admitted&nbsp; into the United&nbsp; States, and&nbsp; who&nbsp; claims&nbsp; to&nbsp; have formerly resided here, to prove that for at least one&nbsp; year, at some fixed place of business within&nbsp; the Union, he was engaged in buying and&nbsp; selling merchandise. We&nbsp; do not demand that he shall have&nbsp; a dollar's&nbsp; worth of stock, or a thousand dollars'&nbsp; worth; we&nbsp; simply&nbsp; follow&nbsp; the language of the&nbsp; treaty,&nbsp; and&nbsp; demand this&nbsp; protection&nbsp; to our own people.'<br><br>"How efficient the amendment is for the purposes declared by Mr. Geary we shall hereafter&nbsp; show. It is incontestable that it was not directed at merchants&nbsp; any more than prior legislation was, or that it was&nbsp; not intended to regulate their methods of business, except so far as necessary to prevent evasions of the Act.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was directed&nbsp; at laborers - to prevent&nbsp; them&nbsp; from assuming a false&nbsp; character.&nbsp;&nbsp; To construe it otherwise is to make merchants its primary objects and subject them to a&nbsp; discrimination and inconvenience within&nbsp; the country to which no other merchants are subjected.&nbsp; It would not only forbid them to do business as it is their custom to do, but to do business as it&nbsp; is the custom of all commercial people to do. It is&nbsp; stipulated in this case that the designation of the firm of which petitioner is a member was&nbsp; selected in&nbsp; accordance with a custom which has prevailed&nbsp; from time immemorial among the Chinese, and expresses a propitious&nbsp; omen, and means, when&nbsp; literally rendered in English, 'everlasting,'&nbsp; 'great,' 'bountiful.'&nbsp;&nbsp; But, as stated by counsel, the custom is not exclusive with&nbsp; Chinese.&nbsp; It prevails&nbsp; with&nbsp; other&nbsp; people, and the Bon Marche of Paris, and the Golden Rule Bazaar of this city were cited, among others, as examples.&nbsp;&nbsp; These designate, as the name Wing Tai Lung designates, a house rather than a firm, and expresses the&nbsp; sentiment and principle which shall govern its dealings.&nbsp; It might be better if the&nbsp; practice were more general.&nbsp; The construction contended for by the Government would&nbsp; not&nbsp; only forbid the Chinese&nbsp; this practice,&nbsp; but forbid them,&nbsp; as we have said, the common practice of this country, and of all commercial countries.&nbsp; The designations of very few&nbsp; business houses contain the names of all of the partners.&nbsp;&nbsp; One or two are usually named,&nbsp; and the others are not named,&nbsp; but only their&nbsp; existence&nbsp; indicated&nbsp; by the addition&nbsp; 'and company.' We can&nbsp; not believe that Congress&nbsp; intended to forbid to Chinese&nbsp; merchants, not only their own&nbsp; customs,&nbsp; but the custom of merchants wherever trading is&nbsp; practiced.&nbsp; But we construe section 2&nbsp; to&nbsp; mean&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; interest&nbsp; of the merchant must&nbsp; be&nbsp; real, and appear in&nbsp; the business and partnership articles in his own&nbsp; name, and not that his name&nbsp; must appear in the firm designation.&nbsp; And this reaches the evil which existed.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was not complained that the firm designation was a cover to deception.&nbsp; According to the stipulation, it could not be in many cases.&nbsp; It contained no name to claim.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was complained that&nbsp; an interest was claimed which stood in a name other than the claimant's, and that the ownership was established&nbsp; by Chinese testimony.&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 2 prevented this, and&nbsp; required name and ownership&nbsp; to go together, and to be established&nbsp; by the testimony of credible witnesses other than Chinese.&nbsp; This view is&nbsp; confirmed&nbsp; by considerations&nbsp; drawn from other sections of the Act. The definition of 'merchant' is general.&nbsp; The provision of section&nbsp; 2&nbsp; is:<br><br>"'The&nbsp; term merchant employed herein and in the Acts of which this Act is&nbsp; amendatory shall&nbsp; have the following meaning, and none other.'<br><br>"The definition is&nbsp; then&nbsp; given&nbsp; as hereinbefore stated. Section 6&nbsp; requires all&nbsp; Chinese laborers to register, the penalty of refusal being deportation from the country.&nbsp; All who are not merchants&nbsp; within the requirements of the definition (excluding, of&nbsp; course,&nbsp; certain&nbsp; privileged classes) are laborers;&nbsp; hence the definition applies not only to the merchant&nbsp; who claims to&nbsp; enter the United&nbsp; States, having formerly been here, but to him who stayed and while he stays.<br><br>"The interpretation of&nbsp; the Government makes the law forbid him to stay as a merchant and do business as he formerly did, and to what&nbsp; end?&nbsp;&nbsp; That he may be deported? No one desires it.&nbsp; That he may be compelled to register as a laborer?&nbsp;&nbsp; A useless compulsion.&nbsp; And, to accomplish an undesired&nbsp; or useless&nbsp; result, we are asked to attribute to Congress an&nbsp; intention to&nbsp; change the business methods of many&nbsp; people,&nbsp; and to&nbsp; compel them to adopt inconvenient and, maybe, impracticable ones.&nbsp; Chief Justice Fuller, delivering the opinion of the court in Lau Ow Bew <i>vs.</i> U. S., <i>supra,</i> said:<br><br>"'Nothing&nbsp; is better&nbsp; settled&nbsp; than&nbsp; that&nbsp; statutes should receive a sensible construction, such as will effectuate the legislative&nbsp; intention,&nbsp; and, if possible,&nbsp; so as to&nbsp; avoid an unjust or&nbsp; an&nbsp; absurd&nbsp; conclusion.'<br><br>"And the&nbsp; learned&nbsp; Chief&nbsp; Justice cites&nbsp; Church&nbsp; of&nbsp; Holy Trinity <i>vs</i>. U. S. (143 U.&nbsp; S., 457, 12&nbsp; Sup. Ct, 511) ;&nbsp; Henderson vs. Mayor (92&nbsp; U. S., 259) ; U. S.&nbsp; <i>vs</i>. Kirby (7 Wall., 482);&nbsp; Oates&nbsp; <i>vs</i>. Bank&nbsp; (100 U. S., 239).&nbsp; This is a wise canon&nbsp; of construction.&nbsp; By it language general&nbsp; enough to include other things is confined to the purpose of the lawmakers, securing it and&nbsp; avoiding confusion and disappointment, and often absurdity.&nbsp; Illustrating this canon, Justice Field, in the case of Ah Tie (13 Fed., 294), said:<br><br>"'So the judges of England construed the&nbsp; law which enacted that&nbsp; a prisoner breaking prison should be deemed guilty of felony, holding that it did not apply to one breaking&nbsp; out&nbsp; when the prison was on fire, observing that the prisoner was "not to be hanged because he would not stay to be burnt."&nbsp; And, in illustration&nbsp; of this doctrine, the construction given to the Bolognian law against drawing blood in the street is often cited.&nbsp; That law enacted that whoever thus&nbsp; drew&nbsp; blood&nbsp; should be&nbsp; punished with the utmost severity, but the courts held that it did not extend to the surgeon who&nbsp; opened the vein of a person&nbsp; falling down in&nbsp; the streets in a fit.'<br><br>"And the learned justice, <i>In re</i> Low Yam Chow, <i>supra,</i> gave two additional&nbsp; illustrations&nbsp; taken from decisions of the Supreme Court:<br><br>"'A law of Congress declares&nbsp; that whoever&nbsp; willfully obstructs or retards the carrier of the mails of the&nbsp; United States shall be deemed guilty&nbsp; of&nbsp; a&nbsp; public offense, and be punished by a&nbsp; fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; A mail carrier&nbsp; in Kentucky was arrested by the sheriff upon a charge of murder, and for the arrest the&nbsp; sheriff was indicted.&nbsp; The Supreme&nbsp; Court held that the&nbsp; general language of the Act of Congress was not to be construed to extend to the case;&nbsp; for it could not be supposed that Congress intended to interfere with the enforcement&nbsp; of the criminal laws of the&nbsp; State in its legislation&nbsp; to prevent unnecessary obstruction in the carriage of the mails.&nbsp; It would have been absurd to hold that, in order to secure the speedy transportation of the mails, immunity from punishment for&nbsp; a crime was given to the mail carrier. (U.&nbsp; S.<i> vs. </i> Kirby,&nbsp; 7&nbsp; Wall.,&nbsp; 482.)&nbsp;&nbsp; So the Act of Congress for the recovery of the proceeds of captured and abandoned property during the late war required the claimant in the Court of Claims to prove that he had&nbsp; never given&nbsp; aid or comfort to the&nbsp; rebellion; yet the Supreme Court held that one who&nbsp; had been pardoned by the President was relieved from this requirement.&nbsp; The general language of the Act covered his case,&nbsp; but, as the pardon in legal effect blotted out the guilt of the&nbsp; offender - that&nbsp; is, closed the eyes&nbsp; of the court so that it could not&nbsp; be considered as an element in the determination of his case - the&nbsp; pardon was deemed to take the place of the proof, and relieved&nbsp; him from the necessity of establishing his loyalty.&nbsp; "It is not to be supposed," said the Supreme Court, "that Congress intended by the language of the Act to encroach&nbsp; upon any of the prerogatives of the President, and especially that benign prerogative of mercy which lies&nbsp; in the&nbsp; pardoning power. It is more reasonable to conclude that claimants restored to their rights of property by the pardon of&nbsp; the President were not in contemplation of Congress in passing the Act, and were not intended to be embraced by&nbsp; the requirement in question.&nbsp; All general terms in statutes should be limited in&nbsp; their&nbsp; application&nbsp; so&nbsp; as&nbsp; not to&nbsp; lead&nbsp; to injustice, oppression, or any unconstitutional&nbsp; operation, if that be possible.&nbsp;&nbsp; It will be presumed that exceptions were intended which would avoid results of that nature."&nbsp;&nbsp; Carlisle <i>vs.</i> U. S., 16 Wall., 153.)'<br><br>"And the learned justice said, virtually, that these cases would have justified him&nbsp; in&nbsp; restricting&nbsp; section 6 of&nbsp; the Act of 1882 to merchants&nbsp; coming from China, even if the general term used in the section were&nbsp; susceptible of a larger meaning.&nbsp;&nbsp; Undoubtedly, if the purpose of the Act had been a limitation on the immigration of merchants, as it was of laborers, its language would have applied to their coming from everywhere.&nbsp; There&nbsp; can be no temptation, in order to secure the exclusion of Chinese&nbsp; laborers,&nbsp; to&nbsp; give a&nbsp; strained construction to section 2.&nbsp;&nbsp; As we construe&nbsp; it, it is entirely sufficient, and completely fulfills the objects of the legislation.&nbsp; It does not disturb real merchants&nbsp; in the privileges guaranteed&nbsp; by the treaty,&nbsp; and it prevents false&nbsp; ones from&nbsp; claiming&nbsp; them.&nbsp; It makes the definition of the word&nbsp; 'merchant' that which Mr. Geary aptly&nbsp; said it was&nbsp; intended&nbsp; to be - 'broad enough to protect every man legitimately&nbsp; engaged in&nbsp; that industry,&nbsp; and narrow enough&nbsp; to prevent the&nbsp; designation being used as an&nbsp; instrument of fraud by a class that we do not desire.'&nbsp;&nbsp; The burden of proof is on the person seeking to land, and the character of the facts which he must prove, the time which they must have existed, and the witnesses by whom proved, together with the possibilities of counter proof inevitably suggested, make deception impossible,&nbsp; except under a&nbsp; very negligent administration of the law.&nbsp;&nbsp; A place in the&nbsp; firm name would not prevent this, nor is it to be apprehended."<br></blockquote>The reasoning and authority of the foregoing decision, accepted and approved by the Supreme Court of the United States, is clearly decisive of the&nbsp; issue&nbsp; involved in this appeal, and renders further discussion wholly superfluous.<br><br>It is proper, nevertheless, to direct attention to the decisions of this court in the cases of the U.&nbsp; S. vs. Sy Quiat (12 Phil. Rep., 676) and U. S. <i>vs. </i>Lim Co&nbsp; (12 Phil. Rep., 703), in each of which we held the defendant not to be a "merchant" as that term is&nbsp; employed in the Act under consideration, the&nbsp; evidence not sustaining the claim of the defendant that he owned an&nbsp; interest in&nbsp; a certain store as alleged by him, or that his name was included in&nbsp; any partnership agreement touching the ownership of that store, and&nbsp; it affirmatively appearing that the store&nbsp; in question was&nbsp; conducted in the individual name&nbsp; of a Chinese person other than the defendant.&nbsp; Upon&nbsp; the facts thus found these decisions were clearly correct, and are in nowise in&nbsp; conflict&nbsp; with the reasoning of the decision in&nbsp; the&nbsp; case of Lee Kan <i>vs</i>.&nbsp; U. S., above cited and adopted as&nbsp; its own by&nbsp; this court.<br><br>In support of our ruling in&nbsp; those cases, we cited a number of decisions of the Federal courts, and among others we quoted at length from the&nbsp; case U. S. <i>vs.</i> Quan Gin&nbsp;&nbsp; (61 Fed. Rep., 395), which&nbsp; goes much farther than was necessary for the purposes of our decisions&nbsp; in the former cases; and&nbsp; is in direct conflict with the later decisions&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Supreme Court&nbsp; of the United States&nbsp; above&nbsp; cited,&nbsp; in so far as it holds&nbsp; that the mere fact that&nbsp; the&nbsp; name of a Chinese&nbsp; person&nbsp; is not&nbsp; included in the firm name of&nbsp; the business in which he claims to be a&nbsp; partner is sufficient ground to&nbsp; sustain a holding that the&nbsp; business is not conducted "in his own&nbsp; name," as that phrase is used in the statute defining the&nbsp; word "merchant."<br><br>The rule laid down in the Quan Gin case&nbsp; (<i>supra</i>) was not necessarily drawn in question&nbsp; by the&nbsp; facts proven in the Sy Quiat and Lim Co cases, and the only proper bearing of the Quan Gin case on those cases was to show, when taken&nbsp; together&nbsp; with the other Federal cases cited, that the Federal courts&nbsp; have uniformly held that proof that one is a "merchant" as that term&nbsp; is used1 in the Chinese-exclusion Acts is incomplete without proof that the alleged merchant conducts his business under his own name.&nbsp; The quotation from that case, however, setting out as it does the objectionable rule, doubtless was calculated to mislead those interested, and&nbsp; we are&nbsp; glad to avail&nbsp; ourselves&nbsp; of this opportunity to correct&nbsp; any mistaken inference which may have&nbsp; been&nbsp; drawn&nbsp; from the fact that this quotation appears&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; body of the opinion,&nbsp; without an express disavowal of the rule.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rule itself not being necessary to the decisions in&nbsp; the Sy&nbsp; Quiat&nbsp; and Lim Co&nbsp; cases was not given&nbsp; the consideration which it would&nbsp; have had if it had been necessary for the purpose of those cases&nbsp; to adopt or reject it, and, indeed, the attention of the court and of the writer of the opinions&nbsp; in&nbsp; those&nbsp; cases, who is also the writer of this opinion, was not directed to the Lee Kan case <i>(supra)</i> and the case in the Supreme Court&nbsp; of the United&nbsp; States adopting the reasoning of that case&nbsp; (193 U. S., 517, 518), at&nbsp; the time when the Sy Quiat and Lim Co cases were submitted.<br><br>The judgment of the court&nbsp; below discharging the defendant from custody should be affirmed and the bail bond exonerated&nbsp; with the costs of this instance against the appellant.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano,&nbsp; C.
