				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Act No. 2630 empowered the Marine Trading Company (Inc.) to bring action in 
the Court of First Instance for the city of Manila to determine the 
responsibility and liability for a collision between its launch <span style="font-style: italic;">Active </span>and a 
scow towed by the Government launch <span style="font-style: italic;">Bohol</span>, and to fix the damages, if any, to 
which the Marine Trading Company (Inc.) is entitled on account of the collision. 
Acting under this authority, the Marine Trading Company (Inc.) began action to 
recover as damages from the Government of the .Philippine Islands the sum of 
P9,677, with interest and costs, because of the reckless and negligent acts of 
the defendant's agent and employee. The Attorney-General interposed a general 
denial. Judgment was rendered by the Honorable George R. Harvey, judge of first 
instance, for the amount prayed for by plaintiff, with legal interest from 
September 25, 1916, the date of filing the complaint, and costs of suit.
<p>On August 10, 1915, plaintiff owned a launch named <span style="font-style: italic;">Active </span>and defendant owned 
a launch named <span style="font-style: italic;">Bohol</span>. Both launches were in use upon the Pasig River in the city 
of Manila. About 8 o'clock in the morning of this date, in the Pasig River, 
below and near the bridge of Spain, the launch <span style="font-style: italic;">Bohol </span>was towing up the river two 
rudderless scows or lighters, one behind the other. The scow nearest the launch 
was about 5 meters behind, was empty, and was high in the water. The second 
lighter was tied to the rear of the first one, with a distance of about 2 meters 
intervening, was loaded, and was lower in the water. The <span style="font-style: italic;">Active </span>was coming down 
the river from Pandacan toward Manila Bay. The <span style="font-style: italic;">patron </span>of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Active </span>blew one 
blast of his whistle, and the <span style="font-style: italic;">patron </span>of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Bohol </span>answered with one whistle, 
which indicated that the Active had a clear way and should pass to starboard. 
When under the bridge of Spain, the Active passed the Bohol and the first scow 
towed by it. But when the <span style="font-style: italic;">Active </span>was about to pass the second scow, the latter 
swerved to the left, and its forward left end corner struck the <span style="font-style: italic;">Active </span>on the 
port side between the cabin and the bow with such force and impact that the 
launch sank immediately.</p>
<p>The <span style="font-style: italic;">Active </span>was in good condition and state of operation before the collision 
occurred. The launch was so seriously damaged by the collision and the sinking 
that it took the sum of P9,677 to repair it.</p>
<p>The applicable provisions of law are found in articles 826, 827, 828, and 830 
of the Code of Commerce, and in the Philippine Marine Regulations issued by the 
Insular Collector of Customs. These provisions of law and these regulations, in 
relation to the facts, present the issue of whether or not the accident occurred 
through the negligence of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Bohol </span>only, or whether both launches can be blamed 
for the collision. If the first be the holding, then, under the law, plaintiff 
can recover. If the second be the result, plaintiff cannot recover.</p>
<p>The trial court was clearly of the opinion that there was negligence on the 
part; of the <span style="font-style: italic;">patron </span>of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Bohol </span>in operating his launch and the scow in such a 
way as to endanger the Active and its occupants. The court was further of the 
opinion that there was no negligence on the part of the <span style="font-style: italic;">patron </span>of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Active</span>, 
With this view of the trial court, we are in accord.</p>
<p>Negligence on the part of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Bohol </span>is demonstrated by the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>(1) The <span style="font-style: italic;">patron </span>of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Bohol </span>gave the whistle which indicated that the <span style="font-style: italic;">Active 
</span>had a clear way and should pass to the starboard, and did not give four blasts 
of the whistle in quick succession in order to denote danger.</p>
<p>(2) The two scows in tow by the <span style="font-style: italic;">Bohol </span>were apparently not properly fastened 
together, as required by section 197 of the Philippine Marine Regulations.</p>
<p>(3) The two launches passed each other under the bridge of Spain, and the 
<span style="font-style: italic;">Bohol</span>, instead of steering so as to avoid danger of a collision between the 
<span style="font-style: italic;">Active </span>and its scows, kept its course and crowded the <span style="font-style: italic;">Active </span>almost against a 
buoy. While, in accordance with paragraph 163 of the Philippine Marine 
Regulations, steam vessels towing have the right of way over steam vessels not 
towing this does not mean that the vessel with a tow can usurp the entire river 
so as to force another vessel into the bank. In conformity with the doctrine 
cited by appellant, that the preferred steamer will not be held in fault for 
maintaining her course and speed, this is only true so long as it is possible 
for the other vessel to avoid her by the proper maneuver, (<span style="font-style: italic;">The Delaware</span> [1895], 
161 U. S., 459.)</p></blockquote>
<p>As opposed to the foregoing, we find that the plaintiff's agent was in no 
way to blame for the collision.</p>
<p>This disposes of the three assignments of error and the principal issue in 
the case. It is to be noted, however, that the judgment was for legal interest 
and costs. Is this right?</p>
<p>It is the undoubted law that the State (in this jurisdiction, the Government 
of the Philippine Islands) never pays interest unless it expressly engages to do 
so. This is especially true in case the claim is an unliquidated one. Among 
other authorities, we find Angarica <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Bayard ([1888], 127 U. S., 251), in 
which Justice Blatchford said:</p>
<blockquote><p>"The case, therefore, falls within the well-settled principle, that the 
United States are not liable to pay interest on claims against them, in the 
absence of express statutory provision to that effect. It has been established, 
as a general rule, in the practice of the government, that interest is not 
allowed on claims against it, whether such claims originate in contract or in 
tort, and whether they arise in the ordinary business of administration or under 
private acts of relief, passed by Congress on special application. The only 
recognized exceptions are where the government stipulates to pay interest and 
where interest is given expressly by an Act of Congress, either by the name of 
interest or by that of damages."</p></blockquote>
<p>The rule is equally well established that the State is not liable for costs 
unless the statute expressly makes it so.</p>
<p>Here, Act No. 2630 only authorized the court to fix the damages if any, and 
to enter judgment accordingly. Unless damages can be interpreted to include 
interest and costs, plaintiff cannot recover the same. This appearing to be a 
strained interpretation, we believe we should hold to the view that since the 
government has not stipulated to pay interest or costs, the courts should not 
include these items in the judgment. (<span style="font-style: italic;">See</span> generally, 11 Encyclopedia of U. S. 
Supreme Court Reports, pp. 775-777; Marine <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Lyon [1894], 62 Fed., 153;

Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Rafferty [1918], p. 145, 
post.)</p>
<p>With the elimination of so much of the judgment as provides for interest and 
costs, judgment is affirmed, without special finding as to costs in this 
instance. So ordered.</p>
