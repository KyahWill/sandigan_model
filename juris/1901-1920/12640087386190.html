				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>It appears from  the  record that prior to  the  14th of October,  1909,. a  Chinaman by the name of Anastasio C. Chiong was conducting  a  business in  Santo Cristo street, No. 216,  in the  city of Manila,  and was indebted to  the plaintiffs herein in the sum of P1,700.</p>
<p>Upon that date the said Chiong sold said business to the said Quibiao,  with the consent and knowledge  of the plaintiffs, upon the following conditions:</p>
<p>That Quibiao  should  assume the payment of the  said indebtedness,  which was, by agreement between him and the plaintiffs herein, reduced to the sum of P880, to be paid at the rate of P80  per month, and  that the said Quibiao should give a guaranty for the payment of the said sum of P880 together with  the value of whatever other goods and merchandise the "plaintiffs might sell to him (Quibiao).</p>
<p>In accordance with this agreement between the plaintiffs and Quibiao, the  other defendants, Silverio Jiongco y Felix and Sotera  Roco y De Vera, executed and delivered a contract of guaranty (Exhibit A), by which they guaranteed the payment of the  said sum of P880, in accordance with the terms of the agreement between the plaintiffs and Quibiao,  as  well as the payment  for any goods, wares  and merchandise sold by the plaintiffs to Quibiao up to the sum of P3,000.</p>
<p>The defendant,  Quibiao, failed to comply with his agreement  with the plaintiffs  herein,  whereupon  the present action  was  commenced.  The plaintiffs  claim  that the amount due by reason of the failure of Quibiao to pay the monthly installments, together with the value of the goods sold by the plaintiffs to him, is P1,279.99.</p>
<p>After hearing the evidence  adduced during the trial of the cause, the Honorable Simplicio del Rosario, judge, found that there was due from the defendant, Quibiao, to the plaintiffs, the  sum of  P1,279.99, and  that the guarantors, under their contract of guaranty, were jointly and severally liable with him for the payment of the said  amount, together with costs.</p>
<p>From that judgment the defendant Quibiao appealed. <br></p><p>The apellant in his brief attempts to show that Quibiao is not responsible for the payment  of the sum of P880, for the reason that the provisions of section  335 of  the  Code of Procedure in Civil Actions had not been complied with. It will be noted, however, that no objection was made in the court below to the admissibility of the evidence showing Quibiao's liability.  Section 335 relates to the form of the proof simply. If the parties permit the fact to be proved by evidence other than that provided for by said section 335, it is then too late  for them to object for the first  time in this court as to the  form of the proof.</p>
<p>In the contract of guaranty executed and delivered by the defendants Silverio Jiongco y Felix and  Sotera Roco y De Vera, two  parcels of land described in the first and second paragraphs of said contract were given in guaranty for the payment  of the obligation resulting  under  said contract.  The lower court evidently treated this contract (Exhibit A) as a mortgage lien upon said parcels of land. The document (Exhibit A) was not recorded in the registry of property and can not  be considered as a mortgage, and the lands can  not, therefore, be subjected  to the  payment of the judgment herein, under the provisions of the Civil Code, upon the theory that said contract was a mortgage, but can only be subjected  to the payment of the judgment herein under an execution.  The contract of guaranty (Exhibit A) did not constitute a mortgage upon said property.</p>
<p>In our  opinion, with the modifications hereinbefore suggested,  the judgment of the lower court should be and is hereby affirmed.</p>
