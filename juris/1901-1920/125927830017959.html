				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> In the fall of 1901 Clayton J.  Bailey was an inspector of the Constabulary and in  command  of the forces stationed in the Province of Tarlac.   Complaints were made to him by some of the inhabitants of Gerona  that the defendant had robbed them of carabaos and horses.  After making investigations he seized about ninety head  of stock in the possession of the tenants of the defendant and deposited this stock in the Government corralat Tarlac.  Juan Jose produced at the trial, and there is attached to  the record, a certificate of transfer to him in June, 1896, of a caraballa marked with the brands described  in said certificate.  The witness Bailey stated that he had personally compared the brands  on one  of the animals  taken from Cardona's farm, and at the time of the trial in the corral near the court-house, with the brands that are set forth in the said certificate and that they were the same.  He also testified that Juan  Jose had claimed this animal  as his own.</p>
<p> Felix Llorente, an  inspector of Constabulary  of the fourth class, testified  that the animal referred to by the witness Bailey had been  taken from Cardona's farm; that the day of the trial he had compared the marks on it with the marks on the certificate and that they were identical.</p>
<p> Juan Jose testified that about the 5th or 6th of March as lie, in company with his uncle Paulo Jose and Cipriano Jose, was going toward Gerona with his caraballa and its calf,  he met the defendant, Cardona, with four other  persons  in an unfrequented part of the road; that Oardona, holding a revolver at his head, told him to  take himself off and leave his animals there together with the cart to which the caraballa was harnessed.  That he at once departed with  his uncle Paulo Jose and Cipriano Jose.   Juan Jose then  had in his  pocket the said certificate, but Cardona made no inquiry for it. He testified that  he had seen the animal referred to by Bailey then in the corral and that it was his.  His uncle corroborated him as to the occurrence in the road, and also stated that since that date he had seen the caraballa of Juan in the said Government corral.</p>
<p> The testimony of the  defense was directed to three points: (1) To show that Oardona was in Tarlac  and not in Gerona about March 25;  (2)  to show his good character, and (3) to the fact that one Paulo Tafiedo had bought in August, 1901, at public auction held in Gerona by the municipal authorities, the caraballa taken from Juan Jose.</p>
<p> (1)  The evidence is ample to show that Oardona by violence  and intimidation took from Juan Jose his caraballa and sent  it to his, Cardona's, farm, from which  it was taken by the Constabulary.  There was no attempt whatever to contradict the statements of Juan and Paulo Jose as to the forcible taking of the animal;  and the identification of it with the one seized on Cardona's farm was only sought to be overcome by the testimony of Paulo Tanedo, but that testimony and  the  documents presented  on a motion for a new trial fall far short of accomplishing it. The most that Tafiedo would say was that he did not know whether the caraballa which he had bought was the one taken  from Jose or not; that his had three marks, one of which was like one of those on Juan Jose's but the other two were  not.  The documentary evidence in connection with the public sale to Paulo Tailedo shows also that only one of  the three marks corresponds  to any of the three marks on the animal of Juan Jose.</p>
<p> (2) The testimony as to the whereabouts of the defendant on  March 25 was unimportant, as the evidence shows the robbery was committed about the 5th or 6th of March. The defendant in his brief claims that the evidence should be restricted to the date mentioned in the complaint, which was the 25th  of March.  In this  case, however,  the date was not a material ingredient of the offense,  and under the provisions of article 7 of General Orders, No. 58, the Government was not limited in its proof to the date stated therein.</p>
<p> (3) The testimony  as to good character could not in any event outweigh such positive and uncontradicted evidence as was  produced in this cause to  show defendant's guilt. It is to be noted  moreover that some of  the defendant's witnesses on this point admitted  on cross-examination that they  had heard that  the defendant's  reputation  prior to the American occupation of these Islands  was bad.</p>
<p>(4) In the petition for a new  trial it is  alleged that the trial  was void because the evidence was not read over to the witnesses  before they signed it as required by article 32, General Orders, No. 58.   But it does not affirmatively appear  that this was not done,  and,  even if it were not, this, without anything more appearing, would be a defect of form for which the judgment  could not be reversed. (Art. 10, General Orders, No. 58.)</p>
<p> (5) The defendant has filed a petition that he be discharged because he is included in the amnesty proclamation of July 4, 1902.   It is obvious that this petition must<br>
be denied.</p>
<p> (6) The offense proven is covered by article 503, No. 5, of the Penal Code.  The complaint did not allege that the offense  was committed in an unfrequented place.   It is not necessary to decide whether without such an allegation the defendant could be convicted under the provisions of article 504, as we arrive at the same result which the court below reached by considering the fact that the offense was committed  in  an unfrequented  place as an aggravating circumstance under the provisions of article 10.</p>
<p> (7) There is not, in our opinion, sufficient evidence to show that the defendant in the commission of the crime took advantage of his official position as provincial secretary, so as to make applicable article 10,  No. 11, of the Penal Code.   Juan Jose testified that he did not know that Cardona held this office.  It is true that he stated on cross-examination that he believed  Cardona to  be one of the authorities of Gerona, but we  do not think this sufficient to justify us in saying that his official position was a material  factor in the  crime.  Juan Jose was  induced  to abandon his  property by the revolver which Cardona held at his head  and by the fact that four men accompanied Cardona,</p>
<p> (8)  The defendant in his brief asks  us to apply in his favor article 11 of the Penal Code as an attenuating circumstance.  It  is clear that  we are  not  warranted  in making any  such application of this provision.</p>
<p> (9)  The  presence of  the  aggravating circumstance which we have taken into consideration raises  the punishment to the maximum grade.  The penalty imposed by the judge below  iÂ«  within  that grade, and the judgment  is consequently affirmed  with costs of this instance to the appellant.</p>
