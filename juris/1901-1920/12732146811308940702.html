				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In&nbsp; a civil action instituted&nbsp; in&nbsp; the court of the justice of the peace of Gapan, Province&nbsp; of Nueva Ecija, between Luis&nbsp; Borja as plaintiff&nbsp; and&nbsp; Alejandro Policarpio as defendant,&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; was rendered in favor of the former, of&nbsp; which&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter&nbsp; was notified on July&nbsp; 24,&nbsp; 1908.&nbsp; On the afternoon of Saturday, the 8th of the following month of August, the last day of&nbsp; the fifteen specified&nbsp; by law as the period for the filing&nbsp; of an appeal,&nbsp; the said Alejandro Policarpio met the justice of the&nbsp; peace&nbsp; in a private house, for the purpose,&nbsp; according to&nbsp; his own statement, of appealing,&nbsp; and the justice&nbsp; told&nbsp; him to return&nbsp; the&nbsp; following Monday.&nbsp;&nbsp; Apparently the said justice believed in good faith that this&nbsp; day was within the term prescribed&nbsp; by law for an&nbsp; appeal.&nbsp; Policarpio&nbsp; did not return on&nbsp; the&nbsp; following Monday,&nbsp; and on the petition of Luis Borja&nbsp; the&nbsp; execution of the judgment was ordered on&nbsp; the following Tuesday.<br><br>In&nbsp; view of&nbsp; these facts,&nbsp; the aforesaid&nbsp; Alejandro&nbsp; Policarpio filed suit in the Court of First Instance, praying for the annulment&nbsp; of the said judgment of the justice&nbsp; of the peace on the ground that, owing to the latter's error in computing the days&nbsp; comprised within the legal term for an appeal, he was&nbsp; prevented from filing in due time his appeal against the judgment aforesaid.<br><br>The case&nbsp; having come to trial, after the evidence had been adduced by both parties, the court rendered judgment annulling that of the justice of&nbsp; the peace, by virtue&nbsp; of the provisions of section&nbsp; 148&nbsp; of the Code of Procedure in Civil&nbsp; Actions, concluding that the facts alleged&nbsp; in the complaint had been proved.&nbsp; "It is&nbsp; a fact," the judgment states, "that the plaintiff was&nbsp; prevented from filing his appeal within the term fixed by law, either through error on his part or through error of the justice of the peace."<br><br>The important question&nbsp; to be decided in this&nbsp; case&nbsp; is what&nbsp; the present plaintiff did on the 8th day of&nbsp; August with respect to his appeal against the judgment rendered by the justice of the peace&nbsp; whether&nbsp; he did or did not file the said appeal in due&nbsp; form,&nbsp; for not having so done, not having&nbsp; actually filed an appeal on that day,&nbsp; no importance could attach to the fact that the justice&nbsp; of the peace told him to return on another day.&nbsp; On&nbsp; such&nbsp; a supposition,&nbsp; it could not&nbsp; be said that he was prevented from appealing within the legal term for&nbsp; a cause or reason not imputable to himself.<br><br>The plaintiff&nbsp; says, in&nbsp; testifying&nbsp; with regard to what occurred on&nbsp; the said 8th of August, that he met the&nbsp; justice of the peace and told him&nbsp; that he&nbsp; would file&nbsp; his&nbsp; appeal; that&nbsp; he carried&nbsp; with&nbsp; him his written appeal and&nbsp; showed it&nbsp; to&nbsp; the justice, who&nbsp; did&nbsp; not&nbsp; receive it,&nbsp; telling&nbsp; him&nbsp; to return on Monday;&nbsp; and that he took no sureties with him, but that&nbsp; he did carry money, although he made no&nbsp; intimation of his wish to deliver&nbsp; the money to him, in view&nbsp; of the fact that the latter told him to return on Monday.&nbsp; On the other hand, the justice&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; peace testified&nbsp; in his behalf that the plaintiff did not present to him, nor did he carry on&nbsp; that occasion any document whatever; that neither did he&nbsp; present&nbsp; to him any&nbsp; bond, and that he&nbsp; merely said to him that he wished to appeal, wherefore the justice told him to return&nbsp; on Monday.&nbsp; On this&nbsp; witness being asked why he did not admit the appeal as&nbsp; it was&nbsp; the fifteenth day, he answered literally as follows: "<i>It was because he brought nothing with him on that occasion." </i><br><br>Section&nbsp; 16&nbsp; of Act No.&nbsp; 1627,&nbsp; amendatory of section&nbsp; 76 of Act No. 190,&nbsp; provides as follows:<br><blockquote>"<i>An&nbsp; appeal</i> in civil causes&nbsp; shall be perfected by filing with the justice&nbsp; of the peace, within fifteen&nbsp; days after the entry&nbsp; of the&nbsp; judgment complained of, a notice that the party intends to appeal, and by depositing with such justice the appellate&nbsp; court docket fee&nbsp; of sixteen&nbsp; pesos, and by filing with him a bond in&nbsp; the sum of fifty pesos, executed to the adverse party by the appellant and by at&nbsp; least one sufficient&nbsp; surety, conditioned that the appellant&nbsp; will pay all costs&nbsp; which&nbsp; the Court of First Instance may award against him.&nbsp; In lieu of such a&nbsp; bond, the&nbsp; appellant may file with the justice a certificate of the proper&nbsp; official that the appellant has deposited twenty-five pesos with&nbsp; the municipal&nbsp; treasurer (in Manila with&nbsp; the Collector of Internal&nbsp; Revenue)&nbsp; and&nbsp; that said&nbsp; sum&nbsp; is&nbsp; available for the satisfaction of any judgment for costs that may be rendered against appellant by the appellate court in said cause."</blockquote>Even admitting as true the whole testimony of the plaintiff, the conclusion is&nbsp; that all&nbsp; he did&nbsp; on&nbsp; that occasion amounted&nbsp; to no&nbsp; more&nbsp; than a&nbsp; mere intention to appeal, which was not carried&nbsp; out, or at least was not effected in the manner required by law.&nbsp; Neither did he&nbsp; deposit the P16 for the court fee, nor execute the bond required by law, nor even&nbsp; make any offer of the one or&nbsp; the other, nor did he make the slightest&nbsp; intimation&nbsp; that he was willing at&nbsp; that moment to comply with the&nbsp; said&nbsp; requirements, which was the least that&nbsp; he could have&nbsp; done in&nbsp; order to file his appeal in due form.&nbsp; Far&nbsp; from doing this, he himself asserted that he took no&nbsp; sureties with&nbsp; him and did not tell the justice of&nbsp; the peace that he carried money. And he also testified that what he said to the latter was only that he&nbsp; would file an appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp; But&nbsp; the appeal was not filed.&nbsp;&nbsp; He did not comply with, nor&nbsp; did he do&nbsp; anything to comply with any of the essential&nbsp; formalities prescribed by law for the perfecting of an&nbsp; appeal.&nbsp; As the justice of the peace states, when he&nbsp; saw that the plaintiff brought nothing,&nbsp; that is, neither money for a deposit nor a bond, he told him to return on Monday.&nbsp; Consequently, the fact of&nbsp; saying that he was&nbsp; to return&nbsp; on another day was not the reason why the appeal&nbsp; was&nbsp; not filed within the term&nbsp; specified by law; it was said because the plaintiff did not then formally file&nbsp; the appeal.&nbsp; We find, therefore, that it has not been&nbsp; shown&nbsp; that the&nbsp; latter was prevented through error or&nbsp; other&nbsp; cause not&nbsp; imputable to himself from filing the appeal in due time.<br><br>The judgment appealed from is reversed&nbsp; and the petition contained in the complaint is denied, without special finding as to costs of&nbsp; this instance.<br><br><i>Arellano,&nbsp; C.
