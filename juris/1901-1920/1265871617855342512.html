				<BR><STRONG>MORELAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of the 
Province of Ilocos Sur by the sureties on an appeal bond rendered against them 
for the sum of P2,000, and from an order for the issuance of an execution 
thereon.
<p>On the 9th of July, 1910, one Jose Florendo obtained judgment against 
Eustaquio P. Foz, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"For the reasons above expressed, the court decrees the specific performance 
by the defendant of the contract for the purchase and sale of the lands, said 
defendant to deliver to plaintiff the land described in the complaint; said 
defendant paying to the plaintiff the rents which he would have received for 
said lands described in the complaint from the 1st day of July, 1909, until full 
compliance with this judgment; that from the P4,000 deposited in the provincial 
treasury of Ilocos Sur there be paid to the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church of 
Vigan the mortgage now due which the said church holds against the defendant, 
together with the costs of the action; that the balance of the said P4,000 after 
satisfying this decree shall be paid to the said defendant."</p></blockquote>
<p>An appeal was taken from that judgment and, to stay execution, a bond was 
given with Juan Calvo and Luis Foz as sureties, in which the parties thereto 
recognized that they were "jointly and severally obligated to said Jose Florendo 
in the sum of two thousand pesos (P2,000) Philippine currency, for the payment 
of which well and truly to be made" they bound themselves "jointly and 
severally." The condition of the obligation was "that the appellant was 
obligated to the appellee in the sum of P2,000 Philippine currency, for the 
fulfillment of the judgment appealed from, in case it should be wholly or partly 
affirmed." </p>
<p>The judgment appealed from was affirmed by the Supreme Court.<span class="style2"><sup>[1]</sup></span></p>
<p>On the 20th of May 1912, the Court of First Instance ordered the provincial 
treasurer, in whose custody the sum of P4,000 mentioned in the judgment then 
was, to deliver to the clerk of the court the sum of P4,000, at the same time 
authorizing and ordering said clerk to pay to the Roman Catholic Apostolic 
Church of Nueva Segovia, or to its representative or attorneys, the sum of 
P2,920.59, which was the amount of the mortgage held by said church against the 
defendant Eustaquio P. Foz, together with interest thereon.</p>
<p>On the 24th of June, 1912, the sheriff of Ilocos Sur moved the court for an 
order requiring the delivery to him of the balance of the P4,000, or the sum of 
P1,079.41, in part satisfaction of another judgment against said Eustaquio P. 
Foz obtained on the 7th of March, 1911, in the Court of First Instance of the 
city of Manila. On the 28th of June, 1912, in pursuance of this motion the court 
ordered its clerk to deliver to said sheriff for the purpose specified the said 
sum of P1,079.41, the balance of the said P4,000. This payment was made to the 
sheriff on the 20th of July, 1912.</p>
<p>On the 22d of July, 1912, the plaintiff in this case moved the court for the 
issuance of an execution for the recovery of the other sums found by the 
judgment heretofore referred to as due and owing from the defendant to the 
plaintiff. In pursuance of this motion the court on the 31st of August, 1912, 
issued an execution to the sheriff of the city of Manila directing him to seize 
goods and chattels of Eustaquio P. Foz for the recovery of the sum of P2,294.64. 
On the 14th of October following, the sheriff of Manila returned the execution 
<em>nulla bona,</em> stating in his return that Eustaquio P. Foz had no goods or 
chattels subject to levy and sale. On the 11th of November following, the 
attorney for the plaintiff moved the court for the issuance of an execution 
against the property of the sureties, Juan Calvo and Luis Foz, to the extent of 
P2,000. The said sureties appeared to combat said motion, asked that the 
execution of the judgment be sus pended and that the court declare that the 
payment of said sum of P1,079.41 to the sheriff of Ilocos Sur for the purposes 
for which it was paid was illegal and prejudicial to the interests of the 
sureties. They also prayed that all the goods and chattels of Eustaquio P. Foz 
be levied upon and sold for the satisfaction of the execution before their 
property was made subject thereto.</p>
<p>The learned trial court denied these motions and ordered that execution issue 
against the sureties Juan Calvo and Luis Foz for the satisfaction of the 
judgment referred to, not to exceed the sum of P2,000, the penalty of the 
undertaking. This appeal is from that order.</p>
<p>The appellants assign two errors. First, that "the Court of First Instance 
erred in not declaring invalid and of no force or effect the payment of the sum 
of P1,079.41 to the sheriff of Ilocos Sur in part satisfaction of the execution 
issued by the clerk of the Court of First Instance of Manila on the 30th day of 
April, 1912." Second, that "the court erred in not declaring null and void the 
undertaking executed by Juan Calvo and Luis Foz jointly and severally with 
Eustaquio P. Foz upon the ground that said Foz was insolvent at the time of and 
since the execution of said undertaking."</p>
<p>Speaking of the second alleged error first, we might say that we have been 
cited to no provision of law, and we know of none, which renders an appeal bond 
void because the appellant happens to be insolvent at the time the bond is 
executed. The precise purpose of a bond on appeal is to protect the appellee 
from the insolvency of the appellant and to assure to him the effective 
execution of the judgment on the termination of the litigation.</p>
<p>In regard to the first error assigned, the appellants argue that they bound 
themselves to the fulfillment of the judgment ip. case it should be affirmed and 
that said judgment contained a clause that the balance of the P4,000, after 
paying the mortgage held by the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church, should be 
turned over to the appellant in the action in which said judgment was obtained; 
and that it was a breach of the condition upon which the bond was given to 
permit that sum to be turned over for the payment of another and different 
judgment. They also argue that said sum having been paid to a stranger instead 
of to the defendant and appellant, the execution in all its parts of the 
judgment appealed from was rendered impossible, the defendant was deprived of 
certain resources which he otherwise would have had, and the plaintiff and 
appellee in this case would have collected upon his execution said sum of 
P1,079.41, thus reducing to that extent the sum which the sureties must pay. 
</p>
<p>Perhaps the appellants have some grievance at the manner in which the 
P1,079.41 was handled by the court when we look at the requirements of the 
judgment for the execution of which they stood guarantors. It is a grievance, 
however, which, in our judgment, cannot be remedied in this proceeding or on 
this appeal, even if it be conceded that it have a remedy at all. The sureties 
bound themselves to the fulfillment of the judgment, not in those particulars in 
which it was favorable to the appellants, but to those in which it was favorable 
to the appellee. The appellee, if his judgment should be affirmed, was entitled 
to receive a certain sum of money, or a sum which, by a subsequent procedure, 
was made certain. To assure him the payment of this sum, the obligation was 
incurred by the sureties on the bond. They may have had, generally speaking, 
strong reasons to believe that in case they were obliged to pay the judgment 
they would receive the benefit of the sum of P1,079.41, which the court had 
ordered to be turned over to the defendant after the payment of the church 
mortgage. This, however, was merely an expectation, a hope rather than a right. 
The judgment upon which that sum was paid might have taken preference over the 
judgment for the payment of which they stood surety. In that event there would 
have been grave doubt of the efficacy of the order, if contested, that said sum 
of P1,079.41 be paid upon said judgment, as against the rights of the 
judgment-creditor upon whose judgment the sum was actually paid. To say the 
least, the sureties took the chance of having that sum withdrawn from the 
defendant's resources and paid upon another obligation, or of having it paid to 
Foz himself for his personal use. As a legal proposition the sureties agreed to 
see that the judgment appealed from should be paid if affirmed, and that is all 
that the appellee is asking of them.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs against the 
appellants.</p>
