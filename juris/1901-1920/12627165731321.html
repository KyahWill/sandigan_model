				G.R. No. 2737, August 23, 1906</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED  STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. EUSEBIO BROCE, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>We accept the findings of fact and the conclusions of law contained in the judgment rendered in the court below on the 29th of April, 1905, whereby the defendant, Eusebio Broce, was convicted of the crime of misappropriation of public funds and sentenced to two years four months and one day of imprisonment (<em>presidio correccional</em>) with the accessories of the law  to indemnify the municipal treasury of San Carlos in the sum of 259.83½ pesos, with interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum  from the 4th  day of February, 1904, until fully paid, and in case of insolvency to suffer the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment, and to pay the costs.  It is to be noted,  however, that  part of the money embezzled by the defendant was misappropriated by him as treasurer of the municipality of San  Carlos, without detriment or hindrance to the public service, and the money not having been refunded, he should be punished, not in accordance with article 392, but article 390 of the Penal Code.</p>
<p>As  to the unsupported allegations of the defense, the embezzlement having been fully established, even accepting the second liquidation made as correct, and since  it does not appear that the new entries  made  subsequent to the first liquidation were false, the defendant is, nevertheless, guilty of embezzlement of a more or  less considerable sum of money which he  had in his custody by virtue of his office, he having failed to give any satisfactory account of the shortage.</p>
<p>The new liquidation of accounts which he claims  to have submitted to the provincial treasurer in the month  of May following does not affect  the result in this case so far as his liability is concerned, because it  does not appear that such liquidation was accepted and approved by the  provincial treasurer.  Moreover, this subsequent liquidation was not introduced in evidence at the trial, and its voluntary omission leads us to presume that it was as incorrect as the first one.  Further, it does not  conduce in any way to show that the defendant is innocent.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that Eusebio Broce misapplied and converted the sum of 259.83½ pesos, or at least 105.76 pesos  according  to the last liquidation, and that he has failed to show that he has lawfully disposed of either of the said amounts.  It should be noted that in either case the adequate penalty that should be imposed upon the defendant is that of <em>presidio correctional</em> in  its medium and maximum  degrees, imposed in its medium degree for the reason that he being  a public official duly  appointed, it is to be  presumed  that  he  was capable of discharging the duties  of the office held  by him  when he embezzled the money, and the special extenuating circumstances of article 11 of the Penal Code can not, therefore, be considered in his favor.</p>
<p>For the reasons hereinbefore set out we are of the opinion that the judgment of the court below, should  be affirmed with  the  costs of this instance  against  the  defendant, Eusebio Broce.   It is, however, the judgment of this court that he be sentenced to three years six months and twenty-one days' imprisonment  (<em>presidio correctional</em>)  with the accessories provided  in article 58 of  the Penal  Code; to temporary special disqualification for the term  of eleven years and one day; to reimburse the municipal  treasury in the sum of 105.76 pesos with interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum as provided in the judgment of  the court below, and in case of insolvency to suffer the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment.   After the expiration of ten days from the date of final judgment the case will be remanded to the court below for proper procedure.  So ordered.</p>
