				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On the 9th of May, 1902, Roberto Figueras and Jose T. Figueras brought an action in the Court of First Instance of Iloilo against a Chinaman named Manuel Vy-Tiepco, for the recovery of the sum of $1,544 and costs.   The facts set forth in the complaint were that on January 29, 1900, it was agreed between the parties that the defendant  should build a house on Rosario Street, Iloilo, in  accordance with plans drawn for  that  purpose, and  that the construction of the house should be completed within four months in strict conformity  with the terms and conditions  of  the contract signed by the  defendant Vy-Tiepco and the plaintiff Jose Figueras; that the defendant did  not build  the house in accordance with the  agreement, but left many parts thereof uncompleted, whereby the value of the work performed  was diminished in the sum of f&gt; 1,544, as shown by  the  statement  of the  items of uncompleted work  attached to the complaint; that, a demand having been made upon the defendant by the plaintiffs for the performance of the contract in  the manner agreed upon, the defendant refused to  do  so,  thereby causing the plaintiffs damages in the sum expressed.</p>
<p>The defendant presented a demurrer to the complaint and, after  argument thereon, it was agreed between  the parties  litigant that the defendant  should withdraw  the demurrer and that the plaintiffs would present the original plan in accordance with which the house was to have been constructed and of which the attorney for the plaintiffs at that time exhibited a copy.</p>
<p>The defendant on July 24, 1902, filed his answer to  the complaint.  In it he denied the facts alleged in paragraphs 2 and 3 of the complaint, and stated that while it was true that in 1900 he had agreed to build the house on Rosario Street, Iloilo, for the  plaintiffs, upon  the condition that it was to be terminated within four months, it was to be constructed in accordance with the detailed plans prepared for that purpose, and that this agreement had been reduced to writing in a contract signed January 29, 1900; that he had fully performed the contract within  the term fixed, with the exception of two arches between the dining room and the sitting room in the lower story, and  that these arches were omitted by  order of the plaintiff Roberto Figueras, who, in the absence of Jose T. Figueras, had charge of  the inspection  of the  work; that  the omission of  the arches in question had been  directed because of the intention of the plaintiffs to use that part of the  premises as a storeroom, which  they did in fact do after the work was completed and the  building delivered to the  owners; that  the latter paid the defendant $1,000, the balance due,  in  accordance with the agreement, without making any claim whatever; that for other work performed by the defendant, not provided for in the agreement, the plaintiffs, when  the building was finally turned over to them, paid the defendant the additional sum  of $600;  and that the plans presented by the plaintiff were not the  plans to which  the contract referred and in accordance with which the house was built.   The answer  terminated by  asking for judgment in favor of the defendant, with costs to the plaintiffs.</p>
<p>The defendant excepted  to the judgment rendered and prepared a bill of exceptions.  This  bill was allowed  by the trial judge, and the case was brought to this court  for determination solely of the questions of law raised therein. We can not review the evidence or make findings upon  the controverted  facts, as no motion for a new trial was made in  compliance, with the provisions  of section 497 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p>The decision of this court below was rendered in accordance with the prayer of the plaintiffs, upon the supposition that the defendant had failed  to complete at least eleven items of the work  of construction of the house which he had by contract undertaken to build.  The court based this conclusion upon the copy of the plan presented in evidence by the plaintiffs, notwithstanding the fact that the defendant objected to its admission upon the ground that it was not the original plan to which the contract referred.</p>
<p>It does not appear  to have been shown that the  plan offered in  evidence was the original plan  which formed part of the contract.  On the contrary, the plan produced shows details and deficiencies  which demonstrate conclusively that it was not the one which was to be followed in the construction of the house the defendant agreed to build for the plaintiffsâ€”that the original plan  was not produced in evidence and that the plan  presented had been  drawn subsequently.</p>
<p>Without the original plan, it is impossible to hold that there has been any broach of the contract; that the contractor  failed to  perform the work specified in  the statement presented (p.  1.3) or that the plaintiffs, as  owners of the house1, are entitled to recover from the defendant the amount claimed as  the value of the work alleged to have been omitted.</p>
<p>The court below  accordingly erred in rendering judgment in  favor of the plaintiffs, upon the ground that the construction of the house was not completed in accordance with the plan exhibited by the plaintiffs.   The trial judge has taken as the basis of his decision a document which was not the one agreed upon and which  was properly objected to by the defendant, since it was not shown  that it was the original plan referred to in the written contract entered into by the  parties thereto.</p>
<p>For the reasons stated, avc are of the  opinion that the judgment below must be set aside, and, after the expiration of twenty days from the  date of the registry of  this decision, judgment will  be entered accordingly.   The case will be returned  to the court below for anew trial, at the instance of the plaintiffs, with the costs of this instance to the latter.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Cooper, Willard, Mapa,</em> and <em>McDonough,  JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
