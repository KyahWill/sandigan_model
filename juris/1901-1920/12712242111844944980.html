				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The defendants were convicted in the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of the Province of&nbsp; Tarlac, Hon. Julio&nbsp; Llorente&nbsp; presiding, of the crime of calumny, and each sentenced to five months'<i> arresto mayor</i>, to pay a fine of 625 pesetas, with the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency and to each pay one-half of the costs.&nbsp; They appealed, and now insist that the trial court erred:<br><ol type="1"><li>In permitting the trial to proceed upon the complaint of the provincial fiscal;<br><br></li><li>In finding that the proof s presented established the guilt of the defendants of the crime of calumny beyond a reasonable doubt; and,<br><br></li><li>In applying the provisions of paragraph 1, article 454, of the Penal&nbsp; Code.</li></ol>From the record it appears that Trinidad B. Cruz, single, 22 years of age, and the defendants, who are husband and wife, were, during&nbsp; the months of May and June, 1909, traveling merchants or peddlers.&nbsp; The defendants desiring to go to the town&nbsp; of San Juan de Guimba for the purpose of selling their goods it was agreed that Trinidad stay over night at their house to take care&nbsp; of the children and to look after certain effects which were deposited in said house.&nbsp; In pursuance of this agreement, the defendants left on May 29, leaving Trinidad in charge of their house,&nbsp; where&nbsp; she remained until&nbsp; early the following morning when she left for Manila before the defendants' return.&nbsp; The&nbsp; defendants, on examining their trunk some two days later, found that a certain diamond ring was missing.&nbsp; On making this&nbsp; discovery they called on Emilia Lumutan, cousin of the offended party, and said that Trinidad had taken the ring.&nbsp; Emilia caused her cousin,&nbsp; who was still in Manila, to be notified of this charge.&nbsp; Trinidad returned&nbsp; home and the two&nbsp; defendants on June 22 went to the house where she&nbsp; was living and accused her, in the presence of three witnesses, of having taken the said ring.&nbsp; She protested against this accusation, declaring that she&nbsp; was innocent of such a charge, and went before the justice of the peace on the 24th of that month and filed a criminal complaint&nbsp; against her&nbsp; accusers,&nbsp; charging them with the crime of <i>injurias.</i>&nbsp; An investigation followed and the defendants were held to answer to&nbsp; this charge in the Court of First Instance.&nbsp;&nbsp; A new complaint was filed in the Court&nbsp; of First Instance by the provincial&nbsp; fiscal, charging' the defendants with the crime&nbsp; of calumny.&nbsp;&nbsp; This new complaint was not signed by the offended party.&nbsp; The fiscal conducted the prosecution the same as in other cases.<br><br>Counsel for the defendants insists that calumny being a private crime can only be prosecuted&nbsp; on the complaint of the offended party, except&nbsp; in those cases wherein&nbsp; special provision is otherwise made, and in support of this proposition cites paragraph 2, article 467 of the Penal Code, which reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"No one shall be punished for calumny or contumely unless on complaint of the offended party, except when the offense is directed against the&nbsp; public authority, corporations, or determined classes in the State, and in the cases prescribed in Chapter V of Title III of this book."<br></blockquote>Under the Penal Code this contention of counsel&nbsp; appears to be well founded, as the case under consideration does not come within the&nbsp; exceptions.<br><br>The first section of Act No. 1773, passed October 11, 1907, provides:<br><blockquote>"Hereafter the crimes of <i>adulterio, estupro,&nbsp; rapto, violacion, calumnia, and injuria</i>, as&nbsp; defined by the Penal Code of the Philippine Islands, shall be deemed to be public crimes and shall be prosecuted in the same manner as are all other crimes defined&nbsp; by said Penal Code or by the Acts of the Philippine Commission: Provided,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; That no prosecution for the&nbsp; crimes of<i> adulterio, estupro,&nbsp; or injuria</i> committed&nbsp; against persons other&nbsp; than&nbsp; public&nbsp; officials or employees shall be instituted except upon the complaint of the&nbsp; aggrieved person&nbsp; or of the parents, grandparents, or guardian of such person."</blockquote>The crimes mentioned in the foregoing section are now public offenses and are prosecuted in&nbsp; the same manner as are all other public offenses,&nbsp; except&nbsp; prosecutions for the crimes of <i>adulterio</i> and <i>estupro</i>; and for the crime of <i>injuria,</i> when this, latter crime is not committed against public officials or employees, can only be instituted upon the complaint of the aggrieved person,&nbsp; or the parents, grandparents, or guardian of such person.&nbsp; No such provision was made with reference to <i>rapto, violacion,</i> and,<i> calumnia. </i> These were made public offenses&nbsp; without any restrictions&nbsp; as to the manner in which they should be instituted.&nbsp; Calumny is now a public crime and can be prosecuted upon the complaint of the provincial fiscal, while <i>injuria</i> can only be prosecuted upon the complaint of the offended party, when such offended party is not a public official or employee.&nbsp; It was the&nbsp; intention&nbsp; of&nbsp; the legislative body that&nbsp; these two&nbsp; crimes be treated&nbsp; in this manner and the will of the Legislature, as clearly expressed in the above section, is now the law of the land.<br><br>The next question to be determined is whether or not the crime which the defendants accused the&nbsp; offended party of having committed is "grave" or "less grave."<br><br>Articles 6, 25, 452,&nbsp; and 454 of the Penal Code are as follows:<br><blockquote>"Art.&nbsp; 6. Crimes are considered&nbsp; 'grave' which&nbsp; the&nbsp; law punishes by&nbsp; penalties&nbsp; which in any&nbsp; of&nbsp; their degrees are corporal.<br><br>"Crimes&nbsp; are considered 'less grave' which the law represses&nbsp; by&nbsp; penalties which&nbsp; in&nbsp; their maximum degree are correccional."<br><br>"Art. 25. The penalties which may be imposed according to this code, and their&nbsp; different classes, are those included in the following general scale:<br><br>"<i>Corporal penalties</i>. - Death; <i>cadena perpetua; reclusion perpetua; relegacion perpetua; </i>perpetual&nbsp; expulsion; <i>cadena temporal; reclusion&nbsp; temporal; relegacton temporal</i>; temporary explusion; <i>presidio mayor; prision mayor; confinamiento;</i>&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br><br>"<i><i>Correctional penalties</i></i>. - P<i>residio correccional;&nbsp; prision correccional;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; arresto mayor."</i><br><br>"Art. 452. Calumny is the false imputation of a crime of those subject to prosecution at the instance of the Government (<i>de oficio</i>)."<br><br>"Art.&nbsp; 454. When the calumny is not made public and put into writing it shall be punished:<br><br>"1. With the penalties of arresto mayor in its maximum degree and a fine of from 625 to 6,250 pesetas if a grave crime be charged.<br><br>"2. With that&nbsp; of arresto mayor in its&nbsp; minimum degree and a fine of from 325 to 3,250 pesetas if a less grave crime be charged."</blockquote>It is alleged in the complaint that the defendants did maliciously and falsely, with a view to dishonoring or holding up to contempt, Trinidad B. Cruz, charge her with the crime of robbery.&nbsp; According to articles 6 and 25, above quoted, robbery,&nbsp; as alleged&nbsp; in the complaint, is a "grave" crime.<br><br>While&nbsp; it is alleged in the complaint that the accused charged the offended party with the crime of robbery, the proofs do not support&nbsp; this allegation.&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the testimony of the offended party&nbsp; herself, the&nbsp; defendants charged&nbsp; her&nbsp; with having taken the ring.&nbsp; They did not charge her with having taken the ring by employing force. The defendants in their testimony state that on examining their trunk they found that&nbsp; the ring was missing.&nbsp;&nbsp; This testimony is&nbsp; uncontradicted and shows that no force was used in obtaining possession of the ring.&nbsp;&nbsp; From the&nbsp; whole history of the case it clearly&nbsp; appears that the defendants did knowingly and&nbsp; maliciously charge the&nbsp; offended&nbsp; party with having stolen the ring, and not with&nbsp; having obtained it&nbsp; by force.&nbsp; So&nbsp; the&nbsp; real crime&nbsp; imputed&nbsp; to the offended party was that of larceny and not robbery.&nbsp; The value of the ring&nbsp; is not known, but under the provisions of articles 517 and&nbsp; 518&nbsp; of the Penal Code the highest penalty&nbsp; which can be imposed for the crime of larceny is <i>correccional.</i> The crime&nbsp; imputed to the offended party&nbsp; being less grave, under the provisions of the Code above quoted, the penalty set out in paragraph 2 of said article 454 must be applied.<br><br>The judgment appealed from&nbsp; is, therefore, reversed and each of the defendants is hereby sentenced to one month and one day <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor,</span> to pay a fine of 325 pesetas, to suffer the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to each pay&nbsp; one-half&nbsp; of the costs.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J., Mapa, Carson</i>, and <i>Moreland, JJ</i>., concur.<br></div>
