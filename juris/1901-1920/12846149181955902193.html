				G.R. No. 12845, September 26, 1917</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. FRANCISCO GAFFUD AND MARIA ANASTASIO, DEFENDANTS. FRANCISCO GAFFUD, APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Two Constabulary soldiers, taking a walk through the municipality of 
Naguilian, Province of Isabela, passed the house in which lived Francisco 
Gaffud, justice of the peace of Naguilian, and his wife Maria Anastasio. 
Thinking that they smelt opium, the soldiers passed into the yard and finding 
the doors and windows of the house closed, finally discovered an opening through 
which they looked into the house and saw Gaffud smoking opium. Returning to the 
<em>cuartel</em>, the soldiers reported to their commanding officer who procured 
a warrant from the judge of first instance for the search of the house occupied 
by Francisco Gaffud and his wife. In the possession of the wife Maria Anastasio, 
and elsewhere in the house, were found various articles used to smoking opium 
together with a small amount of the drug. During the trial of the case, the 
judge made an inspection of the house and found that the story of the soldiers 
as to their being able to look through a hole and see Gaffud smoking opium was 
plausible. The sole witness for the defense was the accused Maria Anastasio, who 
confessed her guilt and endeavored to relieve her husband of criminal 
responsibility.
<p>The trial court found the defendant and appellant Francisco Gaffud guilty as 
charged and sentenced him to three months imprisonment, to pay a fine of P300 or 
to suffer subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay one-half of 
the costs. The findings of fact, on which this judgment is based, are in accord 
with the proof. The sentence likewise would ordinarily not be disturbed for it 
is the practice of this court, in the exercise of its discretion, to impose the 
minimum penalty provided by law upon a person convicted for the first time of 
having a small quantity of opium in his possession. (U. S. <em>vs</em>. Lim Sing 
[1912], 23 Phil., 424; U. S. <em>vs</em>. Sy Liongco [1915], 33 Phil., 53; U. S. 
vs. Ong Siu Hong [1917], p. 735, ante, and other cases.) We should, however, 
consider one attendant circumstance herein as taking the facts out of the proper 
scope of this rule and as sufficient reason for the imposition of a more severe 
penaltyâ€”i. e., the defendant and appellant was a justice of the peace. The fall 
of an ignorant opium fiend might be condoned, as far as lies in judicial 
discretion. The violation of the same statute by a person of standing in the 
community, tending to exploit the vice and to bring the law into disrepute, 
cannot so easily be overlooked. In consequence of what has been said, we modify 
the judgment of the lower court and sentence the defendant and appellant to four 
months imprisonment, to pay a fine of P400, or to suffer subsidiary imprisonment 
in case of insolvency, and to pay one-half the costs of the first instance and 
the costs of this instance. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Johnson, Carson, Araullo</em>, and <em>Street, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p></div>
