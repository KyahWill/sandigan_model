				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Appellants in this case were convicted in the  court below of the crime of robbery in an armed  band, committed on or about the 11th day of May, 1900.  The trial court found, and the record clearly discloses:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"That on May  11, 1900, one Elias Oro, president of the municipality  of Sapian,  Province of Capiz,  Philippine Islands, was engaged with a large number of other citizens of said  town  in  the  celebration of a  religious festival at a place in said town known as Matavia and situated on the seashore; that some time  during the forenoon of said day one Leocadio Pajarillo, accompanied by the accused and a number of other  persons,  appeared upon the scene, many of them armed with guns,  revolvers, bolos, and other arms; that said Leocadio Pajarillo was chief of the band,  the members of which acted under his orders in the commission of the depredations hereinafter mentioned; that Elias Oro attempted  to escape, but was captured and brought back to the beach, where he was severely beaten by Pajanuo for the purpose of making him  reveal his personal property; that  because of said beating Elias Oro caused to be brought  to the  beach at Matavia  a  trunk containing the sum of $700 Mexican currency, and certain jewelry of the value of  $150 Mexican currency, the property of Elias Oro, which property was, by  intimidation and violence, taken from said  Elias Oro by said Pajarillo  and  the accused; that said Pajarillo and the accused also, by force and intimidation,  took from  the  store-house of said  Elias  Oro in Matavia 800 <em>cavanes</em> of rice, the property  of said Elias Oro and of  the value  of $2,500  Mexican currency; that said Pajarillo and the  accused caused the said Elias Oro to be bound and detained on the beach at Matavia from shortly before  noon on the  morning  of the  11th  day of May, 1900, to about dawn of the following day, when  he made his escape; that on the same occasion  and at the same place said Pajarillo and the accused, by force  and violence, took from  the wife  of Elias Oro the sum of $300 Mexican currency, the property  of Elias  Oro; that after securing the above-described  property, some of the  accused, at the command of Leocadio Pajarillo, by force and violence, appropriated and took away  from the agents of said EHas Oro, 36  carabaos, the property of Elias Oro, of the value  of $1,920 Mexican  currency; also 2 carabaos  valued  at $120 Mexican  currency,  clothing of the value of $80 Mexican currency, and $20 Mexican currency, in money, the prop erty of Gregorio Nunez.   The court finds that the value of the property of Elias Oro, taken as  above mentioned, is P7,414.27 Philippine currency, and that the value of that taken from Gregorio Nunez is P235.95 Philippine currency; that the taking of all of the property heretofore mentioned was  a part of the same raid  or expedition  of Leocadio Pajarillo, the accused, and other  persons to the court unknown."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Appellants contend that they are entitled to the benefits of the Amnesty Proclamation of July 4, 1902, and we think that this claim must be sustained. </p>
<p>In our decision in the case of U. S. <em>vs.</em> Pajarillo (19 Phil. Rep., 288) filed April 5, 1911, we had occasion to consider a plea of amnesty entered on  behalf of the appellants in that case who were convicted of the crime of assassination committed on the same day, and in the course of the very raid upon which  the robbery now under consideration was committed.</p>
<p>In that opinion we held  as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Accepting,  as we  do,  the material  testimony for  the prosecution, and rejecting, as we do, the material testimony offered by the defense, the  judgment of the court below, convicting and sentencing these defendants must be affirmed, with the costs of  this instance against the appellants, unless they are entitled to the benefit of the Amnesty Proclamation by the President of the United States, dated July 4, 1902. In the court below the protection afforded by the plea of amnesty was claimed on behalf of Leocadio  Pajarillo; and in this court,  counsel urges on behalf of all  the appellants that even if the court be of  opinion that the evidence sustains the  contention of the prosecution  that these defendants and appellants are the four individuals who fired upon and killed Giriaco Occefio, deceased, as charged in the information, nevertheless, upon  the facts  developed by the whole record,  they are entitled  to the benefits of  the Amnesty Proclamation.</p>
  <p>"The declarative portion of  the  Amnesty  Proclamation is as follows: </p>
  <p>" 'Now, therefore, be it known that I, Theodore Roosevelt, President of the United States of  America, by virtue  of the power and authority vested in me by the Constitution, do hereby proclaim and declare, without reservation or condition, except  as  hereinafter provided, a full and complete pardon and amnesty to all  persons in the Philippine Archipelago who have participated in the  insurrections aforesaid or who have given aid and  comfort to persons participating in said insurrections, for the offenses of treason or sedition and for all offenses political in their character committed in the course of such insurrections pursuant to orders issued by the civil or military insurrectionary authorities or which grew out of internal political feuds or dissensions between Filipinos and Spaniards or the Spanish authorities or which resulted from internal political feuds or dissensions among the Filipinos themselves during either of said insurrections. </p>
  <p>" '<em>Provided, however</em>, That the pardon and amnesty hereby granted shall not include such persons committing crimes since May first, nineteen hundred and two, in any province of the Archipelago in which at the time  civil  government was established, nor shall it include  such persons as have been heretofore finally convicted of the crimes of murder, rape,  arson,  or robbery by any military  or civil tribunal organized under the authority of Spain or of the United States of America, but special application may  be  made to the proper authority for pardon by any person belonging to the exempted classes, and such clemency as is  consistent with humanity and justice will be liberally extended.'" </p>
  <p>"In the  case of the  United  States vs.  Luzon (2 Phil. Rep.,  380), this court laid down the following proposition (p. 381) : </p>
  <p>" 'To entitle a person to the benefits of this proclamation two things, at least, must concur: (1) He must have participated in  the insurrections  against  Spain  or the United States.   (2)  The crime wifh which he is  charged must be political in its nature.  Common  crimes, such as murder and robbery, are not included within the amnesty  unless they were committed under circumstances which  clothe them with a political character.   This court has constantly adhered to this doctrine.' "</p>
  <p>"While we  are of opinion  that the crime of murder committed by these appellants is not one of those included in the Amnesty Proclamation, we are not entirely agreed with the judge  of the trial court  as to the precise grounds upon which the claims of its benefits should be  denied.</p>
  <p>"We base our denial of the benefits of the Amnesty Proclamation  strictly  upon  the  proposition that not  only is there nothing in the record which would sustain a finding that the crime  of murder of  which these appellants  are convicted was political in character, but that on the contrary the evidence strongly tends to disclose a  motive for the slaying of the deceased wholly  inconsistent with such a characterization of the offense. </p>
  <p>"The trial judge seems to have laid considerable stress on his finding of a failure of proof  that at the  time when the crime was  committed these appellants were  participating in an insurrection or in a seditious uprising against Spain or the United  States.  He was of opinion that the movement headed  by  Leocadio  Pajarillo, which  resulted in the overthrow of the  local municipal officers on  the day of the murder  was directed rather against  the government set up by the leaders of the insurrection than against the sovereignty of the United  States, and that it had for its object merely his  own material  profit, selfish aggrandizement, and political advancement  in the municipality where he resided.   From these premises the trial judge concluded that whatever political character the offenses committed on that occasion may have  had, it did  not bring them within the terms of the Amnesty Proclamation.</p>
  <p>"We think, however, that  under the liberal construction which should be given that  instrument, the offenses committed by Leocadio Pajarillo  and his partisans, which were incident  to their attempt to seize control of the municipal insurrectionary  government, must fairly be held to have 'resulted from internal political feuds or dissensions among the Filipinos themselves' during the insurrection  then pending, and that the participants in the overthrow of the local municipal insurrectionary governments  were at the same time participants in one of the insurrectionary movements against the United States contemplated in the proclamation. In applying  the provisions  of  the Amnesty Proclamation we have  never stopped to inquire to what degree particular leaders of the various insurrectionary movements may have been impelled by the lust of personal aggrandizement and political advancement, nor have we sought to discover the reasons for the 'internal political feuds or dissensions among the Filipinos themselves to which reference is made in the proclamation, provided it  affirmatively appears that such feuds or dissensions could fairly be characterized  as political.  We are of opinion,  therefore, that all that was done by Leocadio  Pajarillo and his partisans  on the day of the murder, which under the most  liberal construction of the evidence of record can be said to have been an incident to the movement to seize the local municipal officials and set up a new municipal government must fairly be held to be included within the provisions of the Amnesty Proclamation.</p>
  <p>"The question then presents itself, whether the  shooting of OcceÃ±o was or was not an incident of the political movement participated in by Leocadio Pajarillo and his partisans on the day the shooting took place.  This question, we think, must be  answered in the negative, and  in this conclusion we are agreed with the trial judge who rested his denial of the plea of amnesty not only on the ground that the political movement led by Leocadio Pajarillo was not such  a movement as  was contemplated in the Amnesty Proclamation, but that the shooting of Occeno had no political significance whatever, and was merely the outcome of a personal  difference with  the deceased.</p>
  <p>"Accepting as true all the evidence of  record, including the testimony of the witnesses for the defense, which tends to disclose that, on the day of the murder,  Leocadio Pajarillo was at the head of a movement looking  to the capture of the local municipal officers and the seizure of control of the local municipal government, and  accepting as true his claim that at that  time he was a member of the  branch of the insurrectionary forces known  as <i>macheteros</i>, and  that he joined  in the movement against the  local officials  because he had heard that  the acting president  of  the town was contemplating a surrender to the American forces,  we still do not think the evidence is sufficient to maintain a finding that the cold-blooded murder of OcceÃ±o was committed in furtherance of that movement.   None of the other officials were killed and it does not  appear that any attempt  was made to kill them.  Even the president, against whom it is alleged the suspicion  of disloyalty was especially directed, was merely captured, apparenlty for the purpose of bringing him before higher  authority for discipline, or at least to hold him in detention until his captors had secured control of the town.  Aside from the personal motive attributed to Leocadio Pajarillo by the  witnesses for the prosecution, no  reason  suggests itself or has  been  suggested for the adoption of extreme measures in the case of OcceÃ±o.   Navarra, whose soldiers  were placed at  the  disposition of Pajarillo on that occasion, testified that Pajarillo reported to him that OcceÃ±o had  been  shot while  attempting to escape, thus indicating that no excuse could' be found at that time for the deliberate shooting of the deceasad.  The shooting did not take place under the strain of excitement incident to the movement, or in the heat of an altercation arising out of the  unusual incidents  of  the day.  OcceÃ±o was shot unarmed at the cold, gray dawn of the day, in his own house, through his partially opened door, without being given an opportunity to recognize his assailants, much less to enter into a discussion with them,  or  to learn their object in attacking him.  The attacking party did not contain any of the revolutionary  soldiers who  were operating  under the orders of Leocadio Pajarillo, but consisted only of Pajarillo himself, his two brothers and his brother-in-law, and it is manifest that they had agreed upon his death before they sought him out at his home.  The evidence  strongly tends to disclose, if  it does not conclusively establish, the fact that the leader of that party was the paramour of the wife of the victim of the tragedy.   It is fair to assume that he had reason to fear the enmity  of the man he had wronged on the discovery of his  illicit relations with his wife.  In any  event  the  personal motive for the commission of the crime stands out strongly from the pages of the record, and nothing that  is contained therein justifies the conclusion that it was induced by any demand of political necessity or expediency.</p>
  <p>"We  are of opinion,  therefore, that the defendants  and appellants have  not shown that the crime which they committed was political in character; that, while it is true that it was committed on the occasion of an  internal dissension among Filipinos during the course of an  insurrection, it did not result from  such dissension,  and that these defendants and appellants are not, therefore, entitled to the benefits of the President's Proclamation of Amnesty."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The facts  proven  in the present case are  very similar to those proven in the Pajarillo case;  in this case, however,  there is a total lack of evidence of "the  personal motive for the commission of the crime" which was developed in the record  in the former case. Upon the evidence submitted in this case, and giving the defendants the benefit of any doubt which may arise  as to the political character of the raid described in the opinion  of the court below, we are of opinion that they must be held to  be entitled to  the benefit of the Amnesty Proclamation.   There is evidence in the record which at least tends to prove that some if not all of the property seized during the raid  was  ostensibly intended for the use and support  of the  soldiers and other adherents of  the revolutionary movement.</p>
<p>The sentence  imposed by the trial court should therefore  be and is hereby reversed,  and  the information  filed in this  case  should be  and is  hereby dismissed with  the costs  of this instance  <em>de  oficio</em>.  The defendants  and  appellants will be set at liberty forthwith.</p>
