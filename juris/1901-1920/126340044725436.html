				<H3>CLARA ALFONSO BUENAVENTURA, PETITIONER AND APPELLEE, VS. THE COMMANDING GENERAL OF THE DIVISION OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT AND APPELLANT.
  
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Judgment having been rendered in this case by the two judges of the Court of Land Registration,  S. del Rosario and D. R, Williams, there was no motion for a new trial, and by a bill of exceptions  and agreement  between the parties that there was no issue of fact between them, there was presented directly to this court the opposition of the commanding general of the Division of the Philippines to the petition  of Clara Alfonso Buenaventura that she be declared the owner of a parcel of land, with  the building thereon, situated on Corregidor Island,  Calles  Churruca and Colon No. 2, municipality of San Jose, with an area of 172.82 square meters.</p>
<p>The following facts are admitted by the contestant and stated in the judgment:  (1). "That the petitioner has been in possession of this land for more than thirty years, as shown by testimony at the trial, of herself  and  witnesses, and by the <em>expediente posesorio</em> recorded in the Registry o£ Property of Cavite on December 21, 1901."   (2) That "in spite of the ownership which she sets up, the petitioner, on the 15th  of  January, 1903, executed  against her will a contract of lease in favor of the commanding general of the Division of the Philippines of this land,  after a protest made on the 4th of said month in the municipal building of Corregidor Island and presented on  the  8th  to  the Civil Governor of the Islands."   (Bill of exceptions,  p. 2.)</p>
<p>The basis of the opposition is as follows: That all the land of Corregidor Island was declared a military reservation by the President of the United States in the executive order of April 16, 1902, and that all land declared by the President of the United States to be a military reservation is  not subject to  the legislative  action of the Philippine Commission,  nor to the effect of the laws  of said Commission, nor as a consequence is it within the jurisdiction of any class of courts in the Philippine Islands; it being assumed that all  military reservations are expressly excluded from  the control granted  to the Philippine Commission by the act of Congress of July 1,1902, section 12.</p>
<p>The trial  court sets out as the principal  basis of its decision in favor of the petitioner the following, literally quoted: "Sectioii 6 of Act No. 627 of the Civil Commission of these Islands enacted February 9 of last year  (1903) provides, that lands not exceeding 16 hectares, as is the case  herein, lying within military  reservations, may be acquired by ordinary ^prescription of ten years, even though they  may be considered public lands for failure to perfect their reduction to private ownership by 'composicion' with the Government in due time, in accordance with the legislation  then  in force concerning appropriation  of Government lands."  (Bill of  exceptions, p. 2.)</p>
<p>But the  contestant insists that  "the aforesaid  act of Congress nullifies all  those parts of the acts  of the Philippine Civil Commission Numbered 627,  496 enacted on the 6th of November, 1.902, and 809 enacted  on the 27th of July, 1903, that grant title's of ownership of land lying on Corregidor Island  to all those who had not titles perfected prior to April 11, 1902, or which were declared or confirmed  in a private  party subsequent  to  this date by the honorable court in pursuance of the legislation of the Philippine Civil Commission."  (Bill of exceptions, p. 3.)</p>
<p>The assignment of  errors  is limited to the following points: That the trial court erred in holding:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"1. That a possession of  thirty years authorizes  the registration of an absolute title in favor of the petitioner.</p>
  <p>"2. That ordinary  possession for  ten years authorizes the registration of a complete and sufficient title in favor of the petitioner.</p>
  <p>"3. That the '<em>informacion posesoria</em>' recorded in the Registry  of Property of Cavite on December 21, 1901, authorizes the registration of title in favor of the petitioner." It is very evident that the trial court did not err in any of these three respects; it did not take into consideration only a possession for ten years or for thirty years, nor only the '<em>expediente de information posesoria'</em> for the adjudication of the land and the certification of the title of ownership.  It took into consideration  that the applicant is a native of the Philippine Islands, that the land is not greater than 16 hectares in area, and the possession for more than ten years on the 13th of August, 1898, and has taken into account:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First. Section 14  of  the aforesaid act of Congress  of July 1,  1902, which  in  its second part reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The Philippine Commission is authorized to issue patents without compensation to any native of said Islands, conveying title to any tract of land not more than sixteen hectares in extent, which were public lands and had been actually occupied by  such native or his ancestors prior to and on the thirteenth of August, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Second.  Section 6 of Act No. 627 of the Philippine Commission, approved February 9, 1903,  is as follows: "The provisions of sections thirty-eight, thirty-nine, forty, forty-one, and forty-two of Act Numbered One hundred and ninety, entitled 'An Act providing a Code of Procedure  in Civil Actions and Special Proceedings in  the Philippine Islands,' are hereby made applicable to all lands not more than  sixteen hectares in extent within the limits of any military reservation, notwithstanding such lands would be public lands were it not for titles acquired in the manner stated in said sections thirty-eight, thirty-nine, forty, forty-one, and forty-two."   In short, land  of not more than 16 hectares in area within  a military reservation  may hereafter be  acquired  by  ten years' prescription, although because of its character as public land it could not heretofore have been acquired by prescriptive title.</p>
<p>This court has nothing to decide concerning the objections raised  to such  a  decision  of  the Court of Land Registration  in accordance throughout with the provisions of law, but the contention of  the contestant is that Act No. 627  of the Philippine Commission, upon which the court has based its decision, is contrary to section 12 of the act of Congress.</p>
<p>It will be well to quote this and the following sections referring to public lands:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"SEC. 12.  That all  the property and rights which may have been acquired in the Philippine Islands by the United States under the treaty  of peace  with Spain, signed December tenth, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, except such land or other property as shall be designated by the President of the United States for military and other reservations of the Government  of  the  United States, are hereby placed under the control of the Government of said Islands,  to be administered  for  the benefit  of the inhabitants thereof, except as provided in this act.</p>
  <p>"SEC. 13. That the Government of the Philippine Islands, subject to the provisions of this act and except as herein provided, shall classify according to its agricultural character and productiveness, and shall immediately make rules and regulations for the lease, sale, or other disposition of the public lands other than timber or mineral lands, but such rules and regulations shall not go into effect or  have the force of law until they have received the approval of the President, and when approved by the President  they shall be submitted by him to Congress at the beginning of the next ensuing session thereof and  unless disapproved or amended by Congress at said session they shall at the close of such period have the force and effect of law in the Philippine Islands: <em>Provided</em>, That a single homestead entry shall not exceed sixteen hectares in extent.</p>
  <p>"SEC. 14. That the Government "of the Philippine Islands is hereby authorized and empowered  to enact rules and regulations and to prescribe terms and conditions to enable persons to perfect their title to public lands in said Islands, who, prior to the transfer  of sovereignty from Spain to the United States, had fulfilled all or some of the conditions required by the Spanish laws and royal  decrees  of the Kingdom of Spain for the acquisition of legal title thereto, yet failed to secure conveyance of title; and the Philippine Commission is authorized, to issue patents, without  compensation, to any native of said Islands, conveying title to any tract of land not more than sixteen hectares in extent which were public  lands and had been actually  occupied by such native or his ancestors prior to and on  the  thirteenth of August, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There appears to us to be great weight in the argument contained in  the  following paragraphs  from  the brief herein filed by W. H. Lawrence, as <em>amicus curie</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Considering the question from another point of view, we reach the same conclusion.  Let us suppose, for the sake  of argument, that at the time when  the act of Congress of July 1, 1902, was passed, the land subject of the present action had not been converted from public domain to private property, and let it be admitted hypothetically that section  6 of Act No. 627 and paragraph 6 of section 54 of Act No. 926 should be interpreted,  not  as rules of evidence but as general grants of public lands.  As such grants they are valid and authorized by Congress.   This will clearly appear from a careful examination of sections 12, 13, and 14 of the Philippine Bill.   Section 12 excepts from  the general grant of pubjic lands to the Government of the Islands all those which the President may reserve for military purposes.  Section 13 provides for the alienation of such  public agricultural lands  as  are unoccupied and to which private parties have not acquired partial or imperfect rights.   Section 14 authorizes the Government of the Philippine Islands to perfect the titles of such persons as have  complied partially with the requirements for the grant of  public lands, and the titles of those natives whose mere possession antedates the 13th  day of August, 1898. </p>
  <p>"It is to be noted that in section 13 Congress prohibits the alienation of purely public lands within military reservations, using the phrase 'in accordance  with the provisions and limitations of this act while in section 14, which authorizes the completion of  inchoate  titles, there  is no mention of limitations or exceptions whatever.</p>
  <p>"The evident intention of Congress was to recognize three classes of lands in  these Islands: (1) Lands of private ownership; (2) lands of purely public character; and (3) lands occupied or claimed,  with some semblance of equity, by private parties, but in respect to which there exists no known grant  from the Government.  It was the purpose of Congress  to reserve a portion from the second class  for military purposes, and to convey  the rest  to the Government of £he Philippine Islands for the benefit of the people of the Islands.  With respect  to the third  class, Congress directed that patents should be  issued to the occupants who were established thereon or to persons who  had acquired equities therein, and that the  ownership  of such occupants and equitable owners  of said lands should be confirmed.  Section 54 of Act No. 926 and section 6 of Act No. 627 were intended to advance and  carry out this purpose, and  in ratifying Act No. 926, Congress, as  well as the President, confirmed  this  intention  and the  means adopted for carrying it into effect.</p>
  <p>"To assert  that Congress had the intention of  authorizing the  confirmation  of  inchoate titles in the  native residents of Bulacan and to refuse a like privilege to the residents of Corregidor Island is  to suppose unjust, illogical, unnatural, and very unequal  legislation, and to doubt the beneficent purposes of the American  nation  toward the Filipino people.  Some of the military reservations were  established before the Philippine bill was  passed, some have been chosen since that date, and it is probable that others will be selected hereafter.  Is it possible that Congress could have intended to destroy the possessory and equitable rights of occupants within the limits of  the old reservations and t6 confirm such  rights in favor of those who live on reservations  established  subsequent  to the date on which the law of public lands went into force? Can we attribute to Congress the intention of extending their favor .to some  Filipinos and of refusing it to others in like conditions, determining the selection by chance or in accordance with geographical limitations?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a matter of fact, within the  limits of a military reservation already established or to be established hereafter, there may be found land of private ownership, with a perfect and complete title, or land which has not yet passed to private ownership,  but  which is  in the  possession of  a private party, or  to which the private party has an  initial, imperfect,  and incomplete title.</p>
<p>There are two cases.  In  the first case, if within the limits  of a military reservation there  is land of private ownership with a perfect and complete title, the contestant himself recognizes  that  it can  not be comprised  in the reservation, for in his brief he  says that the laws of the Philippine Commission are ineffectual to confer titles of ownership of land situated  on Corregidor Island "upon those who had not <em>absolute</em> titles prior to the 11th day of April, 1902;" from which it may be inferred that such laws would not be ineffectual if the titles were <em>absolute</em>, and consequently that the Philippine Commission is competent to enact laws providing that when a military reservation is announced, an owner of land comprised therein may object to its being included.  For this purpose,  it is provided in Act No. 627  that  the Governor-General  give due notice of the reservation to the judge of the Court of Land Registration, advising him that all lands, buildings, and rights in real property of private parties included within the described  boundaries (of the reservation) must immediately be brought within the law of registration of property and be  registered as  such  law  provides (sec.  2).  And  in section  1 it is provided that such lands "as are not declared public lands shall be registered in  accordance with said law."  This  is the first application of the control or administration which the Congress of the United States has granted to the Government of the .Philippine Islands.</p>
<p>The treaty of Paris not only safeguarded the right of ownership, but also such  rights as pertain in  accordance with law to the peaceful possessor of property of all kinds, and Congress in the said law, in the second paragraph of section 14, authorized the Philippine Commission—and this is the second  case—to convert possession into  ownership, or, in other words, "to issue patents without compensation to any native of said Islands, conveying title to any tract of land not more than sixteen  hectares  in extent which were public lands and had been  actually occupied by such native or his ancestors prior to and  on the thirteenth day of August, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight."   Public land "before and on the thirteenth day of August, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight,"  was  public  land  before the treaty of Paris and before any military  reservation, and yet possession of this public land on or before the 13th of August, 1898, was  sufficient  so that after the act of Congress it might be converted into private property and excluded from  any reservation which  might be established.</p>
<p>If for the sole reason of  being now found within the limits of a military reservation, land is free from the control and disposition of the Insular Government, we are unable to understand how the Insular Government or the Philippine Commission can carry into force the provisions of the act of Congress contained in the three sections above quoted.</p>
<p>With like effect as possession existing on or before the 13th  of August, 1898, Congress has taken into consideration the applications for titles to public lands presented before the  change of sovereignty and  which  were then pending award or "<em>composicion</em>" or issuance  of  patent, such  applications, being prior to the treaty of  Paris and before the possibility of any reservation, and  being  considered by Congress an initial right or an imperfect title, in accordance with section 14 of the act of Congress, might be perfected and converted into an effective right and a perfect title of ownership.  It is not only those public lands which remain after deducting the assignments for military reservations or for other purposes which fall within the control or  administration  of the Insular  Government. Even such public lands  as are found within the limits of a reservation, military or otherwise, if on or  before the 13th day of August they  were in possession of a native and did not exceed 16 hectares  in area, fall or remain under the control and administration of the Insular Government, in order that the Philippine Commission may,  in  accordance  with  the law of Congress,  exclude them from such reservation and issue with respect to them free patents or certificates of ownership.</p>
<p>Therefore, the final exception  of section 12, "except as provided in this act," is  not the same exception contained in the foregoing text of the section, "except such as shall be designated for  military  reservations," etc., but refers to the exceptions  or limitations contained  in  the other sections of the act relative  to public lands.</p>
<p>In addition to the  right of ownership and the right of possession  and other rights in real  property of private character safeguarded by the treaty of Paris, Congres&amp;has placed at the disposition and under the control  of  the Insular Government of the Philippines, to be converted into a right of private ownership, the actual visible possession on or before the 13th of August, 1898, and the right to a title or title unperfected at the time of  the  change of sovereignty, this possession and right existing prior to the treaty of Paris, by virtue of the act of Congress, established as private the public lands conveyed by Spain to the United States in said treaty.  Thus it is that  the action and the powers of the Government and of the Commission embrace all the public lands in the Philippine Islands,  so that by means  of laws and orders there may  be carried out the intention of Congress that from the public  lands  which are to  constitute reservations, military or otherwise, as well as from the rest which are to be at the free disposition and administration of the Insular Government, there may be segregated those parts of the public lands to which there is proven either a right of possession or an application for title prior to the change of sovereignty.</p>
<p>We therefore affirm in all respects the judgment appealed from.   So ordered.</p>

<em>DISSENTING</em></div>
<p><strong>CARSON, J.:</strong></p>
<p>I dissent.</p>
<p>This  is an application for adjudication and registration of  a certain tract of land and improvements  thereon, under the provisions of Act No. 496, known as "The Land Registration Act."</p>
<p>There is no dispute as to'the facts, and the decision of the Court of Land Registration is reported directly to this court under the provisions of section 14 of Act No. 496.</p>
<p>The  following  are the pertinent facts as found by the trial court, and under the provisions of section 14 of Act No. 496 are the facts of the case as submitted to this court for its consideration: (1)  That the applicant had been in possession of the land in question for more that thirty years prior to the institution of these proceedings, as shown by the testimony  of herself and her  witnesses,  and by the possessory proceedings (<em>expediente posesorio</em>) recorded in the Registry of Property in Cavite on December 21, 1901; (2)  that this land is situated on the Island of Corregidor and is less that 16 hectares in extent; (3) that the entire Island of Corregidor was set apart and reserved for military purposes by the President of the United States under an order dated the 11th day of April, 1902; (4)  that the land in question  before being reduced to possession  by the applicant or her predecessors in interest  was public agricultural land.</p>
<p>It  is contended that the title to the land in question should be adjudicated and registered in favor  of the applicant as against the Government of the United States by virtue of—</p>
<p>(1) Possession  for thirty years, that being the period prescribed by Spanish law for the acquirement of prescriptive title to real estate;</p>
<p>(2) Presumed grant;</p>
<p>(3) Registry of applicant's possessory proceedings  in the Registry of Property for the Province of  Cavite  on December 21,1901;</p>
<p>(4) The provisions of section 6 of Act No.  627 of the Philippine Commission;</p>
<p>(5) The provisions of subsection  6, section  54 of Act No. 926 of the Philippine Commission; and</p>
<p>(6) The provisions of the treaty of Paris.</p>
<p>I am of opinion that the judgment of the lower court can not be sustained on any of these grounds and that title  to the  land in question  has  never vested in the applicant.</p>
<p>(1) and (2): The invalidity of  the applicant's claim of title based upon either the first or second grounds, appears to be conclusively settled by the as yet unpublished decision  of this court in the case of Mateo Cariño <em>vs</em>. The Insular Government,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> No. 2746, rendered December 6, 1906, as will appear from the following citations:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The petitioner  presented  no documentary evidence  of title,  except a  possessory information obtained in  1901. By the provisions  of the Mortgage Law under  which this possessory information was obtained (art. 394) it produced only those effects which the laws give to mere possession.</p>
  <p>"The petitioner  not having shown any title from the Government, and the  land being agricultural, the case is governed by the decisions of  this court in the cases  of Valenton <em>vs</em>. Murciano<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> (2  Off. Gaz., 434), Cansino <em>vs</em>. Valdez<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> (4 Off. Gaz,, 488), and Tiglao <em>vs</em>.  The Insular Government<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> (4 Off.  Gaz., 747).  In  these cases it was held that mere possession of  land such as that in controversy  in this case  would not give  the  possessor any title thereto as against the Government.  In other words, that the  statute of limitations did not  run against the Government.  In other words, that the statute  of  limitations did not run  against the State in  reference to its agricultural lands.</p>
  <p>"The petitioner,  however,  insists  that  although  the statute of limitations as such did not run against the Government of Spain in the Philippine  Islands, yet a grant is to be conclusively presumed from immemorial use and occupation.  To say that the presumption of a grant is a presumption of law is, in our opinion, simply to say that it amounts to a statute of limitations; and  for a court to hold that the statute of limitations does  not run against the  Government as to its public agricultural lands, and at the same time to hold that if a person has been in possession of such lands for thirty years it is conclusively presumed that the Government had given him a deed therefor, would be to make two rulings directly inconsistent with each other. </p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
  <p>"The petitioner relies upon the case of The United States <em>vs</em>. Chaves (159 U.  S., 452)  and the case of The United States <em>vs</em>. Chaves (175 U.  S., 509).   In the case of Uaye <em>vs</em>. The United States  (175 U. S., 248) the court said at page 261:</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
  <p>" 'But this presumption is subject to the limitation that where  title is claimed  from a deed which is shown to be void, it will be presumed that  there was an independent grant (Smith  <em>vs</em>. Highbee, 12  Vt., 113),,or where surrounding circumstances are inconsistent with the theory of a grant.   (Townsend <em>vs</em>. Downer, 32 Vt., 183.)</p>
  <p>" 'The substance of the doctrine is that lapse of time may be treated as helping out the presumption of a grant, but where a void grant is shown it affords no presumption that another valid grant was made.  Nor does such presumption arise if the surrounding circumstances are incompatible with  the existence  of a  grant.  In the case under consideration we can not find any evidence which justifies us in believing that a legal grant can have been made, and under those circumstances we can not consider possession since the date of the treaty as dispensing with the requirements that the title, if not perfect at that time, was one which the claimant would have had a lawful right to make perfect, had the territory not  been acquired by the United States.'</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
  <p>"But in any event, and whatever the law may be elsewhere, it seems  clear that this doctrine of presumptive grant can not apply  to the Philippines in view of the Spanish legislation  for the Indies.   From time  to time there were promulgated laws which required the persons in possession of public lands to exhibit their  titles or grants thereto.   If these titles or grants were found to be good, they were confirmed, but if they were not, or. if the persons had  no titles or grants at all,  they  were evicted from the land.   For example, in law 14, title 12, book 4, Compilation  of the Laws of the Indies, it is stated:</p>
  <p>" 'We therefore order and command that all viceroys and presidents of pretorial courts designate, at such times as shall to them seem most expedient, a suitable period within which all possessors of tracts, farms,  plantations, and estates shall  exhibit to them and to the court officers appointed by them for this purpose their title deeds thereto. And those who  are in possession by virtue of proper deeds and receipts,  or by virtue of just prescriptive rights, shall be protected,  and all the rest shall be restored to us to be disposed of at our will.'</p>
  <p>"In the royal cedula of October 15,1754, it was provided 'that any and all persons who, since the year 1700, and  up to the date of the promulgation and publication of said order, shall have occupied royal lands, whether or not the same shall be cultivated or tenanted, may, either in person or through their attorneys or representatives, appear and exhibit to said subdelegates the titles and patents by virtue of which said lands  are occupied.   Said subdelegates will designate as the period within which such documents must be presented a term  sufficient in length and proportionate to the distance the interested party may have to travel for the purpose of making the presentation.  Subdelegates will at the time warn the parties interested that in case of their failure to present their title deeds within the term design nated, without a just and valid reason therefor,  they will be deprived of and evicted from their lands, and they will be granted to others.'</p>
  <p>"In the regulations of June 25,1880, it was provided as follows:</p>
  <p>"'ART. 8. If the interested  parties shall not ask an adjustment of the lands whose possession they are unlawfully enjoying within the  time of one year, or, the adjustment having been granted by the authorities, they shall fail to fulfill their obligation in connection with the compromise by paying the proper sum into the treasury, the latter will, by virtue of the authority vested in it, reassert the ownership of the State over the lands, and will, after fixing the value thereof, proceed to sell at public auction that part of the same which, either because it may have been reduced to cultivation  or is not located within  the forest zone, is not deemed advisable to preserve  as  the State forest reservations.'</p>
  <p>"In the royal decree of the 13th of February, 1894, published in  the Official Gazette of  Manila on the 17th  of April, 1894, it is provided in article 4 as follows:</p>
  <p>" 'ART.  4. The absolute title to  all agricultural land which may have been capable of composition (<em>compocision</em>) with the  State under the royal decree of the 25th, of June, 1880, in  any  case where such composition has  not been petitioned for at the date upon which this decree shall be promulgated in the Gazette of Manila, will be understood as having reverted to the State.  In no manner or time will any claim prevail which might be formulated for such lands by those who may have been in position for composition without having undertaken to do so prior to the date indicated.'</p>
  <p>"In  view of these provisions of the law, it seems to us impossible to say that as to  the public agricultural lands in the Philippines there existed a conclusive presumption after a lapse of thirty or any other  number of years that the  Government of Spain had granted to the possessor thereof a legal title thereto."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(3): That the issuance and registry of a possessory information in 1901  gave to the applicant no new or additional right in the land in question and did not vest title in her will be manifest from a consideration of the nature and effect of these proceedings and the provisions of the  Mortgage Law touching this subject-matter.   "Possessory informations" are granted in ex pwrte proceedings before a justice of the peace or other local official  of  like category, without notice except as to adjacent land holders,, and are always granted "without prejudice to third persons ;" their registry serves only as notice of the fact that such proceedings were ha4, and "prejudices or favors third persons only with  regard to the  effects which the laws attribute to possession."   In  the case of Pablo B. Trinidad <em>vs</em>. Lucas Ricafort et al.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> (5 Off. Gaz., 196), this court made use of the following language:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The defendant, Antonio Boncan, on the 11th of November,  1904, bought from the defendant, Lucas Ricafort,  one of the tracts of land described in the complaint for  the sum of 1,300 pesos,  there being recorded in the deed  the right of the vendor to purchase the property within two years from the said date, and the defendant, Boncan, claims that when he bought this piece of property the possessory information therein referred  to had  been inscribed in  the Registry of Property in the  name of Lucas Ricafort,  his vendor, and that in making the purchase he relied upon such information.   We have seen that at the time Lucas Ricafort was not, in fact,  the owner of all the property conveyed by him to the defendant, Boncan, and the question is? What effect had the inscription of the possessory information in his name upon the rights of the other heirs of Doroteo Ricafort?</p>
  <p>"Article 33 of the Mortgage Law provides  as follows:</p>
  <p>'The record of instruments or contracts which are null in accordance with the law are not validated thereby.'</p>
  <p>"Article 34 of the same  law provides that a purchaser from one who appears  from the registry to be the owner of the property acquires, under certain  circumstances,  a good title thereto, although the vendor may not be,  in fact, the owner.</p>
  <p>"That part of the article so providing can have no application to this case because in the same article is found the following statement: 'The provisions of this article may at no time be applied to the instrument recorded in accordance with the provisions  of article 390, unless the, prescription has validated or secured the interest referred to therein.'</p>
  <p>"Moreover, article 394 of tne same law provides in part as follows: 'Entries of possession shall prejudice or favor third persons from the date of their record, but only with regard  to the  effects which the law attributes to mere possession.'</p>
<p>"The defendant, Boncan, is therefore not protected by the fact that a possessory information was inscribed in the Registry of Property in the name of his grantor." </p></blockquote>
  <p>Article 389 of the Mortgage Law makes it a condition precedent to the presentation in court of any document affecting real estate that it  be recorded in the Registry of Property.  So few titles of  ownership were recorded, and the practical difficulties in securing registry were so great that articles 390 and 394 of the law provided for the registry of  mere physical possession, and permitted the introduction in evidence of entries of "possessory proceedings" had in accordance with the rules therein prescribed. As is shown above, however,  such proceedings confer no title whatever upon the applicant, and their only effect is to enable him to record subsequent transactions affecting his right in the property,  to  present the record of those proceedings in evidence, and to maintain his prescriptive title when possession ripens into ownership after the lapse of the prescriptive period prescribed by law.</p>

<p>It  is manifest, therefore, that the registry of these proceedings is  no more  than an annotation of  applicant's possession of the property, and gives to her  no title as against the State either at the date of such annotation or at any time thereafter.</p>
<p>(4): Title to the land in question did not vest  in the applicant by virtue of the enactment of section  6 of Act No. 627, because the Philippine Commission did  not have authority thus to dispose of public  lands—that  is, lands of the United States—situated within a military reservation  which had been designated by  the President of  the United States prior to the enactment of that act.</p>
<p>It is not contended that the  Philippine Commission had any authority to dispose of the lands or property of the United States in the Philippine Islands other  than by Tirtue of "the Philippine bill," an act of Congress enacted July  1,1902.  Section 12 of that act is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"That all the property and rights which may have been acquired in the Philippine Islands by the United States under the  treaty of peace  with Spain,  signed December tenth, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, except such land or other property as shall be designated by the President of the United States for military and other reservations of the Government of the United States, are, hereby placed under the control of the Government of said Islands, to be administered for the  benefit  of the inhabitants thereof, except as provided in this act."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The exception of land  or other property of the United States within military  reservations,.from land and other property of the United States placed under control of the Government of these Islands, is so explicit and so sweeping in its terms that it would seem to preclude discussion.</p>
<p>This section  contains the  general  grant of control over lands and other property of the United States upon which the Government of the Philippine Islands must ultimately rely in undertaking to administer all such  property, and the remaining sections of the act dealing with this subject-matter are no more than additional limitations and restrictions upon the general grant and directions as to how it should be exercised.</p>
<p>It is said, however, that the authority of the  Philippine Commission to administer and control the land in question and to vest title therein in the applicant is to be found in section 14 of the act.</p>
<p>Section  14 of the Philippine bill is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"That the Government of the Philippine Islands is hereby authorized and empowereft  to enact rules and regulations and to prescribe terms and conditions  to enable persons to perfect their  titles to public lands  in  said Islands, who, prior to the transfer of sovereignty from Spain to the United States, had fulfilled all or some of the  conditions required by the  Spanish laws and royal decrees of the Kingdom of Spain for Jthe acquisition of legal title thereto, yet failed to secure conveyance of title; and the Philippine Commission is authorized to  issue patents,  without compensation,  to  any native of said Islands, conveying title to any tract of land not more  than  sixteen hectares  in extent, which were public  lands and had been actually occupied by such native or  his ancestors prior  to and  on the thirteenth of August, eighteen  hundred and ninety-eight."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is contended that the provisions of the first paragraph of this section are in no wise dependent on the general grant of authority in section 12 or limited by the exception as to military reservations  contained  therein, because  as it is said the lands to which it refers are not in fact public lands in the true sense of the word, but  lands in which the occupant has acquired an equitable title as against the Government by virtue of long continued or immemorial possession  or otherwise.  But I think it has been shown in accordance with the general doctrine laid down by this court in such  cases, that the mere possession  of  public agricultural lands for however long a period of time prior to the transfer of sovereignty from Spain to the United States does not give the occupant an equitable or an imperfect title as against the United States; and therefore even were we to admit the authority of tfre Commission to vest title in occupants of public lands within  military reservations, under  the provisions of the first  paragraph of this section, the applicant in this case can not set up a claim by virtue of such legislation.</p>
<p>But it is contended that even though that portion of section 14 of the Philippine bill which authorizes the enactment of rules for the perfecting of titles did not authorize the Commission to vest title  in the applicant  under the provisions of section 6 of Act No. 627, such authority may be found in the latter part of said section 14 which provides for the issuance of patents to tracts of land not,more than 16 hectares in extent to natives in possession of public lands prior to or on the 13th of August, 1898.</p>
<p>The provisions  of this section touching free patents are in no wise a recognition of a right in the settler, and are in truth a generous  gift to those native inhabitants of these Islands who are benefited  thereby.  If they had  been intended as a recognition of a  right, they would not have been limited to  tracts not more than 16  hectares in extent, nor denied to claimants other than native settlers.</p>
<p>It can not be contended therefore that the lands affected by these provisions  are not lands of the United States in the sense in which those words are used in  section 12 of the act, nor that  Congress "having in mind the equitable or imperfect titles of the  occupants, could  not have intended" to limit  these provisions of section 14 by the exception contained in the general grant.</p>
<p>The reasons of public policy which dictated the retention of <em>direct</em> control  in the hands of the Government of the United States of lands and property of the United States within military reservations are  so apparent  that it does not seem necessary  to set  them out at this  time, but in construing this statute it is proper and necessary that these reasons should be kept clearly in mind.  Reading section 14 together with section 12, I am unable to discover any reason why the lands mentioned therein should be held to be unaffected by the express exception contained  in  the general grant as to lands of the United States situated within military reservations.</p>
<p>I am of opinion, moreover, that the authority to grant free patents to "public lands" contained in  section 14 of the act of Congress could not be interpreted so as to authorize the Commission to grant a free patent to lands within a military reservation, even though no express restriction was contained in the act itself.</p>
<p>The words "public lands"  are habitually used  in our legislation to describe those lands  belonging to  the Government which are subject to sale or  other disposition (Newhall <em>vs</em>. Sanger, 92 U.S.,  761); "there is a clear distinction between public lands and lands that have been severed from the public domain and reserved from sale or other disposition under general laws.  Such  a reservation severs the land reserved from the  mass of the  public domain, and appropriates it to a particular use.  *  *  * The reservation of the lands in question is therefore a disposal of them, so far as the public domain is concerned." (U. S. <em>vs</em>. The Tigh Valley Land and Live-Stock Company, 76 Fed. Rep., 693, 694)</p>
<p>Laws relating to public lands do not extend  to lands which have been previously appropriated or reserved for special uses, unless they are specifically mentioned in the law itself; and whenever a tract of land has been once legally appropriated to any purpose, from that moment the land  thus appropriated  becomes severed from the mass  of public lands; <em>and no subsequent law or proclamation with reference to the public lands shall be construed to embrace it or to operate upon it.</em> (See Wilcox <em>vs</em>. Me-Connel, 13 Pet., 498, 513; 26  Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, pp. 222-223, and cases there cited.)</p>
<p>The Island of Corregidor was designated as a military reservation prior to the enactment of the act of Congress under which the applicant claims a right to a free patent. Section 14 of that act contains  no specific provision making it operative as to the land to which she claims title, or to any of the public land within the military reservation on Corregidor Island; hence in accordance with the doctrine laid down in  the above-cited authorities, its  provisions could  not be held to embrace these lands, even  were we to hold that  the express exception contained in section 12 is not  applicable thereto.</p>
<p>(5): The reasons advanced for denying to the  Commission authority  to vest title in the applicant to lands of the United States  within a military reservation by virtue of section 6 of Act No. 627 apply with  equal force to the provisions of subsection 6 of section 54  of Act No. 926; and pf course the implied approval of Congress of this latter act can  not  be taken as giving new or additional force and effect  to any  part  thereof which  is  in conflict  with or unauthorized by the Philippine bill.</p>
<p>(6): That the  treaty of Paris gave  the  claimant any higher or better right to possession or ownership in the land in  question than .she had prior thereto is not borne out  by the provisions of article 8  of that treaty, which declares that "property  or rights which by law belong to the peaceful possession of property of  all kinds" shall not be impaired,  but does not give the possessor any higher or better  right than he had prior to the transfer of sovereignty. As we have seen, the applicant had no claim of title whatever as against the former sovereign and therefore she has no such  claim  against the new sovereign  unless  it be by virtue of something arising after the ratification of the treaty.</p>
I have discussed the questions involved  in this application at some  length, because it appears that this  is a test case, the decision of which  is to determine the actions of the respondent in regard to a great  number of similar applications  throughout the  Islands,  and for the  same reason I have  quoted extensively from decisions of this court  which  have not yet been published, instead of referring to them by  title and number.   In conclusion, it may not  be improper for  me to observe that while I am convinced of the right of the Government of the United States to reserve to itself full, complete, and dweeb control of all public  lands  within military reservations and that  such right has in fact been exercised, I do not accept the gratuitous assumption of counsel for the  applicant that the Government will be any less just or less generous in its treatment of native settlers upon its military reservations than is the Government of the Philippines in its treatment of native  settlers upon  those public lands over which  it lawfully exercises its delegated authority.<br>
