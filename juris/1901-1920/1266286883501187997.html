				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. GERVASIO GUMARANG AND TORIBIO GUMARANG, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>TRENT, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal by Gervasio Gumarang and Toribio Gumarang from a judgment 
of the Court of First Instance of the Province of Isabela convicting them of the 
theft of a carabao.<br><p><br>The appellants insist that the court erred: (1) In 
finding them guilty of the crime charged; and (2) in finding that the carabao 
supposed to have been lost or stolen was the property of Francisco 
Tumaliuan.</p>
<p>Francisco Tumaliuan testified that his carabao, valued at P220, was stolen on 
November 27, 1911; that on Wednesday he discovered the head, feet, and a portion 
of the hide of the animal; that on December 2, 1911, when he was on his way to 
attend a wedding at a house to the east of the house of Gervasio Gumarang he saw 
some of the meat of his carabao; that he then went to a neighboring house and 
told Vicente Mallillin that he had eaten some of his carabao at the house of 
Gervasio Gumarang ; that Vicente laughed and told him, "Here are the horns of 
the carabao I cut off when I went to help kill that carabao;" that the meat was 
found oh the fence at the house of Gervasio Gumarang where it had been placed to 
dry; that he could positively identify the head, horns, and pieces of the hide 
which he discovered; that he knew they were from his carabao because he had the 
animal in his possession every day before it was stolen; that he did not yet 
have a certificate of ownership for the animal in his own name, but that he 
secured the animal from Florencio Fulgan, haying traded some land for it; and 
that he was about to have the certificate of transfer made at the time the 
animal was stolen.</p>
<p>Isidro Mesa, a councilman, testified that on December 2, 1911, Tumaliuan 
reported to him concerning the loss of his carabao and the finding of the bones, 
horns, and meat; that he made an investigation; that he, the lieutenant of the 
barrio, Francisco Tumaliuan, and Eufrosina Mallillin went to the house where the 
meat was found, and found some meat on the fence of Gervasio Gumarang; that he 
then called the justice of the peace and a policeman to the place where the meat 
was and turned the meat over to them. The witness further testified that without 
the use of force, violence, or intimidation, Vicente Mallillin confessed that he 
had helped the other defendants kill the carabao of Francisco Tumaliuan, and 
that the pieces of horn found in Vicente's house exactly fitted the stubs of the 
horns of the head found by Francisco.</p>
<p>Eufrosina Mallillin and Aurea Balisi testified to having seen the two 
appellants in possession of carabao meat shortly after the time that Vicente 
Mallillin confessed to have assisted them, the appellants, in killing the 
offended party's carabao.<br><br>Vicente Mallillin, who was charged in the same 
complaint but was later excluded on motion of the fiscal to be used as a witness 
for the prosecution, testified that he and the two appellants killed the carabao 
of Francisco Tumaliuan on November 27, 1911; that Gervasio Gumarang arrived 
about 9 o'clock at night of that day with the carabao which he said had been 
taken from the offended party's barrio; that he, the witness, was invited to 
help kill it; that his house was about 60 yards distant from the house of 
Gervasio; that he did not see the brand of the animal, but that he knew it was 
Francisco's, as he was very familiar with it because the animal was for some 
time very close to his house.</p>
<p>The defense at first attempted to prove that a carabao of the appellants had 
recently died and that they had used the meat. The intention evidently was to 
show that the meat found on the fence, was that of the animal which died from 
disease. This course was finally abandoned, as Gervasio Gumarang absolutely 
denied that any meat was found in his possession. Vicente Mallillin, an 
accomplice, testified positively that the appellants stolie the carabao, and he 
was fully corroborated in all essential details. The guilt of the appellants of 
having stolen and killed a carabao is therefore established beyond question of a 
doubt.</p>
<p>In support of their second assignment of error, appellants' counsel quote 
from section 8 of Act No. 1147, which pro vides that the certificate of 
ownership therein provided for shall be <em>prima facie</em> evidence that the 
animal is the property of the person therein named as owner.<br><br>Counsel also 
quote section 22 of the same Act, which provides: "No transfer of large cattle 
shall be valid unless registered and a certificate of transfer secured as herein 
provided."</p>
<p>It is a well-settled principle of law that a material variance between the 
allegations and the proof as to the ownership of the stolen property in cases of 
larceny is fatal to a conviction. (Underwood <em>vs.</em> State, 72 Ala., 220; 
King <em>vs.</em> State, 44 Ind., 285; Jones<em> vs.</em> Com., 17 Gratt., Va., 
563; State <em>vs.</em> Wilson, 6 Ore., 428.) The legal title to the stolen 
carabao in the case under consideration was not in Francisco Tumaliuan, but he, 
Francisco, was in the lawful possession of the animal. He held the carabao by 
right of his contract of purchase.</p>
<p>In the case of Fowler<em> vs.</em> State (100 Ala., 96) Thomas J. Fowler was 
convicted of the theft of an ox alleged to belong to Charles L. Phillips, The 
evidence tended, to prove that Phillips had purchased the ox from Malone &amp; 
Collins. On cross-examination Phillips was asked, "if it was not the 
understanding at the time he got the ox from Malone &amp; Collins that he should 
keep the oxen until fall, and that if he was able to pay for them he was to take 
them; otherwise, he was to pay rent on them to Malone &amp; Collins." To this 
question the witness answered in the affirmative. He was then asked "if he had 
ever paid Malone &amp; Collins for the oxen, or offered to pay them for the 
same." The State objected to this question, the court sustained the objection, 
and the defendant duly excepted.</p>
<p>In deciding the case on appeal the supreme court of Alabama said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It was immaterial whether Phillips had paid, or offered to pay, Malone &amp; 
Collins for the oxen or not. If he was in possession of them, at the time of the 
alleged larceny, either as a conditional purchaser or a bailee, the ownership 
was properly laid in him."</p></blockquote>
<p>The subject of the allegation and proof of ownership in cases of larceny is 
discussed in 25 Cyc, and on page 91 thereof is the following comment: "Any legal 
interest in the goods, although less than the absolute title, will support an 
allegation of ownership. But there must be an actual legal interest, not a mere 
claim or expectation of interest. Thus a seller who has delivered the goods 
cannot be described as owner merely because negotiations are pending between him 
and the buyer for canceling the sale. So claiming ownership and attempting 
without success to do acts of ownership is not enough to justify a description 
as owner. The ostensible ownership is, however, enough to justify the 
description. So far as the thief is concerned, he cannot question the title of 
the apparent owner."</p>
<p>On pages 89 and 90 in Cyc, vol. 25, under the heading, "Who should be laid as 
owner," we find the following: "The actual condition of the legal title is 
immaterial to the thief; so far as he is concerned, one may be taken as the 
owner who was in peaceable possession of it, and whose possession was unlawfully 
disturbed by the taking. The possessor of the goods from whom the thief took 
them may therefore properly be described as owner in the indictment. The 
possession must be actual; right of possession alone will not suffice. Nor a 
general direction and control, not amounting to a legal possession. The goods 
need not be in the actual manual possession of the person described as owner at 
the moment of taking; it is enough that he was legally the possessor. Upon this 
principle the property of goods stolen may be laid in a bailee from whom they 
were taken, as for instance in a common carrier, an innkeeper, a pledgee, a 
receiver, a hirer or borrower, a <em>cestui que trust,</em> one in possession 
under a contract for purchase, a washer woman who has the goods to wash, or a 
coachmaker who has a coach to repair, or a lienor, a manufacturer who is 
performing work on the materials of another, a cashier of a bank, or a constable 
who has attached or taken the goods in execution."</p>
<p>Although the actual legal title to the stolen carabao may not have been in 
Francisco Tumaliuan, he was the peaceable possessor of the animal by reason of 
having purchased the same from Florencio Fulgan, By reason of this purchase, 
accompanied with the actual possession, Tumaliuan had a real or legal interest 
in the animal. The actual condition of the legal title was immaterial in so far 
as the appellants are concerned. They took the animal from the actual possession 
of Tumaliuan, the apparent owner. They cannot now be heard to say that Tumaliuan 
was not the owner.</p>
<p>The penalty imposed by the trial court is not the penalty provided by law for 
the offense committed. The carabao stolen was valued at P220; hence, according 
to arts. 518 and 520 of the Penal Code, as amended by Act No. 2030, the proper 
penalty to be imposed upon the appellants is the penalty next higher in degree 
than <em>arresto mayor</em> in its medium degree to <em>presidio 
corressional</em> in its minimum degree, which is <em>presidio correctional</em> 
in its medium degree to <em>presidio mayor</em> in the minimum degree. There 
being present no aggravating or mitigating circumstances, the medium degree of 
the proper penalty must be imposed. The judgment appealed from is therefore 
modified by substituting four years two months and one day, <em>presidio 
correctional</em>, in lieu of the two years eleven months and eleven days 
imposed by the trial court. In all other respects the judgment is affirmed, with 
costs against the appellants.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Carson</em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em>Moreland, J.,</em> concurs in the result.</p>
