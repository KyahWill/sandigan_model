				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> About  8 o'clock p. m. on the 16th of June, 1902, the defendants,  Guillermo  Laureaga, Damaso  Jose,  Domingo Paseual,  Andres Pascual, Marcos  Peralta, and Eulalio de Ocampo,  of whom the latter died subsequently of cholera, one of  them  armed with a gun and  the others with bolos, went to the  barrio of Quinamatayan-Cabayo, in the town of San Miguel de Mayumo, and proceeded to kidnap from their respective houses  Luis Ramos,  Francisco Ramos, Elias de  los Santos, Clemente Beltran, Meliton  Mallari, Inocencio David, Mauricio Ventura, Felix de los Santos, Agustin Maniquis,  and Aniceto de los Santos.  These people were taken by the accused to the town of Gapang, of the Province of Nueva Ecija.   The persons kidnaped were not informed of the cause of their detention.  Their aggressors were not officers or agents of the authorities.   On the road, in the course of an hour, the greater part of the persons kidnaped were released, only three of them, named Agnstin Maniquto, Luis Kamos, and Aniceto  de los Santos continuing to he deprived of their liberty.  The sequestration of these continued until 8 o'clock at night on the following day, at which time they were found in the barrio of Sania Cruz in the  town of Bulacan,  by Constabulary Inspector Jose Reyes, who set them at liberty, and captured the gun which was in possession of one of the accused.</p>
<p> The five defendants upon being arraigned pleaded not guilty.   Two  of  them, Domingo Pascual and Guillermo Laureaga, who were  recognized by four of the persons kidnaped,  alleged that they knew nothing about  the  facts alleged against them. Notwithstanding the denial of the defendants, and especially that  of  the two  last referred  to, four  eyewitnesses testified that  Laureaga was one of the kidnapers, and  two witnesses also testified that the other  defendants, Diimiiso Jose, Domingo Pascual, Andres Pascual, Marcos Peralta, and Eulalio Ocampo accompanied Laureaga.<br>
  <br>
  The commission of the  crime of illegally  detaining ten persons is therefore an unquestionable fact.  The purpose which the defendants  had in  committing this  offense against personal  liberty does not appear.  The detention of those who were longest held by the prisoners exceeded twenty-four hours.  Therefore the offense which the record shows to have been committed falls within  the last paragraph of article  481 of the Penal Code.  The  five defendants here present, together with the  deceased, Ocampo, are the proven  authors by direct participation of  this crime.  The aggravating circumstances of noctivrnity being present, and no mitigating circumstance concurring, the defendants should be sentenced to the maximum  period of the penalty of jmsion correctional in its minimum and medium degrees.  The judgment appealed should therefore be affirmed.<br>
  <br>
  With  respect to the defects which, according  to  the counsel for the defendants,  exist in the information filed against them by the provincial fiscal, these defects are not of substance, nor do they affect any of the essential rights of the accused, but are merely defects of form.  Therefore the information is sufficient, and no error exists for which the judgment should be annulled,  The information is sufficiently explicit  to enable one to immediately understand that the crime  was committed within the jurisdiction of  the  Court of  First  Instance of Bulacan, within whose territory lies the town of San Miguel de Mayumo; that the offense charged in the information is the crime of illegally detaining the ten persons mentioned, committed at one time, in the same place, and by the six accused, who committed this crime  jointly by common agreement, and perhaps with some purpose common to all  of  them,  but which,  however, has not  been made to appear.   Furthermore this  objection was not raised in the court below by the defendants.  It further appears from the information that the crime was  commenced and consummated in  the Province of  Bulacan, and continued in Nueva Ecija, to which province three of the prisoners were taken and there subsequently released by an officer, the other seven persons having been previously released on the road.  The character of the crime, complex by the number of the aggressors and of the persons injured, is not affected by the fact that its commission was continued in a different district.  This is  an offense which requires a successive and  continued execution duping a more or less lengthy period of time.  As the information  charges  that the persons guilty of  the offense in question were not  officers, the burden was upon the defendants to  prove that  they  were invested with authority to arrest the complainants.</p>
<p> In view of sections 5, 6, and 10 of General Orders, No. 58, dated April  23, 1900,  and for the reasons stated, we  are of  the  opinion that the judgment appealed  should  be affirmed, with the costs in  equal parts against each  of the surviving defendants.  So ordered.</p>
<p> <em>Arellano, C. J., Cooper, Willard, Mapa,</em> and <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
