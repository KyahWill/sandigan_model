				<H3>JOSE A. PATERNO, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. THE CITY OF MANILA, DEFENDANT AND  APPELLANT.
<br>br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>TRENT, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The plaintiff, Jose A. Paterno, is the owner of a&nbsp; certain parcel of land, together with the improvements thereon, which appears&nbsp; in the tax book of&nbsp; the&nbsp; city assessor&nbsp; and collector's office as lot&nbsp; No. 2, block 71, district of Santa Cruz, Manila.&nbsp; This property was assessed&nbsp; for the years 1901-2&nbsp; at the sum of&nbsp; $16,752&nbsp; United&nbsp; States&nbsp; currency. According to the assessment revision of 1903, the valuation placed on said property was $10,587 United States currency. The&nbsp; tax paid upon the former assessment was&nbsp; $418.80 for both&nbsp; years.&nbsp;&nbsp; According&nbsp; to&nbsp; the revised&nbsp; assessment it should have been $264.67.&nbsp; The plaintiff claims that under the provisions of Act No. 975 of the Philippine&nbsp; Commission the difference, equivalent&nbsp; to $154.13 United&nbsp; States&nbsp; currency, or&nbsp; P308.26, should be refunded.&nbsp; Judgment for the said&nbsp; amount of P308.26 has been&nbsp; rendered&nbsp; by one of the Courts of First Instance of the city of Manila&nbsp; in favor of the plaintiff, and from this judgment the&nbsp; defendant has appealed.<br><br>Counsel&nbsp; for appellant&nbsp; in&nbsp; his printed brief makes no specific assignment of errors, but argues in&nbsp; a general&nbsp; way two questions.&nbsp; The appellee insists that this appeal should be dismissed and the judgment affirmed for the reason&nbsp; that the appellant has not complied&nbsp; with the&nbsp; rules of this court with reference to the specification of alleged&nbsp; errors.&nbsp; Rules 19 and 20 are as follows:<br><blockquote>"19. Prefixed&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; brief of&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellant, but stated separately, shall&nbsp; be an assignment of errors&nbsp; intended to be urged.&nbsp; Each&nbsp; specification of error shall&nbsp; be separately, distinctly, and concisely stated without repetition,&nbsp; and&nbsp; they shall be numbered consecutively.&nbsp; All briefs shall be printed and shall exhibit an abstract of the argument on the points of law or fact to be discussed, with reference to the pages of the record and&nbsp; the authorities&nbsp; relied upon in&nbsp; support of each point.&nbsp; The brief of the appellant shall&nbsp; also contain a concise&nbsp; statement of the facts in the&nbsp; case.<br><br>"20. No error not affecting&nbsp; the jurisdiction&nbsp; over&nbsp; the subject-matter will be considered unless stated in the assignment of errors and relied upon in the brief."</blockquote>The above rules were promulgated by this court by virtue of the power&nbsp; conferred upon it&nbsp; by section&nbsp; 6&nbsp; of the Code of Civil Procedure.&nbsp; This&nbsp; section provides as&nbsp; follows:<br><blockquote>"The judges of the&nbsp; Supreme Court shall&nbsp; prepare rules regulating the conduct of business in the Supreme&nbsp; Court and in the Courts of First Instance.&nbsp; The&nbsp; rules shall&nbsp; be uniform for all&nbsp; Courts of First&nbsp; Instance throughout the Islands.&nbsp; Such rules, when duly made and promulgated and not in&nbsp; conflict with&nbsp; the laws&nbsp; of&nbsp; the United States&nbsp; or&nbsp; of the Philippine Islands, shall be binding&nbsp; and must&nbsp; be observed, but no judgment shall be reversed by reason of a failure of the court to comply with such rules unless the substantial rights of a party have been impaired by such failure."</blockquote>In the case of La Capellania del Convento de Tambobong <i> vs</i>. Antonio (8&nbsp; Phil. Rep.,&nbsp; 683), judgment having&nbsp; been rendered&nbsp; against the&nbsp; petitioner as to a&nbsp; part of the land described in the&nbsp; petition,&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff appealed, and this court, speaking through Mr. Justice Willard, with reference to assignment of errors, said (p.&nbsp; 684):<br><blockquote>"But in this court he (the appellant)&nbsp; has neither assigned as error, nor argued in his brief, the rulings adverse to him made in the court below.&nbsp; His appeal must,&nbsp; therefore,&nbsp; be considered as abandoned."</blockquote>It was&nbsp; the duty of the appellant to prefix to its brief an assignment of&nbsp; errors.&nbsp; Each specification of error should have been distinctly and concisely stated.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rules&nbsp; of this court&nbsp; are few and simple.&nbsp; They&nbsp; are the laws&nbsp; of the court and&nbsp; must be obeyed until repealed, unless it can&nbsp; be shown that they are in conflict with the laws of the United States&nbsp; or&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Philippine Islands. Rules&nbsp; 19 and 20 are not repugnant to any law in force in this&nbsp; jurisdiction.<br><blockquote>"A rule of court can not operate so as to render&nbsp; valid anything which is void in law, nor can it supersede a statute. But where a court is authorized to establish&nbsp; its own&nbsp; rules, such rules, when&nbsp; not repugnant to or&nbsp; in&nbsp; conflict with the organic laws, have all the force of law, and&nbsp; likewise&nbsp; as&nbsp; to an inferior court whose rules are prescribed by an appellate court."&nbsp;&nbsp; (David <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Aetna Ins. Co., 9 Iowa, 45; Walker <i>vs.</i> Ducros, 18 La. Ann., 703; Pratt <i>vs.</i> Pratt, 157 Mass., 503; Wood <i>vs. </i>Wood, 1 Ohio Dec, 589; Rio Grande Irr.&nbsp; Co. <i>vs.</i> Gilder sleeve, 174&nbsp; U. S., 603.)</blockquote>The appellant has not complied with these plain provisions providing for a uniform practice in this court.&nbsp;&nbsp; These rules mean&nbsp; something,&nbsp; otherwise&nbsp; they would not have&nbsp; been promulgated.&nbsp; They have been&nbsp; promulgated&nbsp; for several years and every practicing attorney should be familiar with them.<br><br>For these&nbsp; reasons we are&nbsp; of the opinion, and so hold, that this&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; should be&nbsp; dismissed and&nbsp; the&nbsp; judgment affirmed, with costs against&nbsp; the appellant.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i> Arellano,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J.,&nbsp; Torres, Johnson, </i> and <i>Moreland,&nbsp; JJ.,</i> concur.<br></div>
