				<H3>IGNACIO ARROYO, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. ALFRED BERWIN, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The complaint filed in this action is as follows:
<blockquote>
<p>"1. That both the plaintiff and the defendant are residents of the 
municipality of Iloilo, Philippine Islands.</p>
<p>"2. That the defendant is a <em>procurador judicial</em> in the law office of 
the Attorney John Bordman, and is duly authorized by the court to practice in 
justice of the peace courts of the Province of Iloilo.</p>
<p>"3. That the defendant, as such <em>procurador judicial</em>, represented 
Marcela Juaneza in the justice of the peace court of Iloilo in proceeding for 
theft prosecuted by the plaintiff Igancio Arroyo; that said cause was decided by 
the said justice of the peace against the accused, and the latter appealed to 
the Court of First Instance of Iloilo.</p>
<p>"4. That on August 14, 1914, which was the day set for the hearing of the 
appeal of the said cause against Marcela Juaneza for theft, Case No. 3120, the 
defendant requested the plaintiff to agree to dismiss the said criminal 
proceeding, and, on August 17, 1914, stipulated with the plaintiff in the 
presence of Roque Samson, among other things, that his client Marcela Juaneza 
would recognize the plaintiff's ownership in the land situated on Calle San 
Juan, suburb of Molo, municipality of Iloilo, Province of Iloilo, where his said 
client ordered the cane cut, which land and which cut cane are referred to in 
the cause for theft above-mentioned; and the defendant furthermore agreed that 
the plaintiff should obtain a Torrens title to the said land during the next 
term of the court for the trial of cadastral cases, and that the defendant's 
client, Marcela Juaneza, would not oppose the application for registration to be 
filed by the said applicant; provided that the plaintiff would ask the 
prosecuting attorney to dismiss the said proceedings filed against Marcela 
Juaneza and Alejandro Castro for the crime of theft.</p>
<p>"5. That the plaintiff on his part complied with the agreement, and requested 
the prosecuting attorney to dismiss the above-mentioned criminal cause; that the 
latter petitioned the court and the court did dismiss the said cause; that in 
exchange the defendant does not wish to comply with the above-mentioned 
agreement; that the plaintiff delivered to the defendant for the signature of 
the said Marcela Juaneza a written agreement attesting that the defendant's said 
client recognized the plaintiff's ownership int he described land and that she 
would not oppose the plaintiff's application for registration; and that up to 
the present time, the defendant has not returned to the plaintiff the said 
written agreement, notwithstanding the plaintiff's many demands.</p>
<p>"Therefore, the plaintiff prays the court to render judgment ordering the 
defendant to comply with the agreement by causing the latter's said client 
Marcela Juaneza to sign the document in which she recognizes the plaintiff's 
ownership of the land on which she ordered the cane cut and states that she will 
not oppose the plaintiff's application for the registration of the said land; 
and, further, by awarding to the plaintiff the costs of the present suit, as 
well as any other relief that justice and equity require."</p></blockquote>
<p>The trial judge dismissed this complaint on the ground of the illegality of 
the consideration of the alleged contract, and without stopping to consider any 
other objection to the complaint than that indicated by the court below, we are 
of opinion that the order appealed from must be affirmed.</p>
<p>An agreement by the owner of stolen goods to stifle the prosecution of the 
person charged with the theft, for a pecuniary or other valuable consideration, 
is manifestly contrary to public policy and the due administration of justice. 
In the interest of the public it is of the utmost importance that criminals 
should be prosecuted, and that all criminal proceedings should be instituted and 
maintained in the form and manner prescribed by law; and to permit an offender 
to escape the penalties prescribed by law by the purchase of immunity from 
private individuals would result in a manifest perversion of justice.</p>
<p>Article 1255 of the Civil Code provides that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The contracting parties may make the agreement and establish the clauses and 
conditions which they may deem advisable, provided they are not in contravention 
of law, morals, or public order."</p></blockquote>
<p>Article 1275 provides that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Contracts without consideration or with an illict one have no effect 
whatsoever. A consideration is illicit when it is contrary to law and good 
moral."</p></blockquote>
<p>The order entered in the court below should, therefore, be affirmed, with the 
costs of this instance against the appellant. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Moreland, Trent</em>, and <em>Araullo, JJ.</em>, concur.
