				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The defendants, charged with the murder of Benito Perez, were 
convicted by the trial court of the offense of lesiones menos graves, 
and sentenced to six months of <em>arresto mayor</em> the payment of 100
 Mexican pesos as damages to the heirs of the deceased, and to the costs
 of the trial.
<p>From the evidence introduced at the trial it appears that late at 
night on February 4, 1903, the deceased, Benito Perez, Policarpo 
Guevara, and Felipe Bautista, were arrested in their respective houses 
by the defendants; that "Valentin Trono was a subinspector of the 
municipal police of the town of Hagonoy; that he was accompanied by two 
municipal policemen named Jose and Agustin; that the deceased and his 
companions were suspected of the theft of a revolver belonging to one 
Maximo Angeles; that when Benito Perez was arrested he was in good 
health, not suffering from any disease; that he and his companions, 
Guevara and Bautista, were taken by their captors to a place called 
Sapang-Angelo and there beaten and illtreated, and that while they were 
undergoing this ill treatment Benito was heard to beg Maximo to pardon 
him, uttering the following words: "Maximo, have pity on me or else kill
 me at once;" that the blows inflicted left Policarpo Guevara breathless
 for some time and caused Felipe Bautista to suffer pains in the region 
of the heart for about an hour; that Benito Perez was so severely ill 
treated that in order to reach the municipal building of the town, to 
which the prisoners were taken after the ill treatment was inflicted 
upon them, he was obliged to lean upon the policeman Jose for the whole 
distance; that he was unable to stand, and furthermore complained of 
sharp pains in the abdomen; that when the prisoners were brought before 
the municipal president the following day they were discharged by him, 
as nothing was brought out against them in the investigation made 
concerning the theft of Maximo Angeles's revolver, which had led to 
their detention. Further, that Benito Perez, on account of the condition
 in which he had been left, was unable to return to his house alone, and
 that therefore a brother of his, named Estanislao, was obliged to take 
him from the municipal building to his home in a boat; that upon arrival
 at his home the deceased was obliged to go to bed, and his mother, 
Candelaria de los Santos, found his condition to be so serious that she 
immediately reported the facts to the justice of the peace of the town, 
denouncing the persons who had ill treated Benito as guilty of the crime
 of attempted homicide; that during the short time that the deceased was
 in bed he was unable to eat, urinated with great difficulty, and 
expelled with his urine drops of blood; that he complained of intense 
pains in the stomach and told his family that the pains were the result 
of blows inflicted upon him with a gun and other ill treatment received 
by him, and that his injuries would be the death of him. The deceased 
died on the morning of the day following—that is, February 6, 1903. At 
the time that Benito Perez and his companions were arrested each of the 
defendants was armed with a revolver and that Policemen Jose and Agustin
 were armed with guns.</p>
<p>The defense admits the fact of the arrest of Benito Perez and of 
Felipe Bautista and Policarpo Guevara by the defendants, but denies that
 they illtreated the said Benito. Nevertheless the proof for the 
prosecution upon this point is conclusive.</p>
<p>Felipe Bautista and Policarpo Guevara, who were with Benito Perez at 
the time of his arrest, after testifying that Perez was separated from 
them by their captors a distance of from 8 to 10 brazas at a place 
called Sapang-Angelo, they proceeded to testify that they heard blows 
inflicted on Benito and his groans and his supplications to Maximo to 
pardon him; both of them believed—for they were unable to see owing to 
the darkness of the night—that the blows were inflicted with a gun, 
owing to the fact Maximo Angeles took the gun which was carried by the 
policeman Agustin, who was standing beside the witness when he commenced
 to illtreat Benito.</p>
<p>The testimony of these witnesses has been corroborated by that of 
Pedro Santos, who was sent, together with one Esperidion, by Benito's 
mother to follow the latter and observe what was being done to him. This
 witness says that while Benito and his captors were on the edge of the 
estero and he and his companion, Esperidion, on the opposite bank some 
10 brazas away from the place where the others were, he heard them 
beating Benito with the butt of a gun, and heard the latter's groans and
 his supplications to Maximo and Valentin for pardon. They testified 
that they heard him say that if they would not pardon him they had 
better put him out of his misery at once.</p>
<p>It was not necessary that the witnesses should see the actual blows 
struck. It was sufficient that they heard them in order to be able to 
testify as to the fact that the blows were struck, more especially when 
the sound of the blows was followed by groans, showing suffering of the 
victim. The fact that the blows were struck with a gun or some other 
instrument is a circumstance of so accidental a character that it can 
not affect the reality of the facts in the case. Even if the blows had 
been struck with a club the result would be the same upon proof of the 
fact that the blows were struck and of the consequences thereof.</p>
<p>Hut in the present case the witnesses had good reason for believing 
that the blows were struck with guns, for this was the weapon which 
Maximo used when striking and beating Benito. It is true that he might 
have struck him with the hand alone or with a revolver, which Maximo 
also carried on that occasion (it does not appear that he had any other 
weapon), but we believe that it can not be absolutely asserted that it 
is impossible to distinguish by the sense of hearing blows given with 
the hand or with a revolver from those caused by a gun, taking into 
consideration the larger dimension and weight of the latter weapon and 
consequently the greater force and increased sound which would be 
produced by the blows inflicted with such an implement.</p>
<p>In addition to what has been testified by the foregoing witnesses, 
there is material evidence of the battery of Benito Perex shown by the 
testimony of Felipe Bautista and Policarpo Guevara, who testified that, 
after hearing the blows given to the former, they saw him unable to 
stand and complaining of sharp pains in the abdomen and being compelled 
to walk leaning on the policeman Jose, in order to be able to reach the 
municipal building of the town.</p>
<p>Evidence is likewise found in the fact that different parts of his 
body, such as the neck, hands, ribs, arms, and abdomen were seen by the 
witnesses, Estanislao Perez, Raymundo Perez, Juliana de los Santos, and 
Candelaria de los Santos, to be bruised and swollen.</p>
<p>The municipal president of Hagonoy, Jose It. Lopez, a witness on 
behalf of the defense, likewise must have observed something abnormal 
about Benito Perez when brought before him on the following morning, 
because he inquired of him, as testified by said president, whether he 
was ill, to which Benito replied that he was. The president testified 
that what moved him to make such inquiry was the fact that he noticed 
that Benito's face was pale; but according to Policarpo Guevara this was
 due to the fact that Benito was unable to remain on his feet in the 
presence of the president, in spite of the orders of the accused, 
Valentin, who told him to stand up. We give credit to the statement of 
the witness Guevara because it is not natural that the mere pallor on 
the face of a person who appears before an official accused of a crime 
should attract the latter's attention to the point of moving him to 
inquire whether he was ill or not.</p>
<p>The partiality of President Lopez in favor of the accused, Valentin 
Trono, is explained at once if it be taken into account that on being 
questioned during the trial what relationship he had with Valentin he 
replied that he refused to testify as to family secrets.</p>
<p>The very doctor, Andre's Icasiano, who examined Benito Perez, 
notwithstanding his manifest, clear, and evident tendency to favor the 
accused, was forced to certify that there appeared on the upper part of 
the left iliac region near the edge of the innominate bone two bruises 
caused by an instrument causing a contusion, one of the size of a half 
dollar and the other the size of a 20-cent piece.</p>
<p>The foregoing details show likewise the seriousness of the wounds of 
Benito Perez. They broke him down to such an extent that he was unable 
to again stand up from the moment he received the blows until the moment
 of his death. He was unable to reach the municipal building without the
 support of the policeman Jose", neither was he able to walk to his 
home, but was conveyed in a banca.</p>
<p>His condition was so serious when he arrived at the latter place that
 his mother, Candelaria de los Santos, justly alarmed, went without loss
 of time to file an information before the justice of the peace against 
the authors of the crime for attempted homicide. Tile physician, 
Icasiano, who examined Benito by order of the justice, called upon him 
twice on the same night with an interval of two hours only, which shows 
that he had fully realized the serious condition of his patient. The 
latter in the meantime was unable to take any food. He could only 
urinate a few drops of blood and felt continuous and sharp pains in the 
abdomen, which he attributed to the blows and ill treatment to which he 
had been subjected. He felt that he was dying; he so advised his family,
 and a few hours later the crisis came and he passed away. All this is 
proven by the combined testimony of the witnesses already mentioned, 
Candelaria and Juliana de los Santos, Estanislao and Raymunda Perez and 
Policarpo Guevara, and Felipe Bautista.</p>
<p>The defense contends that the death of Benito Perez was not due to 
the wounds inflicted, which were not serious, but to hepatic colic 
brought on by hypertrophic cirrhosis, from which the deceased had been 
suffering for a long time, basing such allegation on the certificate and
 testimony of the physician, Don Andres Icasiano, wherein such a 
statement is made.</p>
<p>We can not give any credit to the testimony of this physician because
 the facts which would serve as a foundation to his conclusion are 
manifestly inexact.</p>
<p>In the first place, in his certificate on folio 18 it is stated that 
the body of the deceased only showed two small bruises on the superior 
part of the left iliac region. The witness Esteban Perez testified that 
the deceased had bruises and swellings on the superior part of the left 
hand, on the neck, on the ribs, and on the abdomen; Raymunda Perez 
affirms having seen bruises on the abdomen on both sides, on the left 
arm, and on the left side of the neck; and Candelaria de los Santos 
likewise saw them on the upper part of the left hand and on the left 
side of the neck and on the ribs. In the second place, the physician 
affirms that the deceased devoted himself on the night of the occurrence
 to his customary libations. Nothing is shown in the case to corroborate
 this alleged habit, and especially nobody testified to having seen the 
deceased drunk on the night of the occurrence.</p>
<p>In the third place it is stated in said certificate of the physician 
that the deceased, after the bloios the effects whereof are being 
inquired into went on foot to the town from a distant barrio, and vice 
versa. This is manifestly untrue, because the proof in this case shows 
that from the place where the deceased was illtreated he was compelled 
to walk, being supported by a policeman until he reached the town, and 
in order to take him from the town to his home it was necessary to use a
 boat.</p>
<p>These last statements are so unjustified that the physician, 
Icasiano, when testifying, withdrew them during the trial. Why, then, 
did he set them forth in the certificate which appears on folio 18?</p>
<p>There is nothing in the case to show that the deceased had ever 
suffered from hypertrophic cirrhosis. The ailment which the deceased had
 at the time referred to by the physician, Icasiano, was cholera, 
according to the mother-of the deceased, Candelaria de los Santos, who 
testified, besides, referring to the time to which this case refers, 
that her son was of a robust constitution and suffered no ailments 
whatever.</p>
<p>There-are, besides, the following facts to be taken into 
consideration: After the physician, Icasiano, had examined the deceased,
 and while the latter was still alive, he told Raymunda Perez that the 
deceased was suffering from blows with a rifle.</p>
<p>When the death had taken place, the family of the deceased repeatedly
 requested the physician, Icasiano, to examine the body, which the 
latter flatly refused to do, and warned them, on the other hand, to bury
 him quickly, under the pretext that he had died of cholera. It likewise
 appears from the testimony of Raymunda Perez that said physician is an 
intimate friend of the accused, Maximo Angeles.</p>
<p>Expert testimony no doubt constitutes evidence worthy of meriting 
consideration, although not exclusive, on questions of a professional 
character. The courts of justice, however, are not bound to submit their
 findings necessarily to such testimony; they are free to weigh them, 
and they can give or refuse to give them any value as proof, or they can
 even counterbalance such evidence with the other elements of conviction
 which may have been adduced during the trial. In the present case there
 are to be found sufficient data which show in a conclusive manner the 
seriousness of the wounds inflicted upon the deceased, which from the 
very first moment prevented him from keeping on his feet, and caused him
 continuous and sharp pains in the abdomen and retention of the 
urine—symptoms which constantly showed themselves until death came—which
 in the absence of satisfactory proof to the contrary may be attributed 
to these causes, which undoubtedly were sufficient in themselves to 
bring about the death of the deceased.</p>
<p>The guilt of the accused is fully established in this case. They 
arrested the deceased and took him out of his house. They took him to a 
place called Sapang-Angelo, and they likewise committed the act of which
 they are charged.</p>
<p>Nevertheless their participation in the execution thereof was not 
equal. Maximo Angeles and Valentin Trono's participation was evidently 
direct and immediate, because they ill treated and assaulted the 
deceased, as appears from the testimony of Policarpo Guevara and Pedro 
Santos, as stated by the deceased himself to his mother (Candelaria de 
los Santos) and Juliana de los Santos.</p>
<p>With regard to Maximo Angeles, there likewise exists the testimony of
 Felipe Bautista, who says that this defendant illtreated and struck the
 deceased. Angeles and Trono are therefore to be considered as the 
authors by direct participation of the death of Benito Perez.</p>
<p>As to. the other defendant, Timoteo Natividad, his cooperation was in
 the nature of protection and aid, for even if it is true that he 
accompanied his codefendants and was likewise present with them in the 
place where the crime was committed, it does not appear, nevertheless, 
that he took any direct part in the ill treatment of the deceased; and 
for this reason he should be considered only as an accomplice of the two
 first named.</p>
<p>There is to be taken into account the aggravating circumstance of 
committing the deed at night and abuse of superiority, which should be 
compensated with the mitigating circumstance of the defendants not 
having the intention of causing an evil so great as that which was 
actually produced, for an examination of the record fully convinces us 
that when the former illtreated and struck Benito Perez they did not 
have in mind the deliberate intent of depriving him of his life, but 
only that of forcing him by such means to return the revolver which they
 claimed had been stolen.</p>
<p>We therefore reverse the judgment appealed from and sentence the 
defendants Maximo Angeles and Valentin Trono to the penalty of fourteen 
years eight months and one day of reclusion temporal, and Timoteo 
Natividad to the penalty of eight years and one day of prision mayor, 
and all three to the payment of an indemnity consisting of 500 pesos, 
Philippine currency, to the heirs of the deceased, and to the payment of
 the costs in this instance.</p>
