				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. HERMOGENES BESUÃ‘A, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The evidence of record sustains the findings of fact of the trial judge upon 
which he based his conclusion as to the guilt of the defendant and appellant in 
this case of the crime of assassination, and we find no error in the proceedings 
prejudicial to the rights of the accused.<br><p><br>It appears however from the 
findings of the trial judge, which are fully sustained by the evidence of 
record, that the commission of the offense was marked with the aggravating 
circumstances set forth in subsections 15 and 20 of article 10 of the Penal 
Code, the crime having been committed at night and in the house of the murdered 
man as charged in the information. Notwithstanding the existence of these 
aggravating circumstances, the trial judge imposed the prescribed penalty in its 
minimum degree, though manifestly, unless the accused be given the benefit of 
the provisions of article 11 of the Code as amended by Act No. 2142 of the 
Philippine Legislature, the penalty should have been imposed in its maximum 
degree and the convict sentenced to death.</p>
<p>Upon a review of the whole record we are of opinion that, giving the convict 
the benefit of the doubt with respect to the application of article 11, as 
amended, the prescribed penalty should have been imposed in its medium degree, 
setting off against the aggravating circumstances as disclosed by the evidence 
and the findings of the trial judge the extenuating circumstance set forth in 
the above mentioned article 11 of the Penal Code as amended by Act No. 2142.</p>
<p>We conclude therefore that the sentence imposed by the trial court should be 
modified by substituting for that portion thereof which imposes twenty years' 
imprisonment the penalty of life imprisonment, together with the accessory 
penalties prescribed by law, and thus modified the judgment of the court below 
convicting and sentencing the defendant should be and is hereby affirmed, with 
the costs of this instance against the appellant.</p>
