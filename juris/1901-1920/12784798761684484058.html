converted to his own use the sum of P110 belonging to Leoncio Mordice. The only 
questions at issue have to do with the credibility of the various witnesses 
called at the trial.
<p>The evidence for the prosecution is substantially as follows. Leoncio Mordice 
returned home one night in an intoxicated condition and became angry with his 
wife when he discovered that the evening meal was not ready. Terrified, she left 
the house and did not return for fifteen days. She went to the home of the 
lieutenant of the barrio, who took her to the home of the defendant, the latter 
being a councilman of the municipality. Nuevacobeta told her she should file a 
complaint against her husband for maltreatment, and on her refusal, he 
threatened to put her in jail unless she did so. The defendant talked to the 
justice of the peace about filing- a complaint against Mordice on five different 
occasions, once in the private residence of the Justice of the peace and twice 
at his office, unaccompanied by the woman, and twice accompanied by her. On his 
first visit in company with the woman, the Justice of the peace directed her to 
call her witnesses. On her second visit in company with the defendant she 
brought some witnesses with her and on this occasion, after examining into the 
facts, the justice refused to issue a warrant on the ground that no offense had 
been committed. The defendant, however, told Gabina Pajarito, an old woman who 
lived with Mordice and who went to see the defendant on behalf of the husband, 
that Mordice would be imprisoned for one year and seven months and have to pay a 
fine of P100, and costs, unless he could find P50 to be delivered to the 
:justice of the peace for dismissing the complaint. The old woman promised to 
try to secure the money. A few days later the defendant came to Mordice's house 
and there repeated what he had said to the old woman, whereupon Mordice agreed 
to sell his carabao in order to raise the money. The defendant took the 
registration certificate of the carabao away with him, saying that he himself 
would endeavor to find a purchaser for the carabao. On the evening of the next 
day the carabao was brought to the municipal building and sold to Daniel Murillo 
for P125. Murillo paid that amount, less P15, to the defendant on the upper 
floor of the municipal building in the presence of Mordice. The difference of 
P15 represented a loan or advance to the defendant made by the purchaser that 
morning. Murillo told the defendant to look after the balance himself. The 
defendant thereupon told Mordice that he should come down to his (the 
defendant's) house where they would settle the matter. When Mordice arrived at 
the defendant's house, the latter paid him P15 which Mordice accepted under 
protest, claiming that he should be given the balance, less P50, which he 
understood was to be paid to the Justice of the peace for dismissing the 
complaint against him. About a week later, accompanied by Gregorio Era, Mordice 
came to the defendant's house and again asked him for the balance due, but on 
that occasion the defendant told him he would have to wait a while as he had 
already spent the money. Mordice replied that he would not leave until he had 
received it, and the defendant immediately left. Mordice and Era waited for him 
to come back until 4 o'clock in the afternoon, but as he did not return they 
then left.</p>
<p>As to the trouble between Mordice and his wife, the intervention of the 
defendant and his accompanying her to the justice of the peace to file a 
complaint against her husband; as to the sale of the carabao to Murillo for the 
sum of P125 and the advance made earlier in the day by Murillo to the defendant, 
and the fact that Murillo only paid P110 at the time the sale was completed in 
the municipal building; and as to the payment of P15 by the defendant to Mordice 
in the former's house a few hours later, the theory of the defense agrees with 
that of the prosecution. But the defendant denied that he had threatened the 
woman in order to make her file a complaint against her husband; or that he had 
threatened Mordice in order to secure from him P50 to have the alleged 
prosecution against him dismissed, He swore that he paid over to Mordice the sum 
of P110 in the municipal building immediately after it had been handed him by 
Murillo, although the latter was not present at that time. He also denied that 
Mordice protested a few hours later when he received the balance of paid at the 
defendant's house. And he asserted that the present case is the indirect outcome 
of a political quarrel between himself and one Clasico Tanjanlangit.</p>
<p>As to the evidence of the prosecution that the defendant appeared at 
Mordice's house and informed him that he would he punished with imprisonment and 
a fine unless he secured P50 to be paid the justice of the peace, we have the 
testimony of Mordice, the old woman, Gabina Pajarito, and Gregorio Era. Mordice 
gathered tuba for Era and the latter was at Mordice's house at that time on 
business. There were no witnesses to the alleged transfer in the municipal 
building of the P110 by the defendant to Mordice immediately after Murillo left 
them, so that we have only the conflicting testimony of the defendant and 
Mordice on this point. Teodoro Naragdad, conceded by both sides to have 
witnessed the delivery of the P15 to Mordice at the defendant's house, testified 
that Mordice did protest that there was more due him. This directly contradicts 
the defendant on this point. It is to be noted also that Naragdad was called as 
a witness by the defense. The old woman Gabina Pajarito testified that Mordice 
returned home that evening with only P15. The evidence of these two witnesses 
tends at least to show that the defendant did not turn over the P110 to Mordice 
in the municipal building.</p>
<p>The purchaser of the carabao, Daniel Murillo, testified that he left Mordice 
and the defendant in the municipal building, and went down-stairs to the 
municipal stables to get the carabao where he met Gregorio Era, whom he told to 
take the carabao to the home of his new owner. As he returned from the stables 
he met Mordice with the P110 in his hands and Mordice asked for the remaining 
P15, which Murillo refused to give him. Gregorio favorito also testified that he 
witnessed the conversation between Mordice and Murillo and saw a roll of paper 
money in Mordice's hand, which the latter said amounted to P110. It is clear 
that if this testimony be true, the defendant should be acquitted. But we are of 
opinion that the lower court was justified in refusing to believe either of 
these witnesses. As to Murillo, an affidavit signed by him was introduced in 
evidence in which he details the facts related above as to the purchase of the 
carabao through the intervention of the defendant and his advance to the latter 
on the morning of the sale of P15, and his delivery of the remaining P110 to the 
defendant in the municipal building that afternoon, but no mention is made in 
this affidavit of the conversation had between him and Mordice a few minutes 
later, during which Murillo claims to have seen the P110 in Mordice's hands. 
This affidavit was prepared after Mordice had complained to the authorities 
regarding the withholding by the defendant of the sum claimed to be still due 
him from the sale of the carabao. Clasico Tanjanlangit testified that Mordice 
complained to him against the defendant and that he thereupon called Murillo to 
his house and, after questioning him, the two went to the justice of the peace 
where Murillo made the affidavit in question. Murillo testified that 
Tanjanlangit called him to his house by means of a note which read, "Dear Ani: I 
will be glad if you can come around to my house any time today because we have 
to talk about one good thing." Upon coming to Tanjanlangit's house the latter 
told Him he would have to testify for Mordice or he would be complained against. 
He first said that Tanjanlangit merely told him to tell the truth, but later 
said that Tanjanlangit told him to testify in favor of Mordice. If this were 
true it would explain how the fact of the conversation outside the municipal 
building between him and Mordice, during which he saw P110 in the latter's hands 
came to be omitted from the affidavit. But upon being questioned at the trial as 
to why this was left out of the affidavit, his only reply was that it was 
because the justice of the peace had not asked him what occurred outside the 
municipal building. If the affidavit spoke the truth, it is certain that no such 
conversation occurred, for the reason that at the time of its making the affiant 
was fully informed of the fact that Mordice was complaining because the money 
had not been turned over to him. If it did not speak the truth and the alleged 
conversation outside the municipal building did take place, there was no reason 
for the affiant saying at the trial, that the reason it was omitted from the 
affidavit was because the Justice of the peace had not asked him about it, when 
the real reason was that it had been suppressed through the influence of 
Tanjanlangit. As to the testimony of Gregorio Favorito regarding this alleged 
conversation, it is worthy of note that Murillo, who was called first, made no 
mention of his being present when it occurred. Furthermore the two disagreed as 
to the substance of what was said during this alleged meeting, and from a more 
general view of the whole matter it seems improbable, at least, that immediately 
after consenting to go to the defendant's house to get the remaining P15, as 
testified by the defendant, Mordice should rush out of the municipal building 
and demand that amount of Murillo.</p>
<p>As to the political animosity between Tanjanlangit and this defendant, the 
latter testified that it arose from the fact that he had objected to 
Tanjanlangit's using the municipal typewriter for private purposes without 
paying the rate of 10 centavos per hundred words which was established by a town 
ordinance. It may be true that this matter rankled in Tanjanlangit's breast and 
that when Mordice came to him and exposed the defendant's duplicity, he was glad 
to assist in pressing the prosecution against him. But the facts against the 
accused are marshalled in too orderly and convincing a manner and come from too 
many independent witnesses, and his defense is too self-contradictory and 
improbable for us to believe that the charge against him has no foundation in 
fact, and was concocted out of the whole cloth by a political adversary.</p>
<p>After a careful review of the entire record, we have no hesitancy in arriving 
at the conclusion that the findings of fact by the lower court should not be 
disturbed. We find no error in the proceedings prejudicial to the rights of the 
accused. The Judgment entered in the lower court convicting and sentencing him 
should, therefore, be affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the 
appellant.</p>
<p>It is so ordered.<br></p></div>
