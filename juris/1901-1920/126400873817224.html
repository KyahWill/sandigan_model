				<BR><STRONG>MAPA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The defendant appeals from a judgment convicting him of a violation of Act No. 1761, wherein he was  sentenced to six months' imprisonment, a fine of P300, and, in default of such payment, to the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment at the rate of one day for each 12 pesetas and a half he fails to pay, not to exceed one-third of the time of the principal penalty, and to payment of the costs.</p>
<p>It is a fact which we find to be  sufficiently proven  that on the date mentioned in the complaint, an internal-revenue agent went  to the defendant's  house and found in  various places therein  two little cans and a  small horn  jar, all containing opium; another small tin with  about 50 grams of opium ashes; scales for weighing opium; a pan for cooking the said drug, and two small lamps such as are  used in smoking opium.  This fact effectively  sustains the finding in the judgment appealed from as to the defendant's guilt.</p>
<p>Counsel  for the defense  alleges that  the trial  court obliged the defendant to stand trial without the assistance of an attorney,  and refused to allow his request for time to procure such counsel for his defense; this,  he  alleges, is an error  that affects the  essential rights of  the defendant.</p>
<p>The facts  in no manner support this allegation.  Nowhere in the record does it  appear  that any  postponement was requested by  the defendant for securing counsel. That part of the  record in  which reference  is made to this  point reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The  above-mentioned  case  was called  for hearing on this  date,  September 29,  1910, there being present the defendant, not represented by counsel, and the "fiscal  representing the United  States.  On the defendant's being asked whether  he could afford to  employ a lawyer, he replied in the affirmative, but said that he had been unable  to come to an agreement with one as to the  amount he should pay  him for  his services.   This  court being of the opinion that the defendant is not entitled to the appointment of  counsel <i>de oficio</i>, and, declining to recognize the fact  of his not having reached an agreement  with his attorney in the matter of his fees  as a proper excuse for postponing the hearing  of this case, orders the  reading of the complaint."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason of the court for not postponing the hearing is set forth  in  another part of the  record  and is as  follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The bond given by the defendant in this case was first forfeited; later, the forfeiture was canceled.   Another date was set for the hearing, at least two days in advance. The court sees no  reason whatever for  postponing this case, and still less  for  showing any consideration to  the defendant because he is not represented by counsel, since he does not belong to  the class of  poor  people who  are entitled to the appointment of counsel <i>de oficio</i>.  If he  can not come to an agreement with Mr. Sotto as to the amount of the  latter's fees for defending him, the court is  not called upon  to  take the matter into consideration as a ground for postponement and other similar delays."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By order of the court the complaint was duly read to the defendant: the latter acknowledged notification thereof and  replied by pleading not  guilty.   Neither on  that occasion, nor before, nor afterwards, nor, in short, at any time during the progress of  the trial, did the defendant request the postponement or suspension of the same or raise any objection or protest  of any sort against the continuance of the trial.  Far from so  doing, the record shows that during the presentation of the evidence he cross-examined the witnesses for the prosecution and afterwards  testified himself as a witness, notwithstanding that he was advised by  the court of his right not to testify unless he  desired to do so of his own free will and consent.</p>
<p>These being the facts, the  assignment of error contained in the brief filed by defendant's counsel is absolutely devoid of foundation.   Accused persons are  undoubtedly entitled to appoint an attorney to defend them at trial, or to have one  appointed <i>de oficio</i>, should they  ask  for one and not possess the necessary means to employ an attorney of their own.  But it devolves exclusively upon them to avail themselves of this right.  It is one which they are perfectly entitled to waive and they may defend themselves in person.   The law expressly authorizes them,  as it  could not but do, to defend themselves in person, without the assistance of counsel.  (Sec. 15, General Orders, No. 58.)   It is understood, of course, that they  waive their right to  be assisted by counsel when they not  only  do not  appoint  or request one, but voluntarily submit to trial, and especially when they  actually exercise therein the right  of  defense by cross-examining the witnesses for  the prosecution and by introducing evidence in their own  behalf,  as was done in the present case.  It is evident that the defendant herein preferred to defend himself personally in the Court of First Instance and, therefore, he can not be heard to complain that he was not  assisted by any attorney in the proceedings there had.  When  an  accused  person in a criminal  case chooses to defend himself in person, none of his rights are infringed by the fact that the  action was prosecuted without the intervention of an attorney  in  his behalf.   In such a case the attendance  of the latter is in no wise necessary for the  legality and perfect propriety of the proceedings.</p>
<p>In consideration of the circumstances of the case, we are of the opinion that a fine  of  P300 is a sufficient  penalty for the crime committed by the accused.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed  from is  therefore modified  in the sense that the  defendant is sentenced only  to pay the fine of P300, or, in case of insolvency, to suffer the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment  at  the rate of one day for each P2.50 which  he may  fail to pay, and the costs  in this instance.</p>
