				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">From the record the following facts appear:<br><blockquote>(1) That on the 28th day of January, 1905, the acting provincial treasurer of the Province of Pampanga issued to one S. S. McVey, a certificate of tax sale for certain land sold at a tax sale in said Province of Pampanga.<br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;(2) On the 10th day of August,&nbsp; 1906, the said S. S. McVey,&nbsp; assigned the&nbsp; said certificate of tax sale&nbsp; to the plaintiff herein.<br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;(3) On the&nbsp; 13th day of September,&nbsp; 1906, the plaintiff herein filed a petition in this&nbsp; court, praying that&nbsp; a writ of mandamus be&nbsp; issued against the&nbsp; defendant herein, as treasurer of said Province of Pampanga, to compel&nbsp; him to issue to the plaintiff a tax deed to the lands described in said certificate of tax sale.<br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;(4) On the&nbsp; 30th&nbsp; day of October, 1906, the Attorney-General of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippine Islands, representing the said treasurer, filed a demurrer to said petition for mandamus, upon the ground that the complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, specifically stating the reasons therefor. Said demurrer was heard by this court on the 12th day of November, 1906.</blockquote>The question presented is whether or not the plaintiff is entitled to a writ of mandamus under the provisions of law in force in the Philippine&nbsp; Islands.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the general rule that a&nbsp; writ of mandamus will not lie against a corporation,&nbsp; board, or officer&nbsp; to compel&nbsp; him or them to perform any specific duty unless, such duty is clearly defined by the law or by virtue of an official duty or relation.<br>&nbsp;<br>Section 80 of the Municipal Code (Act No. 82) provides: "In case the taxpayer shall not redeem the land sold as above provided within&nbsp; one year from the date of sale, the provincial treasurer, or his deputy,&nbsp; in&nbsp; the name of such treasurer, shall, as grantor,&nbsp; execute&nbsp; a deed in&nbsp; form and effect sufficient under the laws of the Islands to convey to the <i>purchaser </i>so much&nbsp; of the land against which the taxes have been assessed as has been&nbsp; sold, free from alliens of any kind whatsoever, and the deeds shall succinctly recite all the proceedings upon which the validity&nbsp; of the&nbsp; sale depends."<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>It will be noted from the above provision&nbsp; of the said Municipal Code, that the treasurer or his deputy shall execute the deed, under the provisions of said Municipal Code,&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; <i>purchaser.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; The plaintiff herein is the assignee of the purchaser.&nbsp;&nbsp; The law gave&nbsp; to the purchaser at the tax sale alone,&nbsp; the right to have the deed executed to him.&nbsp;&nbsp; The law made no provision to have the said tax deed issued to the assignee of the purchaser.&nbsp; This provision of the said Municipal Code seems to have been taken from section 489 of the Statutes of the&nbsp; State of Vermont,&nbsp; and the courts of that&nbsp; State have held, together with nearly all the States of the Union,&nbsp; that every&nbsp; statute which provides a method by which a person&nbsp; may be divested of his property&nbsp; under a&nbsp; special authority, must&nbsp; be construed strictly.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;In the case of Thatcher vs. Powell (6 Wheaton, 119,123) the Supreme Court of the United States said:<br><blockquote> "That no individual or public officer can sell and convey a good title to&nbsp; the land of another, unless authorized so to do by express law, is one of those self-evident propositions to which the&nbsp; mind assents without hesitation; and that the person invested with such a power must pursue with precision the course prescribed by law, or 7m act is invalid is a principal which has&nbsp; been repeatedly recognized in this court."</blockquote>And again in&nbsp; the case&nbsp; of Alexander vs. Savage (90 Ala.,383) the Supreme Court of&nbsp; Alabama held:<br><blockquote>"A tax deed made to one <i>substituted&nbsp; for the purchaser</i>, or to any grantee other than the&nbsp; one&nbsp; <i>sanctioned by&nbsp; the statute</i>, is void.&nbsp; The, statutory authority to convey must be strictly pursued and&nbsp; the deed made only to those to whom&nbsp; he&nbsp; is authorized&nbsp; by law to execute it;&nbsp; (Keen&nbsp; vs. Houghton, 19&nbsp; Maine, 368.)"</blockquote>The&nbsp; law in&nbsp; the present case required the&nbsp; defendant to execute the deed to the purchaser under&nbsp; the tax sale.&nbsp; The demurrer&nbsp; is therefore hereby sustained and the plaintiff&nbsp; is hereby given ten days from the notice of this decision within which&nbsp; to&nbsp; amend&nbsp; his complaint, or otherwise the case&nbsp; will be dismissed with costs to&nbsp; the plaintiff.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Willard</i>, and <i>Tracey, JJ</i>., concur.<br></div>
