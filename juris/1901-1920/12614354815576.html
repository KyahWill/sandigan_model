				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is a motion  to dismiss a bill of exceptions.  The judgment was rendered  on the 29th day of June, 1905. It does not appear  from the bill of exceptions when the defendant, the  defeated  party, was notified of the judgment.  He claims that he was  not notified  until  the  3d of July.   The appellee claims that he  was notified on the 1st of July.  On the 7th day of July the defendant made a motion for a  new trial on the ground that the decision was not justified by  the evidence. This motion was denied on the 29th day of July.   On  the same day the appellant excepted to the  order denying  the motion, and gave notice of his intention to present  a bill of exceptions, which bill of exceptions he presented on  August 4.</p>
<p>All of the questions except  one  argued by the appellee in his motion to dismiss  have  been discussed and decided against him in the case of Antonia de la Cruz <em>vs</em>. Santiago Garcia,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> No. 2485, August 17, 1905.  The point  that  the motion for  a new trial was not made  or decided  at  the same term at which  the case was tried  was not discussed in the case cited.  In the present case, which  comes from the city of Manila, a term of the court commenced  on  the 3d  day of July,  1905, and it must be  assumed  that  the prior term at which the case was tried ended on the 2d day of July, and it is claimed by the appellee that the motion for a new trial not having been made at the term at which the case was tried, it produced no effect.  The only provision of the  law relating to the matter is section 145 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which says that at any time during .the term  at  which the action has been tried  the judge may set aside  the judgment and grant a new trial. It will be noticed that  this  section  says nothing about the presentation  of  a  motion for  a new trial.  If it  requires a motion  for a new trial to be presented within the same term at which the case was tried, it also requires it to be decided within that term.   It will be noticed also that section 497, paragraph 3, in speaking of the motion for a new trial, which is made for the purpose of enabling the defeated party to secure a review of the  evidence in this court, says  nothing  about  the necessity of making that motion or of having it decided at the term at which the case was tried.</p>
<p>While the point has  never been discussed in any  of  the decisions of this court, yet it has  always been assumed that the fact that the motion for a  new trial was decided by the judge after the term at which the case was tried had ended, did not deprive the defeated  party of his right to secure a  review of the evidence  in this court.   In  the case above cited,  which came from the Province of  Rizal, the judgment was entered on the 21st of July, 1903.  The motion  for a new trial was not  decided until the 26th of October, 1903.   In objecting to  the allowance of the bill of exceptions in that  case the appellee made the point that the motion for a new trial was  not made at the  term at which  the case was  tried.   Nothing was  said about this objection in the decision, and it does not appear from the case whether as a matter of fact the term of the court at Pasig continued from the  21st of  July,  1903,  until the 26th  of  October 1903.   However, in the case of Vicente Gomez <em>vs</em>. Jacinta Hipolito<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> (3 Off. Gaz., 33) judgment was entered on the 1st of May, 1903.  The defeated party was notified  thereof on  the 21st of May.  On the 23d of May he moved for a new trial, which was not decided until the 23d of July.  That case came from the city of 'Manila, and it thus appears that the motion for a new  trial  was not decided at the term at which the case was tried.  We, however, refused to dismiss the bill of exceptions.</p>
<p>We follow the decision in that case, with the suggestion that if the motion  must be decided at the term  at  which the case was tried, "the  right of the defeated party to  a review of the evidence in this court, a right secured to him by said section 497, paragraph 3, might be taken from him by a mere delay on the part of the judge in deciding the motion, a delay  for which the defeated party would in no way be responsible.</p>

<em>DISSENTING</em></div>
<p><strong>TORRES, J.: </strong></p>
<p>The undersigned, notwithstanding his respect for  the majority decision, is nevertheless of the opinion that  under section 143 of the Code  of Civil Procedure the appellee's motion in this case should be granted, and appellant's  bill of exceptions dismissed.</p>
<p>In view of the fact that the majority opinion follows the decision  in the case of Antonia de la Cruz <em>vs</em>.  Santiago Garcia, No. 2485, the undersigned, in order to avoid repetitions, refers to his dissenting opinion in that case  as a part of this opinion.   Otherwise I agree  that the court's delay in deciding the motion  for a new  trial could not have worked against the moving party, who presented his motion in due time, so as to deprive him of his  right to secure  a review of the evidence in this court nor prevent the defeated party from prosecuting, his remedy under sections 143 and 145 of the Code, when judgment is rendered on the last day of the term in the absence of such party or his attorney and it appears that they received no notice of its rendition until  after the commencement of the following term.</p>
<p>For the reasons given in my  dissenting  opinion  in the case cited and in view of the fact that the exception to the judgment and the notice of appellant's intention to present a bill of exceptions were not made forthwith or as soon as practicable as required  by the provisions  of section  143 of the Code of  Civil Procedure and without reference  to the motion  for a new trial, I am of  opinion that  the bill of exceptions should be dismissed.</p>
<em>Johnson, J.,</em> reserves  his opinion.<br>
