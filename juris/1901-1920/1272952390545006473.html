				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND  APPELLEE, VS. GABINA DE LA CRUZ, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This cause was initiated by a complaint of the following tenor;<br><blockquote>"The undersigned, the provincial fiscal of the Province of La Laguna, charges Gabina de la Cruz, the accused above-mentioned, with&nbsp; the crime of <i>injurias&nbsp; graves,</i>&nbsp; committed as follows:<br><br>"The said&nbsp; accused, on the&nbsp; 10th&nbsp; day of March, 1909, in the municipality of Calamba, of the Province of&nbsp; La Laguna, P. L, did, with violation of the Jaw, voluntarily,&nbsp; unlawfully and criminally, in a public place and in the presence of several persons, and with the intent to discredit, dishonor and expose to contempt Ramon Santos, the municipal president of the said&nbsp; municipality, utter the following words: <i>'Rayo de presidente, que quieres&nbsp; ser presidente para apoderarte de la propiedad de otros,'</i>&nbsp; (You are a queer sort of president, for&nbsp; you wish to be president in order to grab other people's&nbsp; property), which words are notoriously&nbsp; injurious, considering the position, dignity and circumstances of the person aggrieved."</blockquote>Other than this complaint,&nbsp; the record of the proceedings shows none to have been made by the alleged offended party.<br><br>The facts connected with&nbsp; the&nbsp; crime under prosecution are&nbsp; as follows: While Juan&nbsp; Flores was building a fence around the lot of Ramon Santos,&nbsp; the accused, who owned land adjoining the said lot, and a&nbsp; niece of hers, obstinately prevented him from&nbsp; continuing&nbsp; the work,&nbsp; and he then notified&nbsp; Ramon Santos of the trouble.&nbsp;&nbsp; The latter then went to&nbsp; the place, and as Gabina de la Cruz, instead of acquiescing&nbsp; in his plea that they should&nbsp; not molest&nbsp; his workman and&nbsp; the suggestion that,&nbsp; if they felt that they were aggrieved, they&nbsp; should&nbsp; apply&nbsp; to&nbsp; the courts, created a&nbsp; disturbance&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; street,&nbsp; whereupon&nbsp; some policemen endeavored to take her to the <i>presidencia</i>, and it was then that Gabina de la&nbsp; Cruz uttered the alleged offensive words set forth in the complaint.<br><br>According to the principles underlying&nbsp; the&nbsp; Penal Code, there are two&nbsp; classes&nbsp; of insults: Those directed against private&nbsp; parties, which&nbsp; are purely private crimes and can not be prosecuted&nbsp; <i>de oficio</i> or&nbsp; on the initiative and through the&nbsp; public prosecutor,&nbsp; and those&nbsp; against the authorities, public officials or agents of the authorities, which are real public crimes that may be prosecuted&nbsp; <i>de oficio </i>and upon the initiative of the said public prosecutor.<br><br>This public crime of&nbsp; uttering insults against the authorities, public officials and agents of the authorities, in order to be such must have&nbsp; been committed while they were&nbsp; in the exercise of their functions or on the occasion thereof. (Arts.&nbsp; 256, 257,&nbsp; Penal Code.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Even&nbsp; though the&nbsp; insult was against the authorities, public&nbsp; official or agent of the authorities, if it was not&nbsp; committed while he was in the exercise or on the occasion of his official duties, it does not constitute a public crime.<br><br>The insult alleged in the complaint has nothing&nbsp; to&nbsp; do with the official duties of&nbsp; a municipal&nbsp; president.&nbsp;&nbsp; The offended&nbsp; party was not&nbsp; at&nbsp; the time&nbsp; in&nbsp; the exercise of his functions as municipal president, nor was it on the occasion thereof that the accused&nbsp; uttered against him&nbsp; the words quoted&nbsp; in the&nbsp; complaint.&nbsp; It was on&nbsp; the occasion&nbsp; of the exercise of&nbsp; his apparent right of ownership&nbsp; with respect to what he understood&nbsp; to&nbsp; be the boundary&nbsp; line between his lot and&nbsp; that of his neighbor, Gabina de la&nbsp; Cruz, that the latter, vexed because they were forcing her away from the place of the dispute, gave rein&nbsp; to&nbsp; her tongue in that manner by&nbsp; making allusions to&nbsp; the&nbsp; office then held by the neighbor with whom&nbsp; she was disputing.&nbsp; But to&nbsp; allude to an office is&nbsp; not tantamount&nbsp; to showing disrespect to him who holds it while he is in the exercise of the same or on the occasion of the performance of his functions.<br><br>The present cause, then,&nbsp; has to do with an insult against a private party, although the offense may be considered as aggravated by the position&nbsp; of the offended person.<br><br>Act No. 1773 of the Philippine Commission has caused, since October 11, 1907, all&nbsp; crimes of <i>injuria</i> to be deemed public crimes, to be prosecuted in the same manner as all other public crimes (sec. 1); but the act contains&nbsp; a special proviso&nbsp; "that no prosecution for the crimes of&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; or <i>injuria</i> committed against persons other than public officials or employees shall be&nbsp; instituted except upon the <i>complaint"</i> (or <i>denuncia,</i> as interpreted by a majority of this court) "of the aggrieved person."<br><br>This cause not having been instituted at the instance or upon the complaint of the aggrieved person, the prosecution is&nbsp; deemed to be entirely without foundation, and&nbsp; the&nbsp; proceedings had, contrary to the express prohibition of the law, are null and void.<br><br>This court&nbsp; can not&nbsp; consider&nbsp; the question&nbsp; whether the judgment appealed from is or is not just, when the&nbsp; entire process is radically null.<br><br>Therefore, we declare&nbsp; all the proceedings had to be null and void, and the complaint filed is dismissed.&nbsp;&nbsp; No special finding is made as to the costs.<br><br><i>Torres, Johnson, Moreland,</i> and <i>Trent, JJ.</i>, concur.<br></div>
