				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MORELAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of the city 
of Manila in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of P3,000, with interest thereon 
at the rate of 1 1/2 per cent per month from September 5, 1912, together with 
the costs.
<p>The action was brought by the plaintiff upon the contract of indorsement 
alleged to have been made in his favor by the defendant upon the following 
promissory note:</p>
<table align="center" border="0" width="90%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="53%">"P3,000.</td>
<td width="47%">Due 5th of September, 1912.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<blockquote>
<p>"We jointly and severally agree to pay to the order of Don Antonio G. Serrano 
on or before the 5th day of September, 1912, the sum of three thousand pesos 
(P3,000) for value received for commercial operations. Notice and protest 
renounced. If the sum herein mentioned is not completely paid on the 5th day of 
September, 1912, this instrument will draw interest at the rate of 1 1/2 per 
cent per month from the date when due until the date of its complete payment. 
The makers hereof agree to pay the additional sum of P500 as attorney's fees in 
case of failure to pay the note.</p>
<p>"Manila, June 5,1912.</p>
<p>(Sgd.) "For Padern, Moreno &amp; Co., by F. Moreno, member of the firm. For 
Jose" Padern, by F. Moreno. Angel Gimenez."</p></blockquote>
<p>The note was indorsed on the back as follows :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Pay to the order of Don Fernando Maulini, value received. Manila, June 5, 
1912. (Sgd.) A. G. Serrano."</p></blockquote>
<p>The first question for resolution on this appeal is whether or not, under the 
Negotiable Instruments Law, an indorser of a negotiable promissory note may, in 
an action brought by his indorsee, show, by parol evidence, that the indorsement 
was wholly without consideration and that, in making it, the indorser acted as 
agent for the indorsee, as a mere vehicle of transfer of the naked title from 
the maker to the indorsee, for which he received no consideration whatever.</p>
<p>The learned trial court, although it received parol evidence on the subject 
provisionally, held, on the final decision of the case, that such evidence was 
not admissible to alter, vary, modify or contradict the terms of the contract of 
indorsement, and, therefore, refused to consider the evidence thus provisionally 
received, which tended to show that, by verbal agreement between the indorser 
and the indorsee, the indorser, in making the indorsement, was acting as agent 
for the indorsee, as a mere vehicle for the transference of naked title, and 
that his indorsement was wholly without consideration. The court also held that 
it was immaterial whether there was a consideration for the transfer or not, as 
the indorser, under the evidence offered, was an accommodation indorser.</p>
<p>We are of the opinion that the trial court erred in both findings.</p>
<p>In the first place, the consideration of a negotiable promissory note, or of 
any of the contracts connected therewith, like that of any other written 
instrument, is, between the immediate parties to the contract, open to attack, 
under proper circumstances, for the purpose of showing an absolute lack or 
failure of consideration.</p>
<p>It seems, according to the parol evidence provisionally admitted on the 
trial, that the defendant was a broker doing business in the city of Manila and 
that part of his business consisted in looking up and ascertaining persons who 
had money to loan as well as those who desired to borrow money and, acting as a 
mediary, negotiate a loan between the two. He had done much business with the 
plaintiff and the borrower, as well as with many other people in the city of 
Manila, prior to the matter which is the basis of this action, and was well 
known to the parties interested. According to his custom in transactions of this 
kind, and the arrangement made in this particular case, the broker obtained 
compensation for his services of the borrower, the lender paying nothing1 
therefor. Sometimes this was a certain per cent of the sum loaned; at other 
times it was a part of the interest which the borrower was to pay, the latter 
paying 1 1/2 per cent per month for the use of the money, the lender taking 1 
per cent and the broker 1/2 per cent. According to the method usually followed 
in these transactions, and the procedure in this particular case, the broker 
delivered the money personally to the borrower, took the note in his own name 
and immediately transferred it by indorsement to the lender. In the case at bar 
this was done at the special request of the indorsee and simply as a favor to 
him, the latter stating to the broker that he did not wish his name to appear on 
the books of the borrowing company as a lender of money and that he desired that 
the broker take the note in his own name, immediately transferring to him title 
thereto by indorsement. This was done, the note being <em>at</em> <em>once</em> 
transferred to the lender.</p>
<p>According to the evidence referred to, there never was a moment when Serrano 
was the real owner of the note. It was always the note of the indorsee, Maulini, 
he having furnished the money which was the consideration for the note directly 
to the maker and being the only person who had the slightest interest therein, 
Serrano, the broker, acting solely as an agent, a vehicle by which the naked 
title to the note passed from the borrower to the lender. The only payment that 
the broker received was for his services <em>in negotiating the loan.</em> He 
was paid absolutely nothing for becoming responsible as an indorser on the 
paper, nor did the indorsee lose, pay or forego anything, or alter 
his<br>position thereby.</p>
<p>Nor was the defendant an accommodation indorser. The learned trial court 
quoted that provision of the Negotiable Instruments Law which defines an 
accommodation party as "one who has signed the intrument as maker, drawer, 
acceptor, or indorser, without receiving value therefor, and for the purpose of 
<em>lending his name to some other person.</em>Such a person is liable on the 
instrument to a holder for value, notwithstanding such holder at the time of 
taking the instrument knew the same to be only an accommodation party." (Act No. 
2031, sec. 29.)</p>
<p>We are of the opinion that the trial court misunderstood this definition. The 
accommodation to which reference is made in the section quoted is not one to the 
person who takes the note—that is, the payee or indorsee, but one to the maker 
or indorser of the note. It is true that in the case at bar it was an 
accommodation to the plaintiff, in a popular sense, to have the defendant 
indorse the note; but it was not the accommodation described in the law, but, 
rather, a mere favor to him and one which in no way bound Serrano. In cases of 
accommodation indorsement the indorser makes the indorsement for the 
accommodation of the maker. Such an indorsement is generally for the purpose of 
better securing the payment of the note—that is, he lends his name to the maker, 
not to the holder. Cutting it in another way: An accommodation note is one to 
which the accommodation party has put his name, without consideration, for the 
purpose of accommodating some other party who is to use it and is expected to 
pay it. The credit given to the accommodation party is sufficient consideration 
to bind the accommodation maker. Where, however, an indorsement is made as a 
favor to the indorsee, who requests it, not the better to secure payment, but to 
relieve himself from a distasteful situation, and where the only consideration 
for such indorsement passes from the indorser to the indorsee, the situation 
does not present one creating an accomodation indorsement, nor one where there 
is a consideration sufficient to sustain an action on the indorsement.</p>
<p>The prohibition in section 285 of the Code of Civil Procedure does not apply 
to a case like the one before us. The purpose of that prohibition is to prevent 
alteration, change, modification or contradiction of the <em>terms</em> of a 
written instrument, admittedly existing, by the use of parol evidence, except in 
the cases specifically named in the section. The case at bar is not one where 
the evidence offered varies, alters, modifies or contradicts the <em>terms</em> 
of the contract of indorsement admittedly existing. The evidence was not offered 
for that purpose. The purpose was to show that no contract of indorsement ever 
existed; that the minds of the parties never met on the terms of such a 
contract; that they never mutually agreed to enter into such a contract; and 
that there never existed a consideration upon which such an agreement could be 
founded. The evidence was not offered to vary, alter, modify, or contradict the 
terms of an agreement which it is admitted existed between the parties, but to 
<em>deny that there ever existed any agreement whatever;</em> to wipe out all 
apparent relations between the parties, and not to vary, alter or contradict the 
terms of a relation admittedly existing; in other words, the purpose of the 
parol evidence was to demonstrate, not that the indorser did not intend to make 
the <em>particular</em> indorsement which he did make; not that he did not 
intend to make the indorsement in the terms made; but, rather, to deny the 
reality of any indorsement; that a relation of <em>any kind whatever</em> was 
<em>created or existed between him and the indorsee</em> by reason of the 
writing on the back of the instrument; that no consideration ever passed to 
sustain an indorsement of any kind whatsoever.</p>
<p>The contention has some of the appearances of a case in which an indorser 
seeks to prove forgery. Where an indorser claims that his name was forged, it is 
clear that parol evidence is admissible to prove that fact, and, if he proves 
it, it is a complete defense, the fact being that the indorser never made any 
such contract, that no such relation ever existed between him and the indorsee, 
and that there was no consideration whatever to sustain such a contract. In the 
case before us we have a condition somewhat similar. While the indorser does not 
claim that his name was forged, he does claim that it was obtained from him in a 
manner which, between the parties themselves, renders the contract as completely 
inoperative as if it had been forged.</p>
<p>Parol evidence was admissible for the purposes named. There is no 
contradiction of the evidence offered by the defense and received provisionally 
by the court. Accepting it as true the judgment must be reversed.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from is reversed and the complaint dismissed on the 
merits; no special finding as to costs.</p>

<p>Act No. 2031, known as the Negotiable Instruments Law, which governs the 
present case, establishes various kinds of indorsements by means of which the 
liability of the indorser is in some manner limited, distinguishing it from that 
of the regular or general indorser, and among those kinds is that of the 
qualified indorsement which, pursuant to section 38 of the same Act, constitutes 
the indorser a mere assignor of the title to the instrument, and may be made by 
adding to the indorser's signature the words "without recourse" or any words of 
similar import.</p>
<p>If the defendant, Antonio G. Serrano, intervened, as he alleged and tried to 
prove that he did at the trial, only as a broker or agent between the lender and 
plaintiff, Maulini, and the makers of the promissory note, Padern, Moreno &amp; 
Co. and Angel Gimenez, in order to afford an opportunity to the former to invest 
the amount of the note in such manner that it might bring him interest, the 
defendant could have qualified the indorsement in question by adding to his 
signature the words "without recourse" or any others' such as would have made 
known in what capacity he intervened in that transaction. As the defendant did 
not do so and as he signed the indorsement in favor of the plaintiff Maulini for 
value received from the latter, his liability, according to section 66 of the 
Act aforecited, is that of a regular or general indorser, who, this same section 
provides, engages that if the instrument be dishonored, and the necessary 
proceedings on dishonor be duly taken, he will pay the amount thereof to the 
holder, or to any subsequent indorser who may be compelled to pay it. And the 
evidence which the defendant presented, tending to show what were the conditions 
to which he obligated himself and in what capacity he intervened in making that 
indorsement and that this latter was absolutely without consideration, should 
not have been admitted so that he might elude the aforesaid obligation, or, if 
admitted, should not be taken into account, because as a regular indorser he 
warranted, pursuant to the said section 66, that the instrument was genuine and 
in all respects what it purported to be, that he had a good title to it, and 
that it was at the time of his indorsement valid and subsisting. He cannot, 
therefore, by means of any evidence, and much less of such as consists of his 
own testimony, and as such interested party, alter, modify, contradict or annul, 
as he virtually claimed and claims to be entitled to do, what in writing and 
with a full and perfect knowledge of the meaning and import of the words 
contained in the indorse ment, he set forth therein over his signature.</p>
<p>Section 63 of the Act above cited says that a person placing his signature 
upon an instrument otherwise than as maker, drawer, or acceptor is deemed to be 
an indorser, unless he clearly indicates by appropriate words his intention to 
be bound in some other capacity. This provision of the law clearly indicates 
that in every negotiable instrument it is absolutely necessary to specify the 
capacity in which the person intervenes who is mentioned therein or takes part 
in its negotiation, because only by so doing can it be determined what 
liabilities arise from that intervention and from whom, how and when they must 
be exacted. And if, in the event of a failure to express the capacity in which 
the person who signed the negotiable instrument intended to be bound, he should 
be deemed to be an indorser, when the very words of the instrument expressly and 
conclusively show that such he is, as occurs in the present case, and when the 
indorsement contains no restriction, modification, condition or qualification 
whatever, there cannot be attributed to him, without violating the provisions of 
the said Act, any other intention than that of being bound in the capacity in 
which he appears in the instrument itself, nor can evidence be admitted or, if 
already admitted, taken into consideration, for the purpose of proving such 
other intention, for the simple reason that if the law has already fixed and 
determined the capacity in which it must be considered that the person who 
signed the negotiable instrument intervened and the intention of his being bound 
in a definite capacity, for no other purpose, undoubtedly, than that there shall 
be no evidence given in the matter, when that capacity appears in the instrument 
itself and the intention is determined by the very same capacity, as occurs in 
this case, the admission of evidence in reference thereto is entirely 
unnecessary, useless, and contrary to the purposes of the law, which is clear 
and precise in its provisions and admits of no subterfuges or evasions for 
escaping obligations contracted upon the basis of credit, with evident and sure 
detriment to those who intervened or took part in the negotiation of the 
instrument.</p>
<p>However, it is held in the majority opinion, for the purpose of sustaining 
the premise that the proofs presented by the defendant could have been admitted 
without violating the provisions of section 285 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 
that the evidence was not offered to vary, alter, modify, or contradict the 
terms of an agreement <em>which it is admitted existed between the parties, but 
to deny that there ever existed any agreement whatever; </em>to wipe out all 
apparent relations between the parties, and not to vary, alter or contradict the 
terms of a relation admittedly existing; in other words, the purpose of the 
parol evidence was to demonstrate, not that the indorser did not intend to make 
the <em>particular</em> indorsement which he did, not that he did not intend to 
make the indorsement in the terms made, but rather to deny the reality of 
<em>any</em> indorsement; to deny that a relation of <em>any kind whatsoever 
</em>was<em> created</em> <em>or existed between him and the indorsee</em> by 
reason of the writing on the back of the instrument; to deny that any 
consideration ever passed to sustain an indorsement of any kind whatsoever. It 
is stated in the same decision that the contention has some of the appearances 
of a case in which an indorser seeks to prove forgery.</p>
<p>First of all, we do not see that there exists any appearance or similarity 
whatever between the case at bar and one where forgery is sought to be proved. 
The defendant did not, either civilly or criminally, impugn the indorsement as 
being false. He admitted its existence, as stated in the majority opinion 
itself, and did not disown his signature written in the indorsement. His denial 
to the effect that the indorsement was wholly without consideration, aside from 
the fact that it is in contradiction to the statements that he over his 
signature made in the instrument, does not allow the supposition that the 
instrument was forged.</p>
<p>The meaning which the majority opinion apparently wishes to convey, in 
calling attention to the difference between what, as it says, was the purpose of 
the evidence presented by the defendant and what was sought to be proved 
thereby, is that the defendant does not endeavor to contradict or alter the 
terms of the agreement, which is contained in the instrument and is admitted to 
exist between the parties; but to deny the existence of such an agreement 
between them, that is, the existence of any indorsement at all, and that any 
consideration ever passed to sustain the said indorsement, or, in other words, 
that the defendant acknowledged the indorsement as regards the form in which it 
appears to have been drawn up, but not with respect to its essence, that is, to 
the truth of the particular facts set forth in the indorsement. It cannot be 
denied that the practical result of such evidence is other than to contradict, 
modify, alter or even to annul the terms of the agreement contained in the 
indorsement: so that, in reality, the distinction does not exist that is 
mentioned as a ground of the decision of the majority of the court in support of 
the opinion that the evidence in question might have been admitted, without 
violating the provisions of the aforementioned section 285 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure. This section is based upon the same principle which is taken into 
account in the Negotiable Instruments Law to write into it such positive and 
definite provisions which purport, without possibility of discussion or doubt, 
the uselessness of taking evidence when the capacity of the person who 
intervened in a negotiable instrument or his intention of being bound in a 
particular way appears in the instrument itself or has been fixed by statute, if 
it is not shown that he did so in some other capacity than that of maker, drawer 
or acceptor.</p>
<p>But, aside from what the Code of Civil Procedure prescribes with respect to 
this matter, as the present case is governed by the Negotiable Instruments Law, 
we must abide by its provisions.</p>
<p>Section 24 of this Act, No. 2031, says that every negotiable instrument is 
deemed <em>prima facie</em> to have been issued for a valuable consideration; 
and every person whose signature appears thereon, to have become a party thereto 
for value. If the Act establishes this presumption for the case where there 
might be doubt with respect to the existence of a valuable consideration, in 
order to avoid the taking of evidence in the matter, when the consideration 
appears from the instrument itself by the expression of the value, the 
introduction of evidence is entirely unnecessary and improper.</p>
<p>According to section 25 of the same Act, value is any consideration 
sufficient to support a simple contract, and so broad is the scope the law gives 
to the meaning of "value" in this kind of instruments that it considers as such 
a prior or preexistent debt, whether the instrument be payable on demand or at 
some future date.</p>
<p>Section 26 provides that where value has at any time been given for the 
instrument, the holder is deemed a holder for value in respect to all parties 
who became such prior to that time. It is unquestionable that the defendant gave 
the P3,000 for the instrument, and, for the purpose of the plaintiff's being 
considered a holder for value, both in respect to the maker and to the defendant 
indorser, it is immaterial whether he did so directly to the person who appears 
in the promissory note as the maker or whether he delivered the sum to the 
defendant in order that this latter might in turn, deliver it to the maker.</p>
<p>The defendant being" the holder of the instrument, he is also unquestionably 
the holder in due course. In the first place, in order to avoid doubts with 
respect to this matter, which might require the introduction of evidence, the 
Act before mentioned has provided, in section 59, that every holder is deemed 
<em>prima facie</em> to be a holder in due course, and such is the weight it 
gives to this presumption and to the consequences derived therefrom, that it 
imposes upon the holder the burden to prove that he or some person under whom he 
claims acquired the title in due course, only when it is shown that the title of 
any person who has negotiated the instrument was defective. This rule, however, 
pursuant to the said section, does not apply in favor of a party who became 
bound on the instrument prior to the acquisition of such defective title, in 
which case the defendant Serrano is not included, because, in the first place, 
he was not bound on the instrument prior to the acquisition of the title by the 
plaintiff, but it was the maker of the promissory note who was bound on the 
instrument executed in favor of the defendant or indorser prior to the 
acquisition of the title by the plaintiff; and, in the second place, it does not 
appear, nor was it proved, as will be seen hereinafter, that the title in 
question was defective.</p>
<p>According to section 52 of the same Act, the plaintiff is the holder in due 
course of the instrument in question, that is, of the promissory note containing 
the obligation compliance with which is demanded of him by the defendant, 
because he took the instrument under the conditions: (<em>a</em>) That it was 
complete and regular upon its face; (<em>b</em>) that he became the holder of it 
before it was overdue, and without notice that it had been previously 
dishonored; (<em>c</em>) that he took it in good faith and for value; and 
(<em>d</em>) that at the time it was negotiated to hini he had no notice of any 
deficiency in the instrument or defect in the title of the person negotiating 
it.</p>
<p>Pursuant to section 56 of the said Act, to constitute notice of a deficiency 
in the instrument or defect in the title of the person negotiating,the same, the 
person to whom it is transferred must have had actual knowledge of the 
deficiency or defect, or knowledge of such facts that his action in taking the 
instrument amounted to bad faith.</p>
<p>In the present case it cannot be said, for it is not proven, that the 
plaintiff, upon accepting the instrument from the defendant, had actual 
knowledge of any deficiency or defect in the same, for the simple reason that it 
contains no deficiency or defect. Its terms are very clear and positive. There 
is nothing ambiguous, concealed, or which might give rise to any doubt whatever 
with respect to its terms or to the agreement made by the parties. Furthermore, 
as stated in the majority opinion, the defendant did not intend to make the 
particular indorsement which he did make in the terms, form and manner in which 
it was made, nor did he intend to change or alter the terms of the agreement 
which is admitted to have existed between the parties. All of which indicates 
that, neither as regards the plaintiff nor as regards the defendant, was there 
any deficiency or defect in the title or in the instrument, and that the 
plaintiff, upon taking or receiving the instrument from the defendant, had no 
knowledge of any fact from which bad faith on his part might be implied. 
Besides, no evidence was produced of the existence of any such bad faith, nor of 
the knowledge of any deficiency or defect.</p>
<p>Moreover, section 55 of Act No. 2031 provides that the title of a person who 
negotiates an instrument is defective within the meaning of this Act when he 
obtained the instrument, or any signature thereto, by fraud, duress, or force 
and fear, or other unlawful means, or for an illegal consideration, or when he 
negotiates it in breach of faith, or under such circumstances as amount to a 
fraud. As no evidence was taken on these points, the only ones that may be 
proven as regards negotiable instruments, the defendant must be deemed to be the 
holder of the instrument in due course, pursuant to the provisions of the 
aforecited section 59, and he cannot be required to prove that he or his 
predecessor in interest acquired the title as such holder in due course.</p>
<p>Now then, according to section 28 of the same Act, as against the holder of 
the instrument in due course absence or failure of consideration is not a matter 
of defense; and, pursuant to section 57, a holder in due course holds the 
instrument free from any defect of title of prior parties, and free from 
defenses available to prior parties among themselves, and may enforce payment of 
the instrument for the full amount thereof against all parties liable thereon. 
And the next section, No. 58 prescribes that in the hands of any holder other 
than a holder in due course, a negotiable instrument is subject to the same 
defenses as if it were nonnegotiable.</p>
<p>So it could not be clearer than that, pursuant to the provisions of the 
Negotiable Instruments Law, which governs the case at bar, as the plaintiff is 
the holder in due course of the instrument in question, no proof whatever from 
the defendant could be admitted, nor if admitted should be taken into account, 
bearing on the lack of consideration in the indorsement, as alleged by him, and 
for the purpose of denying the existence of any indorsement and that any 
relation whatever was created or existed between him and the indorsee; likewise, 
that no defenses of any kind could have been admitted from the defendant in 
respect to the said instrument, and, finally, that the defendant is obligated to 
pay the sum mentioned in the said indorsement, it being immaterial whether or 
not he be deemed to be an accommodation party in the instrument, in order that 
compliance with the said obligation may be required of him in his capacity of 
indorser.</p>
<p>Basing our conclusions on the foregoing grounds, and regretting to dissent 
from the opinion of the majority of our colleagues, we believe that the judgment 
appealed from should be affirmed, with the costs against the appellant. </p>
