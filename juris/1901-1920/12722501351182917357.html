				<H3>IN RE R. MCCULLOCH DICK.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The petitioner, R. McCulloch Dick, prays for his discharge from detention by 
the acting chief of police of the city of Manila, who took him in custody under 
authority of an executive order, a copy of which is set out in the body of this 
opinion.
<p>A writ of habeas corpus was issued by one of the members of this court upon 
the following1 representations of the petitioner:</p>
<p>"(1) That he is unlawfully restrained of his liberty.</p>
<p>"(2) That he is so unlawfully restrained of his liberty by Anton Hohmann, 
acting chief of police of the city of Manila.</p>
<p>"(3) That the place where he is so restrained is the city of Manila, 
Philippine Islands.</p>
<p>"(4) That the cause of his detention is an order issued by the 
Governor-General of the Philippine Islands in accordance with the provisions of 
section 69 of the Administrative Code (Act No. 2711), a true copy of such order 
being hereunto annexed, marked Exhibit A and made a part of this petition, as 
well as the proceedings on which said order of deportation was based and issued, 
a copy whereof is also attached, marked Exhibit B and made a part of this 
petition.</p>
<p>"(5) That the said detention and restraint are illegal and that the 
illegality thereof consists in this, to wit:</p>
<p>"That the Governor-General of the Philippine Islands had no authority to 
issue such order of deportation, and that such order of deportation is in 
violation of the Constitution, treaties, and laws of the United States, and of 
the Law of Nations, in force in the Philippine Islands.</p>
<p>"(6) That the petitioner is not restrained of his liberty nor is he in the 
custody of an officer under process issued by a court or magistrate, or by 
virtue of a judgment or order of a court of record."</p>
<p>The executive order referred to in the petition is couched in the following 
terms:</p>
<p align="center">"Office of the Governor-General of the <br>Philippine 
Islands.</p>
<p><em>"To the Chief of Police, city of Manila, or to any peace 
officer.</em></p>
<p>Greeting: Whereas, after an investigation duly conducted in accordance with 
the provisions of section 69 of the Administrative Code (Act No. 2711), it 
appears that R. McCulloch Dick is a subject of a foreign power, residing in the 
Philippine Islands;</p>
<p>"Whereas it further appears that said R. McCulloch Dick is an undesirable 
alien, whose presence in the Philippine Islands is a menace to the peace and 
safety of the community ;</p>
<p>"Now, therefore, by virtue of the powers in me vested, you are hereby 
authorized and ordered to deport said R. McCulloch Dick to the neighboring 
Colony of Hongkong, and thereafter to exclude him from these Islands.</p>
<p>"In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the 
Government of the Philippine Islands to be affixed.</p>
<p>"Done at the city of Manila this 18th day of March, in the year of our Lord 
nineteen hundred and eighteen.</p>

<p>The record of the proceedings had in the course of the investigation referred 
to in the executive order is before us, and discloses that a "hearing" was 
conducted by Colonel D. P. Quinlan, Inspector General of the Philippine National 
Guard, Commissioner, under the following authority:</p>
<p align="center">"Office of the Governor-General of the <br>Philippine 
Islands.</p>
<p align="right"><em>"February 23, 1918.</em></p>
<p>"Sir : Pursuant to authority vested in me by section sixty-nine of Act 2711, 
known as the Administrative Code of 1917, you are hereby designated as the agent 
of the Governor-General for the purpose of investigating and reporting upon 
charges which have been preferred against R. McCulloch Dick, the editor and 
proprietor of the Philippines Free Press, a periodical published weekly in the 
city of Manila, in connection with the publication of certain articles in that 
paper which tend to obstruct the Government of the Philippine Islands in 
policies inaugurated for the prosecution of the war between the United States 
and the German Empire, and other articles which have tended to create a feeling 
of unrest and uneasiness in the community. It is desired that you submit your 
report of this investigation to the Governor-General at the earliest possible 
date.</p>
<p>"Very respectfully.</p>
<p align="right">(Sgd.) "Francis Burton 
Harrison,<br><em>"Governor-General</em></p>
<p>"Colonel D. P. Quinlan,<br><em>Philippine National Guard, Manila."</em></p>
<p>It further appears that on February 25, 1918, notice in writing that a 
hearing would be had in pursuance of the above-cited executive order on March 1, 
1918, was duly served upon, and accepted by the petitioner; that the petitioner 
was present at the hearing, and was heard by himself and counsel; that he 
produced witnesses in his own behalf, and was allowed to cross-examine the 
opposing witnesses; and that at the conclusion of the hearing, counsel for the 
petitioner made the following statement:</p>
<p>"I want to thank the Commissioner for his courtesy throughout the matter. I 
am sure that his conduct has been absolutely impartial, and I have no complaint 
to make. I don't know how the investigation could have been conducted along 
fairer broader lines, than it has been conducted, and I am sure that Colonel 
Quinlan's standing as an Army officer will not be at all prejudiced by anything 
he has done or what has occurred at this investigation."</p>
<p>These summary proceedings were set in motion by a complaint filed by a number 
of officers of the National Guard, in the form of a protest as follows:</p>
<p>"Whereas the weekly 'Free Press' has for sometime been devoting its columns 
to a malicious campaign of discredit against the National Guard and its 
officials;</p>
<p>"Whereas the National Guard represents one of the most noble ideals of the 
Filipino people and one of the most sincere proofs of the loyalty of this 
country to the cause of the United States;</p>
<p>"Whereas this campaign of defamation and discredit carried out by the said 
weekly, published and edited by Americans, tends to belittle the National Guard 
and might in its effects, create discord between Americans and Filipinos, just 
at the moment that the latter have staked its honor and its word with America in 
this war;</p>
<p>"Whereas even admitting that in the ranks of the National Guard there may 
exist some soldiers who with their actions dishonor the uniform they wear—which 
after all occurs in every human institution even the most sacred—the campaign of 
the Free Press could not be considered as an honest one, but this weekly is in 
fact pouring distrust and sarcasm of the most venemous character;</p>
<p>"Whereas the Free Press in reporting certain dishonorable acts of certain 
soldiers has not taken the pains to inquire as to the penalty which the rules 
apply to those who do not honor the uniform, thus doing rank injustice to the 
authorities of the National Guard and the good name of this organization;</p>
<p>"Whereas the habitual malign conduct of the Free Press in its campaigns of 
discredit renders its ratifications to be as meaningless as its attacks;</p>
<p>"Be it therefore resolved, that an energetic protest be made, as it is hereby 
made, admitting of no rectifications, against the base conduct of the weekly 
Free Press and to denounce its attitude before the Government and the entire 
community of the Philippines as showing this weekly to be the worst enemy of the 
people's ideals and of the National Guard, in using its columns to humiliate not 
only before the eyes of strangers but of the Filipinos as well, the National 
Guard in its period of formation and development.</p>
<p align="center">[Translated from the original in Spanish.]</p>
<p>The specific charges upon which the investigation was based will be found in 
the following copy of the notice served upon the petitioner at the outset of the 
proceedings;</p>
<p align="right">"121 Arzobispo, Manila, P. I.,<br><em>"February 23, 
1918.</em></p>
<p>"Mr. R. McCulloch Dick,<br><em>"Editor and proprietor, Philippines Free 
Press, Manila, P. I.</em></p>
<p>"Sir : The attention of His Excellency the Governor-General of the Philippine 
Islands has been called to certain articles appearing in the Philippines Free 
Press, a periodical published in the city of Manila in which you appear as 
editor and proprietor. Aside from those matters in your previous issues relevant 
to show inclination or intent, the particular matter which is referred to him as 
a charge against you is that contained in articles in the issue of the Press of 
February 16, 1918, in connection with National Guard.</p>
<p>"The specific publications forming the basis of these charges appear in 
column 1, on page 1 of the issue of February 16, 1918, and in the opening 
paragraph of the second column of page sixteen of the same issue. The allegation 
being that the indictment contained therein is not only a wholesale untruth but 
that its publication even in the event of guilt of individuals,—a condition not 
proven—the arraignment of a body of citizens of the Philippine Islands included 
in its military force, is without warrant, and also that in view of the fact 
that the United States Government is a belligerent in the present war, and that 
the Congress of the United States having authorized the use of this force, your 
attempt tends not only to bring it into ridicule but also is an unjust, 
unlawful, malicious, and essentially seditious publication, and cannot be 
considered other than as prima facie tending to obstruct the Government of the 
Philippine Islands in the formation of measures inaugurated for the prosecution 
of the war between the United States and the German Empire, and its policies 
with respect to these nations and peoples associated with it in the performance 
of the war objects.</p>
<p>"Pursuant to authority vested in His Excellency the Governor-General of the 
Philippine Islands, by section 69 of Act 2711, known as the Administrative Code 
of 1917, the undersigned has been designated as the agent of the 
Governor-General for the purpose of investigating and reporting upon your 
conduct and responsibility in connection with the publication of these articles, 
which I am directed to have you consider as forming the basis of charges lodged 
against you with the Governor-General, the publication of which it is charged, 
that to obstruct the Government of the Philippine Islands in policies 
inaugurated for the prosecution of the war between the United States and the 
German Empire, and that these specific publications with other articles in your 
paper in criticism of the allied efforts in prosecution of this war, or the 
policies of our associates in this war all of which apparently show that your 
interest in publishing the latter articles obstructs the Government of the 
United States and tends to create a feeling of unrest and uneasiness in the 
community, and marks the party responsible for the policies and declarations in 
your paper as being designatedly hostile to the paramount interests of the power 
exercising sovereignty in these Islands and the measures of the Philippine 
people inaugurated to support those policies.</p>
<p>"As the procedure prescribed by section sixty-nine of the Administrative Code 
is to be observed in this particular case, I take the liberty of quoting it here 
in full:</p>
<p>" 'SEC. 69. <em>Deportation of subject of a foreign power</em>.— A subject of 
a foreign power residing in the Philippine Islands shall not be deported, 
expelled, or excluded from said Islands or repatriated to his own country by the 
Governor-General except upon prior investigation, conducted by said executive or 
his authorized agent, of the ground upon which such action is contemplated. In 
such case the person concerned shall be informed of the charge or charges 
against him and he shall be allowed not less than three days for the preparation 
of his defense. He shall also have the right to be heard by himself or counsel, 
to produce witnesses in his own behalf, and to cross-examine the opposing 
witnesses.'</p>
<p>"I will conduct this hearing in the Office of the Adjutant-General of the 
National Guard at 121 Calle Arzobispo of this city, Friday morning at 9 o'clock, 
March 1, 1918; said hearing to continue throughout the day until completed. My 
function, you are advised, is solely administrative and confined to a hearing of 
and a report upon the facts.</p>
<p align="right">(Sgd.) "D. P. Q.,<br>"Dennis P. Quinlan, <em>Colonel and 
Inspector General</em>,<br>N. G., P. I."</p>
<p>One of the articles, upon which these charges were based appeared on the 
first page of the Philippine Free Press of February 16, 1918, under a striking 
cartoon giving point to the contents. It is as follows:</p>
<p>"It hasn't come yet, but it is expected soon, that call of President Wilson 
which will incorporate the Philippine National Guard in the national forces of 
the United States. And, when it comes, look out! For it brings with it an 
increase of the base pay of a soldier of the Guard from P12 a month to P60 a 
month, and clothes and chow, and, my! what chow! The best in the world! For 
Uncle Sam thinks nothing too good for his soldier boys.</p>
<p>"And you just watch 'em when the call comes. Talk about a dearth of patriots 
for the Guard! Why, the moment the news gets around that you can get P60 a month 
and your belly full by enlisting, just see them come—see them streak for the 
recruiting office! Behold the cocinero drops his frying-pan, the muchacho his 
dishrag, the cochero his whip, the cargador his pinga, the escribiente his pen, 
the farmhand his bolo. See them hit the high places! For who, after slaving for 
eight and nine and ten and fifteen and twenty pesos a month Wouldn't jump at the 
chance to be a soldier and carry a gun and have a fine and easy time at pesos 
sixty! Talk about manna from the skies! Talk about the world with a fence around 
it! Talk about heaven on earth! Talk about Jay Gould and Carnegie and Rothschild 
and Rockefeller! Piff!</p>
<p>"Flanders mud, you say, and being blown to pieces with a big Black Maria? 
Why, at P60 a month our Juans and Pedros and Dalmacios will eat Flanders and 
dance ragtime to the tune of the Black Marias.</p>
<p>"If ever that call come there is going to be one great and awful time here. 
And there is going to be some tall swearing in proud Castillian. For the market 
in cocheros and muchachos and cocineros is going to be tight as a drum and they 
will simply turn up their noses disdainfully at anything less than the wages of 
the Guard—P60 a month. What ho! the Guard!"</p>
<p>The second article to which specific reference was made by Colonel Quinlan 
was published in the editorial column of the same issue of the Free Press, and 
is as follows:</p>
<p align="center">KNOW HOW TO FORAGE.</p>
<p>"If the men of the Philippine National Guard can fight like they can steal 
then the Kaiser and his legions had better beat it before the boys from the 
Philippine are sent 'over there.' The details of the first case which appeared 
in the papers have slipped us now. It was not long thereafter, however, till 
there was recorded the Manila Hotel case, where the turkeys kept disappearing. 
When the watch was set during the night and the thief caught—National Guard! 
Then there was the case of a candidate for a commission as officer of the Guard. 
Took off his coat, he did, to be measured for the physical test. When he came to 
put it on again, lo, his watch was gone. Again a guardsman! The latest 
testimonial to the Guards' ability to get away with things comes from the 
Carnival! When the cakes mysteriously disappeared from the Tea Cup Inn on the 
last night of the big festival, it was to the tent of the sentries that the 
telltale tracks led, and there were found the crumbs of the midnight feast. 
Again the Guard! In one of Shakespeare's plays there is mention of three soldier 
rogues in buckram. The guard is not in buckram, but apparently it has its 
rogues."</p>
<p>It is agreed on all sides, and expressly admitted by counsel for the 
petitioner, that if the Governor-General of the Philippine Islands has power to 
deport aliens as an act of state; and if he has followed the procedure marked 
out for the exercise of that power in section 69 of the Administrative Code; and 
if the petitioner is a "subject of a foreign power;" this court has no power to 
interfere with or to control the action of the Governor-General in ordering the 
deportation of the petitioner.</p>
<p>If the discretionary power to deport aliens, as an act of state, has been 
conferred upon the Governor-General, to be exercised by him upon his own opinion 
as to whether the facts disclosed by an investigation had in accord with section 
69 of the Administrative Code, justify or necessitate deportation in a 
particular case, he is the sole and exclusive judge of the existence of those 
facts, and no other tribunal is at liberty to reexamine or to controvert the 
sufficiency of the evidence on which he acted. (Martin <em>vs</em>. Mott [1827], 
12 Wheat., 19, 31.)</p>
<p>Upon both principle and authority the proposition thus stated is not open to 
question (Cf. Severino <em>vs</em>. The Governor-General of the Philippine 
Islands and Provincial Board of Occidental Negros, 16 Phil. Rep., 366, and cases 
there cited); and although it has been suggested that the power of the courts to 
review the action of the Chief Executive is subject to further limitations, we 
do not deem it necessary to consider or to determine at this time the precise 
line of demarcation of judicial and executive authority in cases such as that 
now under consideration, because we are satisfied that the petitioner's prayer 
for discharge from custody must be denied upon the specific grounds which he 
himself admits to be sufficient, if they exist, to deprive us of power to 
interfere with or to control the action of the Governor-General in ordering his 
deportation.</p>
<p>We are of opinion that the Governor-General of the Philippine Islands has 
power to deport aliens as an act of state, "upon prior investigation" conducted 
in the manner and form prescribed in section 69 of the Administrative Code; that 
in ordering the deportation of the petitioner he followed the procedure marked 
out for the exercise of that power in section 69 of the Administrative Code; and 
that the petitioner is a "subject of a foreign power" as that term is used in 
this section of the code.</p>
<p>We shall take up each of these propositions for consideration separately, but 
for convinience, they will be examined in inverse order.</p>
<p>(1) <em>Petitioner is a "subject of a foreign power" as that term is used in 
section 69 of the Administrative Code.</em></p>
<p>The record discloses and it is expressly admitted that petitioner was born in 
Scotland, a subject of His Britannic Majesty the King of England; that he came 
to the United States during his minority; that he declared his intention to 
renounce his allegiance to the King of England and to become a citizen of the 
United States in the year 1902, in a court of competent jurisdiction in the 
State of New York; that not long thereafter he came to the Philippine Islands 
and has continued to reside here ever since; that in the year 1912, after having 
been denied an American passport, he secured a British passport from the British 
Consul-General in Manila, and travelled under its protection in the United 
States and Europe; that on that occasion he visited his old home in Scotland; 
and that since declaring his intention to become a citizen of the United States, 
in the year 1902, he has taken no further steps looking to his naturalization 
other than to maintain his domicile, and to continue to reside within the 
territory of the United States.</p>
<p>We are of opinion that any such rights as the petitioner may have acquired by 
virtue of the declaration of his intention to become a citizen, fifteen years 
ago, have been lost by the lapse of time without taking any further steps to 
become naturalized, and by his acceptance and use of a British passport in the 
year 1912; and we are of opinion, further, that he did not cease to be an alien 
and a subject of a foreign state by virtue of his mere declaration of intention 
to become a citizen of the United States.</p>
<p>It would seem unnecessary to enter upon an extended discussion of the grounds 
upon which we rest our conclusions in this regard, and we content ourselves with 
some citations of textbook and other authority which, as we think, sufficiently 
dispose of all the contentions of counsel for the petitioner upon this branch of 
the case.</p>
<p><em>"Effect of declaration of intention</em>.—Though mere declaration of 
intention in no wise confers citizenship or absolves the party making it from 
allegiance to the Government of the country from which he comes, yet our 
Secretary of State is authorized by Act of Congress to issue passports, at his 
discretion, to persons who are not fully naturalized in certain cases." 
(Hershey's International Law, pp. 251-2; sec. 1, Act of March 2, 1907.)</p>
<p>The Act of Congress referred to provides:</p>
<p>"Where any person has made a declaration of intention to become such a 
citizen as provided by law, and has resided in the United States for three 
years, a passport may be issued to him entitling him to the protection of the 
Government in any foreign country: <em>Provided</em>, That such passport shall 
not be valid for more than six months and shall not be renewed, and that such 
passport shall not entitle the holder to the protection of this Government in 
the country of which he was a citizen prior to making such declaration of 
intention." (Sec. 1 of Act of March 2, 1907.)</p>
<p>"Clearly, an alien is not naturalized until the order divesting him of his 
former nationality and making him a citizen of the United States has been signed 
by a judge of a court having jurisdiction." (26 Ops. Atty. Gen., [1906-1908] 
612.)</p>
<p>"A mere 'declaration of intention' by an alien, under the naturalization laws 
of the United States, to become a citizen, &amp;c., and to renounce all 
allegiance to a foreign, his natural sovereign, in a judicial point of view, is 
not sufficient of itself, and without being perfected by an actual renunciation, 
to prevent such alien from being regarded as a 'foreign citizen or subject,' * * 
* ." (Baird <em>vs</em>. Byrne [C. C, 1853] Fed, Cas. No. 757.)</p>
<p>"A foreign-born resident of the United States, who has merely declared his 
intention to become a citizen, but has never complied with any other provision 
of the naturalization laws, is none the less an alien," although he may have 
been given the right to vote by state laws. (City of Minneapolis <em>vs</em>. 
Reum [1893], 56 Fed., 576, 6 C. C. A., 31.)</p>
<p>"A declaration of intention to become a citizen of the United States does not 
make one a naturalized citizen." (Creagh <em>vs</em>. Equitable Life Assur. Soc. 
[C. C, 1898], 88 Fed., 1; 11 U. S. Compiled Statutes, 1916, Ann., 14034.)</p>
<p>"An alien's declaration of his intention to become a citizen of the United 
States did not make him a citizen, he never having taken out his naturalization 
papers." (Minneapolis <em>vs</em>. Reum [1893], 56 Fed., 576, 578; 6 C. C. A., 
31; Wallenburg <em>vs</em>. Missouri Pac. Ry. Co. [C. C, 1908], 159 Fed., 217; 
<em>In re</em> Polsson, Id., 283; Dorsey <em>vs</em>. Brigham [1898], 52 N. E., 
303; 177, 111., 250; 42 L. R. A., 809; 69 Am. St. Rep., 228; State <em>vs</em>. 
Collister [1905], 27 Ohio Cir. Ct. R., 529.)</p>
<p>"Mere declaration of intention does not confer citizenship upon the 
declarant. The declaration is merely an expression of purpose, and has not the 
effect, either of naturalization or expatriation. By it the alien simply records 
his intention to renounce his present allegiance on becoming a citizen of the 
United States. He remains an alien until naturalization is complete according to 
our laws." (Lans <em>vs</em>. Randall, 4 Dill., 425; Fed. Cas. No. 8,080; Maloy 
<em>vs</em>. Duden, 25 Fed., 673; <em>Re Moses</em>, 82 Fed., 995.)</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<p>"While the laws of several of the states of the Union extend the right of 
suffrage to aliens who have declared their intention to become citizens of the 
United States, a State cannot make the subject of a foreign government a citizen 
of the United States, or confer on him the rights and privileges appertaining to 
such citizenship.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<p>"A state may confer on foreign citizens or subjects all the rights and 
privileges it has the power to bestow, but when it has done all this, it has not 
naturalized them. They are foreign citizens or subjects still, within the 
meaning of the Constitution and laws of the United States. See also Boyd 
<em>vs</em>. Nebraska, 143 U. S., 160; 36 L. ed., 109; 12 Sup. Ct. Rep., 375." 
(Van Dyne Citizenship of the U. S., pp. 66-67.)</p>
<p>"The provision of the Naturalization Act of June 29, 1906, c. 3592, 84, 34 
Stat, 596 [U. S. Comp. St. Supp. 1907, p. 421], requiring a petition for 
naturalization to be filed not less than two nor more than seven years after the 
declaration of intention is in the nature of a statute of limitation, and since 
it contains no language indicating a contrary intention must be so construed as 
not to cut off the privilege of aliens who had made declaration of intention 
prior to its enactment to become citizens, but in such cases to give them seven 
years thereafter within which to file their petition." (<em>In re</em> Wehrli 
[D. C, 1907], 157 Fed., 938; Eichhorst <em>vs</em>. Lindsay [D. C, 1913], 209 
Fed., 708; U. S. <em>vs</em>. Lengyel [D. C, 1915], 220 Fed., 720; 5 U. S. 
Compiled Statutes [1916], 5224.)</p>
<p>Rules governing the granting and issuing of passports to those who have 
declared their intention to become citizens of the United States:</p>
<p>"(1) The first section of the Act approved March 2, 1907, 'in reference to 
the expatriation of citizens and their protection abroad,' provides That the 
Secretary of State shall be authorized, in his discretion, to issue passports to 
persons <em>not citizens of the United States</em> as follows: Where any person 
has made a declaration of intention to become such a citizen as provided by law 
and has resided in the United States for three years, a passport may be issued 
to him entitling him to the protection of this Government in any foreign 
country; <em>Provided</em>, That such passport shall not be valid for more than 
six months and shall not be renewed, and that such passport shall not entitle 
the holder to the protection of this Government in the country of which he was a 
citizen prior to making such declaration of intention.'</p>
<p>"(2) This section is not intended to confer upon persons who have only 
declared their intention to <em>become citizens</em> a general right to receive 
passports upon application. Such passports will be issued only when it is 
affirmatively shown to the Secretary of State that some special exigency 
requires the temporary absence of the applicant from the United States, and that 
without such absence the applicant would be subjected to special hardship or 
injury. Under this law passports cannot be issued to declarants who intend 
visiting their native lands.</p>
<p>"(3) Such passports will not be issued to those who have made the declaration 
of intention and who have failed, through their own neglect, to complete their 
intention and secure naturalization as citizens of the United States; nor to 
those who may make the declaration of intention in order to secure passports and 
leave the United States, nor shall more than one such passport be issued to any 
applicant.</p>
<p>"(4) It is therefore ordered that before a passport shall be issued to anyone 
who has made the declaration of intention to become a citizen of the United 
States the following facts shall be established to the satisfaction of the 
Secretary of State:</p>
<p>"(<em>f</em>) That the applicant has not applied for or obtained a passport 
from any other Government since he declared his intention to become a citizen of 
the United States.</p>

States in 1850, that he had since continuously resided in the latter country, 
and that in 1859, he declared his intention to become a citizen of the United 
States. The United States demurred to the memorial on the ground, among others, 
that the claimant was not a British subject within the true meaning of the 
treaty; that the declaration of intention was, 'of itself,' 'a complete 
renunciation of all claims upon the intervention or protection of the sovereign' 
whose allegiance he had announced his intention to abjure; that this declaration 
by the laws of many, if not all of the United States, gave him, of itself, many 
of the rights of a citizen; that it certainly put him, so long as he remained in 
the United States, under the protection of that Government for international 
purposes; that in the case of Koszta it was asserted by the United States as a 
sufficient ground for protection even while abroad; and that it subjected the 
claimant, by the laws and usages of the United States, to conscription and 
enrollment for military service.</p>
<p>"Counsel for Great Britain replied that the claimant's declaration of 
intention worked 'no change in his status under the law of nations;' that the 
intention so declared might be abandoned at pleasure; that while it 'might 
furnish to his sovereign a sufficient reason to decline interference in his 
behalf,' it 'did not purport to bring him under any new obligation to the 
country which he then intended to adopt;' that the British Government had not 
declined to protect him, but on the contrary presented his claim for indemnity; 
that the declaration gave him no right 'as a citizen of the United States;' that 
the rights which might result under State laws did not affect his condition as 
an alien; that he could not so much as claim from the United States a passport 
for his protection abroad; that the case of Koszta was without precedent, and 
had been repudiated by the United States itself, so far as it had been appealed 
to as recognizing the right of persons by virtue of a declaration of intention 
to be considered as citizens of the United States; that the statute of the 
United States authorizing the conscription of such persons did not pretend to 
change their allegiance, and gave them no rights or privileges in consequences 
of the conscription."</p>
<p>Similar facts and arguments were presented in other cases. The commissioners 
unanimously rendered the following opinion:</p>
<p>" 'The question is raised as to whether in consequence of the claimants 
having declared their intention to become citizens of the United States and to 
renounce their allegiance to Her Britannic Majesty they have ceased to be 
British subjects within the meaning of the treaty. We are of opinion that 
notwithstanding the claimants having expressed their intention, they still 
remain British subjects until, the necessary formalities having been completed, 
they acted upon the intention so expressed.'" (<em>See Hale's Report, 14 Am. and 
British Claims Commission, treaty of May 8, 1871;</em> Moore, International 
Arbitrations, Vol. 3, pp. 2552-2553.)</p>
<p>By the Act of Congress approved March 2, 1907, the right of expatriation is 
expressly declared, and all claims that <em>naturalized American citizens</em>, 
with their descendants, continue to be subjects of foreign states, are "finally 
disavowed;" and the Secretary of State is authorized, in his discretion, to 
issue passports to certain persons "not citizens of the United States," 
including under certain conditions "any person who has made a declaration of 
intention to become such citizens." But the express disavowal of claims that 
naturalized citizens continue to be subjects of foreign states after their 
naturalization, considered together with the omission of any such disavowal as 
to persons who have merely declared their intention to become such citizens; and 
the restrictions and limitations placed upon the rights and privileges of such 
persons, especially the prohibition upon the issuance to them of passports to 
visit their native lands, quite clearly disclose the recognition on the part of 
Congress of the settled doctrine of International Law that an alien does not 
cease to be an alien and a subject of a foreign state, by the mere declaration 
of his intention to become a citizen of the United States.</p>
<p>The right of expatriation is declared in the Act in the following 
language:</p>
<p>"Whereas the right of expatriation is a natural and inherent right of all 
people, indispensable to the enjoyment of the rights of the life, liberty, and 
the pursuit of happiness ; and whereas in the recognition of this principle this 
Government has freely received emigrants from all nations, and invested them 
with the rights of citizenship; and whereas it is claimed that such American 
citizens, with their descendants, are subjects of foreign states, owing 
allegiance to the governments thereof; and whereas it is necessary to the 
maintenance of public peace that this claim of foreign allegiance should be 
promptly and finally disavowed: Therefore any declaration, instruction, opinion, 
order, or decision of any officer of the United States which denies, restricts, 
impairs, or questions the right of expatriation, is declared inconsistent with 
the fundamental principles of the Republic." (United States Compiled Statutes, 
1916, vol. 4, pp. 3952-3955.)</p>
<p>(2) <em>The procedure marked out in section 69 of the Administrative Code of 
1917, for the exercise by the Governor- General of the power to deport, has been 
followed in every particular in the instant case</em>.</p>
<p>As we understand it, there is no divergence of opinion among the members of 
the court as to this proposition. Certainly we have heard none. Extended 
discussion is therefore unnecessary.</p>
<p>A cursory examination of the record, or of the admitted facts set out in the 
statement of the case at the beginning of this opinion, will remove all doubt in 
this regard.</p>
<p>(3) <em>The Governor-General of the Philippine Islands has power to deport 
aliens, as an act of state, upon prior investigation conducted in the manner and 
form prescribed in section 69 of the Administrative Code.</em></p>
<p>Resting our conclusion in this regard upon the provisions of section 69 of 
the Administrative Code of 1917, read in the light of the rulings of the Supreme 
Court of the United States in the case of Tiaco <em>vs</em>. Forbes (228 U. S., 
551), it is not necessary, at this time, to determine whether, under the various 
organic acts of the Philippine Government, the power to deport aliens, as an act 
of state, is vested in the Governor-General "by virtue of his office alone," 
subject merely to regulation by the Philippine Legislature; or whether his 
authority in the premises is derived wholly from the Philippine Legislature by 
virtue of a grant of power, express or implied, in section 69 of the 
Administrative Code of 1917; because deportations of aliens by the 
Governor-General, as an act of state, upon prior investigation conducted in the 
manner and form prescribed in section 69 of the Administrative Code may properly 
be regarded as made "under the combined powers" of the Governor-General and the 
Philippine Legislature; authority for such deportations having been conferred 
upon the Governor-General, so far as that may be necessary, by the provisions of 
that section, as we believe and shall endeavor to show hereafter.</p>
<p>We may, therefore, dispose of most of the contentions of counsel for 
petitioner as to the lack of power of the Governor-General in the premises, in 
the very language of the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Tiaco 
<em>vs</em>. Forbes (228, U. S. 549) :</p>
<p>"The deportation is to be considered as having been ordered by the 
Governor-General in pursuance of a statute of the Philippine Legislature 
directing it, under their combined powers, and <em>it is unnecessary to consider 
whether he had authority by virtue of his office alone, as declared by the 
statute, or whether, if he had not, he had immunity from suit for such an 
official act done in good faith</em>. The former matter now is regulated by a 
later statute providing for a hearing, etc. (No. 2113. February 1, 1912.) On the 
question thus narrowed the preliminaries are plain. It is admitted that 
sovereign states have inherent power to deport aliens, and seemingly that 
Congress is not deprived of this power by the Constitution of the United States. 
(Fong Yue Ting <em>vs</em>. United States, 149 U. S., 698, 707s 728; Wong Wing 
<em>vs</em>. United States, 185 U. S., 296, 302; Turner <em>vs</em>. Williams, 
194 U. S., 279, 289, 290.) Furthermore, the very ground to the power in the 
necessities of public welfare shows that it may have to be exercised in a 
summary way through executive officers. (Fong Yue Ting <em>vs</em>. United 
States, <em>supra</em>; United States <em>vs</em>. Ju Toy, 198 U. S., 253, 263; 
Moyer <em>vs</em>. Peabody, 212 U. S., 78, 84, 85.) So that the question is 
narrowed further to the inquiry whether the Philippine Government can not do 
what unquestionably Congress might.</p>
<p>"As Congress is not prevented by the Constitution, the Philippine Government 
can not be prevented by the Philippine Bill of Rights alone. (Act of July 1, 
1902, c. 1369, sec. 5; 32 Stat, 691, 692.) Deporting the plaintiffs was not 
depriving them of liberty without due process of law, unless on other grounds 
the local government was acting beyond its powers. But the local government has 
all civil and judicial power necessary to govern the Islands. (Act of March 2, 
1901, c. 803; 31 Stat, 895, 910; Act of July 1, 1902, c. 1369, sec. 1; 32 Stat., 
691.) The forms are diffrent, but as in Hawaii the proximate source of private 
rights is local, whether they spring by inheritance from Spain or are created by 
the Philippine Legislature. (See Kawananakos <em>vs</em>. Polyblank, 205 U. S., 
349, 354; Perez <em>vs</em>. Fernandez, 202 U. S., 80, 91, 92.) It would be 
strange if a Government so remote should be held bound to wait for the action of 
Congress in a matter that might touch its life unless dealt with at once and on 
the spot. On the contrary, we are of opinion that it had the power as an 
incident of the self-determination, however, limited, given to it by the United 
States.</p>
<p>"By section 86 of the Act of July 1, 1902, all laws passed by the Philippine 
Government are to be reported to Congress, which reserves power to annul them. 
It is worthy of mention that the law under consideration was reported to 
Congress and has not been annulled. The extension of the Chinese exclusion and 
immigration laws to the Philippine Islands has no bearing on the matter. The 
right to remain, for instance, under the Act of April 29, 1902, c. 641, section 
4; 32 Stat., 176, does not prevail over a removal as an act of state."</p>
<p>The argument for plaintiff in error in the Tiaco <em>vs</em>. Forbes case in 
the Supreme Court of the United States has been renewed on this occasion, and we 
here insert an extract, or summary of the contentions of counsel for the 
plaintiff in error in the former case, as found in the report of that case (228 
U. S., 551), because the disposition of these contentions in the above-cited 
opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States relieves us of the burden of 
extended discussion of many, ff not most, of the contentions of counsel for the 
petitioner in this case.</p>
<p>Counsel for the plaintiff in error in the former case contended fruitlessly 
that:</p>
<p>"The Government of the Philippine Islands has no power to deport aliens.</p>
<p>"The authorities cited on the existence of an inherent power to deport 
foreigners sustain the proposition only as to sovereign states in which that 
power is inherent as an essential element of sovereignty. That power does exist 
inherently in sovereign states.</p>
<p>"The Philippine Government, however, is not a sovereign community, at least 
in an international sense, but a mere dependency of the United States, limited 
to the exercise of such powers only as those with which it is vested by its 
organic act.</p>
<p>"Since the source of all power in the government of the Philippine Islands is 
the Congress of the United States, it must follow that if it has the power to 
expel aliens it must have been granted that power by Congress, either directly 
or by necessary implication.</p>
<p>"While Congress may assign to Federal officers, either in the United States 
or the Philippine Islands, the power to execute the provisions of such acts as 
Congress may pass regulating the exclusion or expulsion of foreigners from 
territory subject to the dominion of the United States, it is at least extremely 
doubtful whether it could delegate to the Philippine Government its sovereign 
power to exclude aliens. (Stoutenburgh <em>vs</em>. Hennick, 129 U. S., 141.) In 
any event this power could only be exercised subject to the limitation of the 
due-process clause of the Federal Constitution and the Philippine Bill of 
Rights.</p>
<p>"Congress has not delegated to the Philippine Government the power to exclude 
or expel foreigners.</p>
<p>"The power was not delegated by the President's instructions to the 
Commission of April 7,1900; the Executive Order of June 21, 1901; the Spooner 
Amendment; or the Organic Act of July 1, 1902. (See 26 Ops. Atty. Gen., [Dec. 
10, 1906], pp. 91, 96; Ops. Atty. Gen., pp. 534, 541.)</p>
<p>"Congress had already acted.</p>
<p>"Aside from the absence of authority to be found in the Organic Act of the 
Philippines conferring the right, Congress, both prior to and after the passage 
of the Organic Act, had legislated for the Philippines regarding the regulation 
of the admission and exclusion of foreigners. (See Act of April 29, 1902, making 
all the Chinese exclusion laws in force in the United States applicable to the 
Philippines ; also section 33 of the Immigration Act of March 3, 1903; section 
33 of the present Immigration Act in force; section 6 of the Act of February 6, 
1905.)</p>
<p>"The regulation of the admission or exclusion of all aliens into or from the 
Philippine Islands was a subject never entrusted to the Government or its 
officers (except to the extent of enforcing the immigration and exclusion laws 
of the United States applicable to the Philippines). (<em>In re</em> Allen, 2 
Phil. Rep., 630.)</p>
<p>"The regulation of the conditions under which foreigners may enter into and 
reside in the territory of the United States is incidental to the general and 
exclusive power vested in Congress to regulate commerce with foreign 
nations.</p>
<p>'The Governor-General has no such power.</p>
<p>'There being no power in the Philippine Legislature to legislate regarding 
the exclusion of foreigners from the Philippines in the first instance, their 
action could not constitute a ratification of what was done by the Governor- 
General.</p>
<p>"The deportation of the plaintiffs in error was without due process of 
law.</p>
<p>"The subject of the exclusion or expulsion of foreigners from any portion of 
the vast domains of the United States is one over which Congress has complete 
control.</p>
<p>"Congress would not concede to a dependent community powers inherent in the 
United States as a sovereign member of the family of nations, and powers which 
the various States of the Union have essayed in vain to exercise.</p>
<p>"The plaintiffs in error were entitled to maintain their residence in the 
Philippines under the Chinese Exclusion Laws and for these and other reasons 
their deportation was illegal and without due process of law."</p>
<p>It is urged, however, that since the date of the decision of the Supreme 
Court of the United States in the Tiaco <em>vs</em>. Forbes case (May 5, 1913) 
congressional legislation has deprived the Governor-General and the Philippine 
Legislature of authority to deport aliens except as therein provided, even when 
acting under their combined powers.</p>
<p>The Act of Congress approved August 29,1916 (popularly known as the Jones 
Law); and the Act of Congress which became law over the veto of the President, 
February 5, 1917 (The Immigration Law), are relied upon in support of this 
contention.</p>
<p>(A) But the Jones Law (Act of August 29, 1916) as expressly appears from its 
preamble was enacted "to provide a more autonomous Government" for the 
Philippine Islands, and the reasons assigned in the former case for the 
recognition of the power to deport aliens in the government of the Philippine 
Islands "as an incident of the self-determination, however limited, given to it 
by the United States," apply with even greater force under that statute than 
under the earlier organic Act (Act of March 2, 1901 and Act of July 1, 
1902.)</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Jones Law (section 6) expressly continued "in force and 
effect" all laws then "in force" in the Philippine Islands (except as altered, 
amended, or modified by its terms or by subsequent legislation), including 
section 83 of the Administrative Code of 1916 (which incorporated the provisions 
of <em>Act No, 2113</em>, and is identical with section 69 of the Administrative 
Code of 1917). Prior to the enactment of the Jones Law, this court, in an 
unanimous opinion in the Chan Yick Sam case, promulgated October 1, 1915 (31 
Phil. Rep., 560), had expressly construed the language used in Act No. 2113 and 
held, that under its provisions the Governor-General was authorized to institute 
and maintain deportation proceedings in the manner and form prescribed therein. 
It will be seen, therefore, that far from depriving the Governor-General and the 
Philippine Legislature of authority to deport aliens, the Jones Law expressly 
ratified and continued in force the statutory grant by the Philippine 
Legislature of authority to the Governor-General to deport aliens "upon 
investigation" conducted in the manner and form prescribed in these 
statutes.</p>
<p>Some question is now raised as to the correctness of the construction placed 
upon the provisions of the Philippine statute (Act No. 2113) in the Chan Yick 
Sam case (<em>supra</em>) and it is urged that, correctly construed, the 
language of this statute was not intended to confer authority, anfl should be 
held to furnish merely the procedure by which the action of the Governor-General 
must be regulated in the deportation of aliens.</p>
<p>We do not agree with these contentions, as will appear at greater length 
hereafter. But even if it were true that the court erred in its interpretation 
of the language of the statute in the Chan Yick Sam case (<em>supra</em>), we 
think that under well-settled rules of statutory construction, this statute, 
when incorporated into and "continued in force" as a part of the Administrative 
Code, after it had been construed by this court; and when ratified and again 
"continued in force" by the enactment by Congress of the Jones Law; must be held 
to have been thus "continued in force" by Congress and the Philippine 
Legislature with the meaning and effect placed upon it in the Chan Yick Sam 
decision (<em>supra</em>) ; that is to say, as a grant of regulated power to 
deport aliens after investigation conducted in the manner and form prescribed in 
the statute.</p>
<p>When the provisions of Act No. 2113 were enacted and "continued in force" by 
the enactment of the Administrative Code, and again "continued in force" by the 
enactment of the Jones Law the construction theretofore placed upon it by this 
court became an integral part of these statutes "having the force and effect of 
a legislative command."</p>
<p>Supported by numerous citations of authority the doctrine is set forth as 
follows by Sutherland in his work on Statutory Construction (vol. II, 2d. ed., 
sections 403 and 404):</p>
<p>"403. In the interpretation of reenacted statutes the court will follow the 
construction which they received when previously in force. The legislature will 
be presumed to know the effect which such statutes originally had, and by 
reenactment to intend that they should again have the same effect. The same rule 
applies to the readoption of a constitutional provision. It is not necessary 
that a statute should be reenacted in identical words in order that the rule may 
apply. It is sufficient if it is reenacted in substantially the same words. The 
same principle applies when a statutory provision is taken from a constitutional 
provision which has been construed. The rule has been held to apply to the 
reenactment of a statute which has received a practical construction on the part 
of those who are called upon to execute it. The Supreme Court of Nebraska says: 
'Where the legislature in framing an act resorts to language similar in its 
import to the language of other acts which have received a practical 
construction by the executive departments and by the legislature itself, it is 
fair to presume that the language was used in the later act with a view to the 
construction so given the earlier.' * * *</p>
<p>"404. When a statute is adopted from another state or county and such statute 
has previously been construed by the courts of such state or county, the statute 
is deemed, as a general rule, to have been adopted with the construction so 
given to it. The same rule applies to the adoption of a constitutional provision 
from another state. So when congress adopts a state statute for the District of 
Columbia. Where the foreign statute is mainly adopted, though not entirely and 
unchanged, the prior decisions of the foreign court are held to be entitled to 
great weight. Congress extended certain laws of Arkansas over the Indian 
Territory, and it was held that the construction previously placed upon them by 
the supreme court of Arkansas should be followed. * * * It is held that the 
general rule should not be departed from except for the strongest reasons."</p>
<p>(B) The contention that Congress, by the enactment of the Immigration Act of 
1917, and the extension of its provisions to the Philippine Islands, "occupied 
the field," and thereby deprived the Government of the Philippine Islands of 
power to deport aliens, except as provided in the Act itself, would seem to be 
substantially identical with the contention, adversely disposed of by the 
Supreme Court of the United States in the Tiaco <em>vs</em>. Forbes case, to the 
effect that "the subject of the exclusion or expulsion of foreigners from any 
portion of the vast domains of the United States is one over which Congress has 
complete control" and that "Congress, both prior to and after the passage of the 
Organic Act, had legislated for the Philippines regarding the regulation of the 
admission and exclusion of foreigners" by making the Chinese exclusion laws 
applicable to the Philippine Islands and by the enactment of the Immigration 
Acts of March 3, 1903, and of February 6, 1905.</p>
<p>In an attempt to distinguish the effect of the extention of the Immigration 
Act of 1917 to the Philippine Islands, from that given by the Supreme Cou.rt of 
the United States to the like extension of the Chinese exclusion laws and the 
Immigration Acts in force when the Tiaco <em>vs</em>. Forbes decision was 
rendered, it is contended that the express provisions in the Immigration Act of 
1917 for the regulation of the residence and the deportation of immigrants, 
under the terms of section 19 of the Act, is an implied negation of authority to 
the Government of the Philippine Islands to deport aliens for any other reason 
whatever. But it will be remembered that the Chinese exclusion laws, in force 
when the Tiaco vs. Forbes decision was rendered, also contained provisions for 
the regulation of the residence and the deportation of Chinese persons, and a 
like contention as to the rights of the plaintiff in error in that case, who was 
a Chinese person, to be exempt from deportation as an act of state, for any 
reason not specified in the Chinese exclusion laws and the Immigration Acts of 
1903 and 1905, was fruitlessly urged upon the Supreme Court of the United 
States.</p>
<p>As will be seen, in the citation from the opinion in the Tiaco <em>vs</em>. 
Forbes case (<em>supra</em>) the Supreme Court of the United States dealt with 
these contentions very summarily merely observing that "The extension of the 
Chinese exclusion and immigration laws to the Philippine Islands has no bearing 
on the matter. The right to remain, for instance, under the Act of April 29, 
1902 (c. 641, par. 4, 32 Stat., 176), does not prevail over a removal as an act 
of state." We think that a like disposition should be made of the contentions of 
counsel based on the provisions of the Immigration Act of 1917.</p>
<p>It is to be observed, furthermore, that the Immigration Act of 1917 expressly 
provides:</p>
<p>"That this Act shall be enforced in the Philippine Islands by the officers of 
the general government thereof, <em>unless and until it is superseded by an act 
passed by the Philippine Legislature and approved by the President of the United 
States</em> to regulate immigration in the Philippine Islands as authorized in 
the Act entitled 'An Act to declare the purpose of the people of the United 
States as to the future political status of the people of the Philippine 
Islands, and to provide a more autonomous government for those islands' approved 
August twenty-ninth, nineteen hundred and sixteen."</p>
<p>This Act became law on February 5, 1917.</p>
<p>The provisions of the Act approved August 29, 1916, (the Jones Law) referred 
to therein, is as follows:</p>
<p>"That while this Act provides that the Philippine Government shall have the 
authority to enact a tariff law the trade relations between the islands and the 
United States shall continue to be governed exclusively by laws of the Congress 
of the United States: <em>Provided</em>, That tariff acts or acts amendatory to 
the tariff of the Philippine Islands shall not become law until they shall 
receive the approval of the President of the United States, <em>nor shall any 
act of the Philippine Legislature affecting immigration or the currency or 
coinage laws of the Philippines become a law until it has been approved by the 
President of the United States: Provided further</em>, That the President shall 
approve or disapprove any act mentioned in the foregoing proviso within six 
months from and after its enactment and submission for his approval, and if not 
disapproved within such time it shall become a law the same as if it had been 
specifically approved." (Sec. 10, italics ours.)</p>
<p>Prior to the enactment of the Immigration Act, the Philippine Legislature had 
provided in the Administrative Code of 1916, as follows:</p>
<p>"A subject of a foreign power residing in the Philippine Islands shall not be 
deported, expelled or excluded from said Islands or repatriated to his own 
country by the Governor-General except upon prior investigation, conducted by 
said Executive or his authorized agent, of the ground upon which such action is 
contemplated. In such case the person concerned shall be informed of the charge 
or charges against him and he shall be allowed not less than three days for the 
preparation of his defense. He shall also have the right to be heard by himself 
or. counsel, to produce witnesses in his own behalf, and to cross-examine the 
opposing witnesses." (Sec. 83.)</p>
<p>This provision of the Code of 1916 was repealed and re-enacted in identical 
terms, as section 69 of the Administrative Code of 1917, by the Philippine 
Legislature on March 10, 1917, that is to say, subsequent to the date when the 
Immigration Act became law over the veto of the President.</p>
<p>The Administrative Code of 1917 was approved by the President on October 1, 
1917.</p>
<p>As we have just said, we are of opinion that the extension of the Immigration 
Act of 1917 to the Philippine Islands has no bearing on the question of the 
power of the Philippine Government to deport or expel aliens from these islands 
for other reasons than those mentioned in that Act; and that the right of the 
petitioner to remain under that Act "cannot prevail over his removal as an act 
of state" of the Philippine Government. But, assuming for the sake of argument, 
that we are in error in this regard, and that the provisions of section 83 of 
the Code of 1916 were abrogated or repealed, in whole or in part by the 
extention of the Immigration Act of 1917 to the Philippine Islands, we are 
satisfied that the Immigration Act itself must be held to have been 
<em>superseded</em> (under authority of the above cited provisions of the Act 
itself) to precisely the like extent, by the reenactment of the provisions of 
the former code, in identical terms, as section 69 of the Administrative Code of 
1917, with the approval of the President of the United States. If it be true 
that the provisions of section 83 of the Administrative Code of 1916 were 
"affected" by the enactment of the Act of Congress, it must also be true that 
the provisions of the Act of Congress were "affected" to a like extent by the 
enactment of section 69 of the Administrative Code of 1917 with the approval of 
the President of the United States. It follows that the authority which was 
conferred by the Legislature upon the Governor-General under the terms of 
section 83 of the Administrative Code 1916 was in like manner conferred upon him 
under the terms of section 69 of the Administrative Code of 1917, unaffected by 
the provisions of the Immigration Act from and after the day upon which that 
code received the approval of the President.</p>
<p>The specious suggestion that section 69 of the Administrative Code of 1917 
was intended to furnish, or that it should be held to furnish merely a set of 
regulations for the enforcement of the Immigration Act of that year (Act of 
Congress of February 5, 1917) is manifestly at variance with the legislative 
history of this statute, which is a reenactment in identical terms of section 83 
of the Administrative Code of 1916, the latter statute incorporating and 
continuing in force, with some slight amendments, the provisions of Act No. 2113 
approved February 1, 1912.</p>
<p>The last contention made as to the lack of power in the Governor-General 
which need be noticed may be stated as follows:</p>
<p>Conceding that at the time when the Tiaco vs. Forbes decision was rendered by 
the Supreme Court of the United States, the Philippine Government had power to 
deport aliens as an act of state; and conceding that neither the Jones Law (Act 
of August 29, 1916), nor the Immigration Act of 1917, have had the effect of 
depriving the Philippine Government of that power, so that it continues in 
existence to this day; nevertheless, this case is to be distinguished from the 
Tiaco <em>vs</em>. Forbes case, in that the Act of the Philippine Legislature 
(No. 1986) enacted April 19, 1910, approving, ratifying and affirming the action 
of the Governor-General in the former case, was equivalent to an express 
authorization of the former deportation by the legislature whereas, as it is 
claimed, there is no act of the Philippine Legislature authorizing the 
Governor-General to order the deportation in the instant case. It is urged that 
neither section 69 of the Administrative Code of 1917, nor section 83 of the 
Administrative Code of 1916, nor Act No. 2113 of the Philippine Legislature 
conferred or purported to confer any such authority upon the Governor-General of 
the Philippine Islands.</p>
<p>It will readily be seen that this contention calls upon us for a construction 
of the meaning and effect of our local statutes, unaffected by any question as 
to the relation of these statutes to congressional legislation or the provisions 
of the Constitution of the United States.</p>
<p>We are of opinion that by the enactment of the series of statutes just cited, 
the Philippine Legislature conferred upon the Governor-General authority to 
deport subjects of foreign powers, as an act of state, "upon prior 
investigation," conducted in the manner indicated in section 69 of the 
Administrative Code of 1917.</p>
<p>As we have already indicated, this court was called upon, in the case of Chan 
Yick Sam <em>vs</em>. Prosecuting Attorney of Manila, decided October 1, 1915 
(31 Phil. Rep., 560), to consider the meaning and effect of the provisions of 
Act No. 2113, enacted February 1, 1912, and it was there held that this Act 
furnished full and lawful authority to the Governor-General to proceed to deport 
a foreigner.</p>
<p>The syllabus of that decision, prepared by the writer of the opinion, is as 
follows:</p>
<p>"<em>Held</em>: Under the facts stated in the opinion, that the prosecuting 
attorney of the city of Manila, in compliance with an order of the 
Governor-General, has, in accordance with Act No. 2113, the authority to examine 
witnesses concerning certain charges against aliens who are suspected of 
inciting the perpetration of certain acts against the safety, welfare, and peace 
of the Chinese community in the city of Manila and of being persons subject to 
deportation. (Forbes <em>vs</em>. Chuoco Tiaco and Crossfield, 16 Phil. Rep., 
534; 228 U.S., 549.)"</p>
<p>In that case, which arose after the Tiaco <em>vs</em>. Forbes case had been 
decided by the Supreme Court of the United States, this court sustained a ruling 
of the Court of First Instance of Manila denying a writ of prohibition against 
the maintenance of deportation proceedings instituted under and by authority of 
Act No. 2113, and held that the act conferred the necessary authority upon the 
Governor-General and his authorized agents to institute and maintain such 
deportation proceedings.</p>
<p>It should be a sufficient answer to the contentions of counsel as to the 
absence of legislative authority to deport the petitioner, to refer to our 
ruling in the case just cited; but Act No. 2113 having been superseded and 
incorporated in slightly amended form in the Administrative Codes, and the 
argument in favor of the grant of power having been strongly reenforced thereby, 
it may not be amiss to reconsider the whole question as raised in the instant 
case. To this end it will be well to review the whole course of local 
legislation on this subject considered in relation to the decisions of the 
courts with reference thereto.</p>
<p>Act No. 1986 of the Philippine Legislature, enacted April 19, 1910, is as 
follows:</p>
<p>"AN ACT CONFIRMING THE ACTION OF THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL IN DEPORTING FROM THE 
PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, BY REQUEST OF THE IMPERIAL CHINESE CONSUL-GENERAL, ON AUGUST 
NINETEENTH, NINETEEN HUNDRED AND NINE, CERTAIN PERSONS OF CHINESE 
NATIONALITY.</p>
<p>"Whereas the Governor-General has recently, at the request of the 
representative of the Chinese Government, and in the exercise of authority 
vested in him by law, authorized the deportation from the Philippine Islands of 
twelve alien Chinese, subjects of the Emperor of China, after careful 
investigation, and upon being convinced, by the result of said investigation, 
that the presence of the said individuals in the Philippine Islands might result 
in serious harm to the Chinese colony and constitute a serious danger to the 
public tranquility and welfare; and</p>
<p>"Whereas, the Governor-General has sent a message to the Legislature, setting 
forth the facts in regard to the matter, therefore,</p>
<p><em>"By authority of the United States, be it enacted by the Philippine 
Legislature, that:</em></p>
<p>"Section 1. The action of the Governor-General in deporting from the 
Philippine Islands, at the request of the Imperial Chinese Consul-General, on or 
about the nineteenth day of August, nineteen hundred and nine, the twelve 
persons of the Chinese race and subjects of the Emperor of China, is hereby 
approved, ratified, confirmed, and in all respects declared legal, and not 
subject to question or review.</p>
<p>"Sec. 2. The public good requiring the speedy enactment of this bill, the 
same shall take effect on its pasage, in accordance with section one of Act 
Numbered Nineteen hundred and forty-five of the Philippine Legislature, entitled 
'An Act providing the time at which all Acts of the Philippine Legislature shall 
take effect.' "</p>
<p>This statute was enacted a few weeks after civil actions for damages had been 
instituted by some of the Chinese deportees against the Governor-General and the 
police officers who executed his deportation order. Its evident purpose was to 
cure any defect which might be found to exist in the authority of the 
Governor-General in the premises; and although it expressly recited in its 
preamble that he had ordered the deportation "in the exercise of authority 
vested in him by law," it is very clear that it was felt that the contentions of 
his counsel as to the legality of the deportation order would be strengthened by 
an express ratification of the order, which, as was later declared by the 
Supreme Court of the United States, had the effect of an express grant of power 
by the Legislature.</p>
<p>From the message of the Governor-General and the published reports of the 
legislative and judicial proceedings incident to the deportation of Chuoco 
Tiaco, it appears that sharp differences of opinion arose at that time as to the 
power of the Philippine Government to deport aliens; that grave doubts existed 
in the minds of many of the members of the legislature as to whether the 
Governor-General could exercise the power by virtue of his office alone, without 
legislative sanction or authority; and that conflicting views were entertained 
by some of the members of the legislative bodies and the then Chief Executive as 
to whether the Legislature had authority to limit, restrict, or regulate the 
exercise of this power.</p>
<p>Two years later, evidently as the outcome of the discussion of the Chuoco 
Tiaco deportation proceedings, the geneneral subject of deportation and 
repatriation of foreigners was dealt with by the Philippine Legislature in Act 
No. 2113, enacted February 1, 1912, which is as follows:</p>
<p>"AN ACT REGULATING THE AUTHORITY OF THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL OF THE PHILIPPINE 
ISLANDS TO DEPORT, EXCLUDE, EXPEL, OR REPATRIATE FOREIGNERS.</p>
<p>"Whereas it has been decided that the Governor-General of the Philippine 
Islands has authority to deport, expel, exclude, or repatriate foreigners, by 
due process of law;</p>
<p>"Whereas there is no law at present in the Philippine Islands which 
determines or defines such, process of law;</p>
<p>"Whereas it is necessary and advisable for the individual security of all 
residents of these Islands clearly to fix said process of Law: Now, 
therefore,</p>
<p><em>"By authority of the United States, be it enacted by the Philippine 
Legislature, that:</em></p>
<p>"Section 1. Hereafter the Governor-General of the Philippine Islands may not 
deport, expel, exclude, or repatriate from said Islands any foreigners residing 
therein without prior investigation made by said Executive or his authorized 
agents, in which the person or persons whose deportation, expulsion, exclusion, 
or repatriation is contemplated, and their counsel and witnesses shall be given 
a hearing. Such persons shall be informed of any charges which there may be 
against them, and shall be granted a period of time not less than three days to 
prepare their defense and shall be given an opportunity to cross-examine the 
witnesses for the prosecution: <em>Provided</em>, That this Act shall not be 
construed as authorizing the <em>extrañamiento</em>, destierro, deportation, or 
any other form of expulsion from the Islands of Filipinos.</p>
<p>"Sec. 2. All Acts and legal provisions legally incompatible herewith are 
hereby repealed.</p>
<p>"SEC. 3. The public good requiring the speedy enactment of this bill, the 
same shall take effect on its passage in accordance with section one of Act 
Numbered Nineteen hundred and forty-five of the Philippine Legislature."</p>
<p>A year later the Supreme Court of the United States in the Tiaco <em>vs</em>. 
Forbes case, decided May 5, 1913, set all doubts at rest as to the power of the 
Philippine Government to deport aliens as an act of state; and, reserving 
opinion as to whether the Governor-General could exercise the power "by virtue 
of his office alone," made it clear that the Philippine Legislature and the 
Governor-General, acting "under their combined powers," had authority to deport 
aliens as an act of state; and that "the very ground of the power in the 
necessities of public welfare shows that it may have to be exercised in a 
summary way through executive officers."</p>
<p>Less than six months after the promulgation of the decision in the Tiaco vs. 
Forbes case, this court, citing and relying upon that decision, held in the Chan 
Yick Sam case (31 Phil. Rep., 560), that the Governor-General had authority 
under the above cited Act No. 2113, to institute and maintain deportation 
proceedings against a foreigner in accord with its provisions.</p>
<p>On February 24, 1916, the Philippine Legislature enacted the Administrative 
Code of that year, and on March 10, 1917, it enacted the Administrative Code now 
in force, substantially incorporating therein the provisions of the former code, 
with such amendments and additions as were deemed necessary and expedient, as 
the result of the enactment of the Jones Law (Act of August 29, 1916), providing 
for a more autonomous government for the Philippine Islands.</p>
<p>Section 83 of the Code of 1916, and 69 of the Code of 1917 are identical, and 
incorporate into those codes the provisions of Act No. 2113, with the omission 
of the title and preamble and some slight changes in the body of the Act.</p>
<p>Section 69 of the Code of 1917 is a subdivision of article II, chapter IV, 
title II, which treats of "Particular powers and duties of the 
Governor-General," itself a subdivision of Book I which treats of the 
"Organization, powers, and general administration of the Philippine 
Government."</p>
<p>This section is as follows:</p>
<p><em>"Deportation of subject of foreign power</em>.—A subject of a foreign 
power residing in the Philippine Islands shall not be deported, expelled, or 
excluded from said Islands or repatriated to his own country by the 
Governor-General except upon prior investigation, conducted by said Executive or 
his authorized agent, of the ground upon which such action is contemplated. In 
such case the person concerned shall be informed of the charge or charges 
against him and he shall be allowed not less than three days for the preparation 
of his defense. He shall also have the right to be heard by himself or counsel, 
to produce witnesses in his own behalf, and to cross-examine the opposing 
witnesses."</p>
<p>Section 3 of the Code of 1917 provides as follows:</p>
<p><em>"Relation of Administrative Code to prior laws</em>.—Such provisions of 
this Code as incorporate prior laws shall be deemed to be made in continuation 
thereof and to be in the nature of amendments thereto, without prejudice to any 
right already accrued."</p>
<p>We think that the authority of the Governor-General to deport, expel, exclude 
or repatriate subjects of foreign powers residing in the Philippine Islands, as 
an act of state, upon prior investigation, is clearly derivable from the express 
terms of this statute, having in mind its context and relative position in the 
Code; its antecedents; the whole course of local legislation with relation to 
the matter of deportation of aliens; and the acquiescence of the legislator in 
the construction placed upon Act No. 2113 by this court in the Chan Yick Sam 
case (<em>supra</em>) and in the assumption by the Chief Executive of authority 
thereunder, of both of which he had notice when again and yet again he 
incorporated the provisions of Act No. 2113 in the Administrative Codes.</p>
<p>It is urged that, read by itself, section 69 of the Code of 1917, like its 
predecessors, Act No. 2113 and section 83 of the Code of 1916, which it 
continues in force with some amendments, is a purely adjective or procedural 
statute; that it contains no express grant of authority; and that it purports 
merely to regulate the exercise by the Governor-General of authority to deport, 
as an act of state.</p>
<p>We are of opinion, however, that while it is doubtless true that the second 
paragraph of this section relates wholly. to procedure, the first paragraph not 
merely regulates and controls the power of the Governor-General, but, certainly. 
by plain implication, and as we think in express terms, confers authority in 
deportation proceedings, when they are had upon prior investigation, and 
conducted in the manner and form prescribed in this section.</p>
<p>The somewhat unusual phrasing of the language of Act No. 2113 quite clearly 
reflects the doubts and uncertainties then existing as to the source, the 
ultimate depositary, and even the existence of power in the Philippine 
Government to deport aliens as an act of state. But it is not of vital 
importance whether the members of the Legislature were, or were not, correctly 
advised as to their power in the premises, or the source from which it is 
derived. The real question is whether legislative intent to concede the power to 
the Governor-General and to assert merely their own power to regulate its 
exercise, finds expression in the language of the statute. We entertain no doubt 
that if not expressly, then by plain implication, the Governor-General was 
authorized under the terms of the first paragraph [section] of the statute to 
deport aliens, upon investigation conducted in the manner prescribed 
therein.</p>
<p>That the legislator himself understood that this paragraph contained a grant 
of authority, express or implied, is quite clearly indicated by the 
<em>proviso</em>, which expressly declares that "this Act shall not be construed 
as <em>authorizing</em>" the deportation or expulsion from the Islands of 
Filipinos: evidently intended to foreclose the possibility that the word 
<em>foreigners</em>, used in a statute enacted in the English language under 
American sovereignty might be construed to include Filipinos.</p>
<p>It is true that this statute purported to be an act regulating the authority 
of the Governor-General to deport foreigners, and that the preamble sets forth 
that "it had been decided" that the Governor-General had authority to deport 
aliens by due process of law. But it will be seen that in exercising the right 
tacitly assumed by the legislator in the other paragraphs of the preamble, to 
"determine," "define," and "fix" such process of law, he clearly and explicity 
specified in the body of the act itself the instances in which he consented to 
the exercise of such authority as well as those in which he forbade its 
exercise.</p>
<p>The cautious phrasing of the paragraph of the preamble which declared that 
"it has been decided that the Governor- General has authority to deport 
foreigners by due process of law" discloses that the lawmakers desired to 
reserve their own views on that subject; and we think that a critical 
examination of the whole statute clearly discloses the intention of the 
lawmakers to assert the right to regulate so as to forbid arbitrary deportations 
and at the same time to concede the right to deport foreigners upon prior 
investigation, coupled, however, with an express declaration of the legislative 
will to prohibit the deportation of Filipinos on any pretext whatever.</p>
<p>That which is plainly implied in the language of a statute is as much a part 
of it as that which is expressed. (Sutherland on Statutory Construction, 2d. 
ed., p. 9236.)</p>
<p>If, however, the peculiar phrasing of Act No. 2113 with its preamble, left 
any real ground for uncertainty as to the intention of the legislator to concede 
a regulated power to deport aliens, no such doubt arises as to the legislative 
intent in the enactment of the provisions touching the deportation of aliens in 
the administrative codes.</p>
<p>Omitting the title and the preamble, the provisions of Act No. 2113, with 
some slight but significant amendments were included among the provisions of 
these carefully prepared administrative codes defining and delimiting the 
jurisdiction and distribution of powers of government, and they are to be found 
in the chapters of those codes which set forth "the particular powers and duties 
of the Governor-General."</p>
<p>Prior to the enactment of these codes the Supreme Court of the United States 
had dealt with the subject in the Tiaco <em>vs</em>. Forbes case, and this court 
had construed Act No. 2113 in the Chan Yick Sam case. These decisions and the 
lapse of time had clarified the atmosphere; and the Legislature when it again 
undertook to deal with the subject of deportation of foreigners, as an act of 
state, under the section title of "Deportation of subject of foreign power," 
instead of directing its prohibition against the Governor-General himself, as in 
the old statute wherein it provided that the "Governor-General may not deport 
foreigners except, etc.", directed its prohibition against deportations of 
subjects of a foreign power by the Governor-General except upon prior 
investigation, etc. The modification in the language is slight but significant, 
because it suggests, first that the legislator felt and knew that he was dealing 
with an established practice, sanctioned by the courts; and, second, that in the 
code provisions the legislator was not merely regulating and controlling the 
practice, but consciously defining and delimiting the occasions upon which the 
power to deport might, and upon which it might not be exercised by the 
Governor-General with legislative authority.</p>
<p>The substitution of the words "subjects of a foreign power" in the code in 
place of the word "foreigner" in Act No. 2113, was intended, of course, to 
render unnecessary the proviso in the Act expressly denying a grant of authority 
to deport Filipinos, by the use of descriptive words in the grant of authority 
which could not be construed, under any possible circumstances or in any 
language, to include natives of the Islands.</p>
<p>Examined with relation to the context, and the express purpose and object of 
the codification of the laws defining and delimiting the powers of Government in 
the Philippine Islands, we are of opinion that the ordinary and usual 
interpretation which should be placed upon the language of section 69 of the 
Administrative Code of 1917, and the application thereto of the ordinary rules 
of grammatical construction, must be held to sustain the contention of the 
Attorney-General that it was intended to confer and that it does in fact confer 
a regulated authority upon the Governor-General in the matter of deportation of 
aliens.</p>
<p>Finally, we think that the acquiescense of the legislator in the 
interpretation placed upon the statute by the courts, and in the assumption of 
authority thereunder by the Governor-General, operated in itself as a grant of 
such power. The Philippine Legislature had notice prior to the enactment of Act 
No. 1986 in the year 1910, that the Governor-General had asserted and exercised 
the power to deport aliens as an act of state. Both the Legislature, and the 
special tyoard of experienced lawyers and judges who prepared the Administrative 
Codes of 1916 and 1917, must be presumed to have had notice that 
<em>thereafter</em>, the Governor-General again asserted the right to exercise 
that ppwer under and by virtue of the authority contained in the provisions of 
Act No. 2113 approved February 1, 1912. The proceedings in one such case are set 
out at length in the reports of our decision in the case of Chan Yick Sam, 
promulgated October 1, 1915, and reported in the weekly Official Gazette<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and in 31 Phil. Rep., 560. In that case, 
as we have seen, this court expressly recognized and unanimously sustained the 
authority of the Governor-General to maintain these proceedings under and by 
virtue of the statute (Act No. 2113). And yet, upon two separate occasions 
thereafter, the provisions of that statute were reenacted with some slight 
amendments which in no wise affected the expression of the legislative will 
touching the exercise of the power to deport aliens by the Chief Executive.</p>
<p>We think that if there ever was any ground for doubt as to the legislative 
intent to concede authority to the Governor-General by the enactment of Act No. 
2113, it was swept away by the reenactment of its provisions in the 
administrative codes under the circumstances just indicated; and that the 
Philippine Legislature must be held to have acquiesced in, and consented to the 
continuance of the practice long ere this. (Cf. Citations from Sutherland on 
Statutory Construction [<em>supra</em>].)</p>
<p>In the case of U. S. <em>vs</em>. Midwest Oil Company (35 Sup. Ct. Rep., 309) 
:</p>
<p>"The power of the President to make certain land reservations was questioned. 
It appeared that the President or the Executive Department of the Government 
claimed the authority to make such reservations without any statutory grant. It 
also appeared that Congress had notice of this claim of authority and did not 
repudiate it; the Supreme Court of the United States held that 'Its silence was 
acquiescence. Its acquiescence was equivalent to consent to continue the 
practice until the power was revoked by some subsequent action by Congress.' 
"</p>
<p>In our consideration of the case thus far, we have rested our conclusions 
strictly on the doctrine of the decision of the Supreme Court of the United 
States in the Tiaco <em>vs</em>. Forbes case as we understand it, because in 
this case as in that case, we believe that the concession or grant of authority 
to the Governor-General by the Philippine Legislature validates the deportation 
of the petitioner, as an act done under their combined powers, whether or not 
power to deport aliens is vested in the Governor-General "by virtue of his 
office alone." It would seem that we might stop here, but in view of the marked 
divergence of opinion which has developed in the discussion of this case as to 
whether the language of the local statutes sustains a ruling that the Philippine 
Legislature has, in fact, conferred authority upon the Governor-General in the 
premises, it may be proper to indicate that we think that an examination of the 
history of the office of the Chief Executive in these Islands under American 
sovereignty will disclose that, until and unless he is <em>deprived</em> of such 
authority by some act of Congress or of the Philippine Legislature, the power of 
the Philippine Government to deport aliens as an act of state is vested in the 
Governor-General by virtue of his office, subject only to the regulations 
prescribed in section 69 of the Administrative Code of 1917, or by future 
legislation on the subject.</p>
<p>We incline to the belief that authority to control, limit, restrict, and 
perhaps even to prohibit the exercise by the Governor-General of this power, by 
appropriate legislation, was conferred upon the Philippine Legislature, the 
elected representatives of the people of the Islands, under the terms of the 
Jones Law (Act of August 29, 1916), providing a more autonomous form of 
government for the people of the Philippine Islands. We think, furthermore, that 
the enactment of that statute furnishes a sufficient grant of authority to the 
Philippine Legislature to provide for the exercise of the power of the 
Philippine Government to deport aliens through such instrumentalities, and under 
such appropriate regulations, as it may deem proper to prescribe; and to ratify, 
confirm, or concede authority for the exercise of such power in the Chief 
Executive. Indeed, that body has heretofore exercise legislative power to confer 
jurisdiction upon the courts to order the deportation of aliens upon a second 
conviction of a violation of the Opium Law. We are disposed also to think that 
such power was vested in the Philippine Legislature prior to the enactment of 
the Jones Law. But we are well satisfied, also, that under American sovereignty, 
<em>the essentially civil power to deport aliens as an act of state</em> was 
originally vested in the first Civil Governor by virtue of the presidential 
orders hereinafter cited, affirmed and ratified by the Congress of the United 
States; and that it has continued in the office of the Chief Executive, the 
Governor-General, ever since, except in so far as his power has been restricted, 
limited or controlled by the various acts of the Philippine Legislature to which 
reference has already been made.</p>
<p>We find nothing in the history of the legislative relations of the Philippine 
Islands and the United States which would indicate that the power, which 
undoubtedly was vested in the first Civil Governor, has been withdrawn from any 
of his successors. Doubtless the power to legislate upon the subject was 
conferred upon the Philippine Legislature under the Jones Law; but there is 
nothing in that act to indicate the intention of Congress by its enactment and 
without further legislation, local or congressional, to abrogate the regulated 
system then in force for the exercise of the power to deport aliens as an act of 
state, and to deprive the Governor-General of the power vested in him prior to 
its enactment.</p>
<p>Our rulings on the other branch of the case necessitating the denial of the 
petitioner's prayer for discharge under the writ, and our time being extremely 
limited, we may not pursue the inquiry further. We must therefore content 
ourselves with a reference to the President's Instructions to the Commission of 
April 7, 1900; the Executive Order of the President of June 21, 1901; the 
Spooner Amendment of the Act of Congress of March 2, 1901; section 1 of the Act 
of Congress of July 1, 1902; the Act of Congress of August 29, 1916, and U. S. 
<em>vs</em>. Bull, 15 Phil. Rep., 7.</p>
<p>The Spooner Amendment found in the Act of Congress of March 2, 1901, is as 
follows:</p>
<p>"All military, civil and judicial powers necessary to govern the Philippine 
Islands, acquired from Spain by the treaties concluded at Paris on the tenth day 
of December, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, and at Washington on the seventh 
day of November, nineteen hundred, shall, until otherwise provided by Congress, 
be vested in such person or persons, and shall be exercised in such manner as 
the President of the United States shall direct, for the establishment of civil 
government and for maintaining and protecting the inhabitants of said Islands in 
the free enjoyment of their liberty, property, and religion." (31 Stat. at L., 
910.)</p>
<p>The order of the President of June 21, 1901, appointing a Civil Governor is 
as follows:</p>
<p>"On and after the 4th day of July, 1901, until it shall be otherwise ordered, 
the President of the Philippine Commission will exercise the executive authority 
in all civil affairs in the government of the Philippine Islands heretofore 
exercised in such affairs by the Military Governor of the Philippines, and to 
that end the Hon. William H. Taft, President of said Commission, is hereby 
appointed Civil Governor of the Philippine Islands. Such executive authority 
will be exercised under, and in conformity to, the instructions to the 
Philippine Commissioners, dated April 7, 1900, and subject to the approval and 
control of the Secretary of War of the United States."</p>
<p>Section 1 of the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902 (Philippine Bill) is, in 
part, as follows:</p>
<p><em>"Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled</em>, That the action of the President 
of the United States in creating the Philippine Commission and authorizing said 
Commission to exercise the powers of government to the extent and in the manner 
and form and subject to the regulation and control set forth in the instructions 
of the President to the Philippine Commission, dated April seventh, nineteen 
hundred, and in creating the offices of Civil Governor and Vice-Civil Governor 
of the Philippine Islands, and authorizing the said Civil Governor to exercise 
the powers of the Government to the extent and in the manner and form set forth 
in the executive order dated June twenty-first, nineteen hundred and one, * * * 
is hereby approved, ratified, and confirmed, and until otherwise provided by law 
the said Islands shall continue to be governed as thereby and herein provided, * 
* *."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, one objection to the theory that power to deport aliens is 
vested in the Governor-General by virtue of his office alone, under the terms of 
the above cited congressional legislation; and that the Chief Executive of the 
Philippine Islands may lawfully exercise that power, subject to regulation by 
Congress or the Philippine Legislature, until and unless he is <em>deprived</em> 
of authority by Act of Congress or the Philippine Legislature, deserves some 
attention. It has been suggested that the power to deport aliens as an act of 
state, which was undoubtedly included among the powers which the Military 
Governor was authorized to exercise after the occupation of the Islands by the 
armed forces of the United States, should not be held to have vested in the 
first Civil Governor and his successors in office by virtue of the executive 
orders of the President, the Spooner Amendment and the various acts of Congress 
organizing the Philippine Government, because it would be unreasonable to 
suppose that it was the intention of Congress to provide for the transfer of 
purely military powers to a civil executive; and because in no event would 
powers which had their origin wholly in military necessity survive the complete 
disappearance of the military situation creating the necessity. But these 
contentions are manifestly based on the erroneous premise that the power to 
deport aliens as an act of state which was exercised by the commander-in-chief 
of the military forces in occupied territory, was necessarily a purely military 
power similar in kind and origin to the power, for example, which he exercised 
to deport natives of the Islands or citizens of the United States.</p>
<p>We readily agree that it would be unreasonable to suppose that the power to 
deport any person whatever, whether a citizen of the United States or not, whose 
presence appeared to constitute an obstacle in the path of the military forces 
of the United States in the Philippines, was transmitted from the Military 
Governor to the Civil Governor and his successors in office through a period of 
nearly two decades of profound peace. But the power to deport aliens is not 
derived exclusively or necessarily from military necessity. Indeed, its exercise 
is in many, if not in most instances, a function of the civil and political 
department of the Government, properly vested in the civil authorities in time 
of war as in time of peace, unless taken over by the military commander by the 
assumption of civil as well as military powers in territory under his command. 
(Cf. Moore's International Law Digest, vol. IV, sec. 550 <em>et seq</em>.)</p>
<p>In the case of Fok Yo <em>vs</em>. U. S. ([1902], 185 U. S., 296) the Supreme 
Court of the United States said:</p>
<p>"The doctrine is firmly established that the power to exclude or expel aliens 
is vested in the political department of the government, to be regulated by 
treaty or by Act of Congress and to be executed by the executive authority 
according to such regulations, * * *."</p>
<p>We are of opinion that in the Philippine Islands the doctrine which should be 
established is that the power to exclude or expel aliens is vested in the 
political department of the government, to be regulated by treaty, or Act of 
Congress of the United States, or by Act of the Philippine Legislature; and, 
under the laws as they now stand on the statute books, to be executed by the 
Governor-General, the supreme executive authority, according to such 
regulations.</p>
<p>Although somewhat out of its logical order, we think we should add here some 
comment on an objection to our rulings to which our attention was more 
especially directed, upon reading one of the dissenting opinions after the 
foregoing had been completed. It is urged that not only was Congress lacking in 
power, under the Constitution, to delegate undefined authority to deport aliens 
to the Philippine Government, but also that the Philippine Legislature was 
lacking in constitutional authority to delegate such undefined authority to the 
Chief Executive of the Philippine Islands.</p>
<p>These contentions would seem to be sufficiently disposed of by directing 
attention to the fact that the Supreme Court of the United States has held, in 
the case of Tiaco <em>vs</em>. Forbes (<em>supra</em>), not only that Congress 
has the power so to do, but that it did in fact delegate full power to the 
Philippine Government to deport aliens as an act of state; and, further, that 
when the Governor-General does in fact deport an alien, by authority of an Act 
of the Philippine Legislature, the deportation may properly be treated as an act 
of state, done under "the combined powers" of the Philippine Legislature and the 
Governor-General.</p>
<p>It will be well, nevertheless, to examine this contention at greater length, 
on principle as well as on authority.</p>
<p>As is well said in a decision (Yick Wo <em>vs</em>. Hopkins, 118 U. S., 356) 
cited in one of the dissenting opinions in this case, "It is, indeed, quite 
true, that there must always be lodged somewhere, and in some person or body, 
the authority of final decision."</p>
<p>But despite this manifest truism, it is insistently contended that it is 
unconstitutional and contrary to the basic principles of American sovereignty in 
these Islands to lodge in the hands of the Governor-General power to deport 
aliens, unless the instances in which such power may be exercised are 
specifically designated and defined. It is said that it is a useless and vain 
formality to require that "the alien shall be heard before he is expelled, if 
the expulsion may take place regardless of what he may say," and that "the mere 
formality of a hearing is not in itself sufficient to constitute due process of 
law."</p>
<p>As we understand these contentions, it is urged that even if it were admitted 
that Congress or the Philippine Legislature may lawfully delegate power to 
deport aliens to the Chief Executive in certain specified and enumerated 
instances, neither Congress nor the Philippine Legislature may lawfully delegate 
power, generally, in all the instances in which they themselves may exercise 
such power. But what are the instances in which such power may be delegated, and 
in what instances is it unconstitutional to delegate the power to deport? If 
power to deport may be delegated in some instances, where is the constitutional 
or legal prohibition upon the delegation of the power in all instances?</p>
<p>The truth is, of course, that the instances in which aliens may be deported 
as an act of state must be determined upon recognized principles of 
international law; and that the Legislature, when it conferred a regulated power 
on the Governor-General to deport aliens, upon prior investigation, in all 
instances in which the Government of the Phillippines may deport aliens as an 
act of state, did not confer an arbitrary power to deport any alien upon "a mere 
whim" as is suggested, but only such aliens as may properly and lawfully be 
deported under recognized rules of international law.</p>
<p>While it is impossible to enumerate the cases wherein aliens may properly and 
lawfully be deported under recognized rules of international law, it is not 
impossible to lay down "a rule of law defining the standard of conduct for the 
violation of which the right of asylum which aliens enjoy under our laws is to 
be forfeited/1 Indeed few rules of law are more firmly established both in 
international law and in American municipal law than that every alien forfeits 
his right of asylum in the country in which he resides, in the absence of treaty 
provisions to the contrary, when his conduct or his mode of life renders his 
presence there inimical to the public interests. As was said by a standard 
authority on International Law "Some writers have essayed to enumerate the 
legitimate causes of expulsion. The effort is useless. The reasons may be summed 
.up and condensed in a single word: <em>The public interest of the State</em>. 
Bluntschli wished to deny to states the right of expulsion but he was obliged to 
acknowledge that aliens might be expelled by a simple administrative measure." 
(Bonfils, Manual du Droit Int. Public, sec. 442; Moore's International Law 
Digest, Vol. IV, p. 68.)</p>
<p>It will be seen then, that when the Congress of the United States and the 
Philippine Legislature conferred power on the Governor-General to deport aliens 
upon prior investigation, they did not confer arbitrary power to deport aliens 
at his mere whim; his authority being limited to cases wherein, after due 
investigation, the conduct or mode of life of the persons whose deportation is 
contemplated is found i&amp; be inimical to the public interests. It needs no 
argument nor citation of authorities to show that it was within the power of 
Congress and the Philippine Legislature to confer jurisdiction upon the 
Governor-General to adjudicate the facts upon which such deportations must be 
predicated; and to make his judgments in such cases as final and as conclusive 
as if like jurisdiction had been conferred upon the ordinary courts of law.</p>
<p>Let it be noted that we are not discussing, at this time, the political 
wisdom of conferring such powers on the Chief Executive. It is not within the 
province of the courts to pass upon the wisdom or unwisdom of legislative 
enactments. The question is not whether Congress and the Philippine Legislature 
should have delegated authority of this kind, but whether such authority could 
be delegated under the laws and the Constitution of the United States. No 
reason, other than those of mere political expediency, have been suggested for 
denying the power of the Legislature to confer such authority; and yet as was 
said by the Supreme Court of the United States in the Tiaco <em>vs</em>. Forbes 
case (<em>supra</em>) "The very ground of the power in the necessities of the 
public welfare shows that it may have to be exercised in a summary way through 
executive officers."</p>
<p>Moreover, we are dealing in the present case with a specific instance of the 
exercise of the power to deport, wherein the ground upon which the deportation 
is contemplated is that the petitioner is "an undesirable alien, whose continued 
presence in the Islands is a menace to the peace and safety of the community," 
as appears from the deportation order itself, and the charges upon which the 
investigation was held.</p>
<p>If the petitioner is in fact what he has been adjudged to be after a fair and 
impartial hearing, no one can doubt, under present conditions, that this is a 
proper instance for the exercise by the Governor-General of the delegated 
authority to deport aliens as an act of state; and even if the grant of power 
should be held to be ineffective as an unrestricted and unlimited delegation of 
power to deport aliens, it must be held to be a sufficient delegation of a 
regulated power to deport aliens upon grounds such as those upon which the 
deportation of the petitioner are based.</p>
<p>In eloquent and impassioned periods counsel for the petitioner urge us to 
order his discharge from detention, and thus "conserve the sacred traditions of 
personal liberty maintained by the founders of the American Republic and their 
English ancestors;" and we are told that to sustain the regulated power of the 
Governor-General to deport aliens from the Philippine Islands as an act of 
state, is to challenge the principles and authority of Magna Charta, the 
Constitution of the United States, the Philippine Bill of Rights, and to set 
ourselves against all the historic precedents established by the Anglo-Saxon 
race through centuries of toil, and blood, and oppression.</p>
<p>But in answer to all this we need only say in addition to what has been said 
already:</p>
<p>1. That the Supreme Court of the United States was not deterred by such 
considerations from upholding the power of the Governor-General in the Tiaco 
<em>vs</em>. Forbes case (<em>supra</em>) a few years ago, when it said that the 
summary deportation of the plaintiffs in that case did not deprive them of 
liberty "without due process of law;" and that "As Congress is not prevented 
(<em>from deporting aliens</em>) by the Constitution, the Philippine Government 
cannot be prevented by the Philippine Bill of Rights alone."</p>
<p>2. That the founders of the American Republic, themselves, saw nothing in the 
Constitution to deter them from placing the Alien and Sedition Laws upon the 
statute books, when the need therefor arose a few years after that great 
instrument was adopted (1798). It will be remembered that it was the members of 
the Federalist party, many of whom had taken a leading part in the 
constitutional convention, who were responsible for the enactment of the statute 
which empowered the President to deport all aliens whom he should judge 
dangerous to the peace and safety of the community. And though, as a result of 
popular agitation, this statute was not reenacted after it had expired under its 
own terms, that fact furnishes no ground for argument either for or against its 
constitutionality. The statute never was judicially tested, and we have no 
authoritative judicial pronouncement as to its constitutionality.</p>
<p>3. That the great English judges do not find in Magna Charta nor elsewhere in 
the British Constitution anything which forbids the deportation of aliens by 
executive authority in the colonies of the Empire, even in the great self- 
governing colonies such as Canada. "Eminent English judges, sitting in the 
Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, have gone very far in supporting the 
exclusion or <em>expulsion, by the executive authority of a colony of 
aliens</em> having no absolute right to enter its territory or to remain 
therein." (<em>In re</em> Adam, 1 Moore, P. C, 460, quoted in Fong Yue Ting 
<em>vs</em>. United States, 149 U. S., 698, 709.) "The Crown has power to 
exclude an alien and may delegate that power to Canada." (Atty. Gen. 
<em>vs</em>. Cain, A, C, 542, reversing Re Gilhula, 10 Ont. L. Rep., 469.)</p>
<p>From what has been said it is clear that the prayer of the petitioner for 
discharge under the writ should be denied.</p>
<p>Let the appropriate order be entered, three days after the filing of this 
opinion, remanding the petitoner to the custody of the chief of police of the 
city of Manila, with the costs of the proceedings against the petitioner; and 
ten days thereafter let the record be filed with the archives of original 
proceedings in this court.</p>

<p align="center"><em><strong>DISSENTING OPINION </strong></em></p>
<p><strong>JOHNSON J.</strong>, <em>dissenting:</em> </p>
<p>This is an original petition filed in the Supreme Court for the writ of 
habeas corpus. The petitioner alleges that he is unlawfully restrained of his 
liberty by Anton Hohmann, Acting Chief of Police of the city of Manila; that 
said unlawful restraint and detention is by virtue of an order issued by the 
Governor-General of the Philippine Islands, which is in the following words:</p>
<p><em>"To the Chief of Police, City of Manila, or to any Peace 
officer.</em></p>
<p>"Greeting: Whereas, after an investigation duly conducted in accordance with 
the provisions of section 69 of the Administrative Code (Act No. 2711), it 
appears that R. McCulloch Dick is a subject of a foreign power, residing in the 
Philippine Islands;</p>
<p>"Whereas it further appears that said R. McCulloch Dick is an undesirable 
alien, whose presence in the Philippine Islands is a menace to the peace and 
safety of the community;</p>
<p>"Now, therefore, by virtue of the powers in me vested, you are hereby 
authorized and ordered to deport said R. McCulloch Dick to the neighboring 
colony of Hongkong, and thereafter to exclude him from these Islands.</p>
<p>"In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the 
Government of the Philippine Islands to be affixed.</p>
<p>"Done at the city of Manila this 18th day of March, in the year of our Lord 
nineteen hundred and eighteen.</p>
<p align="right">(Sgd.) "Francis Burton Harrison,<br>"[seal.] 
<em>Governor-General</em>."</p>
<p>that the Governor-General has no authority to issue said order of 
deportation; that said order is in violation of the Constitution, treaties, and 
laws of the United States, and of the Laws of Nations in force in the Philippine 
Islands; that he is not restrained of his liberty nor is he in custody of an 
officer under process issued by a court or magistrate or by a judgment or order 
of a court of record.</p>
<p align="center">FACTS.</p>
<p>The facts antecedent to the issuance of said order of deportation, as they 
appear from the record—the petition, the return, the order to appear before the 
commissioner appointed to make the investigation, and the stenographic notes of 
the evidence which were taken during said examination, as certified to by the 
stenographer, all having been admitted as true and correct copies of the entire 
proceedings by all the parties—may be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(<em>a</em>) That the petitioner, being the editor and proprietor of the Free 
Press, a periodical published weekly in the city of Manila, published the 
following statement, which appears in Vol. 12, No. 7, of the issue of February 
16, 1918:</p>
<p align="center">"KNOW HOW TO FORAGE.</p>
<p>"If the man of the Philippine National Guard can fight like they can steal, 
then the Kaiser and his legions had better beat it before the boys from the 
Philippines are sent over there. The details of the first case which appeared in 
the papers have slipped us now. It was not long thereafter, however, till there 
was recorded the Manila Hotel case, where the turkeys kept disappearing. When 
the watch was set during the night and the thief caught * * * National Guard. 
Then there was the case of a candidate for a commission as officer of the Guard. 
Took off his coat, he did, to be measured for the physical test. When he came to 
put it on again, lo! * * * his watch was gone. Again a guardsman. The latest 
testimonial to the guards' ability to get away with things come from the 
Carnival. When the cakes mysteriously disappeared from the Tea Cup Inn on the 
last night of the big festival, it was to the tent of the sentries that the 
telltale tracks led, and there were found the crumbs of the midnight feast. 
Again the Guard. In one of Shakespeare's plays there is mention of three soldier 
rogues in buckram. The guard is not in buckram, but apparently it has its 
rogues."</p>
<p>(<em>b</em>) That on the 23d day of February, 1918, Col. D. P. Quinlan was 
appointed as the agent of the Governor-General for the purpose of investigating 
certain charges which had been preferred against the petitioner. Said 
appointment is as follows:</p>
<p align="right">"February 23, 1918.</p>
<p>"Colonel D. P. Quinlan,<br><em>"Philippine National Guard, Manila.</em></p>
<p>"Sir: Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section sixty-nine of Act No. 
2711, known as the Administrative Code of 1917, you are hereby designated as the 
agent of the Governor-General for the purpose of investigating and reporting 
upon charges which have been preferred against R. McCulloch Dick, the editor and 
proprietor of the Philippines Free Press, a periodical published weekly in the 
city of Manila, in connection with the publication of certain articles in that 
paper which tend to obstruct the government of the Philippine Islands in 
policies inaugurated for the prosecution of the war between the United States 
and the German Empire, and other articles which have tended to create a feeling 
of unrest and uneasiness in the community. It is desired that you submit your 
report of this investigation to the Governor-General at the earliest possible 
date.</p>
<p align="right">"Very respectfully,<br>(Sgd.) "Francis Burton 
Harrison,<br><em>"Governor General."</em></p>
<p>(<em>c</em>) That in pursuance of and in compliance with said appointment the 
petitioner was notified, a hearing was had at the beginning of which Colonel 
Quinlan notified the petitioner of the charges against him (see record), 
witnesses were examined, and report made by said agent and the order of 
deportation above noted was issued, and the petitioner was subsequently taken 
into custody for the purpose of carrying the same into effect.</p>
<p>(<em>d</em>) That the petitioner arrived in the United States from England in 
the year 1901 or 1902, attended American institutions of learning, took the oath 
of intention to become a citizen of the United States in 1903, and about the 
same time came to the Philippine Islands and has since then been engaged in 
newspaper work as editor and proprietor; that he continued to be engaged in 
newspaper work up to and including the time when the present proceedings were 
instituted.</p>
<p>The present action was instituted for the purpose of testing the legality of 
said order of deportation;</p>
<p>Speaking, in most general terms, the petition, the return made to the order 
to show why the writ prayed for should not be granted, and the record, present 
but two questions:</p>
<p>1. Is the Governor-General, of the Philippine Islands, vested with the power 
and authority under the law, as the Government of the Philippine Islands is now 
organized under the Jones Law, to deport subjects of a foreign power? And,</p>
<p>2. Granting that such power exists, was the petitioner given the hearing 
required by law?</p>
<p>There is nothing in the record nor in the argument in support of the petition 
which shows in the slightest degree that the order of deportation was not made 
in the utmost good faith, fully believing that full and complete power existed 
for the action taken in detaining the petitioner. There is nothing in the record 
which even tends to show, or which even intimates, that the action taken was not 
done with the utmost good faith. It is believed that no one is more deeply 
interested in maintaining and adequately protecting all of the liberties of the 
inhabitants of the Philippine Islands than the present Chief Executive. He has 
demonstrated his high sense of the liberties of the people in word and action. 
His precepts have been exemplified by his official action. He is in a large 
measure responsible for the now autonomous government which exists in the 
Philippine Islands today, and the Filipino people will revere and honor his 
name, forever. But good intentions, honest motives, and high ideals are not 
sufficient to justify the exercise of a power which does not exist.</p>
<p align="center">RIGHT OF THE COURT TO INQUIRE INTO LEGALITY OF ORDER OF 
DEPORTATION.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the hearing in this court upon the petition and return, 
there was a suggestion made that the court was without authority or jurisdiction 
to inquire into the legality of the order of deportation in question. Granting 
that the power to deport aliens exists under the law and that it was exercised 
in accordance therewith and that there was no abuse of such authority, then and 
in that case the courts are without power or authority or jurisdiction to 
change, alter, revoke, or modify, in any way whatsoever, the said order of 
deportation issued by the Governor-General. Upon the, other hand, if such power 
does not exist under the law or if it was not exercised in accordance with the 
provisions of law, then and in that case it is the legal and sworn duty of the 
courts to inquire into the legality of the same by the method and by the 
procedure invoked by the petitioner. (Section 77, G. 0. No. 58 (April 29 1900); 
section 530, Act No. 190 (October 1,1901) ; section 5, Act of Congress of July 
1, 1902; section 3, Act of Congress of August 29, 1916 [Jones Law].)</p>
<p>Paragraph 1 of section 3 of the Jones Law, among other things, provides that 
no <em>person</em> shall be deprived of his liberty without due process of law. 
That inhibition and protection which the inhabitants of the Philippine Islands 
enjoy involves two separate and distinct ideas:</p>
<p>1. There must be a <em>law</em> authorizing the detention and restraint of 
persons of their liberties;</p>
<p>2. That the detention must be exercised in accordance with a procedure which 
affords the person an opportunity: (<em>a</em>) to be informed of the charges 
preferred against him; (<em>b</em>) to be confronted with the witness against 
him; (<em>c</em>) to be present at the hearing; (<em>d</em>) to present proof in 
his defense; (<em>e</em>) to be represented by an attorney, if he so desires; 
(<em>f</em>) to his liberty during the actual trial; (<em>g</em>) to 
cross-examine the witnesses; and (<em>h</em>) to bail, except in certain cases, 
during the pendency of the action or proceedings.</p>
<p>While the courts hesitate, and rightfully so, to inquire into the legality of 
the acts of the executive department of the government, yet they are <em>without 
discretion</em> in the premises in cases where it is alleged that a person is 
being illegally deprived of his liberty by that department. The law makes no 
distinction with reference to the person or persons who are responsible for 
illegal and unlawful detentions. The mere fact that such alleged illegal 
deprivation of liberty, is caused by the Chief Executive, in the face of the 
mandatory provisions of the law, is no sufficient excuse or justification for a 
refusal on the part of the courts to take jurisdiction for the purpose of 
inquiring into such alleged illegal detention. Under the system of checks and 
balances, by virtue of the existence of the different departments of the 
Government, in the Government of the United States and the Territories subject 
4to its control, it becomes the legal and bounden duty of the courts to inquire 
into the legality, when called upon so to do, of the acts of other departments 
of the Government and to make pronouncements thereon. (U. S. <em>vs</em>. Ten 
Yu, 24 Phil. Rep., 1, 10; Case <em>vs</em>. Board of Health and Heiser, 24 Phil. 
Rep., 250, 276; U. S. <em>vs</em>. Joson, 26 Phil. Rep., 1, 65; U. S. 
<em>vs</em>. Gomez Jesus, 31 Phil. Rep., 219.)</p>
<p>For <em>every</em> person who is illegally deprived of his liberty the law 
affords a remedy by the ancient and historic writ of habeas corpus. The Jones 
Law expressly provides (paragraph 7, section 3) that "the privilege of the writ 
of habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless when in case of rebellion, 
insurrection, or invasion, the public safety may require it," and that no person 
shall be deprived of his liberty or life or property without due process of law. 
(Barcelon <em>vs</em>. Baker and Doe Thompson, 5 Phil. Rep., 87; Moyer 
<em>vs</em>. Peabody, 212 U. S., 78; 148 Fed. Rep., 870; <em>In re</em> Moyer, 
35 Colo., 217; 12 L. R. A. [N. S.], 1002; <em>Ex parte</em> Milligan, 4 Wall. 
[U. S.], 2.</p>
<p>No contention is made that the writ has been suspended. The terms of this 
quoted provision of the Jones Law necessarily imply judicial inquiry and 
judicial action. (<em>Ex parte</em> Yerger, 75 U. S., 85.)</p>
<p>In England all the higher courts were vested with jurisdiction to grant the 
writ of habeas corpus. It was considered as the only adequate remedy by which 
persons could be protected in their individual rights. The remedy was early 
conceded to the colonists of the North American Continent. One of the very first 
acts adopted by the Congress of the United States, under the Constitution, was 
to invest the courts with full and ample power to grant the writ of habeas 
corpus. (I Stat. at L., 81.)</p>
<p>The remedy by habeas corpus was granted and enforced in the Philippine 
Islands by the Military Government. (G. O. No. 58.) President McKinley was not 
unmindful of the inviolable rights of the inhabitants of the Philippine Islands 
for the reason that when giving his Instructions to the United States 
Commission, he ordered, that <em>no person</em> shall be deprived of life, 
liberty or property without due process of law. The United States Commission, in 
obedience to that command, in one of the earliest acts adopted by it, provided 
that in order to test the legality of any deprivation of liberty, the courts 
were given jurisdiction to grant the writ of habeas corpus. (Sees. 17 and 56, 
Act No. 136.) Not only did the law confer upon the courts jurisdiction to issue 
the writ of habeas corpus, but expressly <em>ordered</em> them to exercise the 
same whenever it was made to appear that the writ ought to issue. (Sec. 530, Act 
No. 190; sec. 80, G, O. No. 58.)</p>
<p>Section 77 of General Orders No. 58 provides that <em>every person</em> 
unlawfully restrained of his liberty <em>under any pretension whatever</em>, may 
prosecute a writ of habeas corpus, in order that the <em>courts may inquire into 
the cause of such restraint.</em> The writ of habeas corpus has been denominated 
the palladium of the political rights of man. (Blackstone's Commentaries.) It is 
the means by which <em>judicial inquiry</em> is made into the alleged 
encroachments upon the political and natural rights of individuals. It has for 
centuries, been used to protect the individual against the illegal encroachments 
upon his rights by whatever department of the Government. (<em>Ex parte</em> 
Milligan, 4 Wall., 2; <em>Ex parte</em> Stacy, 10 Johnson [N. Y.], 333.)</p>
<p>"It is the <em>indispensable duty</em> of this court, and one to which every 
inferior consideration must be sacrified," says Chief Justice Kent, "to act as a 
faithful guardian of the personal liberty of the citizen and to give ready and 
effectual aid to the means provided by law for its security. * * * Nor can we 
hesitate in promptly enforcing a due return, to the writ, when we recollect 
that, in this country, the <em>law knows no superiors</em>." (<em>Ex parte</em> 
Stacy, <em>supra</em>.)</p>
<p>The provision of the Jones Law, that no person shall be deprived of his 
liberty <em>without due process of law</em>, means that no person shall be 
imprisoned or restrained except under some provision of the <em>law</em> of the 
land. The words "law of the land" and "due process of law" are employed 
interchangeably in Constitutional Law and means the same thing. (State 
<em>vs</em>. Simons. 2 Spears, 761; Parsons <em>vs</em>. Russel, 11 Mich., 
129.)</p>
<p>It has been said that when the Government provided that no person shall be 
deprived of his liberty <em>without due process of law</em>, "it means that 
every person shall hold his life, liberty, property, and immunities under the 
protection of general rules of law." (Dartmouth College <em>vs</em>. Woodward, 4 
Wheat. [U. S.], 578.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court of the United States has in numerous cases held that it 
will intervene, and pronounce illegal and void <em>any act of any official</em> 
of <em>any department of the</em> government <em>when by such act any 
person</em> has been deprived of his liberty without due process of law. Such 
authority is exercised without reference to whether the person so deprived of 
his liberty is a citizen, denizen or alien. Of course, we are not here 
discussing war powers. They are not involved here. There is a clear distinction 
between pronouncing the acts of an official illegal and void and holding him 
liable in damages when he has acted in good faith and especially when the act 
complained of was ar act <em>in state</em>. (Musgrave <em>vs</em>. Chun Teeong 
Toy, L. R. A. C. [1891], 272; <em>In re </em>Adams, 1 Moore's Privy Council, 
460.)</p>
<p>If an act of the legislative or executive department of the Government is to 
be held illegal upon judicial inquiry, because it deprives persons of their 
liberties, it is not because the courts have any control over the legislative or 
executive power, but because the act itself is forbidden by the fundamental law 
of the land, and because the will of the people, as declared in such fundamental 
law, is paramount over all of the departments of the government and must be 
obeyed by all public officials as well as private individuals. <em>In 
pronouncing a statute</em>, or a <em>particular act</em> of any individual or 
official in any department of the Government <em>illegal</em>, the 
<em>courts</em> are simply interpreting the meaning, force and application of 
the fundamental law of the State. (Case <em>vs</em>. Board of Health and Heiser, 
24 Phil. Rep., 250.) <em>We are of the opinion that the court has full and ample 
power and jurisdiction to make the inquiry invoked by the petitioner.</em></p>
<p align="center">FORMER DECISION.</p>
<p>With reference to the first question above suggested, it was argued by the 
respondent that the same had been answered in the affirmative by this court in 
the decision of the case of Forbes vs. Chuoco Tiaco and Crossfield (16 Phil. 
Rep., 534). In that case Forbes, acting in his capacity as Governor-General of 
the Philippine Islands, deported the plaintiff. Later he returned to the 
Philippine Islands and instituted a civil action against Forbes for damages. 
This court decided that Forbes, as Governor-General, was not liable in damages. 
An appeal was taken to the Supreme Court of the United States and there that 
decision was, by a unanimous opinion, confirmed. (Tiaco <em>vs</em>. Forbes, 228 
U. S. 549.)</p>
<p>In the case of Forbes <em>vs</em>. Chuoco Tiaco and Crossfield certain 
reasons were given in support of the contention that the Governor-General, 
<em>"acting in state,"</em> under his powers <em>then</em> existing, had full 
and complete authority to deport <em>aliens</em> whom, he believed or had good 
reason for believing, were a "menace to the good order, peace, and tranquility 
of the State," and was, therefore, not liable in damages for the due exercise of 
that authority; that his act of deportation was <em>"an act of state,"</em> and 
was fully justified and supported by the powers then vested in him as the 
Government was then organized and constituted. The arguments adduced by a 
divided court in support of that conclusion were based upon three principal 
grounds:</p>
<p>1. That the Military Government, which immediately preceded the then Civil 
Government, acting under the war power, possessed and freely and frequently 
exercised the power to deport not only <em>aliens</em>, but <em>citizens</em> of 
the Philippine Islands;</p>
<p>2. That "<em>all</em> military, civil, and judicial power" theretofore held 
and exercised by the Military Government had been transferred and turned over, 
without limitation or specification, to the Civil Government as then 
constituted; and,</p>
<p>3. That even though said power did not exist, for said first and second 
reasons, his exercise of the same had been expressly ratified and fully 
confirmed by the legislative department of the Government by a resolution of the 
19th day of April, 1910, and that his acts having been fully ratified he was not 
liable in damages. (Forbes <em>vs</em>. Chuoco Tiaco and Crossfield, 16 Phil. 
Rep. 534, 571; Resolution of the Philippine Legislature, April 19, 1910; United 
States <em>vs</em>. Heinszen &amp; Co., 206 U. S., 370; O'Reilly de Camara 
<em>vs</em>. Brooks, Major General, 209 U. S., 45; Tiaco <em>vs</em>. Forbes, 
228 U. S., 549; Act of the Philippine Legislature, No. 2113.)</p>
<p>That case (Forbes <em>vs</em>. Chuoco Tiaco and Crossfield, 16 Phil. Rep. 
534) was appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States and there confirmed 
(Tiaco vs. Forbes, 228 U. S., 549). The Supreme Court of the United States 
evidently did not regard the first and second reasons given above as sufficient 
to justify the conclusion reached by this court, for the reason that it based 
its decision and confirmation upon the third ground above mentioned, and 
decided, in effect, that the act of Governor Forbes, in deporting said aliens, 
having been ratified by a statute of the Philippine Legislature, and having been 
done under and by virtue of the <em>combined powers of the executive and 
legislative departments of the government</em>, and thereby having acted in 
state, he was not liable in damages. (Tiaco <em>vs</em>. Forbes, 228 U. S., 549, 
556.) Whatever may have been the former opinion the members of this court with 
reference to the sufficiency of the first and second reasons, they must now be 
held to be insufficient and therefore be denied. That court "having the right 
and the final authority to review the decisions of this court in cases like the 
present, we must submit to and be governed by the doctrine and jurisprudence 
which it announces. An amendment of the law may be such as to entirely change 
and abrogate a long line of established jurisprudence. For example, in the case 
of Pollock <em>vs</em>. Farmers' etc., Co., the Supreme Court of the United 
States decided that an Act, providing for an income tax, was unconstitutional. 
(157 U. S., 429; 158 U. S., 601.) In 1913, by virtue of a change of the Organic 
Law, a similar act was held to be perfectly valid. Many other cases might be 
given to show how jurisprudence has been revoked and modified by subsequent 
legislation. (See Molina <em>vs</em>. Rafferty, p. 167, <em>post</em>.)</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, we think the conclusion must be inevitable, that, 
even as the Civil Government was then organized, the Governor-General as such 
did not possess in himself alone the power or authority to deport aliens without 
authority expressly granted or ratified, either by the Legislature of the 
Philippine Islands or by an Act of the Congress of the United States; <em>that 
if the power did exist then it was by virtue of the combined powers of the 
executive and legislative departments</em> of the Government. The Philippine 
Legislature was evidently of the same opinion or otherwise the ratification of 
April 19, 1910 (Acts Nos. 1986 and 2113) would not have been expressly given. 
Legal acts or acts done with authority need no ratification. Ratification is 
only necessary to cure some power or authority not existing at the time it was 
exercised.</p>
<p align="center">RIGHT OF SOVEREIGN GOVERNMENT TO DEPORT ALIEN.</p>
<p>It is a doctrine so well established now that it scarcely needs citation of 
authorities in its support that "the right of a nation to expel or deport 
foreigners who have not been naturalized or taken any steps toward becoming 
citizens of the country, rests upon the same ground and is as absolute and 
unqualified as the right to prohibit and prevent their entrance into the 
country. The power to exclude or expel aliens being a power affecting 
international relations, is vested in the political department of the 
Government. The power to exclude aliens and the power to expel them rest upon 
one foundation, are derived from one source, are supported by the same reasons, 
and are, in truth, by the exercise of one and the same national or sovereign 
power. Such power is an incident of every independent nation or sovereign. It is 
a part of its independence, for if it could not exclude aliens it would be, to 
that extent, subject to the control of other powers. The power of exclusion of 
foreigners, being an incident of sovereignty or nationality belonging to the 
Government of the United States as a part of its sovereign powers delegated by 
the Constitution, the right to its exercise at any time when, in the judgment of 
the political department of the Government, the interests of the country require 
it, cannot be granted away or restrained on behalf of anyone. Such sovereign or 
national powers cannot be abandoned or surrendered nor can their exercise be 
hampered when needed for the public, by any consideration of private interests. 
It is an ancient maxim of international law that every sovereign nation has the 
power, as inherent in sovereignty, and essential to preservation, to forbid the 
entrance of foreigners within its dominions or to admit them only in such cases 
and upon such conditions as <em>it</em> may see fit to prescribe either by law 
or by treaty. (Ekiu <em>vs</em>. U. S., 142 U. S., 651; Fong Yue Ting 
<em>vs</em>. U. S., 149 U. S., 698; Forbes <em>vs</em>. Chuoco Tiaco and 
Crossfield, 16 Phil. Rep., 534; 13 Law Quarterly Review, 165.)</p>
<p>A foreigner may be objectionable as a citizen not only because of his 
criminal antecedents, but also because of his physical or mental condition, or 
because his development as a civilized being is below that of the mass of the 
population of which he proposes to become a member, and for those reasons and 
many others, entirely within the breast of the sovereign, aliens may be excluded 
as well as expelled. All continental governments have exercised the right of 
excluding and expelling aliens for purposes of state, and have exercised such 
powers freely when they considered it necessary so to do. And it has been held 
in numerous cases that an alien so excluded or expelled has no right of action 
against the sovereign which expels or excludes him or an official of such 
government who acts in obedience to commands of his government in the 
performance of an act in state. (Burong <em>vs</em>. Venman, 2 Exchequer, 167; 
Musgrove <em>vs</em>. Chun Teeong Toy, [1891] Appeal cases, 272.)</p>
<p>NECESSITY OF LAW OR AUTHORITY TO JUSTIFY THE EXERCISE OF POWER TO DEPORT IN 
THE UNITED STATES AND ITS DEPENDENCIES AND WHERE LODGE.</p>
<p>It being a well-established doctrine, and not now denied by any of the 
civilized nations of the world, that every sovereignty possesses the inherent 
power to regulate, by law, the admission into and exclusion from his country of 
aliens, as well as to regulate the manner, their residence while permitted to 
remain within his territory, it becomes necessary then to discover just where 
such inherent power in the sovereignty is located by law. The question, what 
entity, person or department of the sovereignty may exercise that power, is a 
more difficult one. In absolute monarchies, all the sovereign powers are vested 
in the monarch. In limited monarchies the sovereign powers are divided. In 
democracies and republics the sovereign powers are generally vested in the 
people and remain there until they have delegated them by law to certain 
specified officials or departments of the government. In England such powers 
were formerly exercised by the king without the consent of Parliament. But in 
later times such powers were regulated by Parliament and were delegated to such 
persons or departments as were specifically authorized by acts of Parliament. 
(Musgrove <em>vs</em>. Chun Teeong Toy <em>supra</em>; 1 Blackstone's 
Commentaries, 260; Chitty, Prerogatives of the Crown, 49; 2 Coke's Inst, 
57.)</p>
<p>In the United States, from the time of its organization, this power has been 
vested in the political department of the Federal Government composed of the 
executive and legislative departments. (The Chinese Exclusion Case, 130 U. S., 
581; Ekiu <em>vs</em>. United States, 142 U. S., 651; Fong Yue Ting <em>vs</em>. 
United States, 149 U. S., 698; Wong Wing <em>vs</em>. United States, 163 U. S., 
228; 2 Corpus Juris, 1075; 1 R. C. L., sees. 41, 42; Bugajewitz <em>vs</em>. 
Adams, 228 U. S., 585.)</p>
<p>In the United States the power to exclude or expel aliens may be exercised in 
the political department of the Government (a) by the President and Senate in 
their combined treaty-making power, or, (b) through statutes enacted by 
Congress. (United States <em>vs</em>. Ju Toy, 198 U. S., 253; United States 
<em>vs</em>. Williams, 194 U. S., 279; Japanese Immigrant Case, 189 U. S., 86; 
Pearson <em>vs</em>. Williams, 202 U. S., 281; Zakonaite <em>vs</em>. Wolf, 226 
U. S., 272; 2. Corpus Juris, 1075.)</p>
<p>Justice Gray, speaking for the court; in the case of Ekiu <em>vs</em>. United 
States, said: "In the United States this power is vested in the <em>National 
Government</em>, to which the Constitution has committed the entire control of 
international relations, in peace as well as in war. It belongs to the political 
department of the Government, and may be exercised either through treaties made 
by the President and Senate, or through statutes enacted by Congress, upon whom 
the constitution has conferred power to regulate commerce with foreign nations." 
(Head Money Cases, 112 U. S., 580; The Chinese Exclusion Case, 130 U. S., 
581.)</p>
<p>The Constitution of the United States speaks with no uncertain sound upon 
this subject. That instrument, established by the people of the United States as 
the fundamental law of the land, has conferred, upon the President, the 
executive power; has authorized him, by and with the consent of the Senate, to 
make treaties and has made it his duty to take care that the laws be faithfully 
executed. The Constitution has granted to Congress the sole power to regulate 
commerce with foreign nations including the importation of goods and the 
bringing of aliens into the ports of the United States and to make all laws 
necessary and proper for carrying into execution these powers and all other 
powers vested by the Constitution in the Government of the United States or in 
any department or officer thereof. The power to exclude and to expel aliens in 
the United States is vested in the political department of the Government 
<em>and the exercise of such power</em> is regulated by a treaty or by Act of 
Congress and is executed by the executive authority according to such 
regulations. (Fong Yue Ting <em>vs</em>. United States, 149 U. S., 698.)</p>
<p align="center">RIGHT OF STATES, TERRITORIES AND DEPENDENCIES TO EXERCISE POWER 
OP DEPORTATION.</p>
<p>While the different States of the Union are regarded as sovereign in certain 
spheres of action, they have been denied the right to exclude or expel aliens as 
such and for that reason. (<em>In re</em> Ah Fong, 3 Sawy., 144; State 
<em>vs</em>. The S. S. Constitution, 42 Cal., 578; 7 Cyc, 419.)</p>
<p>In the case of <em>In re</em> Ah Fong, <em>supra</em>, the court said: 
"Whatever outside of the legitimate exercise of this right affects the 
intercourse of foreigners with our people, their immigration to this country and 
residence therein, is exclusively within the jurisdiction of the General 
(Federal) Government and is not subject to state control or interference."</p>
<p>Considering then that the Federal Government has reserved to itself, as 
against the states thereof, the exclusive right to regulate the question of the 
right of aliens to enter and exclude them, and that such right is denied to the 
State, can we conclude that the Territories of the United States are possessed 
of this power? Territories and dependencies of the United States are mere agents 
of the Federal Government, organized under special acts of Congress (charters) 
with certain specific, general and limited powers. Their powers, like those of 
every other agent, whatever they may be, must be found in the charter, expressed 
or by necessary implication from such expressed powers. Even the provisions of 
the Constitution of the United States are not applicable to the Territories and 
dependencies of the United States, unless they are expressly made so. (Downes 
<em>vs</em>. Bidwell, 182 U. S., 244, 267.) The territories and dependencies of 
the United States are governed by virtue of special or general laws made 
applicable thereto. They are not organized under the Constitution, nor subject 
to its complex distribution of the powers of government, as the Organic Law. 
They are the creations, exclusively, of the legislative department of the 
Government, and subject to its supervision and control. (Benner <em>vs</em>. 
Porter, 9 How. [U. S.], 235; Clinton <em>vs</em>. Englebrecht, 13 Wall. [U. S.], 
434; Good <em>vs</em>. Martin, 95 U. S., 90; McAllister <em>vs</em>. United 
States, 141, U. S., 174; Downes <em>vs</em>. Bidwell, 182 U. S., 244, 267; 
McCulloch <em>vs</em>. Maryland, 4 Wheat., 316; Rommey Church <em>vs</em>. 
United States, 136 U. S., 3.)</p>
<p>The power of Congress over the Territories of the United States is general 
and plenary, arising from and incidental to the right to acquire the territory 
itself, and from the power given by the Constitution to make all needful rules 
and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the 
United States. (Downes <em>vs</em>. Bidwell, <em>supra</em>.)</p>
<p>From the foregoing, we are of the opinion that it must follow, that the 
Territories and dependencies of the United States, the same as the States of the 
Union, are not authorized, <em>in the absence of express authority</em>, to 
legislate upon the question of the immigration of aliens.</p>
<p>RIGHT OF GOVERNMENT OF PHILIPPINE ISLANDS TO DEPORT ALIENS. HAS AUTHORITY 
BEEN GIVEN AND HAS IT BEEN EXERCISED?</p>
<p>With that conclusion it becomes necessary to inquire next whether Congress, 
in the exercise of its exclusive authority to legislate for the territories and 
dependencies, has by any legislation conferred upon the Government of the 
Philippine Islands authority, on its own account, to admit or expel aliens? If 
such authority has been given, upon whom and upon what department of the 
government has the exercise of the same been imposed?</p>
<p>With reference to the laws providing for the deportation of persons from the 
Philippine Islands, an examination of the laws in force shows, at least, several 
which provide for the exclusion and expulsion of aliens. The <em>first</em> is 
the immigration laws (The Chinese Exclusion Laws) of the United States, which 
are made applicable to the Philippine Islands. These laws provide for the 
exclusion of Chinese persons, persons suffering from some loathsome diseases, 
and other persons who are expressly mentioned by classes. That law is enforced 
by the Department of Customs and the Bureau of Health, and those departments are 
given <em>final</em> jurisdiction, subject to certain restrictions. The 
<em>second</em> is the contract labor law which is also enforced by the 
Department of Customs with certain limitations. (<em>In re</em> Allen, 2 Phil. 
Rep., 630.) The <em>third</em> is Act No. 702 adopted by virtue of authority of 
Congress, expressly authorizing and requiring the Philippine Government to 
register all Chinese laborers and to deport those who refuse so to do after a 
certain period. The deportation, under that law, when it is made, is done after 
hearing duly had by the courts. The <em>fourth</em> is Act No. 2381 which 
permits the courts to deport certain aliens under express conditions therein 
given. The deportation provided for in that Act is in the nature of a punishment 
for the violation of the Opium Law. It is notable that none of these laws 
authorize the Governor-General to deport any of the classes of persons 
mentioned. There is no contention made here that the petitioner is a Chinaman, a 
laborer or that he has violated the Opium Law. The <em>fifth</em> is the Act of 
Congress of February 5, 1917 (vol. 39 Stat. at L., 874), known as an Act "to 
regulate the immigration of aliens to, and the residence of aliens in, the 
United States." That Act is made applicable to the Philippine Islands, and will 
be enforced by the "officers of the General Government thereof." Said Act 
provides that certain classes of aliens may be excluded and expelled. No 
contention is made that the petitioner belongs to any of the classes mentioned. 
The <em>sixth</em> is section 69 of Act No. 2711. That section provides simply a 
procedure for the deportation of "subjects of a foreign power." It is contended, 
from the mere fact that a procedure has been adopted by which the powers may be 
exercised, that the right to deport may be inferred. A further discussion of 
section 69 will be taken up again in this opinion.</p>
<p>The petitioner contends that even though it be conceded that the power to 
deport aliens by the Governor-General existed at the time Governor-General 
Forbes exercised it, it does not exist now. He asserts that the powers of the 
Government of the Philippine Islands as they existed prior to the Jones Law are 
very different from the powers existing after the passage of that law. He 
contends that, even though the power to deport aliens existed in the Governor- 
General or (and) the Philippine Legislature prior to the Jones Law, under the 
general powers then possessed, such power no longer exists, for the reason: 
(<em>a</em>) That the powers and duties of the Governor-General are no longer 
general or indefinite but are now limited and specifically defined, and that the 
power to deport aliens is not among such powers; (<em>b</em>) that, while 
perhaps the Philippine Legislature is given authority, under certain 
limitations, to legislate upon questions affecting immigration by the 
deportation or exclusion of aliens, it has not as yet done so (sec. 10, Act of 
Congress of August 2'9, 1916, Jones Law) ; (<em>c</em>) that Congress in an Act 
of February 5, 1917 (vol. 39, par. 1, Public Laws of the United States) made 
specific provisions for the deportation and exclusion of aliens; (<em>d</em>) 
that said Act of Congress is the only law, with certain exceptions, in force in 
the Philippine Islands permitting the exclusion or expulsion of aliens and that 
the petitioner is not included in any of the classes mentioned; (<em>e</em>) 
that while certain laws are in force in the Philippine Islands, providing for 
the deportation of certain classes of aliens, under certain conditions named, 
they are not applicable to the petitioner, and (<em>f</em>) that there is 
nothing in the record, nor in the order of deportation, which falls within the 
provisions of said Act .of Congress nor within the provisions of said laws, and 
contends that inasmuch as there is no law authorizing the deportation, the order 
issued for that purpose is illegal and void.</p>
<p>The respondent upon the other hand contends that express authority for the 
exercise of the power by the Governor- General in the premises is found in 
(<em>a</em>) section 69 of Act No. 2711; (<em>b</em>) by virtue of the general 
powers conferred upon him by reason of his being made the supreme executive 
power in the Philippine Islands under section 21 of the Jones Law; (<em>c</em>) 
that under the decision of this court in the case of Severino <em>vs</em>. 
Governor-General and Provincial Board of Occidental Negros (16 Phil. Rep., 366) 
the court can not inquire into the legality of the acts of the Governor-General, 
and (d) by reason of the existence of some general rule of international 
law.</p>
<p>With reference to the first contention of the respondent, an examination of 
said section (69) discloses the fact that it provides a <em>procedure only</em> 
for the deportation of the "subjects of a foreign power." There is not a word of 
express authority found in said section. It contains an assumption that the 
power exists and provides that it shall be exercised in the manner therein 
indicated. May the courts assume that the power, to deport aliens, was given by 
the Legislature to the Governor-General simply from the fact that said section 
provides a procedure for the deportation of subjects of a foreign power? Suppose 
it be admitted, for the purpose of the argument, that section 69 does, in fact, 
create the right to deport aliens. When and under what circumstances may such 
right be exercised? The Act itself is silent upon that question. Does the 
section attempt to say what aliens may be deported? Does it include friendly as 
well as enemy aliens? The section again contains no answer. Does it define when 
and for what acts they may be deported? The section will be examined in vain for 
a reply. Did the Legislature intend, by creating the supposed power, that some 
individual or official in the Government might determine, according to his 
particular whim or caprice, the facts, the acts, and the conditions under which 
it might be exercised? In the Philippine Islands <em>no</em> act is a crime 
unless it is made so by law. The law must specify the particular act or acts 
constituting the crime. If that were not so, the inhabitants could not know when 
they would be liable to be arrested, tried and punished. Otherwise the mandatory 
provisions of the law, that all criminal laws shall be prescribed, would prove 
to be a pitfall and a snare. The inhabitants of the Philippine Islands, whether 
citizens, denizens or friendly aliens, have a right to know, in advance of 
arrest, trial and punishment, the particular acts for which they may be so 
tried. They cannot be arrested and tried, and then be informed for the first 
time that their acts have been subsequently made a crime, and be punished 
therefor. While it is true that the deportation of aliens is not a criminal 
action, in fact, it is, nevertheless, a procedure by which they are deprived of 
their liberties, which cannot be done except by due process of law. Due process 
of law implies that there must be both a law and a procedure. The law must 
define the conditions under which the procedure shall be based. And the 
procedure must be such as to afford ample opportunity for a full and fair 
defense. Said section, if it is to be given the effect contended for", violates 
every requirement that laws shall be prescribed.</p>
<p>And, moreover, if an examination of said section 69 be made, in relation with 
its antecedents (Acts Nos. 1986 and 2113), it will be seen that, even though it 
be conceded that the Legislature had authority to grant the power exercised in 
the premises, <em>it never intended to confer the power but simply to provide a 
method of procedure</em> for the exercise of the supposed power. The preamble or 
whereases in said antecedents (Acts Nos. 1986 and 2113) expressly state that 
inasmuch as <em>"it has been decided"</em> that the power to deport aliens 
exists in the Governor-General, then he must exercise it in the manner therein 
defined. That is a very different condition from what would have resulted had 
the Legislature said; "The Governor-General is hereby given the power to deport 
aliens for reasons mentioned, and when he does so, he shall follow a particular 
procedure." In their last analysis, the effect and meaning of said Acts (Acts 
Nos. 1986 and 2113) and of said section (69) are simply that the Legislature 
said that "if the power to deport aliens exists in the Governor-General for any 
reason in his opinion sufficient, then he must exercise it according to the 
method prescribed."</p>
<p>While there is some apparent conflict in the authorities, we are of the 
opinion, especially in matters touching the life, liberty and property of the 
inhabitants of the Philippine Islands, that no substantive law or power can be 
created by the mere adoption of a simple procedural law. A procedural law 
purely, which does not define the particular conditions and circumstances to 
which it may apply, cannot be construed into the creation of rights and powers 
which do not otherwise exist. In our opinion, section 69 was adopted under a 
misapprehension of the actual state of the law as it exists now and cannot be 
held to have established the right to exercise the power or authority contended 
for in the premises.</p>
<p>With reference to the second contention of the respondent, that the 
Governor-General has the power to deport aliens by virtue of the fact that he is 
made "the supreme executive power" under the Jones Law, it may be said that 
<em>that fact does not authorize him to do what the law has not authorized</em>. 
Under and by virtue of said power, it is his duty to see that the laws are 
faithfully and justly executed. He is not authorized to legislate—that power is 
expressly conferred upon the Philippine Legislature by virtue of sections 8 and 
12 of the Jones Law, with certain limitations. The power to legislate is 
expressly delegated to others. The duties of the Governor-General, under the 
Jones Law, are specified and limited and defined, prior to the passage of the 
Jones Law, the power of the Governor-General was general and not specifically 
defined by any Act of Congress (Acts of Congress March, 1901; July 2, 1902). The 
Government of the Philippine Islands is a <em>government by law</em>. As the 
Chief Executive it is the duty of the Governor-General to execute the 
<em>laws</em> and not his <em>will</em>. We are of the opinion that, in the 
Philippine Islands today under the Jones Law, as everywhere else under the 
American flag, <em>there is no sovereign except the people and no ruler except 
the law</em>. The public officials are the mere instrumentalities through which 
the sovereign speaks and acts.</p>
<p>Justice Miller, in the case of United States <em>vs</em>. Lee (106 U. S., 
196), in discussing the obedience of public officials to the law, said: "The 
<em>law</em> is the only supreme power in our system of government, and every 
man who, by accepting an office, participates in its functions, is only the more 
strongly bound to submit to <em>that</em> supremacy, and to observe the 
limitations which <em>it</em> imposes upon the exercise of the authority which 
it gives."</p>
<p>The respondent further contends that, under the decision of this court in the 
case of Severino <em>vs</em>. Governor-General and Provincial Board of 
Occidental Negros (16 Phil Rep., 366), this court cannot inquire into the 
legality of the detention of the petitioner. That case was an action to compel, 
by mandamus, the Governor-General to do certain things in the doing or not doing 
of which he had the right to exercise his discretion. The court simply held that 
it would not, by mandamus, require him to exercise, in a particular way, duties 
the performance of which was within his discretion. The court simply followed 
the general doctrine in such cases. There is but little analogy between a case 
where the courts are called upon to require a particular official to exercise 
his discretion and a case where he is acting but without authority and is 
illegally depriving persons of rights guaranteed to them by the fundamental law 
of the land. For further answer to that contention reference is hereby, made to 
the argument above on the jurisdiction of the courts to make the present 
inquiry.</p>
<p>In this relation it may be noted however that the Governor-General is not a 
party to the present proceedings. The court is not called upon to require the 
Governor-General to act nor to restrain him from acting. The court is called 
upon to decide whether or not the order of deportation in question is authorized 
by law. It is unnecessary to repeat again the argument presented above to 
support the right of the court, in a habeas corpus proceeding, to inquire into 
the legality of the act of any officer or individual who in any way whatsoever 
deprives <em>any persons</em> of their liberty without authority of law.</p>
<p>With reference to the contention of the respondent that the exercise of the 
right to deport "subject of a foreign power" may be found in some rule of 
international law, we deem it sufficient to say that no rules of international 
law are, as such, inforceable or cognizable by the Philippine Government nor by 
the officials thereof. The Philippine Government has no international relations 
except through the Federal Government of the United States. All questions 
affecting international relations are expressly reserved to the political 
department of the Federal Government. (Constitution of the United States.)</p>
<p>We deem it unnecessary here to discuss or to consider the power to deport 
aliens as it existed under the Spanish Government in the Philippine Islands for 
the reason that whatever power existed then, existed as a political power and 
that whatever that was, the same has been abrogated by a change in sovereignty, 
and is therefore not in force or effect now. (American Insurance Co. 
<em>vs</em>. Canter, 1 Peters [U. S.] 511, 543.)</p>
<p>Returning to a consideration of the contention of the petitioner to wit: that 
the power to deport aliens does not <em>now</em> exist in the Philippine 
Government, whatever might have been its powers prior to the adoption of the 
Jones Law, it may be said, that the Jones Law has created for the Filipino 
people, practically an autonomous government. The Jones Law is a charter of 
express powers, it is the constitution, the fundamental law of the Philippine 
Archipelago. By the Jones Law, the people of the Philippines are expressly 
granted practically all of the powers which are granted to the inhabitants of 
the territories in the United States. These powers are enumerated and specified. 
Under the Jones Law <em>all</em> the powers of government no longer exist in the 
Government of the Philippine Islands. The Philippine Islands is not an 
independent sovereignty. (See preamble to Jones Law.) The Government now 
established must find authority in that <em>law</em>, or in <em>some other 
law</em>, either expressly or by implication, for its exercise of powers. It is 
no longer exercising any inherited military powers. If authority for the 
exercise of a particular power cannot be found in some law the presumption must 
be that it does not exist. Accepting the doctrine announced by the Supreme Court 
of the United States in the Forbes case, that the power to deport aliens existed 
only by virtue of the "combined powers of the legislative and executive 
departments of the Philippine Government" as it then existed, we proceed to an 
examination of the Jones Law and such other laws as may be found affecting the 
present powers of the Government, for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not 
such power exists now. If no such authority in law is found to exist in any of 
such laws, then we must conclude that the exercise of the same in the premises 
is illegal and void, and that the petitioner is deprived of his liberty without 
due process of law and must be discharged from custody.</p>
<p>1. Is there any law conferring upon the legislative department of the 
Philippine Government to provide for the deportation of "subjects of a foreign 
power?" 2. Is there any law conferring like powers upon the executive department 
of the Government? And 3. Is there any law in force in the Philippine Islands 
which authorizes said departments, in their combined powers, to deport the 
petitioner?</p>
<p>With reference to the legislative department, we find that certain powers are 
expressly conferred and others are expressly forbidden by the Jones Law. 
(Sections 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11.) While still other powers are granted with 
certain fixed limitations. (Sections 7, 8, 9, and 10.) While at the same time 
the Government of the United States reserves the right not only to legislate for 
the Philippines, but in certain cases to nullify and veto the acts of the 
Legislature. (Sections 5, 9, and 10.) While the Legislature is given power, 
subject to the limitations imposed, to adopt laws affecting immigrations 
(section 10), that power has not yet been exercised, and it is not at all 
certain, due to said limitations, that any act adopted may <em>ever</em> become 
a law. But it is contended that the Legislature has, in fact, legislated and has 
created authority for the issuance of the order in question by virtue of said 
section 69 of Act No. 2711. In answer to that contention reference is made to 
the argument above where we expressed the opinion that that section did not 
create the right to deport the petitioner. Is there any other law or laws which 
confer the power in question upon the Legislature? As has been noted above there 
are other laws, but they neither confer the power nor justify its exercise in 
the premises.</p>
<p>Does the power contended for by the respondent exist now in the 
Governor-General under the Jones Law or any other law? The petitioner asserts 
that it does not, and contends that even though it did formerly, the same has 
been revoked by implication by virtue of an Act of Congress (March 5, 1917; 39 
Stat. at L., p. 874) which expressly regulates the power and has substituted 
another law regulating the "Immigration of aliens into, and residence of aliens 
in, the United States" and its dependencies. Said Act is expressly made 
applicable to the Philippines (section 1). Said Act of Congress expressly 
provides that "all other acts and parts of acts inconsistent with this Act are 
hereby repealed," (section 38) subject to certain exceptions specifically 
enumerated. The Jones Law is not mentioned among the said exceptions. We must 
conclude, therefore, even though there existed authority in the Jones Law, 
either expressly or impliedly, that it does not exist now.</p>
<p>But the respondent further contends that the power exercised in the premises 
exists in the Governor-General by virtue of being vested with "the supreme 
executive power" (sec. 21). An examination of section 21 discloses that while 
"the executive power" is vested in the Governor-General, the same section at the 
same time points out and specifically enumerates the particular powers which he 
may exercise and no mention is made of the power here contended for. There might 
be some merit in the contention of the respondent if it were not for the "final 
provision of said section 21 which says that "he (the Governor-General) 
<em>shall perform such additional duties</em> and <em>functions</em> as may, in 
pursuance of law, be delegated or assigned to him by the President." If it had 
been the intention of Congress to confer upon the Governor-General any other 
power, or general powers, not enumerated in said section 21, then, why did it at 
the same time further provide for the performance of such <em>additional 
duties</em> and <em>functions</em> as might be conferred "in pursuance of law as 
might be delegated to him?" The fact that the powers expressly conferred and 
specifically enumerated with the provision that others might be given justifies 
the inference that those expressed power are the only powers possessed until 
others are given. We are not of the opinion that the power contended for is 
found in the Jones Law, either expressly or by implication.</p>
<p>The Act of Congress of February 5, 1917, provides that that law shall be 
enforced in the Philippine Islands by the "officers of the General Government 
thereof." May the power in question be claimed under that provision by the 
Governor-General? There, might be some basis for that contention if the 
petitioner belonged to any of the classes of persons who might be expelled under 
said law. Said law specifically mentions all the classes of aliens who may be 
excluded or expelled. It not having been shown that the petitioner belongs to 
any one of the classes of persons mentioned in said Act, it cannot be made to 
apply to him and he cannot be deported by virtue of any of the provisions 
thereof. Even that law does not confer upon the Governor-General the power or 
authority to deport him.</p>
<p>Does the right to deport the petitioner exist by virtue of the combined 
powers of the executive and legislative departments of the Philippine 
Government? If such combined power exist it is only by virtue of said section 
69. No other law has been cited nor invoked to sustain that contention. What has 
been said above, reference to which is hereby made, sufficiently negatives that 
contention.</p>
<p align="center">CONCLUSIONS.</p>
<p>From all of the foregoing, our conclusions are:</p>
<p>1. That the court is not only authorized and given complete authority in 
proceedings like the present to inquire into the legality of the order in 
question, but it is under the <em>legal</em> obligation so to do.</p>
<p>2. That while the Legislature is given authority, subject to certain 
limitations, to adopt immigration laws it has not done so.</p>
<p>3. That there is no law now nor legal authority existing in any person or 
department of the Philippine Government, nor in any combination of such power or 
authority, to deport the petitioner under the admitted facts as they appear of 
record.</p>
<p>It should; therefore, be ordered and decreed that the remedy prayed for be 
granted, that the bond heretofore given to secure his temporary release should 
be cancelled and that he should be released from the custody of the law.</p>
<p>It should be so ordered, without costs.</p>

<p><em><strong>DISSENTING OPINION</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>MALCOLM, J.</strong>, <em>dissenting:</em></p>
<p>After listening to the brilliant argument of council and after an intense and 
a conscientious study of the various phases of this important case, I have felt 
it my duty to set forth my views in a separate opinion. As announced in public 
hearing, I have before coming on the bench taken part in the preparation of the 
opinion of the Attorney-General of June 8, 1910, and in the submission of the 
position of the Government in Severino <em>vs</em>. Governor-General and 
Provincial Board<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of Negros Occidental, 
Forbes <em>vs</em>. Chuoco Tiaco and Crossfield,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Tiaco <em>vs</em>. Forbes,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and Chan Yick Sam <em>vs</em>. Prosecuting 
Attorney,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> all referred to in the 
argument and all given up to rendering more secure the position of the 
Governor-General. The attitude of the advocate may still lurk in my mental 
processes. Yet, even for these reasons, to have retired from a case of more than 
ordinary public significance, would have seemed to have shirked my full 
responsibility. With this personal prelude, I have to reach a decision through 
cumulative legal formulae sifted out of a formidable array of authorities.</p>
<p>Petitioner asks this court to grant a writ of habeas corpus. The acting chief 
of police of the city of Manila through the Attorney-General by way of return 
states that petitioner is held for deportation by reason of an order of the 
Governor-General.</p>
<p>A sketch of the right of the Governor-General of the Philippine Islands to 
deport aliens therefrom, edging into the present case, will serve to put the 
issues in their proper perspective.</p>
<p>Under Spain, the right to expel aliens from the Philippine Islands was vested 
in the administrative discretion of the Governor-General, first by the Real 
Cedula of March 11, 1819, and later by the Royal Order of August 2, 1888. After 
American occupation, the first known attempt to exercise such a power grew into 
the decision of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands in the case of 
Forbes <em>vs</em>. Chuoco Tiaco and Crossfield ([1910], 16 Phil. Rep., 534). 
The decision of Justice Johnson, with whom concurred the Chief Justice and 
Justice Torres, reached the following conclusions:</p>
<p>"First. That the Government of the United States in the Philippine Islands is 
a Government possessed with 'all the military, civil, and judicial power 
necessary to govern the Philippine Islands' and as such has the power and duty, 
through its political department, to deport aliens whose presence in the 
territory is found to be injurious to the public good and domestic tranquility 
of the people.</p>
<p>"Second. That the Governor-General, acting in his political and executive 
capacity, is invested with plenary power to deport obnoxious aliens whose 
continued presence in the territory is found by him to be injurious to the 
public interest, and in the absence of express and prescribed rules as to the 
method of deporting or expelling them, he may use such methods as his official 
judgment and good conscience may dictate.</p>
<p>"Third. That this power to deport or expel obnoxious aliens being invested in 
the political department of the Government, the judicial department will not, in 
the absence of express legislative authority, intervene for the purpose of 
controlling such power, nor for the purpose of inquiring whether or not he is 
liable in damages for the exercise thereof."</p>
<p>Justice Moreland, with whom concurred Justice Trent, reached the same result 
in a separate concurring opinion. Their conclusions were:</p>
<p>"First. * * * that the act was in the nature of a judicial act, the functions 
exercised were judicial in their quality and that he (the Governor-General) 
should have the same protection against civil liability in exercising this 
function that would be accorded to a court under similar circumstances.</p>
<p>"Second. * * * that the Government here is one of three! 
departments—executive, legislative, and judicial— that the office of the 
Governor-General is one of the coordinate branches of the Government, and that 
the same public policy which relieves a member of the Legislature or a member of 
the judiciary from personal liability for their official acts also relieves the 
Governor-General in like cases."</p>
<p>Pending resolution in the Philippine courts, the Legislature passed Act No. 
1986 by which the action of the Governor-General was "approved, ratified, 
confirmed, and in all respects declared legal and not subject to question or 
review." This Act was considered by the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands 
in reaching its decision. Following this decision and during the time taken to 
appeal to the United States Supreme Court, the Legislature enacted Act No. 2113, 
from its title "An Act regulating the authority of the Governor-General of the 
Philippine Islands to deport exclude, expel, or repatriate foreigners." The 
United States Supreme Court in Tiaco <em>vs</em>. Forbes ([1913] 228 U. S., 
549), affirmed the judgment of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands, 
saying that "in substance the decision of the Supreme Court was right." 
Thereafter, the Philippine Legislature in preparing the Administrative Codes of 
1916 and 1917 carried into them a replica of Act No. 2113, undoubtedly under the 
belief, as expressed in said Act No, 2113, that the Governor-General of the 
Philippine Islands had authority to expel foreigners.</p>
<p>With the decision of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands, affirmed by 
the Supreme Court of the United States, apparently deciding that the 
Governor-General had the power to expel aliens, and with section 69 of the 
Administrative Code, providing the procedure to be followed, investigation was 
begun in accordance therewith to determine whether R. McCulloch Dick, now the 
petitioner, shall be deported. Thereafter, an order was issued by the 
Governor-General directing the deportation of Dick to Hongkong. Every fair 
inference points to the conclusion that the Governor-General acted in good faith 
under the genuine belief that he was so authorized by law, and that he was 
impelled to perform the duty to protect and advance the vital interests of the 
United States and the Philippines in the war. Had not the Chief Executive 
understood that he had such power, there is not the slightest doubt but what he 
would have refrained from any action in the premises. No executive official in 
these Islands has ever been more careful to safeguard the law or more solicitous 
of the rights of the Legislature and the courts than the present 
Governor-General. The writer can more readily understand the existent mistake, 
if any, when he recalls that in another place he set down the following:</p>
<p>" 'The Government of the Philippine Islands', as said by Mr. Justice Johnson 
of its Supreme Court in the sensational case of Forbes <em>vs</em>. Chuoco Tiaco 
and Crossfield, 'may prevent the entrance into or eliminate from its borders all 
such aliens whose presence is found to be detrimental or injurious to its public 
interest, peace, and domestic tranquility.' In the same case on appeal to the 
United States Supreme Court, Justice Holmes expressed the opinion for the Court 
that the Philippine Government had the right of deportation 'as an incident of 
the self-determination, however limited, given to it by the United States.' This 
power belongs to the political department of the Government—in the Philippine 
Islands, to the Governor-General. Act No. 2113 of the Philippine Legislature 
(Adm. Code, sec. 83), regulating the authority of the Chief Executive to expel 
foreigners, provides for a prior investigation and hearing,"</p>
<p align="center">JURISDICTION.</p>
<p>The first questions which present themselves go to our right to act at all. 
Who is to determine whether the Governor-General has the power to expel 
aliens—the Governor-General or the courts? If the answer by the courts, will 
this be taken to mean that the judiciary has encroached on the field of the 
Executive and in so doing broken down the independence of departments? Will 
authoritative decisions of the United States Supreme Court and of the Supreme 
Court of the Philippine Islands permit the courts to assume jurisdiction?</p>
<p>We must step through the threshold of the case into the midst of great 
principles of Constitutional Law and Political Science. We must perforce analyze 
the most fundamental attributes of the Government of the Philippine Islands.</p>
<p>The powers entrusted to the Government of the Philippine Islands are 
distributed among three independent departments, the Executive, the Legislative, 
and the Judicial. Every governmental step since American occupation of the 
Philippine Islands has developed this triple division of powers. Each department 
has separate and distinct function. Each department is coordinate and coequal 
with the other departments. Executive authority is vested in the 
Governor-General. Legislative authority is vested in the Philippine Legislature. 
Judicial authority is vested in the courts. With the exercise of these powers, 
another department cannot interfere. The temptation to extend the sphere of 
influence of any one department to another must be zealously guarded 
against.</p>
<p>The cases when examined reinforced these principles. The United States 
Supreme Court first impliedly in Marbury <em>vs</em>. Madison ([1803], 1 Cranch, 
173), and later directly in State of Mississippi <em>vs</em>. Johnson ([1867], 
71 U. S., 475), held that the courts will never assume jurisdiction over the 
official acts of the President. The Supreme Court of the Philippines in Severino 
<em>vs</em>. Governor-General and Provincial Board of Negros Occidental [1910], 
16 Phil., 366) after an exhaustive study of the authorities concluded with these 
words: "After due consideration, and being fully aware of the seriousness of the 
question, we have reached the conclusion that we have no jurisdiction to 
interfere with the Governor-General of these Islands, as the head of the 
executive department, in the performance of any of his official acts." The 
doctrines enunciated by these cases must not be disturbed.</p>
<p>The delicacy of the question is apparent when we come to realize the position 
of the Governor-General. The Organic Law gives to him supreme executive power. 
He more than any one else personifies sovereignty. He more than any one else is 
the Government. In the exercise of his important duties, he is responsible not 
to the courts but, through the President, to the sovereign people. Any collision 
between the Chief Executive and the highest court in the Philippines is to be 
deplored.</p>
<p>This position it is urged may leave a person without a remedy. The answer is 
that it leaves possible wrongs without a judicial remedy. Final decision must be 
left somewhere. In one instance it may be with the Legislature, in another 
instance with the Executive, and in another instance with the courts. The courts 
are not the repository of all wisdom. Mistakes are just as liable to occur in 
the course of judicial proceedings as in executive or legislative proceedings. 
The presumption in favor of the correctness of executive action or legislative 
action is just as conclusive as of the justness of judicial action.</p>
<p>To maintain the balance of powers one department must act as a check on the 
others. It would then sometimes seem that one department has trespassed on the 
powers of the other department. Not necessarily so. The mere abstract statement 
of the principle discloses the reason. In a case which authoritatively 
considered this very subject, it was said: "The legislature must enact laws 
<em>subject to the limitations of the organic laws</em>, * * * The executive 
must execute <em>such laws as are constitutionally enacted</em>. The judiciary, 
as in all governments operating under written constitutions, <em>must determine 
the validity of legislative enactments, as well as the legality of all private 
and official act</em>." (U. S. <em>vs</em>. Bull [1910], 15 Phil., 7.) More 
specifically stated, in the case of Province of Tarlac <em>vs</em>. Gale, 
([1913], 26 Phil., 338), it was said: "That the court may declare a law passed 
by the legislature unconstitutional and void, or <em>an act of the executive 
unauthorized and illegal</em>; or that the legislature may curtail within limits 
the jurisdiction and power of the courts, or restrict, in a measure, the scope 
of the executive action; or that the executive may, by his veto, render null and 
ineffective the acts of the Legislature and thus effectually thwart the purposes 
of the. majority, does not affect that independence. These are merely the checks 
and balances made by the people through the constitution inherent in the form of 
government for its preservation as an effective institution. In spite of these 
checks and balances, if not by reason of them, the fundamental departments of 
the Government are independent of each other in the true sense of the word. The 
quality of government consists in their remaining so." And finally, with 
particular application to the situation before us, we note the language of the 
United States Federal Courts as follows: "It has been settled from the adoption 
of the Constitution of the United States, dividing the powers of government into 
three departments, that the judiciary cannot properly interfere with executive 
action when the executive officer <em>is authorized</em> to exercise his 
judgment or discretion." (Dudley <em>vs</em>. James [1897], 83 Fed., 345, 349. 
See also Noble <em>vs</em>. Union River Logging R. Co. [1893], 147 U. S., 
165.)</p>
<p>Instances are known in American" Constitutional History where executive have 
claimed the right to construe the constitution for themselves independently of 
the judiciary and in defiance of it. Presidents Jefferson, Jackson, and Lincoln 
thus took to themselves this function. These are the exceptions. It is now an 
established principle that it is for the courts to construe the constitution and 
to determine what the law is. (M'Culloch <em>vs</em>. Maryland [1819] 4 Wheat, 
316; <em>Re</em> Debs [1895], 158 U. S., 564.) The courts of the Philippines now 
possess and exercise, not recklessly but cautiously, this power of construing 
the Philippine Organic Law and of determining when either the legislative or the 
executive departments steps outside the limits fixed by law. In so doing, the 
courts do not usurp authority not belonging to them but merely stand between the 
sovereign, the people, and officials in other branches.</p>
<p>As heretofore stated we have the Governor-General acting in good faith in the 
exercise of a disagreeable duty in conformity with what is supposed to be the 
law. How that duty shall be performed is left to his discretion. Just as surely, 
however, it is the duty of the courts to determine if the Governor-General is 
empowered by any law to take action. In one sense the judiciary is an official 
adviser to the other powers. When the judiciary finds that the Legislature has 
put on the statute books an illegal law, it wipes that law out and puts the 
Legislature back into its proper sphere. When the judiciary finds that the Chief 
Executive has mistakenly attempted to perform an unauthorized act it will not 
interfere with the Executive in the performance of that act, but more correctly 
stated, will advise him as to whether or not he is authorized by any law to take 
such action. As said in the concurring opinion in the case of Forbes 
<em>vs</em>. Chuoco Tiaco and Crossfield <em>supra</em>: <em>"The judiciary has 
full power to, and will, when the matter is properly presented to it and the 
occasion justly warrants it, declare an act of the Governor-General illegal and 
void</em> and place as nearly as possible in <em>status quo</em> any person who 
has been deprived of his liberty or his property by such act. This remedy is 
assured to every person, however humble or of whatever country, when his 
personal or property rights have been invaded, even by the highest authority of 
the state." The United States Supreme Court has likewise never hesitated when 
executive authority has been exceeded to so declare.</p>
<p>The Government of the Philippine Islands is essentially a Government of laws 
and not of men. The policy of the law is against the placing of unlimited power 
anywhere. All officers from the highest to the lowest and in all branches of the 
Government are subordinate to the law. A judge, equally with any official of the 
other departments, it has been said, "is not above or beyond the law, which it 
is his high office to administer." (Alzua and Arnalot <em>vs</em>. Johnson 
[1912], 21 Phil., 308.) "The law," Justice Miller said in U. S. <em>vs</em>. Lee 
([1882], 106 U. S., 196), "is the only supreme power in our system of 
government, and every man who by accepting office participates in its functions 
is only the more strongly bound to submit to that supremacy, and to observe the 
limitations which it imposed upon the exercise of the authority which it gives." 
Having no doubt that both the executive and the legislative departments of the 
Philippine Government are just as anxious as we are to maintain the supremacy of 
the law, and it being the peculiar duty of the courts to know the law, we must 
proceed in our search for those statutes which may authorize the deportation of 
aliens.</p>
<p>Before we conclude our discussion of this point, we must not forget to take 
cognizance of the fact that we are not asked to enjoin or command the 
Governor-General. The prayer is that the Supreme Court issue a <em>writ of 
habeas corpus</em> directed to the acting chief of police of the city of Manila. 
A slight conception of the history and principles of this writ will effectively 
indicate the necessity for vigorous action on the part of the courts.</p>
<p>The writ of habeas corpus has for centuries been esteemed the best and only 
sufficient defense of personal freedom. It was in use even before the days of 
the Magna Charta. But the English judges being under the influence of the Crown, 
the writ afforded no real protection to British subjects. To remedy this evil, 
the celebrated Habeas Corpus Act of 1679, (31 Car., II), was enacted for the 
purpose of securing the benefits for which the writ was given. The writ went 
with Englishmen to the shores of the United States as one of their dearest 
possessions. From the United States it was brought to the Philippine Islands as 
the cornerstone of the Philippine Bill of Rights. Here the writ of habeas corpus 
will remain as long as democracy survives.</p>
<p>The writ of habeas corpus is essentially a writ of inquiry. It has often been 
used to defend the liberty of the citizen against the assertion of unlawful 
authority on the part of the executive and legislative branches of the 
Government. (U. S. <em>vs</em>. Lee [1882], 106 U. S., 196, 220; <em>Ex 
parte</em> Milligan [1866], 4 Wall., 2; Kilbourn <em>vs</em>. Thompson [1881], 
103 U. S., 168; Carfer <em>vs</em>. Caldwell [1906], 200 U. S., 293.) In the 
language of a great judge (Chief Justice Kent), "It is the indispensable duty of 
this court, and one to which every inferior consideration must be sacrificed, to 
act as a faithful guardian of the personal liberty of the citizen, and to give 
ready and effectual aid to the means provided by law for its security. Nor can 
we hesitate in promptly enforcing a due return to the writ when we recollect 
that in this country, the law knows no superior; and that in England their 
courts have taught us, by a series of instructive examples, to exact the 
strictest obedience to whatever extent the persons to whom the writ is directed 
may be clothed with power or exalted in rank." (<em>Ex parte</em> Stacy [1813], 
10 Johns, 327.) The only official not subject to the writ (and this exception 
merely mentioned in <em>dicta</em> in an isolated case, <em>In re</em> Keeler 
[1843], 14 Fed. Cas., No. 7637) is the President of the United States. The 
provisions of the Constitution, especially those pertaining to due process of 
law and personal rights, protect resident aliens as well as citizens. (Yick Wo 
<em>vs</em>. Hopkins [1885], 118 U. S., 356; Fong Yue Ting <em>vs</em>. U. S. 
[1893], 149 U. S., 698.) In short the writ of habeas corpus is "a high mandate, 
by means of which courts or judges, in protection of the liberty of individuals, 
exercise functions appertaining to the sovereign power, and which in intendment 
of law rest only in the sovereign and are coextensive with his dominion." 
(<em>Ex parte</em> Burras [1890], 136 U. S., 586.)</p>
<p>Our law carries with it all the applicable principles of English and American 
cases on the subject of habeas corpus. In statutory form it says that the writ 
shall extend to all cases of illegal detention by which any person is deprived 
of his liberty. (Sec. 525, Code of Civil Procedure.) Again our law says that, 
"if no <em>legal cause</em> is shown for the imprisonment or a continuation of 
the restraint imposed upon the person, the court or judge must discharge him 
from the custody or restraint under which he is held." (Sec. 89, Code of 
Criminal Procedure.)</p>
<p>We conclude that it is for the court to determine if the Governor-General has 
the power to expel aliens. If it be found that Governor-General does possess 
this power by reason of any law, then the exercise of it is an official act and 
beyond the interference of the courts. "<em>Whenever a statute</em> gives a 
discretionary power to any person, to be exercised, by him upon his own opinion 
of certain facts, it is a sound rule of construction that the statute 
constitutes him the sole and exclusive judge of the existence of those facts." 
(Per Story, J., in Martin <em>vs</em>. Mott [1827], 12 Wheat, 19, 31.) But if it 
be found that there is no law authorizing the Governor-General to deport aliens, 
then any attempt of the Governor-General to undertake to do so would not be an 
official act, and it would be the resultant duty of the courts through the great 
writ of habeas corpus to protect the petitioner.</p>
<p>We have to discuss the general subject of—</p>
<p align="center">THE POWER OF THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL OF THE PHILIPPINE<br>ISLANDS 
TO EXPEL ALIENS THEREFROM.</p>
<p>Every sovereignty for social, economic, or political reasons, as protection 
to public safety or public order and as a police measure, has the inherent and 
absolute right, essential to self-preservation to expel or deport aliens. In the 
United States "the doctrine is firmly established that the power to exclude or 
expel aliens is vested in the political departments of the Government, to be 
regulated by treaty or by Act of Congress, and to be executed by the executive 
authority according to such regulations * * *. (Fok Yung Yo <em>vs</em>. United 
States [1902], 185 U. S., 296. See further <em>In re</em> Patterson [1902], 1 
Phil., 93; the Chinese Exclusion Case [1889], 130 U. S., 581; Fong Yue Ting 
<em>vs</em>. United States [1892], 149 U. S., 698; 1 Oppenheim, International 
Law, pages 378, 382, and 4 Moore, International Law Digest, pages 71 <em>et 
seq</em>.) The authorities usually assume the primary authority as in Congress. 
(Wong Wing <em>vs</em>. U. S. [1895], 163 U. S., 228; Tiaco <em>vs</em>. Forbes 
[1913], 228 U. S., 549.)</p>
<p>The right of the Governor-General of the Philippine Islands to expel aliens, 
if it exists, must either be sought in the power inherent in him because of his 
position and the legal status of the Philippines, or in some Treaty or Act of 
Congress authorizing the same, or in some attribute of the Military Governor of 
the Philippines, which has been transmitted to the Governor-General, or in some 
previous law of Spain still in force in the Islands, or in some action of the 
Philippine Legislature sanctioning or authorizing, or in some extraordinary 
power brought into being by the exigencies of the present war. We proceed by 
process of exclusion to an analysis of these six possibilities in the order 
named—</p>
<p>1. "It is admitted" as said in Tiaco <em>vs</em>. Forbes, <em>supra</em>, 
"that <em>sovereign states</em> have inherent power to deport aliens." If the 
Philippine Islands can be taken to be sovereign in this sense, then it has this 
right; otherwise the contrary is true.</p>
<p>The Government of the Philippine Islands is not that of either a State or a 
Territory of the United States, but is a complete government organism, outside 
the constitutional relations which unite the States and Territories into the 
Union. The Filipino people enjoy practical self-government. The nearest 
prototype is the Commonwealth of Australia.</p>
<p>The Act of Congress most nearly in the form of a constitution for the 
Philippines, the Act of August 29, 1916, popularly known as the Jones Law, 
provided "<em>a more autonomous government</em> for the Philippines." This meant 
that while previously the Islands had had an autonomous government, they were 
thereafter to have one more nearly independent and more perfectly 
self-governing. Yet in the same Act, Congress was careful to state that "Whereas 
for the speady accomplishment of such purpose it is desirable to place in the 
hands of the people of the Philippines as large a control of their domestic 
affairs as can be given them <em>without, in the meantime, impairing the 
exercise of the rights of sovereignty by the people of the United States</em>, 
etc."</p>
<p>Sovereignty, therefore, in so far as the Philippines is concerned still 
resides in the United States, i. e. the people of the United States are the 
depository of this ultimate sovereignty. This is the sovereignty, which for the 
United States and the Philippines retains the inherent right to deport aliens. 
Until it expresses itself through its representative, the Congress of the United 
States, or by other means, it must be presumed to have retained the 
high,prerogative. While the distance of the Philippine Islands from the United 
States, and while the imperative necessity of taking action promptly to 
safeguard the interest of the Islands may constitute powerful, reasons for the 
existence of such authority in the Governor-General, this is primarily a matter 
of policy to be determined by the sovereign and cannot be taken over without the 
permission of this sovereign. While also language can be found in the decision 
in Forbes <em>vs</em>. Chuoco Tiaco and Crossfield ([1910], 16 Phil., 534) to 
the effect that the mere absence of legislation regulating this inherent right 
to deport or expel aliens is not sufficient to prevent the Chief Executive head 
of the Government acting in his own sphere and in accordance with his official 
duty, to deport or expel objectionable aliens when he deems such action 
necessary for the peace and domestic tranquility of the nation, this must be 
regarded as language not confirmed on appeal by the United States Supreme 
Court.</p>
<p>The Government of the Philippine Islands, and thus the Governor-General has 
no inherent right to expel aliens.</p>
<p>2. No treaty governing the right of the Governor-General to expel aliens is 
known to us.</p>
<p>The Congress of the United States could undoubtedly directly and 
constitutionally authorize the Governor-General of the Philippine Islands to 
expel aliens. The nearest that Congress has come to so doing has been to extend 
the Chinese exclusion and immigration laws and the general immigration laws to 
the Philippine Islands. Congress also on February 5, 1917, enacted "An Act to 
regulate the immigration of aliens to, and the residence of aliens in, the 
United States." This law provides for the deportation of aliens under certain 
definite conditions. It is to "be enforced in the Philippine Islands by officers 
of the General Government thereof, unless and until it is superseded by an act 
passed by the Philippine Legislature and approved by the President of the United 
States." The only later expression of the Philippine Legislature thus approved 
by the President is what is found in section 69 of the Administrative Code of 
1917, going into effect on October 1, 1917. The argument for petitioner as based 
on this Act of Congress and this provision of the Administrative Code, then is 
that the Act of Congress determines in precise language the causes, and the only 
causes, for which foreigners may be expelled from the Philippines and the 
Administrative Code determines the procedure. As a consequence, since the cause 
for which the petitioner is attempted to be deported does not fall within any of 
the provisions of this Act of Congress, it is ably contended that he cannot be 
lawfully deported. In opposition it is said that there is not a single word in 
the Act of Congress which even intimates that aliens may not be deported from 
the Philippine Islands for other reasons than those mentioned in the Act, (Tiaco 
<em>vs</em>. Forbes, <em>supra</em>, cited.) Be this as it may, what is of 
moment is that neither this Act of Congress nor any other Act of Congress 
directly authorizes the present expulsion.</p>
<p>3. Acts of Congress may possibly by indirection authorize the power. As all 
know the Philippines on American occupation were first governed by a Military 
Governor. Following the Military Governor came a Civil Governor, whose title was 
later changed to Governor-General. The order of the President of June 21,1901, 
appointing a Civil Governor. is as follows:</p>
<p>"On and after the 4th day of July, 1901, until it shall be <em>otherwise 
ordered, the President of the Philippine Commission will exercise the executive 
authority in all civil affairs in the government of the Philippine Islands 
heretofore exercised in such affairs by the Military Governor of the 
Philippines</em>, and to that end the Hon. William H. Taft, President of the 
said Commission, is hereby appointed Civil Governor of the Philippine Islands. 
Such executive authority will be exercised under, and in conformity to, the 
instructions to the Philippine Commissioners, dated April 7, 1900, and subject 
to the approval and control of the Secretary of War of the United States. * * 
*"</p>
<p>Section 1 of the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902, (Philippine Bill) is, in 
part, as follows:</p>
<p>"<em>Be it enacted by the Senate and House; of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled</em>, That the action of the President 
of the United States in creating the Philippine Commission and authorizing said 
Commission to exercise the powers of government to the extent and in the manner 
and form and subject to the regulation and control set forth in the instructions 
of the President to the Philippine Commission, dated April seventh, nineteen 
hundred, and in creating the offices of Civil Governor and Vice-Governor of the 
Philippine Islands, and authorizing the said Civil Governor and Vice-Governor to 
exercise the powers of the government to the extent and in the manner and form 
set forth in the executive order dated June twenty-first, nineteen hundred and 
one, * * * is hereby <em>approved, ratified, and confirmed, and until otherwise 
provided by law</em> the said Islands shall continue to be governed as thereby 
and herein provided, * * * "</p>
<p>Section 8 of the Act of Congress of February 6, 1905, changed the title of 
the Civil Governor of the Philippine Islands to that of Governor-General of the 
Philippine Islands.</p>
<p>The instructions of the President to General Merritt, dated May 19, 1898, for 
obvious reasons did not definitely limit the powers of the Military Governor. 
Therein, it was however provided: "Though the powers of the military occupant 
are absolute and supreme, and immediately operate upon the political condition 
of the inhabitants, * * * " The instructions of the President to the Philippine 
Commission had also only stated that "until the complete transfer of control, 
the military governor will remain the executive head of the government of the 
Islands, and will exercise the executive authority now possessed by him and not 
herein expressly assigned to the Commission, subject, however, to the rules and 
orders enacted by the Commission in the exercise of the legislative powers 
conferred upon them."</p>
<p>Military power, when exercised in a territory under military occupation 
includes executive, judicial, and legislative authority. During belligerent 
occupation the power of the military commander is free from constitutional 
limitations on these powers. On the cessation of military operations the 
military commander is subject to certain rules of law of which the most 
important is the principle of "immediate exigency" or "necessity." (Raymond 
<em>vs</em>. Thomas, 1876, 91 U. S., 712). "The authority of a military 
government during the period between the cession and the action of Congress, 
like the authority of the same government before the cession, is of large, 
though it may not be of unlimited extent." (Santiago vs. Nogueras, [1909] 214 U. 
S., 260.) The treaty of peace does not affect the existence of military 
government; the powers of the Military Governor continue even after war has 
ceased. (Cross <em>vs</em>. Harrison, 1853. 16 How., 164, 193; Dooley 
<em>vs</em>. United States, [1902], 182 U. S., 222, 234; Magon's Reports, p. 12 
<em>et seq</em>.) With such extraordinary powers there can be no doubt that a 
military commander during hostilities, or a Military Governor during military 
occupation, would have the right to expel undesirable foreigners.</p>
<p>The Spooner Amendment found in the Act of Congress of March 3, 1901, 
indicated more clearly the unlimited authority of the Chief Executive of the 
Philippines when it provided that:</p>
<p>"<em>All military, civil, and judicial powers necessary to govern the 
Philippine Islands</em>, acquired from Spain by the treaties concluded at Paris 
on the tenth day of December, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, and at 
Washington on the seventh day of November, nineteen hundred, <em>shall, until 
otherwise provided by Congress, be vested in such person and persons and shall 
be exercised in such manner as the President of the United States shall 
direct</em>, for the establishment of civil government and for maintaining and 
protecting the inhabitants of said islands in the free enjoyment of their 
liberty, property, and religion." (31 Stat. at L., 910.)</p>
<p>Congress seems to have "otherwise provided," when after grave deliberation, 
the Government of the Philippine Islands was reorganized by the Jones Law. This 
law in section 21 enumerates certain powers and duties of the Governor-General. 
From this it is argued that while previous to the passage of the Jones Law, the 
Governor-General had general powers, after the enactment of the Jones Law, his 
powers were specific. As the power to expel aliens is not named as one of these 
specific powers, the deduction is then made that he possesses no such 
prerogative. This cannot be granted. Section 6 of the Jones Law continues in 
force and effect the laws in force in the Philippines except as altered, 
amended, or modified by the same law, until they are altered, amended, or 
repealed by the Philippine Legislature or by the Congress pf the United States. 
Section 31 of the Jones Law is not worded as is the customary repealing clause 
but also recognizes the continuation of prior laws. There would be no absolute 
inconsistency between the existence of the powers granted in the Jones Law, 
which merely picked up certain known grants to the Governor-General and restated 
them and the continuation of other powers found in anterior laws and not 
subsequently repealed. The Governor-General appears to possess: 1. The powers 
enumerated in section 21 of the Jones Law; 2. The powers which the last clause 
of said section contemplates the President may assign or delegate to him in 
pursuance of law; and 3. The powers given to the Governor-General by other laws 
not in conflict with the Jones Law.</p>
<p>If this be granted, then the result is this: No law has directly conferred 
this power on the Governor-General or authorized the President to assign it to 
the Chief Executive. To exist, the power must be considered as a legacy from the 
Military Governor. But it does not impress one as reasonable that the power to 
deport aliens was transmitted from the Military Governor to the Civil Governor; 
or if this be resisted, that the power arising because of war existed subsequent 
to the Spooner Amendment after Congress had "otherwise provided" in different 
organic laws reconstituting the Government. It would appear preposterous to 
suppose that a war power free from constitutional limitations would subsist for 
nearly twenty years after peace has been declared and notwithstanding two or 
more organic laws reorganizing the Civil Government.</p>
<p>The right of the Military Governor of the Philippines to expel aliens from 
the Islands does not now exist in the Governor-General.</p>
<p>4. The right to expel aliens from the Philippine Islands under the Spanish 
regime was vested in the administrative discretion of the Governor-General. The 
<em>Real Cedula</em> of March 11,1819, first granted this power, subject to 
judicial determination, in the following language:</p>
<p>"5th. With regard to foreigners who have not committed any crime and can not 
therefore be punished under the laws of the country where under they are liable 
by reason of the residence therein, and it becomes necessary for them to leave 
the country only as a police measure, after <em>judicially showing</em> the just 
motives therefor, they should be returned to their country, whenever necessary; 
otherwise they should be sent to the Peninsula, forwarding the papers and 
certificates with reference thereto. Upon arrival in the Peninsula, and if the 
only motive for their deportation is that their presence in the colonies was 
objectionable, the deported individuals shall be set at liberty and thereby 
enabled to return to their own country." (6 <em>San Pedro, Legislacion 
Ultramarina, p. 78</em>.)</p>
<p>The confidential Royal Order of April 20, 1881, provided that deportations 
(of foreigners) must be decreed by the Governor-General in person and not by any 
subordinate officer, according to the provisions of Law 19, Title 8, Book 7 of 
the Laws of the Indies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Said law last 
cited is as follows:</p>
<p>"An additional provision is granted regarding governors whereby they are 
given power to deport from the country troublesome men, if they deem it 
convenient, notwithstanding an appeal. And because their lieutenants and 
officials attempt to exercise this power and it is not to be extended to 
inferior Officers, we order that it be not executed by those other than our 
governors in person."</p>
<p>By Royal Order of August 2,1888, the Governor-General's power of expulsion 
was separated from the control of the Judiciary, and the expediency of the 
expulsions necessary for the preservation of public order and the kind and form 
of justification required in such cases was left to his reasonable discretion. 
This order as translated into English is as follows:</p>
<p align="center">"OFFICE OF THE COLONIAL SECRETARY.</p>
<p align="center">"NO. 607.</p>
<p>"Excellency: In view of the proceedings relative to the consultation had by 
the Audiencia de Manila with the government, through the supreme court, the 
latter having rendered a report on the subject-matter thereof, which refers to 
deportations, the case was forwarded for report to the political division of 
this office, and His Majesty the King (whom may God preserve), and in his name 
the Queen Regent, passing upon the report, has been pleased to decide that:</p>
<p>" '1. According to laws 18, 19, and 20, title 8, book 7; 35, title 15, book 
2; 7, title 4, book 3; 61, title 3, book 3, the royal cedula of May 19, 1819, 
and the special royal order of April 20, 1881, Governors-General of the 
Philippines have power to determine the legal expediency of the deportations 
which they may deem necessary for the preservation of public order.</p>
<p>" '2. The record in any such cause commenced by the Governor-General must be 
transmitted to the supreme government of the nation, in the form and manner 
provided by the Laws of the Indies, in order that it may take cognizance of the 
reasons which he may have had for ordering the deportation.</p>
<p>"'3. The kind and form of justification which should appear in the record is 
left to the reasonable discretion of the Governor-General.</p>
<p>" '4. The Governor-General may deport any person who, had he been prosecuted 
in the courts of justice under a criminal charge, would have been pardoned, as 
expressed in law 2, title 8, book 7, of the Recompilation of the Laws of the 
Indies.</p>
<p>"'5. With respect to such persons as were tried and acquitted by the courts 
of justice, if the charges, the reason for the deportation, were the 
subject-matter of the prosecution, then, bearing in mind the sanctity of a 
matter which has become <em>res adjudicata</em>, deportation by the 
Governor-General is improper.</p>
<p>" '6. These deportations must be decreed by the Governor General in person, 
and not by his <em>tenientes</em> and <em>auxiliares</em> (lieutenants and 
assistants), in accordance with law 19, title 8, book 7, of the Recompilation of 
the Indies.</p>
<p>" '7. The laws in force in the Philippines relative to deportations are those 
of the Indies before mentioned, so that the lack of a faithful and exact 
compliance with requisites prescribed therein for the exercise of such power 
constitutes the crime defined in articles 211 and 212 of the Penal Code in force 
in the Philippines.</p>
<p>" '8. The right of appeal to the <em>audiencias</em>, granted by royal order 
of May 25, 1847, from the action taken by the Governor-General, was abolished by 
the decree of June 9, 1878 in force in the Philippines by another of November 28 
of the same year, which provides in article 7 that orders issued by the 
Governor-General, in matters pertaining to government or to the exercise of his 
discretional powers, can only be revoked by the Supreme Government.</p>
<p>"The foregoing by this royal order is communicated to you for your 
information and the consequent effects. * * * May God preserve Your Excellency 
many years. * * * Madrid, August 2, 1888.</p>
<p>(Signed.) "Ruiz y Capdepon.</p>
<p>"To the Governor-General of the Philippine Islands. </p>
<p>"Comply with and observe the above royal order and issue to the provincial 
chiefs the necessary orders thereunto pertaining.</p>
<p align="right">(Signed.) "Weyler."</p>
<p>As late as September 12, 1897, there was published by the Spanish Government 
a royal decree approving certain amendments to existing legislation in the 
Philippine Islands. Under section 4, title "Governmental Powers" (<em>Facultades 
Gubernativas</em>), article 30, No. 2, of said decree, there is a provision 
regarding deportation, reading as follows:</p>
<p>"To direct such deportations as may be deemed necessary for the preservation 
of public order, in accordance with the provisions of the Laws of the Indies, 
the enforcement of which was reminded by means of the Royal Order of August 
2,1888." (<em>Alcubilla's Diccionario de la Administracion Española</em>, 
Appendix for 1897, p. 455.)</p>
<p>All laws which are in force in a country or province conquered by or ceded to 
the United States and usually termed municipal law, other than laws political in 
character or laws inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United 
States or the characteristics and institutions of government, remain in force 
until by direct action of the Government of the United States they are altered 
or repealed. The basic decision is that of Mr. Chief Justice Marshall in 
American Insurance Co. <em>vs</em>. Canter (1828, 1 Pet, U. S., 511, 540, 543) 
in which it was decided as to Florida, ceded by Spain to the United States, as 
follows:</p>
<p>"The same act which transfers their country transfers the allegiance of those 
who remain in it; and <em>the law, which may be denominated political, is 
necessarily changed, although that which regulates the intercourse and general 
conduct of individuals, remains in force until altered by the newly created 
power of the state.</em></p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<p>"It has been already stated, that <em>all the laws which were in force in 
Florida, while a province of Spain, those excepted which were political in their 
character, which concerned the relations between the people and their sovereign, 
remained in force until altered by the Government of the United States</em>." 
(<em>See also</em> Roa <em>vs</em>. Collector of Customs, 1912, 23 Phil., 
315.)</p>
<p>We entertain little or no doubt that this royal order of Spain is a law, 
political in character, which did not continue in force in the Philippines after 
American occupation. This conclusion is self-evident when we come to go back and 
re- analyze the power of deportation of foreigners. As will be remembered 
expulsion is an arm of sovereignty which reaches out for reasons which to it are 
conclusive to send the foreigner out of the country. International relations, 
political necessity, or other causes of the same delicate character are the 
motives. The intercourse and general conduct of citizens are not involved. This 
power which Spain, a monarchy, saw fit to put in the hands of the representative 
of the Spanish Crown and which was intended for the protection of that sovereign 
could not by any means be considered as having continued under a republican 
government.</p>
<p>No law of Spain still in force in the Philippines authorizes the 
Governor-General to expel aliens.</p>
<p>5. We can assume, without deciding, that, under the authorities and the law, 
the Philippine^ Legislature would have power to enact a proper alien expulsion 
law. (Tiaco <em>vs</em>. Forbes, <em>supra</em>.) The cases have uniformly held 
that an act of the legislative authority of the Philippine Government which has 
not been expressly disapproved by Congress is valid unless its subject matter 
has been covered by Congressional legislation or its enactment forbidden by some 
provision of the organic laws. (Gaspar <em>vs</em>. Molina, 1905, 5 Phil., 197; 
U. S. <em>vs</em>. Bull, 1910, 15 Phil., 7.) The Jones Law and the Immigration 
Law of 1917 both permit the Philippine Legislature to take action relative to 
immigration of aliens with the approval of the President.</p>
<p>As far as we can find, section 69 of the Administrative Code alone 
constitutes action on this subject by the Philippine Legislature. It reads:</p>
<p>"A subject of a foreign power residing in the Philippine Islands shall not be 
deported, expelled; or excluded from said Islands or repatriated to his own 
country by the Governor-General except upon prior investigation, conducted by 
said Executive or his authorized agent, of the ground upon which such action is 
contemplated. In such case the person concerned shall be informed of the charge 
or charges against him and he shall be allowed not less than three days for the 
preparation of his defense. He shall also have the right to be heard by himself 
or counsel, to produce witnesses in his own behalf, and to cross-examine the 
opposing witnesses."</p>
<p>We know the antecedents of this section. It originated in a law hastily 
passed to uphold and protect the Governor- General. This first law only related 
to one case. Then followed Act No. 2113 enacted prior to the decision of the 
United States Supreme Court in Tiaco <em>vs</em>. Forbes on the assumption "that 
it has been decided that the Governor-General of the Philippine Islands has 
authority to deport, expel, exclude, or repatriate foreigners by due process of 
law," and that "there is no law at present in the Philippine Islands which 
determines or defines such process of law." The purpose then was, not to grant 
authority, which the Legislature assumed to exist, but to regulate authority. On 
the codification of the political laws, the Legislature naturally omitted the 
preamble to Act No. 2113 and merely continued with a slight change in 
phraseology the body of Act No. 2113 in the Administrative Codes of 1916 and 
1917. In enacting the Administrative Code the intention of the Legislature could 
have been no different, as far as we can know, than its intention as expressed 
when passing Act No. 2113. The report of the1 appropriate committee of the 
Legislature on this subject, although not conclusive, can be noticed by us in 
order to discover legislative intention. From this report it is plain that the 
Legislature, as heretofore said, was under the impression that the courts had 
decided that the Governor-General had the power to deport aliens and that all 
that was incumbent upon them was to fix the procedure. "An enactment of the 
Legislature based on an evident misconception of what the law is will not have 
the effect, <em>per se</em>, of changing the law so as to make it accord with 
the misconception." (Davis <em>vs</em>. Delpit, 1853, 25 Miss., 445. <em>See 
also</em> Van Norman <em>vs</em>. Jackson Circuit Judge, 1881, 45 Mich., 
204.)</p>
<p>The language of the section itself bears out this idea. The words are not a 
grant of power but in the negative are a regulation of a procedure. The 
Attorney-General, however, argues that section 69 having fixed the procedure, 
authority itself must be implied. "That which is plainly implied in the language 
of a statute is as much a part of it as that which is expressed." (Doyle 
<em>vs</em>. Doyle, 1893, 50 Ohio St., 330). Because of a lack of definition the 
power might be unlimited. Certainly, it would be illogical to have a law 
regulating how a thing shall be done without a law authorizing this thing to be 
done. Superfluities and absurdities in the law are to be avoided, if possible. 
The Attorney-General invites particular attention to the decision of the United 
States Supreme Court in U. S. vs. Midwest Oil Co., 1914, 236 U. S., 459. But in 
this case, the Act of Congress in question gave specific future authority to the 
President and the validity of what the President had previously done was 
inferred from long continued practice acquiesced in by Congress. Unlike this 
situation, we have here no act granting authority, and we have no long continued 
practice on the part of the Governor-General.</p>
<p>It would seem that section 69, predicated as it is on the unfortunate 
assumption that the Governor-General had the power to deport aliens, was merely 
enacted to safeguard public interests by providing for an investigation before 
deportation. Individual security, to follow the phraseology of Act No. 2113, was 
to be attained by defining and fixing process of law. This being the situation, 
the courts would not be warranted in laying on of the judicial hand on a simple, 
little procedural section and in making this section to live as substantive law. 
The sovereign power of deportation of aliens, the use of which without the 
exercise of great caution might endanger international comity, can not be 
presumed or implied from vague language, but must arise from direct and 
unequivocal authority.</p>
<p>Section 69 of the Administrative Code does not authorize the Governor-General 
to expel aliens.</p>
<p>6. The only remaining possibility is that the Governor-General has acted 
because of the existing war. Obviously this has been the occasion for action. 
Yet it has not been suggested by either petitioner or respondent that the war 
has given the Governor-General any unusual powers which he did not possess in 
time of peace excepting as regards alien enemies.</p>
<p>We conclude that the Governor-General of the Philippine Islands does not have 
the power to expel aliens therefrom.</p>
<p>A few words relative to the authorities and the opinion is complete. Three 
judges of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands in the case of Forbes vs. 
Chuoco Tiaco and Crossfield held that 'the Governor-General had the power to 
expel aliens. Two other judges concurred in the result but would not admit that 
the Governor-General had or has any power or authority to expel domiciled 
aliens. The United States Supreme Court affirmed this judgment, i. e., a 
judgment in which three judges believed the power existed and two believed that 
it did not. The view point of the United States Supreme Court is best understood 
by a quotation introducing the main question: <em>"Therefore, the deportation is 
to be considered as having been ordered by the Governor-General in pursuance of 
a statute of the Philippine Legislature directing it, under their combined 
powers, and it is unnecessary to consider whether he had authority, by virtue of 
his office alone, as declared by the statute, or whether, if he had not, he had 
immunity from suit for such an official act done in good faith."</em> Further on 
the court said: "It would be strange if a <em>government</em> so remote should 
be held bound to wait for the action of Congress in a matter that might touch 
its life unless dealt with at once and on the spot. On the contrary, we are of 
the opinion that <em>it had the power as an incident of the self-determination, 
however, limited, given to by the United States</em>" Again in summary it was 
said: "As the Bill of Rights did not stand in the way, and the implied powers of 
the government sanctioned by Congress permitted it, there is no reason why the 
<em>statute should not have full effect</em>" Otherwise stated, the prominent 
principles to be derived from this decision, are that the right to deport aliens 
exist in the Government of the Philippine Islands, and that the Governor-General 
having acted and the Legislature having confirmed said action, this was 
sufficient. In the case before us, however, we have present only half of this 
proposition; the Governor-General has acted but the Legislature has not 
supported his action. We think the decisions of the courts have not heretofore 
been conclusive but have left the question practically where it was before 
submission.</p>
<p>As to the other questions presented, there can be no doubt but what section 
69 of the Administrative Code is valid; no doubt but what the petitioner is "a 
subject of a foreign power," and no doubt but what due process of law was 
followed in the investigation and in the decision of the Governor-General. What 
has heretofore been said makes it futile to discuss these points.</p>
<p>On an exhaustive consideration of argument and authorities, and on a new 
investigation of the questions at issue, it has finally come to be my opinion 
that the Supreme Court has jurisdiction of this action, and that the 
Governor-General of the Philippine Islands is not authorized to expel aliens 
therefrom. Accordingly the petitioner should be released from custody.</p>
<p align="center">ADDENDUM.</p>
<p>The motion for reconsideration has furnished an opportunity for the majority 
to substitute an amended and enlarged decision for the original decision and for 
the minority to file two additional dissenting opinions. My dissenting opinion 
could well be revised for it was dictated under great pressure. I do not yield 
to the temptation to answer statements which seem to me untenable, or to insert 
additional authorities or arguments, or to polish rhetoric, for let it be said 
that what is now a dissenting opinion was submitted to the court prior to the 
other decisions as a memorandum, that the authorities and some of the language 
made use of in this memorandum will be found in the other decisions, and that to 
rewrite now would tend to transform the opinion into what I fear the other 
opinions are becoming (and I say this without malice) in the nature of briefs in 
which any corroborative authority or argument to fortify the conclusion is 
eagerly seized upon. Nothing has been said in the majority decision or on motion 
for reconsideration which would cause me to change my vote. My views concerning 
the effect of Act No. 2757 mentioned in the motion for reconsideration are
