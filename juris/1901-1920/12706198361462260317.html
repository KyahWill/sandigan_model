				<H3>DOMINGO FLORENTINO, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. JOSE CORTES ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.

				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Domingo Florentino brought the present action for the recovery of ownership of a parcel of land eight hundred meters long by four hundred&nbsp; meters wide, situated in the pueblo of Camalamingan, Cagayan de Luzon.&nbsp;&nbsp; The plaintiff alleged&nbsp; that when&nbsp; he&nbsp; desired&nbsp; to enter&nbsp; into the possession of the said property in&nbsp; the&nbsp; month of&nbsp; August, 1907, after purchasing the same,&nbsp; he could not do so&nbsp; because he was prevented by Jose Cortes and Felipe Tuzon who were holding the land; and&nbsp; in&nbsp; his&nbsp; brief he requested the Court of First Instance to sentence the defendants to deliver&nbsp; to him the land he claimed, to pay him Pl,000 for loss and damages,&nbsp; and the costs.<br><br>To prove his ownership, the plaintiff presented a private instrument executed, as it appears, on July 1, 1907, wherein record is made of&nbsp; a sale to him, by Josef a&nbsp; de Guzman, of a parcel of&nbsp; land described in the said instrument.&nbsp; Oral testimony&nbsp; was adduced&nbsp; by both sides, and the court concluded its&nbsp; judgment as&nbsp; follows:<br><blockquote>"Neither does it appear from the&nbsp; evidence,&nbsp; to the satisfaction of the&nbsp; court, that the&nbsp; <i>negrita&nbsp;</i> (the said Josef a de Guzman) occupied the land for a period of ten years prior to&nbsp; July 26, 1904,&nbsp; with all the&nbsp; requisites prescribed by the Public Land Act, and inasmuch&nbsp; as, in an action for the recovery of possession,&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff must base his claim on the legality of his own right rather than&nbsp; on the deficiency of the defendant's title,&nbsp; the court is of the opinion that the plaintiff has not demonstrated, by a preponderance of&nbsp; evidence, that&nbsp; he possesses&nbsp; a better right than the defendant to the land in controversy.<br><br>"The plaintiff in this case, Domingo Florentino, can not have a better right to the land&nbsp; in question than that which the <i>negrita</i>, Josefa de Guzman, could have transmitted to him.&nbsp;&nbsp; * *&nbsp; *<br><br>"Moreover, the&nbsp; court has carefully observed the conduct of the&nbsp; plaintiff's witnesses&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; and is of the opinion that their statements should be received with the greatest caution; and, therefore,&nbsp; notwithstanding the fact that the witnesses for the plaintiff were more numerous than those for the defendants,&nbsp; the&nbsp; weight and quality&nbsp; of&nbsp; the oral evidence is in&nbsp; favor of the said defendants.<br><br>"Therefore,&nbsp; the&nbsp; court renders judgment for the defendants, Jose Cortes and Felipe Tuzon, and against the plaintiff, Domingo&nbsp; Florentino, and&nbsp; sentences the said plaintiff to the&nbsp; payment of the costs."<br></blockquote>The&nbsp; plaintiff appealed&nbsp; and, in the bill of exceptions forwarded to this&nbsp; court, alleged three assignments of error:<br><ol type="1"><li>Because the defendants were not declared to be&nbsp; in default;<br><br></li><li>Because it&nbsp; was not held that Josefa de Guzman was the owner of the land purchased from her;<br><br></li><li>Because that part&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; land&nbsp; illegally occupied by the defendants, and a reasonable sum as an indemnity for losses and damages, were not awarded to the plaintiff.</li></ol>With regard to the first assignment, the trial court exercised its discretion and did&nbsp; not&nbsp; err.<br><br>With respect&nbsp; to the second and&nbsp; third assignments, the Supreme Court can not, without reason, make any findings contrary to those set forth&nbsp; in the judgment of the lower court and the weight of the&nbsp; evidence considered by it.<br><br>There is one thing which must be clearly laid down by this court:<br><br>The&nbsp; rejection&nbsp; of the claim of ownership for lack of title, and of that of possession for lack of proof, in the judgment of the lower court, of the&nbsp; claim that such possession was held ten years&nbsp; prior to July 26,&nbsp; 1904, by the grantor, Josefa&nbsp; Guzman, are&nbsp; held by this court to be&nbsp; in accordance with law.<br><br>The&nbsp; doctrine set up in the judgment of the lower court, that an action&nbsp; for&nbsp; the recovery of possession must be founded on&nbsp; positive titles on the part of the plaintiff and not merely&nbsp; on&nbsp; negative&nbsp; ones, or the lack or insufficiency of title on the part of the defendant, is correct and in accord with the&nbsp; principles of law.&nbsp; Such&nbsp; an action&nbsp; prosecuted between two persons can not operate to the&nbsp; prejudice of the real owner&nbsp; who is not&nbsp; a party,&nbsp; whether he be&nbsp; some other private person, or the State, or the Insular&nbsp; Government, as is apparently the case&nbsp; in the present suit.<br><br>In affirming the judgment appealed from, properly disallowing the plaintiff's claim, it is&nbsp; not the&nbsp; sense of this court to concede true&nbsp; and legitimate right of possession on the part of the&nbsp; defendants.&nbsp; Our affirmance is limited to the act of possessing.<br><br>The&nbsp; judgment appealed from&nbsp; is affirmed, with the costs against the appellant.<br><br><i>Mapa, Carson, Moreland,</i>&nbsp; and <i>Trent, JJ.</i>, concur.<br></div>
