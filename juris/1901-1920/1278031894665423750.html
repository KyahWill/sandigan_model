				G.R. No. 13316, December 11, 1917</h4>
				<H3>L. J. MADARANG ET AL., PETITIONERS, VS. FRANCISCO SANTAMARIA, JUDGE OF FIRST INSTANCE OF ILOCOS SUR, AND DIONISIO ABAYA ET AL., RESPONDENTS.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This was an original action commenced in the Supreme Court. It was entitled 
"United States, petitioner, <em>vs</em>. The Court of First Instance et al., 
respondents." It was a civil action and should not have been entitled as thus 
indicated. From a reading of the petition, however, it appears that it was an 
action by the said Madarang et al. <em>vs</em>. The Judge of the Court of First 
Instance et al. It was an original action for the writ of injunction. The prayer 
was, first, for a preliminary injunction, and second, for a perpetual 
injunction. The prayer of the petition is as follows:
<p>"For the aforementioned considerations, the petitioner prays that this 
Supreme Court issue a writ of preliminary injunction against the respondents and 
that after the necessary legal proceedings it render decision against them, 
issuing a perpetual injunction for the same purpose, and staying the respondents 
from disturbing the rights and properties involved in these proceedings, 
sentencing them besides to pay the amount of P40,000 as damages, and the costs 
of these proceedings."</p>
<p>We have frequently held, in accordance with the provisions of section 17 of 
Act No. 136, that the Supreme Court does not have original jurisdiction, in an 
action brought for that purpose, to grant a remedy by injunction. Said section 
provides that the Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction to issue writs 
of mandamus, certiorari, prohibition, habeas corpus, and quo warranto. No 
provision is made for the granting of the writ of injunction as an original 
action in the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>An application for a preliminary injunction will be denied by the Supreme 
Court unless the same is petitioned for in connection with some other remedy or 
in an action actually pending in that court. (Diokno <em>vs</em>. Reyes, 7 Phil. 
Rep., 385; Garcia Gavieres <em>vs</em>. Robinson, 8 Phil. Rep., 332; 
International Banking Corporation <em>vs</em>. De Leon, R. G. No. 2843, Nov. 15, 
1905, not published.)</p>
<p>For the foregoing reasons, therefore, the petition is hereby denied, with 
costs. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C J., Torres, Carson, Araullo, Street, Malcolm,</em> and 
<em>Avancena JJ.</em>, concur.</p></div>
