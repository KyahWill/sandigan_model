				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>An application was made on the 24th day of June, 1903, to the judge of the Court of First  Instance  of the Sixth Judicial District, by Placido Banayo, for a writ of habeas corpus, the petitioner alleging that he was deprived of his liberty and imprisoned by Marcos Paulino, municipal president of San Pablo, Province of Laguna, in the public prison of the said municipality;  that he was so placed in confinement  about  the  80th  day of May,  1903,  in  the municipal prison, without then being informed of the cause of his detention;  that  two or three days  afterwards he was given over to the justice of the peace on an accusation of <em>estafa</em>, which olfense, as alleged against him, consisted in the fact that he had refused to pay the wages of one of his servants; that the justice of  the peace, as soon as he heard the facts of the case, discharged the petitioner from further prosecution; that  notwithstanding this  fact,  the municipal president, Marcos  Paulino,  again caused  him to be  imprisoned in the municipal prison, where he is now hold without any order of competent authority; that there existed neither complaint nor information, or other formal allegations.</p>
<p>The writ of habeas  corpus was  issued  in  accordance with the prayer of the  petitioner.  The respondent made return to the writ, and for cause of the  detention presented a copy of  a decision  rendered by  the  municipal council of San Pablo on the Oth day of June, 1903, which sot  forth that Placido Banayo bad been arrested for the crime of <em>estafa</em> on the  complaint of Julian Arellano and by the teniente of the barrio  of San Francisco, Don Mamerto Evangelista, as a  disturber of the peace of the inhabitants; that, with  respect to the first-named offense, it was admitted that the justice of the peace alone had jurisdiction to investigate the  matter; that  as  to  the second offense, that of disturbance of the public peace, such act is an administrative offense (<em>delito administrativo</em>) ; that the investigation  being had by way of administrative  complaint, as a result it was proven that the disturbance of the public  order was committed by the accused in the barrio mentioned, and that thereupon the president and municipal council, under their powers to correct acts which  tend to the  disturbance of the peace of the inhabitants, after declaring the acts to be dangerous to the tranquillity of the town, sentenced the accused, Placido Banayo, to the  penalty of one hundred and sixty-eight days of imprisonment and  a fine of $199.   It will not be necessary here to consider the character of the acts upon which the complaint for  disturbance of the peace is based.  It is sufficient to say that they appear to have been quite frivolous,  and consist in the accused having incited various persons  who had  been excluded from participation in the division  of an estate to litigate  concerning the opening of the estate of Juan Banayo,  deceased, the grandfather of the defendant,  and in which estate the defendant himself was interested ; and in the accused having cut the coeoanut trees on the estate.</p>
<p>The cause was heard on the 22d day of July, 1903, by the Court of First Instance and the petitioner was remanded to the custody of  the respondent;  the costs of the proceeding were adjudged against the petitioner.   From this judgment of the  Court  of First  Instance the petitioner has appealed to this court.</p>
<p>The decision of  the Court of First Instance is apparently based upon  the construction given to section 528  of the Code of Civil Procedure of 1901,  which provides that the writ of habeas corpus shall not be allowed when it appears that the person alleged to be deprived of his liberty is in the custody of an officer under process issued by a court or magistrate, or held by virtue of a judgment or order  of a court of record having jurisdiction.  It was the opinion of the judge of the Court of First Instance that the municipal council of San Pablo was acting within its jurisdiction, and that, the defendant being held by virtue of an order of the municipal council,  the court  could not inquire  into the  sufficiency of  the complaint as to  vices or defects of the proceedings, or as to whether the judgment or sentence was erroneous or not, the remedy  of the defendant being by appeal.</p>
<p>Under Act No. 82, which is a general act for the organization of municipal governments in the Philippine Islands, the powers vested in the municipal governments are subdivided, that part  of an  executive and judicial  character being vested in the president, and that part of a legislative character  being vested in  the  municipal council.  The president is made the chief executive of the  municipality, and,  by section 18 (g), he is empowered to hold a court to hear and adjudge alleged violations of public ordinances, upon complaint filed by his direction or by a police officer, or  a  private citizen, and  after due trial, in which the accused and his witnesses shall be heard, shall, upon conviction,  impose such punishment, either by admonition or by fine and imprisonment, or both, in his discretion, as is provided for in section 39 (<em>dd</em>) of the act.   To the municipal council is delegated legislative power alone. It possesses no powers whatever of a judicial character.  Nor is there any  such proceeding known in our present laws as . <em>delito gubernativo</em>.</p>
<p>The power of the municipal  council being dependent upon the municipal act, and, as stated, no judicial power having been delegated to the municipal council, the exercise of any such power by it is without authority,  and it had no  jurisdiction to render the judgment or make the order under which the petitioner is held.  The proceeding before the municipal council was an absolute nullity, and  the detention or imprisonment of  the  petitioner under these void proceedings was illegal and  wrongful, and the Court of First Instance erred in not directing his discharge from custody.</p>
<p>For the reasons above stated, the judgment of the Court of First Instance is reversed, and  judgment is here rendered directing  that the petitioner be discharged  from custody, and that the costs of these proceedings be adjudged against the respondent, Marcos Paulino.</p>
<p><em> Arellano, C. J., Torres, Willard, Mapa,</em> and <em>McDonough, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
