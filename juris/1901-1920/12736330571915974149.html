				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The purpose of this action was to recover a parcel of land, as joint owners. 
The land is particularly described in paragraph 2 of the complaint. The action 
was commenced in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Oriental Negros 
on the 24th day of July, 1915. Issue was joined and a trial was had; after which 
the Honorable W. E. McMahon, in a carefully prepared opinion, decided that the 
land in question belonged to Jose G. de la Peña, absolved the defendant from 
all liability under the complaint, and ordered the plaintiffs as well as the 
defendant Trinidad Tamarra not to interfere with his possession, with costs 
against Trinidad Tamarra. From that judgment the plaintiffs appealed.
<p>The judgment was rendered upon the 17th day of January, 1916. On the 21st day 
of January, 1916, the plaintiffs excepted to said judgment and presented a 
motion for a new trial, which motion was denied on the 22d day of January, 1916, 
and notice was given to the attorney of the appellants on the same day. On the 
25th day of January, 1916, the appellants gave notice of their intention to 
present a bill of exceptions. The bill of exceptions, however, was not presented 
until the 15th day of February, 1916, it appearing from the record that the bill 
of exceptions was not presented in the time prescribed by law, and that, 
therefore, this court acquired no jurisdiction by the appeal. (Layda 
<em>vs</em>. Legazpi, p.. 83, ante; Anderson <em>vs</em>. Green, R. G. No. 
13152<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> [not published] ; Yap Quinco 
<em>vs</em>. Papa, R. G. No. 13359<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 
[not published] ; Rivera <em>vs</em>. Manalansan, R. G. No. 13586<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> [not published]; Asistio Daguindal de 
Jesus <em>vs</em>. Mariano Velasco &amp; Co., and Mitchel, R. G. No. 13860<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> [not published]; Garcia <em>vs</em>. Vito 
and Alulong, R. G. No. 14399<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> [not 
published]; Lim <em>vs</em>. Singian and Soler, 37 Phil. Rep.. 817; Lituana and 
Calica <em>vs</em>. Oliveros, 38 Phil. Rep., 628.) </p>
<p>Therefore, the bill of exceptions not having been presented in the time 
prescribed by law, and the time for presentation of the same not having been 
extended before its expiration, we are without jurisdiction to entertain the 
appeal, and the bill of exceptions is, therefore, dismissed. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Street, Malcolm, Avanceña</em>, and <em>Moir, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p>
