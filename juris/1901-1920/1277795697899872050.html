				G.R. No. 12846, November 12, 1917</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. THE NEGRITO MEYMAY, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The record before us discloses a typical headhunting expedition of the 
primitive Negritos. According to one account, the wife of the Negrito Arturo, 
with others living in the macheria having been murdered, and according to 
another account, the Negritos by order of one Butong, having been directed to 
kill the enemies of Butong, in a band of seven or eight, they proceeded to the 
banks of the Pincanauan River, where about twenty persons were fishing. Without 
warning, the Negritos attacked the unsuspecting people killing six Christians, 
Domingo Pagulayan, Saturnino Calaputoc, Vicente Cauan, Rosenda Malillin, 
Hermogena Buraga, and Eufrasia Bernaga.
<p>The evidence is sufficient to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that the 
defendant and appellant, the Negrito Meymay, accepted an invitation to join a 
band intent on murderous reprisal, and that he took an active part in the 
commission of the crime which resulted in the horrible death of six innocent 
persons. The lower court very properly took into consideration the qualifying 
circumstance of alevosia, and the aggravating circumstance that the crime was 
committed in an uninhabited place by a band of more than three armed men, but 
compensated by the mitigating circumstance of lack of education- provided by Act 
No. 2142.</p>
<p>The judgment of the lower court sentencing the Negrito Meymay to the penalty 
of <em>cadena perpetua</em>, with the accessory penalties provided by law, to 
pay jointly and severally with his companions, who were convicted in case No. 
1006 to the heirs of the deceased the amount of P500, and to pay the costs, is 
affirmed with the costs of,this instance against the appellant. So ordered.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson, Carson, Araullo</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Street, JJ.,</span>
