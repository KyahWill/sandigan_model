				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On the 25th of September, 1901, the plaintiff leased  to the defendant Dy-Jia, and to one Dy-Guico, a tract of land in the city of Manila for  five years from the 1st day  of October, 1901, the  lease terminating on the 30th day  of September, 1900.   Clause E of that contract is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"E.  Los arrendatarios bajo ningun pretexto no podran subarrendar la finca de que se trata ni hipotecar los edificios que se construyan, y si lo contrario hicieren quedara rescindido el presente contrato como si hubiesen  transcurrido los einco anos estipulados,  quedando en beneficio del solar todas las edificaciones construidas en  el."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The lessees entered into possession of the tract of land and erected thereon a building at  a cost of  about 11,000 pesos.   The defendant Li Tsung Ling, sued under the name of Dy-Chuanding,  alleged  in his answer that the lessees, Dy-Jia and Dy-Guico, were merely agents of his in making this lease and  constructing the building and that he was the real owner of the leasehold interest and of the said building.   On the 31st of December, 1902, Dy-Guico signed a written statement in which he declared that the building belonged to the said defendant,  Li Tsung Ling, and that the latter should pay the  rent due under the lease to the plaintiff.  On the 18th  of May, 1903,  Dy-Jia  made  a similar  declaration in writing and assigned and transferred to the  defendant Li Tsung Ling all  his interest in the lot rented as aforesaid from the plaintiff.  The defendant  Li Tsung Ling  paid  the  rent to the  plaintiff  from November, 1902, until January, 1904.  The receipts which the plaintiff gave for this rent were made out in the name of Dy-Jia and Dy-Guico.   It is claimed by the defendant that the plaintiff knew during this time that all the interest in the lease had been transferred by the lessees to him.  That is denied by the plaintiff.   We do not find it  necessary, however, to decide this question  of fact.   On the 8th of January, 1904, the lawyer  for the  defendant  Li Tsung Ling wrote a letter to the plaintiff in regard to the rent due for the month of January, in which letter he stated that the lessees were the agents of his client, the defendant Li Tsung  Ling.  The plaintiff testified  that  at once upon receipt of this letter he made  investigations and learned, as he says, for the first time that the interest of the lessees had, in November, 1902, been transferred to the defendant Li Tsung Ling in violation, as he claims, of clause E above quoted  from the  contract of lease.  On the  10th  day of January, 1904, the defendant Li  Tsung Ling paid to the plaintiff and the plaintiff  received from him  the rent for the month of January, and the plaintiff then gave a receipt, of which the following is a copy:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Recibi de Dy-Jia  y Dy-Guico  la cantidad de ciento y. diez  pesos, conant importe del alquiler del  terreno en las calles de Poblete y Claverfa que ocupa, correspondiente al presente mes.</p>
  <p>"Manila, 1.° de  Enero de 1904.</p>
    <p align="right">(Firmado)  "D. CORTES.</p>
    <p>"Son P110."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Six days after—that is to say, on the 16th day of January—the plaintiff brought this action, asking  that  the contract of lease be rescinded as of the 12th of November, l902, and that the be declared the owner of the buildings that  had  been constructed  upon  the  property therein mentioned.</p>
<p>Judgment was rendered in the court  below in favor of the plaintiff; the defendant Li Tsung Ling moved for a new trial on the ground that the findings of fact were not justified by  the  evidence, and that motion  having been denied, he has brought the case here by  bill of exceptions.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the provisions of clause E of the contract of lease, a valid assignment could be made  by the lessees  of  their interest therein with the consent  of the lessor.  That consent  need not be express.   Any act performed by the lessor which  indicated that he recognized the relation  of landlord and tenant as existing between himself and  the assignee of  the lessees  would amount to such consent.  Such an act, we think, was performed  by the plaintiff  in this case when he received the rent for the month of January from the assignee.   That at the time he received this rent he  knew of the assignment, is  established both by the terms of the receipt which he gave on the 10th day of January and by his own evidence in the case. By that act he clearly recognized the assignee as his tenant of the property for the  month of January, and thereby gave his consent to the assignment  which had been made  by the lessees to this defendant.  After that act of recognition he could not insist upon the forfeiture of the lease for a violation of the provisions of said clause E.</p>
<p>The defendant Li Tsung Ling has alleged in his answer a counterclaim and he asks that the contract of lease  be reformed by  striking therefrom clause D, which provides for the removal at the  termination of  the  lease of any buildings which may be erected upon the leased property, and substituting in place thereof another clause requiring the plaintiff  at the expiration of the  lease to  pay the defendant  the reasonable value of the  buildings erected thereon or to extend the term of  the lease.   There  is no merit in this counterclaim.</p>
<p>The  judgment of the  court below is  reversed  and the defendant Li Tsung Ling is absolved from the complaint, with costs of the first instance.  No costs will be allowed to either party in this court.  After the expiration of twenty days let judgment be entered in accordance herewith and ten days thereafter the record remanded to the court from whence it came for proper action.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres</em> and <em>Carson, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em>Tracey, J.,</em> concurs in  the result.<br>
