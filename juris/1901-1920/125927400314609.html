				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Appeal by  the defendants  Lucio  Barbasa  and Teodoro Luna from the judgment  of  the 24th of December,  1897, rendered in case No. 6614 by the  Court  of Intramuros (Manila), by which the defendants  were convicted of falsification of cedula,  and each one  of them  sentenced to four months and one day  of <em>arresto mayor</em>, and a fine of 325 pesetas, with  accessories.  Lucio Barbasa,  for  each one of the two offenses of  falsification of certificates, was convicted and condemned  to two years and one  day of <em>suspension</em> and a fine of 325 pesetas, and, in case of insolvency, to the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment, and Teodoro Luna, for each one of  the two crimes,  to the penalty of one month and  one day of <em>arresto  mayor</em>,  with accessories, and each to the payment of one-sixth part of the  costs, one-half of the  provisional imprisonment suffered to be deducted  from the  term of imprisonment  to which they were sentenced.  Tomas Acosta  and Ignacio Jacobo  were acquitted of  the charge of  falsification  of cedula and falsification of .certificates, and the said Acosta and  Jacobo and the said  Lucio Barbasa and Teodoro Luna were acquitted  of the charge of falsification of a certificate of baptism by reason of lack of evidence of their participation  in the said crime, with the remainder of  the costs <em>de oficio</em>.</p>
<p>Julio Lagrimas del Rosario made certain arrangements with one Catalino Gaza by which the latter was to  act as his substitute in  the  military service under the  Spanish Government.  Gaza received from Lagrimas a certain  sum of money through the agency of Tomas Acosta, a  sergeant of the engineer corps which the substitute was to  join. Acosta undertook  to prepare the necessary  documents, consisting of the certificate of baptism of Julio Lagrimas, the  cedula of  the  latter,  and two certificates issued  by Lucio Barbasa as  <em>gobernadorcillo</em> of Ermita, with two attesting witnesses,  Miguel Abalos  and  Teodoro Luna. The result of the investigation shows that the certificate of baptism was altered by erasing the year of birth and by writing over this erasure "1864" in place of "1874," which was the year originally entered on the certificate; that the personal cedula of Julio Lagrimas, issued on July 4, 1894, by the said <em>gobernadorcillo,</em> Lucio Barbasa, and the caheza de barangay, Miguel Abalos, stated that Lagrimas was 30 years of age and was a resident of Ermita, the fact being that he was only 20 years, of age and was a  resident of Santa Cruz; that in the certificate of July  10, 1894, by the said gobernadorcillo, Barbasa, and the attesting witnesses, Abalos and Luna, it was stated that Lagrimas, whose name was registered  in the district under the charge of Abalos, was free from forced military service for that year, the fact being that he was included in the list  of conscripts of the district of Santa Cruz; and that in another certificate of the same date, issued by the same gobernadoroillo and witnesses, it was recited that Eleuterio Lagrimas, the father of the substitute Julio, had given his consent to the enlistment of the latter, the certificate purporting to bear the signature of Eleuterio, who, in fact, was unable to write, and  who denies having given such consent.</p>
<p>From the facts related it follows that the crime of falsification of a public document has been committed, inasmuch as a certificate of  baptism  is of a public or official character, this  crime being defined and punished in article 301, in connection with article 300 of the Penal Code.</p>
<p>The facts also show the  commission of  another crime, consisting in the falsification of  a personal cedula,  punished by  article 307 of  the same Code, as well as the commission of  two crimes of falsification  of certificates, defined and punished  by article 310 of the Code.</p>
<p>Tomas Acosta, the only person liable for the  falsification  of the certificate of baptism of Julio Lagrimas, being absent, it is not necessary for the court to deal with the question of his guilt in the commission of this crime.</p>
<p>For the same reason, owing to the absence  of Miguel Abalos, the <em>cabeza de  barangay</em> who  issued the false personal cedula in favor of the said Julio Lagrimas, making it appear falsely that the latter was registered in his office, the question of his guilt is not before us.  Nor can we hold that the <em>gobernadorcillo</em> of Ermita,  Lucio Barbasa,  participated in this falsification  of  cedula, inasmuch as his signature was simply appended for the purpose of attesting that the cedula was issued, as it was in  fact, by the <em>cabeza de  barangay</em>, upon whom alone rests the responsibility for the validity and the authenticity of the cedula issued.</p>
<p>With respect to  the two crimes of falsification of certificates, and in view  of the absence  of Miguel Abalos, one of the attesting witnesses who signed them, the only persons who can now  be held  responsible for their participation in the commission of  the  crime  are  the <em>gobernadorcillo</em>, Lucio Barbasa, and the other attesting witness, Teodoro Luna,  as, notwithstanding the exculpative allegations of the <em>gobernadorcillo,</em> Barbasa, the fact is that he, acting in his capacity as a local  authority,  together with the attesting witnesses, issued and signed these certificates, under his name and  official title.  Hence, the attesting witness Teodoro Luna and  the <em>gobernadorcillo </em>who signed  the certificates are responsible for the falsification committed by the mere fact of having certified to the truth of statements therein  contained, it being  unquestionable that  Barbasa performed these  acts in the exercise of his official duties,  the documents having been sealed with the  seal of the  municipal court of Ermita, and consequently  having, under the administrative laws, an official character, the offense being  specifically  punished by article 310 of the Code.  However, the responsibility of Teodoro Luna, as a mere attesting witness, and  therefore a mere private individual, and not in the exercise  of any public,  permanent office,  falls within the provisions of article 311 of Code.</p>
<p>It the commission of the two  crimes above mentioned, we  are of the opinion that the especial circumstance of article. 11  of  the Code should be applied, in  view of the character of the crimes prosecuted and the personal conditions of the accused,  there being no aggravating circumstance to offset the effect of this article.   Therefore,  by virtue of section 50 of General Orders, No. 58, and without passing upon those parts of the judgment of  the  court below  against which no appeal has been taken,  we are of the  opinion that for each one of the two crimes of falsification of certificates the former <em>gobernadorcillo</em> of  Ermita, Lucio  Barbasa, should be  sentenced to two years and one day of <em>suspension </em>from public office, the right of suffrage, the exercise of any trade or profession, and to a fine of 700 pesetas,  and, in case of insolvency,  to the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment, and to the payment of one-sixth part of the costs in both instances, and Teodoro Luna to one month and fifteen days of <em>arresto mayor</em>, with the  accessories of another sixth part of the  costs  in both instances;  and that the said Barbasa and  Luna be  acquitted of the charge  of falsification  of  cedula, with two-sixths  parts of the costs <em>de oficio,</em> the judgment below  to be affirmed in so far as it is in conformity with this opinion and reversed in so far as it is in conflict therewith.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C.J., Cooper,  Willard,</em> and <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em>Mapa, J.,</em> did not sit in this case.</p>
