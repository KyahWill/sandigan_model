				<BR><STRONG>AVANCEÃ‘A, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The information upon which this case brought is literally as follows:
<blockquote><p>"The undersigned fiscal accuses Nicomedes Gumban of the crime of assault upon 
agents of authority committed as follows:</p>
<p>"That on or about August 13, 1917, in the municipality of Jaro, Province of 
Iloilo, P. I., the said accused did then and there, willfully, unlawfully, and 
criminally, attack, employ force, and lay hands upon the person of Petronilo 
Gumban, municipal president of the said municipality of Jaro, and therefore upon 
the person of an agent of authority of the said municipality, at a time when 
said Petronilo Gumban was engaged in the performance of his official duties, 
giving said Petronilo Gumban a slap on the face. Committed in violation of 
article 250 of the Penal Code."</p></blockquote>
<p>On the morning of August 13, 1917, Petronilo Gumban, municipal president of 
Jaro, Iloilo, was in the barrio of Pavia of the said municipality, inspecting 
the quarantine of animals. He was getting some information from a councilor, 
Magdaleno Suliano, regarding the condition of the animals in his barrio, when 
Gregorio Ismaiia, a tenant of Magdaleno Suliano, arrived to report the fact that 
he had surprised a carabao belonging to Policarpio Gumban, destroying a planted 
area belonging to the said Magdaleno Suliano, and that, having seized the 
carabao, he brought the same to the police station at Pavia, which is within the 
zone affected by the quarantine. Then Epifanio Gumban and the accused Nicomedes 
Gumban, brothers of Policarpio Gumban, the owner of the carabao, arrived there 
and protested to the president that their brother's carabao was taken to Pavia 
which is within the zone affected by the quarantine. The president, upon hearing 
said protest, said that it was his opinion that Gregorio Ismana was right in 
taking the carabao to the police station at Pavia. However he promised to 
intervene in the matter and to telephone to the man in charge of the quarantine 
to find out whether, on the following day, the said carabao could not be 
withdrawn from the zone affected by the quarantine. Upon hearing this statement 
of the president, the accused insulted the said president and gave him a slap on 
the face which struck his left ear.</p>
<p>The lower court found the defendant guilty of the crime of assault <span style="font-style: italic;">upon an 
agent of authority</span>, and sentenced him to 3 years, 4 months, and 8 days of 
<span style="font-style: italic;">prision correccional</span>, to pay a fine of P600, Philippine currency, with the 
corresponding subsidiary imprisonment, in case of insolvency, and to pay the 
costs. From this judgment the defendant appealed.</p>
<p>However, the facts proved at the trial constitute the crime of assault with 
the hands upon a person in authority as defined in paragraph 2 of article 249 in 
connection with paragraph 3 of article 250 of the Penal Code. Article 249 
says:</p>
<blockquote><p>"The offense of assault (<span style="font-style: italic;">atentado</span>) is committed by:</p>
<p>"1. * * * * * * *</p>
<p>"2. Any person who shall attack, employ force against, or seriously resist or 
intimidate, any person in authority, or the agents of such person, while engaged 
in the performance of his official duties, or by reason of such 
performance."</p></blockquote>
<p>Article 250 says:</p>
<blockquote><p>""The penalty for assaults falling within the next preceding article shall be 
* * * when the offense is committed under any of the following circumstances : 
</p>
<p>"1. * * * * * * *</p>
<p>"2 * * * * * * *</p>
<p>"3. When the offenders lay hands upon any person in authority."</p></blockquote>
<p>According to the above provisions of law, in order that the crime of assault 
punishable by these articles may exist, it is sufficient that there be an 
assault upon a person in authority committed by laying hands upon him. The 
supreme court of Spain in a decision under date December 7, 1876, held:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Considering that the fact of giving a slap to a person in authority should 
necessarily be qualified in the sense of <span style="font-style: italic;">laying hands upon the same person</span> and 
that the court has not thus erred in applying articles 263 and 264, paragraph 3 
(articles 249 and 250, paragraph 3 of the Penal Code of the Philippines) to the 
defendant who gave a slap to the person of the municipal judge of Canada when 
the latter was engaged in the performance of the duties pertaining to his 
office, etc."</p></blockquote>
<p>According to the doctrine above set forth, the facts proved in this case 
involve all the necessary elements that constitute the crime of assault, 
inasmuch as the offended party, being a municipal president, was a person in 
authority (U. S. <em>vs</em>. Dirain, 4 Phil. Rep., 541), and was in the 
performance of hia official duties. In reaching this conclusion, we took into 
account the decision rendered by this court in the case against Gelacio Tabiana 
and Canillas,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> in which it is said that 
the distinction between an assault and a resistance to agents of authority lies 
largely in the amount of the force employed in each case, and that a sudden blow 
given to a policeman while engaged in effecting an arrest does not constitute 
that employment of force which is punishable as assault. We have also considered 
the decision rendered by this court in the case against Cipriano Agustin (R. G. 
No. 13083 [decided December 11, 1917, not published]) in which it was also held 
that a blow upon a policeman was not an aggression amounting to an assault. It 
must be remembered, however, that in these two cases the crime involved was that 
of assault upon agents of authority, in which the essential element is 
substantially the force employed. It is said in these two cases that any force 
is not sufficient to constitute an assault, but that it is necessary to consider 
the circumstances of each case to decide whether the force used is, or is not, 
sufficient to constitute assault upon an agent of authority. In the present 
case, the crime involved is that of assault upon a person in authority, in which 
the force necessary to constitute this crime is specifically defined by the law 
and consists in laying hands upon the person. In this case, it is not necessary 
to ascertain what force the law requires in order to constitute an assault, 
since the law itself defines concretely this force in providing that it consists 
in laying hands upon the person. The law simply mentions the laying of hands, 
without making any distinction as to the different cases, and it would not be 
just to make that distinction when the law does not make it. It is to be noted 
that the same provision of the law with regard to intimidation or resistance as 
other constitutive elements of assault expressly requires that they be serious. 
If the law had intended to distinguish between the case of a serious laying of 
hands and that which is not serious, it would have laid down that distinction. 
This seems to indicate that the distinction which the law makes in the cases of 
intimidation or resistance is not intended to be applied to the case of laying 
hands.</p>
<p>The information qualifies the crime charged as an assault upon an agent of 
authority. Inasmuch as the offended party, as municipal president, is a person 
in authority and not a mere agent of authority, the designation of the crime 
given by the fiscal is erroneous. But, as has been decided by this court in many 
cases, this mistake does not affect the information, because the qualification 
which the fiscal makes is not what constitutes the crime but the facts stated in 
the information. In relating the facts constituting the alleged crime, the 
fiscal further says that the offended party was a municipal president and 
<span style="font-style: italic;">therefore an agent of authority</span>. This, however, is nothing but a mere conclusion 
of law which can be considered discarded from the information. The allegation 
made that the offended party was a municipal president is sufficient to make one 
understand that the crime charged in the information is that of assault upon a 
person in authority. For this reason, we believe that, in accordance with the 
information filed in this case, the accused can be found guilty of the crime of 
assault upon a person in authority.</p>
<p>In accordance with the recommendation of the Attorney-General, we hereby 
declare the defendant guilty of the crime of assault upon a person in authority 
in accordance with article 249, paragraph 2, in connection with article 250, 
paragraph 3 of the Penal Code, and, modifying the judgment appealed from, we 
hereby sentence the accused to the penalty of 4 years, 2 months, and 1 day of 
<span style="font-style: italic;">prision correccional</span>, to pay a fine of 625 pesetas, or to suffer the 
corresponding subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the 
costs.</p>
<p>In view, however, of the special circumstances of the case and of the degree 
of malice and the damage caused, which may be deducted therefrom, we believe 
that the penalty imposed, by reason of the strict application of the provisions 
above cited, is evidently excessive, and, in accordance with article 2 of the 
Penal Code, it is hereby submitted and recommended to His Excellency, the 
Governor-General, to grant the accused a partial pardon by reducing the penalty 
to 10 months of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correccional</span>. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Johnson, Street,</em> and <em>Fisher, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>

<p align="center"><em><strong>DISSENTING OPINION</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>MALCOLM, J.</strong>, <em>dissenting:</em></p>
<p>My views can best be presented by retrogressive elimination :</p>
<p>1. Should a person who slaps a municipal president be found guilty of a 
violation of articles 249 and 250 of the Penal Code because he laid hands on a 
person in authority, and sentenced therefor to four years, two months and one 
day of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correccional</span>, to pay a fine of 625 pesetas, with subsidiary 
imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the costs of both instances all 
as recommended by the Solicitor-General and agreed to by a majority of this 
court?</p>
<p>The information by means of which the charge was initiated, under which the 
accused was arraigned, and regarding which the judge of first instance in his 
decision was in no doubt, charged the accused only with assaulting an agent of 
an authority.</p>
<p>Certainly, we should not now strain the language of the information to 
include what it was not intended to include, simply to furnish a means by which 
this offender can be severely punished.</p>
<p>2. Is the accused guilty of a violation of articles 249 and 250 of the Penal 
Code or of the lesser offense penalized by article 252? The doctrine announced 
in The United States vs. Tabiana and Canillas ([1918], 37 Phil. Rep., 515) is 
entirely applicable. Even if. it were not, in view of the entirely unjustifiable 
penalties provided by the Code, intended to protect monarchial officials, the 
principle should be broadened so as to include every reasonable contingency. 
Under this hypothesis the defendant should be sentenced to two months and one 
day of <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span>, and to pay a fine of P125, with the accessory penalties 
and subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, as provided by law, with 
costs against him.</p>
<p>3. Should the defendant be acquitted? On the facts he should not. On the 
ideas suggested in the dissenting opinion of the undersigned in United States 
<span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Tabiana and Canillas, <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>, he should be. On the assumption, however, that 
chapter IV, title III, of the Penal Code is still in force, it being not 
entirely appropriate to repeat over and over again this dissent, the defendant 
should be convicted as above suggested, of a violation of article 252 of the 
Penal Code. I hold to the latter view.</p></div>
