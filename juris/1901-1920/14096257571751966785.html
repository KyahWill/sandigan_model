The petition gives the names of said persons, as&nbsp; follows:<br><br><blockquote>"The names, surnames, and post-office addresses of the owners of the parcels of land conterminous with&nbsp; this estate are, according to my information:<br><br>"The heirs of Antonio Enriquez, whose representatives are the attorneys Hartigan, Marple, Solignac &amp; Gutierrez, 7 Anda, Intramuros, Manila,&nbsp; Pedro&nbsp; P.&nbsp; Roxas, 154 Malacañang, San Miguel."</blockquote><br>Upon the presentation of said petition,&nbsp; the plan, and the documents showing the chain&nbsp; of title of the petitioner, the matter was referred to the examiner of titles of the Court of Land Registration, who made a very careful examination of the title of the petitioner to the land in question, and on the&nbsp; 5th day of March,&nbsp; 1906,&nbsp; presented&nbsp; a very carefully prepared report, in which he&nbsp; sets out&nbsp; in detail the title of the petitioner to said Parcel A, as well&nbsp; as the&nbsp; other parcels, and recommends the registration of said Parcel&nbsp; A, as well as the others, in the name of the petitioner.<br><br>Upon the issue thus presented we find that the&nbsp; Honorable Simplicio del Rosario, judge, on the 23d day of March, 1906, in accordance with the provisions of section 31 of Act No. 496, issued the following notice:<br><br><blockquote><center><br>"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, <br>"PHILIPPINE ISLANDS. <br>"[Registration of title.&nbsp; Court of Land Registration.<br> "Case No. 1895.]<br></center><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">"To the Attorney-General of the Philippine Islands; the Municipal Board of the&nbsp; city of Manila; A.

W. Hay, surveyor of&nbsp; the Bureau of Lands, was presented, in accordance&nbsp; with the order of the court&nbsp; of the&nbsp; 23d of December, 1911.&nbsp; Said&nbsp; new plan&nbsp; was made for the purpose of&nbsp; correcting the errors in closure in the original plan presented by the petitioner ^^n the&nbsp; 10th day of&nbsp; January,&nbsp; 1906.&nbsp;&nbsp; Said&nbsp; new plan&nbsp; is as follows&nbsp; (see page 48) :<br><br>After the presentation of said new or corrected plan, the motions:<br><br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>)&nbsp; That of the city&nbsp; of Manila to have corrected the error of closure in the original plan;<br><br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>)&nbsp; That of Maria&nbsp; del Consuelo Felisa Roxas y Chuidian, to have included in&nbsp; her certificate&nbsp; of title the&nbsp; buildings located&nbsp; upon the lands registered in accordance with her original petition; and<br><br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>) That of the Masonic Temple Association of Manila, to have a&nbsp; certificate issued to it&nbsp; in&nbsp; accordance with its contract of purchase of said lands from Maria del Consuelo<br><br>(<span style="font-weight: bold;">see image page 48 </span>)<br><br>Felisa Roxas y Chuidian—after notice had&nbsp; been&nbsp; given to all the interested parties, <i>were set down for&nbsp; hearing</i>.&nbsp; For one reason or another, the hearings on said motions were transferred from one date to another from the 22d&nbsp; of April, 1912, until the 24th of August, 1912.&nbsp;&nbsp; During said various hearings, in addition to the appointment of a commission to view the premises, certain proof was taken upon the question of the correctness&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; original plan presented by the petitioner,&nbsp; in January,&nbsp; 1906.&nbsp; During said hearings the heirs of Don Antonio Enriquez&nbsp; appeared and apparently made some objection to the granting of said motions.&nbsp;&nbsp; They presented no written&nbsp; statement in which their specific objections&nbsp; appear.&nbsp; The nearest&nbsp; approach to a definite and specific statement of their objections appears in&nbsp; the&nbsp; argument of&nbsp; their counsel at&nbsp; the close of said several hearings, in which it appears that their objection to the correction of the original plan and certificate and the issuance of a new certificate to the Masonic Temple Association&nbsp; of Manila was based upon the ground that they claimed easements&nbsp; or <span style="font-style: italic;">servitudes </span>in the land&nbsp; in the question.<br><br>After&nbsp; hearing all of the parties, the Honorable Charles H. Smith, judge of the Court of Land Registration, and his associates, the Honorable James A. Ostrand and the Honorable&nbsp; Norberto Romualdez,&nbsp; auxiliary judges of said court, sitting in bane, on the 24th day of August, 1912, by a unanimous decision, granted the motions of the city of Manila,&nbsp; of Maria del Consuelo Felisa Roxas y Chuidian, and of the Masonic&nbsp; Temple Association of Manila.<br><br>On the 10th day of September, 1912, the attorneys for the <span style="font-style: italic;">objectors </span>presented a&nbsp; motion for&nbsp; new trial, basing it upon the ground&nbsp; that the conclusions&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; lower court&nbsp; were manifestly contrary to the proof.&nbsp; After a due consideration of said motion for&nbsp; a&nbsp; new trial and after hearing the respective&nbsp; parties,&nbsp; the Court of&nbsp; Land Registration, sitting in bane,&nbsp; composed of Charles H. Smith, James A. Ostrand, and Norberto Romualdez, denied said motion, and the case was appealed to this court.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this court the respondents presented the following assignments of error:<br><br><blockquote>"1. That the court below erred in holding that the proceedings&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of Land Registration were valid in entering&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; in&nbsp; favor of the plaintiff and appellee, confirming the title to lot 4, which is in controversy in this suit.<br><br>"2. That the judgment of the lower court is contrary to law.<br><br>"3. That the judgment of the court below is against the manifest weight of the evidence."</blockquote><br>After a careful&nbsp; examination of the argument of the appellants in support of each of said assignments of error, we are of the opinion&nbsp; that they may be discussed together.<br><br>In&nbsp; the argument of the appellants&nbsp; in support of&nbsp; their assignments of error, there is but little argument against the decision of the court rendered on the 24th of August, 1912.&nbsp; Practically the whole&nbsp; argument of the&nbsp; appellants&nbsp; is based upon&nbsp; the ground that&nbsp; the original&nbsp; certificate&nbsp; (No. 742, issued July 21, 1906)&nbsp; is absolutely void, For the reason that "the appellants had no notice of the pendency of the original action to confirm the title of said property."&nbsp;&nbsp; Appellants now admit that a notice&nbsp; of the pendency of the original action was sent to attorneys Hartigan,&nbsp; Rohde&nbsp; &amp; (Marple?) Gutierrez.&nbsp; Appellants now allege that it affirmatively appears that neither this firm/nor any of its members represented&nbsp; the defendants and appellants in that action. The record shows, as we have pointed out above, that the original petition showed that Hartigan, Rohde &amp;&nbsp; Gutierrez were the representatives of the heirs of Don Antonio Enriquez, and that notice was duly sent&nbsp; to them.&nbsp; We&nbsp; have searched the record now in vain to find the slightest denial of the fact that they were the representatives of said heirs, even though one of said attorneys represented them,&nbsp; or at least some of them, in the present proceedings.&nbsp;&nbsp; So far as the record shows there is not even a suggestion found in the various hearings and proceedings taken and had under the above motions, that said attorneys were not the representatives&nbsp; of the heirs of Don Antonio Enriquez at the time of the original proceedings.&nbsp; Neither does the record show any attempt on their part to deny the fact that they received the notices given&nbsp; in the original&nbsp; action.&nbsp; The appellants assert in their argument that "personal notice was&nbsp; absolutely necessary in order to justify the court below in rendering a decree in favor of the plaintiff and appellee, in the first instance"&nbsp; (the original&nbsp; proceeding).&nbsp;&nbsp; The appellants, by that argument, attempt to&nbsp; show, not that the judgment of the 24th of August, 1912, was invalid, but that the original certificate (No. 742)&nbsp; was void, because they had not&nbsp; been served with personal notice.&nbsp; This brings us to the question whether or not personal notice to all of the persons interested in an action for the registration of real property under the Torrens system, is an absolute prerequisite to the validity of said&nbsp; registration.&nbsp; It will&nbsp; be remembered that we noted&nbsp; above&nbsp; that personal notice of the pendency of the original petition had been given&nbsp; and that a publication of the same had been made in accordance with the provisions of sections 31 and 32 of Act No. 496.&nbsp; After the expiration of the period during which notice must be given, the original cause was set down&nbsp; for hearing.&nbsp; The record also shows that the clerk of the&nbsp; Land Court made a certificate showing that that notice had been issued and published in accordance with the law.&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 32 provides, in part, that said "certificate of the clerk that he had served the&nbsp; notice as directed by the court, by publishing or mailing, shall be filed in the case before the return day, and shall be conclusive proof of such service."<br><br>On&nbsp; the day set for the hearing of said original petition, no one appeared to oppose the granting of the prayer which it contained. Section 35 of Act No. 496 provides:&nbsp; "If no person appears&nbsp; and&nbsp; answers within the time allowed, the court may at once, upon motion of the applicant, no reason to the contrary appearing, order a general default to be recorded and <span style="font-style: italic;">the application (petition)&nbsp; be taken for confessed.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; By the description in&nbsp; the notice,&nbsp; "<span style="font-style: italic;">To&nbsp; all whom it may concern,</span>" all the world are made parties defendant and shall&nbsp; be concluded&nbsp; by&nbsp; the default and order.&nbsp; The court shall not be bound by the report of the examiner of titles, but may require other and further proof."<br><br>The provisions of&nbsp; section 35 seem to be directly contrary to the contention of the appellants.&nbsp; It&nbsp; seems to&nbsp; directly contradict the requirement of personal notice as an absolute prerequisite to the granting of a valid title under the Torrens system.<br><br>The same idea is further&nbsp; confirmed by the provisions of section 38 of&nbsp; said Act No. 496.&nbsp; Said section 38 provides that:&nbsp; "<span style="font-style: italic;">Every decree of registration shall bind the land and quiet&nbsp; the title thereto, subject only to the exceptions stated in the following&nbsp; section.</span>&nbsp; It shall be conclusive upon and against all <span style="font-style: italic;">persons</span>, including the Insular Government, and all the branches thereof, whether mentioned by name in the application, notice or citation, or includes in the general description '<i>To all whom it may concern.</i>' "<br><br>There is a further and very strong intimation in the law that personal&nbsp; notice is not absolutely a prerequisite to the validity of&nbsp; title&nbsp; under the&nbsp; Torrens system.&nbsp;&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 32 (Act&nbsp; No. 496) provides that:&nbsp;&nbsp; "The court shall,&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">so far as it deems it possible</span>, require proof of actual&nbsp; notice to all the adjoining owners and to all&nbsp; persons who appear to have an interest in or claim to the land included in&nbsp; the application." <span style="font-style: italic;">It will be noted also that the petitioner in registration cases is not by law required to give any notice to any person.</span> The law requires the clerk of the court to&nbsp; give the notices. (Sections 31 and 32 of Act&nbsp; No. 496.)&nbsp;&nbsp; It is true that "the court may also cause&nbsp; other or further notice of the application to be given in such a manner and to such persons as it may deem proper."&nbsp; Thus it is seen that the applicant is by express provision of law relieved from any&nbsp; obligation whatsoever to&nbsp; give notice to any person of the&nbsp; pendency of his application to have his land registered under the&nbsp; Torrens system.&nbsp; That being true, upon what theory may the applicant be subjected&nbsp; to harassment&nbsp; or&nbsp; delay or additional expense, because some person claims that he did not receive actual personal notice?&nbsp;&nbsp; Sections 101&nbsp; and 102 (Act&nbsp; No. 496)&nbsp; seem to contain a remedy for persons who have suffered damages for the failure on the part&nbsp; of court officials to comply with the law.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Noble State Bank <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.&nbsp; Haskell, 219 U. S., 104.)&nbsp;&nbsp; His remedy is not to have the registration and certificate annulled, unless he comes within the provisions of section 38, and even then he is without a remedy against the applicant unless he&nbsp; can show, within a period of one year after the decree of registration and the granting of the certificate, that he has been "deprived of land or any estate or interest therein," <span style="font-style: italic;">by fraud,</span> and not even then, if an "innocent purchaser for value has acquired an interest." In the present case five years and a half had transpired and negotiations for the sale of the land to an innocent purchaser had been terminated.&nbsp; There is no intimation that the petitioner is guilty of fraud,&nbsp; in the slightest degree.<br><br>While the Torrens Land Law is&nbsp; a law of modern times, it has been adopted in many States and its provisions have been attacked at almost every point. The requirement relating&nbsp; to&nbsp; notices has been a fruitful source of litigation. The&nbsp; constitutionality of the law has been attacked many times,&nbsp; because of the provision of said&nbsp; law&nbsp; relating&nbsp; to notices.&nbsp; This is not the first time that the question has been presented to this court.&nbsp; The same question&nbsp; was presented to this court in the case of Grey Alba vs. De la Cruz (17 Phil. Rep., 49).&nbsp; In that case the registered title was attacked upon the ground that fraud existed, simply because personal notice&nbsp; had not been&nbsp; given!) The existence of fraud was predicated upon the failure%f&nbsp; actual personal notice.&nbsp;&nbsp; In passing upon that question, this court, speaking through Mr. Justice Trent, said&nbsp; (quoting from the syllabus) :<br><blockquote>"In&nbsp; original proceedings&nbsp; for the registration of land under&nbsp; Act No. 496, the appellee herein was&nbsp; made a party-defendant by publication, <span style="font-style: italic;">but&nbsp; was not personally served with notice:</span> Held, That the decree of the Court of Land Registration is conclusive against him as well as all the world."<br><br>"The proceedings for the registration of land, under Act No. 496, are in rem and&nbsp; not<span style="font-style: italic;"> in personam</span>.&nbsp; A proceeding in rem, dealing with a tangible res, may be instituted and carried to judgment&nbsp; without personal service upon the claimants within the state or notice by name to those outside of it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Jurisdiction is secured by the&nbsp; power of the court over the res.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a proceeding would be impossible were this not so, for it would hardly do to make a distinction between the constitutional rights of claimants who were known and those who were not known to the plaintiff, when the proceeding is&nbsp; to&nbsp; bar all.&nbsp; (Tyler vs. Judges, 175 Mass., 71.)"</blockquote>In the present case there is not the slightest intimation that the&nbsp; original applicant&nbsp; (Maria del Consuelo&nbsp; Felisa Roxas&nbsp; y Chuidian) was guilty of fraud.&nbsp; The record shows that she named all the persons who might have an interest in the&nbsp; registration of her land, in her petition.&nbsp; The applicant is not charged even&nbsp; with negligence.&nbsp; The&nbsp; record shows&nbsp; that she did all the law required her to do.<br><br>In discussing the&nbsp; Torrens&nbsp; Land Law we must keep in mind that its&nbsp; primary purpose is&nbsp; the&nbsp; registration&nbsp; of the title which&nbsp; the applicant or petitioner has&nbsp; and&nbsp; to&nbsp; relieve his land of unknown liens or claims, just qr unjust, against it.&nbsp; The Torrens&nbsp; system of land registration is a system for the registration of&nbsp; title to land only,&nbsp; and not a system established&nbsp; for the acquisition of land.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is not intended that lands may be acquired by said system&nbsp; of registration. It is intended only that the title, which the&nbsp; petitioner has, shall be registered and thereby cleared of all&nbsp; liens&nbsp; and burdens of&nbsp; whatsoever character, <span style="font-style: italic;">except&nbsp; </span>those which shall be noted&nbsp; in the order of registration and in the&nbsp; certificate issued.<br><br>If there exist <span style="font-style: italic;">known </span>and just claims against the title of the applicant, he gains&nbsp; nothing in effect by his registration, except in&nbsp; the simplicity of subsequent transfers of his title. The registration either&nbsp; relieves the land of all known as well as unknown claims, absolutely, or it compels the claimants to come into court and to make there a record, so that there- after&nbsp; there may be no uncertainty&nbsp; concerning&nbsp; either the character or the extent of such claims.<br><br>The requirement that personal notice shall be a prerequisite&nbsp; to&nbsp; the validity of registration would absolutely prohibit&nbsp; foreclosure of unknown claims, for the reason that personal&nbsp; notice could never be given to "unknown claimants" The great difficulty in land titles arises from the existence of possible&nbsp; unknown claimants.&nbsp;&nbsp; Known claimants can be dealt with.&nbsp; They furnish no valid impediment, in fact, to the transfer of titles.<br><br>Courts have held that in actions in rem personal notice to owners of a res is not necessary to give the courts jurisdiction to deal with and to dispose of the&nbsp; res.&nbsp; (Grey Alba vs.&nbsp; De&nbsp; la Cruz, 17 Phil. Rep.,&nbsp; 49;&nbsp; Tyler vs. Judges,&nbsp; 175 Mass., 71; American Land Company <span style="font-style: italic;">vs </span>Zeiss,&nbsp; 219 U. S., 47.) This rule was&nbsp; first established in admiralty proceedings. It was established out of the very necessities of the case. The owner of a ship,&nbsp; for&nbsp; instance,&nbsp; lived in&nbsp; London.&nbsp;&nbsp; His ship was found in the most distant ports of the earth.&nbsp; Its operation necessarily&nbsp; required supplies, such as men, coal, and food.&nbsp; The very nature of its business necessitated the making of contracts.&nbsp; The continuance of its voyage&nbsp; depended upon its capacity to make contracts and to get credit. It might also, perchance, cause damage to other craft, in like conditions.&nbsp; To be able to&nbsp; secure all such necessities, to satisfy all possible obligations, to continue&nbsp; its voyage&nbsp; and its&nbsp; business on the high seas, merchants and courts came to regard the "ship" as a person, with whom&nbsp; or with which they were dealing, and not its&nbsp; real owner.&nbsp; Consequently there came into existence this action in rem.&nbsp;&nbsp; For the purpose of carrying into effect the&nbsp; broader purposes&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Torrens land law, it has been&nbsp; universally considered that the action should be considered as one in rem.&nbsp; Mr. Justice Holmes, then of the Supreme Court&nbsp; of the State of Massachusetts, and now a member of the Supreme Court of the United States, in the&nbsp; case&nbsp; of Tyler vs. Judges (175 Mass., 71), in discussing this question, said:<br><br><blockquote>"Looked at either from&nbsp; the point of view of history or of the necessary requirements of justice, a&nbsp; proceeding <i>in rem</i>, dealing with a&nbsp; tangible <i>res</i>, may be&nbsp; instituted&nbsp; and carried to judgment without personal service upon claimants within the State or notice by name to those outside of it, and not encounter any provision of&nbsp; either constitution&nbsp; (of the State of&nbsp; Massachusetts or the United States).&nbsp; Jurisdiction&nbsp; is secured&nbsp; by&nbsp; the power of the court over the <i>res</i>.&nbsp; As&nbsp; we have&nbsp; said,&nbsp; such a&nbsp; proceeding would&nbsp; be&nbsp; impossible were this not so, for it hardly would do to make a distinction between the constitutional rights of claimants who were known and those who were not known to the plaintiff, when the proceeding is to bar all.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Pennoyer <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Neff, 95 U. S., 714, 727; The Mary, 9 Cranch, 126, 144.)"</blockquote>There&nbsp; are many classes of cases where men may be deprived of their property and of their rights, without personal&nbsp; notice of the proceedings in which that may&nbsp; occur. For instance, in attachment cases, notice or service&nbsp; upon the defendant may be had by publication.&nbsp; (Pennoyer <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Neff, 95&nbsp; U. S., 714, 727.)&nbsp; So also in divorce proceedings, as well as the rights of claimants against estates of deceased persons,&nbsp; personal notice is not a&nbsp; prerequisite.&nbsp; Notice by publication may be had.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also unknown claimants or owners may be brought into court&nbsp; without personal&nbsp; notice in an action for the condemnation of private property for public use.&nbsp; There exists a multitude of cases in which personal service is not necessary and service by publication is sufficient.<br><br>The law, even before the Torrens Law, provided means by which title to land might be quieted "by notice by publication to all persons."&nbsp; (Hamilton <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.

S., 47; Title, Document, etc., Company&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.&nbsp; Kerrigan, 150 CaL, 289.)"<br><br>The only case cited by the appellants in support of their argument, is the case of the American Land Company vs. Zeiss (219 U. S., 47).&nbsp; In view of the facts and the decisions of the&nbsp; different courts which are cited in that case, it is difficult to understand how it is authority in support of the contention of the appellants here.&nbsp; The facts in that case are as follows :<br><br>Zeiss, on the 22d of August, 1906, commenced an action in the superior&nbsp; court of the county of San Francisco, alleging in&nbsp; substance that on the 18th and 19th days of April, 1906, a material part of the public records contained in&nbsp; the office of the county recorder of the city and county of San Francisco was&nbsp; destroyed by fire;&nbsp; that on the 18th day of April, 1906, and at the time of the filing of the complaint, he was&nbsp; the owner and in the actual and peaceable possession of the parcels of land in controversy: that his estate, title, interest in and&nbsp; to&nbsp; said parcels of land, and each of them, was that of owner in fee simple, absolute, free from all encumbrances, liens,&nbsp; defects, claims or demands of any kind or nature whatsoever.&nbsp; Under these facts the plaintiff, Zeiss, prayed that he be adjudged to be the owner of and entitled to the&nbsp; possession of said described parcels of land in fee&nbsp; simple, and that no&nbsp; one else had any estate,&nbsp; right, title, interest or claim in or to the same, or any part thereof, either legal or&nbsp; equitable, present or future, vested or contingent.<br><br>Upon the presentation of the petition by Zeiss, a summons was issued and notice of the pendency of the&nbsp; action was published in certain newspapers,&nbsp; as was required by law. Notice was also posted upon the property, as required by the statute.&nbsp; No one having appeared and opposed the granting of the petition&nbsp; of the complaint, or claimed any interest in or lien upon the property described&nbsp; in the&nbsp; complaint,&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">a default was&nbsp; ordered against all persons</span>,&nbsp; and on the 19th day&nbsp; of December, 1906,&nbsp; a decree&nbsp; was entered in favor of Zeiss, adjudging that he was the&nbsp; owner in fee&nbsp; simple,&nbsp; absolute, and entitled to the possession of the land described in the complaint and that no other person had any&nbsp; right,title, interest, or estate in and to the same, or any part thereof, either legal or equitable, present or future, vested or contingent.<br><br>Nothing else seems to have transpired after said decree was issued in favor of Zeiss, until the 26th day of May, 1908, or one year and five months after the entry of the decree of the superior court, in the city and county of San Francisco. On that date&nbsp; (the 26th of May, 1908)&nbsp; an action was brought in the United States Circuit Court for the Northern District of&nbsp; California, in which the plaintiffs claimed title to the parcels of land, <span style="font-style: italic;">as owners in fee simple</span>, absolute, which had theretofore been decreed to Zeiss.&nbsp; The plaintiff alleged that the decree issued by&nbsp; the&nbsp; superior&nbsp; court of the city and county of San Francisco was void and of no force and effect and was made and maintained without due&nbsp; process of law, and <span style="font-style: italic;">that said superior court</span>, in said action and proceeding, n<span style="font-style: italic;">ever had any jurisdiction over the persons holding the title during such proceeding, and that said court&nbsp; did not have or obtain jurisdiction to divest the right, title, interest or estate of plaintiff.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; The complaint alleged that "Zeiss had no right whatever in&nbsp; said parcels of land, other&nbsp; than his right of possession and occupation." The bill further alleged that the plaintiffs had been at all times citizens and residents of California, not seeking to evade, but ready to accept service of summons and easily reached for that purpose; that, notwithstanding that fact,<i> no service was made upon them nor did they in any way receive notice of the pendency of the action</i> (Zeiss vs. All persons claiming any interest in or lien upon the real property herein described)&nbsp; ;<i> nor did they gain any knowledge of the existence of the decree until more than a year&nbsp; after its&nbsp; entry</i>.&nbsp; To the complaint the defendant, Zeiss, demurred.<br><br>Upon&nbsp; the&nbsp; issue&nbsp; thus presented,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Circuit Court&nbsp; of Appeals for&nbsp; the Ninth District certified the questions involved to the Supreme&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of the United States.&nbsp; The Supreme Court of the United States, after a careful analysis of the facts and of the law, in a very lengthy and instructive opinion (219 U. S., 47), decided each of the questions submitted by the Circuit Court of Appeals against the contention&nbsp; of the plaintiff and returned the cause to the court below.<br><br>The original action by Zeiss was&nbsp; brought to quiet the title to two parcels of land and for the purpose of registering his title to the same under an act of&nbsp; the legislature of the State of California,&nbsp; entitled&nbsp; "An&nbsp; act&nbsp; to provide&nbsp; for the establishment and quieting of title to real property in case of loss or destruction of public records."&nbsp;&nbsp; Said law is known as the McEnerney Law.&nbsp; It&nbsp; was intended by said act to provide a&nbsp; method whereby owners in possession of real estate, where records had been destroyed to such an extent as to make it impossible to trace a record title, might secure a decree in the courts which would furnish public, authenticated evidence of title.&nbsp; The&nbsp; special occasion for the law was the fact&nbsp; that practically all of the&nbsp; public records of title in several counties in the State&nbsp; of California ha4&nbsp; recently theretofore been destroyed as the result of an earthquake and fire.&nbsp; Said law provided that whenever the public records in the office of the county recorder had been, or shall hereafter&nbsp; be lost or&nbsp; destroyed, in whole or in any material part, by flood, fire, or earthquake, <span style="font-style: italic;">any person</span> who claims an estate of inheritance or have title in, and who has by himself or&nbsp; his tenants, or&nbsp; other persons&nbsp; holding under&nbsp; him, in actual and peaceable possession any&nbsp; real property in said county, may bring and maintain an action <span style="font-style: italic;">in rem</span>, against all the world, in the superior&nbsp; court for the county in which said real&nbsp; property is situate, to establish his title, and <i>to determine&nbsp; all adverse claims thereto</i>.<br><br>The law further&nbsp; provides&nbsp; that an&nbsp; action shall be&nbsp; commenced by the filing of a verified complaint, in which he shall name the defendants as "all persons&nbsp; claiming any interest in or lien upon the real property herein described, or any part&nbsp; thereof."&nbsp; He&nbsp; was required to give in&nbsp; his complaint a particular description of the property.&nbsp;&nbsp; The law provided that upon the filing of&nbsp; the complaint, a summons or notice was required to be issued,&nbsp; containing&nbsp; the names of the court and the county in which the&nbsp; action was brought, the name of the plaintiff, and a particular description of the property involved, which notice was directed to "all persons claiming any interest in or lien upon the real property herein described, or any part thereof," as defendants.<br><br>The law&nbsp; further provided that said summons&nbsp; or notice should be published in&nbsp; a&nbsp; newspaper of general circulation in the county where the action was brought, at least once a week for a period of two months.<br><br>The law further&nbsp; provided that personal notice should be given to any person claiming an interest in the property or a lien thereon adverse to the plaintiff.<br><br>The law also provided that said summons or notice should be posted in a conspicuous place on each parcel of property described in the complaint, within fifteen days after the first publication&nbsp; of the summons or notice.<br><br>The said&nbsp; law further provided that upon the publication and posting of the summons and its service upon and mailing to the person, if any, upon whom it is herein directed to be specially served, the court shall have full and complete jurisdiction over the plaintiff and said property and of the person and every one claiming any estate, right, title, or interest in or to or lien upon said property,&nbsp; or any part thereof, and shall be deemed to have obtained the possession and control of said property, for the&nbsp; purposes of the action,&nbsp; and shall have full and complete jurisdiction to render judgment therein,&nbsp; which is provided for in the law.<br><br>In the case of the American Land Company <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Zeiss, cited and relied upon by the appellants, the validity of said law was attacked and the legality of the title granted to Zeiss was impugned for the reason that the law was unconstitutional and void, and because the plaintiff had&nbsp; not received actual notice of the application of Zeiss to have his title quieted, under said&nbsp; law.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Supreme Court of the United States (219 U. S., 47) held, as has been above indicated, that the law was constitutional and that a compliance with the requirements&nbsp; of&nbsp; the notice provided for in said law was sufficient to give the court jurisdiction over&nbsp; the res and to enter a valid decree.&nbsp; There seems to be but little in&nbsp; the decision in the case of the American Land Company vs. Zeiss to support the contention of the appellants.<br><br>Considering that the Legislature of the Philippine Islands had full power to adopt the procedure provided for in Act No. 496, for the registration of the title of lands; and<br><br>Considering that the court in the original action followed strictly the procedure adopted by said law; and<br><br>Considering&nbsp; that there is no claim of fraud, actual&nbsp; or constructive, upon the part of any of the parties connected with said action, we are forced to the conclusion that&nbsp; the appellants here are not now entitled to have that judgment or decree of registration and certificate amended&nbsp; or&nbsp; set aside.<br><br>There remains another question,&nbsp; however, which the&nbsp; appellants have not discussed&nbsp; and which we deem of&nbsp; importance.&nbsp; It is the question of the right of the Land Court to <span style="font-style: italic;">correct an error of closure</span> in a plan or of a statement contained in a certificate.&nbsp; A plan is prepared and is presented with the petition for the registration of a&nbsp; parcel of land. No opponents appear.&nbsp;&nbsp; No&nbsp; opposition is presented to&nbsp; the registration.&nbsp; All the steps in the procedure&nbsp; required by law have been taken.&nbsp; The land is registered.&nbsp; It is then&nbsp; discovered for the first time that by reason of a wrong direction given to one of the lines in the plan,&nbsp; said plan will&nbsp; not close—that if a wall were built&nbsp; upon the lines of the plan, one of the four corners of the wall would&nbsp; not meet.&nbsp;&nbsp; We believe that an&nbsp; error of that character may&nbsp; be corrected by the court, provided that such correction does&nbsp; not include land not included in&nbsp; the original petition.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the question&nbsp; whether the amended plan&nbsp; (p. 252, record) included more or different lands than were included in the original petition, we find the following statement made by one of the judges who ordered said plan amended.&nbsp;&nbsp; The statement is:<br><br><blockquote>"At&nbsp; this stage of the proceedings and on this particular point nothing further is&nbsp; incumbent upon the court than to determine the property as it was adjudicated in this case.<br><br>"Therein no new portion was either added or subtracted, and this court finds that such should be the holding on this particular point." We have a further statement made by one of the judges, the Honorable Charles H.&nbsp; Smith, relating to the same question, in an answer presented by him to&nbsp; a petition for a writ of prohibition, presented by some of the appellants herein, to the Supreme Court.&nbsp;&nbsp; That petition for a writ of prohibition&nbsp; involved practically the same questions presented by the appellants here now.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the question whether or not additional lands had been&nbsp; included in the new plan (p. 252, record), Judge Smith,&nbsp; in answering for himself and his associates (Ostrand and Romualdez) said:<br><br>"Respondents deny that a new dividing line between the premises in question&nbsp; (premises of the plaintiff and appellant) was determined and established by an order&nbsp; of the court issued at the conclusion of said&nbsp; proceedings, but, on the contrary, respondents charge the truth to be that the dividing line between said properties was not changed but simply approved and so indicated upon the record title.&nbsp; For instance, the line between said properties beginning on the south side of the&nbsp; Escolta is exactly at&nbsp; the same point indicated in the original description and approved by the court; in other words, the premises in question of the said Maria del Consuelo Felisa Roxas y Chuidian have not been enlarged ; the boundary lines thereof have not been changed; the&nbsp; real descriptions&nbsp; of the&nbsp; properties have been left undisturbed; the adjoining land owned by the petitioners is undiminished,&nbsp; except possibly as to alleged easements claimed to have been created by the projection of some of the roofs of the petitioners' building over the&nbsp; aforesaid registered prpperty of the said Roxas.&nbsp; That matter is settled&nbsp; clearly by the provisions of&nbsp; the last paragraph of section 39 of Act No. 496."</blockquote><br>We called attention above to the fact that the petitioner alleged that the line A-B of her property ran S., 44° 30' W., a distance of 31.08 meters, while the plan accompanying&nbsp; said petition (see Exhibit A,&nbsp; page 35,&nbsp; ante)&nbsp; made said line to run S., 46° 30' W., a distance of 31.08 meters.<br><br>An examination of the certificate issued to the petitioner (see page 39, <span style="font-style: italic;">ante</span>)&nbsp; also states&nbsp; that the line A-B runs&nbsp; S., 46°&nbsp; 30' W.,&nbsp; for a distance of&nbsp; 31.08 meters.&nbsp; The&nbsp; record contains no explanation why the original plan (see Exhibit A, page 35,&nbsp; ante) did not conform&nbsp; to&nbsp; the description of the land given in the petition.&nbsp; That error, in our judgment, seems to have constituted the real difficulty with the closure of the&nbsp; plan.&nbsp;&nbsp; Under said conditions we are of the opinion that the Land Court is entirely justified&nbsp; in&nbsp; ordering the plan corrected for the purposes above indicated.<br><br>There is still another question involved in the case, which the appellants have not discussed, and that is the right of Maria&nbsp; del Consuelo&nbsp; Felisa Roxas y Chuidian to have her original certificate of registration corrected, for the purpose of showing that she was the owner of the buildings located upon the parcel of land in question.&nbsp; It will be remembered that in her petition presented January 12, 1906,&nbsp; she alleged that she was&nbsp; the owner of the&nbsp; parcel of land in question, together with the <span style="font-style: italic;">buildings </span>thereon.&nbsp; No&nbsp; opposition was presented.&nbsp;&nbsp; No objection was made to the registration of the land as described in her petition.&nbsp; The record shows no reason why the buildings should have been omitted in the certificate of&nbsp; registration.&nbsp; The omission&nbsp; must have&nbsp; been an error on the part of the clerk.&nbsp; We find that Act No. 496 contains an express provision for the correction of&nbsp; such errors.&nbsp; Section 112 provides that the registered&nbsp; owner may, at any time, apply by petition to have corrected any "error, omission, or mistake made in&nbsp; entering a certificate, or any memorandum thereon, or&nbsp; on&nbsp; any duplicate certificate."&nbsp; We think the petition&nbsp; presented by&nbsp; Miss Roxas for the correction of such original certificate was entirely within her&nbsp; right under&nbsp; the law.&nbsp; It might be claimed, and we believe that the proposition is&nbsp; sustained by law, that the registration of a parcel of land, unless the&nbsp; record contains something to the contrary, necessarily includes the buildings and edifices located thereon, even though they are not mentioned.&nbsp; Without&nbsp;&nbsp; relying&nbsp; upon&nbsp; that proposition of&nbsp; law, however, and&nbsp; in view of the petition of&nbsp; the plaintiff,&nbsp; it is hereby ordered&nbsp; that the original certificate be amended so as to&nbsp; include not only&nbsp; the land described in the original petition, but the buildings located thereon&nbsp; as well. With&nbsp; reference to the petition of&nbsp; the Masonic&nbsp; Temple Association of&nbsp; Manila,&nbsp; the record contains&nbsp; no&nbsp; sufficient reason for not granting the same.<br><br>Therefore, and in&nbsp; view of all of the foregoing, we are of the opinion that the&nbsp; judgment of the court below&nbsp; should be and&nbsp; it is hereby affirmed, with costs.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Carson, Trent,</i> and <i>Araullo, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
