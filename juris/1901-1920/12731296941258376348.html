				<H3>CESAREO CABABAN, PLAINTIFF, VS. JOHN P. WEISSENHAGEN AND SIXTO CAMARA, DEFENDANTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>FISHER, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The final judgment in this case was rendered August 2, 1918. To this judgment 
the defendant excepted in writing the following day. He might have taken a bill 
of exceptions and upon his appeal might have urged all the questions he now 
seeks to raise by this proceeding. Upon the facts we are of the opinion that no 
relief can be granted under section 513, Code of Civil Procedure. The judgment 
complained of was not rendered against petitioner upon default. On the contrary, 
he answered and was represented at the hearing by counsel. His failure to attend 
court and produce evidence did not constitute a default. The refusal of the 
court to grant a continuance may have been error, and might have been ground for 
a reversal had the case been brought here by appeal, but cannot be corrected by 
such a proceeding as this.
<p>The petition is denied and the case is dismissed. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Johnson, Street, Malcolm</em>, and <em>Avance√±a, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p></div>
