				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is an action for damages for breach of contract in the construction of a skating rink which the defendant, a contractor and architect, agreed to build for the plaintiff, for the sum of 7,250 pesos, Mexican currency.</p>
<p>Plaintiff alleges that the  defendant failed  to complete the work within  the specified time, and that the building was  constructed  in so unworkmanlike  a manner and  of such inferior materials that when completed it was wholly unfitted for use as a skating rink, and that as a consequence he had suffered damages in the sum of 7,250 pesos.</p>
<p>Defendant denies the claim of damages presented by the plaintiff, and alleges that while it is true that the work was not completed within the time specified in the original contract, the delay was due to certain changes made in the original plan at the request  of the plaintiff, and that the materials used and the work done on the building were in accordance with the contract,  and were accepted and approved by the plaintiff.  Defendant  further alleges  that the original plans for  the  construction of the  building having been abandoned, new plans were prepared, and the price for the entire work was fixed at  10,969 pesos, and prays  that judgment  be  rendered in his favor for the balance of 3,717 pesos,  being  the difference between the amount actually paid and the amount agreed upon under the new contract.</p>
<p>We are of opinion that the evidence of record fully sustains the finding of the trial court that the contract price for the construction of the building under  the modified plans was 7,250 pesos, as alleged by the plaintiff, and not 9,969 pesos, as claimed  by the defendant.</p>
<p>We also think that the evidence of  record  establishes that the failure of the defendant to turn over the building within the time specified in the original contract was due to changes in the plans made at the instance of the plaintiff, and that the defendant should not be held responsible therefor.</p>
<p>The trial court  found that  the defendant so far failed in the performance of his contract, both in  regard to the quality of the materials used in the building and the workmanlike manner in  which  it was  constructed, that the plaintiff was damaged thereby in the sum of 3,625 pesos, and judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff for that amount.  But while we  agree that the evidence of record fully sustains the finding of the trial court that the quality of the materials and the workmanship employed in the building were so inferior as  to constitute a breach of the defendant's contract, which  entailed a heavy loss upon  the plaintiff, we are unable to find any evidence which would sustain the finding of the trial court as to the precise amount of the damages allowed.</p>
<p>Except in those  cases where the law authorizes  the imposition of punitive or exemplary damages, a party claiming damages  must establish by  competent  evidence the amount of such damages, and courts can not  give judgment  for a greater amount than that actually proven.</p>
<p>The trial court fixed the damage  at exactly 50 per cent of the amount paid the  defendant for the construction of the building, but a careful examination of the record fails to disclose any evidence whatever as to the precise amount of the damages other than that which goes  to  show that after  taking  over  the  building from the defendant the plaintiff was  compelled to expend  some  1,100 pesos  in repairs upon the roof, floors, and  outbuildings;  and the statement of the plaintiff that the building  when  completed was of no value whatever, and that he, was damaged in substantially the total amount paid the defendant.</p>
<p>We are of opinion that the amount  expended by the plaintiff  in  completing  the building and in  correcting the  defects  of  construction  which he found  therein  on looking it over is the true and only measure of the damages which can be allowed  him in this  action.  The evidence shows that  after the  defendant ceased  work upon the building, the plaintiff, while protesting vigorously because of defendant's failure  to complete  it  in  accordance  with his contract, did in fact take it over, and expended  so much money as  he deemed necessary to  correct defects in  its construction. We think  this expenditure was  in  fact necessary and proper, and that there would have  been no need therefor had the defendant complied faithfully  with the terms of his contract.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed  from  should be reversed and the case remanded to the trial court at the expiration of twenty days, when judgment  will be entered in favor of the plaintiff for an amount expressed in Philippine currency equivalent to 1,100 pesos,  Mexican currency,  with legal interest thereon from the commencement of this action, and the costs in first instance.   No costs should be allowed either party on appeal.  So ordered.</p>
