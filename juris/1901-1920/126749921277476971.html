				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. VICTORIANO JOANINO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This defendant was charged with the crime of bigamy, was arrested, duly 
arraigned, tried, found guilty, and sentenced by the judge of the Court of First 
Instance of the Province of Nueva Ecija to be imprisoned for a period of eight 
years and one day of prision mayor, with the accessories of the law, and to pay 
the costs. From that sentence the defendant appealed to this court and makes 
three assignments of error, each of which, however, raises a question of fact 
only, relating to the sufficiency of the proof adduced during the trial of the 
cause to support the sentence imposed.
<p>From the evidence it appears that on or about the 22d day of May, 1890, the 
defendant was joined in the bonds of holy matrimony to one Hipolita Rosario; 
that he continued to live with the said Rosario as her husband until the year 
1896, or 1897, when he was deported by the Spanish Government from the 
Philippine Islands to the island of Guam; that he remained in the island of Guam 
until the year 1901 or 1902, when he returned to the Philippine Islands; that 
while he remained in the island of Guam he acted as a clerk or escribiente in 
the court of first instance in said island; that when he returned to the 
Philippine Islands he found that his wife, Hipolita Rosario, had been living and 
cohabiting with one Gregorio Malinit, and that as a result of such illicit 
cohabitation the said Hipolita Rosario had given birth to two children during 
the absence of the defendant; that within a short period after the return of the 
defendant from the island of Guam, he, being informed of the illicit relations 
of his wife with the said Gregorio Malinit, commenced proceedings to be divorced 
from his wife, Hipolita Rosario, in the Court of First Instance of the Province 
of Pangasinan; that after the trial of the said divorce proceedings, the court 
found that the facts justified the petition of the plaintiff (the defendant, 
Victoriano Joanino) and granted the divorce prayed for; that thereafter, on the 
9th day of May, 1908, he was joined in wedlock with one Maria Roque; that at the 
time of the second marriage the said Hipolita Rosario was still living.</p>
<p>During the trial of the cause the defendant admitted all of the foregoing 
facts. He attempted, however, to justify his second marriage upon the ground 
that he believed that when a divorce had been granted him he had a right to 
remarry. He alleged that while he was in the island of Guam he had known some 
cases in which a divorce had been granted and where the parties had remarried. 
He admitted, however, that at the time he was granted a divorce from his wife, 
Hipolita Rosario, he had been informed by the court that the divorce which had 
been granted him did not permit him to remarry; that the divorce which had been 
granted him amounted to nothing more or less than a decree of separationâ€”a 
decree of separation from bed and board simply.</p>
<p>In this court the defendant, through his attorney, has filed a very 
interesting brief, in which he attempts to justify his second marriage upon the 
ground of his belief of the fact that when a divorce had been granted to parties 
under the laws of the Philippine Islands they were permitted to remarry during 
the life of the former spouse. He presents much argument and many facts which 
appeal to the sympathy of the court. His arguments and his facts can in no way 
influence the decision of the court when there are positive rules of law 
governing in such cases. His arguments would be proper in asking for clemency 
from the executive department of the Government. He cites no authorities, either 
statutory or judicial, in support of his contention that the defendant, having 
been divorced simply from his former spouse, had a right to remarry.</p>
<p>Under the <em>laws</em> in force in the Philippine Islands, <em>the granting 
of a divorce does in no way annul the marriage.</em> <em>The divorce does not 
destroy the marriage vinculum.</em> (Law 3, Title 2, Partida 4.)</p>
<p>Said Law 3, Title 2, of the fourth Partida, among other things, provides the 
following: "Yet, with all this, they (husband and wife) may separate, if one of 
them commit the sin of adultery,; or join any religious order, with the consent 
of the other, after they have known each other carnally. And notwithstanding 
they separate for one of these causes, no longer to live together, <em>yet the 
marriage is not dissolved on that ground." </em>(See also Law A, Title 10, 
Partida 4.)</p>
<p>We find also that Law 7, Title 2, Partida 4, provides, among other things, as 
follows: "So great is the tie and force of marriage, that when legally 
contracted it cannot be dissolved, notwithstanding one of the parties should 
turn heretic, or Jew, or Moor, or should commit adultery. Nevertheless, from any 
of these causes they may be separated by a judgment of the church, so as to live 
no longer together, nor to have any carnal intercourse with one another, 
according to what is said in the title on the clergy, in the law which begins 
with the words 'otorgandose algunos.' " </p>
<p>In the case of Benedicto <em>vs.</em> De la Rama (3 Phil. Rep., 34), and in 
numerous other cases, this court has held that the above-quoted provisions of 
the Partidas govern the question of divorce in the Philippine Islands. The 
change of sovereignty from the Spanish to the American, even though such change 
had the effect to transfer the power of granting divorces wholly to the civil 
authorities, did in no way affect or change the effect of divorce. The effect of 
a divorce granted under the law has not been changed, even though the 
ecclesiastical courts no longer exercise the power of granting a divorce.</p>
<p>We find nothing either in the record or in the law governing the facts in the 
present case, which justifies a reversal or a modification of the sentence 
imposed by the lower court.</p>
<p>The same is, therefore, hereby affirmed, with costs.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Carson,</em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.,</em> 
concur.</p>
