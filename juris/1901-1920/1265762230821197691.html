				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. ANTONIO JAVIER DICHAO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MORELAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from an order of the Court of First Instance of the 
Fourteenth Judicial District sustaining a demurrer to an information and 
dismissing the case.
<p>The information is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The undersigned accuses one Antonio Javier Dichao of the crime of rape, 
committed as follows:</p>
<p>"On or about and during the interval between October, 1910, to August, 1912, 
in the municipality of Davao, District of Davao, Moro Province, P. I., the 
aforesaid accused did then and there, willfully, maliciously, and feloniously 
have sexual intercourse with, and did lie with, and carnally know a woman, 
Isabel de la Cruz, under 12 years of age, in the following manner, to wit: the 
aforesaid accused is the stepfather of the aforesaid Isabel de la Cruz and 
during the aforesaid period was the legal guardian of said Isabel de la Cruz; 
that by threats and corporal punishment upon said Isabel de la Cruz, the 
aforesaid accused, Antonio Javier Dichao, had sexual intercourse with and did 
lie with and carnally know said Isabel de la Cruz; as a result whereof the said 
Isabel de la Cruz gave birth on August 5, 1912, to a child. All contrary to 
law."</p></blockquote>
<p>The demurrer alleged:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That the facts therein set forth and contained do not constitute a public 
offense.</p>
<p>"That the said criminal complaint does not conform substantially to the 
prescribed form.<br><br>"That said complaint is vague and 
ambiguous."</p></blockquote>
<p>We are of the opinion that the order appealed from must be affirmed. The 
allegations of an information should, if possible, be sufficiently explicit and 
certain as to time to inform the defendant of the date on which the criminal act 
is alleged to have been committed. Unless the accused is informed of the day, or 
about the day, he may be, to an extent, deprived of the opportunity to defend 
himself.</p>
<p>While section 7 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that "except when 
time is a material ingredient of an offense, the precise time of commission need 
not be stated in a complaint or information, but the act may be alleged to have 
been committed at any time before the filing thereof," this does not mean that 
the prosecuting officer may be careless about fixing the date of the alleged 
crime, or that he may omit the date altogether, or that he may make the 
allegation so indefinite as to amount to the same thing. Where the exact date 
cannot be fixed, or where the prosecuting officer is not thoroughly satisfied 
that he can prove a precise date, he should allege in the information that the 
crime was committed on <em>or about</em> a date named. Under such an allegation 
he is not required to prove any precise date but may prove any date which is not 
so remote as to surprise and prejudice the defendant. In case of surprise the 
court may allow an amendment of the information as to time and an adjournment to 
the accused, if necessary, to meet the amendment.</p>
<p>In the case of United States <em>vs.</em> De Castro (2 Phil Rep., 616), the 
information demurred to was as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The undersigned provincial fiscal accuses the defendant of the crime of 
bribery, committed as follows:</p>
<p>"That as municipal president of the town, in consideration of gifts of money, 
he permitted opium joints and gambling houses. This contrary to the 
law."</p></blockquote>
<p>Among the many defects of this information the court. pointed out the 
following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The complaint is also defective in not stating the time at which the offense 
occurred. While it is not necessary, unless time is a material ingredient of the 
offense, that the precise time of the commission of the offense should be 
stated, still the act should be alleged to have been committed at some time 
before the filing of the complaint."</p></blockquote>
<p>The decisions in the case of United States <em>vs.</em> Enriquez (1 Phil. 
Rep., 179), and United States vs. Cardona (1 Phil. Rep., 381), are not in 
conflict with the doctrine herein laid down, nor with the case of United States 
<em>vs. </em>De Castro from which the above quotation is made. In the first case 
the information alleged that the estafa complained of was committed on the 20th 
of November 1897. A demurrer was filed to the information on statutory grounds. 
It was over ruled and the defendant put upon trial. He was convicted and 
appealed to this court, bringing up on that appeal the questions arising on the 
order overruling the demurrer as well as on the merits. It is clear that the 
demurrer did not raise, so far as the information is concerned, the question of 
time, as in the case at bar, as the precise date upon which the crime was 
alleged to have been committed was set out in the information. The question 
presented to the Supreme Court was, therefore, not whether the information 
alleged the time with sufficient certainty. The question in that case was 
whether the allegations of the complaint sufficiently notified the defendant "of 
the transaction from which it is claimed the crime results, so that he can 
prepare his defense." The discussion in that case turned on whether the 
defendant, after reading the complaint, was, able to tell "to what acts of his 
done in the past the complaint refers." In determining that question the court 
discussed, among other things, the allegation with reference to the time when 
the estafa was committed. In that connection it was said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In this complaint the estafa is alleged to have been committed on November 
20, 1897. Time, however, was not a material ingredient in the offense of estafa 
here charged, and under the provisions of article 7 of General Orders, No. 58, 
that date need not have been alleged."</p></blockquote>
<p>After discussing the various elements of an information charging estafa 
necessary to identify the act which constitutes the crime, thereby notifying the 
defendant of the precise act of his complained of, the court concluded: "It is 
plain that the complaint did not restrict the Government to proof of any defined 
specific transaction, and consequently that the defendant had no notice of the 
transaction which was to be investigated."</p>
<p>In the Cardona case the theft of a carabao was alleged in the information to 
have taken place on the 25th of March of a certain year. The evidence introduced 
showed that the crime was committed on the 5th or 6th of March of the same year. 
The defendant in his brief claimed that the evidence introduced should have been 
restricted to the date mentioned in the information, or the 25th of March.</p>
<p>The court in response to this contention said: "The testimony as to the 
whereabouts of the defendant on March 25 was unimportant, as the evidence shows 
the robbery was committed about the 5th or 6th of March. The defendant in his 
brief claims that the evidence should be restricted to the date mentioned in the 
complaint, which was the 25th of March. In this case, however, the date was not 
a material ingredient of the offense, and under the provisions of section 7 of 
General Orders, No. 58, the Government was not limited in its proof to the date 
stated therein."</p>
<p>In these two cases, therefore, different questions are presented from those 
found in the case before us. In the first case the question of time as alleged 
in the information was discussed in an incidental way for the sole purpose of 
determining whether it of itself, or in connection with the other allegations, 
sufficiently identified the transaction which it was claimed constituted the 
estafa, so as to notify the defendant of the transaction referred to, the other 
allegations of the information not being sufficient of themselves to do so. In 
the Cardona case the question was raised by demurrer. The allegation in the 
information as to the time when the crime was committed was definite and 
certain. The only question raised on the appeal related to the alleged variance 
between the date of the crime as alleged in the information and that proved on 
the trial. In that case, as we have seen, the court said that, the time alleged 
not being, under section 7, a material ingredient of the offense, it did not 
have to be proved as laid. It did not hold that, if it had appeared to the trial 
court, on the trial, that the variance between the allegation of the information 
and the proof on the trial had been such as to surprise the defendant and 
prejudice him in his defense, the court would not have been authorized to amend 
the information and to grant an adjournment, if necessary, to give the defendant 
an opportunity to meet the charge as amended.</p>
<p>The same remarks apply to the case of United States <em>vs.</em> Arcos (11 
Phil. Rep., 555), where the information alleged "that between the 2d and the 
15th of August, 1906," the accused committed the crime described therein; and 
the case of United States <em>vs.</em> Smith (3 Phil. Rep., 20), in which the 
information charged "that the accused, in the month of December last," committed 
the crime therein set forth.<br><br>The question whether the allegations of the 
information are sufficiently definite as to time and the question which arises 
on a variance between the allegations and the proof are different in nature and 
legal effect, and are decided on different principles.<br><br>In the case before 
us the statement of the time when the crime is alleged to have been committed is 
so indefinite and uncertain that it does not give the accused the Information 
required by law. To allege in an information that the accused committed rape on 
a certain girl between October, 1910, and August, 1912, is too indefinite to 
give the accused an opportunity to prepare his defense, and that indefiniteness 
is not cured by setting out the date when a child was born as a result of such 
crime. Section 7 of the Code of Criminal Procedure does not warrant such 
pleading. Its purpose is to permit the allegation of a date of the commission of 
the crime as near to the actual date as the information of the prosecuting 
officer will permit, and when that has been done any date may be proved which 
does not surprise and substantially prejudice the defense. It does not authorize 
the total omission of a date or such an indefinite allegation with reference 
thereto as amounts to the same thing.</p>
<p>As before intimated, we are not to be understood as saying that a variance 
between the date of the commission of the crime as alleged in the information 
and that as proved on the trial warrants necessarily the acquittal of the 
accused. The result of what we intend to say is that, if such a variance occurs 
and it is shown to the trial court that the defendant is surprised thereby, and 
that, by reason of that surprise, he is unable to defend himself properly, the 
court may, in the exercise of sound discretion based on all the circumstances, 
order the information amended so as to set forth the correct date and may grant 
an adjournment for such a length of time as will enable the defendant to prepare 
himself to meet the variance in date which was the cause of his surprise.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J.,</em> and <em>Araullo, J.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em>Carson</em> and <em>Trent, JJ.,</em> concur in the result.</p>
<p><em>Order affirmed; demurrer sustained.<br></em></p></div>
