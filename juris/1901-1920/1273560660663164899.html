				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In the present case a protest was&nbsp; presented against the appraisement made by the Collector of Customs&nbsp; of certain goods, wares, and merchandise imported into the&nbsp; Philippine Islands by the plaintiff and appellee.&nbsp; The protest was disallowed and an appeal&nbsp; was taken to the&nbsp; Court of First Instance,&nbsp; where&nbsp; the judge&nbsp; proceeded&nbsp; to hear&nbsp; testimony concerning the wholesale value of said merchandise, and thereafter rendered&nbsp; a&nbsp; judgment in which he reversed the findings of the Collector of Customs and ordered the record returned, with direction to the Collector of Customs to fix the value&nbsp; of said merchandise in accordance with the declarations of the protestant.<br><br>From that judgment the Collector of Customs appealed to this court.<br><br>The simple question presented is whether or not the Collector of Customs is authorized to assess or appraise the true value&nbsp; of imported merchandise.&nbsp; In the present case there was&nbsp; no effort made to show that the&nbsp; Collector of Customs had proceeded upon a wrong principle and contrary to law. The proof tended to show simply that the value fixed by the Collector of Customs was not the real value of the merchandise.&nbsp; We have frequently&nbsp; decided that when the value of merchandise is&nbsp; fixed by&nbsp; the department of customs or the&nbsp; appraisers&nbsp; thereof and confirmed&nbsp; by the Insular Collector of Customs, such valuation is conclusive, in the&nbsp; absence of an affirmative showing that the appraiser, in fixing the value, proceeded upon a wrong principle and contrary to law.&nbsp; In reaching that conclusion we have followed&nbsp; the precedents established by the Supreme Court of the United States.&nbsp; (Lim Quim <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Collector of&nbsp; Customs, 23 Phil. Rep., 509; Lambert &amp; Co. <i>vs.</i> Collector of Customs, 25 Phil. Rep., 159; Behn, Meyer &amp; Co. <i>vs.</i> Collector of Customs, 26 Phil. Rep., 647; Kuenzle &amp; Streiff <i>vs.</i> Collector of Customs, 31 Phil. Rep., 465; Robertson <i>vs.</i> Frank Brothers Co., 132 U. S., 17; Auffmordt <i>vs.</i> Hedden, 137&nbsp; U. S., 310; Passavant&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> United States, 148 U. S.,&nbsp; 214; Muser <i>vs.</i> Magone, 155 U. S., 240.)<br><br>In view of the facts presented by the appellant, and the foregoing decisions, we are of the opinion and so hold that the judgment of the Court of First Instance should&nbsp; be and is hereby revoked.&nbsp; Let a judgment be&nbsp; entered in accordance with that conclusion, and, without any finding as to costs, it is&nbsp; so ordered.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Arellano,&nbsp; C.
