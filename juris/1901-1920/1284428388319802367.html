				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Paragraph 3 of article 14 [6] of Act No. 2587 provides for the licensing of 
chauffeurs. Paragraph 8 of said article provides for the punishment of any 
person who attempts to operate a motor vehicle without having procured a 
license. The punishment for violation of said law is a fine of not less than P25 
nor more than P200 for each offense, provided that if the vehicle so operated is 
for let or hire the penalty shall be a fine of not less than P25 nor more than 
P200, or imprisonment of not less than ten days nor more than thirty days, or 
both, in the discretion of the court for each offense.
<p>That the defendant and appellant was operating an automobile at the time and 
place mentioned in the complaint is admitted by him. That he had no license to 
operate motor vehicles is proved beyond question.</p>
<p>Therefore, the sentence of the lower court is hereby affirmed, with costs. So 
ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Carson, Araullo, Street</em>, and <em>Malcolm, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p></div>
