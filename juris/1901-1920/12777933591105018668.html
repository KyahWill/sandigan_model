				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The present action relates to the possession and ownership of a certain piece 
or parcel of land which is particularly described in paragraph 2 of the 
complaint.
<p>The action was commenced in the Court of First Instance of the Province of 
Laguna on the 28th day of August, 1913. The plaintiff alleged that he was the 
owner of said parcel of land; that the defendant was illegally interfering with 
his possession of the same; that prior to the commencement of the present action 
the defendant had presented a petition in the Court of Land Registration (Cause 
No. 8350) for the registration of said parcel of land in his name as 
administrator of the estate of Antonio Bueno, deceased; that the present 
plaintiff opposed the registration of said parcel of land, alleging that he was 
the owner of the same; that said cause was brought on for hearing in the Court 
of land Registration and was finally decided; that the Court of Land 
Registration, after hearing the evidence, reached the conclusion that the 
petitioner (the defendant herein) was not entitled to have said parcel of land 
registered; that said parcel of land belonged to the oppositor (the petitioner 
herein) ; that notwithstanding said decision of the Court of Land Registration 
the defendant herein continued molesting the plaintiff and interfering with his 
possession of said parcel of land.</p>
<p>The defendant answered said petition by a general denial.</p>
<p>Upon the issue thus presented, and after hearing the evidence, the Honorable 
Pedro Concepcion, judge, reached the conclusion that the plaintiff was the owner 
of said parcel of land; that he had purchased the same from Albino Villegas 
(Exhibit F) ; that Albino Villegas had acquired the title to said land by 
purchase from Petra Dionido (Exhibit E), and rendered a judgment in favor of the 
plaintiff and against the defendant in accordance with that conclusion, together 
with a judgment for damages in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant 
for the sum of P54, and costs.</p>
<p>From that decision the defendant appealed to this court and made several 
assignments of error.</p>
<p>In his first assignment of error he alleges that the lower court erred in 
admitting Exhibits E and F of the plaintiff. In support of said assignment of 
error the appellant alleges that said documents had not been properly identified 
and that their due execution and delivery had not been proved.</p>
<p>An examination of the evidence with reference to said Exhibits E and F shows 
that, at the time said exhibits were offered as proof, the defendant objected to 
their admissibility upon the ground that they were impertinent, immaterial and 
irrelevant; that the two exhibits were no more than ordinary papers. In reply to 
that objection the attorney for the plaintiff pointed out that said exhibits 
were public documents duly acknowledged before a notary public. The attorney for 
the defendant then made a further objection that they had not been properly 
identified. The court admitted said documents, and the attorney for the 
defendant duly excepted.</p>
<p>Said objection and exception present the questions: How may a document duly 
acknowledged under the hand and seal of a notary public be proved? Must the 
parties to said document be called as witnesses to prove its genuiness and 
authenticity? Must the witnesses to said document be called to show its 
execution and delivery? Must the notary public be summoned as a witness to prove 
the due acknowledgment of such document? Does not the certificate duly made 
under the hand and seal of the notary public make such document admissible in 
evidence without further proof of its execution and delivery? Is not a document 
acknowledged before a notary public under his hand and seal admissible in 
evidence as proof of its execution and delivery without additional proof of its 
identity and authenticity? Must the execution and delivery of documents 
acknowledged before a notary public under his hand and seal be proved the same 
as ordinary documents not so executed and delivered? If so, then, what is the 
advantage of having the execution and delivery of documents acknowledged before 
a notary public under his hand and seal?</p>
<p>No question was presented during the trial of the cause as to the verity of 
the acknowledgment under the hand and seal of the notary public to said Exhibits 
E and F.</p>
<p>The rule is well established that before private documents may be admitted in 
evidence as proof, their due execution and delivery must be proved. (Sec. 321, 
Act No. 190.) Their due execution and delivery may be proved (<em>a</em>) by any 
one who saw the document executed, or (<em>b</em>) by evidence of the 
genuineness of the handwriting of the maker, or (<em>c</em>) by a subscribing 
witness. (Sec. 324, Act No. 190.) There are certain statutory exceptions to the 
foregoing rule in this jurisdiction. (Sec. 326, Act No. 190.)</p>
<p>To the foregoing rules with reference to the method of proving private 
documents an exception is made with reference to the method of proving public 
documents executed before and certified to, under the hand and seal of certain 
public officials. The courts and legislatures have recognized the valid reason 
for such an exception. The litigation is unlimited in which testimony by 
officials is daily needed; the occasions in which the officials would be 
summoned from his ordinary duties to declare as a witness are numberless. The 
public officers are few in whose daily work something is not done in which 
testimony is not needed from official sources. Were there no exception for 
official statements, hosts of officials would be found devoting the greater part 
of their time to attending as witnesses in court or delivering their depositions 
before an officer. The work of administration of government and the interest of 
the public having business with officials would alike suffer in consequence. For 
these reasons, and for many others, a certain verity is accorded such documents, 
which is not extended to private documents. (3 Wigmore on Evidence, sec. 
1631.)</p>
<p>The law reposes a particular confidence in public officers that it presumes 
they will discharge their several trusts with accuracy and fidelity; and, 
therefore, whatever acts they do in discharge of their public duty may be given 
in evidence and shall be taken to be true under such a degree of caution as the 
nature and circumstances of each case may appear to require.</p>
<p>A notary public is sometimes spoken of as a public officer. (<em>Ley del 
Notariado de 15 de febrero de 1889; Ley del Notariado para las Islas 
Filipinas</em>). He is an officer known to the Law of Nations; hence his 
official acts receive credence, not only in his own country, but in all others 
in which they are used as instruments of evidence. (Kirksey <em>vs</em>. Bates, 
7 Porter (Ala.), 529; 31 Am. Dec, 722; Governor <em>vs.</em> Gordon, 15 Ala., 
72; Pierce <em>vs</em>. Indseth, 106 U. S., 546, 549; Greenleaf on Evidence, 
sec. 5; Townsley <em>vs.</em> Sumrail, 2 Peters (U. S.), 170.)</p>
<p>The functions of a notary public as a public or as a quasi-public officer has 
been recognized by the common law, the civil law as well as by the law of 
nations. He is recognized as a necessary official in nearly all the civilized 
countries. (Governor <em>vs</em>. Gordon, <em>supra</em>; Pierce <em>vs.</em> 
Indseth, <em>supra</em>; John's American Notaries, sec. 1.)</p>
<p>The notary public is recognized by the law merchant, and his official acts 
are received as evidence, not only in his own, but in all countries. His duties 
are, often, of great variety and importance, consisting for the most part, in 
protesting inland and foreign bills of exchange, promissory notes, etc. Also the 
authentication of transfer to property, administering the oath as to the 
correctness of accounts or statements of important documents, which are often 
necessary for transmission to points where the parties directly in interest are 
unable to appear in person. The taking of depositions for actions pending in 
foreign or distant courts. The taking of the affidavits of mariners and masters 
of ships, their protests, etc., requiring care and judgment. In all such cases 
the notary's certificate or jurat, when accompanied with his official seal of 
office and proper certificates of his official character if the act is to be 
used beyond his own county or State, is received as <em>prima fade</em> 
evidence. (John's American Notaries, sec. 1.)</p>
<p>All documents acknowledged by a notary public and certified to by him are 
considered public documents in this jurisdiction. (Art. 1216, Civil Code; 
Gochuico <em>vs</em>. Ocampo, 7 Phil. Rep., 15.)</p>
<p>The principal function of a notary public is to authenticate documents. When 
a notary public certifies the due execution and delivery of a document under his 
hand and seal he thereby gives such a document the force of evidence. (29 Cyc, 
1076; Bradley <em>vs</em>. Northern Bank, 60 Ala., 252.)</p>
<p>Section 331 of Act No. 190 provides that, "every instrument conveying or 
affecting real property situated in the Philippine Islands, acknowledged or 
proved and certified as provided by law prevailing in the Philippine Islands, 
may, together with the certificate of the acknowledgment or proof, be read in 
evidence in an action or proceeding without further proof."</p>
<p>Indeed, one of the very purposes of requiring documents to be acknowledged 
before a notary public, in addition to the solemnity which should surround the 
execution and delivery of documents, is to authorize such documents to be given 
in evidence without further proof of their execution and delivery. (John's 
American Notaries, section 168; Bowman <em>vs</em>. Wettig, 39 111., 416; 
Harrington <em>vs</em>. Fish, 10 Mich., 415.)</p>
<p>Our conclusions is, therefore, with reference to the first assignment of 
error, that a document duly acknowledged before a notary public under his hand 
and seal, with his certificate thereto attached, is admissible in evidence 
without further proof of its due execution and delivery, unless and until some 
question is raised as to the verity of said acknowledgment and certificate.</p>
<p>What has been said with reference to the first assignment of error, we 
believe, also answers the contention of the appellant in his second assignment 
of error.</p>
<p>The appellant contends that the lower court committed an error in admitting 
Exhibit G (G-1). Said exhibit is the record of the Court of Land Registration in 
an action in which the present defendant was the petitioner and the present 
plaintiff was the oppositor. While the appellant does not say so, the inference 
is that his objection is based upon the ground that said exhibit had not been 
identified by the custodian of said document. By section 18 of Act No. 2347, the 
clerks of the courts of the respective provinces or districts are <em>ex 
officio</em> deputies of the Chief of the General Land Registration Office, and, 
as such, may identify records made up in the Courts of First Instance relating 
to the registration of land under the Torrens system. By virtue of said Act, the 
clerk of the Court of First Instance, being <em>ex officio</em> deputy of the 
Chief of the General Land Registration Office, was fully authorized to identify 
said record, being the custodian thereof.</p>
<p>With reference to the other assignments of error, we find nothing in the 
record which would justify a modification of the decision of the lower court 
based thereon.</p>
<p>A careful examination of the record shows that the plaintiff is the owner and 
entitled to the peaceable and quiet possession of the land in question. 
Therefore, the judgment of the lower court is hereby affirmed, with costs. So 
ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Carson, Araullo, Street,</em> and <em>Malcolm, 
JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
