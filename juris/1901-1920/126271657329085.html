				<H3>HIGINIO  FRANCISCO YUNTI, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. THE CHINAMAN, DY-YCO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Higinio Francisco Yunti,  in  his amended  complaint filed in this case prayed the court that judgment be entered against the Chinaman Dy-Yco, declaring that the plaintiff is entitled to recover from the defendant:  (1)  The sum of 3,700 pesos, Philippine currency, as an indemnification for the breach of the contract of lease  in question at the rate of 50 pesos  for each  unexpired month which the lease had yet to run  from the 4th of August, 1905, to the 4th of October, 1911;  (2)  the sum of 2,000 pesos for damages caused to the property during his occupation thereof; and (3)  the sum of 500 pesos spent by the plaintiff in  the various litigations instituted as a result of the breach of the contract; and further asked that such other relief be granted him as the court deemed just and equitable.</p>
<p>The defendant demurred to  this  complaint upon  the following grounds: (1)  That the court had no jurisdiction of the subject-matter for the reason that the plaintiff in this case seeks to recover damages upon a judgment rendered in a justice court in an action to recover the possession of the, property in question, whereas, the two causes of action are inseparable; (2)  that there  was  another action pending between the same parties for the same cause inasmuch as the breach  of the contract which constitutes the cause of action alleged in  this case was  the basis of the action brought in the justice court of this city;  (3) that the facts alleged in the complaint do not constitute a cause of action; and (4) that the complaint is ambiguous1, unintelligible, and uncertain, because it does not specify the different grounds upon which are based the claims for indemnification, and there being various remedies prayed for,  the  grounds assigned are  confusedly  set  forth; and asked the court  to sustain his demurrer with costs against the plaintiff.</p>
<p>The court made an order on the 14th of October, 1905, sustaining the  demurrer,  dismissing the complaint, and directing that the defendant recover from the plaintiff the costs of the proceedings.</p>
<p>The plaintiff  excepted  to this ruling of the court and subsequently presented his bill of exceptions,  which was approved and sent to this court.  It appears that the plaintiff and appellant filed his printed brief in this court, but the appellee has failed to file a reply thereto.</p>
<p>An examination of the complaint and the nature of the prayer thereof shows that the order of the court is not in conformity with the law.</p>
<p>The complaint filed in this case has for its object, not to recover  the possession of the  property as sought in the action brought in the justice  court, but to  recover the damages and the expenses incurred by the plaintiff.   The statement made by the court below in the order appealed from to  the effect that the property recovered as a result of a certain  action  for  ejectment  is the same property sought to be recovered in this case,  together with the rent due and to become due in the year  1911 at the rate of 50 pesos per month, is therefore erroneous.</p>
<p>If it were true, as stated  by the court  below, that the defendant is guilty of a breach  of the said lease as a result of his failure to pay the rent due, the greater is the reason why the action should have been permitted to  continue. It is not  proper in a case like this to  dismiss the complaint, thereby preventing the filing of an answer setting forth the defense in full and preventing the proceedings from being carried on to their end without any legal reason therefor.</p>
<p>The lease having been terminated as a result of the final judgment rendered in the action for ejectment, there yet remains  to be discussed the consequences of  the breach of such contract, for which said breach the party responsible therefor  is undoubtedly the only one liable.   That liability may be translated into indemnification for  damages and this is what the plaintiff seeks to recover in his complaint, and not  the rent due or  to become due for the use of the property as erroneously stated in the order appealed from. The question  as to whether the defendant,  after the rescission of the lease, was bound by the terms thereof and is also liable for damages as alleged, should be discussed in a separate action  and settled by a final judgment  in accordance with the evidence submitted by  both  parties. Article 1106 of the Civil Code provides:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Indemnity for losses and damages includes not only the amount of the loss which may have been suffered, but also that of the profit which the creditor may have failed to realize, reserving the provisions contained in the following articles."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Article 1556 of the same code  provides:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"If the lessor or lessee should not comply with the obligations mentioned in the .preceding articles, they may request the rescission of the contract and indemnity for losses and damages, or only the latter, leaving the contract in force."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The lessee must return the property at the expiration of the lease in the  same condition in which he received  it, except what may have been destroyed or impaired by time or by unavoidable causes.   (Art. 1561 of the Civil Code.)</p>
<p>From the terms of the complaint and the prayers therein contained, it clearly appears that the facts therein alleged give rise to an  undoubted  cause of action based upon the provisions. of the law,' and it  further  appears  that the present action had  for its  object the  recovery of the damages  specified  upon the different grounds set put in the complaint.   Therefore the order of the court below sustaining the demurrer to the complaint has no legal foundation and should be reversed.</p>
<p>For the reasons hereinbefore stated  the order of the court dated October 14,1905, is hereby reversed.   Let this decision be communicated to the judge of the Court of First Instance so that he  may direct the defendant to answer the complaint within ten days and proceed with the trial of the case in accordance with the law; without  special condemnation as to costs.   After the expiration of twenty days from the date hereof,  let judgment be entered in accordance herewith, and ten days thereafter the records  be remanded  to the Court of First Instance for proper action.  So ordered.</p>
