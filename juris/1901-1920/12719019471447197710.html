				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">At about&nbsp; 11 p. m. on the 15th of October, 1908, Macario Labitoria, asleep in his house situated in the barrio of Dumuit, town&nbsp; of Tayabas, in the province of the same name, was awakened by some one on the outside calling him by name; he got up and opened the window to see who it was, and saw standing&nbsp; in&nbsp; front of his house two&nbsp; individuals who asked him to allow them to pass the night in the house; he thereupon struck a light and&nbsp; opened the door at&nbsp; the top of the staircase, and inquired who they were, to which one of the men&nbsp; answered that his name was Miguel.&nbsp; At this moment, as the owner of the house, the lieutenant of the barrio, sought to recognize the stranger, another man, who was already&nbsp; upstairs alongside the staircase, struck Labitoria on the forehead with a wooden stick;&nbsp; as a result of the attack, the latter fell backward over a bench inside the house, and the aggressor, who turned out to be Toribio Abanto, passed&nbsp; through the door and threw himself upon Labitoria, seizing him by the throat; at this, Urbano Quiambao, who was staying in the house that&nbsp; night, seeing what was taking&nbsp; place, caught up a stick of <i>palma brava </i>which he used for&nbsp; carrying his stock of drygoods, and struck&nbsp; the aggressor with it.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result of the struggle that&nbsp; ensued between&nbsp; the three, Toribio Abanto fell wounded&nbsp; to&nbsp; the ground, and after some time he was picked up by order of the justice of the peace, to whom Marcos Labitoria reported the affair, and the wounded aggressor was&nbsp; carried in a hammock to the town.<br><br>For&nbsp; these reasons the provincial fiscal filed a complaint on the 11th of&nbsp; February, 1909, with the Court of First Instance of Lucena, charging Toribio Abanto with the crime of forcible&nbsp; entry of a&nbsp; dwelling.&nbsp; Proceedings were instituted, and the trial judge entered judgment on the same date, sentencing&nbsp; the defendant to the penalty of five years of <i>prision correccional,</i> to the accessory penalties, to pay a fine of 1,000 pesetas, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and costs.&nbsp; From the said judgment the&nbsp; defendant has&nbsp; appealed.<br><br>Article 491 of the Penal Code reads :<br><blockquote>"Any private individual who shall enter another's dwelling against the will of the tenant thereof shall be punished with <i>arresto mayor</i> and a fine of from 325 to 3,250 pesetas.<br><br>"If the deed were committed with violence&nbsp; or intimidation, the penalties shall be <i>prision correctional</i> in its medium and maximum degree and a fine of from 325 to 3,250 pesetas."</blockquote>The facts related and&nbsp; fully proven in the present&nbsp; case constitute the crime of forcible entry of a dwelling, defined and punished by paragraph 2 of the foregoing article, inasmuch, as on the night in question the defendant forcibly entered the house of Macario Labitoria; taking advantage of the fact that the house owner opened the door and put his head outside to ascertain who were the two persons&nbsp; that were asking shelter, Abanto suddenly, and without reason, struck Labitoria a heavy blow on the forehead&nbsp; with a stick (<i>garrote</i>) and when the&nbsp; assaulted man fell over a bench inside his house,&nbsp; the&nbsp; aggressor passed through the open door and repeated the assault, grasping the latter, who had fallen over said bench, by the neck.&nbsp; Thanks to the assistance rendered&nbsp; by the guest, Urbano Quiambao, Labitoria fared no worse, nor was the accused Abanto, as prearranged with his two companions&nbsp; who remained outside the house, able to accomplish his ulterior purpose,&nbsp; It is probable that the latter did not dare enter the house upon hearing or observing the effective defense&nbsp; offered by the owner of the house and his guest, Quiambao.<br><br>The circumstance that the door of the house was already open and that there was&nbsp; no&nbsp; previous express opposition or prohibition on the part of the owner thereof to the entry of the defendant is no bar to the qualification of the crime; in order that the crime of forcible entry of a dwelling may be considered&nbsp; as&nbsp; having&nbsp; been&nbsp; perpetrated,&nbsp; it is not an essential requisite that the door of the house should be closed; even if it were open, so long as the entry of a person is&nbsp; opposed or prohibited by the tenant, the crime is committed if said individual introduces himself therein against the express will of its tenant.<br><br>Paragraph 2 of the above-cited article&nbsp; is applicable&nbsp; in this case, it having been fully proven that the defendant Abanto entered the house of the injured party in a violent manner, and&nbsp; assaulted&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter from the&nbsp; door to the interior of his house, and in view of such behavior it is not necessary that&nbsp; express opposition or prohibition on the part of the tenant should have preceded the forcible entry.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even in a semicivilized country it must be supposed that a person entering a house&nbsp; with violence and maltreating the tenant, as stated herein before, would not obtain the tacit nor express consent of the latter.<br><br>The defendant pleaded not guilty,&nbsp; and,&nbsp; notwithstanding his allegations, not only unsupported by proof, but notoriously false and contrary to his own&nbsp; testimony in another case instituted&nbsp; against Mateo Lacuarin and Isaac de Ocampo, who accompanied him on the night in question,&nbsp; these proceedings furnish evidence conclusive&nbsp; beyond all reasonable doubt of his guilt as the sole principal of the crime herein prosecuted.&nbsp; In the proceedings alluded to, brought against said persons for attempted robbery, the defendant Abanto testified that by order of&nbsp; the latter, he called&nbsp; to the injured party from the street and asked him for lodging,&nbsp; and that when the door of the house was opened, he being near it, was at once maltreated&nbsp; by&nbsp; the inmates of the same, and not by&nbsp; reason of the gambling that was going on therein; Ms testimony&nbsp; in these proceedings is, therefore, false, being not only contrary to his former allegation, but contradicted by the&nbsp; injured party and his house companion.<br><br>In the commission oi the crime herein the trial judge has rightly&nbsp; considered&nbsp; the&nbsp; aggravating circumstance of nocturnity, for the reason that it was perpetrated at a late hour&nbsp; and in the&nbsp; silence&nbsp; of night, without any mitigating circumstance to lessen its effects.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; penalty of<i> prision correccional in</i>&nbsp; its medium and maximum degrees, as fixed by the code, should be imposed upon&nbsp; him in the maximum degree.<br><br>For the foregoing" reasons, and as the judgment appealed from is in accordance with the&nbsp; law and the merits of the case, it is our opinion that the same should be and is hereby affirmed, with the costs against the appellant.&nbsp; So ordered,<br><br><i> Arellano, C. J., Mapa, Johnson, Carson,</i> and Moreland, JJ., concur.<br></div>
