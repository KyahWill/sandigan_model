				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">It appears from the record that the prosecuting attorney of the Province of 
Misamis, on the 2d day of October, 1917, presented a complaint against the 
defendant charging him with a violation of section 2672 of Act No. 2711 (of the 
crime of embezzlement). Upon that complaint the defendant was duly arrested, 
arraigned and, having plead not guilty, placed on trial. At the close of the 
presentation of proof by the prosecuting attorney, the attorney for the 
defendant presented a motion praying that the action be dismissed. Said motion 
is in the following words:
<blockquote><p>"Before proceeding, counsel for the defense presents a motion praying the 
court for the acquittal of the accused in this case. It is alleged in the 
information that the said accused, as postmaster and telegraph operator of the 
post and telegraph office of the said municipality had, as such, under his 
control and responsibility, the funds of the said office, which funds belong to 
the Government of the Philippine Islands. The question which we submit for 
decision is whether a certain amount delivered to the postmaster without any 
documentary proof that this amount had been received, thus forming a part of the 
funds belonging to the Government, will make this postmaster liable for 
malversation."</p></blockquote>
<p>Upon a consideration of said motion, the Honorable John P. Weissenhagen, 
judge, granted the same and dismissed the defendant, with costs <span style="font-style: italic;">de offlcio</span>.</p>
<p>Upon the announcement of said decision, the prosecuting attorney presented a 
motion praying that the defendant be retried under a complaint charging the 
proper offense, which motion the court granted, basing his decision upon 
sections 27 and 37 of General Orders No. 58 and the decision of the Supreme 
Court in the cases of the United States vs. Balmori (1 Phil. Rep., 660) and the 
United States <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Sarabia (4 Phil. Rep., 566). Against the order granting said 
motion of the prosecuting attorney, the defendant duly excepted.</p>
<p>On the 3d day of October, 1917, the prosecuting attorney presented a new 
complaint charging the defendant with the crime of <span style="font-style: italic;">estafa</span>.</p>
<p>An examination of the two complaints will show that each alleges 
substantially the same facts. The title of the first complaint stated that the 
defendant had violated section 2672 of Act No. 2711. Said article describes the 
crime of embezzlement. The title of the second complaint stated that the 
defendant was charged with the crime of <span style="font-style: italic;">estafa</span>. An examination of the two 
complaints shows:</p>
<blockquote><p>"(<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) That the defendant on or about the 25th day of October, 1916, was 
postmaster and telegraph operator of the Bureau of Posts, in the municipality of 
Plaridel of the Province of Misamis; (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) that on said day he received from one 
Yap Tiao Que the sum of P30 to be sent by telegram to the Universal Film Company 
of Manila, and the additional sum of P4.90 to pay the costs of transmission of 
said P30; (<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>) that instead of transmitting by telegram the said P30 to the 
Universal Film Company at Manila, he appropriated the same, together with the 
P4.90 to his own use."</p></blockquote>
<p>Upon the second complaint the defendant was again arraigned upon the 4th day 
of October, 1917, and plead not guilty. Later, and on the same day (October 4r 
1917), the defendant demurred to the complaint upon the ground that the facts 
alleged therein did not constitute a crime, which demurrer was overruled on the 
same day. Thereupon, and on the same day (October 4, 1917), the cause was 
brought on for trial.</p>
<p>The only objection made to the second complaint at the time of arraignment 
was that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.</p>
<p>By agreement, at the beginning of the second trial, the evidence which had 
been presented by the prosecuting attorney in the first trial was presented and 
admitted as proof. At the close of the second trial, and after hearing and 
considering the evidence, the Honorable John P. Weissenhagen found the defendant 
guilty of the crime of <span style="font-style: italic;">estafa</span> and sentenced him to suffer imprisonment for a 
period of two months and one day of <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span>, to reimburse the offended 
person in the sum of P34.90 and to pay the costs. From that sentence, the 
defendant appealed to this court.</p>
<p>No defense of former jeopardy was presented. That defense, therefore, cannot 
now be considered, having been presented, for the first time, in this court. It 
has been held, in numerous cases, by this court, that if an objection is not 
made in the trial court in a criminal action, it will not be considered when 
made in the appellate court for the first time. (U. S. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Sarabia, 4 Phil. 
Rep., 566; Mortiga <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Serra and Oblena, 5 Phil. Rep., 34 [204 U. S., 470] ; U. 
S. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Paraiso, 5 Phil. Rep., 149 [207 U. S., 368] ; U. S. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Flores, 9 Phil 
Rep., 47; U. S. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Planas, 21 Phil. Rep., 90; U. S. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Gow Chiong, 23 Phil. 
Rep., 138; U. S. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Gardell, 23 Phil. Rep., 207; U. S. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. De los Santos, 33 
Phil. Rep., 397.)</p>
<p>The plea of former jeopardy or <span style="font-style: italic;">autrefois</span> acquit and convict are defenses 
which must be plead at the time of the arraignment and it is too late to present 
the same as a defense on an appeal. (U. S. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Wilson, 7 Peters [U. S.], 150.) 
The right to interpose the plea of former jeopardy may be waived. (<span style="font-style: italic;">Ex parte</span> 
Lange, 18 Wallace [U. S.], 163; U. S. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Ball, 163 U. S., 662; Murphy <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. 
Mass., 177 U. S., 155; Hopt <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Utah, 114 U. S., 488; Trono <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. U. S., 199 U. 
S., 521 [3 Phil. Rep., 213].)</p>
<p>The appellant alleges that the evidence adduced during the trial of the case 
was insufficient to show that he was guilty of the crime described in the 
complaint. The lower court, in both its first and second decision, arrived at 
the conclusion that the defendant had received the P34.90 in the manner and form 
described in the complaint.</p>
<p>From an examination of the evidence, we find that the conclusion of the lower 
court is fully established beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>It having been proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant had 
committed the act described in each of the complaints, the question arises; What 
crime, if any, did he commit? the first complaint qualified said act as the 
crime of embezzlement. The second complaint qualified said act as constituting 
the crime of <span style="font-style: italic;">estafa</span>. The Attorney-General, in a very carefully prepared brief, 
reached the conclusion that the crime described in the body of the complaint 
constituted the crime of embezzlement and recommended that the sentence of the 
lower court be modified, and that the penalty provided for the crime of 
embezzlement be imposed upon the defendant.</p>
<p>It will be remembered that the defendant was the postmaster and telegraph 
operator in the municipality of Plaridel, Province of Misamis, an employee of 
the Bureau of Posts, and as such telegraph operator it was his duty, when so 
requested, to receive money for transmission by telegram.</p>
<p>The record shows that it was the custom and the requirement of the Bureau of 
Posts, when money was so received by telegraph operators, to issue receipts or 
some evidence of having received money for the purpose of being transmitted by 
telegram. In the present case, no receipt or voucher was issued and the 
appellant argues, for that reason, that he is not guilty of the crime of 
embezzlement. The proof shows, beyond question, that he received the P34.90 for 
the purposes above indicated. His failure to issue a receipt or other evidence 
is not sufficient to overcome the positive proof that he did, in fact, receive 
said money. When he received the money for transmission it became a part of the 
public funds, and the telegram, which it was his duty to send, was simply an 
order that the Bureau of Posts should pay it out of the public funds at its 
disposal in Manila, as directed by the offended party. The money, immediately 
upon receipt, became a part of the public funds of the Bureau of Posts and, of 
course, had to be accounted for as a part of the receipts and disbursements of 
public funds. He had authority to receive said money by virtue of his official 
position and failed to account for the same but, on the contrary, appropriated 
said sum to his own use and failed and refused to account therefor when demand 
upon him was so made.</p>
<p>We are clearly of the opinion that the crime described in the body of the 
complaint is the crime of embezzlement and not of <span style="font-style: italic;">estafa</span>. We have decided in 
numerous cases that the qualification of a crime given by the prosecuting 
attorney in the title of a complaint does not control the qualification of the 
crime as described in the body of the complaint. (U. S. <em>vs</em>. Supila, 13 
Phil. Rep., 671; U. S. <em>vs</em>. Treyes, 14 Phil. Rep., 270; U. S. 
<em>vs</em>. Jeffrey, 15 Phil. Rep., 391; Davis <em>vs</em>. Director of 
Prisons, 17 Phil. Rep., 168, 172; U. S. <em>vs</em>. Lim San, 17 Phil. Rep., 
273; U. S. <em>vs</em>. De Guzman, 19 Phil. Rep., 350; U. S. <em>vs</em>. Campo, 
23 Phil. Rep., 368, 371; U. S. <em>vs</em>. Guzman, 25 Phil. Rep., 22; U. S. 
<em>vs</em>. Panlilio, 28 Phil. Rep., 608, 615; U. S. <em>vs</em>. Lafuente, 37 
Phil. Rep., 671.)</p>
<p>The record shows that, by virtue of the official position of the defendant, 
he was authorized to receive the money in question; that he was dealing with 
money which, at least, had become impressed with public attributes or character; 
that the defendant was at least, by virtue of his official position, accountable 
to the government for the funds received. He was accountable to the government 
for said money. (U. S. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Regala, 28 Phil. Rep., 57.)</p>
<p>We fully agree with the recommendation of the Attorney-General that the 
defendant is guilty of the crime of embezzlement, and that that is the crime 
described in the complaint and not the crime of <span style="font-style: italic;">estafa</span>.</p>
<p>Therefore, the sentence of the lower court must be revoked, and it is hereby 
ordered and decreed that the appellant be sentenced to be imprisoned for a 
period of six months and to pay a fine of P34.90, to indemnify the offended 
party in the sum of P34.90, or to suffer subsidiary imprisonment in case of 
insolvency and to pay the costs. (U. S. <em>vs</em>. Velasquez, 33 Phil. Rep., 
368; U. S. <em>vs</em>. Lafuente, 37 Phil. Rep., 671.)</p>
<p>And it is hereby further ordered and decreed that he be further sentenced 
with the accessory penalty provided for by Act No. 1740 and its amendment. So 
ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Street, Malcolm, Avanceña</em>, and <em>Fisher, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p></div>
