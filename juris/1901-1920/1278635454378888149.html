				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">These defendants were charged with the crime of the illegal importation of 
opium, in violation of Article 341 of Act 355. Upon said complaint they were 
duly arrested, arraigned, tried and found guilty of the crime charged, and each 
was sentenced to be imprisoned for a period of six months and to pay a fine of 
P500.00, and in case of insolvency to suffer subsidiary imprisonment, and each 
to pay one-half the costs. From that sentence the defendant, Pedro Sioco 
appealed to this court.<br><p><br>The only question presented by the appellant in 
this court is one of fact. He alleges that the evidence adduced during the trial 
of the cause was not sufficient to show that he was guilty of the crime 
charged.</p>
<p>The complaint alleges that on or about the 11th lay of March, 1914, in the 
City of Manila, Philippine Islands, the said accused did then and there 
knowingly, wilfully, illegally, criminally and fraudulently import and bring 
into the said City of Manila, Philippine Islands, from a foreign country, on the 
steamship "Manchuria", contrary to law, eight hundred grams of morphine, a 
derivative of opium and a prohibited drug; that said aused did then and there 
receive, conceal and facilitate the transportation of said eight hundred grams 
of morphine, after its importation into the Philippine Islands from a foreign 
country, knowing the same to have "been imported contrary to law.</p>
<p>An examination of the evidence brought to this court shows, beyond a 
reasonable doubt, that the defendant is guilty of the crime charged in the 
complaint. Therefore the sentence of the lower court ie hereby affirmed, with 
costs.</p>
<p>It is so ordered.</p>
<p>After the expiration of 10 days from the date hereof, let Judgment be entered 
in accordance herewith, and 10 days thereafter let the record be returned to the 
court from whence it came, for execution.<br></p></div>
