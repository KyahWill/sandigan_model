				G.R. No. 6504, September 11, 1911</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF  AND APPELLEE, VS. DIONISIO TAPAN AND RUFINA DE LEON, DEFENDANTS.  DIONISIO TAPAN, APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">These defendants were charged with the larceny of three carabaos, the property of Matias&nbsp; Yusay.&nbsp; Rufina de Leon was sick and unable to appear&nbsp; at the trial.&nbsp; The trial&nbsp; of the cause proceeded against the defendant Dionisio Tapan alone.<p>After hearing the evidence, the lower court found the defendant (Dionisio Tapan) guilty of the crime charged&nbsp; in the complaint and&nbsp; sentenced him, under the provisions&nbsp; of paragraph 2 of article 518, in&nbsp; relation with&nbsp; paragraph 1 of article 517 of the Penal Code, to be imprisoned for a period of four years of <em>presidio&nbsp; correccional,</em> and to pay&nbsp; to Matias Yusay the sum of P150, the value of the two carabaos not recovered, and in case of insolvency to suffer subsidiary imprisonment, and to pay the costs.</p><p>From that sentence the defendant appealed to this court.</p><p>From an examination of the evidence, the following facts appear:</p><p>That Matias Yusay was the owner of&nbsp; three carabaos in the month of March, 1907, which&nbsp; were then in the possession of his tenant, Eugenio Puentespino; that in the&nbsp; night time during the said month of March these carabaos were stolen; that the carabaos were kept in an enclosure under the house occupied by the tenant; that the gate to the enclosure was locked by some form of a lock on the inside of the gate and that when the gate was once locked, the customary way to enter the said enclosure was by means of a ladder or stairway going up into the house from the said enclosure; that on the morning after the carabaos were stolen it was found that the gate&nbsp; to the enclosure had been broken open.</p><p>About two&nbsp; years and a half (November 22,&nbsp; 1909)&nbsp; after the carabaos&nbsp; had been stolen, as above described, one&nbsp; of them, which was fully identified by Matias Yusay, was found in&nbsp; the&nbsp; possession of the defendant, Dionisio Tapan.&nbsp; He gave no satisfactory explanation of his&nbsp; possession of said carabao; he produced no witnesses to show how he came into the possession of the carabao.&nbsp; Men who&nbsp; come&nbsp; into the lawful possession of property seldom&nbsp; ever have any difficulty in explaining the source of their possession.&nbsp; In the absence of a satisfactory&nbsp; explanation and under the presumption&nbsp; of law&gt; the lower court found the defendant guilty of the crime charged,&nbsp; (U. S. <em>vs.</em>Soriano,&nbsp; 9 Phil. Rep., 441.)</p><p>The crime was committed at night and in an&nbsp; inhabited house.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; is&nbsp; believed&nbsp; that the enclosure under the house in the form in which it was maintained in the present case should be considered as a part of the house, in accordance with the provisions of&nbsp; article 510 of the Penal Code.&nbsp; Said article 510 provides that -&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"Any lodging&nbsp; that shall constitute the dwelling&nbsp; place of one or more persons&nbsp; shall be considered an inhabited house, even though they should accidentally be absent therefrom when the robbery took&nbsp; place,"</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"As&nbsp; the&nbsp; dependencies of an inhabited house or public building or one dedicated to religious worship, shall be considered&nbsp; its courts, corrals, shops, granaries, mews, stables, stalls, and other&nbsp; divisions or enclosures&nbsp; contiguous to the building, having interior connection&nbsp; therewith, so that the same constitute one entire place."&nbsp; (Viada, 3d Supplement, 377, decision of the supreme court of Spain of January 4, 1898.)</p></blockquote><p>The&nbsp; circumstance of nocturnity and&nbsp; the fact that the theft was committed in an inhabited house should be considered as aggravating circumstances.&nbsp; There were no extenuating circumstances.&nbsp; The defendant should therefore be punished in the maximum degree of the penalty provided by law.&nbsp; The&nbsp; penalty of the lower court was imposed in the&nbsp; maximum degree;&nbsp; the lower&nbsp; court failed, however, to&nbsp; impose the accessory penalty&nbsp; provided for&nbsp; in&nbsp; article 58 of the Penal Code.&nbsp; The judgment of the lower court is therefore hereby affirmed, with the addition that the defendant&nbsp; be&nbsp; sentenced to suffer the&nbsp; accessory penalty&nbsp; of said article 58, with costs.&nbsp; So ordered.</p><p><em> Torres, Mapa,</em> and <em>Carson, JJ.</em>, concur.</p><p><em> Moreland, J.,</em> dissents.</p></div>
