				<BR><BR><div align="justify">It appears from the evidence in this case that on or about April 1, 1915, 
Leon Raneses was murdered in the municipality of Sinait, in the Province of 
Ilocos Sur, under the following circumstances: Clemente Gampona, being moved by 
the desire to possess the wife and the property of Raneses, induced Valentin 
Yacas, Liberto Tumbaga, Tomas Mangrubang, and Roman Guillermo to kill him for a 
reward to be paid in money. In order to accomplish the work with the least 
possible danger of discovery, it was decided that the intended victim should be 
lured to a wild, remote, and uninhabited place in the mountains. To this end he 
was invited to go with these four men to a place called Pittao upon the pretense 
that they would there find a molave tree from which flowed <em>bulbulong</em>, a 
mysterious liquid supposed to have the virtue of making the man who possessed it 
irresistible to women. By prearrangement the party met late in the evening on 
the date mentioned above at a hut situated in a field of Tomas Mangrubang. To 
this place the deceased was brought by Liberto Tumbaga; and there these two 
found their three companions ready for the journey. The party proceeded on its 
way, but after they had climbed some distance up Mount Camiding they decided to 
stop for the night. When Raneses had fallen asleep the assassins, who had 
remained awake, arose and proceeded to their work. Valentin Yacas struck the 
deceased in the forehead with a hatchetâ€”a blow which necessarily would have been 
fatal. Roman Guillermo then struck him in the right side and Tomas Mangrubang 
struck him in the left side with the sharp edge of the same instrument, 
inflicting other wounds of a serious nature. When the victim was dead the body 
was buried in the bed of a dry stream nearby, and the murderers returned to 
their homes. Within a short period they were paid the reward which had been 
promised by Clemente Gampona, being P160 in money. This money was divided among 
the four.
<p>The accused in this proceeding are Clemente Gampona, Tomas Mangruban, and 
Roman Guillermo. Another of the four agents in this murder, Liberto Tumbaga, was 
joined in the complaint but asked for a severance and was not tried in this 
case.</p>
<p>The principal witness for the prosecution was Valentin Yacas, who admitted 
that he himself struck the first blow. Nevertheless as he made the fullest and 
most complete declaration of the circumstances of the tragedy, at the time of 
the preliminary examination, the prosecuting authorities decided to use him as 
their witness. To this end they procured a dismissal as to him before the 
justice of the peace; and his name does not appear in the complaint in the 
present action. This circumstance does not affect the admissibility of his 
testimony.</p>
<p>The testimony given by Valentin Yacas is consistent and in our opinion was 
not discredited by other testimony. On the contrary it is confirmed in material 
particulars by sundry admissions and confessions of each of the accused, made at 
or about the time of the preliminary examination. As a result of these 
confessions, and under the guidance of some of the actors in this tragedy, human 
bones were found at or near the place where the body of the deceased had been 
buried; and there can be no doubt that these formed part of the skeleton of the 
deceased.</p>
<p>In the light of the proof adduced in this case there appears no room to doubt 
the guilt of all of the defendants.</p>
<p>There were present in this case the aggravating circumstances of craft, 
alevosia, evident premeditation, and that the crime was committed in an 
uninhabited place. (Subsections 2, 7, 8, 15 of section 10.) The circumstance of 
nocturnity in this case is sufficiently estimated in the circumstance of 
alevosia and need not be considered. It is also evident that the aggravating 
circumstances of craft, evident premeditation, and the commission of the crime 
in an uninhabited place are involved to some extent with each other; and upon 
close analysis it would probably be found that the number of these aggravating 
circumstances could be reduced. For instance, it might be argued that evident 
premeditation is sufficiently estimated in craft and the commission of the crime 
for a reward. However, it is obvious that no benefit would result to these 
defendants as a result of such process, for the aggravating elements are so 
pronounced and numerous that it would be impossible under the circumstances of 
this case to reduce the penalty below the maximum prescribed for the crime of 
murder.</p>
<p>Ignorance and lack of education is conceded as a mitigating circumstance in 
favor of Tomas Mangrubang and Roman Guillermo, under article 11, as amended. But 
this circumstance also is not sufficient in our estimation to reduce the penalty 
below the maximum prescribed for the crime of murder. This also was the finding 
of the trial judge, who imposed upon the three defendants the penalty of death. 
In this we think there was no error.</p>
<p>For the reasons stated the judgment under review must be affirmed, with costs 
of this instance against the defendants. The penalty of death shall be executed 
at a time to be fixed by the trial court and in all respects in accordance with 
law. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Johnson, Carson, Araullo</em>, and <em>Malcolm, 
JJ</em>., concur.</p></div>
