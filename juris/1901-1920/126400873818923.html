				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The defendant in this case was convicted of the crime of <em>bandolerismo.</em>  He was charged with having been the chief of a large band of outlaws and desperadoes which bore the name of "Santa Iglesia;" which for several years terrorized the Provinces of Bulacan, Nueva  Ecija, Tarlac, Bataan, and Pampanga.  He was duly convicted after a long trial and sentenced to death.  From that judgment of conviction no appeal has  been taken.  The case is before us <em>en consulta</em>.</p>
<p>On the 8th of August, 1900, the accused took the oath of allegiance to the  Government of the United  States before Lieut.  Col.  K. E. Wilier   of the  Forty-third  Infantry. Scarcely, however, had he taken  his oath than he began to violate it.  His acts of sedition, if not rebellion, became so open that he was  subsequently captured and convicted  of sedition. In 1902 or 1903 he broke jail and escaped.  Having obtained his freedom he entered upon a career which, from about the year 1902 until the 24th of July, 1910, when he was again captured, made his name a fear and  a dread among the  peaceful inhabitants  of an  extensive territory. The band, of which he was the head, wrought havoc among the peaceful pueblos of the provinces named for more than seven years.  In June, 1902, this band, composed of from two to three hundred people,  at least partly armed, attacked the barrio  of  Santa Rita, pueblo of  Cabiao, Province of Nueva Ecija, shouting as their battle cry "Viva Santa Iglesia."  In this  assault they  captured five residents of the pueblo and carried them  away as prisoners.  On the 19th of June, 1903, this same band attacked the pueblo  of San Juan de Guimba, Province of Nueva Ecija, taking from the local police their arms and ammunition.   In the same month and year the same band, composed of about fifty persons, most of them armed with guns or revolvers, having disguised themselves  as  Constabulary  and  announcing themselves as such,  raided the pueblo of Jaen, Nueva Ecija.  They attacked the principal municipal building, stole several guns and revolvers, with ammunition, and captured the municipal president, a person named Apolinario Gimenez, and  three municipal policemen.  On the 2d day of July, 1903, ten members of the Philippine  Constabulary located in the barrio of San Miguel, pueblo  of Concepcidn, Province of Tarlac, were poisoned by members of this band, by direct order of the accused, for the purpose of obtaining the arms and ammunition which  they  carried.  During the  same month the said band, composed of about one hundred persons, armed with revolvers and bolos,  entered the pueblo of Mabalacat, Province of Pampanga, and assaulted the Constabulary quarters  in said town, crying "Viva Santa Iglesia," capturing six Springfield rifles, three guns, six revolvers, with ammunition, and three pair of shoes belonging to the soldiers.  In this  attack they killed a Constabulary soldier called Anacleto Galang and captured another named Benito Galang.  On the 1st day of  February, 1903, this band, composed of about two hundred men, armed  with bolos, daggers, and clubs entered the pueblo of San  Jose, Nueva Ecija, and assaulted the quarters of the Constabulary, stealing nine guns, with cartridges and ammunition, and wounding two of the Constabulary.   On the 15th of September, 1908, the same band,  composed of about three hundred persons, armed  with thirty guns, a second time assaulted  the  pueblo of San Jose,  Nueva Ecija, with the battle-cry of "Viva Felipe Salvador," attacked the  Constabulary quarters, killed a Constabulary soldier, and  stole two guns and some accouterments.   This action  was directed by Felipe Salvador, who, not desiring to expose himself personally to the danger involved in the attack, remained at Malapad na Bato near by.   In September, 1903, the band, at that time containing about one hundred and fifty .men, armed with bolos and clubs, raided the barrio of San Vicente, Province of Nueva Ecija, and captured about one hundred persons, including women  and children.  In the month of January or February of the year 1906 the accused, Felipe  Salvador,  as chief of the  said band  of brigands known as "Santa Iglesia," issued a circular  letter calling on the people of Hagonoy and Calunapit in the Province of Bulacan to assemble at  Mount Arayat for the purpose of attacking the Constabulary quarters at Malolos, capital of the Province of  Bulacan.  Many  of the residents of these places complied  with the order  and made their  way to Mount Arayat, where they were met by the  accused.  As a result of this gathering a new band was formed  bearing the same name.  On the night of the 15th of April, 1906, armed with guns, revolvers, daggers, and bolos, they entered the pueblo of Malolos aforesaid, crying "Viva Felipe Salvador—Viva Santa Iglesia—Viva Apong Ipi," and assaulted the Constabulary quarters, killing three Constabulary privates  and wounding four others,  stealing  twenty  guns, seventeen belts, each one containing fifty cartridges.  They captured  Juan Palomo,  who  was  held  as  a prisoner on Mount Sinucuan  or  Mount Arayat nearly six weeks.  On the 9th day of July, 1906, this same band, composed of about fifty-three persons, armed with thirty-seven guns and other arms, and following the  orders of the accused in this case, fought a battle  with a company of Constabulary soldiers in  'the pueblo of Hagonoy,  Bulacan,  in  which one Constabulary soldier was killed and four members of the attacking band met their death.  In the month of March,  1910, this band of outlaws, led personally by the accused, Felipe Salvador, assembled to the number of about three hundred persons at Mount Arayat,  Province of Pampanga,  for the purpose of raiding the pueblo of Santa Ana and of assaulting and capturing the quarters of the Constabulary  at said place.  This  purpose was  not accomplished,  however,  by reason of the action of the authorities, which prevented its success.  Notwithstanding this fact, however, in the month of April, the band, armed, and directed personally  by the accused, entered the pueblo of Arayat, in the Province of Pampanga, and there on the following night fought a battle with the Constabulary in which one of the band was killed.</p>
<p>This is in synthesis the history of the operations  of this notorious band and its still more notorious leader.  During        the seven or eight years  to  which we have referred the Government was almost continually sending out expeditions for the destruction or capture of the band.   During this time the Government apprehended and punished more than a score of its' members.  The sums of money paid out by the Government in expeditions senj out against said  band, together with the  value of the property which said band captured and destroyed during its operations, amounted probably to nearly  one million pesos.</p>
<p>The  accused,  in  his  testimony  upon the trial, admitted having been the founder and the supreme chief of the band known  as  "Santa  Iglesia;"  that it  had been organized through his efforts  during the revolution against Spain and had continued until the time of his capture.  He asserted, however, that such  band was not a band of brigands or desperadoes but was  composed  of law-abiding  citizens, and that the sole end and purpose of the organization was to "pray to God for mercy."   In  the face of the overwhelming proofs in this case, such assertion does not even reach the dignity of an excuse.  The object and purpose of an organization  are best  demonstrated by its  acts or its results. It matters not what may be its constitution or  what may be the objects set down on paper.  If such organization dedicates itself to pillage and murder,  to nightly attacks on unoffending  citizens, to the destruction of homes and of property, to the capture of innocent men and women, it is a band of robbers and murderers, no matter what may be its objects as set down on paper or those proclaimed by its leader.  All these things this band did; and while it was doing them the  accused was  their chief, maintaining the organization by his  force of character,  using his genius for leadership to make  it effective, and sending it forth under the cover of night with instructions to attack and kill.</p>
<p>Counsel for the  accused  rests the argument which he presents upon two bases.  The first one is that the accused was not personally  present  at the time when  the raids of this band took place and, therefore, should not be held responsible for them  and the acts committed in the course           thereof.  The second is that, even if the accused were personally present, the penalty which he should suffer should be imposed under Act  No.  2036 of the Philippine Legislature, lately enacted, which deals with the crime of <em>bandolerismo</em>  and notably modifies the severity of the penalties prescribed  by the Act which was in force at the time of the commission of the  crimes alleged.</p>
<p>As to the first point little need be said.  It is of no consequence,  legally speaking, whether or not Felipe Salvador was  present  during  the raids of his band.   If they were under his  leadership,  if  they   did  the things  which  he commanded, if he planned  their campaigns of pillage and violence,  and gave the orders  which they executed it is immaterial  whether he  was personally  present or not.</p>
<p>That the defendant was at Mount Arayat while his band was  at Malolos is not  a controlling factor under  all  the circumstances of  this case.   Although  absent from many of the raids, including this one, nevertheless his genius had obtained  the men, had  organized them,  had laid the plans and directed the attacks.  Although miles away, his spirit and personality animated his men and were incarnated in the battle cry of "Viva Felipe Salvador, " "Viva Apong Ipi." Although absent,  their  faith in him filled them with an exultant courage; for was he not to them always, "Felipe, Salvador del Mundo?"</p>
<p>Moreover, should ignorance and superstition be punished when the intelligence and ability which  take advantage of them go free?  Is not the one whose ambition, intelligence, and genius  welds  into a weapon of offense the ignorance, prejudice; religious fervor and, mayhap, patriotic sentiment of others and hurls it into the midst of peaceful communities  with the  injunction to  destroy and  kill, fully as guilty as they whose   sentiments and  passions he  has aroused to attain his sinister purposes?   Is he whose ambitions, intelligence,  and  genius have worked upon the untrained faculties of others less responsible for the results than  the poor, deceived,  and  overwrought men upon whom liis genius  has  imposed?  But  for the baneful influence   of the accused at bar, but for his gift for organization, his genius for command, and an ambition which hesitated at no scruple, halted at no deed, and which drove everything before it, the members of his band, many of whom are now convicts  or outlaws,  would have followed the vocations of peace,  much valuable property would have been saved, and the years during which he operated would have  been, for many,  years of security and plenty instead of fear and want. We  do not believe  that the ignorant victims should be punished, while the one whose skill and cunning victimized them goes free.</p>
<p>As to  the second  point.   The  attorney for the accused asserts the proposition, under proper conditions well recognized in  Spanish law,  that a subsequent law punishing a crime less severely than a law previously enacted shall have retroactive effect and the penalty imposed for  crime, even though committed prior to the passage of the latter, shall be governed by the terms of the milder Act.  He, therefore, contends that Act No. 2036 of the Philippine Legislature, although a later Act,  should apply to this case.   In this contention counsel forgets that portion of the Act in question which  relates to the  condition which is  presented when, at the time  the crime of <i>bandolerismo </i>is committed,  there are committed other crimes of a graver and higher nature.   In other words, he failed to take into consideration that portion which provides that,  if during the commission of the crime of <em>bandolerismo </em> the band should also commit the crime of murder,  for example, the members of the band, although at the  time engaged in the crime of <em>bandolerismo</em>, might also be prosecuted for the  crime of murder.  In the case at bar several murders were committed by this band  and there were several  robberies with homicide.  We have already held in the case of U. S. <em>vs.</em> De Guzman  (19 Phil., Rep., 350)  that where the information contains facts sufficient to constitute the crime of murder or the crime of robbery with homicide, the accused may be convicted of such crime even though the caption  of the information charges <em>bandolerismo</em>.   In  that case we said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The facts alleged in the information fully, clearly and distinctly charge  the  crime of robbery with homicide,  as defined and penalized in article 502, paragraph 1,  of the Penal Code, as well as  the  crime  of <em>bandolerismo</em>.</p>
  <p align="center">*       *       *       * * * * </p>
  <p>"The crime of <em>bandolerismo</em>, as set out in the above information,  includes the crime of robbery with homicide. We have repeatedly held that  an accused may, the  proofs warranting it, be convicted of  any crime described  and charged by  the facts set out in  the information  irrespective of  the  characterization  of  the crime made by  the prosecuting officer.  The situation of the  accused  would not be  improved  by a conviction  of robbery with homicide rather than <em>bandolerismo</em>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is alleged in the information in this case  that  said band, under the immediate  orders  and directions of the accused in this case, "on the night of  the 15th of  April, 1906, entered the municipality of Malolos, Bulacan, attacked the quarters of the Constabulary at that place and killed three of its guards, wounded various soldiers,  captured a musician, Juan Palomo,  and stole twenty-three guns,  two revolvers, one thousand cartridges and a musical instrument, the property of said Constabulary and of the Insular Goverment."  The facts alleged in  this information  were fully supported by the evidence  in  the  case.  Together they demonstrate beyond question or doubt that the accused and his band  are  guilty of the murder of the three soldiers referred to.   This fact makes it  unnecessary to determine the question presented by counsel for the reason  that that Act provides for the very case  in hand.</p>
<p><em> </em>The judgment of the court below  is founded in the facts and  is supported by the law and must be and is hereby affirmed, without special  finding as to costs.</p>
