				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>These defendants  were charged with the crime  of  <em>robo en cuadrilla</em> in the Court of First Instance  of Ilocos Norte.</p>
<p>The evidence adduced during the trial shows that on the night of the 4th of May, 1904,  a band of persons, numbering about forty, more or less, armed with a gun, revolvers, bolos, and clubs, entered the convent in the pueblo of Piddig of the Province of Ilocos Norte, and took and carried away from said convent by force, money, clothing, and jewelry amounting to P3,000, more or less.  The said defendants were thereafter arrested and placed upon  trial  at Laoag, the capital  of the  said province, on the 11th of January, 1905.</p>
<p>After hearing the evidence adduced during the trial of said cause the court found that  the evidence  was insufficient to  support the charges against Nemesio Kabanglit, Valeriano Manuel, Candido Domingo,  and Nemesio  Domingo, and  therefore dismissed them from the custody of the law.</p>
<p>The court,  after considering the evidence, found  that Paulo  Cabamngan, Cecilio  Lazo, Valeriano  Baoit, and Quintin Quinduyos were guilty of the crime of <em>robo en cuadrilla</em>, in that they did, on the night of the 4th of May, 1904,. together with others unknown, armed with a gun, revolvers, bolos, and clubs, enter the convent, an inhabited house in the pueblo of Piddig, and by means of false keys did,  by force, take and carry away  certain money, clothing, and jewelry amounting in value to about P3,000, more or less. During the trial of the cause in the court below the prosevuting attorney presented one Severo Lagat as a witness, who testified that he was a member of the said band and entered the said convent on the night in question.  This witness identified Paulo Cabamngan,  Cecilio Lazo,  Valeriano Baoit,  and Quintin Quinduyos as persons who Avere also members of the said band who entered the said convent and assisted  in the said robbery.</p>
<p>Other witnesses were called during the said trial, among whom was Martin Nicolas, who was a <em>muchacho</em> in the said convent on the night of the robbery.   He Avas able to identify the accused Valeriano Baoit as one of the band avIio entered said  convent on the night in  question.  None  of the  other witnesses confirmed  the statement of Severo Lagat.</p>
<p>Other members of this alleged band were arrested and tried  in separate causes  (Nos. 2767,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 2768,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and 2769<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>). Tliis same Severo Lagat appeared as a Avitness in some of those other causes.  In cause No. 2769, United States  vs. Fabian Vallesteros,  in which the defendant  was charged with being a  member of this same band, this court held  in deciding that case that the unsupported testimony of Severo Lagat Avas insufficient upon Avhich to base a judgment of conviction.  In the present case his testimony is only supported by that of Martin Nicolas with reference to one of the accused, Valeriano Baoit; therefore the evidence  in this case is insufficient to support the charges against the other defendants, Paulo Cabamngan,  Cecilio  Lazo, and Quintin Quinduyos.  The cause is therefore dismissed as to them.</p>
<p>We further find that the testimony is sufficient to support the charges against Valeriano Baoit, and we therefore find him guilty.of the crime of <em>robo en cuadrilla.</em></p>
<p>The lower  court sentenced Valeriano Baoit  to be imprisoned for a period of fourteen years and eight months of catena  temporal.  This degree of punishment was imposed upon the theory  that the defendant  had committed the  crime  of robbery with intimidation to the persons in an inhabited house and by making use of false keys.  An examination of the evidence shows that  the defendant, together with an armed band composed of more than three persons, by force and intimidation,  committed robbery in an inhabited  house and  took  and  carried away money, clothing, and jewelry amounting to  P3,000, more or less. The evidence does not show, however, that the defendant and his companions used false keys in effecting the robbery; the keys that were used were obtained by force from persons in the house.  Therefore the penalty provided in paragraph 3 of article 508 of the Penal Code is  not applicable to this case.  (Decision of the supreme court of  Spain, 26th of December,  1807; decision of the supreme  court, of Spain 11th of June, 1872; Viada, vol. 2, p. 369.)</p>
<p>Under the evidence the defendant should  be punished in accordance with the provisions  of paragraph 5 of article 503  in relation with article 504 of the Penal  Code.  The penalty provided for in this paragraph is eight years eleven months and ten days to ten years of  prosidio mayor.  The crime was  committed in the nighttime.  The defendants evidently took advantage  of that time in oi'der that they might the more effectually carry ont their criminal purposes.  Nocturnity  should therefore be considered as an aggravating  circumstance.  There   were   no  mitigating circumstances.   The defendant must  therefore be punished in the maximum degree of <em>presidio mayor</em>, which is ten years.</p>
<p>It is the judgment of  this court that the sentence of the lower court be modified and that the defendant be sentenced to be imprisoned for a period of ten years of <em>presidio mayor</em> and to pay the costs.</p>
<p>After the expiration of ten days let judgment be entered in accordance  herewith  and ten days thereafter the cause be remanded to the lower court for proper procedure.  So ordered.</p>
