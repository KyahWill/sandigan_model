				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The defendants were convicted in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Oriental Negros of the crime of <i> allanamiento de morada</i> and&nbsp; condemned each&nbsp; one to two years four months and one day of <i>prision correccional,</i> to a fine of 325 pesetas, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay one-third of the costs of the trial. They appealed.&nbsp; During the pendency of the case on appeal the defendant Lucio Hermenegildo withdrew his appeal.<br><br>It appears that&nbsp; on the 3d day of May, 1908, Ling Aling, Awi&nbsp; Cuan, and Co-boy Cuan were conducting&nbsp; a store in Bais, Oriental Negros.&nbsp; The building used as a store was occupied by them&nbsp; also as living quarters. About 7 o'clock of the morning of that day the defendant Santiago Villanueva went to the store and sought to buy a pair of shoes on credit.&nbsp; He&nbsp; was refused.&nbsp; Nevertheless&nbsp; he wrote a promissory note and leaving it on a table in the store&nbsp; went out.&nbsp;&nbsp; At about 10&nbsp; of the same morning he returned to the store and asked credit for a shirt and a&nbsp; pair of pantaloons. On being&nbsp; again refused&nbsp; credit he asked for&nbsp; a piece of paper, saying that&nbsp; he would send to&nbsp; his house for the money.&nbsp; He then left.&nbsp; At about 1 of the same day he went again&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; store,&nbsp; this time, however,&nbsp; accompanied by the other two defendants.&nbsp; Having entered&nbsp; he paid the proprietors&nbsp; for the&nbsp; shirt&nbsp; and pantaloons, whereupon the defendant Gamilla&nbsp; seized Aling by the hand and struck at him with&nbsp; his fist, failing, however,&nbsp; to reach him.&nbsp; At this the defendant Hermenegildo struck Co-boy with a stick and the defendant Villanueva, seizing a piece of iron, struck Awi Cuan in the temple with such force that he fell to the floor.&nbsp; The defendants then went out, and after their departure, the Chinamen&nbsp; closed&nbsp; the&nbsp; store and locked the doors.&nbsp; Soon the defendants&nbsp; returned.&nbsp; They forced the door&nbsp; open, breaking&nbsp; the lock&nbsp; and fastenings, and again entered the store.&nbsp;&nbsp; The defendant Gamilla assaulted Aling with a stick, wounding him in the face, breaking his nose and causing injuries which required more than thirty days for their cure.<br><br>These facts are fully established and proved by the testimony&nbsp; of the Chinamen assaulted and by that of Vivencio Baldado,&nbsp; Eusebio&nbsp; Buso, Jose&nbsp; Maria&nbsp; Montenegro,&nbsp; Bais Emilio Tevez, and Eladio de Guia.<br><br>Testimony tending to&nbsp; contradict that of the prosecution as to the forcible entry was given by the defendants.&nbsp; The court below,&nbsp; however, found in favor of the&nbsp; Government. A careful examination of the evidence leads us to the conclusion&nbsp; that&nbsp; his finding was correct.&nbsp; Moreover,&nbsp; in&nbsp; any view that may be taken&nbsp; of it, we meet the decision of this court in the case of United States <i>vs</i>. Arceo (3 Phil. Rep., 381), in which the court, speaking by Mr. Justice Johnson, says, at page 383,&nbsp; interpreting&nbsp; article&nbsp; 491&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Penal Code:<br><blockquote>"We are not of the opinion that the statute relates simply to the method by which&nbsp; one may pass&nbsp; the threshold of the residence&nbsp; of&nbsp; another without&nbsp; his consent.&nbsp; We think&nbsp; it relates also to the conduct, immediately after entrance, of him&nbsp; who enters the house of another without his consent. He who being armed&nbsp; with deadly weapons enters the residence of another in&nbsp; the nighttime,&nbsp; without consent,&nbsp; and immediately commits acts of violence&nbsp; and intimidation,&nbsp; is guilty of entering the house of another with&nbsp; violence and intimidation and is&nbsp; punishable under subsection 2 of article 491 of the Penal Code.&nbsp;&nbsp; (See Viada, vol. 3, p.&nbsp; 303; Gazette of Spain of the 28th of March, 1883; Viada, vol. 6, p. 363; Gazette of Spain of the 19th of May, 1892, p. 165.)"</blockquote>The court, however, erred in the imposition of the penalty.&nbsp; The penalty&nbsp; provided for by law is that of <i>prision correccional </i>in its medium and maximum degree, from two years four months and one day to six years, with the accessories provided by law, and&nbsp; a fine of from 325 to 3,250 pesetas,&nbsp; with subsidiary imprisonment in&nbsp; case&nbsp; of insolvency.&nbsp; There being present in the commission of the crime neither aggravating&nbsp; nor&nbsp; extenuating circumstances,&nbsp; the penalty imposed should&nbsp; have been in the medium&nbsp; degree.<br><br>The judgment of the court&nbsp; below is hereby modified&nbsp; and the defendants&nbsp; are sentenced each one to three years six months and twenty-one days of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correctional</span>, to the accessories provided by&nbsp; law, to a fine of 1,000 pesetas, to subsidiary imprisonment as provided by&nbsp; law, and&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay one-third of the costs.&nbsp; Thus modified,&nbsp; the judgment of the court below is affirmed, with costs against the&nbsp; appellants, equally.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano,&nbsp; C. J., Torres, Mapa, Johnson, </i> and <i>Carson,&nbsp; JJ.</i>, concur.<br></div>
