				<BR><STRONG>WlLLARD,  J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>In  the  evening of November 28,  1901,  Don  Teodoro Suller gave a ball at his house in the pueblo of Cabuyau. The defendant went to the ball  without any invitation from the owner, danced with an American doctor, and then went away.  He returned  after a  short time.  What then occurred is thus described by Don Teodoro: "I met  him almost in  the door of the stairway, took him by the hand, and said to him, 'Friend, what do you wish; do you come to dance?'  Without making any answer he roughly withdrew his hand and struck me.  "Q.—Did you not ask  him to take a  seat?  A.—I did so, but he answered nothing and immediately  entered."   Don  Teodoro also  testifies that he had heard that the defendant had some design of attacking  Captain Davison, who was in the  sala, and that he stopped him because he was attempting to enter that apartment.  The testimony of Ramos is to the effect that the owner of the house attempted to  stop  the defendant as he was  entering the sala.</p>
<p>The  defendant  admits that he struck Don  Teodoro so that he fell,  and  that he had a  quarrel  with  Captain Davison, in which he, the defendant, drew his revolver.</p>
<p>It seems clear to us that the purpose of the owner of the house was to prohibit the defendant not from entering his house  but from entering the sala in order  to avoid a quarrel between the  two Americans.   His taking the defendant by the hand, asking him if he  came to dance,  and requesting him to be  seated, are inconsistent with  the idea that he was attempting to  keep the defendant from entering the house.  His  efforts to prevent this meeting were praiseworthy and the conduct of the defendant extremely reprehensible.   The  latter  can  not, however,  under  the evidence be convicted of the, offense of allanamiento de morada.</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to consider other questions argued by counsel for the defendant.</p>
<p>The judgment is reversed  and the defendant acquitted, with the costs of both instances de oficio.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Cooper, Ladd, Smith,</em> and <em>Mapa, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
