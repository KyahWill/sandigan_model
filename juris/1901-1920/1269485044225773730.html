				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. HILARION LAFUENTE, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">A combination of the facts of this case and the applicable provisions of the 
substantive law are these:
<p>The Municipal Law (now sees. 2319, 2321, 2322, and 2323 of the Administrative 
Code of 1917) authorizes a municipal council to grant the exclusive privilege of 
fishery or right to conduct a fish-breeding ground within any definite portion 
of the municipality. The same is to be let to the highest and best bidder. In 
conformity with this law, the municipal council of Loon, Bohol, enacted an 
ordinance providing that fishing privileges should be sold at public auction. 
Accordingly on April 26, 1916, a public auction for the sale of fishing 
privileges was conducted by the municipal president of Loon, with the assistance 
of the municipal treasurer, the municipal secretary, and a councilor. The 
municipal secretary, who is the accused herein, acted as secretary of this 
committee. A list of the successful bidders was made and now appears as Exhibit 
A. When the auction was concluded, the municipal treasurer being busy, the 
bidders were told to deposit the amount of their respective bids with the 
municipal secretary. Eighteen persons did so deposit various sums in payment of 
fishery privilege licenses and one person turned in a small sum for his land 
tax. The total was P53.22. The complainants did not receive the licenses for 
which the money was paid, nor was their money returned to them, nor was it 
placed in the municipal treasury.</p>
<p>The attorney <em>de officio</em> for appellant makes no assignments of error, 
but contents himself with what amounts to a motion for the withdrawal of the 
appeal. This attempt of counsel <em>de officio</em> to dismiss the appeal cannot 
be allowed without the consent of the client.</p>
<p>One question suggested by the brief of the Attorney-General is that the 
information may be defective for multiplicity. In reality the information 
charges nineteen distinct <em>estafas</em>. However, since no objection was made 
to the information in the court below on the ground that it charged more than 
one offense, such objection is not available in this court. (U. S. <em>vs</em>. 
Paraiso [1905], 5 Phil., 149, affirmed on appeal to the United States Supreme 
Court [1907], 207 U. S., 368.) Moreover, even if the question could be raised, 
the different sums should be considered as a part of the same transaction and 
accordingly may be treated as one offense and included in one information.</p>
<p>A second possible question is whether the defendant has committed the crime 
of <em>estafa</em> or the crime of misappropriation of public funds. Did the 
defendant have charge of the money "by reason of his office or employment" as 
these words are used in Act No. 1740 punishing misappropriation of public funds? 
Was he "accountable" for the funds, as the word is used in section 2672 of the 
Administrative Code of 1917, succeeding Act No. 1740? At the auction, the 
defendant was acting in his official capacity as municipal secretary and as a 
member of the auction committee. The money was deposited with him under 
authority of law. It was his duty under the ordinance and the direction of the 
municipal president to receive and turn over the money. The obligation of the 
defendant was not to return the money to the complainants, but to safeguard the 
same for the Government. The money became municipal funds the instant it came 
into the hands of the defendant. The bidders had done all that had been asked of 
them, and should have received their licenses on demand. Instead the defendant 
embezzled the money for his personal use. These salient facts make up the crime 
of misappropriation of public funds.</p>
<p>We can distinguish this case from others convicting of <em>estafa</em>. Thus, 
in The United States vs. Radaza ([1910], 17 PhiL, 286), where a municipal 
councilor received from another person the sum of P5 for a permit to slaughter 
animals under a promise to secure a receipt therefor and failed to secure the 
receipt or to account for the funds, it was held that he did not commit the 
crime of misappropriation but <em>estafa</em>. The reason assigned by the court 
was that he did not receive the money in his official capacity. In direct 
contrast, the money herein was taken charge of by reason of the defendant being 
the municipal secretary and secretary of the auction committee. He acted as 
secretary in receiving the money and not as a private individual. He had charge 
of the money by reason of his office. (<em>See</em> as corroborative of the 
view, which holds officials liable for <em>estafa</em> and not for 
misappropriation of public funds, U. S. <em>vs</em>. Torrida [1912], 23 Phil., 
189, and U. S. <em>vs</em>. Villarta [1915], 31 Phil., 335.) As a case of a 
different tenor in which the defendant was charged with <em>estafa</em> and 
convicted of misappropriation of public funds, there can be noticed The United 
States <em>vs</em>. Guzman ([1913], 25 Phil., 22).</p>
<p>One further question concerns the power of a court to order indemnification 
to the Government of the Philippine Islands or any branch thereof in judgments 
convicting of misappropriation of public funds. This court, in considering Act 
No. 1740 in its relation with the provisions of the Penal Code, expressly held 
in the affirmative in The United States <em>vs</em>. Velazquez ([1916], 33 Phil. 
368). While Act No. 1740 has since been repealed, the basic sections of said Act 
have been carried into the Administrative Code with a slight change in 
phraseology. The right to indemnification exists in misappropriation of public 
funds cases.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the judgment of the lower court is reversed and the 
defendant and appellant is sentenced to imprisonment for six months, to pay a 
fine of P53.22, to indemnify the municipality of Loon, Bohol, in the amount of 
P53.22, or to suffer subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay 
the costs of both instances, and is declared forever disqualified from holding 
any public office or employment of any nature whatever. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson, Carson, Araullo, Street</em>, and 
<em>Avance√±a, JJ.</em>, concur.</p></div>
