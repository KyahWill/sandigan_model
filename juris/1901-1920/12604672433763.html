				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>In the decision in this case it is found as a fact that the titles to the  steamer <em>Balayan</em> and  the  coasting vessel Ogoño<em> </em>are registered in the name of the defendant.  It must be assumed from this that the defendant has the legal title to the vessels, as without it they could not be so registered.<br>
  <br>
These facts standing alone show that the defendant is the owner of the property.</p>
<p> Two other facts, however, appear in the decision which the appellee claims warranted the court below in deciding that the defendant was not the owner.</p>
<ol>
  <li> That court found that the money with which the vessels were purchased was  furnished by the plaintiff, the father of the defendant.   Does this  fact make him the owner of them, the title having been taken and registered in the son's name?</li>
</ol>
<p> The various ways in which the title to property  may be acquired are stated in article 609 of the Civil Code.</p>
<p> The plaintiff never  acquired the title to these vessels in any  one of the ways therein described.   He did not acquire it by donation or  succession.  He  did not acquire it by means of any contract.</p>
<p> The court does not find that the father and son had between themselves any  contract of any kind  by  virtue of which the son agreed to transfer the title  to the father or to hold it for his benefit.</p>
<p> There is an  allegation in the complaint that the defendant acted as the agent of the plaintiff in the purchase. This is denied in the answer and there is no finding in the decision which supports this  allegation of the complaint.</p>
<p> There is  only  the  bare  fact that the price of property which was conveyed to the defendant by a third  person was paid by the plaintiff.  It can not be said that the law by reason of this fact transfers any title or interest in the thing itself to the plaintiff.</p>
<p> Article 1090 of  the  Civil Code provides that "obligations derived from the  law are not to be presumed.  Only those expressly provided for in this Code or in special laws are enforceable."</p>
<p> It  is provided in article 161 of the same Code, relating to minors, that "the ownership or enjoyment of property acquired  by a minor child with funds of his parents, pertain  to the latter."  This article does  not apply to the present case,  for the son was of age.</p>
<p> This is the only provision which we have found anywhere in the laws now in force that declares the property to belong  to the person who paid the money,</p>
<p> Nor can such general doctrine be found in the former law.  Law 49, title 5, <em>partida </em>5, the effect of which is incorrectly stated in the brief of the appellee, expressly provided that  property bought with  another's money should  not belong to the owner of  the money except in certain enumerated cases of which this is  not one.</p>
<p> Law 48, title 5, <em>partida </em>5, also expressly provided that where one bought with his own money property the title to which  he procured to be transferred to  a third" person, such  third person had the right to keep it  by reimbursing the other for his outlay.</p>
<p> It may be true that the laws in some of the United States would in  this case raise a resulting trust  in favor of the plaintiff.  But such laws are not in force here; and  whatever other right the plaintiff  may have against the defendant, either for  the  recovery of  the money paid or  for damages,  it is clear that such payment gave him no title either legal or equitable to these vessels.</p>
<p> If there were evidence in the case which would have justified  the  court below in finding that the defendant acted  as the agent of the plaintiff or that there was some other  contract between them, he should have incorporated such findings in his decision.</p>
<p> Article  133  of the Code of  Civil Procedure requires the court to file a written decision.  If the facts stated in that decision together with those admitted  in  the pleadings are not sufficient as a matter of law to support the judgment, it must be reversed, if excepted to.</p>
<p> The record, however, contains all  the evidence and an examination of it shows that no such findings would have been  warranted.  As to the Balayato, it appears that  the son had nothing whatever to do  with its purchase.  It was bought by the father with the money of the conjugal partnership,  and the title by his direction placed in the son's name.</p>
<p> As to the Ogoño, the father's intervention in the purchase nowhere appears.  He simply testified that it was bought with  his money.</p>
<p> It is said that the court below found as a  fact that  the father was the owner of the vessels and that we can not disturb this finding because there was no motion for a new trial.  This contention can not be sustained.   The ultimate question in the whole case was: Who owned this property? The resolution of that question  depended upon the application of legal principles to the facts connected with  its acquisition  and  subsequent  management.   Those  facts were  that the father bought and paid for it,  and that the titles to it were taken and registered in the son's name.  A statement that by reason  of  these facts  the father is the owner is a statement of law and not a finding of fact.</p>
<ol start="2">
  <li>  It was found as a  fact that the father had exercised acts of ownership over the vessel. That finding is entirely consistent  with the legal ownership  by the  son.  The exercise of such acts could not transfer such ownership from  the son.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> There is in the record a letter written by the defendant to the plaintiff in which the latter is asked if he desires to sell the <em>Balayan</em>.   This letter is  not incorporated into the findings and we have no right to consider it.   But, if we had,  it would not in  our opinion change the result. Such  a letter might well have been  written by a son to a father, both of them recognizing the fact that the son was the owner of the property as to which  the  inquiry made.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> In conclusion we may say that even on the supposition that a written and recorded title to vessels  may be overcome by parol evidence, that offered in this case was insufficient to accomplish such a result.  As to the <em>Balayan</em>, there is nothing whatever to show why the father placed the title in his son's name.  It may have been either as a gift or a loan. As to the Ogoño, there is the simple declaration of the father that he paid for it.  This may  have been either a gift or a loan.</li>
</ol>
<p> The judgment is reversed and a new trial is granted with costs against the  appellee.</p>

<em>DISSENTING</em></div>
<p><strong>COOPER, J.:</strong></p>
<p> This action was brought  by  Don  Francisco  Martinez against Don  Pedro Martinez, the appellant, for  the recovery as owner of two  certain vessels, the steamship <em>Balayan</em>, and the  schooner Ogoño.</p>
<p> The plaintiff brings the suit for himself and in representation of  his deceased wife,  alleging that the ships were bought with funds belonging to the community estate.</p>
<p> The defendant in his answer  claims that he  is  the exclusive owner of the ships,  basing his right to such ownership upon their registration in  his name in the office of the Captain of the Port, and further, that the ships were purchased with his individual money.</p>
<p> The first assignment of error is that "the court erred in adjudging the ownership of the property of the  ships <em>Balayan</em> and Ogoño to Don Francisco Martinez, the latter not having presented written documents of the acquisition of said ships nor certificates of inscription in the registry."</p>
<p> I. This assignment of error raises  the question of the sufficiency of the  proof to sustain the judgment of the court below and requires an examination of the evidence taken in the  court below and a trial of the questions of fact as to the ownership of the property.</p>
<p> Section 497 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that in the hearings upon bills of exceptions in civil actions and special  proceedings, the Supreme  Court shall not review the evidence taken in the court below nor retry the questions of fact except as in that section provided, which are in the following cases:</p>
<p> (1)  Where assessors  have sat with the judge and both assessors are of the opinion that the findings of,  fact and judgment are wrong and have certified their dissent.</p>
<p> (2)  Upon  the ground of the discovery  of new  and material evidence.</p>
<p> (3)  Where the excepting  party  files  a motion  in the Court of First Instance for a new trial upon the grounds that the findings of fact are plainly and manifestly against the weight of evidence  and  the judge overrules the motion and due exception was taken to his overruling the same.</p>
<p> There was no motion  for a new trial in the Court of First Instance,  nor is it contended  that  this case falls within either of  the other exceptions.</p>
<p> It is insisted  that while this  court will  not review or retry questions of fact, yet if it appears from the findings of fact as contained in the decision of the lower court that the facts do not justify the judgment or conclusions of law the case will  be  reversed for a new trial.</p>
<p> There was  no exception taken to the judgment, the exception being only such as is inferred from the presentation and allowance of the bill of exceptions.</p>
<p> This is not sufficient to justify this court in entertaining such objection; the rule is that where a judgment is entered not warranted by the  findings  the proper  remedy is by application to the court  in which it is entered to correct or vacate the judgment, and unless the action of the court has been thus invoked the petition will not be considered on appeal.  (Scott <em>vs</em>. Minneapolis  R. R.  Co., 42 Minn., 179.)</p>
<p> But had the exception been properly taken an examination of the findings clearly shows  that  the judgment is sustained  by  them.  The  following findings of fact were made by the  lower court and are contained in the judgment,  to wit: "I am of the opinion that Bon Francisco Martinez, for himself and in representation of his wife, is the actual and true owner of said steamship and schooner and has  exercised  over them acts of  ownership  and dominion,  and  that  these  ships were  bought  with the funds by him furnished.  With respect to the fact that the steamship and  schooner may have been registered in the name of the  defendant, Pedro Martinez, it is my opinion that this fact can not be considered as  prejudicial to the true right of the plaintiff."</p>
<p> An analysis of this finding will show  that it consists of the finding of,  first,  an ultimate fact,  that is, that the plaintiff D.  Francisco Martinez is  the actual  and true owner of the steamship and schooner, the property in controversy;  second, the probative fact that he  has  exercised over them  acts of ownership and dominion and that these ships were bought with funds furnished by him, and, third, the probative fact that the ships were registered in the name of the defendant, Pedro Martinez.</p>
<p> The majority of the court regard the first finding—that is, that the plaintiff is the actual and true owner of the property in controversy—as a statement of law and not a finding of fact, and have rejected it as a finding of fact. In reversing the case  for a new trial the decision is based upon the finding that the  vessels  are  registered  in the name of the defendant, and it is  said that it must be assumed that the defendant has a title to the vessels as without it they could not be so registered.</p>
<p> The conclusion I reach is the reverse of that reached by the court.  The finding of the plaintiff's ownership of the vessel and schooner is not a conclusion  of law, but is the finding of an  ultimate fact in the case, and was the proper and the only finding that could have been made.  As stated in the opinion, the ultimate question in the whole case was, Who owned this property?</p>
<p> The  supreme  court of Minnesota has passed upon the precise question in the  case of Common <em>vs</em>.  Grace  (36 Minn., 276).  The finding of the lower court in that case was that "John  Grace was, at the time of his death, the owner in fee simple of  the  real estate."  The appellant made a request in the court below for additional findings. Upon the refusal of the lower court to make such additional findings it was assigned .as error on appeal.  Mitchell, J., says: "The facts  required to be found are  the ultimate facts forming the issues presented by the pleadings and which constitute the foundation of a judgment and not those which are simply  evidentiary of them.  The  court is not required to find merely evidentiary facts or to set forth and explain the means  or processes  by which  it arrived at such findings.  Neither evidence, argument, nor comment has any  legitimate  place in the findings of fact The test of the sufficiency of the findings of fact by a court, we apprehend, is, Would they answer if presented by a jury in the form of a special verdict, which is required to present the conclusions of fact as established by the evidence, and not the evidence to prove them, and to present those conclusions  of fact so  that nothing remains to the court but to draw from them conclusions  of law?  In the case at bar the finding of fact that John Grace was, at the time of his death, the owner in fee simple of the real estate in question was the ultimate  fact upon which the decision of the case depended.  It covered the only issue in the case, and was a sufficient foundation for a  judgment in favor of defendants.  It  could only be arrived at upon the hypothesis that the deeds in dispute were duly executed, and the finding necessarily implied and included this,"</p>
<p> In the case of Daly <em>vs</em>.  Socorro  (80 Cal.,367) it is said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "The appellant further contends that the cause should be reversed because the court failed to find upon certain other issues presented.   His right  to maintain the action was based wholly upon his ownership and right of possession, and these being found against him it is immaterial to him whether  the court found as to other facts or not, as the judgment must have been against him whatever the other finding might have been."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> The finding of the court that the ships  were registered in the name of the defendant is the1 finding  only  of  a probative of evidentiary fact, that is, it is the finding ply of evidence tending to prove the ultimate fact, to wit, the fact of ownership. The various means of proving this ultimate fact is the evidence.  Thus, a bill of sale is evidence of ownership.  The possession of property is prima fade evidence of ownership, and so perhaps is the registry of ships evidence of the ownership of the  person in whose name it is made; but while it is evidence tending to prove ownership, there may be other evidence in the case totally  destroying its value, such as a sale and conveyance of the ship by the owner or person in whose name it is registered made subsequent to the date of the registration; title by prescription as against the party  in whose name the ship is  registered; by proof that the party in  whose name the ship is  registered held the title simply as agent of the  party claiming ownership.   For this reason the finding that the vessels are registered  in the name  of the defendant is inconclusive and is entirely insufficient as a finding of fact. The finding of  fact must be such as includes the entire issue or the ultimate fact to be proven, and in  this case, as is stated  in the opinion, the ultimate  question in the whole case was who owned this property. The lower court has responded to  this issue by saying that "while the ships are registered in  the name of the defendant that  this fact can not be considered as  prejudicial to the direct ownership of the plaintiff.  That D. Francisco  Martinez, the plaintiff, for himself and  in representation  of his wife, is the actual and true owner of said ships and has exercised over them acts of ownership and dominion."</p>
<p> There is no conflict in the findings, for, as stated by the lower court, the ship may be registered in the name of the defendant and still be owned by  the plaintiff.  But, if any such conflict exists, then the finding of the probative fact that the vessels are registered in the name of the defendant must give way to the .finding of the ultimate fact that the ownership is with the plaintiff.<br>
  <br>
When the ultimate fact is found no finding of probative facts  which may  tend  to establish that the ultimate fact was found against  the evidence  can overcome the finding of the ultimate fact.  (Smith <em>vs</em>. Acker, 52 Cal., 217; Perry <em>vs</em>. Quackenbush, 105 Cal., 299; Smith <em>vs</em>. Jones, 131 Ind.)</p>
<p> Not only is the  ultimate fact of ownership which is the paramount finding in the case allowed  to be overthrown by the less important and subsidiary finding of the evidentiary fact of registration of the ship, but the opinion wholly ignores the other finding of the  probative fact, that is, that  the  plaintiff  has exercised  acts of ownership  and dominion over the property  and that the ships were  purchased with funds furnished by him.</p>
<p> II. It is said in the opinion in  referring to a letter written by  the defendant to the plaintiff that this letter is not incorporated in the findings and  we have no right to  consider it, yet the court  in its decision has gone  into an examination of the evidence thus improperly brought here.</p>
<p> This ambiguity in the opinion makes it  necessary to refer briefly to the evidence.  Such  review will show that the evidence before the lower court was entirely sufficient to support the finding of ownership in the plaintiff.  It  consists  of  letters written to   the plaintiff by  his agents, Armstrong &amp; Sloan, who acted for him in the purchase of the ship <em>Balayan</em>; the testimony of the plaintiff as to his purchase and payment of  the price of the ship; proof of witnesses of the acts of ownership  on  the  part of the plaintiff after the purchase of  the ships  by him; that the defendant resided  with the plaintiff, who was his father, and that the defendant had no  means with which to make such purchase; various acts  of the defendant recognizing the plaintiff's ownership in the vessel; evidence introduced on the part of the plaintiff tending to show his ownership and tending to show that the defendant acted simply as plaintiff's agent in  the control which he  exercised over the ship.</p>
<p> In one of the  letters written by Armstrong &amp; Sloan to the plaintiff dated August 22, 1892, they say:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "We have credited to your  account #18,843.65 which you left  before your departure for  the  cost of the ship bought for you in Hongkong." Also the book entries in the mercantile office of Armstrong &amp; Sloan, in which appear the following:</p>

  </tbody></table></blockquote>
<p> Another letter is in evidence from the same parties to the plaintiff dated October 13, 1892, in which they say  that they had telegraphed the day  before to Hongkong for the ship to sail "and we have written that the name <em>Balayan</em> be given it."</p>
<p> Several  other  letters were  introduced  written  by  the same parties to the plaintiff concerning the ship <em>Balayan</em>, in wljich they say  the deal was closed and by which they make arrangements for incidental expenses in the equipment of ship, insurance upon it, and its sailing from Hongkong  to Manila,</p>
<p> A letter is also contained in the  record  written by  the defendant  to the plaintiff on  the 27th of  October, 1899, which is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "Manila,  October 27,  1899. —Esteemed  Father: With my kindest regards (beso a V. la mano).   With  respect to the steamship <em>Balayan</em>, Senor Sloan sends word to you that there  is an American who wishes to purchase it  for 24,000 pesos, and asks whether you  desire to sell it or not that you reply because he awaits your answer  *  *   *"</p>
</blockquote>
<p> It also appears in evidence  that  the ship <em>Balayan </em> had the initials of the plaintiff "F.  M." on the smokestack, and that at som« recent date the defendant had caused these initials to be erased and those of his own substituted.</p>
<p> The defendant for a number of years managed the plaintiff's business under a general power of attorney, and  was a member of his family, and such acts  of ownership as he exercised over these ships may be properly referred to this authority.</p>
<p> When the relationship of the parties—that is, that of son and father—is considered in connection  with other proof in the case, the conclusion is irresistible that the ships are owned  by the plaintiff and  that there has  been a most flagrant abuse on the part of the defendant of a father's confidence.</p>
<p> For the reason above stated I dissent from the  decision.</p>
