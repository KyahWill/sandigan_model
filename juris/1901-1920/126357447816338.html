				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On the 16th of .May, 1905, the defendant, Vicente Orosa, was charged h.y the provincial fiscal of Tayabas with the crime of illegal mnvriage (bigamy)  in that he, on or about the  1.8th  of April  of  the  same year,  being  previously canonieally married to one Laura  Tenorio, and  without such marriage having been  lawfully dissolved, contracted a civil marriage with Gregoria Zaballero  in the  town of Lucena of the same province.</p>
<p>Proceedings having been  instituted upon the said complaint, the  court, in view of the result of the evidence introduced at the trial, entered judgment  on  the 9th of August, 1905, sentencing the said Vicente Orosa  to eight years and one day's imprisonment  (prision mayor)  with the costs  of proceedings, from which said judgment the defendant appealed.</p>
<p>It was  fully  established  at the trial of this  case  by parol and documentary  proof that Vicente Orosa. had been lawfully married on the 1.9th of July, 1897, to one Laura Tenorio, in the  parish  church  of the town of Taal  by a priest  delegated by the regular parish priest of the said town in the presence of witnesses in accordance with the canonical  laws then in force in these Islands; that Laura Tenorio, tin1 lawful wife of the defendant was still  alive on the 31st of July, 1905, when the trial of this case was .commenced upon the aforesaid complaint; and that  Vicente Orosa contracted a civil marriage with Gregoria Zaballero on the  18th of April, 1905, before the justice of the peace of the town of Lucena, Tayabas.</p>
<p>Article1  471 of the Penal Code provides: "Any person who shall   contract  a  second  or  subsequent marriage without the prior marriage being lawfully dissolved shall be punished with the penalty of prision mayor."</p>
<p>For the purpose of showing defendant's guilt under the above  quoted  article,  the  prosecution  introduced  in evidence the certificate marked "Exhibit E,M appearing on ]5age 62, to the effect that on the 19th of July, 1897, before the  Rev.  Jos6 Villalobos, duly authorized by the parish priest of the town of Taal, in the presence  of the  witnesses Antonio  Panganiban  and Nieves Orosa,  the defendant, Vicente Orosa, and Xvaura 'Tenorio were  married in accordance with the rites of the Catholic Church  and with the formalities prescribed by the Council of Trent.</p>
<p>The aforesaid certificate, which contains a literal copy of the certificate of  marriage appearing on page 29, book 21 of  the register of marriages kept by the parish priest of the said  town,  is a public document and, as  such, lias the same value and the same  efficacy as though the original certificate had been presented.   It is stated in  the said certificate that it  is a literal copy of the original  which appears on the page  and in the book aforesaid of the register of  marriages of that parish.   The Rev. Cecilio Punsalan, who signed  the said certificate, states at the end thereof that the same is a true and correct copy of the original, and in a notarial act which appears on page 63 of the  record he stated  under  oath in the presence of the notary and  two witnesses on the 22d day of May, 1905, that the contents of the said  certificate of marriage, as set out  in his certificate, the same bearing the seal of the parish, is true. All of  these facts go  to show  that the certificate introduced in evidence for the purpose of establishing the  former marriage between the  defendant and Laura Tenorio was genuine and authentic.</p>
<p>On  the 19th of July,  1897,  the date of the certificate of marriage,  and prior to the 18th of December,  1899, the parochial registries  of marriages, baptisms, and  deaths were undoubtedly considered  as official books and  registers, and  the certificates  of marriages  and deaths taken from those books were considered as public documents,  provided such certificates were  duly entered upon  the said books, and the latter were kept by the parish priest in accordance with the  provisions  of the Council of  Trent, provisions which had the force of  law in  Spain as per the royal cedula of the 12th  of July, 1564, which was  later embodied in Law 13, Title I, Book I of the Noviftima  Rccopilacion.</p>
<p>Article 579 of the Code of Civil Procedure, in force at the time of the marriage in question, and up to the 30th of September,  1901, provides  in part as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The following are solemn public documents,  viz:</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
  <p>"6. Records or certified copies of records of births, marriages, and deaths, taken from the books thereof by parish priests or by persons in charge of the civil register."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Canonical certificates, or  certified copies thereof, duly authorized by  the respective  parish priests are still public documents, and may be used for the purpose of establishing the facts to which they relate, for there is no legal provision which has taken from  the parochial books and  the certificates therein recorded under the former legislation their nature as public documents.</p>
<p>The canonical certificates of marriage recorded in  the parochial books prior to the 18th of December, 1899, when General  Orders, No. 68, relating to marriage, was promulgated,  continue to be considered  as public, official documents; and  the parish priests still have the legal custody of such books, no law having been enacted prohibiting them, as such custodians of the said books, from issuing  certified. copies of the entries contained therein like any other custodians of archives.</p>
<p>In all  other respects the certificate, Exhibit E, has the same efficacy as  the original certificate  itself, according to section 299 of the Code of Civil  Procedure;  section 313 of which code, relating to proof of official  documents, provides:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Official documents may be proved,  as  follows:</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
  <p>"6. Official documents of  any other  class in  the Philippine Islands, by  the original, or by copy certified by the legal keeper thereof."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Section 314 of the same code provides:</p>
<p>"An authorized public record of a private writing may be proved by  the original record,  or  by a copy  thereof, certified  by the legal keeper of the record."</p>
<p>In the light of these legal  provisions,  and of the provisions of section 818  of the Code of Civil  Procedure above referred to, it is evident that the said  certificate of marriage, Exhibit E, was drawn up and issued by the priest charged with the legal custody of the registers of marriage from which it was copied literally.</p>
<p>Aside from the indisputable probatory force of the said certificate of marriage, the marriage itself, performed  in the parochial church of the town of Taal in the presence of a priest and witnesses in  accordance with the canonical laws, was  likewise  established by  the unanimous  testimony of eyewitnesses to the  said marriage.  These witnesses were Julian Gracia, Nieves Orosa, the aunt of the defendant, Martin Maranilla, Mariano Holgado, and Laura Tenorio, the latter having introduced in evidence  Exhibits A and B, two letters that her husband, the defendant, had written to  her, naming  her therein as his wife.  Consequently it can not be denied that the crime charged in the complaint has  been committed, and that the defendant, Vicente Orosa, has  been fully  proved  to be responsible therefor, counsel  for the defendant,  who waived his right to introduce evidence in his defense, having admitted that the accused had contracted the second marriage with Gregoria Zaballero on the 18th of April, 1905, before the justice of the peace of the town of Lucena, Tayabas, a fact further established  by a certificate of marriage marked "Exhibit D"  appearing on page 56 of the record.  Jose" Barcelona, the justice of the peace who issued the said certificate and before whom, and in the presence of two witnesses, the marriage between Gregoria Zaballero and the defendant, Orosa, was  performed, testified as to the authenticity  of the said certificate.</p>
<p>Even discarding the testimony of  the complaining witness, Laura Tenorio,  there is sufficient  evidence in the record as to the marriage of the defendant and herself, for in addition to the certificate of their marriage, we have the testimony of four witnesses who were present at  the tnne and who testified as to the priest who performed  the ceremony and  the witnesses of the  same,  and other details connected therewith.</p>
<p>Section 58 of General Orders, No,  58, provides that, except with the consent of both, or except in cases of crime committed by one against the other, neither husband nor wife shall be a competent witness for or against the other in a criminal action or proceeding to which  one or both shall be parties.   It can not be contended that the crime in question was not committed by the defendant, Vicente Orosa, against his lawful wife, Laura Tcnorio.   Therefore, under tin1 laws now in force, she was a competent witness in this case against her husband,  the contention of the defendant to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>
<p>No aggravating or  extenuating'  circumstances  having attended the commission of the crime, the penalty provided in article  471 of the Penal Code should be  imposed upon the  defendant in its medium degree,  as  was done by the court below.</p>
<p>For the  reasons hereinbefore stated, we are of the opinion that 'the judgment of the court below should be, and it  is hereby, affirmed, with the costs of this instance.  The defendant, Vicente Orosa,  is however  further sentenced to cutter the accessory penalties prescribed  in article 61 of the  Penal  Code.  After  the expiration  of ten days let judgment  be entered in accordance herewith and ten  days thereafter the case  be remanded  to the  court  below for execution.   So ordered.</p>
