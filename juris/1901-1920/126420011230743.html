				<H3>CHIENG AH SUI, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. THE INSULAR COLLECTOR OF CUSTOMS,  DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The present action was commenced in the Court of  First Instance of the city of Manila by filing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>
<p>After hearing the evidence, the Honorable A. S. Crossfield,  judge, granted the  writ as prayed  for,  from which order the Collector of Customs appealed  to this court.<br>
</p>
<p>It appears from the record that some time prior to the commencement  of the action in the lower court, a Chinaman by the name of Chieng Ah Soon,  who claimed to be a merchant doing  business' at Nos. 79 and  81 Calle  San Jacinto, in the city of Manila, returned from China bringing with him two  boys, named respectively  Chieng Ah Lui, 20 years of age, and Chieng Ah Sui, 16 years of age.   These boys, Chieng  Ah Lui and Chieng Ah  Sui,  were at first denied  admission into  the Philippine Islands.   An  investigation was held by the  board of special inquiry,  which board, after hearing all of the  witnesses which the father, Ah  Soon, desired to present, found that the said Ah  Lui was the son of Ah Soon and therefore admitted him.  The board, from the evidence,  found that Ah  Sui was not the son  of  Ah  Soon, and  refused him admission.  From that decision Ah Soon appealed to the Insular Collector of Customs, the Honorable H. B. McCoy, who,  upon due  investigation, found  that Ah Sui was  not the  person that he represented himself to be and was not the son of Ah Soon, and  therefore confirmed the decision of the board of special inquiry.</p>
<p>Upon petition a second hearing was accorded by the board of special inquiry, and again it was decided that Ah Sui was  not the son of  Ah Soon, and therefore not entitled to enter the Philippine Islands.  Again an appeal was made to the Insular Collector of Customs, who again confirmed the finding of the board of special inquiry.</p>
<p>A third hearing was  asked for and granted by the Collector of Customs.   Upon  the third hearing the board of special inquiry, after hearing all of the evidence which Ah Soon offered, again  found that Ah Sui was not entitled to enter the Philippine Islands.  A third appeal was taken to the Insular Collector of Customs, and again the finding of the board of special  inquiry was affirmed.</p>
<p>A  fourth hearing was asked for on the part of Ah  Soon, which was denied by the Insular Collector of Customs in the following language:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"In  reply to yours dated the 14th instant (September, 1910)  requesting a rehearing in the case of Chieng Ah Sui, I have to inform you that in this case the records show that three separate and distinct hearings have been given, at each of which testimony was introduced on behalf of the applicant, and the record of each of these hearings discloses the fact that all of the witnesses presented were heard.  It would  seem that this applicant has had  every reasonable and necessary opportunity to  present any testimony which tended to prove his right to enter the  Philippine Islands. These  hearings were  held on  July 19 and 23, and  August 10, while  the decision of the Insular Collector  of Customs upon the appeal therefrom was not rendered until September 3,  one and a half months after the first hearing.   It would  appear that even reasonable diligence would have secured the attendance of any necessary or competent witnesses  within the time stated  prior to the decision of this case on September 3.</p>
  <p>"For the foregoing reasons the application for rehearing is denied.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="right">(Signed)   "H. B,  MCCOY,<em><br></em></p><p align="right"><em>"Insular Collector of Customs"</em>
</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>From the third decision  of Colonel  McCoy,  as Insular Collector of Customs, an appeal was taken to the Court of First Instance, and there some proof was taken in  addition to that submitted before the board of special inquiry. Upon the record in the present case, the right of the Court of First Instance to take evidence in addition to that presented  to the board of special inquiry is very questionable indeed. In  the present case, however, the  judge of the Court  of First Instance declared that the testimony taken before  him in no way influenced his judgment in declaring that the applicant was entitled to the writ of habeas corpus.</p>
<p>Several  Chinese witnesses before the board of special inquiry claimed that they knew Ah Soon and  his family in China; that they lived in the same  town and  swore that he had several children, among whom was the boy Ah Sui. It appears also from the record that some months prior to the time when Ah Soon returned to the Philippine Islands with the two boys Chieng Ah Lui and Chieng Ah Sui, and upon leaving the  Philippine Islands for China,  he made a declaration which was placed on file  in the office of  the Insular Collector  of Customs, in which he gave the names of the members of his family.  The name  of Ah  Sui did not appear then as a  member of his family.  Ah Sui was sixteen years of age.   If he were a member  of  the family when Ah Soon returned to the Philippine Islands, he must have been a member of the  family a few months  theretofore.  Children do not reach the age  of sixteen  years in a few months.  Some objection was  made to the right of the board of, special inquiry  to take notice of said declaration presented by Ah Soon in relation to the members of his family.  The  declaration constituted a part  of the records of the office of the Insular Collector of Customs.  The board of special  inquiry is  a board  connected with that branch of the Government and it had a perfect right to take judicial notice of  relevant factg found  in their records.</p>
<p>We are of the opinion that the Insular Collector of Customs in no way abused the discretion conferred upon him in reaching the conclusion that Chieng  Ah Sui was not  the son of Ah  Soon and was, therefore,  not entitled  to enter the Philippine Islands.</p>
<p>Upon all of the facts contained in  the record, we are of the opinion that the order of the lower court admitting into the Philippine Islands the Chinese  boy, Chieng Ah  Sui, should be revoked, and that an order should issue that  the said Chieng Ah Sui  should be returned to  the  custody of the Insular Collector of Customs, in order that  he may be deported, in accordance with the law.  So  ordered.</p>
