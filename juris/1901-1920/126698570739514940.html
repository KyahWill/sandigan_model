				<h4>
				G.R. No. 9056, February 12, 1914</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. GUY ANGCO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>TRENT, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">An appeal by the defendant, Guy Angco, from a judgment of the Court of First 
Instance of the Province of Isabela, condemning him to be confined in Bilibid 
Prison for the period of one year and one day, to be deported from the 
Philippine Islands, and to pay the costs of the cause.
<p>The defendant pleaded not guilty to the charge of violating the Opium Law, 
and on March 7, 1913, two witnesses were examined on behalf of the prosecution, 
who testified to the facts as alleged in the information. A certified copy of a 
previous judgment of the same court convicting the defendant of a violation of 
the Opium Law was admitted in evidence. The case was then continued until the 
following morning, at which time the defendant asked to be permitted to change 
his plea of "not guilty" and to plead "guilty" and to be deported to China. He 
told the court that that was the third time he had been convicted of the same 
offense.</p>
<p>Appellant's counsel states: "The accused has been accorded a fair trial, but 
we believe that the court has erred in sentencing him to serve a term of 
imprisonment. Prisoners are an expense to the Government of the Philippine 
Islands and to imprison a man for a term and at the end thereof, to deport him, 
is a good deal like punishing the Government."</p>
<p>The Attorney-General says: "It appears that there is no good reason for 
putting this Government to the expense of maintaining and doctoring this 
Chinaman for an entire year before deporting him. It is, therefore, respectfully 
recommended that the sentence be modified, and that the defendant be ordered 
deported forthwith."</p>
<p>We concur with the Attorney-General and modify the judgment accordingly. A 
judgment directing the deportation of the appellant will be entered. Without 
costs in this instance.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J.,</em> and <em>Araullo, J.,</em> concur.</p>
