				<BR><STRONG>MORELAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of the Province of Cebu, Hon. Adolph Wislizenus presiding, convicting the accused&nbsp; of the crime of bribery and sentencing him to four months and twenty days of <i>arresto mayor</i>, to pay a fine of P65,&nbsp; with subsidiary imprisonment ib case of insolvency, and to pay the costs of the trial.<br><br>The appellant in this case was tried under the following information:<br><blockquote>"That on or about the 13th day of December, 1909, in the municipality of Cebu, in this province and judicial district, said Constancio Flores, being a member of the municipal police, detailed in the department of secret service, maliciously and criminally demanded&nbsp; and&nbsp; obtained from&nbsp; the Chinaman Chan Cam&nbsp; the&nbsp; sum of P25,&nbsp; as a consideration for the said Constancio Flores abstaining, as he did abstain, from complaining against and arresting the said Chan Cam for a violation of Act No. 1761;&nbsp; that the accused,&nbsp; in&nbsp; the performance of the duties of his&nbsp; office as such policeman, should have complained against and arrested the said Chan Cam."<br><br></blockquote>In the case of the United States <i>vs.</i> Buenaventura (6 Phil. Rep., 447), it appeared that one "Sergio&nbsp; was arrested without a warrant by the defendant, an officer of the Constabulary, for a supposed violation of the law against brigandage. After four days' detention&nbsp; the defendant released him upon his promise to pay the defendant P150, which he afterwards did.&nbsp; There was no evidence to show that&nbsp; the defendant arrested Sergio for the purpose of extorting this money from him."&nbsp; The court in that case held "that the crime committed was that of&nbsp; bribery, defined and punished in article 383 of the Penal Code,&nbsp; and not the offense defined in section 19 of Act No, 175."<br></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">The&nbsp; court said (p. 448):<br><blockquote>"It is suggested&nbsp; by the Solicitor-General&nbsp; that the case falls within section 19 of Act No.&nbsp; 175.&nbsp;&nbsp; We do not think, however,&nbsp; that that section is applicable, for there is no proof that the arrest was made for the purpose of extorting this money from the complaining witness."<br></blockquote>In the case at bar it clearly appears from the evidence that the Chinaman from&nbsp; whom&nbsp; the money was extorted had not committed the crime for the commission of&nbsp; which the appellant threatened to arrest him and that he had been guilty of no illegal act whatever.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is equally unquestioned that the accused knew that fact.&nbsp; This being so, it does not fall within the principle involved in the decision of the case above cited, as the particular reason in that case why the accused was held guilty of bribery was that it did not appear that the person from whom the money was obtained was not guilty of&nbsp; any crime, but, on the contrary, it&nbsp; appeared that it was very likely that the crime had been committed and that the accused&nbsp; had&nbsp; reasonable ground upon&nbsp; which to make the arrest.&nbsp; It is the necessary inference from that case that if it had appeared that, to the knowledge of the accused, no crime had been&nbsp; committed,&nbsp; and, therefore,&nbsp; he had no ground upon&nbsp; which to make&nbsp; the&nbsp; arrest,&nbsp; in other words, if he had arrested the accused knowing that&nbsp; he had no&nbsp; right to do so, he would have been guilty of the crime defined and penalized in section 19 of Act No.&nbsp; 175, instead of being guilty of bribery under article 383 of the Penal Code.&nbsp; This for the reason that he would have made&nbsp; the arrest for the purpose, necessarily, of extorting the&nbsp; money from&nbsp; the complainant.<br><br>It appearing in this&nbsp; case that the Chinaman Chan Cam was not guilty of any crime at the time of his arrest, and that the appellant in this case knew that fact, the necessary inference is "that the arrest was made for the purpose of extorting this money from the complaining witness."<br><br>In the case of the&nbsp; United States <i>vs.</i> Fulgencio&nbsp; (2 Phil. Rep.,&nbsp; 452), it&nbsp; appeared that one Eulogio, with certain companions, "had&nbsp; overturned a barrel from a<i> carreton</i> and scattered&nbsp; its contents in&nbsp; the&nbsp; streets. The defendant and&nbsp; his companions had, on this account, either arrested the witness or threatened to do so unless money was paid to them." After the arrest the&nbsp; accused, who was&nbsp; a&nbsp; policeman, told Eulogio that if he would give him P20 he would release him from arrest.&nbsp;&nbsp; Eulogio paid the money as requested and was released from restraint.<br><br>In that case the court&nbsp; held that the offense fell&nbsp; within the provisions of article 383 of the Penal Code,&nbsp; saying that "a police officer who receives money in consideration of&nbsp; his not&nbsp; arresting anyone guilty of a breach&nbsp; of a municipal ordinance is guilty of receiving a bribe under article 383 of the Penal&nbsp; Code."<br><br>It should be noted that there was present as one of the essential elements in the above case the fact that there had been&nbsp; a crime committed and that it&nbsp; was the duty of the accused to make the arrest and present the offender before the proper authorities for examination.&nbsp;&nbsp; (U. S. <i>vs.</i> Navarro, 3 Phil. Rep., 633; U. S. <i>vs.</i> Valdehueza, 4 Phil. Rep., 470; U. S. <i>vs</i>. Horca, 6 Phil. Rep., 52.)<br><br>The presence of this&nbsp; element clearly distinguishes that case from the case at bar.<br><br>It is more difficult to distinguish the following case:<br><br>In the case&nbsp; of the United States <i>vs</i>. Jader&nbsp; (1 Phil. Rep., 297),&nbsp; it appeared that&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant, Damaso Jader, as<i> cabeza de barangay</i> and <i>teniente</i> of the barrio of Candelaria demanded of certain of the inhabitants&nbsp; "cocks, hens, bamboo, and other articles under promise to relieve the persons from whom he had obtained them of the obligation to perform certain duties which they as citizens were required to perform."&nbsp;&nbsp; Under such demands said articles were delivered by certain of&nbsp; the citizens.&nbsp; Upon these facts&nbsp; an information was filed against the accused charging him with the crime of bribery.<br><br>The court in its decision said (p. 298):<br><blockquote>"The facts upon which the prosecutions&nbsp; are based&nbsp; constitute, in&nbsp; our opinion, five&nbsp; offenses of <i>estafa&nbsp; </i>and not of bribery.&nbsp; The articles received by the accused were&nbsp; not offered to him nor were they donated by the five taxpayers of his department for the purpose of corrupting&nbsp; him and in order to induce him to omit the performance of&nbsp; his duty, but were demanded by the defendant,&nbsp; who&nbsp; thereby abused his office as <i>cabeza de barangay </i>and <i>teniente</i> of the barrio. Therefore,&nbsp; instead of applying to these facts articles&nbsp; 383, 385, and 387&nbsp; of the Penal Code, section 1&nbsp; of article 534 should be applied,&nbsp; in connection with section 1 of article 535 and article 399 of the same code.&nbsp; These&nbsp; facts constitute exactions committed by a public functionary by an abuse of his official position, to the prejudice and&nbsp; in fraud of his fellow-citizens."<br></blockquote>The court in that case reversed the judgment of the court below convicting the accused of bribery, and in lieu thereof convicted him of <i>estafa </i>and sentenced him accordingly.<br><br>In&nbsp; this case&nbsp; the&nbsp; court expressly found that the&nbsp; property delivered to the accused was obtained by force and intimidation.&nbsp;&nbsp; He being&nbsp; a&nbsp; high official of the pueblo,&nbsp; and having considerable power, was able to&nbsp; coerce by a mere demand, particularly when&nbsp; cognizance is taken of the history&nbsp; of the office of&nbsp; <i>cabeza de barangay</i> and&nbsp; the&nbsp; tradition which in this country surrounded that&nbsp; office.&nbsp;&nbsp; While in that case the force and intimidation practiced are not so&nbsp; apparent as in the case at bar, still force and intimidation were present. They were the&nbsp; foundation of the decision.&nbsp; If they had not been&nbsp; present, the crime would hsive fallen under the provisions relating to bribery or kindred crime.<br><br>It&nbsp; is apparent, therefore,&nbsp; that&nbsp; under this decision,&nbsp; as well&nbsp; as&nbsp; under&nbsp; those&nbsp; above cited,&nbsp; the&nbsp; crime before us&nbsp; in the case at bar&nbsp; is not bribery.&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither do we believe that it is <i>estafa. </i> Article&nbsp; 399 of the Penal Code, referred&nbsp; to&nbsp; in the case last cited, provides&nbsp; that "the public official who, taking advantage of his office, shall commit any of the crimes specified in chapter&nbsp; 4,&nbsp; section&nbsp; 2,&nbsp; title 13 of this&nbsp; book (swindles and other false pretenses), shall incur in addition to the penalties prescribed herein that of temporary special disqualification&nbsp; in its&nbsp; maximum degree to perpetual special disqualification."&nbsp;&nbsp; As is readily&nbsp; seen, this article does no more than provide an additional&nbsp; punishment for the public officials who make their offices the means of committing <i>estafa.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; Before this article can be applied, the official must not only have taken&nbsp; advantage of his office&nbsp; but he must also have&nbsp; committed <i>estafa.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; The essential element of<i> estafa</i> as defined in article 535, paragraph 1, referred to in the decision above quoted,&nbsp; is&nbsp; deceit,&nbsp; artifice, machination, or cunning. (Groizard, vol.&nbsp; 5; Viada, vol. 3.)&nbsp;&nbsp; In that case the presence of deceit is expressly negatived by the finding of the court that the&nbsp; property was&nbsp; demanded,&nbsp; indicating clearly that there was on the part of the persons owning the property, no deceit and therefore no voluntary delivery thereof, the latter an&nbsp; element always essential to the crime of <i>estafa.</i> If property is obtained by deceit, cunning, fraud or misrepresentation, the delivery is always voluntary as contrasted with the delivery of property under force or intimidation. Obtaining property by&nbsp; fraud is, in a sense, obtaining&nbsp; it against the true will of&nbsp; the owner;&nbsp; but not in the sense of obtaining it by force or intimidation.<br><br>We do not believe, therefore, that&nbsp; this case should govern us in the decision of the case&nbsp; before us.&nbsp;&nbsp; Under&nbsp; the law in force here, we are of the opinion that the correct doctrine is laid down in the case of the United States <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Smith (3 Phil. Rep., 20).&nbsp; In this case the facts were that&nbsp; (p. 21):<br><blockquote>"On or about the 8th day of January, 1903, the defendant entered the house of one Esteban Delgado, acting justice of the peace,&nbsp; and then and there represented that he was a&nbsp; detective and that he was looking for certain persons called Josef a Garcia and Pedro Ralla.&nbsp; These said persons were called by the said defendant to the&nbsp; house of the said Delgado on the said day.&nbsp; When the&nbsp; said&nbsp; Josefa Garcia and Pedro Ralla&nbsp; arrived&nbsp; in&nbsp; the said&nbsp; house,&nbsp; the accused informed&nbsp; them that he had authority to&nbsp; arrest&nbsp; them, and that he had arrested one Isabelo Madera,&nbsp; and that he could release&nbsp; him.&nbsp; The defendant showed a letter&nbsp; to&nbsp; these persons, which he told&nbsp; them was his&nbsp; authority&nbsp; to arrest them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, on&nbsp; the&nbsp; same day, the accused ordered the said Josefa and Pedro to&nbsp; prepare their&nbsp; clothing in order to go to Manila,&nbsp; because&nbsp; he&nbsp; was going&nbsp; to take them&nbsp; as prisoners.&nbsp; He also ordered the said Delgado to prepare a vehicle to take&nbsp; the so-called prisoners&nbsp; to a&nbsp; point where he could secure transportation to Manila.&nbsp; A vehicle could not be found.&nbsp; The said Josefa and Pedro prepared their clothing for the trip to&nbsp; Manila.&nbsp; During the conversation between the accused&nbsp; and&nbsp; the said&nbsp; Josefa&nbsp; and Pedro the former&nbsp; continually threatened them with arrest and&nbsp; with personal harm.&nbsp; After the said persons were so arrested by the accused, he informed them that they had a remedy.&nbsp;&nbsp; He gave them to understand that if they would give him $1,000, Mexican, he would release them.&nbsp; Finally a compromise was made on the amount, and Josef a and Pedro paid to the said accused the sum of $700, Mexican."<br></blockquote>Upon these facts this court held the defendant guilty of the crime of&nbsp; robbery and not <i>estafa</i>.&nbsp; In its opinion&nbsp; the court cited a decision of the supreme court of Spain rendered on the 24th of June, 1875.&nbsp; In that case it appeared&nbsp; that the accused presented himself at the&nbsp; houses of various persons and demanded money on the pretext that it&nbsp; was for a band of malefactors who were in the mountains,&nbsp; and that he had been commissioned by such band to make such demands.&nbsp; He collected various sums&nbsp; from different&nbsp; individuals.&nbsp; The question before the court&nbsp; was whether&nbsp; the crime was robbery with intimidation or simply <i>estafa.</i>&nbsp; That court held that each demand constituted robbery with intimidation, saying:<br><blockquote>"Whereas, the essential&nbsp; element of the&nbsp; crime of<i> estafa</i> consists in the ingenuity or cunning employed by the agent for the purpose of deceiving the one whom it is intended to victimize, and&nbsp; such astuteness&nbsp; and&nbsp; cunning consequently exclude all idea of intimidation or the employment of other means of like nature tending to prevent or impede&nbsp; the exercise of the will, which remains&nbsp; free and independent although influenced by the statements made, circumstances which are also present in the perpetration of the deceit as mentioned in&nbsp; the Penal Code;&nbsp; and&nbsp; whereas whether&nbsp; the statement as to the band of malefactors was merely an invention for the purpose of obtaining the money, or whether the band&nbsp; actually existed, Pascual Mengaul y Domenech,&nbsp; on demanding the sums he&nbsp; appears to have received from different persons, attained his object by means of threats of injury which the&nbsp; robbers&nbsp; might inflict upon&nbsp; the persons upon whom the demands were made, if those persons did not comply therewith; and&nbsp; whereas this intimidation was&nbsp; actually present, the acts committed can not legally be considered to constitute <i>estafa </i>or deceit."<br></blockquote>The crime of robbery, in its&nbsp; various phases&nbsp; as defined by the Penal Code of these Islands, includes the common-law crimes of burglary, robbery, and some cases of extortion. It does not&nbsp; seem strange or&nbsp; illogical, therefore, to&nbsp; hold the crime proved in the case at bar to be robbery, although in Anglo-Saxon jurisdictions&nbsp; it&nbsp; would&nbsp; probably not&nbsp; be&nbsp; so denominated.<br><br>As we have seen, the&nbsp; information&nbsp; in this case charges bribery.&nbsp;&nbsp; It expressly negatives the essential elements of robbery, force or intimidation, or both, by asserting that it was the duty of the accused to make the arrest, indicating necessarily&nbsp; by&nbsp; such assertion that the Chinaman had committed a crime and that he ought to have been apprehended and presented.&nbsp;&nbsp; In such&nbsp; case the Chinaman parted&nbsp; with his money voluntarily in order to escape arrest, conviction and punishment.&nbsp; Bribery and robbery have little in&nbsp; common as regards&nbsp; their&nbsp; essential&nbsp; elements.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; the former the transaction&nbsp; is mutual and voluntary.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the latter&nbsp; case the transaction&nbsp; is&nbsp; neither mutual nor voluntary but is&nbsp; consummated by the&nbsp; use of force or&nbsp; intimidation.<br><br>The information in this case does not set forth facts constituting robbery, and the accused can not be here convicted of that crime.&nbsp;&nbsp; The facts proved showing robbery under the case of the United States&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.&nbsp; Smith, supra, and not&nbsp; bribery, as charged,&nbsp; the judgment below&nbsp; must be reversed&nbsp; and the information dismissed.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i> Arellano,&nbsp; C.
