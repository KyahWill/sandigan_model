				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On the 26th day of December, 1902, Francisco Martinez and the  defendant, Pedro Martinez, his  son, were the owners as tenants in common of two separate parcels of land in Calle Dulumbayan, in the city  of Manila,  each being the  owner of an undivided one-half of each  of said tracts of land.  On the 26th day of December, 1902, Francisco Martinez conveyed  to  the .plaintiff  his  undivided half interest in both said tracts of land.  This deed contained  a clause giving Martinez the right to repurchase the property within  one year  from  December 26,  1902. He did not repurchase it, and on the 28th of December, 1903, the plaintiff caused the proper marginal entry  to be made upon the books in the registry of property in which registry the conveyance had been recorded, and afterwards brought this action in March, 1904, asking for a partition of the two lots of land, between himself and the defendant, and that defendant account for and  pay to the plaintiff his part of the rents of the said properties from the 26th day of December,  1903.</p>
<p>It appeared that Francisco Martinez and the defendant, his son, were the owners as tenants in common of twenty-six other parcels of land; that in June, 1903, before the expiration of the  year in which Francisco Martinez had the right to repurchase  the property so conveyed to the plaintiff, he and the defendant, his son, made a voluntary partition of these twenty-eight  tracts of land, which partition  was  approved by the Court of  First  Instance of Manila on  the 15th day of June, 1903.  These twenty-eight tracts  of land had been acquired by Francisco Martinez during his marriage with his wife, Dona Germana Ilustre. The wife having died, her estate was in process of administration in  the Court of First Instance of Manila,  and the partition above  mentioned was made on the theory that these lands were the property of the conjugal partnership existing  between Francisco  Martinez and his  wife.   In this partition the  two parcels of land in question in this case fell to the defendant, and his claim  is that by this partition plaintiff  lost all  his  interest  in the property. Judgment  was entered in  the  court below in favor  of plaintiff as prayed for in his  complaint, and the defendant has brought the case here by bill of exceptions.</p>
<p>Article 399 of the Civil Code is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Every  coowner  shall have full  ownership of his part and in the fruits and benefits  derived therefrom, and  he therefore may alienate, assign,  or mortgage it, and even substitute another person in its enjoyment, unless personal rights are in question. But the effect of the alienation  or mortgage, with regard to the coowners, shall  be  limited to the  share which may  be awarded  him in the division on the dissolution of  the community."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This article gives the owner of an undivided interest  in the property the right to freely sell and dispose of it—that is, of  his undivided interest.  He has, no right to sell a divided part of the real estate.   If he is the owner of an undivided half of a tract of land,  he has  a right to sell and convey an undivided half, but he has no right to divide the lot into two parts, and convey the whole of one part by metes and bounds.  All that Francisco Martinez undertook to do in this case was to convey his undivided interest in these two properties.  This he had a perfect right to do, in accordance  with the terms of said article.   There  is nothing in the last clause of the article inconsistent with this position.  That declares simply that when the property is divided the purchaser gets an interest only in that part which may be assigned to him.  For the purposes of this case we see no difference between it and a case in which the tenant in common makes an absolute conveyance of his <em>undivided</em> interest in the property, without reserving the right to  repurchase.  In the case of an absolute conveyance of that character, the relation between the grantor in the deed and his cotenant is terminated.  They are no longer cotenants.  The grantee in the  deed  takes the place of the  grantor, and he and the other owner of the property become cotenants.  In such  a case the grantor loses all interest in the property,  and of course has no right to take any part in the partition of it.  It would be absurd to say that after such conveyance the grantor, who had lost all his interest in the property, could by agreement with the other owner make a partition of property in which he had no interest that would be binding upon his grantee.</p>
<p>We do not see how  the fact that Francisco Martinez and  his son were the owners of other pieces of  property as tenants in common  can  affect the question  presented in this case.   Each tract was separate and distinct from all the others.   The parties had a right to deal with one lot without any reference to the other twenty-seven.  The fact that the defendant acquired title  to all of  them by inheritance from his mother did not make them physically one tract of land, so that a conveyance by the son of his undivided half  interest  in one of these lots would amount to a conveyance of  a divided part of a  tract of land held by him in common  with his father.</p>
<p>The judgment of the court below is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant, and after the expiration  of twenty days  judgment should be entered in accordance herewith and the case remanded to the court below for execution.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Mapa, Johnson, </em>and <em>Carson, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
