				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The appellant, David, has been convicted of the crime of assassination&nbsp; and&nbsp; sentenced to&nbsp; life imprisonment.&nbsp; The court below held that he was not entitled to the benefits of the&nbsp; amnesty&nbsp; of July 4, 1902.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this we think&nbsp; that there was error.<p> The evidence&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; case as to the&nbsp; circumstances&nbsp; connected&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; commission of the offense is&nbsp; very conflicting.&nbsp; Mamerto Anteojo, a defendant who was acquitted in the&nbsp; court below,&nbsp; testified&nbsp; twice during the&nbsp; trial.&nbsp; His two statements were inconsistent with each&nbsp; other, but it is probable that his second one is more nearly the truth than&nbsp; the statement of any other of the persons who claim to have been eyewitnesses.&nbsp; He said that when he and one Cofu were returning from the&nbsp; forests they&nbsp; met French. He was looking for another&nbsp; American who&nbsp; had been arrested by the revolutionists&nbsp; and taken to the commander of those forces,&nbsp; Daniel T.&nbsp; Sisson.&nbsp; They immediately seized French and were taking him to the same chief,&nbsp; when, on passing by the house of Eusebio Cenarro, they saw there Francisco Villabrille and other revolutionists.&nbsp; Villabrille gave French something to eat and soon departed, leaving him in the charge of David and directing the latter to take the prisoner to Sisson.&nbsp; At nightfall they started, and on the&nbsp; way&nbsp; David killed French with a&nbsp; bolo.&nbsp; The offense was committed in Surigao some time&nbsp; in 1900.&nbsp; No&nbsp; complaint was presented until February, 1903.&nbsp; </p><ol><li>&nbsp; The&nbsp; appellant at the time in question was participating&nbsp; against the&nbsp; United&nbsp; States in&nbsp; the&nbsp; insurrection.&nbsp; The witnesses all agree that he and his companions were revolutionary soldiers.&nbsp; The appellant wore the uniform of a revolutionist.&nbsp; <br></li>&nbsp; <li> It sufficiently appears that the crime was political in its character.&nbsp;&nbsp; The only reason for seizing French was that he was an American belonging to the country against which they were then&nbsp; fighting. The fact that they were taking him to the leader of the revolutionary forces shows almost conclusively that the detention was for causes connected with the insurrection.&nbsp; While a political prisoner and on his way to headquarters he was killed.&nbsp; There can be no doubt that the killing was due to the same cause as the arrest, namely, that he was an American and an enemy.<br></li>&nbsp; <li> We think also that the evidence is sufficient to show that the appellant committed the act pursuant to orders of his superiors.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mamerto testified that David&nbsp; told him in the very act that he was ordered by Villabrille to kill the&nbsp; deceased.&nbsp; This testimony is&nbsp; something more than hearsay.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a declaration made in the act itself and is a part of it,&nbsp; Mamerto also testified that when Villabrille charged David with the custody of the prisoner he&nbsp; said something more to him&nbsp; which the witness could not hear. The&nbsp; fact that French was not killed by his captors when they first seized&nbsp; him but only after the conference with Villabrille is also entitled to weight.<br> </li></ol>&nbsp; The first declaration of the appellant appears in the record as&nbsp; follows:<br><blockquote><p> "The defendants having been examined in the&nbsp; presence of their defender, Don&nbsp; Daniel Toribio Sisson, Francisco David, 29 years of age, resident of Maynit, stated: 'That he knows nothing of the crime of which he is&nbsp; accused and of which he received notice when in Maynit; that he had orders from his superiors not to kill any Americans, but to seize them and take them to their presence.' " </p></blockquote><p> The statement as to the killing of prisoners&nbsp; was entirely irrelevant to the rest of the statement,&nbsp; and in view of the fact that it was given&nbsp; before his counsel, Avho was the superior officer mentioned in the testimony,&nbsp; we think&nbsp; it is not entitled to weight.</p><p> The rank which&nbsp; Villabrille had&nbsp; in&nbsp; the revolutionary army does not appear.&nbsp; But that it was superior&nbsp; to that of David is evident.&nbsp; They reported to him&nbsp; the capture. He assumed control of&nbsp; French while they were together and gave orders as to his disposition when he departed.</p><p> The appellant is entitled to the benefit of the amnesty above&nbsp; mentioned, and, on filing in this court&nbsp; the oath required by the proclamation, an order will be&nbsp; entered dismissing the case.</p><p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Cooper, Mapa,</em> and <em>McDonough, JJ</em>., concur.<br><br><br></p><p></p><hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><p></p><p align="center"><em><br>DISSENTING:</em><br>&nbsp; <br></p><p><strong> JOHNSON, J.,</strong></p><p> Amnesty should not be granted to the defendant in the above&nbsp; cause for&nbsp; the reason that the proof does not show that he is included among the class&nbsp; of&nbsp; persons named or mentioned in the proclamation of amnesty of July 4,1902, of the President of&nbsp; the&nbsp; United States.&nbsp; Neither does the proof&nbsp; show that the crime with which he is charged is included among those mentioned, in the same proclamation.</p></div>
