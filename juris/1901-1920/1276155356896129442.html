				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">HOMICIDE; CONTRADICTORY TESTIMONY.â€”From the Court of First Instance of Tarlac. The evidence of the witnesses for the prosecution being contradictory and not agreeing with the circumstances it was not considered sufficiently worthy of credit to identify the accused as members of the party that committed the homicide charged. Judgment reversed; first defendant acquitted; the second defendant having died while the ease was pending, the proceedings against him were dismissed.<br><br><i>Per Mapa, J.</i><br><br>For appellant: J.
