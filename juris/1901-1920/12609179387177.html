				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>By the final judgment of this court, entered on the 21st of May, 1903, in the case of La Junta Administradora de Obras Pias vs.  Regidor<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> (1  Off. Gaz.,  274),  the Obras Pias were  declared to  be  the  owners of certain houses in Calle Magallanes, in Manila, formerly owned and possessed by  the defendant in that suit,  Ricardo Regidor. On the day last mentioned that case was remanded to the court below, an order  for  the execution of the sentence was there made, a writ of execution was  issued, .placed in the hands  of the sheriff, and  on the same day  the Obras Pias were by him put in actual possession of the property.</p>
<p>For more than twenty years prior to this date Regidor had been in possession of this property,  and at  some date which does not appear he had  leased the same by a written contract to Williams,  Chandler  &amp; Co., the defendants, who were in possession thereof as such tenants on the 21st of May, 1903.  By the terms of this contract the rent was payable in  advance within the first five days of the  month, so that the rent for the month of May, 1903, was payable by the terms of the contract before the 5th  of  May.  On the 13th  of May Regidor assigned to the plaintiff the rent for the month of May,  amounting to $325, United States money, and on the 16th day of  May the  defendants were notified of this assignment,  and demand was made on them by the plaintiff for the payment to him of said amount of $325, which payment they refused to make.  On the 21st day  of May the  defendants were notified by the sheriff that the Obras Pias had been placed in possession of the property, and that the rent from that date should be paid to them.  The defendant paid the Obras Pias that part of the rent corresponding to the time from the 21st of May to the end of the month, and have in their hands the balance of the sum  of |325, to wit, the sum of $216.66, which they  have not paid to anyone.  Plaintiff brought this action against the defendants to recover the full sum of $325. He had judgment below, and the defendants moved for a new trial, which was denied, and they have brought the case here by bill of exceptions.</p>
<p>In their brief in this court they claim that the judgment should be reversed, because the Obras Pias was a necessary party in  the suit.  This objection was not made in the court below, either by demurrer or  answer,  and was accordingly waived.   (Sec. 93, Code Civ. Pro.; Tan Diangseng  Tan Siu  Pic  vs. Lucio Echauz,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> No. 1973, 4 Off. Gaz.,  143).</p>
<p>The rents in question  in this case were civil products according to the provisions of article 355 of the Civil Code, Part of article 451 of the Civil Code is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Civil fruits  are  considered as  daily proceeds, and belong to the possessor in good faith in this proportion."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same rule is announced in article 474 relating to usufruct.  For the  first twenty days of  the month of May Eegidor was the owner and  entitled to the possession of this property, and laying aside, for the present,  the question  of good or bad faith, he was  entitled  to  the rent produced  thereby for that time.  From the 20th of the month to  the end of the month the Obras Pias  were the owners of the property, and entitled to the rent produced by it during that time.  By the provisions of the articles of the Civil  Code above quoted this rent is considered as produced  day by day, and consequently the rent for the whole month of May must be divided in proportion to the time during which each one of said parties was the owner of the property.   The Obras Pias were, therefore, entitled to the rent for the last ten days, and Regidor to the rent for the first twenty days.  This right which Regidor had he assigned to the plaintiff, who became entitled to receive from the defendants the rent for that period.</p>
<p>The rent  was by  the  terms of the contract  between Regidor and the defendants payable in advance,  but this contract between these parties could not affect the rights of the  Obras Pias.  Regidor  had no right  to rent the property for any period after the 20th of May, and he could not deprive the Obras Pias of the rent of the property for the period from the 20th  of May to the end of the month by inserting in the contract with his tenants a provision that the rent should be payable in advance.</p>
<p>This court, in the decision above referred  to,  held, as a matter of fact and law, that Regidor was not a possessor in good faith, and was bound to account to the plaintiff in that case for all rents received by him for some years prior to the entry of judgment.  We do not see how this finding can affect the above declaration.  As to Williams, Chandler &amp; Co., the question of Regidor's good or bad faith is not important.</p>
<p>The plaintiff is entitled to the rent now in the hands of the defendants,  and the payment made by them to the Obras Pias of the balance of the rent for the month of May was properly made.</p>
<p>The judgment of the court below is modified so as to provide that the plaintiff recover of  the defendants the sum of $216.66, money of the United States, with  interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from the 16th day of May,  1903, and the costs of this action.   No costs  will be allowed in this  court.  After  the expiration  of  twenty days let judgment be entered in accordance herewith, and the case remanded to the court of its origin  for execution thereof.   So  ordered.</p>
