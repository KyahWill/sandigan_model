				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On the 13th of June, 1906, Abdon Rufin instituted a civil action in the court of the justice of the&nbsp; peace of Calivo, Province of Capiz, against Victor Rivicencio, for&nbsp; unlawful detention of a certain parcel of land, and during the trial, the appellant, Celestino Tolentino, who was employed&nbsp; by the plaintiff to represent him as his counsel, submitted to the court an i<span style="font-style: italic;">nformacion posesoria</span> (possessory&nbsp; title)&nbsp; in which the&nbsp; names of&nbsp; various&nbsp; persons are interlined&nbsp; so as to make it appear that they took part in the proceedings looking to&nbsp; the issuance of the said possessory title.&nbsp; The guilt of the accused of the crime of falsifying the document in question&nbsp; by interpolating the&nbsp; names of&nbsp; these persons, notwithstanding&nbsp; the&nbsp; fact that they took no&nbsp; part in&nbsp; the proceedings had pending&nbsp; the issuance of&nbsp; the same, is conclusively established by the evidence of record.<br><br>A mere inspection of the document itself clearly discloses that the names interlined therein are not written&nbsp; with the same&nbsp; ink as that with which the&nbsp; rest&nbsp; of the document was written, and the fresher appearance&nbsp; of&nbsp; these inter-lineations tends strongly to disclose that they were inserted recently and long after the original document was executed.<br><br>Catalino&nbsp; Macahilig, justice&nbsp; of&nbsp; the peace, who in&nbsp; the year 1895 executed the possessory title,&nbsp; swore that&nbsp; when executed it did-not contain the names which appear interlined&nbsp; upon&nbsp; its face,&nbsp; and that the names thus interlined are in the handwriting of the appellant Tolentino, with which&nbsp; the&nbsp; witness was thoroughly&nbsp; familiar, because&nbsp; the appellant had been employed by him for several years&nbsp; as <i>escribiente </i> (clerk).<br><br>Venancia&nbsp; Teodosio&nbsp; and Fermin Teodosio whose names appear interlined in the possessory title as present during the proceedings had prior to its&nbsp; issuance and as owners of property adjoining that described&nbsp; therein, testified that they took no part in the proceedings,&nbsp; and were not and are not as a matter of fact owners of any land adjoining that of Abdon Rufin.<br><br>And finally Rufin, who was a co-defendant of the appellant, positively&nbsp; denied&nbsp; that he himself&nbsp; had made the interlineations and&nbsp; swore that the document was in the possession and under&nbsp; the&nbsp; control&nbsp; of the&nbsp; appellant for several days before its&nbsp; submission as proof at the trial in the court of the justice of the peace of Calivo.<br><br>The defendant&nbsp; did not offer any testimony in his&nbsp; own behalf,&nbsp; and his counsel&nbsp; on&nbsp; appeal relies solely upon&nbsp; his contention that the evidence for the prosecution&nbsp; fails&nbsp; to establish&nbsp; beyond&nbsp; a reasonable&nbsp; doubt that&nbsp; the appellant actually inserted the interlineations in question.<br><br>We think the testimony above set out leaves no room for reasonable doubt upon this point, and that the finding by the trial court&nbsp; of&nbsp; the guilt&nbsp; of&nbsp; the accused of&nbsp; the crime&nbsp; of falsification of a public document, defined and penalized in section 6 of article 300, taken together with article 301,&nbsp; of the Penal Code, must be sustained.<br><br>The judgment of conviction and the sentence imposed by the trial court&nbsp; should be&nbsp; affirmed, with the costs&nbsp; of&nbsp; this instance against the appellant.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano, C.&nbsp; J., Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Moreland, </i> and&nbsp; <i>Elliott, JJ,,</i>&nbsp; concur.<br></div>
