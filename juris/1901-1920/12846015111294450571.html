				<h4>
				G.R. No. 12697, September 10, 1917</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. BENITO BARNEDO ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.
<br><br>D E C I S IO N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The defendants and appellants desired to have carnal relation with a mother 
and her two daughters. With this purpose in view, about midnight of the 2d of 
June, 1916, they broke into the house in which the women lived and maltreated 
them. The accused, however, soon desisted from their original intention and left 
the house. These facts are clearly proved.
<p>Appellants claim that the facts constitute, if anything, a crime distinct 
from that charged. In a way this contention is sound, and if the information was 
so worded, it might be possible to convict the accused of some other crime such 
as attempted rape. But while this may be true, it does not impeach in the 
slightest the basic point that with the object of violating these women, the 
accused committed a trespass to their dwelling with violence. All trespasses 
ordinarily have some motive, and although the motive herein was in itself 
criminal, it does not become so expanded as to override the offense which was 
charged and which without any doubt was perpetrated. Having in view the leading 
case of U. S. <em>vs</em>. Arceo ([1904], 3 Phil. Rep., 381), in which the 
offense of forcible entry is clearly analyzed by Justice Johnson, and the later 
case of U. S. <em>vs</em>. Ticson ([1913], 25 Phil. Rep., 67), in which Justice 
Torres on somewhat similar facts held the accused guilty of a violation of 
paragraph 2 of article 491 of the Penal Code (trespass to the dwelling), it 
results herein that the defendants and appellants are guilty of a violation of 
the same provision of the law.</p>
<p>There existing the aggravating circumstance of nocturnity, but there being no 
sufficient proof to show that the accused took advantage of superior strength, 
and there being no extenuating circumstances, the penalty to be imposed should 
be the minimum of the maximum of <em>prision correccional</em>. The judgment of 
the lower court is accordingly modified by sentencing each of the accused to 
four years nine months and eleven days of <em>prision correccional</em>, to pay 
a fine of two hundred pesos, or to suffer subsidiary imprisonment in case of 
insolvency, and to pay one-fourth of the costs of both instances. So 
ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Johnson, Carson, Araullo</em>, and <em>Street, JJ</em>., 
concur.</p></div>
