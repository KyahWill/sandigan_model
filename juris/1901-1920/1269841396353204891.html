				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The hearing on&nbsp; the appeal raised in this&nbsp; case has disclosed the following facts:&nbsp; <ol><li>The crime under prosecution consists of the making of a false entry in&nbsp; a&nbsp; registry book of births of the municipality of Libacaq, Province of Capiz, by recording therein that the girl Maxima, the daughter of Caridad Zausa, was the&nbsp; latter's legitimate daughter&nbsp; and that her father was Pedro Zausa, when in fact&nbsp; he was not her father and she was not the legitimate, but the&nbsp; natural&nbsp; daughter of Caridad Zausa.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></li>&nbsp; <li>Antero Inosanto was charged with having committed this falsification in&nbsp; an official register, as&nbsp; he&nbsp; was the municipal secretary whose duty it was to keep the same, and because,&nbsp; according to the&nbsp; complaint, he wrote&nbsp; and recorded in the said register the following words:&nbsp; "Maxima Zausa, legitimate daughter of Pedro Zausa and Caridad Zausa," which words are contrary to and different from those uttered by Pedro Zausa;&nbsp; the&nbsp; said Inosanto thus&nbsp; perverting the truth in the narration of the facts.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></li>&nbsp; <li>Martin O. Ruiz,&nbsp; the successor of Antero Inosanto to the office of municipal secretary, a witness&nbsp; for the&nbsp; prosecution,&nbsp; testified that he could not positively identify the writing&nbsp; of&nbsp; the entry&nbsp; in&nbsp; the register of births,&nbsp; aforementioned,&nbsp; as being that of Antero Inosanto, and, on cross- examination by the defense, stated that&nbsp; he knew the writing of the accused and did not believe that the entry in&nbsp; question was made&nbsp; by Inosanto, while he did&nbsp; identify&nbsp; the handwriting of other entries in that register as&nbsp; being that of the latter.<br></li>&nbsp; <li>According to this same witness, there is furthermore a&nbsp; certificate of birth, and there was issued a corresponding birth certificate for Maxima Zausa, which&nbsp; was presented as evidence in this case.&nbsp; This birth certificate is a copy of the entry, and the witness positively asserts that&nbsp; the handwriting is that&nbsp; of Vicente Coronel, an assistant to the former municipal secretary, Antero Inosanto.<br>&nbsp; </li><li>Antero Inosanto also&nbsp; issued a certificate&nbsp; which, according to the same witness, is made out and delivered&nbsp; when requested, and was presented in evidence&nbsp; as Exhibit C. There is no doubt that this certificate was issued by Antero Inosanto.&nbsp; It, also, is an exact reproduction of the falsified entry found in the register of births.<br></li>&nbsp; <li>The Court of First Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Capiz, which&nbsp; tried the case, found from the evidence that it was not Inosanto, but his&nbsp; clerk,&nbsp; Vicente Coronel,&nbsp; who&nbsp; recorded&nbsp; the&nbsp; birth, and that, at the time Pedro Zausa presented himself, Inosanto was in the council chamber, where the council was holding a session.<br></li>&nbsp; <li>Although the trial court did not consider the defendant guilty of the falsification committed in tfre register itself, it&nbsp; held him liable for the falsity contained in&nbsp; the certificate, Exhibit C,&nbsp; issued in accordance with that entry,&nbsp; for the reason that he&nbsp; knowingly&nbsp; recorded&nbsp; a falsehood,&nbsp; for he knew that the child Maxima Zausa could not be&nbsp; the legitimate daughter&nbsp; of&nbsp; Pedro and&nbsp; Caridad, knowing that Caridad was Pedro's daughter,&nbsp; and, instead of correcting and rectifying the entry in the&nbsp; register book, ratified and sanctioned the falsification&nbsp; therein committed, by his issuance of this certificate.</li></ol><p>By&nbsp; virtue of these findings the court held&nbsp; that the&nbsp; defendant was&nbsp; guilty of the crime penalized by article 310 of the Penal&nbsp; Code and&nbsp; accordingly sentenced him to suspension from public office for a period of three years, four months and one&nbsp; day, to pay a fine of 325 pesetas and, in case of insolvency, to the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment, and to the payment of the costs. <br></p><p>The Attorney-General, in this&nbsp; instance, is of the opinion that, leaving aside the question&nbsp; as to whether the defendant could issue the certificate Exhibit C and record therein facts contrary to or&nbsp; different from those contained in the register book without incurring the crime of falsification with&nbsp; which he is charged, Antero&nbsp; Inosanto certainly can not be sentenced under the said article 310 of the Penal Code, inasmuch as the Exhibit C is not a&nbsp; certificate of&nbsp; merit or service, of good conduct, of poverty or of other similar circumstances, that is to say, of purely personal things or accidentals, according to&nbsp; the&nbsp; interpretation given&nbsp; to the words of&nbsp; this last&nbsp; phrase by the supreme court of Spain in its decision of February 17, 1877;&nbsp; but&nbsp; that it is a certificate of an inscription in a register under his charge, with the data of&nbsp; which it&nbsp; substantially agrees.&nbsp; Therefore he concluded&nbsp; that, with a reversal of the judgment appealed from, the defendant should&nbsp; be acquitted, and the costs assessed <em>de&nbsp; oficio.</em></p><p>In&nbsp; entire agreement&nbsp; with the preceding opinion, the judgment appealed from&nbsp; is reversed&nbsp; and the defendant acquitted, with the costs&nbsp; <em>de oficio.</em></p><p><em> Torres,&nbsp; Mapa,&nbsp; Johnson, Carson,&nbsp; Moreland,</em>&nbsp; and <em>Trent, JJ</em>., concur.</p></div>
