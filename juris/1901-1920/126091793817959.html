				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This defendant was charged  with the crime of robbery committed in the pueblo of Binangonan, in the Province of Rizal, was arrested and tried in  the Court of First Instance of said province, found guilty of the crime of <em>4 en cuadrilla</em>, and sentenced to be imprisoned for a period of  six years and one day of <em>presidio mayor</em>, with the accessories of the law, to return the effects stolen or to indemnify the person robbed in the sum of 20 pesos, and to pay the costs.</p>
<p>The complaint charged the crime of robbery simply, and it was error for the court to convict him of  the crime of <em>robo  en cuadrilla</em>.  A defendant can not be convicted, under a complaint, for a higher offense than that charged in said complaint.  <em>Cuadrilla</em>, if the evidence justifies it, may be considered as an aggravating circumstance under a complaint for robbery, but if the complaint charges robbery simply, cuadrilla can not be used for the purpose of qualifying the crime as <em>robo en cuadrilla</em>.</p>
<p>An examination of the evidence adduced during the trial shows beyond peradventure of doubt that the defendant, together with thirteen or more persons, did, on  the night of the 23d of November, 1904, armed with guns and  revolvers, enter the house of one Pablo Sifiedo and by' force and violence take and carry away shoes, hats, clothing, and other things, having a total value of 20  pesos.   The defendant was the only one of the said malefactors who was identified by the persons who were in the house at the time of the robbery.   The evidence shows that the crime was committed in the nighttime, in the house  of another, and by a gang composed of more than three persons.   These facts  constitute aggravating circumstances.   The defendant, therefore, must be punished  in  the maximum degree of <em>presidio correccional</em> to <em>presidio mayor</em> in  its medium degree, which is imprisonment from  six years ten months and one day to ten years.  The sentence of  the inferior court is  therefore modified, and the defendant is hereby sentenced to be imprisoned for a period of ten years  of <em>presidio  mayor</em>, with the accessories of the law, and  to return the property stolen or to indemnify the person robbed in the sum  of twenty pesos, and to pay the costs.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Mapa, Carson,</em> and <em>Willard, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
