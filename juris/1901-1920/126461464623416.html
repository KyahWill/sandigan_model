				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>One morning in March, 1898, the four accused, provided with bolos and firearms, went  to  a granary belonging to Ponciano Alba, situated at the place called Tansa Norte, within the limits of  the town of Capiz, Panay, and, under threats of death, compelled Basilio Difon, the person left in charge by the owner, to leave the house and to deliver the <em>palay</em> which was  stored there under lock and key.  This Difon did and made  delivery of the <em>palay</em> by measure, this operation lasting two days.  It appeared that there were 447  <em>cavanes</em> of <em>palay</em>, which were taken out and carried away on sleds, in the presence of  witnesses, to the house of Fernando.   They also  carried  away agricultural instruments, a caldron, 2 <em>barotos</em>, 43 boards, 5 beams, a milk cow, and 10 carabaos which were in the field.  Difon was compelled to accompany the accused to help catch these animals.  Three full days were occupied in the transportation of these goods, which the accused claimed belonged to them, and which were taken by them to their houses.   Two of the carabaos were  recovered by the complaining witness, having been found in the possession of Fernando Vega, who objected to returning them, claiming that they were his,  and therefore a policeman named Barcenas,  who accompanied Alba, was obliged to issue a receipt for the carabaos taken by him, and which  were turned over to the authorities.  The animals  and the other property  taken are worth $1,384.85.  Some  days  afterwards, as  appears in the cause, the accused also took possession of certain parcels of land belonging to the complaining witness Alba.</p>
<p>The witnesses, Gualberto de la Cruz, Dionisio Bueno, Valentin Duro, Pablo Arroyo, Inocente Andrada, Toribio Lopez, and Tomas Aquijano, by their testimony corroborated the allegations of fact contained in the information, and those stated in detail by the complainant Alba  and his agent, Basilio Difon.</p>
<p>The accused, Fernando  Vega, his son Benito Vega,  and the brothers Gregorio Lara and Eduardo Lara, relatives, who were working for the Vega's, pleaded not guilty.  Fernando testified that he lived  in  the  barrio of Tansa, in which the  complaining witness,  Ponciano Alba, had no property whatever; that the two carabaos taken from  him were his property, and that on this account the police agent who took them  from him  by  order of the justice of the peace, gave him a receipt; but  that they were not the same carabaos which were subsequently shown him, as the latter were  old, unbranded animals, whereas his animals were young; that he so stated to the justice of the peace, but the latter paid no  attention to him, the witness adding that he had been on  bad terms with  Ponciano Alba  since 1891. Benito Vega testified that he lived with his father, and the brothers  Gregorio  and Eduardo  Lara testified  that in March, 1898-99,  Ponciano Alba  had no granary or  any other property in the barrio of Tansa Norte, and that at that time nothing of particular note had occurred at that place.  This was corroborated by  the testimony of  the witnesses Juan  Balasa, Hilario Bigares, Valerio Anerismatmat,  Vito  Lara, Estanislao Sello, Victorio Ballena, Filomena Asulpado, and Ruperto Acejo.</p>
<p>According to documents in the record introduced by the provincial fiscal, Dona Lucinda Barrios, widow of the  late Don Bernabe Lara, appeared before the clerk of the court and testified that her deceased brother-in-law, Ramon Lara, charged her, before his death, that the three pieces of land situated in Tansa, shown in the plat on pages 168 and 169, and which he had  inherited  from  his  deceased  father, Don Francisco Lazaro,  were to be delivered to Ramon's daughter, Dona Flora  Lara, and that therefore, in compliance with this verbal charge, she delivered the said lands to the said Flora Lara and to her husband, Don Ponciano Alba, who received them with gratitude.  The record also discloses a copy of the  inscription of certain lands in the registry of property.  (Folio 171.)</p>
<p>The defense of the accused also exhibited the will of Don Francisco Lazaro, from the  contents of which it appears that the said Bernabe, Ramon, and Flora Lara were his children,  and that Scverina Lara, the wife of Fernando Vega,  was a daughter of the testator by a second marriage, as stated  by  counsel for the  defense, who also exhibited a document  in which  Ramon  Lara appears to have stated that ho had pledged to his sister, for 50 pesos, a piece of land, planted in nipa palms, situated in the barrio of Tansa.</p>
<p>The facts stated, and which appear to be proven in this case, and  which are classified  in  the  complaint as constituting  the crime of  robbery  in  a gang, constitute  the crime  of coercion, denned and punished by article 497 of the Penal Code, inasmuch as Fernando  Vega, with his  son Benito and two employees of theirs, exercised violence or force and  intimidation on the person  of Difon, obliging him to open the rice deposit belonging  to Ponciano  Alba, absent from the place, and which was under lock and key, and compelling  him to deliver to them the rice and then to go away and leave the granary, of which he had been placed in  charge by the complaining witness; and also to accompany them to get in from the pasture the cow and carabaos mentioned, exercising such coercion that he dared make no opposition whatever to the acts of spoliation of the said property committed by the four accused,  or to their transportation, during a period of three  days, to  the house of Fernando Vega, by whom these acts, constituting the offense of coercion, were committed, without any  right to do so.   Notwithstanding the  fact that Fernando Vega, who was the principal offender in this case, alleges that he was the owner of the property of which  he took possession by means of this coercion of the person left in charge of it, it is not permissible to take the law into one's own hands, and to seize the property of a third person without being authorized to do so, and entirely disregarding the authorities whose duty it is  to settle disagreements between private individuals and to give each one that which is his due, in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>Fernando Vega, believing  that he was entitled to the property of which Ponciano Alba, by means of his agent, was in possession, in the barrio of Tansa Norte of the town of Panay, seized it with the assistance of one of his sons and two employees,  with  intent to take the law into his own hands, but without <em>animus furandi</em>.   Though  in effecting this seizure he availed himself of the intimidation  of the person so left in charge, the record does not disclose the existence of that specific wrongful intent which characterizes robbery.</p>
<p>It must  be understood, however, that this decision  is without prejudice to the rights of the complaining witness, Ponciano  Alba, the presumptive owner of the property taken, to recover the same by the proper civil action.</p>
<p>In view,  then, of the  fact that in the  complaint the offense charged  is that of robbery in a gang, and that the facts proven do  not constitute this offense, but constitute the offense pf coercion, it follows that, as the latter offense has not been prosecuted, no conviction of the accused can he had, and therefore the judgment below must be reversed and set aside, and,  should a new information be filed on the charge of  coercion, a new trial  should be had,  in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>The judgment, therefore, is set aside, and the judge, upon filing a new complaint, charging the said offense of coercion, will proceed to hold a new trial, in accordance with the law, without prejudice to the right of Ponciano Alba to bring the corresponding civil action to which he may be entitled.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano,  C. J., Cooper, Willard, Mapa,</em> and  <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em>McDonough, J.,</em> did not sit in this case.<br>
