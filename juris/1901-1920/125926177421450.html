				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> This prosecution is based upon a charge of the theft of a gold chain of the value of  70 pesos.   The information alleges  that this theft was committed upon an  occasion on which the  defendant had  gone to the house  of Dona Cayetana Veloso with the pretext of seeing and selecting a chain for the  purpose of buying it.   It is supposed that this  chain was lost—that is,  taken—on one day  in June, 19U0.  A year  afterwards, in June, 1901, Florentina Remoquillo stated to Dona,  Cayetana Veloso  that she had seen in  the possession of the accused the chain  which had been missed a year ago.</p>
<p>A  prosecution  was  commenced,  and of the  three witnesses called on behalf of the Government—one of them the woman Remoquillo—none were able to testify as to the actual theft nor to the fact that the  accused  was  in the house of the complaining witness  to  see  about buying a chain.   At the trial all three, as well as the complaining witness, made  self-contradictory  statements,  their  testimony being different from that given at the preliminary investigation.   It  was found impossible to prove anything when the case  was called  for trial.  The complainant offered to produce other witnesses, and the oase was set for a later  day.  On  this occasion five more witnesses were presented.  By the testimony of three of them an attempt was made to show that the accused had tried to give an account  of her acquisition  of  the jewelry in question. Two of them directly testified to the theft of which  the accused  is  charged.  These  two witnesses testified that they had been present a year before and that they had seen the accused commit the theft.  Nevertheless, they said nothing about it to the complaining witness until the day before they were put on the stand.   The 29th of July, 1901, having been fixed as the day for the continuance of the trial, one witness, Mateo Ufana, stated that on the 28th he had gone to the house of the complaining witness for the purpose of telling her what he knew about the matter, and that on this account she had called him as a witness, together with Melchor del  Mar, his companion on that occasion, whom Ufana reminded of what had taken place a year before in order that he might be called as a witness.</p>
<p> The court can not consider that the theft has been proven by the testimony of these two witnesses: it is sufficient to read their testimony and compare it with that of the complainant in order  to  observe its  self-contradictory and partial character.   The fact  of the theft of which the accused is  charged not having been proven, it follows that she was the lawful possessor of the chain in question.   The latter was  spontaneously  exhibited  by counsel for  the defense to the court in order that it might be shown to  the witness.</p>
<p> In accordance with articles 620, 844,  and 635 of  the Law of Criminal Procedure of Spain promulgated on  the 14tb of September, 1882, made supplementary law in these Islands  by virtue of article 95 of the provisional regulations for the application of  the  Penal Code  and still in force by virtue of the provisions of section 1 of General Orders, No. 58, series of 1900, on the subject of criminal procedure, the person in possession of a thing at the time it is seized by order of the trial  court is presumed to be the owner of it.  The possession  of personal property acquired in good faith is  equivalent to title thereto, in accordance with article 464 of the Civil Code now in force, and by the provisions of article 434 good faith is always to be presumed, the burden of proof being upon him Vho asserts that the  possessor holds in bad faith.</p>
<p> What appears to be really questionable is whether the accused is the owner of the chain, in view of the assertions of the complaining witness.   "Who is the owner? Who is the possessor?  This  it is  impossible  to determine a priori.  The relation of the person to the thing or the right is apparently the same with respect to ownership as with respect to possession.   From an exterior point of view he who exercises acts of ownership must  be  regarded  as the owner.  Hence  it is that owing to the impossibility of determining the question from appearances and in view of the impossibility of looking into the conscience  of the possessor—a matter entirely beyond the scope of judicial investigation—article 434 establishes the  presumption of good faith; it does not say that good faith exists, but that it is presumed.   This presumption is just, because possession is the outward  sign of ownership.   It is to be presumed that the right  of the  possessor is well  founded. This appearance of lawful possession must be accepted even though it  be in  reality nothing more than a disguise for bad faith, because this can not be known with  certainty until  proved, and because every person is presumed to be honest until the contrary is shown.  Hence, protection is given to the possessor against all other persons, whoever they may  be, and hence,  the precept of article 434  which demands proof of bad faith."  (Manresa, Commentary on the Spanish Civil Code, Vol. IV, p. 96.)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "He who may have lost a chattel  or has been illegally deprived of it may recover it from  the person in  whose possession it may be."   (Art. 464, Civil  Code.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p> These were the questions in issue.</p>
<p> Therefore the judgment below by  which the defendant is convicted of theft and condemned to two months and one day of <em>arresto mayor </em>and to the restoration  of the chain in question, which  is now in the  hands of the clerk, and to the payment of costs,  is hereby reversed and set aside, with the costs of both instances <em>de oficio</em>.  The chain in question will be returned to the accused, in whose possession it formerly was.  So ordered.</p>
<p> <em> Cooper, Mapa, Willard,</em> and <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
