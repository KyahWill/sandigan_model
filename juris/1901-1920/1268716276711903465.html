				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE, VS. PABLO CORPUS, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The accused in this case was convicted in the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan of the crime of <em>lesiones graves</em> as defined and penalized in No. 3 of article 416 of the Penal Code.<p></p>
<p>We are of opinion that the evidence adduced at the trial fully
established the guilt of the accused, and that the sentence imposed by
the trial court should be affirmed, except in so far as it fixes the
term of imprisonment of two years and four months <em>presidio correccional</em> instead of <em>prision correccional</em>, as prescribed by the article of the Penal Code under which he was convicted.</p>
<p>With this modification, therefore, the sentence appealed from is confirmed and the costs imposed upon appellant. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa,</em> and <em>Johnson, JJ., </em>concur.</p></div>
