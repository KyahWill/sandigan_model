				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The principal question presented by this appeal is whether or not the 
mortgagor of a chattel mortgage is relieved from liability by paying the 
mortgagee after the mortgage has been assigned to a third person, when he has no 
<em>actual notice</em> of said transfer.
<p>The pertinent facts as they appear in the record are: That on the 11th day of 
April, 1912, the plaintiffs borrowed of Eugenio Kilayko the sum of P2,000; that 
to guarantee the payment of said sum they executed and delivered to the said 
Kilayko a chattel mortgage covering machinery, crops and a number of carabaos; 
that said debt was due and payable on or before the 30th day of May, 1913; that 
the mortgagors had to deliver to the mortgagee (Kilayko) in the city of Iloilo 
their entire crop of sugar for the years 1912-13; that in compliance with the 
mortgage the plaintiffs herein did deliver sugar for said years from time to 
time in the city of Iloilo at the <em>bodega</em> (warehouse) of the defendant 
Yap Tico at the request of the said Kilayko; that finally a liquidation was made 
and there was found to be still due the mortgagee (Kilayko) the sum of P650; 
that that sum was sent to the mortgagee by a representative of the mortgagors 
(Antonio Horrilleno) and was by him delivered to Kilayko; that upon the delivery 
of said sum (P650) the mortgagee (Kilayko) on the 14th day of May, 1914, 
executed and delivered a cancellation of said mortgage; that in the month of 
May, 1912, the mortgagee (Kilayko) assigned and transferred said mortgage to the 
defendant herein, F. M. Yap Tico; that said assignment and transfer were duly 
registered upon the 14th day of April, 1913, nearly one year after the transfer 
had been made; that the cancellation of said mortgage as above indicated was 
duly registered on the 19th day of December, 1914; that neither Kilayko nor Yap 
Tico gave any notice whatever to the plaintiffs herein that said mortgage had 
been transferred; that the plaintiffs had <em>no notice</em> that the mortgage 
had been transferred nor that said transfer had been registered; that at the 
time the last payment was made on said mortgage (14th day of May, 1914) the 
mortgagee (Kilayko) gave no notice to the mortgagors, or to their 
representative, that the mortgage had been transferred, but upon the contrary 
made a search among the papers of his office attempting to find it, and not 
being able to find it at that time, promised to return the same to the 
mortgagors as soon as he could find it; that later the assignee of said 
mortgagee (Yap Tico), in accordance with the provisions of the Chattel Mortgage 
Law (Act No. 1508), proceeded to foreclose said mortgage, and the sheriff 
attached and took possession of all the property which said mortgage covered. It 
is admitted that the sheriff, as well as Yap Tico, were notified by the 
plaintiffs, at the time of said attachment, that the mortgage had been paid and 
cancelled. Notwithstanding that notice the sheriff insisted upon enforcing the 
attachment, and the plaintiffs, after some delay, obtained the release of the 
property so attached by the execution and delivery of a bond. This action was 
brought for the purpose of recovering the property, together with damages caused 
by said alleged illegal attachment.</p>
<p>The defendants answered by a general denial. Upon the issue presented by the 
petition and answer, the cause was brought on for trial, and after hearing the 
respective parties, the Honorable J. S. Powell, judge, rendered a judgment 
relieving the defendants from all liability under the complaint and ordered that 
the defendants recover of the plaintiffs the sum of P2.000, with interest at 12 
per cent from the 28th day of May, 1912, and the costs of the suit. From that 
judgment the plaintiffs appealed to this court.</p>
<p>The fact is not denied that while the mortgage in question was transferred by 
the mortgagee, Kilayko, to the defendant, Yap Tico, within less than two months 
after its execution and delivery, and that the plaintiffs had delivered sugar at 
the <em>bodega</em> of Yap Tico from time to time covering a period of nearly 
two years in partial payment of said mortgage, Yap Tico never gave notice or 
intimated to the plaintiffs that he was the owner of said mortgage. It is 
further established beyond question that the plaintiffs had no notice whatever 
of said transfer, unless the registration of said assignment had the effect of 
giving them notice, until long after the full amount of said mortgage had been 
paid to the original mortgagee, Kilayko, and said mortgage had been 
cancelled.</p>
<p>Unless the recording of the assignment operated as notice to the mortgagors 
their payment of the same, without actual notice of said transfer, relieved them 
from all liability under said mortgage. Article 1527 of the Civil Code provides 
that a debtor who, before having been informed of the assignment, pays the 
creditor, shall be free from the obligation. (<em>See also</em>, to the same 
effect, arts. 152 and 154 of the Mortgage Law.)</p>
<p>Manresa, in commenting upon the provisions of article 1527 of the Civil Qode, 
after discussing the articles of the Mortgage Law, says:</p>
<p>"We have said that article 1527 deals with the individual phase or aspect 
which presupposes the existence of a relationship with third parties, that is, 
with the person of the debtor. Let us see in what way.</p>
<p>"The above-mentioned article states that a debtor who, before having 
knowledge of the assignment, should pay the creditor shall be released from the 
obligation.</p>
<p>"In the first place, the necessity for the notice to the debtor in order that 
the assignment may fully produce its legal effects may be inferred from the 
above. It refers to a notice and not to a petition for the consent which is not 
necessary. We say that the notice is not necessary in order that the legal 
effects may be fully produced, because if it should be omitted, such omission 
will not imply that the assignment will not exist legally, but that its effects 
will be limited to the parties thereto; at least, they will not reach the 
debtor.</p>
<p align="center">"* * * * * * *</p>
<p>"Let us go to the legal effects produced by the failure to give the notice. 
In the beginning, we have said that the contract does not lose its efficacy with 
respect to the parties who made it; but article 1527 determines specifically one 
of the consequences arising from the failure to give the notice, for it 
evidently takes for granted that the debtor who, before having knowledge of the 
assignment, should pay the creditor shall be released from the obligation. So 
that if the creditor assigned his credit, acting in bad faith and taking 
advantage of the fact that the debtor does not know anything about the 
assignment because the latter has not been notified, and collects its amount, 
the debtor shall be free from the obligation, inasmuch as it has been legally 
extinguished by a payment which fully redounds to his benefit. The assignee can 
take advantage of all civil and criminal actions against the assignor, but he 
can ask nothing from the debtor, because the latter did not know of the 
assignment, nor was he bound to know it; the assignor should blame himself for 
his failure to have the notice made.</p>
<p align="center">"* * * * * * *</p>
<p>"Hence, there not having been any notice to the debtor, the existence of his 
knowledge of the assignment should be proved by him who is interested therein; 
and the debtor is not bound to prove his ignorance." (10 Manresa, 384, 385, 
387.)</p>
<p>The question, whether or not the registration of the assignment operated as 
notice, <em>ipso facto</em>, to the mortgagors, we are inclined to answer in the 
negative, for the reason that the law does not require such assignments to be 
recorded. While such assignments may be recorded,x the law is permissible and 
not mandatory. The filing and recording of an instrument in the office of the 
registrar, when the law does not require such filing and recording, does not 
constitute notice to the parties. (Burck <em>vs</em>. Taylor, 152 U. S., 634; 5 
Corpus Juris, 934.)</p>
<p>The debtor or party liable on contracts like the one in question is not 
affected by the assignment, until he has notice thereof, and consequently he may 
set up against the claim of the assignee any defense acquired before notice that 
would avail him against the assignor had there been no assignment, and payment 
by the debtor to the assignor, or any compromise or release of the assigned 
claim by the latter before notice will be valid against the assignee and 
discharge the debtor. (Vanbuskirk <em>vs</em>. Hartford Fire Insurance Co., 14 
Conn., 141; Clodfelter <em>vs</em>. Cox, 1 Sneed [Tenn.], 330; 60 Am. Dec., 157; 
Johnston <em>vs</em>. Allen, 22 Fla., 224; Shields <em>vs</em>. Taylor &amp; 
Tarpley, 25 Miss., 13.)</p>
<p>In the case of Shields <em>vs</em>. Taylor &amp; Tarpley, <em>supra</em>, the 
court said:</p>
<p>"No man is bound to remain a debtor; he may pay to him with whom he 
contracted to pay; and if he pay before notice that his debt has been assigned, 
the law holds him exonerated, for the reason that it is the duty of the person 
who has acquired a title by transfer to demand payment of the debt to give his 
debtor notice.</p>
<p>"Any act which a person may be compelled to perform by a proceeding at law 
may be done voluntarily, and he will be protected by the law."</p>
<p>It is generally held that if the law does not require a particular instrument 
to be recorded or registered, the recording of that instrument will not be 
<em>constructive</em> notice of its existence to anyone. (Burck <em>vs</em>. 
Taylor, 152 U. S., 634; Stewart <em>vs</em>. Kirkland, 19 Ala., 162; Lambert 
<em>vs</em>. Morgan, 110 Md., 1; Dial <em>vs</em>. Inland Logging Co., 52 Wash., 
81.)</p>
<p>The rule is very well stated in 4 Cyc. (pp. 33, 34) :</p>
<p>"Until notice of the assignment is given to the debtor, it will not bind him 
so as to deprive him of equities arising between the date of the assignment and 
the date when he received notice thereof. As to such equities, the assignment 
takes effect from the time the debtor receives notice and not from the time of 
the assignment."</p>
<p>In the case of Dial <em>vs</em>. Inland Logging Co., <em>supra</em>, the 
court said:</p>
<p>"We are not aware of any statute,, and none has been called to our attention, 
requiring or authorizing the recording of an assignment of a lien of the 
character of the one in this case. In the absence of such a statute, the 
recording of the assignment to the respondent before the assignment to the 
appellant did not operate as constructive notice."</p>
<p>It seems to be clear, then, that a debtor is protected if he pays his 
creditor without actual notice that the debt has been assigned. Such notice must 
be actual, and the recording of the assignment, there being no law requiring the 
same, will not operate as constructive notice to the debtor.</p>
<p>With reference to the question of damages, the proof shows that, by reason of 
the said attachment of the property included within the mortgage and the 
deprivation of the plaintiffs of the possession thereof, they were unable to 
grind certain sugar cane then already harvested and to reduce to sugar some 
juice already prepared, amounting to, as the record shows, 52 <em>picos</em> of 
sugar, which was worth P5 per <em>pico</em>. The damages resulting from the loss 
of sugar would be P260. The evidence relating to the other damages claimed is 
too indefinite upon which to base a finding.</p>
<p>It will be remembered that the defendants presented a general denial. They 
did not pray for affirmative relief. In view, however, of the conclusions which 
we have reached it is unnecessary to discuss the question whether a judgment for 
an affirmative relief can be based upon a general denial.</p>
<p>For the foregoing reasons, it is hereby ordered and decreed that the judgment 
of the lower court be reversed; that all the property which was taken possession 
of by the sheriff under the said foreclosure proceedings be returned to the 
plaintiffs if it has not already been done; that the bond theretofore given by 
the plaintiffs to secure possession of said property be cancelled; and that a 
judgment be rendered in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendant Yap 
Tico in the sum of P260, with interest at the rate of 6 per cent from the 8th 
day of March, 1915, and costs. So ordered.</p>

<p align="center"><em><strong>CONCURRING OPINION</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>CARSON, J.</strong>, <em>concurring</em>;</p>
<p>I concur.</p>
<p>I accept the ruling of the majority that, under all the circumstances of this 
case, payment of the mortgage indebtedness to the original mortgagee relieved 
the mortgagor of liability under the mortgage.</p>
<p>But I cannot give my assent to the dictum of the principal opinion to the 
effect that "if the law does not require a particular instrument to be recorded 
or registered, the recording of the instrument will not be constructive notice 
of its existence to any one."</p>
<p>As I read them, none of the cases or authorities cited in the principal 
opinion support that proposition.</p>
<p>The <em>ratio decidendi</em> of all these cases and authorities would seem to 
be that if the law does not <em>authorize</em> or <em>require</em> a particular 
instrument to be recorded or registered, the recording of that instrument will 
not be constructive notice of its existence to any one.</p>
<p>The distinction between the two propositions in this jurisdiction is Vital. 
Our statute, though it does not require the registry of transfers of chattel 
mortgages, expressly <em>authorizes</em> and <em>provides</em> for the registry 
of such transfers. (Sec. 15, "The Chattel Mortgage Law," Act No. 1508.)</p>
<p>A few citations (<em>italics mine</em>) from the authorities and leading 
cases mentioned in the majority opinion, will be sufficient, I think, to sustain 
my contention.</p>
<p>The doctrine announced in 5 Corpus Juris, section 77, page 909, is that:</p>
<p>"Where the statute does not <em>authorize</em> the registry of assignments of 
choses in action, the filing and recording of them imparts no notice to any 
one."</p>
<p>The ground of the decision in the case of Burck <em>vs</em>. Taylor (152 U. 
S., 634), as set forth in the syllabus was thatâ€”</p>
<p>"The filing of an instrument for record in a public office of a state, for 
the record of which the statute of the state <em>makes no provision</em>, 
carried with it no notice to other parties.</p>
<p>"If notice was essential to charge them, actual notice should have been 
given, at least in the absence of a statute <em>providing some means for 
constructive notice.</em>"</p>
<p>So, in the case of Dial <em>vs</em>. Inland Logging Company (52 Wash., 81), 
the court, in ruling upon the question we are now considering, said:</p>
<p>"We are not aware of any statute, and none has been called to our attention, 
<em>requiring</em> or <em>authorizing</em> the recording of an assignment of a 
lien of the character of the one in this case. In the absence of such a statute, 
the recording of the assignment to the respondent before the assignment to the 
appellant did not operate as constructive notice. It follows, therefore, that 
the appellant had neither actual nor constructive notice of the assignment to 
the respondent."</p>
<p>The elementary rule is stated as follows in Bouvier's Law Dictionary (Rawle's 
Revision, vol. 2, p. 849):</p>
<p>"But all conveyances and deeds which may be <em>de facto</em> recorded are 
not to be considered as giving notice: in order to have this effect, the 
instruments must be <em>such as are authorized to be recorded, and the registry 
must have been made in compliance with the law</em>, otherwise the registry is 
to be treated as a mere nullity, and it will not affect a subsequent purchaser 
or incumbrancer unless he has actual notice; (2 Sch. &amp; L., 68; 4 Wheat., 
466; 1 Johns. Ch., 300; 1 Story, Eq. Jur., sec. 403; 5 Me., 272) ; but <em>where 
a statute makes it discretionary to record an instrument, the effect of 
recording is in no wise lessened</em>, but is deemed a constructive notice the 
same as if the recording had been required" (77 Pa., 373).</p>
<p>The doctrine is set forth as follows in section 651 of Pomeroy's Equity 
Jurisprudence (vol. 2):</p>
<p>"<em>The form and kind of instrument</em>.â€”The record operates as a 
constructive notice only when the instrument itself is one of which the 
registration is required or authorized by the statute. The voluntary recording, 
therefore, of an instrument, when not authorized by the statute, would be a mere 
nullity, and would not charge subsequent purchasers with any notice of its 
contents or of any rights arising under it."</p>
<p>Our statute does not require the registry of transfers of chattel mortgages, 
but it expressly <em>authorizes</em> and <em>provides</em> for their registry in 
the public records, and the reasoning of all the authorities clearly indicate 
that when such a transfer is actually recorded in the manner and form provided 
by law, all persons, who thereafter acquire an interest in the mortgage or the 
mortgaged property, are charged with constructive notice of the transfer.</p>
<p>A contrary ruling would render of no practical effect the provisions of the 
statute authorizing and providing for the registry of transfers of chattel 
mortgages. It would mar the symmetry and utility of the law providing for the 
execution and registry of chattel mortgages. And all this without authority of 
law, and in reliance upon an erroneous interpretation and application of the 
doctrine announced by the authorities cited in support of the ruling.</p>
<p>From what has been said it seems clear that the ruling of the court in the 
case at bar, declaring that the registry of transfer of chattel mortgage did not 
charge the <em>mortgagor</em> with notice of the transfer, cannot be maintained, 
<em>on the ground that </em>our statute does not <em>require</em> the registry 
of such transfers. We must look elsewhere for the true ground upon which our 
disposition of this appeal can securely rest.</p>
<p>It affirmatively appears that the transfer of the mortgage from the mortgagee 
to the defendant, Yap Tico, was made soon after the date of the execution of the 
mortgage. That although Yap Tico recorded the transfer of the mortgage, he 
thereafter held himself out to the plaintiff (the mortgagor) as the agent of the 
mortgagee, and did in fact act as the agent of the mortgagee for the purpose of 
collecting payments upon the mortgage indebtedness, which payments, as it 
appears, were turned over to his principal, the mortgagee, or credited in his 
account with Yap Tico; that he continued to hold himself out as the agent of the 
mortgagee throughout the entire course of these transactions, and as such agent 
accepted on behalf of his principal a number of shipments of sugar, delivered by 
the mortgagor on account of his mortgage indebtedness and in strict compliance 
with the terms of the mortgage instrument; that the mortgagor had no actual 
notice of the transfer, of the mortgage until after he had paid the total amount 
of the mortgage indebtedness, the last payment being made to the mortgagee 
himself, in total ignorance of the transfer of the mortgagee's interest therein 
to the defendant, Yap Tico; and that it was not until after the mortgage 
indebtedness had been paid in full to the mortgagee that the defendant Yap Tico 
gave actual notice of the assignment of the mortgage, and demanded payment of 
the full amount of the indebtedness.</p>
<p>In the light of these facts, Yap Tico cannot be heard to demand payment of 
the mortgage indebtedness on the ground that he is entitled thereto as the 
registered assignee of the mortgage, and that payment to the mortgagee did not 
extinguish the debt. By his own conduct he is estopped from setting up such a 
claim. Having held himself out to be the agent of the mortgagee and accepted 
payment of the greater part of the indebtedness after the date of the 
assignment, in the name of and in behalf of the mortgagee, it is inconceivable 
that he should be permitted to enforce payment of the amounts thus collected a 
second time. And even as to the balance of the indebtedness paid directly to the 
mortgagee, it seems clear that Yap Tico is estopped from demanding repayment, 
because his own conduct was such as to lull any suspicion on the part of the 
debtor that the mortgage indebtedness had been assigned to him, and to justify 
the debtor in the belief that so far as he, Yap Tico, was concerned there was no 
reason to suspect the existence of the assignment or to search the records in 
order to ascertain the true nature of Yap Tico's relations with the mortgagee. 
In truth, Yap Tico's willful silence and failure to give actual notice of the 
assignment under all the circumstances fairly justifies the inference of an 
intent to defraud the mortgage debtor, and to take advantage of his lack of 
knowledge of the assignment to compel him to pay the amount of his indebtedness 
twice over.</p>
<p>What has been said completely and sufficiently disposes of the merits of the 
case actually before us, but in view of the general discussion as to the effect 
of the registry of an assignment of a mortgage in this jurisdiction, I deem it 
proper to direct attention to the question whether the assignee of a mortgage 
should, in any event, be permitted to recover from the mortgagor any part of the 
mortgage indebtedness paid to the mortgagee without <em>actual notice</em>. </p>
<p>The courts are not altogether uniform upon the question whether the record of 
an assignment should be held to amount to constructive notice to the mortgagor 
himself. Some of the courts have held that "the recording of an assignment of a 
mortgage will not give constructive notice thereof to the mortgagor, so as to 
invalidate subsequent payments on the mortgage debt made by him to the 
mortgagee, and that actual notice of the assignment is necessary to charge the 
mortgagor, except where the mortgage is security for a negotiable note." This, 
partly on the ground that the recording of such an instrument operates merely as 
constructive notice to <em>subsequent</em> purchasers, and partly on the ground 
that, except where the debt is evidenced by a negotiable instrument, search of 
the record should not be necessary every time a payment of principle or interest 
is made on the mortgage indebtedness. Some States have made express provisions 
to this effect by statute. In others the record of an assignment is held to be 
'notice to the mortgagor as well as to subsequent purchasers. (<em>See</em> 
cases cited in notes to textbook authorities cited below.) But I do not deem it 
necessary to express an opinion at this time as to what should be the rule in 
this regard in this jurisdiction, and merely invite attention to the question, 
lest it might be assumed that my general observations as to the legal effect of 
the registry of an assignment in this jurisdiction foreclose this question so 
far as I am concerned. I regard it as still open. (<em>See</em> discussion of 
this question in sec. 480, Jones on Mortgages, vol. 1, 7th ed., and sec. 649 of 
Pomeroy's Equity Jurisprudence, vol. 2, 3d ed.)</p>
<p>
</p><hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1">

<p align="center"><em><strong>CONCURRING OPINION</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>STREET, J.</strong>, <em>concurring</em>:</p>
<p>I concur in the result attained in this case and desire to express the 
reasons upon which my conclusion is based. The case presented is that where the 
mortgagor named in a chattel mortgage has paid the mortgage debt to the 
mortgagee without being informed that the credit had been assigned. The assignee 
now seeks to enforce the mortgage against the property and thus in effect to 
compel the mortgagor to pay the debt a second time.</p>
<p>Section 4 of the Chattel Mortgage Law (Act No. 1508) contains the following 
language:</p>
<p>"A chattel mortgage shall not be valid against any person except the 
mortgagor, his executors or administrators, unless the possession of the 
property is delivered to and retained by the mortgagee or unless the mortgage is 
recorded in the office of the register of deeds, etc."</p>
<p>Section 15 of the same Act contains the following language:</p>
<p>"Every register of deeds shall keep a book of records of chattel mortgages; 
shall certify on each mortgage left for record the date, hour and minute when 
the same was by him received; record in such book any chattel mortgage, 
transfer, or discharge, and the officer's return of sale upon any mortgage, 
etc."</p>
<p>Under the provision first above-quoted, the mortgage, it will be noted, is 
valid as against the mortgager, his executors or administrators, without the 
necessity of being recorded in any case. Under section 15 it is expressly 
required that the officer who keeps the record of chattel mortgages shall record 
therein the documents mentioned; and so far as the performance of this 
ministerial duty is concerned there is evidently the same authority for 
recording the transfer, or assignment, of a chattel mortgage as there is for 
recording the chattel mortgage itself. In section 4, as we have seen, the effect 
of a failure to register the chattel mortgage is denned in the statement that an 
unregistered chattel mortgage shall not be valid except as against the 
mortgagor. There is no provision in the Act defining the effect of either the 
registration or nonregistration of a transfer of a mortgage, and this point must 
be determined by reference to general principles.</p>
<p>The Chattel Mortgage Law was adopted by the Philippine Commission from the 
laws relative to registration prevailing in the States of the American Union; 
and the problem presented in the present case is therefore one arising upon the 
interpretation of an Act applying the principles of that system to these 
Islands. It may be well to explain in a word that, according to the common-law 
ideas, registration is merely a species of notice. The act of registering a 
document is never necessary in order to give it legal effect between the 
parties. The purpose of the Legislature in providing a system of registration is 
to afford means of publicity so that persons dealing with property may search 
the records and thereby acquire security against instruments the execution of 
which has not been revealed.</p>
<p>We find the general principle applicable in the case now before us formulated 
in a well-known encyclopedic work as follows:</p>
<p>"The recording of an assignment of a mortgage will not usually give 
constructive notice thereof to the mortgagor so as to invalidate subsequent 
payments on the mortgage debt made by him to the mortgagee. Actual notice of 
such assignment is necessary to bind the mortgagor, except where the mortgage 
secures a negotiable note." (Am. Eng. Encyc. Law, 2d ed., vol. 24, p. 148.)</p>
<p>It is sometimes stated in the decisions that the recording of a conveyance is 
notice to all the world, but this is too broad; and the more accurate statement 
is that the record imparts constructive notice to such persons only as would 
have been entitled to protection against the conveyance in case it had not been 
recorded, or, in other words, to such persons as are under a legal obligation to 
search for it. The operation of the record is prospective and not retrospective. 
It is only a subsequent conveyance which defeats a prior unrecorded conveyance, 
and therefore only persons who acquire their rights subsequently to the 
registration can be said to be charged with notice of a recorded conveyance. 
(Am. &amp; Eng. Encyc. Law, 2d ed., vol. 24, p. 146.) The doctrine thus stated 
is fully and absolutely sustained by a great number of American authorities, of 
which a few are here mentioned. (George <em>vs</em>. Wood, 9 Allen [Mass.], 80, 
85 Am. Dec, 741; Foster vs. Carson, 159 Pa. St., 477, 39 Am. St. Rep., 696; 
Murphy <em>vs</em>. Barnard, 162 Mass., 72, 44 Am. St. Rep., 340; White 
<em>vs</em>. McGregor, 92 Tex., 556, 71 Am. St. Rep., 875; Lynchburg Perpetual 
Building, etc., Co. <em>vs</em>. Fellers, 96 Va., 337, 70 Am. St. Rep., 
851.)</p>
<p>Of course, it would have been competent for the Legislature to declare that 
the registration of the transfer of a mortgage should operate as constructive 
notice to prior parties as well as subsequent purchasers; but we have never seen 
any enacted law in which a rule so sweeping has been declared. In the absence of 
such a provision it is apparent that registration should be considered 
prospective in its operation, as indicated in the authorities already cited.</p>
<p>The doctrine of the civil law, as expressed in article 1527 of the Civil 
Code, is entirely accordant with the view just expressed, for it is there stated 
that a debtor who, before having knowledge of the assignment, should pay the 
creditor shall be released from the obligation. This article is in no wise 
modified by anything in Act No. 1508, and we think it furnishes a general rule 
for the guidance of the courts in determining the application of the provisions 
of that Act upon the point now before us.</p>

undersigned, the result reached in this case should be based on the proposition 
that, although the recording of a transfer of a chattel mortgage is authorized 
under the law, such Act does not affect the original debtor with 
notice.</p></div>
