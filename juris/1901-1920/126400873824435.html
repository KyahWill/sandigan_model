				<H3>MUERTEGUY & ABOITIZ, PLAINTIFFS AND APPELLEES, VS. ISIDORO V. DELGADO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.

				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The purpose of the present appeal is to have  the judgment of the Court of First  Instance of the Province  of Leyte set aside, for the reason that neither  the defendant nor his attorney had  any notice of the time fixed for the trial of said cause, and for that reason were  not present at the trial.</p>
<p>The record shows that on the 19th of August, 1909, the plaintiff commenced an action against the  defendant for the purpose of recovering the sum of P4,161.57.  On the 1st of October, 1909, the defendant demurred  to said action, which demurrer was overruled upon the 29th of November, 1909.  After duly excepting to the ruling of  the  court, the defendant filed his answer  upon the 22d of January, 1910.</p>
<p>It appears that upon the 26th of April, 1910,  the cause was set down  for  trial.  On the 29th of April,  1910, the Honorable  Charles  A, Low rendered a judgment in said cause  in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant for the sum of P4,163.07, with costs.</p>
<p>Neither  the defendant nor  his attorney  was  present at the trial of the cause.  The  record  clearly shows that the defendant had no notice that the cause had been  set down for trial on a particular day.  The record shows that after the commencement of  the  trial, the attorney  for  the defendant  was notified that the trial was proceeding,  but by reason  of other engagements it was  impossible for him to be present during even a part of the time of the trial. Parties have  a right to be present at the trial of their causes either  by themselves or by their attorneys. They are also entitled to reasonable notice of the time fixed  for the trial of their cause.  For the reason, therefore, that the defendant had no opportunity to  be present  at  the time of the trial of the present cause and to present  his defenses, the  judgment  of the lower court is hereby  set aside and  a new trial  is hereby ordered.  It is  further ordered that the cause be returned to the lower court with direction that a new trial be ordered and that the defendant be given due notice thereof;  and without any finding as to costs it is so ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C, J.,  Torres, Mapa,  Carson, Moreland,</em> and <em>Trent, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
