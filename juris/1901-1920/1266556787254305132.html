				<BR><STRONG>TRENT, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p></p><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of the Province of Batangas,&nbsp; Honorable Mariano Cui presiding, condemning the defendant to four months and one day of <i>arresto mayor</i> and to indemnify the offended party in the&nbsp; amount of P57, and&nbsp; to subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to the payment of the costs of the cause, for the crime of <em>lesiones menos graves.</em><p> The&nbsp; facts are these:&nbsp; There had been some trouble between the family of the appellant and that of the offended party prior to the occurrences which form the basis of this action.&nbsp; On the 18th of September, 1910, the offended party, Benita Soyso, sent her small son to the house of the accused for the purpose of obtaining a <em>bolo</em> which her husband had loaned to the husband of the&nbsp; accused. On arrival of the messenger at the house, he found that neither the accused nor her husband was there, and on asking Filomena, daughter of the&nbsp; accused, for the <i>bolo</i>, Filomena replied by saying that she knew&nbsp; nothing about&nbsp; it.&nbsp;&nbsp; The offended party, on hearing this&nbsp; reply (her house and that of the accused being opposite and very&nbsp; near each other), began abusing Filomena, calling her vile names.&nbsp; The accused and her husband being&nbsp; in a neighbor's house&nbsp; nearby,&nbsp; heard these insulting words, and thereupon the accused left the house where&nbsp; she was and appeared in&nbsp; front of that&nbsp; of Benita Soyso&nbsp; and demanded&nbsp; of&nbsp; the latter an explanation of the insult to her daughter Filomena.&nbsp; A quarrel ensued between Benita and the accused, in which abusive language was exchanged.&nbsp; The accused&nbsp; becoming very&nbsp; angry and very much excited, and having in her hand at that time a short working <em>bolo</em>, entered the house of Benita and began&nbsp; striking her with the bolo.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result of the wounds inflicted, Benita was incapacitated and required medical attendance for a period&nbsp; of fifteen days.&nbsp; The court below, in fixing the penalty imposed, took into consideration the aggravating circumstance&nbsp; of <em>morada</em>, inasmuch as the crime was committed in the&nbsp; house of the offended party. In this we think the court erred.</p><p> Article 10 of the Penal Code reads:</p><blockquote>"The following&nbsp; are aggravating circumstances:<p></p></blockquote><p align="center">&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p><blockquote>"No. 20.&nbsp; That the act be&nbsp; committed with insult&nbsp; or&nbsp; in disregard of the respect due the offended party on account of his rank, age,&nbsp; or sex, or that it be committed in the dwelling of the offended party, if the latter has not given provocation."<p></p></blockquote>In the case at bar the offended party, by calling Filomena vile names, started&nbsp; the trouble.&nbsp; This vile language was not directed at the accused, but to her daughter.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was, however,&nbsp; a&nbsp; sufficient provocation to cause&nbsp; the&nbsp; accused&nbsp; to demand an&nbsp; explanation why&nbsp; her daughter&nbsp; was so grossly insulted.&nbsp; So,&nbsp; under these facts, it was error to hold that the&nbsp; aggravating circumstance of <em>morada</em> existed.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Decision of the supreme court of Spain, October 24,&nbsp; 1894.)<br>&nbsp; <br>The accused was a woman about fifty years of age.&nbsp; She heard&nbsp; her single daughter grossly insulted.&nbsp;&nbsp; She appeared in front of the house of Benita and demanded an explanation.&nbsp; The explanation was not forthcoming, and a quarrel immediately ensued&nbsp; between&nbsp; these two women.&nbsp; The accused&nbsp; was laboring&nbsp; under great excitement and&nbsp; passion when she entered the house of Benita and inflicted the wounds.&nbsp;&nbsp; These facts&nbsp; should be&nbsp; considered as a&nbsp; circumstance mitigating the offense.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Art. 9, No. 7, Penal Code,) There being no aggravating circumstances present, and one mitigating circumstance, the penalty should have been imposed in its minimum degree.<p></p><p> The judgment appealed from is hereby modified by imposing upon the appellant a penalty of one month and one day of <em>arresto mayor,</em> instead of four months and one day of <em>arresto mayor</em>.&nbsp; As thus modified, the judgment is affirmed, with costs against the appellant.</p><p><em>Arellano, C. J., Mapa, Johnson</em>, and <em>Carson, JJ.</em>,&nbsp; concur.<br></p></div>
