That in this action there has been issued&nbsp; an order of arrest for each of&nbsp; the defendants,&nbsp; and each and every one of them&nbsp; has been held&nbsp; to answer for&nbsp; a criminal offense to wit,&nbsp; the&nbsp; crime of libel without there&nbsp; having been had any preliminary investigation before any&nbsp; court, and without any tribunal, judge,&nbsp; magistrate, or other competent authority having determined in&nbsp; accordance with law that the&nbsp; alleged crime of libel has been committed,&nbsp; and that there pxist reasonable motives to believe that all&nbsp; and each of the&nbsp; defendants&nbsp; are guilty of the&nbsp; crime charged; this in violation of sections 12 and 13 of General Orders, No. 58, issued by the Office of the Military Governor of the United States in the Philippine Islands&nbsp; on April 23, 1900, and the&nbsp; first, third,&nbsp; eleventh, and eighteenth paragraphs of section 5 of the Philippine Bill, approved by the United States Congress July 1, 1902.<br><br>"2.

That section 2 of the above-mentioned Act No. 612, which deprives accused persons in the city of Manila of the right to demand a preliminary investigation, is contrary to the provisions&nbsp; of&nbsp; section&nbsp; 5 of the said Philippine Bill for the following reasons:<br><br>"(<i>a</i>) Because it prescribes that persons who find themselves&nbsp; in&nbsp; the city of Manila may be&nbsp; deprived of their liberty 'without due process of law/&nbsp; (Par. 1.)<br><br>"(<i>b</i>) Because it denies to the inhabitants of the city of Manila the legal protection of the preliminary investigation before being deprived of their liberty that is conceded by the said General Orders, No. 58, said order being in force in all the Islands for&nbsp; the benefit of all persons, and in the city of Manila for the plaintiffs and for the courts, and therefore denies equal protection to all before the law.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Par. 1.)<br><br>"(<i>c</i>) Because it deprives persons held&nbsp; in the city&nbsp; of Manila to answer for a criminal offense&nbsp; of the guaranty of previous 'due process of law.'&nbsp;&nbsp; (Par. 3.)<br><br>"(<i>d</i>) Because it violates the right to be secure against unreasonable seizures.&nbsp; (Par. 11.)<br><br>"Wherefore the&nbsp; petitioners pray the court to revoke the order of&nbsp; arrest issued in this cause upon each of them, to release them, and&nbsp; in consequence to cancel the bail&nbsp; which each one has furnished to this court to secure his release, and further to abstain from any proceedings in this case until previous 'due process of law' brings the cause within the jurisdiction of this court to try it."</blockquote>On the&nbsp; 10th&nbsp; day of November,&nbsp; 1908,&nbsp; the&nbsp; prosecuting attorney answered the foregoing motion in writing, which is as follows:<br><blockquote>"Now comes the undersigned&nbsp; assistant prosecuting attorney for the city of Manila, and in answer to the motion of the&nbsp; accused herein to dismiss this cause, respectfully submits that the same&nbsp; should be overruled for the following reasons, to wit:<br><br>"(1)&nbsp; Because the information&nbsp; shows upon its face that a preliminary examination was held upon the charge alleged in said&nbsp; information, by the prosecuting attorney, in accordance with Act No. 612&nbsp; of the Philippine Commission.<br><br>"(2)&nbsp; Because there is no law&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Philippine Islands requiring the judges of the Courts of First Instance of the city of Manila to hold preliminary investigations in criminal causes,&nbsp; and issue orders of probable cause, where the prosecuting attorney, after due investigation of the facts, as&nbsp; in this case, has presented an information against the accused, in proper form.<br><br>" (3)&nbsp; Because the accused have waived any rights which they may have had to&nbsp; object to any defects or irregularity in the warrants of arrest, by appearing&nbsp; before the&nbsp; court and&nbsp; giving bond&nbsp; for their several appearance before said court at a subsequent day of the term, to answer to the information against them.<br><br>"It is therefore respectfully submitted that&nbsp; the motion should be overruled and the defendants required to&nbsp; plead to the information."<br></blockquote>After hearing the arguments upon the above motion&nbsp; to quash the proceedings,&nbsp; the Hon. Charles H. Smith, then one of the judges of the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, rendered the following decision:<br><blockquote>"The information was presented in this case on the 5th day of November, 1908, and was accompanied, as shown by the files in this case, by two affidavits of Mr. L.

Southworth, assistant prosecuting attorney of the city of Manila, in the first of which the said prosecuting&nbsp; attorney swears to said information, and&nbsp; in the second of which the said official swore that he had practiced the preliminary investigation in the office of the prosecuting attorney of the city of Manila prescribed by section 39 of Act No. 183 of the honorable Philippine Commission, being the charter of the city of Manila, as amended by section 2 of Act No. 612 of said Commission.&nbsp; Said affidavits were&nbsp; signed and&nbsp; sworn&nbsp; to before the judge presiding over the criminal branch of this court.&nbsp;&nbsp; A warrant&nbsp; was thereupon issued for the arrest of the defendants who,&nbsp; in pursuance of said warrant, were brought into the court on the same day, the said information was&nbsp; read to them and they were&nbsp; allowed&nbsp; until&nbsp; the morning of the 7th day of November to plead thereto.&nbsp; At the conclusion of the reading of said complaint the defendants, with the assistance&nbsp; of their counsel, all presented a bail bond in the sum of Pl,000 each, and were then released from custody, being ordered to&nbsp; return to court the morning of the&nbsp; said 7th day of November.&nbsp; At the&nbsp; time last before mentioned the defendants with their counsel all appeared in court and presented in writing a motion to quash the proceedings herein, which motion is based upon two propositions:&nbsp; (1) That the preliminary investigation required by law has not been practiced in this court; (2) that no specific order has been issued by the court in which it&nbsp; has been determined that the crime complained of has been committed and that there is reasonable ground&nbsp; to&nbsp; believe that the parties charged have committed such crime.<br><br>"1.&nbsp; The charge in this case is a violation of the provisions of chapter 297 of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Compiled Laws of the Philippine Commission.&nbsp; The punishment prescribed&nbsp; for&nbsp; such violation is 'a fine of not exceeding four thousand pesos, or imprisonment not exceeding one&nbsp; year, or both, so that the case is&nbsp; only triable in this&nbsp; court.&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 13&nbsp; of General Orders, No. 58 (being section 3261 of the Compiled Laws), provides that - <br><br>" 'When a complaint or information alleging the commission of a crime is laid before a magistrate, he must examine, on&nbsp; oath,&nbsp; the&nbsp; informant or prosecutor and the&nbsp; witnesses produced, and take&nbsp; their&nbsp; depositions&nbsp; in writing,&nbsp; causing them&nbsp; to be subscribed by the parties making them.&nbsp; If the magistrate be&nbsp; satisfied from the investigation that the crime complained of has been committed, and that&nbsp; there is reasonable ground to believe that the party charged has committed it, he must issue an order for his arrest.&nbsp; If the offense be bailable, and&nbsp; the defendant&nbsp; offer a sufficient security, he shatl&nbsp; be admitted to bail; otherwise he shall be committed to prison.'<br><br>"This&nbsp; was&nbsp; the law&nbsp; promulgated&nbsp; during the&nbsp; military government of the Philippine Islands under American sover-eignty,&nbsp; and after the establishment of the civil&nbsp; government&nbsp; here and the volume of business in&nbsp; this court was found to be substantially larger than was anticipated, the law hereinbefore mentioned was&nbsp; enacted by the honorable Philippine Commission to furnish relief to this court in the city of&nbsp; Manila.&nbsp; Thereupon&nbsp; such relief was&nbsp; provided by means of Act No. 612 of said Commission, the second section of which, so far as the same is applicable to this case, is as fallows:<br><br>" 'In cases triable in&nbsp; the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, the defendant shall have a speedy trial, but shall not be entitled as of right to a preliminary examination in any case where the prosecuting attorney, after a due investigation of the facts,&nbsp; under&nbsp; section thirty-nine of the Act of which this is an amendment, shall have presented an information against him in proper form: Provided, however, That&nbsp; the Court of First Instance may make such summary investigation&nbsp; into the&nbsp; case as it&nbsp; may&nbsp; deem necessary to enable it to fix the bail or to determine whether the offense is bailable.'<br><br>"The validity of this law and the sufficiency of the provisions thereof in the matter of criminal procedure treated therein were submitted to and considered by the honorable Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands&nbsp; in&nbsp; a very able decision of&nbsp; that court in the case entitled&nbsp; 'United States, complainant, <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. William A. Wilson, defendant/ reported in volume 4 of the Philippine Reports, English&nbsp; edition, at page 317, etc.&nbsp; In a&nbsp; very studious examination of said last-mentioned case,&nbsp; the honorable Supreme Court determined that a preliminary investigation conducted by the&nbsp; prosecuting attorney of the city of Manila or his assistants, in pursuance of the provisions of such section 2 of said Act No. 612, was sufficient to meet the requirements of the law operative in the Philippine Islands in the matter of preliminary investigations,&nbsp; and that no&nbsp; further investigation is required&nbsp; to&nbsp; be made by the magistrate, who in the city of Manila is the trial judge.<br><br>"It appears of record in the case at bar that the assistant prosecuting attorney of&nbsp; the city&nbsp; of Manila has practiced in the office of the prosecuting attorney of said city the preliminary investigation required by&nbsp; law.&nbsp; This is shown by&nbsp; his&nbsp; sworn statement annexed&nbsp; to said information and sworn to by him before the trial judge here.&nbsp;&nbsp; Under these circumstances and being governed by the rule promulgated by&nbsp; the honorable Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands in the said&nbsp; Wilson&nbsp; case,&nbsp; the court must and does overrule said motion as to the said first proposition.<br><br>"2. A specific separate order of the&nbsp; court as to probable cause, etc., is no longer required by law in&nbsp; criminal causes (felonies) instituted in this court (city of Manila).&nbsp; The practice prescribed in said section of&nbsp; General&nbsp; Orders, No. 68, was only required in cases in which the&nbsp; preliminary investigations therein were conducted by the trial judge or magistrate; in&nbsp; fact, said section&nbsp; of&nbsp; General&nbsp; Orders, No. 58, does not provide that a written order to this end must be made by such magistrate.&nbsp; However, as to&nbsp; the city&nbsp; of Manila, said practice has been entirely substituted by section 2 of said Act No. 612, the prosecuting attorney of the city of Manila, according to the provisions of section 486 of the Compiled Laws (sec. 39, Act No. 183 of the Commission), is a&nbsp; judicial officer, having full&nbsp; authority&nbsp; to&nbsp; make&nbsp; preliminary investigations and&nbsp; present informations in all criminal cases, and when he&nbsp; as&nbsp; such officer&nbsp; presents&nbsp; in court an information sworn to by him accompanied by an affidavit that he has practiced the preliminary investigation required by law,&nbsp; in pursuance of&nbsp; said Act No. 612, and takes such&nbsp; oaths before the magistrate, who is the judge presiding1 over this (criminal)&nbsp; branch of the court, probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, appears of record in the case.&nbsp; <i>In reality at the time of&nbsp; the presentation&nbsp; of said information,&nbsp; together with said&nbsp; affidavits, the&nbsp; trial judge (magistrate) considered and determined that probable cause, etc.,&nbsp; had been shown</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The issuance of the warrant signed by the same magistrate or trial&nbsp; judge must&nbsp; be&nbsp; considered as&nbsp; a&nbsp; determination on the part&nbsp; of the court or magistrate as to probable cause, etc., if such a determination is now necessary&nbsp; under&nbsp; the&nbsp; amended&nbsp; laws applicable&nbsp; to this&nbsp; feature of the case.&nbsp; Through the assistance of defendants' counsel&nbsp; a bail bond&nbsp; was provided by them&nbsp; and approved by the court&nbsp; at the&nbsp; time&nbsp; of&nbsp; the reading of the complaint and one&nbsp; and one-half days before the presentation of the motion.&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the rule laid down in text-books and in the American&nbsp; and English Encyclopedia of Law, the questions raised in said&nbsp; motion&nbsp; are unseasonable.<br><br>"In the said Wilson case, the honorable Supreme Court considered this very question, and there not appearing in the record a specific order of the trial judge (magistrate) as to probable cause, the Supreme Court held that the same is not now an indispensable legal step in&nbsp; a&nbsp; criminal cause instituted in this court&nbsp; (city of Manila).<br><br>"During the last two years it&nbsp; has&nbsp; been impossible to conduct preliminary investigations before the judge (magistrate)&nbsp; presiding over criminal sala,&nbsp; and&nbsp; it has not&nbsp; been considered necessary in view of the doctrine promulgated by the honorable Supreme Court of the Philippine&nbsp; Islands in the said&nbsp; Wilson case.&nbsp; The rule of procedure approved and settled in the said last-mentioned case has been followed by all the judges&nbsp; presiding over this branch of the court, and very properly so in view of the great magnitude of business pressed upon the court for its attention.<br><br>"<i>Following and being governed by the interpretation of the law as found in the said decision of the honorable Supreme Court</i> of the Philippine Islands, this court must and does overrule the said motion as to the said second proposition.<br><br>"It is&nbsp; therefore ordered that&nbsp; said motion be denied and that the&nbsp; defendants each and all plead to said information forthwith."</blockquote>The defendants&nbsp; duly&nbsp; excepted to this order denying said motion.<br><br>On the 10th of November, 1908, the defendants presented another motion as follows:<br><blockquote>"Come&nbsp; now Martin Ocampo, Teodoro M. Kalaw, Lope K. Santos, Fidel A. Reyes, and Faustino Aguilar, defendants in the present cause and, without intending this motion to mean they renounce anything they set forth in their&nbsp; motion of the 7th instant,&nbsp; and in their exception taken to the denial thereof,&nbsp; which&nbsp; they here maintain in&nbsp; all&nbsp; its parts and efficacy, respectfully pray the court that there&nbsp; be exhibited to the court and to the defendants the preliminary examination alleged&nbsp; to have been held&nbsp; by the acting prosecuting attorney for the city of Manila,&nbsp; and until the accused&nbsp; have not been so&nbsp; investigated, they pray that they be not obliged to present any dilatory plea or answer to the complaint.<br><br>"This prayer is based on the following propositions:<br><br>"(1)&nbsp; That said&nbsp; preliminary investigation is&nbsp; the basis of the action,&nbsp; and should show&nbsp; therein&nbsp; the&nbsp; nature,&nbsp; form, origin, and motive of the charge.<br><br>" (2) That each and all&nbsp; of the accused&nbsp; desire, need, and have the right to be duly and fully informed of the nature, form, origin, and motive of the charge before they present any dilatory plea or answer the complaint, in conformity with the provisions of the second paragraph of section 5 of the Philippine Bill, approved July 1,&nbsp; 1902, by the Congress of the United States, and section 15, paragraph 2, of General Orders, No. 58, published on April 23, 1900, by the Office of the Military Governor of the United States in the Philippine Islands."</blockquote>This&nbsp; motion was decided by the court in the following language:<br><blockquote>"A motion is presented in this case&nbsp; by defendants' counsel for an order of the&nbsp; court requiring the prosecuting attorney to place before the court and the defendants, the whole of the preliminary investigation conducted&nbsp; in this case in the office of the prosecuting attorney.<br><br>"1. The charge in this case is libel; violation of Act No. 277&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Philippine Commission.&nbsp;&nbsp; The published article complained of is set out in full in the information,&nbsp; so that no one can be misguided or deceived&nbsp; as to the&nbsp; character of the crime complained of.<br><br>"2. The prosecuting attorney of the&nbsp; city of Manila is, by the&nbsp; law governing that&nbsp; office,&nbsp; a judicial&nbsp; officer.&nbsp; His duties&nbsp; in&nbsp; the matter of&nbsp; preliminary&nbsp; investigations&nbsp; are prescribed by law, to wit:&nbsp; Act No.&nbsp; 612 of the honorable Philippine Commission; likewise section 486 of the compiled Laws of the Philippine&nbsp; Islands.&nbsp; His duties are separate and distinct from those of the court.&nbsp;&nbsp; In each of these two branches of&nbsp; the judiciary there are&nbsp; plain limitations prescribed by law.&nbsp; The court has grave doubt, upon the refusal of the&nbsp; prosecuting attorney to&nbsp; present such information in compliance with the order of the court, that said prosecuting attorney could be punished for a&nbsp; violation of the order of the court.<br><br>"3. The question&nbsp; submitted&nbsp; in this motion&nbsp; was&nbsp; clearly settled in the case of the United States <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Wilson, reported in the fourth volume of the Philippine Reports.&nbsp; The rules promulgated in&nbsp; that case&nbsp; must govern this court in the application of the law here now.&nbsp; Besides this, no showing has been made, and it has not been claimed, that the prosecuting attorney has refused&nbsp; to give the information sought, upon application therefor.<br><br>"4.&nbsp; If the motion presented at this time could have merit at any stage of the case, it is inopportune now.<br><br>"The&nbsp; motion&nbsp; is&nbsp; therefore&nbsp; denied&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants ordered to plead."<br></blockquote>To this ruling&nbsp; of the court the defendants duly excepted. On&nbsp; the&nbsp; 12th&nbsp; day of November, 1908,&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants presented another motion, as follows:<br><blockquote>"Come now&nbsp; Teodoro M. Kalaw, Fidel A. Reyes, Lope K. Santos, Faustino Aguilar, and Martin Ocampo, the defendants in the present cause, and respectfully pray the court to hold a preliminary investigation in the present cause before the defendants present any&nbsp; dilatory&nbsp; plea or answer the complaint.<br><br>"This&nbsp; motion&nbsp; is based upon the&nbsp; provisions of General Orders, No. 58, and in section&nbsp; 5 of the Philippine Bill, and other laws of the Philippine Commission which concede to all accused persons the right to a preliminary investigation, and also that the provisions of section 2&nbsp; of Act No. 612, which deny to accused persons in the city of Manila such right,&nbsp; are void and unconstitutional, being in open contradiction to the provisions of the said section 5 of the Philippine Bill in its&nbsp; paragraphs 1, 3, 11, and 18."</blockquote>This motion&nbsp; was opposed by the prosecuting attorney in the following language:<br><blockquote>"Section 2 of Act No. 612, in part,&nbsp; provides:<br><br>" 'In cases triable only in the Court of First Instance in the city of Manila, the defendant shall have a speedy trial, but shall not be entitled as of right to a preliminary examination in any&nbsp; case where the prosecuting attorney,&nbsp; after a&nbsp; due&nbsp; investigation of the facts, under&nbsp; section thirty-nine of the Act&nbsp; of which this&nbsp; is&nbsp; an amendment, shall&nbsp; have presented an&nbsp; information against him in&nbsp; proper&nbsp; form: <i>Provided, however</i>, That the Court of First Instance may make such&nbsp; summary&nbsp; investigation into the case as it may deem&nbsp; necessary to enable it to fix the&nbsp; bail or to determine whether the offense is bailable.'<br><br>"The sole purpose&nbsp; of this&nbsp; provision of said Act was to change the law in regard to&nbsp; preliminary investigations, as it then&nbsp; existed in General&nbsp; Orders,&nbsp; No. 58, and thereby remove the necessity for such investigation by the judges of the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the contention of counsel, that it is necessary for the judges of the Court of First Instance to hold&nbsp; preliminary&nbsp; examinations before issuing warrants of arrest, notwithstanding the fact that preliminary examinations have already been held by&nbsp; the prosecuting&nbsp; attorney in accordance&nbsp; with&nbsp; law,&nbsp; be correct, then the provisions of Act No. 612, above referred to,&nbsp; are rendered perfectly nugatory,&nbsp; and its purpose absolutely&nbsp; defeated. It was the duty of the&nbsp; prosecuting at torney under&nbsp; Act No.&nbsp; 183,&nbsp; to which Act&nbsp; No. 612 is an amendment, to investigate all crimes and misdemeanors occurring in the&nbsp; city of Manila, and to prepare and present complaints and informations&nbsp; to the proper courts, but to these investigations there is not given such solemnity under Act No.&nbsp; 183 as to render subsequent investigations by the court before issuing warrants of arrest unnecessary.<br><br>"The lawmaking body in passing Act No.&nbsp; 612 evidently had a twofold purpose in view, namely:<br><br>"(1)&nbsp; To prevent the publicity which was necessarily incident to&nbsp; such investigations before the&nbsp; judge&nbsp; in&nbsp; open court.<br><br>"(2)&nbsp; To expedite&nbsp; the criminal business in the&nbsp; Court of First Instance&nbsp; in the city of Manila&nbsp; (with&nbsp; dockets&nbsp; usually crowded) by having&nbsp; these preliminary examinations held by the prosecuting attorney.<br><br>"The Supreme Court of the&nbsp; Philippine Islands has expressly decided that it&nbsp; is not necessary for the judges of the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of the city of&nbsp; Manila to hold preliminary investigations, when an information is presented by the prosecuting attorney, certifying that a preliminary investigation has been held by him.&nbsp; (See U. S. <i> </i><span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span><i>.</i> Wilson, vol. 4, Phil. Rep., p. 317.)<br><br>"The second contention of counsel that it is&nbsp; necessary for the judges of the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First Instance of the city of Manila to issue an order, finding that probable cause exists, before issuing warrants of arrest, is equally&nbsp; as untenable. It would be impossible for the judge to issue an order saying that he found probable cause to exist unless he personally conducted&nbsp; the&nbsp; preliminary examination.&nbsp;&nbsp; He&nbsp; would have nothing upon which to base the order.&nbsp; It might be said that the judge could issue the order upon the faith of the preliminary examination held by the prosecuting&nbsp; attorney, as certified to in the information.&nbsp; If&nbsp; this be true, if the judge has the right to accept the preliminary&nbsp; examination made by the prosecuting attorney, and&nbsp; from it, as certified in the information, find that probable cause exists, then the court has found that probable cause exists in&nbsp; this case by the issuance of the warrants of arrest.&nbsp; But conceding that it was absolutely&nbsp; necessary for&nbsp; the&nbsp; court to&nbsp; hold&nbsp; a preliminary examination; that it was absolutely necessary for the court to find that probable cause existed before issuing the warrants of arrest, these matters could only render the arrest illegal, and it is perfectly&nbsp; immaterial as to whether the arrest is legal or illegal.&nbsp; The defendants are before the court, and&nbsp; the court has the legal right to try them upon&nbsp; a valid information.&nbsp; The courts have held&nbsp; that if a party is arrested&nbsp; without warrant and brought before a&nbsp; court of competent&nbsp; jurisdiction,&nbsp; that the&nbsp; court&nbsp; will proceed to&nbsp; try the accused&nbsp; notwithstanding the illegality of the arrest. The books&nbsp; are&nbsp; full of cases where aecttsed have been kidnaped beyond the jurisdiction in which the charges were filed against them and brought back and tried.<br><br>"The&nbsp; validity of prosecutions&nbsp; by information has been sustained by the United States Supreme Court m the following cases:&nbsp; Hurtado&nbsp; <i>vs</i>. People of California&nbsp; (110&nbsp; U. S., 516) ; McNulty <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. California (149 U.&nbsp; S.,&nbsp; 645) ; and again, in the case of Hawaii <i>vs.</i> Mankichi (190 U. S., 197).<br><br>"In an elaborate and well-considered opinion,&nbsp; the supreme court of New Mexico holds that an information presented by a prosecuting officer is a sufficient finding&nbsp; of probable cause to authorize a court to issue a warrant of arrest,&nbsp; although the information is not sworn to.&nbsp;&nbsp; (See Territory&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Cutinola, 4 New Mex. Rep., 305.)<br><br>"In volume 30 of the American and English Encyclopedia of Law, page 86, it is stated:<br><br>" 'Where an information states an offense, and is sworn to positively by&nbsp; some person,&nbsp; it is sufficient of itself to authorize a&nbsp; clerk to issue a warrant for the arrest of the defendant without any finding by the clerk or other person of probable cause to believe the defendant guilty.'<br><br>"Conceding&nbsp; again, for the sake&nbsp; of&nbsp; argument, that the warrants&nbsp; in this case are&nbsp; void because no probable cause was&nbsp; found by the court before issuing them, the accused have waived all their rights to object&nbsp; to&nbsp; the same&nbsp; by appearing and giving bond.&nbsp; 'Giving bond waives&nbsp; defects in issuance&nbsp; of&nbsp; process&nbsp; for arrest."&nbsp; (2&nbsp; Humphrey (Tenn.), 445; 15 Barb.&nbsp; (N. Y.), 26; 24 Vermont, 506.) <br><br>"It is respectfully submitted that the motion&nbsp; should be overruled, and the accused required to plead to&nbsp; the information."</blockquote>Upon a due consideration of said motion and the arguments presented, the judge of the lower court rendered a decision denying the same, in the following language:<br><blockquote>"The&nbsp; defendants are all&nbsp; present in court; likewise their counsel and counsel for the Government.<br><br>"The information was read in this cause on the 5th&nbsp; day of November,&nbsp; at which time the&nbsp; defendants were ordered to appear in court on the morning of the 7th of&nbsp; November to plead to said&nbsp; complaint.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the morning of&nbsp; November 7 a motion&nbsp; was presented by defendants' counsel for&nbsp; an order of the court quashing the complaint&nbsp; and warrant filed&nbsp; and&nbsp; issued in this&nbsp; cause, upon two certain reasons stated therein.&nbsp;&nbsp; An adjournment&nbsp; was then ordered by the court to the morning of the 10th day of the present month, for the purpose&nbsp; of considering said motion and&nbsp; rendering a decision thereon.&nbsp; On&nbsp; the morning of the 10th day of November defendants with&nbsp; their counsel appeared in court, at which&nbsp; time the Government&nbsp; was&nbsp; represented by&nbsp; the prosecuting&nbsp; attorney and his&nbsp; assistant,&nbsp; Mr. South worth, said motion&nbsp; was then&nbsp; and there overruled.&nbsp; Immediately following said decision a motion was presented by defendants' counsel for an order of the court requiring the prosecuting&nbsp; attorney&nbsp; to&nbsp; present&nbsp; and exhibit in this&nbsp; case&nbsp; the preliminary investigation practiced in the office of&nbsp; the prosecuting attorney, in pursuance&nbsp; of the&nbsp; provisions of Act No. 612 of the&nbsp; honorable Philippine Commission, which motion&nbsp; was denied, being&nbsp; founded upon the rule promulgated in&nbsp; the&nbsp; case of the&nbsp; United&nbsp; States&nbsp; against Wilson, reported in the fourth volume of Philippine Reports.&nbsp; Defendants'&nbsp; counsel then requested further time within which to present a&nbsp; demurrer to said complaint, and for nothing more.&nbsp; This&nbsp; application was granted and&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants were ordered to appear in court at this time, to wit, 0 o'clock&nbsp; a.&nbsp; m,,&nbsp; November 12,&nbsp; 1908, for the presentation of said demurrer, as the only further dilatory plea, and then to answer to said complaint.<br><br>"At the last-mentioned&nbsp; time, to wit, 9&nbsp; o'clock a m., November 12, 1908, defendants' counsel now present a motion&nbsp; for an order of the court authorizing and directing that a preliminary investigation be now conducted in this case.<br><br>"Considering the foregoing proceedings in this case, and the orders of the court&nbsp; issued therein,&nbsp; together with the provisions of Act No. 612 of the honorable Philippine Commission, as interpreted by the&nbsp; honorable&nbsp; Supreme Court in said case of the United States <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.

"This&nbsp; defendant, Fidel A. Reyes, is&nbsp; the chief editor of the&nbsp; newspaper 'El Renacimiento,'&nbsp; as the&nbsp; word editor is used in section 3432 of the&nbsp; Compilation of the Acts of the Philippine Commission&nbsp; before referred&nbsp; to, ajid&nbsp; as&nbsp; such editor he is chargeable with the&nbsp; publication of the article set forth in the complaint.<br><br>"I therefore find this&nbsp; defendant, Fidel A.

Reyes.<br><br>"2.&nbsp; That even granting that the article 'Birds of Pray' were&nbsp; libelous per se, the responsibility of the&nbsp; defendant Fidel&nbsp; A. Reyes is not clearly shown.&nbsp; Nevertheless the court finds the said defendant guilty for the sole reason that he is the redactor&nbsp; jefe of the newspaper 'El Renacimiento' on or about the 30th of October, 1908, on which&nbsp; date&nbsp; the article alleged&nbsp; to be libelous&nbsp; was published in&nbsp; the said newspaper.<br><br>"The mere fact that the words redactor jefe were translated&nbsp; as 'editor chief&nbsp; is not sufficiently&nbsp; conclusive&nbsp; to&nbsp; the minds of the undersigned to saddle upon the accused the consequent criminal responsibility in the present action. "The facts proven in the record which&nbsp; have served as grounds for&nbsp; the&nbsp; defense of&nbsp; the&nbsp; accused&nbsp; are&nbsp; clear&nbsp; and evident, and show his exemption from responsibility.&nbsp;&nbsp; These facts are, first,&nbsp; that Fidel A. Reyes is not the director of 'El Renacimiento' but that&nbsp; his fellow-defendant, Teodoro M. Kalaw, is; second,&nbsp; because&nbsp; Fidel A. Reyes could nott if he would, publish the newspaper 'El Renacimiento' without the consent&nbsp; of his&nbsp; director; third, because the accused, as&nbsp; simply&nbsp; redactor&nbsp; jefe&nbsp; does&nbsp; not&nbsp; write&nbsp; the editorials or doctrinal articles of the said newspaper, but only prepares the&nbsp; local&nbsp; news, which he&nbsp; also submits&nbsp; to the director; fourth, because&nbsp; there is no proof in the record that Fidel A.&nbsp; Reyes&nbsp; is&nbsp; the author&nbsp; of&nbsp; the said article; fifth,&nbsp; because the accused is not the editor of 'El Renacimiento,' and sixth, because, finally,&nbsp; neither is the proprietor.<br><br>"These facts are based on the testimony of witnesses also for the defense,&nbsp; tending: to show, as has been satisfactorily shown, that&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; organization of Spanish and Filipino newspapers in&nbsp; the Philippines the person responsible in the eyes of the&nbsp; law for the publication of the newspaper is&nbsp; the director; in the present case the accused was not nor could he be the <i>director </i>of 'El Renacimiento' on the date of record, that official being Sr. Teodoro M.&nbsp; Kalaw. <br><br>"For the&nbsp; considerations shown, the undersigned&nbsp; are of the opinion that the accused Fidel A.&nbsp; Reyes should be absolved of the complaint."<br></blockquote><center>TRIAL OF THE DEFENDANT TEODORO&nbsp; M.

Kalaw, was also present in court.<br><br>After hearing the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause, the Hon. A. S. Crossfield, after making a&nbsp; full finding of facts from&nbsp; the&nbsp; evidence, reached the following conclusions and rendered the following sentence on the 8th day of March,&nbsp; 1909:<br><blockquote>"That the article published in the newspaper 'El Renacimiento' on October 30,&nbsp; 1908, as charged in the complaint, is a&nbsp; malicious defamation, tending to&nbsp; impeach&nbsp; the honesty, virtue, and reputation&nbsp; of Dean C.&nbsp; Worcester,&nbsp; a member of the Philippine Commission&nbsp; and Secretary of the Interior of the Philippine Islands,&nbsp; and&nbsp; is a libel.<br><br>"That the&nbsp; article&nbsp; being&nbsp; published, as appears from&nbsp; the showing made by the defense, upon the facts adduced by it at the trial, the malice&nbsp; of its statements is only accentuated.

SANTOS.<br></center><br>After hearing the&nbsp; evidence adduced during the trial of the cause against the defendant Lope K. Santos, the Hon. A. S.&nbsp; Crossfield, together with the assessors selected, found that the evidence was insufficient to support the complaint, and therefore the cause against&nbsp; the&nbsp; said Lope K. Santos was dismissed and he was discharged from custody.<br><center><br>TRIAL OF THE DEFENDANT FAUSTINO AGUILAR.<br></center><br>After hearing the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause against the defendant Faustino Aguilar, the Hon. A. S. Crossfield, together with the assessors selected, found that the evidence was insufficient to support the complaint, and therefore the cause against the said Faustino Aguilar was dismissed and he was discharged from custody. The&nbsp; defendants,&nbsp; Martin Ocampo, Fidel&nbsp; A. Reyes, and Teodoro M. Kalaw,&nbsp; duly appealed from the sentence of the lower court and each made assignments of&nbsp; error in this court, some of which are as follows:<br><blockquote>"1.&nbsp; The court erred in issuing the warrant&nbsp; of arrest and proceeding with&nbsp; the&nbsp; trial of the defendant without any preliminary investigation&nbsp; of the complaint being made.<br><br>"2. The court erred in&nbsp; holding&nbsp; that Act No. 612 is not unconstitutional.<br><br>"3. The court erred in assuming jurisdiction of the complaint herein filed.<br><br>"4. The court erred in&nbsp; holding that the facts alleged&nbsp; in the complaint constitute the crime of libel.<br><br>"5. The court erred in admitting as evidence on behalf&nbsp; of the prosecution the opinion of witnesses."</blockquote>With&nbsp; reference to these assignments of error, the first three we think may logically be considered together.&nbsp; Under these assignments of error, the appellants contend:<br><br>(<i>a</i>) That they were entitled, as of right, to a preliminary investigation;<br><br>(<i>b</i>) That the court committed&nbsp; an&nbsp; error in&nbsp; issuing the warrant for&nbsp; their arrest and&nbsp; proceeding with&nbsp; the&nbsp; trial without&nbsp; first giving them a preliminary hearing;<br><br>(<i>c</i>) That they&nbsp; were deprived of&nbsp; their liberty&nbsp; without "due&nbsp; process of law;"<br><br>(<i>d</i>) That in&nbsp; the absence of&nbsp; a preliminary examination the court was without jurisdiction to try them; and<br><br>(<i>e</i>) That Act No. 612 of the Philippine Commission&nbsp; is unconstitutional.<br><br>With reference to the necessity of a preliminary examination,&nbsp; under the procedure&nbsp; adopted&nbsp; for the city of Manila, this court&nbsp; has&nbsp; decided in the&nbsp; cases&nbsp; of U.&nbsp; S.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.&nbsp; Wilson (4 Phil.

Wilson, supra, this court said,&nbsp; speaking through Mr.&nbsp; Justice&nbsp; Willard, now&nbsp; United States judge of the district of Minnesota&nbsp; (pp.&nbsp; 321, 322) : "It is&nbsp; claimed, also, that the&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; of&nbsp; conviction is erroneous because no&nbsp; preliminary&nbsp; investigation was held, as required by sections 12 and 13 of General Orders, No. 58.<br><br>This claim is answered by reference to Act No. 612 of the Commission, which in section 2 provides as follows:<br><blockquote>" 'In cases triable only in the Court of First Instance in the city of Manila, the defendant shall have a speedy trial, but shall not be entitled as of right to a preliminary examination in any case where the prosecuting attorney (of the city of Manila) after&nbsp; due investigation of the facts, under section 39 (Act No. 183, the Charter of the city of Manila) of&nbsp; the Act of&nbsp; which&nbsp; this&nbsp; is&nbsp; an&nbsp; amendment, shall have presented an information against him in proper form.' "<br></blockquote>In the case of United&nbsp; States <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. McGovern, supra, this court, speaking through&nbsp; its Chief Justice,&nbsp; Mr.&nbsp; Arellano, said (citing and relying upon said Act No. 612) (p. 623) : <br></div><div align="justify"><br></div><div align="justify"><blockquote>"*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; Investigation made by the judge was not substantially defective, nor was it necessary, and this is&nbsp; the most important, the complaint having been presented to the Court of First Instance of the&nbsp; city of Manila,&nbsp; in which an accused person&nbsp; <i>is not entitled, as&nbsp; a matter of right,&nbsp; to&nbsp; a preliminary&nbsp; investigation</i>, and&nbsp; consequently&nbsp; no&nbsp; law or statute has been violated, and&nbsp; <i>due process of&nbsp; law has&nbsp; not been lacking</i>."<br></blockquote><br>The appellants contend that to arrest a defendant in&nbsp; a criminal cause in: the&nbsp; Philippine&nbsp; Islands and bring him to trial, without first giving him a&nbsp; preliminary&nbsp; examination when he demands it, is to deprive him of his liberty, without&nbsp; <i>due&nbsp; process of&nbsp; law</i>.&nbsp; This contention is&nbsp; based&nbsp; upon certain paragraphs of section 5 of the Act of&nbsp; Congress of July 1, 1902, known as the Philippine Bill, which, among other things, provide as follows:<br><blockquote>"No person shall be held to answer for a&nbsp; criminal offense, without due process of law.&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *<br><center><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * <br></center><br>"And no warrant shall issue but&nbsp; upon probable&nbsp; cause, supported by oath or affirmation,&nbsp;&nbsp; * *&nbsp;&nbsp; *"</blockquote>It will be&nbsp; noted that there&nbsp; is&nbsp; nothing&nbsp; in the&nbsp; said bill (Philippine Bill) which defines or attempts to define what is meant by the phrase "due process of law."&nbsp; <i>The Philippine Bill does not expressly require a preliminary examination</i> and, therefore, unless&nbsp; a preliminary examination&nbsp; is a necessary step in "due process of law" or for the "issuance of&nbsp; a warrant of arrest,"&nbsp; said&nbsp; Act No.&nbsp; 612 can&nbsp; not be regarded as unconstitutional,&nbsp; regarding the Philippine Bill as the <i>constitution </i>protecting&nbsp; the life, liberty, and property of the people of the Philippine&nbsp; Islands.&nbsp;&nbsp; It will be noted, also, that the Philippine&nbsp; Bill&nbsp; was enacted by&nbsp; Congress on the&nbsp; 1st of July,&nbsp; 1902, and that Act No. 612 was enacted by the&nbsp; Philippine Commission on the&nbsp; 3d&nbsp; of February, 1903. The legislative department of the Government, therefore, must have had in mind, when it denied to defendants the right of a preliminary examination in&nbsp; the city of Manila, the provisions of the Philippine Bill.<br><br>By reference to the proceedings in the court below&nbsp; preceding&nbsp; the&nbsp; arrest of the defendant (all&nbsp; of&nbsp; which&nbsp; is&nbsp; set out above)Â»&nbsp; it will be seen that the&nbsp; procedure adopted&nbsp; by&nbsp; Act No.&nbsp; 183 (Charter of the city of Manila), as&nbsp; amended by said Act No.&nbsp; 612, was followed; therefore the question&nbsp; is presented: Does&nbsp; such procedure&nbsp; constitute due process of law?&nbsp; This&nbsp; phrase has been discussed a great many times by the Supreme Court of the United States, by the supreme courts of the different States, and by all of the writers upon questions of constitutional law.&nbsp; The&nbsp; requirement&nbsp; above quoted from the&nbsp; Philippine Bill&nbsp; relating to due process of law&nbsp; is found&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; constitution of practically all&nbsp; of&nbsp; the States of the&nbsp; Union.&nbsp; It is sometimes couched in the&nbsp; language that&nbsp; persons "shall&nbsp; not be&nbsp; deprived of their life, liberty, or property"&nbsp; except by "the law of the land."&nbsp; In others, the phrase is "due process of law."&nbsp;&nbsp; These different phrases, however,&nbsp; have been&nbsp; given&nbsp; practically&nbsp; the same definition by the&nbsp; different courts&nbsp; which have attempted an explanation&nbsp; of their meaning.&nbsp;&nbsp; The phrase "due process of law" has been variously defined.&nbsp; Judge Story, in his work on Constitutional Law, defines it&nbsp; as "The law in its regular course of administration, through the courts of justice."<br><br>Judge Cooley, in his&nbsp; work on Constitutional Limitations, says&nbsp; (p. 434) :<br><blockquote>"Due process of law&nbsp; in each particular case means such an exercise of the powers of the government&nbsp; as the settled maxims of&nbsp; law&nbsp; permit&nbsp; and sanction, and under such safeguards for the protection of individual&nbsp; rights&nbsp; as those maxims prescribe for the&nbsp; class of cases to which the&nbsp; one in question&nbsp; belongs"<br><br></blockquote>But even though&nbsp; it be&nbsp; contended that a preliminary examination is a&nbsp; necessary step in "due process of law," then&nbsp; we reply that a preliminary examination was held in the present case by the prosecuting attorney&nbsp; of the city of Manila, as&nbsp; will appear from his sworn&nbsp; statement.&nbsp; Certainly it will not be contended that he is not as competent to conduct a preliminary&nbsp; examination&nbsp; as&nbsp; the average person designated&nbsp; by the&nbsp; law&nbsp; for that&nbsp; purpose.&nbsp; He is a sworn officer of the court and the law makes it his&nbsp; duty to make these investigations.&nbsp; The legislature may designate whomsoever it pleases, within the judicial department, for that purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp; The prosecuting&nbsp; attorney&nbsp; is a sworn&nbsp; official of the&nbsp; Government and is&nbsp; just&nbsp; as likely to be free from prejudice&nbsp; as any other&nbsp; official&nbsp; who&nbsp; might be&nbsp; appointed or designated.<br><br>It may be argued also that Act No. 612 is&nbsp; a special&nbsp; law applicable to the city of Manila alone and is for that reason unconstitutional.&nbsp;&nbsp; In reply to&nbsp; that&nbsp; argument it may&nbsp; be said:<br><br>(<i>a</i>) That there is no requirement that all the&nbsp; laws in the Philippine Islands shall be alike&nbsp; applicable throughout the Islands;<br><br>(<i>b</i>) That the city of Manila&nbsp; is governed&nbsp; by a&nbsp; special charter and has such powers as are expressly or impliedly given to&nbsp; it&nbsp; without reference to the powers&nbsp; given&nbsp; to&nbsp; the other municipalities;<br><br>(<i>c</i>)&nbsp; That it has&nbsp; special&nbsp; courts with&nbsp; special jurisdiction which other municipalities do not have;<br><br>(<i>d</i>) It has its own method of levying and collecting taxes, which is different from&nbsp; the method of other municipalities;<br><br>(<i>e</i>)&nbsp; It has its own officials with special functions, some of which other municipalities do not have;<br><br>(<i>f</i>)&nbsp; It has many&nbsp; special powers, such as to make and enter into certain&nbsp; classes of special contracts, which other municipalities do not have.<br><br>It would be just as logical&nbsp; to hold that all of the other special provisions&nbsp; for the city of&nbsp; Manila are unconstitutional, as to&nbsp; hold&nbsp; that the&nbsp; one in&nbsp; question is contrary to the Philippine Bill, simply because they are not applicable throughout the Philippine&nbsp; Islands.&nbsp; To&nbsp; hold&nbsp; thus would mean that the legislature&nbsp; could&nbsp; hot grant to particular municipalities any special rights or impose upon them any special obligations which&nbsp; were not&nbsp; applicable&nbsp; to all&nbsp; the municipalities.<br><blockquote>"Due process of law" is not ironclad in its meaning.&nbsp; It does not necessarily mean a particular procedure.&nbsp; The National Government may adopt one procedure satisfying the requirement and the State government may adopt still another,&nbsp; and not only that, but each State may adopt an entirely different procedure from that adopted either by the National Government or by any&nbsp; of the sister States, <i>provided always that the procedure&nbsp; adopted in each jurisdiction fully furnishes protection to life, liberty, and property</i>.

S., 138)a Mr. Justice Day, speaking for the court, said (pp. 147, 148) : "The Spanish system&nbsp; in force&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Philippines gave right to the accused to be tried before judges, who acted in effect&nbsp; as&nbsp; a court of inquiry and whose judgments were not final&nbsp; until passed in review before the audiencia,&nbsp; or superior court,&nbsp; with right&nbsp; of final review and power&nbsp; to grant a new trial for errors of law in the supreme court at Madrid.&nbsp;&nbsp; To&nbsp; this system the Philippine&nbsp; Commission,&nbsp; in executing the power conferred by the orders of the President and&nbsp; sanctioned by Act&nbsp; of Congress&nbsp; (Act of July 1, 1902, 32 Stat. at L., 691, chap.1369), has added (1) a guaranty of the right of&nbsp; the accused to be heard by himself and counsel; (2) to demand the nature and cause of the accusation against him; (3) to have a speedy and public trial; (4) to meet the witnesses against him face to face; (5)&nbsp; and to have&nbsp; compulsory process to compel the attendance of witnesses in his behalf; and (6) that no person shall be&nbsp; held to answer for a criminal offense without due process of law, nor be put twice in jeopardy of punishment for the same offense, nor compelled in any criminal case&nbsp; to be a witness against himself.&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; <i> It can not be successfully maintained that this&nbsp; system does not give an&nbsp; adequate&nbsp; and efficient method of protecting the rights of&nbsp; the accused, as well&nbsp; as executing the criminal law&nbsp; by judicial proceedings, which give full&nbsp; opportunity to be heard by&nbsp; competent tribunals before judgment can be pronounced."</i></blockquote>The requirement that no&nbsp; person shall&nbsp; be held to answer for a criminal offense without "due process of law" <i> simply requires&nbsp; that the procedure&nbsp; established&nbsp; by law&nbsp; shall&nbsp; be followed.&nbsp;&nbsp; If that procedure fully protects the life, liberty, and property&nbsp; of&nbsp; the citizens in the State, then it will&nbsp; be held to be "due process of law."</i><br><br>The procedure provided for the arrest and&nbsp; trial&nbsp; of defendants in the&nbsp; city of Manila fully guarantees&nbsp; all&nbsp; oi the rights mentioned in the Philippine&nbsp; Bill.&nbsp; Such procedure is not,&nbsp; therefore, in conflict with the&nbsp; provisions&nbsp; of the Philippine Bill and is constitutional.<br><br>The provision that no warrant&nbsp; shall issue&nbsp; but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation is&nbsp; a provision in the Philippine Bill.&nbsp;&nbsp; The question whether&nbsp; "probable cause" exists or not must depend upon the judgment and discretion&nbsp; of the judge or&nbsp; magistrate&nbsp; issuing&nbsp; the warrant.&nbsp;&nbsp; It does not mean that particular facts must exist in&nbsp; each particular case.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; simply means&nbsp; that&nbsp; sufficient facts must be presented to the judge or magistrate issuing the warrant to convince him, not that the particular person has committed the crime, <i>but that there is probable cause for&nbsp; believing that the person whose arrest is sought committed the crime charged.</i>&nbsp; No rule can be laid down&nbsp; which will govern the discretion of&nbsp; the court in this matter.&nbsp;&nbsp; If he&nbsp; decides,&nbsp; upon the proof presented, that probable cause exists, no objection can be made upon constitutional grounds against the issuance of the warrant.&nbsp; His conclusion as to whether "probable cause" existed or not is&nbsp; final&nbsp; and conclusive.&nbsp; If he is satisfied that "probable cause" exists from the facts stated in the complaint, made upon the investigation by the prosecuting&nbsp; attorney, then&nbsp; his conclusion is sufficient upon&nbsp; which to issue the warrant for arrest.&nbsp; He may, however,&nbsp; if he is&nbsp; not satisfied, call such witnesses as he&nbsp; may deem necessary before issuing the warrant. <i> The issuance of the warrant of arrest is prima&nbsp; facie&nbsp; evidence that, in his judgment at least,&nbsp; there&nbsp; existed "probable cause" for&nbsp; believing that the person&nbsp; against&nbsp; whom&nbsp; the warrant is issued is guilty of the crime charged. </i>&nbsp; There is no law which prohibits him from reaching the&nbsp; conclusion that "probable&nbsp; cause"&nbsp; exists from the statement of&nbsp; the prosecuting attorney alone,&nbsp; or any other&nbsp; person&nbsp; whose statement or affidavit is entitled to credit in the opinion of the judge or magistrate.<br><br>The appellants contend that, under the fourth assignment of error, the court committed an error in holding that&nbsp; the facts alleged in the complaint constitute&nbsp; the crime of libel. The particular&nbsp; parts of the said editorial charged in&nbsp; the information as libelous&nbsp; are as follows:<br><blockquote>"Ascending the mountains&nbsp; of Beng;uet to classify and measure the skulls of the Igorot and study and civilize them, and to espy in his flight, with the eye of the bird of prey, where&nbsp; are the&nbsp; large deposits&nbsp; of gold, the prey concealed amidst the lonely mountains, to appropriate them to himself afterwards, thanks to legal&nbsp; facilities&nbsp; made and&nbsp; unmade at will, but always for his own benefit.<br><br>"Authorizing,&nbsp; despite&nbsp; laws and&nbsp; ordinances, an illegal slaughtering of diseased cattle in order to derive benefit from the infected and putrid meat which he himself was obliged to condemn by virtue of his official position.<br><br>"Presenting&nbsp; himself on all&nbsp; occasions with (he wrinkled brow of the scientist who consumes his life in the mysteries of the laboratory of science, when his whole&nbsp; scientific labor is confined to dissecting&nbsp; insects and importing fish&nbsp; eggs, as if the fish of this&nbsp; country were&nbsp; less&nbsp; nourishing&nbsp; and less savory, so as&nbsp; to&nbsp; make it worth the while replacing them with species coming from other climes.<br><br>"Giving admirable impulse&nbsp; to the discovery of&nbsp; wealthy lodes in Mindoro, in Mindanao, and in other virgin regions of the Archipelago, with&nbsp; the money of the people and under the pretext of the public good, when, as a strict matter of truth, the object is to possess all the data and the key to the national wealth for his&nbsp; essentially personal benefit, as is shown by the&nbsp; acquisition of immense properties registered under the names of others.<br><br>"Promoting through secret&nbsp; agents and partners&nbsp; the sale to the city of&nbsp; worthless&nbsp; land at fabulous&nbsp; prices, which the city fathers dare not refuse, from fear&nbsp; of displeasing the one who is behind the motion,&nbsp; and which they do not refuse for their own good.<br><br>"Patronizing concessions for hotels on filled-in land, with the prospects&nbsp; of&nbsp; enormous profits, at the expense of the blood of the people."</blockquote>The information alleges that the publication related to Mr. Dean C. Worcester,&nbsp; and that the&nbsp; defendants intended and did charge the said Dean&nbsp; C. Worcester with prostituting his office as a member of the Philippine Commission and as Secretary of the Interior of the&nbsp; Philippine Islands for private ends; with squandering the public funds for the purpose of promoting his personal welfare;&nbsp; with violating the laws of the Philippine Islands and&nbsp; the&nbsp; ordinances of the city of Manila; with entering&nbsp; into-illegal combinations for the purpose of robbing the people, with the intent of gain. to himself and other individuals; and that the said defamation would be and was so understood by the inhabitants of the&nbsp; city of Manila, the officials of the&nbsp; Government, and the&nbsp; people of the Philippine Islands&nbsp; generally, to&nbsp; accuse the&nbsp; said Dean C. Worcester of the conduct and acts and things set out in the said complaint, and to state and publish, by&nbsp; innuendo&nbsp; and inference,&nbsp; that&nbsp; he, the&nbsp; said&nbsp; Dean&nbsp; C. Worcester, was guilty of the said acts, deeds,&nbsp; and doings; all of which allegations regarding the conduct and character of the said Dean C.&nbsp; Worcester, as above set&nbsp; forth, were charged to be false and without foundation in fact.<br><br>In our opinion these charges, if false, are clearly libelous; therefore the lower court committed no error in overruling said demurrer.&nbsp;&nbsp; We&nbsp; think&nbsp; that&nbsp; the information contains sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action for libel.<br><br>The theory of the&nbsp; defense&nbsp; is that the alleged libelous editorial does not apply to the&nbsp; said&nbsp; Dean&nbsp; C.&nbsp; Worcester. That is a&nbsp; question of proof.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is charged that they do. If they do, then they tend to impeach the honesty, virtue, and reputation of Mr. Worcester and to expose him to public hatred, contempt, and ridicule and are, therefore, libelous;<br><br>Under the fifth assignment of error above&nbsp; noted, the defendants and appellants contend that the court committed an error in permitting witnesses to give their opinion upon the question whether or not the words in&nbsp; the said editorial apply to Mr. Dean C. Worcester.&nbsp; The Solicitor-General,&nbsp; in his&nbsp; very able brief presented to this court,&nbsp; cites many authorities in support&nbsp; of the&nbsp; ruling&nbsp; of&nbsp; the lower&nbsp; court. Among these&nbsp; authorities are:&nbsp; 18 American and English Encyclopedia of Law, at page 996, Note 2; Russell <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Kelly (44 Cal., 641, 642) ; Enquirer&nbsp; Company <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.&nbsp; Johnston&nbsp; (72 Fed. Rep., 443) ; State&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Mason&nbsp; (35&nbsp; Pac. Rep.,&nbsp; 130) ; People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Ritchie (42 Pac. Rep., 209).<br><br>In the present case a number of witnesses, among whom were the Hon. James F. Smith, then Govarnor-General&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Philippine&nbsp; Islands; the Hon. Gregorio Araneta,&nbsp; then and now Secretary of Finance and Justice of the Philippine Islands; Hon. Newton&nbsp; W.&nbsp; Gilbert, Secretary of&nbsp; Public Instruction, were called for the purpose of showing that the statements made in said editorial were intended to apply to the&nbsp; Hon. Dean C. Worcester,&nbsp; Secretary&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Interior. Each of the witnesses testified that he was acquainted with Mr. Worcester, that&nbsp; he had&nbsp; read the said editorial, and that, in his opinion,&nbsp; the&nbsp; statements made&nbsp; therein were intended to and did apply to the Hon. Dean&nbsp; C. Worcester and to&nbsp; no&nbsp; other&nbsp; person or persons.&nbsp; The&nbsp; defendants duly objected to these questions and excepted to&nbsp; the ruling of the court admitting them.<br><br>In the case of Russell <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Kelly, supra,&nbsp; the action was for&nbsp; libel founded&nbsp; upon&nbsp; certain&nbsp; publications&nbsp; made&nbsp; by&nbsp; the defendant, in which&nbsp; the&nbsp; name&nbsp; of the plaintiff&nbsp; was&nbsp; not mentioned.&nbsp; At the&nbsp; trial, witnesses&nbsp; were&nbsp; called&nbsp; by&nbsp; the plaintiff to testify that they were acquainted with the parties and familiar with the relations which existed between them immediately prior to the date of the&nbsp; publication; that on reading the publication they&nbsp; understood the plaintiff to be one&nbsp; of the persons referred to.&nbsp;&nbsp; The plaintiff also offered in evidence a subsequent publication made by the defendant (in&nbsp; which&nbsp; the plaintiff was referred to by name) for&nbsp; the purpose of identifying him as one of the persons to whom the&nbsp; preceding&nbsp; publication referred.&nbsp;&nbsp; Objection was duly made to this proof and&nbsp; overruled by the lower court.&nbsp; The Supreme Court, in deciding the question&nbsp; presented, said (pp. 644, 645) <br><blockquote>"The rule as laid down in&nbsp; 2 Starkie&nbsp; on&nbsp; Slander (p. 51) is that the application&nbsp; of the&nbsp; slanderous&nbsp; words to the plaintiff, and the extrinsic matters alleged&nbsp; in the declaration, may be shown 'by the testimony of the witnesses who knew the parties and circumstances, and who can state their judgment&nbsp; and opinion on the application and meaning of the terms used by the defendant.'&nbsp; At page 321 it is said that where it is ambiguous on the face of the libel to whom it was intended to be applied, 'the judgment and opinion of witnesses, who from&nbsp; their knowledge of the parties&nbsp; and circumstances are able to form a conclusion as to the defendant's intention and application of the libel, is evidence for the information of the jury.'&nbsp;&nbsp; The same rule is stated in almost the same language in 2 Greenl. on Evidence,&nbsp; section 417.&nbsp;&nbsp; The correctness of this rule is not only established by the weight of authority, but is supported by&nbsp; every consideration of&nbsp; justice and&nbsp; sound policy.&nbsp; I am, therefore, of opinion that there was no error in admitting oral testimony to show the application of the alleged libel to the plaintiff." In the case&nbsp; of the Enquirer Company <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Johnston, <i>supra</i>, the witness was asked a question almost identically similar to the question asked in the present case, to wit:<br><br>"Q.&nbsp; You may&nbsp; state, Mr.&nbsp; Barnett [the&nbsp; witness],&nbsp; after reading the article [meaning the publication in question], to whom did you understand it to refer when it spoke of Mr. Johnston's intimacy with&nbsp; the wife of a deceased brother? "The witness [Mr. Barnett]&nbsp; answered as follows:<br><br>''A.&nbsp; I understood it to mean Mr. Johnston and the widow that had come from Australia, that he had sent for."</blockquote>To this question and answer&nbsp; the defendants objected and the court, in passing upon the objection,&nbsp; said:<br><blockquote>"In Odgers&nbsp; on Libel and Slander (p. 567), it is said, 'The plaintiff&nbsp; may&nbsp; also call&nbsp; at the&nbsp; trial&nbsp; his friends,&nbsp; or others acquainted with the circumstances, to state that, on reading the libel, they at once concluded that it&nbsp; was aimed at&nbsp; the plaintiff.&nbsp; It is not necessary that all the world should understand the libel; it is sufficient if those who know the plaintiff can make out that&nbsp; he is the person meant.'&nbsp; To the&nbsp; same effect is the text in Falkard's Starkie on Libel and Slander. (4th Eng. ed., p. 589.)<br><center><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * <br></center><br>'"<i>One's reputation is the sum or composite of the impressions spontaneously made&nbsp; by him from,time to time, and in one way or another, upon his neighbors and acquaintances</i>. The effect of a libelous publication upon the understanding of such persons, involving necessarily the identity of the individual libeled, is of the essence of the wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp; The issue in a libel case concerns not only the sense of the publication, but, in a measure, its effect upon a reader acquainted with the person referred to.&nbsp;&nbsp; The accuracy of the witness as to identity may be tested by cross-examination.&nbsp; At all events, and in view&nbsp; of the answer by Mr.&nbsp; Barnett, which&nbsp; appears to be the only matter in the record suggesting the possibility that there&nbsp; might&nbsp; have been&nbsp; some&nbsp; 'wife&nbsp; of&nbsp; a&nbsp; deceased brother'&nbsp; other than this defendant in error to whom&nbsp; the publication in fact referred, this court can not hold the error in question well assigned."</blockquote>While the&nbsp; action of the Enquirer Company <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Johnston, <i>supra</i>, was&nbsp; a civil action&nbsp; for damages,&nbsp; yet&nbsp; the rule in a criminal action is the same.&nbsp; (25 Cyc, 582.)<br><br>In the case of the People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.&nbsp; Ritchie, <i>supra</i>, the court, in deciding the&nbsp; same question presented here, said:<br><blockquote>"We think the weight of&nbsp; authority supports the view that when the person sought to be libeled is designated&nbsp; in an ambiguous manner, testimony may&nbsp; be given&nbsp; that&nbsp; the publication was understood to&nbsp; mean&nbsp; the&nbsp; person alleged to be&nbsp; libeled.&nbsp;&nbsp; (2 Greenl.&nbsp; Ev., 417;&nbsp; Nelson <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.

McGurrin was the person referred to in the article.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Farrand <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.&nbsp; Aldrich, supra; 13&nbsp; Am. &amp; Eng. Enc.&nbsp; Law, 486; 3 Lawson, Rights Rem.&nbsp; &amp; Prac, 1244.)"<br></blockquote>Our&nbsp; conclusion is, therefore, with reference to&nbsp; this&nbsp; assignment of error, that in a criminal action for libel, where the publication is ambiguous as to the person to whom it applies, the testimony of persons who read the publication is&nbsp; admissible for the purpose of&nbsp; showing who is intended to&nbsp; be designated by the words in said publication, and that the court committed no error in admitting the testimony of the various witnesses for that purpose.<br><center><br>SPECIAL DEFENSES OF THE&nbsp; APPELLANT MARTIN OCAMPO.<br></center><br>In&nbsp; addition to the foregoing assignments of error made by each of&nbsp; the appellants the&nbsp; appellant Martin&nbsp; Ocampo, made the following:<br><blockquote>"1. The court erred in declaring that the crime of libel was proved at the trial.<br><br>"2. The court erred in holding that the accused&nbsp; is one of the owners of 'El Renacimiento.'<br><br>"3. The court erred in holding that Martin Ocampo published and caused to&nbsp; be&nbsp; published the&nbsp; article in question, using 'El Renacimiento' therefor, and the circulation thereof throughout the Philippine Islands.<br><br>"4, The court erred in convicting the accused."<br></blockquote>With reference to the first above assignment of error, the appellant Martin Ocampo contends that the evidence&nbsp; fails to show that the crime of libel had been committed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon this contention&nbsp; of the defendant, from an examination of the evidence adduced during the&nbsp; trial, we are of the opinion that the proof shows that the editorial in question did refer to the Hon. Dean C. Worcester, and from an examination of the said editorial we find that he is charged with ascending the mountains of&nbsp; Beguet&nbsp; to&nbsp; espy in his flight,&nbsp; with the eye of the bird of prey,&nbsp; where are the large deposits of gold,&nbsp; the&nbsp; prey concealed&nbsp; amidst the lonely mountains, to appropriate them to himself, thanks to&nbsp; legal facilities made and unmade at will, but always&nbsp; for his own benefit;" with "authorizing&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; an&nbsp; illegal&nbsp; slaughter of&nbsp; diseased cattle in order to derive benefit from the infected and putrid meat&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *;" with "giving an admirable impulse to the discovery of wealthy lodes&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; with the money of the people, and under the&nbsp; pretext of the public good, when, as a matter of truth, the object is to possess all the data and the key to the national wealth for his essentially&nbsp; personal wealth, as is shown by the acquisition of immense properties registered under the names of&nbsp; others;" with&nbsp; "promoting, through secret agents&nbsp; and partners, the sale to the city&nbsp; of&nbsp; worthless land at fabulous prices;"&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; * with "patronizing-concessions for hotels&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; at the expense of the blood of the people."<br><br>These charges, in our opinion, if not proved to be true, constitute&nbsp; a malicious defamation, expressed in writing, tending* to impeach the honesty and reputation of Dean C. Worcester and expose him to public hatred, contempt, and ridicule, and are, therefore, libelous.&nbsp; It was proven that the said alleged libel was&nbsp; published and circulated throughout the Philippine Islands and will be&nbsp; presumed&nbsp; to have been published with&nbsp; malice, no justifiable&nbsp; motive&nbsp; having been proven for making it.&nbsp; In&nbsp; our opinion&nbsp; the lower court committed no error in declaring that the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause clearly demonstrated that the crime of libel&nbsp; had been committed.<br><br>With reference to the second assignment&nbsp; of error, to wit: that the court erred in holding that the accused is one of the owners of "El&nbsp; Renacimiento,"&nbsp; an examination of&nbsp; the proof&nbsp; shows,&nbsp; beyond question,&nbsp; that Ocampo&nbsp; was the&nbsp; administrator, manager, and&nbsp; one of&nbsp; the proprietors of&nbsp; the newspaper known as "El Renacimiento," published at No. 26 Calle Gunao,&nbsp; in the city of Manila, on the&nbsp; 30th day of October, 1908, and had been such administrator,&nbsp; manager, and&nbsp; part proprietor of the said newspaper for some time theretofore. The lower court, therefore, committed no error in declaring that the&nbsp; said Martin Ocampo was one of&nbsp; the owners of "El Renacimiento."<br><br>With reference to the third&nbsp; above assignment of error, to wit: that the court erred in holding that Martin Ocampo published and&nbsp; caused to be published the article in question, using&nbsp; "El Renacimiento" therefor&nbsp; and&nbsp; the circulation thereof throughout the Philippine&nbsp; Islands, from&nbsp; the&nbsp; evidence adduced during the trial it clearly appears, and there is no proof to the contrary,&nbsp; that Ocampo&nbsp; was one of the owners of "El Renacimiento" and was its administrator.<br><br>Section 6 of Act No. 277 provides thatâ€”<br><blockquote>"Every author, editor or proprietor of any book, newspaper, or serial publication is chargeable with the publication of any words contained in&nbsp; any part of such book or number of each newspaper or serial, as fully as if he were the author of the same."<br></blockquote>It will be noted that this article provides thatâ€”<br><blockquote>"Every&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; proprietor of any newspaper&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; * is chargeable with the publication of any words contained in&nbsp; any part&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; each&nbsp; newspaper&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; as fully as if he were the author of the same."<br></blockquote>This article has&nbsp; been interpreted in the case of the United States <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Ortiz&nbsp; (8 Phil. Rep., 753).&nbsp; In that case this court, speaking through Mr.&nbsp; Justice Torres, said (pp. 757, 758) :<br><blockquote>"With regard to Jose Gonzalez Paramos, his culpability arises from the proven fact that he was at the time the proprietor of the printing plant&nbsp; which printed the Revista Catolica, and therefore responsible for publishing the libel. He was at the&nbsp; same&nbsp; time the&nbsp; printer and editor of&nbsp; the Revista by virtue&nbsp; of a contract for a certain consideration made by and between&nbsp; him and the <i>Centro Catolico</i>, and is, therefore, likewise liable for the crime as charged.<br><br>"By means of his printing plant,&nbsp; and&nbsp; with his express consent, among others&nbsp; the issue No. 27 of the Revista, dated February 6,1904, containing the libelous matter complained of, was printed and published. By so doing he has rendered himself guilty, together with the&nbsp; director&nbsp; of the Revista, of the crime as defined in section 2&nbsp; of Act No.&nbsp; 277.<br><br>"According to the legal doctrines&nbsp; and&nbsp; jurisprudence of the United States, the printer of a&nbsp; publication&nbsp; contaming libelous matter is liable for the same by reason of his&nbsp; direct connection therewith&nbsp; and&nbsp; his cognizance of the contents thereof. With regard to a publication in which a libel is printed, not only is the publisher but also all other persons who in&nbsp; any way&nbsp; participate in or have any connection with its publication are&nbsp; liable as publishers."</blockquote>This&nbsp; decision&nbsp; would seem to be conclusive against&nbsp; the contention&nbsp; of the appellant.&nbsp; However, an&nbsp; examination of the jurisprudence&nbsp; of other jurisdictions shows clearly that the same doctrine has been established elsewhere. In the case of State <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.&nbsp; Mason (26 L. R. A., 779; 26 Oreg., 273; 46 Am. St. Rep., 629), the question&nbsp; of the responsibility of the manager or proprietor of a newspaper was discussed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The court said, among other things (pp. 782, 783):<br><blockquote>"The question then recurs as to whether the manager or proprietor of a newspaper can escape criminal responsibility solely on the ground that the libelous article was published without his knowledge&nbsp; or consent.&nbsp;&nbsp; When a libel is published in a newspaper, such fact alone is sufficient evidence prima facie to charge the manager or proprietor with the guilt of its publication.&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br><br>"The manager&nbsp; and proprietor of&nbsp; a newspaper, we think ought to be held prima facie liable criminally for whatever appears in his paper; and it should be no defense that the publication was made&nbsp; without his&nbsp; knowledge or consent, *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br><br>"One who furnishes the means for carrying on the publication of a newspaper and entrusts its management to servants or employees whom he selects and controls may be said to cause to&nbsp; be published what actually appears, and should be held responsible therefor, whether he was individually concerned in the publication&nbsp; or not,&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; * Criminal responsibility for the acts of an&nbsp; agent or servant in the course of&nbsp; his employment necessarily implies some degree of guilt or delinquency on the part&nbsp; of the publisher; * * *<br><br>"We think,&nbsp; therefore, the mere&nbsp; fact&nbsp; that the&nbsp; libelous article was published in the newspaper without the knowledge or consent of its proprietor or manager is no defense to&nbsp; a criminal prosecution&nbsp; against such&nbsp; proprietor&nbsp; or manager."</blockquote>In the case of Commonwealth <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Morgan (107 Mass., 197), this same question was&nbsp; considered and the court held that in the criminal prosecution of&nbsp; a publisher of a newspaper in which a libel appears, he is prima facie presumed to have published the libel, and that the exclusion of an offer by the defendant to prove that he never saw the libel and was not aware of its publication until it&nbsp; was pointed out to him and that an apology and retraction were afterwards&nbsp; published in the same paper, gave him no ground for exception. In this same case, Mr. Justice Colt, speaking for the court, said:<br><blockquote>"It is the duty of the proprietor of a public paper, which may be used for the publication of improper communications, to use reasonable caution in the conduct of his business that no libels be&nbsp; published."&nbsp; (Wharton's&nbsp; Criminal Law, sees. 1627, 1649; 1 Bishop's&nbsp; Criminal&nbsp; Law, sees. 219,&nbsp; 221; People&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.&nbsp; Wilson, 64 111., 195; Commonwealth <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Damon, 136 Mass., 441.)<br></blockquote>The above doctrine is&nbsp; also the doctrine established by the English courts.&nbsp; In the case of Rex <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Walter (3 Esp., 21)&nbsp; Lord Kenyon said that he was "clearly of the opinion that the proprietor of a newspaper was answerable criminally as well as civilly for the acts of his servants or agents for misconduct in the management of the paper."<br><br>This&nbsp; was&nbsp; also the&nbsp; opinion of&nbsp; Lord Hale, Mr.&nbsp; Justice Powell, and Mr. Justice Foster.<br><br>Lofft, an&nbsp; English author, in his work on&nbsp; Libel&nbsp; and Slander, said:<br><blockquote>"An information for libel will lie against the publisher of a paper, although he did not know of its being put into the paper and stopped the sale as soon as he discovered it."<br></blockquote>In the case of People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Clay (86 111., 147) the court held thatâ€”<br><blockquote>"A person who makes a&nbsp; defamatory&nbsp; statement to&nbsp; the agent of a newspaper for publication,&nbsp; is liable both&nbsp; civilly and criminally, <i>and his liability is shared by the agent and all others who aid in publishing it</i>."<br></blockquote>We are of the opinion that not only is the decision of the lower court,&nbsp; upon the question&nbsp; to&nbsp; which this assignment of error relates, sustained by sound jurisprudence, but by the express&nbsp; provisions of said&nbsp; article 6&nbsp; (Act&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 277). Said article&nbsp; 6 provides that "Every author&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; is chargeable with the publication."&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; "Every editor is&nbsp; chargeable with the publication," etc.&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; "Every proprietor of any&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; newspaper&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; is chargeable with the publication&nbsp; of any words contained in any *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; number of each newspaper&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; as&nbsp; if he were the author of the same."<br><br>Our conclusion is,&nbsp; in relation to this assignment of error, that the lower&nbsp; court committed no&nbsp; error&nbsp; in&nbsp; holding&nbsp; the defendant liable.<br><center><br>SPECIAL DEFENSES OP THE APPELLANT TEODORO M. KALAW.<br></center><br>The defendant and appellant Teodoro&nbsp; M. Kalaw,&nbsp; made the following assignments of error:<br><blockquote>"1.

The&nbsp; lower&nbsp; court&nbsp; erred&nbsp; in&nbsp; allowing&nbsp; incompetent witnesses to give an opinion upon&nbsp; the article supposed to be libelous.<br><br>"3. The lower court erred in according greater weight to the opinion of the plaintiffs' witnesses than to the authorities and best expert proofs of the defense.<br><br>"4.&nbsp; The court erred in considering that the article complained of alludes exclusively and directly to Mr. Worcester.<br><br>"5.&nbsp; The court erred in considering that the&nbsp; numbers of 'El Renacimiento,' Exhibits B&nbsp; and C of the plaintiffs,&nbsp; indicate&nbsp; that the editorial&nbsp; supposed to be libelous refers to Dean C. Worcester.<br><br>"6.&nbsp; The court erred in holding that the&nbsp; crime of libel charged was proved.<br><br>"7.&nbsp; The court erred in considering that justifiable motives for publishing the article that is considered libelous&nbsp; were not proven.<br><br>"8.&nbsp; The court erred, finally, in convicting" the defendant Teodoro M. Kalaw."</blockquote>The above assignments,&nbsp; Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,&nbsp; and 6,&nbsp; have been sufficiently answered in tfre discussion of the&nbsp; preceding assignments of error.&nbsp; We deem&nbsp; it unnecessary, therefore, to repeat the argument here.<br><br>Under the seventh assignment of&nbsp; error the&nbsp; appellant Teodoro M. Kalaw contends that the lower court committed an error in holding that the records do not show justifiable motives in publishing the alleged libelous article.&nbsp; Upon this question the&nbsp; Hon. A. S. Crossfield, in&nbsp; rendering&nbsp; his sentence in the court below, said:<br><blockquote>"There&nbsp; was an attempt to&nbsp; justify the article&nbsp; (the editorial)&nbsp; on the ground that wrongs had been&nbsp; committed by some one in authority which should be righted and that the article was intended to call attention to the wrongs to have them righted, but the attempt failed utterly.&nbsp; <i>No wrong or evilf as stated in the article, was found to exist.</i><br><br>"In&nbsp; the attempt&nbsp; to justify, the defendant attempted to show that the&nbsp; article was" prepared&nbsp; and&nbsp; published upon information received after investigation made, and because the subject matter&nbsp; of some portions of it had appeared in other newspapers,&nbsp; which were taken to be&nbsp; true, but the evidence in this behalf did not establish the truth of any libelous statement in the article,&nbsp; or&nbsp; that&nbsp; the article was justified upon information at hand when it was published, as appears from the evidence."</blockquote>An examination of the evidence brought to this&nbsp; court in our opinion fully justifies&nbsp; the conclusion of the lower court upon the question of justifiable motives.<br><br>The Attorney-General in his brief said:<br><blockquote>"The testimony of witnesses such as those who&nbsp; testified to Mr. Worcester's ownership of land in&nbsp; Mindoro, Nueva Ecija, and Benguet is so unreliable and so rebutted by such eminently trustworthy witnesses&nbsp; for the Government that the evidence to this end results in nullity.&nbsp; The same conclusion applies to all the appellant's attempts to show justifiable motives."<br></blockquote>The burden of showing justifiable motives rests upon the persons responsible for the publication of&nbsp; a&nbsp; libel.&nbsp;&nbsp; (U. S. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Prautch, 10 Phil.&nbsp; Rep., 562;&nbsp; Hearn <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. De Young,&nbsp; 119 Cal., 670.)<br><br>Before the commencement of the trial in&nbsp; the court below of the cause against the&nbsp; defendant Kalaw, he gave notice to the court that his defense consisted in proving the truth of each and all of the facts mentioned in said alleged libelous editorial.&nbsp;&nbsp; (See record, p. 219.)<br><br>Section 4 of Act No. 277 (the Libel Law) holds that the truth&nbsp; in&nbsp; criminal prosecutions for libel may be given in evidence&nbsp; to the court,&nbsp; and if&nbsp; it appears to the court that the matter charged as libelous is true,&nbsp; and was published with good motives and for justifiable ends,&nbsp; the party shall be&nbsp; acquitted; otherwise he shall be convicted; but to establish this defense&nbsp; (the truth of the publication), not only must&nbsp; (<i>a</i>)&nbsp; the&nbsp; truth of the matter&nbsp; so charged be&nbsp; proven, but also&nbsp; (<i>b</i>) that it was published&nbsp; with good motives and for justifiable&nbsp; ends.&nbsp; Then, under this&nbsp; section the alleged libelous matter must not only <i>be proved to be true</i>, in order to constitute a defense, but it must be proved that it was published <i>both </i>with good&nbsp; motives and for justifiable&nbsp; ends.<br><br>In&nbsp; the present case the&nbsp; lower&nbsp; court found from&nbsp; the evidence that the proof adduced by the defense did not prove the truth of the facts&nbsp; charged in the alleged libelous editorial.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon an examination of the evidence brought to this court, we are of the opinion that&nbsp; the evidence adduced by the defendant in&nbsp; no way approaches proving the truth of the&nbsp; libelous&nbsp; allegations.&nbsp; The law will&nbsp; not allow one person to injure another by an injurious publication under the cloak of "good&nbsp; ends" or&nbsp; "justifiable motives," when, as a matter of fact, the publication was made with malicious intent.&nbsp; When malice in fact is found to exist, the publisher can not be relieved from liability by pretense of "justifiable motives."&nbsp; The&nbsp; publication&nbsp; of&nbsp; a&nbsp; malicious&nbsp; defamation, whether it be true or not, is clearly an offense under Act No. 277.&nbsp;&nbsp; (U.&nbsp; S. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Bustos, 13 Phil. Rep.,&nbsp; 690; U. S.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Prautch, 10 Phil. Rep., 562.)&nbsp;&nbsp; The truth of the facts stated in the alleged libelous&nbsp; editorial not having been proved, the defense of "good motives" and "justifiable ends"&nbsp; can not be sustained.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Sec. 4, Act No. 277; U. S. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Lerma (2 Phil. Rep., 254) ; U. S.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Crozier (5 Phil. Rep., 621); U. S.. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Prautch,&nbsp; supra; U. S. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Bustos, supra.)<br><br>The lower court committed no error in holding that the defense&nbsp; of "justifiable motives" was not shown in publishing the alleged libelous article.<br><center><br>SPECIAL DEFENSES OF THE APPELLANT FIDEL A. REYES.</center><br>The appellant Fidel A. Reyes, in&nbsp; addition to the&nbsp; assignments of error above discussed, also made the following assignment of error:<br><blockquote>"3. The court erred in holding that the defendant published and caused to be&nbsp; published the editorial referred to in the complaint, and in convicting him of said crime." The lower&nbsp; court&nbsp; in rendering its decision&nbsp; against this defendant (Reyes) said:<br><br>"This&nbsp; defendant (Fidel A.&nbsp; Reyes) is the chief editor of the newspaper 'El Renacimiento' as the word editor&nbsp; is used in section 6 of Act No. 277 above referred to, and as such editor is chargeable with the&nbsp; publication of the article set forth in&nbsp; the complaint."</blockquote>The Solicitor-General, after discussing the&nbsp; evidence pro and con&nbsp; relating to the&nbsp; defendant Reyes,&nbsp; refused to make any recommendation concerning him.<br><br>The evidence shows that Fidel A. Reyes was the <i>redactor jefe</i> of&nbsp; "El Renacimiento"&nbsp; at the time of the publication of the said alleged libelous editorial.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many witnesses were called for the purpose of showing the duties of the redactor jefe.&nbsp; The conclusions of the Solicitor-General relating to the said duties are found in the following quotation:<br><blockquote>"The&nbsp; duties&nbsp; of the <i>redactor jefe</i>&nbsp; are in general to centralize and examine rough&nbsp; copy which comes&nbsp; in, requests for publication, etc., and to properly edit it, and this work he afterwards&nbsp; submits to&nbsp; the directors, without whose approval it can not be published."</blockquote>W. B. Watson was called as a witness on rebuttal&nbsp; by the Government, and&nbsp; testified&nbsp; that the position&nbsp; of&nbsp; <i>redactor jefe</i> corresponded generally&nbsp; to that of city&nbsp; editor on&nbsp; American papers, who oversee news matter, edit the reporter's copy, and can write editorials,&nbsp; which,&nbsp; if approved, are published.<br><br>Macario Adriatico was called&nbsp; as&nbsp; a witness,&nbsp; and after stating the experience which he had had as director of newspapers in the Philippine Islands, testified that the&nbsp; position of <i>redactor jefe </i>was subordinate&nbsp; to the director, and that the&nbsp; publication of&nbsp; editorials&nbsp; was&nbsp; exclusively under&nbsp; the control of the director.&nbsp; It appears from the evidence, under the system of editing publications&nbsp; in the Philippine Islands, that the <i>redactor jefe</i> has no&nbsp; control whatsoever of&nbsp; the publishing1 of newspapers.&nbsp; Neither&nbsp; was it proven in&nbsp; the present case that he was the author or proprietor of the said newspaper.&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>We find no sufficient evidence in the record to justify the conviction of the defendant, Fidel A. Reyes.</i><br><br>After a careful consideration of&nbsp; the record brought to this court, of the evidence adduced pro and con during the trial&nbsp; of the cause,&nbsp; and a full consideration of the&nbsp; law applicable to such facts, we have arrived at the following conclusions:<br><br>First. That the sentence of the lower court with reference to the defendant Martin Ocampo&nbsp; should&nbsp; be and is hereby affirmed, and he is hereby sentenced to be imprisoned for a period of six months and&nbsp; to pay&nbsp; a fine of&nbsp; P2,000, to&nbsp; pay one-fifth part of the costs&nbsp; of the action in the lower court and one-third part of the costs in this court, and in case of insolvency to suffer subsidiary imprisonment in accordance with the provisions of Act No. 1732.<br><br>Second. That the&nbsp; sentence&nbsp; of the&nbsp; lower court imposed upon the defendant Teodoro M.&nbsp; Kalaw, in view of the high character of the person libeled and the dignity of the office which&nbsp; he held at the time the libel&nbsp; was published,&nbsp; and in view of the fact that the defendant attempted to prove&nbsp; the truth of the&nbsp; alleged&nbsp; libelous publication and his failure so to do,&nbsp; thereby practically&nbsp; repeating and&nbsp; republishing&nbsp; the libel; and in&nbsp; view&nbsp; of the recommendation of the Attorney- General, we&nbsp; are of&nbsp; the opinion that the sentence&nbsp; of&nbsp; the lower&nbsp; court&nbsp; should&nbsp; be&nbsp; modified,&nbsp; and that&nbsp; the defendant Teodoro M. Kalaw should be sentenced to be imprisoned&nbsp; for a period of twelve months, to pay a fine of P3,000, one-fifth part of the costs of the action in the lower court and one- third part of the costs&nbsp; in this court, and&nbsp; in&nbsp; case&nbsp; of insolvency to suffer subsidiary imprisonment in accordance with the provisions of Act No. 1732.<br><br>Third. That the sentence of the lower court imposed upon the defendant Fidel A. Reyes, because of the insufficiency of the proof adduced during the trial of the cause, should be reversed and the complaint as to him should be dismissed, with costs de oficio.&nbsp; It is so ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano, C.
