				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On the 27th of July, 1907, Esteban Ranjo filed a written complaint&nbsp; with the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Norte, against Gregorio Salmon,&nbsp; Francisca Gonzalez,&nbsp; and Valeriano Tomas, alleging&nbsp; that he was the&nbsp; owner, by inheritr ance from&nbsp; his deceased mother, Dorotea Adiarte, of a tract of land used as a truck garden and a rice field, situated in the barrio of Rangtay, pueblo of Pasuquin, Ilocos Norte, with&nbsp; an area of about 2 hectares and 43 ares; that the property is bounded on the north by a path and land owned by Calixto Luna; on the east by lands belonging to Ubaldo Tagabilla, Eugenio Bias, and Timoteo Caliba; on the south by&nbsp; lands&nbsp; of the same Caliba,&nbsp; Agustin Menor, Macario Lagac,&nbsp; Cipriano Daquigan,&nbsp; Eugenio Bias,&nbsp; and&nbsp; a sandy tract; and on&nbsp; the west by&nbsp; another&nbsp; sandy tract;&nbsp; that&nbsp; in 1900&nbsp; (the exact date being unknown) he pledged the said land to&nbsp; Francisca Gonzalez for the sum of 100 pesos, with a right&nbsp; to redeem it upon repayment of the amount; that in 1904 Gonzalez transferred her rights in the said land upon&nbsp; the said conditions to Valeriano Tomas, who in 1906 transferred&nbsp; his&nbsp; right to&nbsp; Gregorio Salmon for the sum&nbsp; of P140; that the defendants having been amicably requested to return the land&nbsp; in question&nbsp; to the plaintiff, upon payment&nbsp; of the last-mentioned&nbsp; amount&nbsp; of the&nbsp; pledge&nbsp; made in favor of Salmon; that the latter refused to comply with the request, wherefore the plaintiff prayed that judgment be rendered ordering the defendants to deliver the above-described land to the plaintiff, upon repayment of P140&nbsp; to Gregorio Salmon, and to pay the costs.<br><br>Gregorio Salmon&nbsp; having been summoned, made written answer to the above complaint, stating that the lands mentioned therein were not the property of the plaintiff when they were sold&nbsp; to him by Valeriano Tomas, who was their exclusive owner, and therefore he prayed that judgment be rendered in his favor, and that the&nbsp; plaintiff be adjudged to pay the costs.<br><br>The other&nbsp; defendant, Francisca Gonzalez, stated in her answer&nbsp; that&nbsp; she admitted as true the facts on which the plaintiff based his complaint,&nbsp; and that she therefore agreed to the redemption of the land described therein, and prayed that judgment be rendered&nbsp; in favor&nbsp; of the said plaintiff with the costs against the defendant Salmon.<br><br>Valeriano Tomas&nbsp; died on July 28, 1907, as appears from Exhibit B of the plaintiff.<br><br>After the hearing of the case and the evidence adduced by both parties, the documents&nbsp; exhibited having been made part of the record, the judge,&nbsp; on the 20th of July, 1908, rendered judgment&nbsp; therein, sentencing Gregorio Salmon to deliver the land claimed to the&nbsp; plaintiff Esteban Ranjo, upon&nbsp; repayment of P140, and&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay the costs.&nbsp; Counsel for the defendant Ranjo excepted&nbsp; to this&nbsp; decision,&nbsp; and asked for the annulment thereof on the ground that it&nbsp; was not sufficiently sustained by the evidence, that the findings deduced from the facts were clearly and manifestly contrary to the weight of the evidence,&nbsp; and stated that, should his petition be&nbsp; denied, he&nbsp; excepted thereto and intended to file his&nbsp; bill of exceptions in the usual way; the motion&nbsp; was denied&nbsp; and&nbsp; the annulment asked&nbsp; for was declared to be improper, and&nbsp; his notice of intention to submit his bill of exceptions in the usual way having been admitted, the&nbsp; said bill of&nbsp; exceptions was&nbsp; prepared,&nbsp; certified, and approved, and thereafter filed with the clerk&nbsp; of this court.<br><br>It having been proved that Valeriano Tomas was not the owner of the&nbsp; land claimed by&nbsp; Esteban Ranjo, the allegation of Gregorio Salmon&nbsp; that it belonged to him can not be supported,&nbsp; since he&nbsp; acquired it by purchase&nbsp; from the said Tomas, who was not the&nbsp; owner.<br><br>Only the&nbsp; owner can&nbsp; dispose of property, without&nbsp; any other&nbsp; limitations than those prescribed by the law, and he has a right of action against the holder or possessor thereof to recover it.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Art. 348, Civil Code.)&nbsp; If Valeriano Tomas was not the owner, but a mere mortgage&nbsp; creditor of the land in question, he could not sell&nbsp; it nor convey any' right of&nbsp; ownership to the defendant Salmon notwithstanding the document exhibited&nbsp; by the said defendant and marked "A."<br><br>Article 1S59&nbsp; of the Civil Code reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"A&nbsp; creditor can not&nbsp; appropriate to himself the things given&nbsp; in pledge or mortgage, nor dispose of them."</blockquote>What the creditor is&nbsp; entitled to do, after&nbsp; the&nbsp; principal obligation has become due, is to ask&nbsp; for the alienation of the things constituting the pledge or mortgage,&nbsp; in order to&nbsp; secure reimbursement.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Art. 1858 of the same code.)<br><br>Valeriano Tomas, in order to obtain&nbsp; the 125 pesos he had loaned to Francisca Gonzalez, by way&nbsp; of mortgage on&nbsp; said land, conveyed his rights to Gregorio&nbsp; Salmon for the&nbsp; sum of&nbsp; 140 pesos,&nbsp; which was paid to him by the latter.&nbsp; Valeriano Tomas testified under oath to this effect in the document presented by the plaintiff (Exhibit A), which document was ratified before&nbsp; a notary, the contents of which confirm the statements made by Francisca Gonzalez in her written answer to the complaint, agreeing to the pretensions of the plaintiff, Ranjo, and&nbsp; directly contradict the contents of the document exhibited by the defendant Salmon as&nbsp; evidence of his allegation that he&nbsp; is&nbsp; the owner&nbsp; of the said land.&nbsp; The latter allegation is wholly&nbsp; unfounded,&nbsp; inasmuch as, if his title of ownership is derived, according to his answer to the complaint, from the right of the said Valeriano Tomas, it&nbsp; having been&nbsp; proved that&nbsp; the latter was not the owner of the land, but a mere creditor with the right to&nbsp; recover his credit&nbsp; from&nbsp; the proceeds of the sale of&nbsp; the property, it is undisputable that he could not dispose&nbsp; of the land nor sell it absolutely and finally to the defendant Salmon, as the latter pretends,&nbsp; basing&nbsp; his pretension&nbsp; on the said document of sale, which is notoriously inefficient because it is a contract wholly null and&nbsp; void.<br><br>The other defendant, Francisca Gonzalez, stated in her sworn&nbsp; testimony that after having held the land&nbsp; under mortgage for four years, and&nbsp; being&nbsp; in&nbsp; need of&nbsp; money, after having&nbsp; notified&nbsp; its&nbsp; owner Esteban Ranjo,&nbsp; she&nbsp; in turn mortgaged it to&nbsp; Valeriano Tomas, from whom&nbsp; she received&nbsp; 125&nbsp; pesos; no new document&nbsp; was then executed, but she simply indorsed the old one executed by&nbsp; her and Esteban Ranjo; the latter in his sworn testimony confirmed Gonzalez's statements and added that he had inherited the said land from his mother, and that&nbsp; it is at present in possession of&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant' Salmon, because the former mortgagee, Valeriano Tomas, had&nbsp; mortgaged it to him; and that, as Tomas assured him that upon paying Salmon the&nbsp; 140&nbsp; pesos received as loan he could recover the land without any objection, he went to see the defendant Salmon (because Tomas was sick), to redeem&nbsp; the land, and presented to him a letter from Tomas; but Salmon refused to receive the money, saying that he wanted to deliver the land to the&nbsp; same person from whom he had received it.<br><br>From the above-stated facts it appears that the document evidencing the mortgage,&nbsp; and&nbsp; which&nbsp; Francisca Gonzalez avers&nbsp; was&nbsp; executed&nbsp; and&nbsp; indorsed to&nbsp; Valeriano Tomas, must have been&nbsp; delivered to the last&nbsp; mortgagee, Gregorio Salmon; and the latter having failed to exhibit it at the trial (since&nbsp; the said document contains and shows the successive mortgages to&nbsp; which the land in question has been subjected),&nbsp; it must have been because&nbsp; it&nbsp; did not suit the defendant Salmon to produce such a document, which is evidently incompatible with the document of sale exhibited by him,&nbsp; the facts related&nbsp; by the&nbsp; plaintiff and&nbsp; Francisca Gonzalez being moreover corroborated by the notary, David Cleto, and by the witness, Alejandro Bias.<br><br>The character of the plaintiff, as owner of the land, is denied and questioned, but the defendant does not take into account the&nbsp; fact that&nbsp; he himself acknowledges and admits that he had acquired&nbsp; it from Valeriano Tomas;&nbsp; and, as it is a&nbsp; fact that the latter had in turn received it from Francisca Gonzalez, in whose favor it was mortgaged by Esteban Ranjo, it is&nbsp; undisputable that the&nbsp; first and true owner of the&nbsp; land mortgaged&nbsp; is the plaintiff,&nbsp; inasmuch&nbsp; as it has not been shown that&nbsp; it was Valeriano Tomas who, according to the defendant, sold and conveyed to him the land in controversy.<br><br>The act of selling or alienating real or personal property to another person conveys the ownership of the&nbsp; vendor as to the thing sold; one who is not the owner can not perform any&nbsp; act which would tranfer the ownership, nor could his pretended transferee&nbsp; acquire any&nbsp; rights in&nbsp; the&nbsp; property, because his&nbsp; vendor did not convey to&nbsp; him&nbsp; any right of ownership.<br><br>Therefore, the judgment appealed from being in accordance with the&nbsp; law and&nbsp; the merits of the&nbsp; case, it is&nbsp; our opinion that it&nbsp; should be and&nbsp; it&nbsp; is hereby&nbsp; affirmed,&nbsp; with the costs&nbsp; against the appellant.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J., Mapa, Johnson, Carson,</i> and <i>Moreland, JJ.</i>, concur.<br></div>
