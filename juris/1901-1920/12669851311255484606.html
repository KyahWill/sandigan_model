				G.R. No. 8956, February 04, 1914</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. FRANCISCO VALERA ANG Y, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The accused pleaded guilty in the court below to a charge of a violation of 
the Opium Law, in that, as set forth in the information, he was found with ten 
grams of opium ashes in his possession and under his control. The minimum 
penalty prescribed by law for this offense (a fine of P300) was imposed, and the 
only contention of counsel on this appeal is that this penalty is excessive.
<p>Whether or not the penalties prescribed by law upon conviction of violations 
of particular statutes are too severe or are not severe enough are questions as 
to which commentators on the law may fairly differ; but it is the duty of the 
courts to enforce the will of the legislator in all cases unless it clearly 
appears that a given penalty falls within the prohibited class of excessive 
fines or cruel and unusual punishments. Manifestly a fine of P300 prescribed for 
the violation of the provisions of the Opium Law does not fall within the 
prohibited class of penalties.</p>
<p>The question is not whether, in the opinion of the court, the minimum fine 
prescribed by law is in excess of that which the court might consider expedient 
or advisable were it called upon to prescribe such penalty. The exercise of 
discretion in this regard is conferred not upon the court but upon the 
legislator. Hence the courts will be justified in declaring a fine prescribed by 
statute to be excessive, only in those cases where it is so clearly so, 
considering the nature of the violation of the law for which it is prescribed, 
that all right-minded men will agree that it exceeds the utmost limit of 
punishment which the vindication of the law demands.</p>
<p>In a former case we discussed at length the nature and the gravity of the 
injury to the body politic which it is asserted would result from the unchecked 
spread of the opium habit, and we then expressed our belief that the legislator 
was clearly within his prerogative in enacting the statute defining and 
penalizing the unauthorized use of the drug and its derivatives. (U. S. 
<em>vs.</em> Lim Sing, 23 Phil. Rep.,424.) Adhering to the doctrine and the 
reasoning of that opinion we have no hesitation in holding that in prescribing a 
minimum penalty of P300 for the violations of the penal provisions of that 
statute, the legislator did not exceed the limits of the discretion conferred 
upon him in that regard, and that this penalty is not therefore excessive in the 
sense in which that word is used in the Philippine Bill of Rights.</p>
<p>The judgment of the lower court convicting and sentencing the defendant and 
appellant should be and is hereby affirmed, with the costs of this instance 
against him.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres</em> and<em> Trent, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>CONCURRING AND DISSENTING</strong></p>
<p><strong>MORELAND, J.</strong></p>
<p>I am in accord with the result in this case. I object, however, to the 
reference made to United States vs. Lim Sing (23 Phil. Rep., 424). That case, in 
so far as it sought to limit the trial court in the use of its discretion in the 
imposition of penalties under the Opium Law, has been repeatedly overruled by 
the practice of this court. While it has been followed in some instances, it has 
been disregarded in more. It has been and is utterly discredited as an 
authority. A case which has been disregarded and rejected as often, if not 
oftener than it has been followed, I do not consider an authority relative to 
the doctrine as to which it has been disregarded.</p>
<p>If the reference to the case were confined to some of the general principles 
therein referred to, I would have no objection ; but an attempt to reaffirm a 
doctrine, already thoroughly discredited, which takes away from Courts of First 
Instance the discretion which the legislature expressly gave them, which 
deprives them of the power to represent their districts judicially, which 
prohibits them from administering the law according to the needs of their 
provinces and thereby makes their knowledge of those provinces and of the 
history and status of crime therein utterly valueless, which takes from them the 
right of informing themselves relative to the criminal before them, his mental 
and physical condition, his antecedents and history, and make proper use of such 
information, which prevents them from considering the personal needs of the 
criminal with the object of uniting curative and punitive treatment, which 
denies them the right to use the faculty of observation at trials and of making 
deductions therefrom, which puts discretion in bonds and judgment in stocks, 
which makes trial courts not trial courts but referees to take testimony for 
submission to the Supreme Court, which makes them automatons moving and acting 
by the substituted judgment of the Supreme Court, which, while it does not 
relieve them of the grave responsibility of properly administering the law in 
their districts placed upon them by the legislature, robs them of the ability to 
meet and discharge that responsibility adequately, which repeals the law 
establishing discretional penalties and substitutes in its place a court-made 
law instituting the system of fixed penalties, which overrules the doctrine 
universally accepted that an appellate court will not interfere with a trial 
court acting in the exercise of its discretion unless a clear abuse thereof is 
affirmatively shown and that the judgment of a trial court imposing a criminal 
penalty which is within his discretion is not subject to review by an appellate 
court, which lays down the proposition that a court which is expressly 
authorized by statute to impose,<em> in its discretion,</em> a fine of from P300 
to P10,000, commits a reversible error when it imposes P400; an attempt to 
reaffirm a doctrine doing or tending to do these things meets my instant 
opposition.<br></p></div>
