				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This case having been duly tried, judgment was rendered convicting the defendant of the crime charged.  The defendant appealed to this court, wherein he has made the following assignment of errors alleged to have been  committed  at  the trial  and in the  rendition of judgment, to wit: </p>
<p>(1)  That the court  never acquired jurisdiction to  hear and determine the case against the defendant by reason of the lack of all preliminary investigation.</p>
<p>(2) That the court erred in overruling the demurrer to the complaint interposed by defendant.</p>
<p>(3) That the  evidence  adduced did not  establish the guilt of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>There is nothing in the appellant's brief relating to the matters of the case showing that the court below committed the last two errors assigned by him.  He is therefore bound by the findings of the court below and the  order of that court overruling the demurrer, he not having raised any question in regard thereto.</p>
<p>As to the first assignment of error it is  alleged (1.) that no preliminary investigation was had, and  (2)  that the only  deposition taken at the time of  the issuance of the warrant of arrest was that of the complaining witness, who never signed.  These were the same grounds upon which defendant's motion to dismiss the case in the Court of First Instance were based, and that court, in its order overruling the said motion, said:</p>
<p>"Considering that a preliminary investigation was made by this court before the allowance of the complaint, and before the issuance of the warrant for the  arrest of the defendant, and further,  that the matter which is alleged to be libelous is embodied in the said complaint, this being the reason why such preliminary investigation consisted of the deposition  of the complaining  witness, Mr. Haussermann,  only, and which said deposition  has not  been attached to the record for the reason that it  is not a part of the same but which may be attached thereto if the court should deem it proper, etc.,  *  *  *"  (record, p. 21).</p>
<p>Counsel for the defendant presented a motion to this court which was granted, asking that the Court of First Instance be ordered to send up to this court the deposition to which reference is made in the order of the court above referred to.  This deposition appears on page 26  of the record and  it purports to be a deposition taken by the stenographer but not signed  by the witness.</p>
<p>If the signature of a witness to testimony given by him at a  trial when  such testimony has  been  taken  by an official stenographer is not necessary according to section 32  of  General Orders, No.  58, much less  should such signature, be required in &amp; preliminary investigation, but however it may be, this was a mere formal defect that could not in any way affect the validity of the proceedings and constituted no error.</p>
<p>Moreover, the  complaint was filed in  the month of August, 1904,  when Act Hfo. 612, approved  February 3, 1903, was in force.   Section 2 of that act provided: "In cases triable only in the Courts of First Instance in the city of Manila, the defendant shall have a speedy trial, but shall  not  be entitled as of  right  to  a  preliminary examination where  the prosecuting attorney, after  a due investigation of the facts under section 39 of the act of which this is an amendment, shall  have presented an information against him in the proper form: <em>Provided, however</em>, That the Court of First  Instance may make such summary investigation into the case as.it may deem  necessary to enable it to fix the bail  or to determine whether the offense is bailable."</p>
<p>The court, acting upon the complaint filed in this case, issued a .warrant for the arrest of  the defendant, taking into consideration for this purpose the result of the investigation  held  by him with  the  assistance  of  the assistant prosecuting  attorney of the  city  of  Manila,  Jesse George, the court being of the opinion that the crime of libel with which  the accused was charged had been committed, and that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the party charged had  committed it (record, p. 7). Such, and no other, is the purpose of sections 13 and 14 of General Orders, No. 58.  They require that a preliminary investigation be held by the court for the purpose only of inquiring as to whether there is reasonable ground either to order the arrest of the party charged or to direct that he be released from  confinement in case  he has been held in detention for the commission of an alleged crime.</p>
<p>There was, therefore, no lack of preliminary investigation in this case.  Investigation made by the judge was not substantially defective, nor was it necessary, and this is the most important, the complaint having been, presented to the Court of First Instance  of  the city of Manila, in which an accused person is  not  entitled, as a matter of right, to a preliminary examination.  Consequently no law or statute has been violated by the court below, and due process of law has not been lacking.</p>
<p>The trial court sentenced the defendant to subsidiary imprisonment in default of payment of the fine imposed, but the act punishing the crime of libel is a special law and no penalty can be imposed except that which is expressly provided therein. That act does not make any provision for subsidiary imprisonment.</p>
<p>We accordingly affirm the judgment of the trial court in all respects, except in so far as it condemns the defendant to subsidiary imprisonment, the defendant to pay the costs of proceedings.  Ten days after the rendition of final judgment, let the record  be remanded to the  court below for execution.  So  ordered.</p>

<em>DISSENTING</em></div>
<p><strong>CARSON, J.:</strong></p>
<p>I dissent.</p>
<p>The sentence imposed  by  the trial court deprives the accused of his liberty and of his property "without due process of law."</p>
<p>Against his objection, which was  submitted in due time, and upon a complaint signed and submitted by a private citizen, the accused was f orqed to trial, convicted of a <em>delito</em> (felony), and sentenced to imprisonment and to the payment of  a fine, without a preliminary trial and without even a preliminary  investigation for the purpose of ascertaining whether there was "probable cause" for committing him to stand trial for the offense charged.</p>
<p>It is contended that under existing laws in these Islands an accused person  is not entitled to a preliminary trial "as of right,"  nor to any preliminary investigation as to his probable guilt, other than that upon which the  magistrate who orders his arrest bases such order.   I am convinced, however, that the provisions of  General Orders, No. 58, and the acts of the Philippine Commission  secure the right to a preliminary trial to every person charged with a <em>delito</em> (felony), except only in those cases wherein the  prosecuting  attorney  of the city of Manila files an <em>information</em> after an investigation, as provided in section 2 of Act No. 612; and I am further convinced that section 5 of an act of Congress enacted July 1, 1902, which provided that "no law shall be enacted in these Islands which shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law," guarantees to the inhabitants of the Philippine Islands the right not to be put on trial for a <em>delito</em> (felony) over their objection without some orderly inquiry  either by way of a preliminary trial before a magistrate, an indictment by grand jury, or some other proceeding reasonably adapted to secure the ends contemplated by these methods of preliminary investigation—that is, to  determine whether  there is reasonable ground to believe that a crime  has been committed and that the accused committed it.</p>
<p>Section 13 of General Orders, No. 58, is as  follows:</p>
<p>"When a  complaint or information alleging the  commission of a crime  is laid before  a magistrate he must examine,  on oath, the informant or  prosecutor and  the witnesses produced,  and take their depositions in writing, causing them to be subscribed by the parties making them. If the  magistrate be satisfied from the investigation that the crime complained of has been  committed, and  that there is reasonable ground to believe that the party charged has committed it, he  must issue an order for his arrest.   If the offense be bailable, and the defendant offers a sufficient security, he shall  be admitted to bail; otherwise he shall be committed to prison."</p>
<p>Section 14 of the said orders is as follows:</p>
<p>"If the magistrate shall believe from the evidence submitted, either that the crime complained of was not committed, or that, if committed, the person charged did  not commit it, he must  set the person  at liberty; but such release shall not prevent the filing of a new complaint or information and the arrest of the'accused thereon at any time before  the prosecution of the offense shall be barred by the statute..  In  case the promotor fiscal  may appeal from the order of release, the judge shall subject the accused to such inspection and measures of vigilance as may be deemed prudent to prevent his escape."</p>
<p>Section 15 of said orders provides that:</p>
<p>"In all criminal  prosecutions the defendant shall  be entitled (1) to appear and defend in person and by counsel at every stage of the proceedings."</p>
<p>Counsel for the prosecution insists that these sections merely provide  for  an examination of  the informant or prosecutor and such witnesses as may be produced at the time when  the  complaint or information is lodged and before the accused is arrested, and that if on this testimony the magistrate is of opinion that there is reasonable ground to believe that the offense charged (even though it be a capital crime) has been committed by the accused, he may not only order the arrest of the accused  but direct that he be held for trial without further investigation.  I do not believe that this proposition can survive  a careful scrutiny of the foregoing sections of the law.</p>
<p>If there is to be no further investigation after the issuing of the  order  for arrest as provided in  section  13, what possible meaning can be given to section 14, which provides that if the magistrate shall believe that the person charged with a crime did not commit it, he  must set the person at liberty?  How is the magistrate who, before the arrest, on the evidence then taken, was  of opinion that there was ground to believe that a crime had been committed and that the accused committed it, to change his mind and to come tQ the belief either that no crime was committed or that, if committed,  the person charged did not commit it, <em>unless after the arrest he continues the inquiry or institutes a new inquiry and as a result of testimony then produced</em> is forced to conclude that in the light of the new evidence there is not  reasonable ground to believe  the accused guilty as charged?</p>
<p>I admit that the language of these sections is somewhat obscure and does not clearly  and adequately prescribe the mode in which the investigation is to proceed after the arrest of the accused, but it is evident that the committing magistrate must at least take such further testimony pertinent to the issue,  including evidence on behalf  of the accusecfy as may be  produced, so that when his order is issued either committing the accused for trial or setting him at liberty, that order shall not rest on his mere arbitrary exercise of power but on the exercise of his sound judicial  discretion on all the available testimony;  and it would further appear that since the accused is entitled  to appear and defend himself  in person and  by counsel  at every stage of the  proceedings, he should be given  an opportunity to be present during the taking of this testimony.</p>
<p>General Orders,  No. 58, which was issued in the early days of  the American military occupation of the Philippines, implanted in these Islands a new system of criminal procedure which practically did away with the old Spanish Code, and substituted therefor a system  based upon the procedure in the courts of the United States and the various States of the Union.  They consist, however, of but 110 short sections, occupying a little less than 13 pages of the volume of the acts of the Commission wherein they are printed,  and it has been necessary for the courts at every stage of  the proceedings to give life to this bare skeleton of the law of criminal procedure, breathing into it the spirit of American criminal jurisprudence, interpreting its provisions in accordance with generally accepted authorities on American law, and applying it in accordance with the recognized practice in the courts of the country from which it was brought.</p>
<p>Sections 13 and 14, above cited, undertake to provide all the necessary steps in a criminal  prosecution  from  the iiling of  a complaint or information to the institution of the trial, but they would prove wholly inadequate and unintelligible unless construed and applied with the aid of the generally accepted rules of  practice in the United States.   Examined from this point of view, I can not doubt that they not only provide for but prescribe a preliminary trial, and that when an accused is denied  the right thus secured to  him, a sentence based on such proceedings is imposed  without due process of law.</p>
<p>Later  legislation touching  the  same subject-matter, if it does not expressly provide  for preliminary trials as of right, at least clearly indicates that the legislator was of opinion that such right existed  and legislated in contemplation thereof.   Section 2 of Act No. 612 of the Philippine Commission, amending Act No.  183, provides  that  "in cases triable only in the Court of First Instance in  the city  of Manila,  the defendant shall have  a speedy trial, but shall not be entitled, as  of right, to a preliminary examination in any case where  the prosecuting attorney, after due examination of the facts under section 39 of the act of which this is an amendment, shall  have presented an information against him in proper form."  It is clear that  the authors of this act were of opinion that this right existed prior to its enactment, and it is worthy of note that  the  legislator did not presume to do away with this right even in those cases wherein an "information" is. filed by the prosecuting attorney of the city of Manila  without providing a substitute in the nature of a sworn investigation by the prosecuting attorney as provided in section 39 of Act No. 183.   In the case at bar the complaint is signed by a  private citizen and not by  the  prosecuting attorney of the city of Manila, and no  such investigation was had as is  provided for in the above-mentioned section 39 of Act No. 183.</p>
<p>But the right of the inhabitants of these Islands not to be forced to trial for grave offenses without some  orderly and appropriate proceeding for the purpose of establishing a  "probable cause" rests  on a still broader and firmer foundation than the express or implied provisions of local law and is guaranteed by Congressional enactment in the very language of the Constitution of the United States.</p>
<p>Section 5 of an act of Congress, enacted July  1, 1902, provides  that "no law shall be  enacted in said Islands which shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law."</p>
<p>Any system of criminal procedure which wholly denies the right of individual citizens to  be secure  from the trouble, expense, anxiety,  and risk of trial for grave offenses for which an infamous punishment is prescribed by law until "probable cause" is established is, as I understand it, prohibited by this constitutional provision, except, perhaps, in those cases where the State's attorney files an "information" which itself implies a preliminary investigation of the facts  by a sworn officer  of  the law and his statement  upon his  official oath that he has  reasonable grounds to believe the accused is guilty as charged.</p>
<p>In the case of Hurtado <em>vs</em>. California, the Supreme Court of the United States uses the following language:</p>
<p>"But it is not to be supposed that these legislative powers are absolute and despotic, and that the amendment prescribing due process of law is too vague  and indefinite to operate as a practical restraint.   It is not every act, legislative in  form, that  is law.  Law is something  more than mere will exerted as an act of power. It must be not a special  rule for a particular person or a particular case, but, in the language of  Webster, in his familiar definition, 'the general law, a law  which hears before it condemns, which proceeds upon inquiry, and renders judgment only after trial so 'that every citizen shall hold his life, liberty, property, and immunities under the protection of the general rules which govern society/ and thus excluding, as not due process of law, acts of attainder, bills of pains and „ penalties, acts of confiscation, acts reversing judgments, and acts directly transferring  one man's estate to another, legislative  judgments  and  decrees,  and  other similar  special, partial, and arbitrary exertions of power under the iforia of legislation.  Arbitrary power, enforcing its edicts to the injury of the persons and property of its subjects, is not law,  whether manifested  as the decree of a personal  monarch or of an impersonal multitude.  And the limitations imposed by our constitutional  law upon the action  of the governments, both  State and national, are essential  to the preservation  of  public and private rights,  notwithstanding the representative  character  of our political institutions.  The enforcement of these limitations by judicial process is the device of selfcommunities to protect the rights of individuals and minorities, as well against the power of numbers as against the violence of public agents transcending the limits of lawful authority, even when acting in the name and wielding the force of the government.</p>
<p>"The supreme court of Mississippi, in a well-considered case, Brown  <em>vs</em>. Levee  Commissioners (50 Miss., 468), speaking of the meaning of the phrase 'due process of law says:</p>
<p>"'The principle does not  demand that the laws existing at any point of time shall be  irrepealahle, or  that any forms of remedies shall necessarily continue.  It refers to certain fundamental rights which that system of jurisprudence,  of which ours is  a derivative, has always recognized.  If any of these are disregarded in the proceedings by which a person is condemned to the loss of life, liberty, or property, then the deprivation  has not been by  "due process of  law."'</p>
<p>"This court, speaking by Mr. Justice  Miller, in Loan Association <em>vs</em>. Topeka (20 Wall., 655-662), said:</p>
<p>" 'It must be conceded that there are such rights in every free Government beyond the control of the State.  A Government which recognized no such rights, which held the lives, the  liberty, and the property of its citizens subject at all times to the absolute disposition and unlimited control of  even the most democratic depository of power, is after all but a despotism.   It is true it is a despotism of the many,  of the majority, if you choose to call it so, but it is nevertheless a despotism.   It may be doubted, if a man is to hold all that he is accustomed to call his own, all in which he has placed his  happiness and the security of which is essential to that happiness, under the unlimited dominion of others, whether it is not wiser that this power should be exercised by one man than by many.'</p>
<p>"It follows that any legal  proceeding enforced by public authority, whether sanctioned by age and custom,  or newly devised in  the discretion of the legislative power, in furtherance of the general  public  good, which regards and preserves these principles of liberty and justice, must be held to  be  due process of law."</p>
<p>And the  opinion of the court concludes:</p>
<p>"Tried by these principles, we are unable to  say  that the substitution for  a presentment or indictment  by .a grand jury of the proceeding by information, after examination and commitment by a magistrate, certifying to the probable guilt of the defendant, with the right on his part to the aid of counsel and to the cross-examination of the witnesses produced for the prosecution, is not due process of law.  It is, as we have seen, an ancient proceeding at common law, which might include every case of an offense of less grade than a felony, except misprision of treason; and in every circumstance of its administration, as authorized by the statute of California, it carefully considers and guards the substantial interest of the prisoner."</p>
<p>In its  opinion the court discussed at length the meaning and effect of the words "due process of Jaw" as used in the Constitution, with especial reference to  the  right of the legislature of any particular State to  provide any other mode of procedure in bringing to trial a person accused of a capital offense than the ancient method of presentment or indictment by a grand jury, and affirmed this right. The question here, however, is not whether a particular form of  preliminary  inquiry  to ascertain probable cause must be adopted,  but whether the accused shall be entitled to any inquiry at  all, and it appears that the right not to be forced to trial  for a <em>delito</em> (felony) on the complaint of a private citizen is "one of those fundamental rights which that system of jurisprudence of which ours is a derivative," as well as the Spanish system for which it has been substituted,  have "always recognized."</p>
<p>My attention has .not been directed to a  single case in the courts of England  or of the United States, or of the separate States and Territories of  the United States, from the enactment of  the  Bill of Rights to the present  day, wherein  a person  accused of a felony was forced to trial against his objection upon the complaint of a private citizen and without  some form or other of preliminary  examination or inquiry to determine whether there was or was not probable cause; and under the Spanish system of criminal procedure  the <em>juicio  plenario </em>(trial),  when  the accused was charged with a <em>delito</em> (felony), was always and necessarily preceded by the <em>juicio sumario </em>(preliminary investigation),  and the accused was discharged without entering on the stage of the proceedings known as the <em>juicio plenario </em>(trial) unless it appeared that there was "probable cause." It would seem that if  a right thus uniformly and universally secured is "disregarded in  a procedure by which  a person is condemned to the loss of life, liberty, or property, then the deprivation has not been by 'due process of law;' " and although the decision of Hurtado vs. California establishes the right of an individual State to adopt  such mode of inquiry, by grand jury  or otherwise,  as  it  may deem proper, it nevertheless does not deny, and on the contrary seems to sustain, the right  of the accused to some system of preliminary proceeding  which  "considers and  secures the  substantial interest of  the prisoner" at this stage  of a criminal  proceeding.</p>
