				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The plaintiff and appellant arrived at the port of&nbsp; Cebu on the 19th of November, 1914, on the steamship <span style="font-style: italic;">Linan</span>, and asked permission to enter the Philippine Islands.&nbsp; An investigation was held by the board of special&nbsp; inquiry who denied the petition of&nbsp; the plaintiff.<br><br>An&nbsp; appeal was taken&nbsp; to the Collector of Customs, the Honorable.B. Herstein, who, after considering the facts, affirmed the decision of the board of special inquiry and ordered the said Cang Kai Guan deported.<br><br>Later a petition for the writ of habeas corpus was presented in the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of Cebu.&nbsp;&nbsp; The cause was submitted to the Honorable Adolph Wislizenus, judge, who, after hearing the respective parties, denied the petition for the writ of habeas&nbsp; corpus.&nbsp; From that decision the plaintiff appeals to this court and makes several assignments of error.<br><br>From an examination of the record, the&nbsp; following&nbsp; facts appear to be undisputed: (first) that the plaintiff arrived at the port of Cebu on the 19th of November, 1914, on the steamship Linan, and asked permission to enter the Philippine Islands; (second)&nbsp; that he was born in&nbsp; China and was a Chinaman;&nbsp; (third) that he was eighteen years of&nbsp; age; (fourth) that he had never been in the Philippine Islands; (fifth) that his father had died in China about six years before; that his father, for some&nbsp; years before&nbsp; his death, had been a merchant in the Philippine Islands; (sixth)&nbsp; that he was not possessed of the "section six certificate."<br><br>The foregoing facts present the question whether or not the minor son of a Chinese merchant may enter the Philippine Islands without the "section six certificate" after the death of his father.&nbsp;&nbsp; This question has been fully discussed in the case of Tan Lin Jo <i>vs.</i> Collector of Customs (p. 78, ante), and there held that such minor can not enter the Philippine&nbsp; Islands without&nbsp; the&nbsp; "section six&nbsp; certificate." And without repeating&nbsp; here the&nbsp; arguments in that&nbsp; case, the judgment of the&nbsp; Court of First Instance is hereby affirmed with costs.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Arellano, C, J., Torres, Carson</span>,&nbsp; and <span style="font-style: italic;">Araullo, JJ.,</span> concur.<br></div>
