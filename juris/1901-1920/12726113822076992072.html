				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This was an action, or motion rather, presented in the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Province&nbsp; of Capiz by the plaintiff for the purpose of securing a modification of a judgment for costs theretofore rendered.&nbsp; The motion was denied,&nbsp; and the plaintiff now appeals to this court.<br><br>It appears that at a certain election the plaintiff and the defendant herein were each candidates for governor of the Province of Capiz.&nbsp; Upon a canvass&nbsp; of the returns, it was&nbsp; found that the defendant, Jose Altavas, had been elected governor by a majority of the votes, whereupon the plaintiff, Ramon Hontiveros, presented a protest and asked that the election returns from the various municipalities be revised.&nbsp; At that time, in accordance&nbsp; with section 27 of Act No. 1582, he presented a bond guaranteeing the payment&nbsp; of all of the costs which might be incurred by reason of his protest.&nbsp; The said returns were recanvassed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The votes&nbsp; were recounted and it was declared by the canvassing board that Ramon Hontiveros had received a majority of the votes.&nbsp; An appeal was&nbsp; taken&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Supreme Court where all of the questions were considered and the decision of the lower court was&nbsp; revoked "without costs to either party in this court."&nbsp; The cause was returned to the lower court, and later the motion in&nbsp; the present case was&nbsp; presented.<br><br>It appears from the admission of the appellant, Hontiveros, that the&nbsp; lower&nbsp; court, in the first instance,&nbsp; had rendered a judgment against him for costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; That&nbsp; part of the judgment of&nbsp; the&nbsp; lower court was not modified in the slightest degree by the decision of this court.&nbsp; (Hontiveros <i>vs.</i>.&nbsp; Altavas, 26 Phil.&nbsp; Rep., 213.)&nbsp; Considering the provisions of section 27 of Act No. 1582, in relation with section 2 of Act No. 2170, we are of the opinion and so hold, that the plaintiff is&nbsp; under obligation to pay the costs incurred by reason of his&nbsp; protest.<br><br>The judgment of the lower court, refusing to modify the judgment theretofore rendered against the plaintiff for costs, is hereby affirmed, with costs.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Carson, Trent,</i> and <i>Araullo, JJ.,</i> concur.&nbsp; </div>
