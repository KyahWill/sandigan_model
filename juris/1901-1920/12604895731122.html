				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Counsel for the defendants has petitioned the court to grant the defendants  the benefit of the amnesty.  This raises a question which, if decided in the affirmative, will make it unnecessary to decide the principal issue  in  the case.</p>
<p> The defendant Alhambra on the date in question was the commanding officer of the revolutionary forces of  the zone in which was included the  town of Puncan,  in  the Province of  Nueva Ecija,  in whose jurisdiction the crime prosecuted was committed.  In obedience to an order given by him  to his codefendants, who were  his soldiers,  the latter, one day in the month of February,  1900, captured and killed Leopoldo Palacios and his family.  These facts are, in our opinion, fully  proven  in the case.  Among  the evidence introduced by the prosecution are included certain sworn statements  made by some of the defendants in November, 1901, before Lieutenant Taylor, of the United States Army, of  which the originals were attached  to  the record at the request of counsel for the  Government.  It may be said  that to a certain extent these statements constituted the sole  direct  proof of the killing of Palacios and his family, if we exclude the testimony of  the defendants themselves in  the  preliminary investigation held  before the provincial fiscal, which they withdrew at the trial.</p>
<p> In their statements made before Lieutenant  Taylor two of the deponents, Maximo del Castillo and Anacleto Olengco, affirm that Alhambra ordered the capture  and killing of Palacios and his family because he suspected that they were secret  <em>police or  spies  of the Americans.</em>  Ciriaco Reyes, a witness for the prosecution, substantially corroborates this statement.  He  says that the motive which led Alhambra to give the order was that Leopoldo <em>intended to surrender  to the Americans.</em>  The complaining  witness, Crisanto  Sanchez,  brother-in-law  of  Leopoldo Palacios, also testifies, on page  60,  that Alhambra wanted to  kill him too, because he believed that the witness was <em>a member of the secret police.</em>  This statement is  corroborated  by that of the witness Ciriaco Reyes,  just mentioned.</p>
<p> We have no reason to doubt the sincerity of the testimony given by the accused before Lieutenant Taylor, not only because their statements were not controverted in the course? of the trial, they, on the contrary,  having been used as proof by the prosecution, but also because it can not be presumed that they gave this testimony with the self-serving  purpose of availing themselves of the benefit  of the amnesty, for the simple reason that the amnesty proclama- tion was not promulgated until eight months later, that is, on the 4th of July,  1902.   The sincerity  of these statements is still more (dearly shown by the  fact that they have been  corroborated  with respect to the motive which led the defendants to commit the crime prosecuted by the very  satisfactory testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution.</p>
<p> In  view of the character of the motives referred to,  and which were due to the belief on the part of  the defendants that  Leopohlo Palacios  and his  family were spies of the American Army, and therefore their political enemies, we hold  that the crime  in  question, in its  complex character of murder with robbery, was a result  of internal political  hatred or dissensions  of a  political nature  between Filipinos, manifested  in this case by reprisals,  not only on the person  but also on the property of  those whom they considered open enemies of the cause which they supported and  defended; that the  defendants committed said crime while insurgents and during the insurrection against the United States; and that they are therefore  entitled to the benefits of the amnesty .proclamation of July 4, 1902.</p>
<p> We therefore declare that the  said defendants are pardoned, subject to taking the oath prescribed by the amnesty proclamation.   So ordered.</p>
<p> <em> Arellano, C.J., Cooper,</em> and <em>Ladd, JJ., </em>concur.</p>
<p>  <strong>WILLARD, J.:</strong></p>
<p> I agree with the result.</p>
<p> <strong>TORRES, J.:</strong></p>
<p> I am of the opinion that the accused  should be pardoned as to  the crime of murder,  but convicted of the crime of robbery in a band.</p>
