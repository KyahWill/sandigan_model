				<BR><STRONG>MORELAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of the&nbsp; Province of Nueva Ecija, Hon. Julio Llorente&nbsp; presiding,&nbsp; convicting&nbsp; the&nbsp; accused of the crime&nbsp; of malversation of public funds and&nbsp; sentencing&nbsp; him to&nbsp; six months' imprisonment, to the payment of the costs, and to perpetual disability to&nbsp; hold public office or employment of any kind.<br><br>Simeon Quiaoit, the appellant in this case, acting as justice of the peace of the municipality of Nampicuan, Province of Nueva Ecija, for the purpose of a preliminary investigation, took cognizance of a crime charging two Chinamen, Ong&nbsp; Taichon and&nbsp; Yu&nbsp; Yong,&nbsp; with&nbsp; the illegal possession of opium in violation of Act&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 1761. On the arrest of the Chinamen&nbsp; the&nbsp; official&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Internal Revenue Office found in their possession&nbsp; 125 grams&nbsp; of prepared opium. The appellant in this case receipted for such opium, manifesting that he had received the same into his possession as a&nbsp; part of the&nbsp; proofs against the&nbsp; accused&nbsp; Chinamen. On the day on which the preliminary investigation was held, which was sixteen&nbsp; days after the accused&nbsp; Chinamen were arrested and the opium was delivered&nbsp; into the possession of the appellant, the internal-revenue officer claimed to have discovered that the opium, deposited&nbsp; with the appellant as acting justice&nbsp; of the peace&nbsp; on the arrest of the accused Chinamen, had disappeared and in its&nbsp; place had been substituted&nbsp; 123&nbsp; grams of&nbsp; honey&nbsp; or black sugar.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thereupon an information was filed charging the appellant with the crime of malversation of public property under Act No. 1740.<br><br>The attorney for the people discusses the question whether or not&nbsp; the&nbsp; accused is guilty of&nbsp; malversation of&nbsp; public property under the&nbsp; act&nbsp; referred to or whether he is guilty of <i>estafa </i>under subdivision 5 of article 535 of the Penal Code, concluding that&nbsp; he is guilty&nbsp; of <i>estafa</i>&nbsp; and&nbsp; not of malversation.<br><br>We find it unnecessary to discuss this question for the reason that upon the facts we are&nbsp; satisfied that the appellant has&nbsp; not&nbsp; been proved guilty&nbsp; of any crime&nbsp; beyond a&nbsp; reasonable doubt.&nbsp; No sufficient or&nbsp; satisfactory proof was made of the character or constituency of the 123 grams of substance which was found substituted&nbsp; in&nbsp; place of the opium sixteen days after its&nbsp; deposit&nbsp; with the appellant, admitting that there was a substitution.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no satisfactory proof&nbsp; that the&nbsp; substance was not&nbsp; the&nbsp; same substance that&nbsp; had&nbsp; been&nbsp; delivered&nbsp; to the&nbsp; appellant.&nbsp;&nbsp; This means that there is no satisfactory proof that there was a substitution.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; difference in weight may easily be accounted for by evaporation of the liquid&nbsp; or other causes, it appearing&nbsp; from the proofs that the receptacle in which the substance was at the time of its delivery to the appellant was open and&nbsp; without covering of any&nbsp; kind.&nbsp;&nbsp; The proofs as to the actual composition of the substance in controversy are&nbsp; scanty,&nbsp; indefinite&nbsp; and altogether unsatisfactory.&nbsp; It appears from the record that an expert pharmacist, testifying as a witness for the defendant, asserted that the substance which the prosecution alleges was&nbsp; either&nbsp; honey&nbsp; or black sugar did not contain either of those substances.&nbsp; We do not believe that the proofs fairly sustain the judgment of conviction.<br><br>The judgment of conviction is reversed and the discharge of the&nbsp; accused from custody ordered forthwith.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J., Mapa, Carson,</i> and <i>Trent, JJ.</i>, concur.<br></div>
