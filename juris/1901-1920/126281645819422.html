				G.R. No. 1382, October 26, 1906</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. QUE BING ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The defendants in this case were convicted in the municipal court of the city of Manila of a violation of section 3 of Ordinance No. 2 of the city of  Manila,  prohibiting gambling.  From  the judgment of conviction they appealed to the Court of First Instance for the city of  Manila.  In that court they presented a demurrer to the complaint. The decision sustaining the demurrer is  as  follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"En el articulo 5 de  la Ordenanza No. 2  se usan  las palabras faro y ruleta que no se usan en los otros parrafos de la ordenanza y de esta circunstancia se deduce que la Junta Municipal no ha querido hacer aplicable a los jugadores un principio tan general como en lo referente a  las personas mencionadas en, los cuatro parrafos anteriores.</p>
  <p>"Opino que el juego que se prohibe en el articulo 5 debe de ser de la misma indole de la ruleta o faro y no constando de la querella que el panguingue de Chino lo  os, se estima el demurrer."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this order the Government appealed to this court.</p>
<p>The right of the Government to  appeal from an  order sustaining a demurrer to the complaint has been sustained by this court in the case of the United States <em>vs</em>. Ballentine<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">(1)</sup> (4 Off. Gaz., 722), August 17, 1903.</p>
<p>This right is based on section 44 of General Orders, No. 58, which is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Either party may appeal from a final judgment or from an order made after  judgment affecting  the substantial rights of the appellant or in any case now permitted  by law.  The United States may also appeal from a judgment for the defendant rendered on a demurrer to an information or complaint, and from an order dismissing a complaint or information."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In cases  commenced in the Court of First  Instance,  as was the case of the United States <em>vs</em>. Ballentine, this section secures that right, but as to  cases commenced in the court of the justice of the peace or in the municipal court of the city of Manila the section is  limited and restricted by the provisions of section 43 of the same general orders, which is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"From all final judgments of the Courts of First Instance or courts of similar jurisdiction, and in all cases in which the law now provides  for appeals  from  said courts,  an appeal may be taken to the Supreme Court as hereinafter prescribed.  Appeals shall also  lie from the final  judgments of justices of the peace in criminal cases to the courts of the next superior grade, and the decisions of the latter thereon shall be final and conclusive except in  cases involving the validity or  constitutionality  of  a statute, wherein appeal may be made to the Supreme Court."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this case no question is raised as to the validity or constitutionality  of  the ordinance in  question.  No such question being raised, this court has no jurisdiction over the appeal.  (See Trinidad <em>vs</em>. Sweeney,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> No. 2487, 3 Off. Gaz., 603, and Legaspi<em> vs</em>. Sweeney,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 4  Off. Gaz., 522.)</p>
<p>The appeal is dismissed  with the costs  <em>de  oficio.</em></p>
<p>After  the expiration of. ten days from  the date of final judgment let the  case be remanded to  the court below for proper action.   So ordered.</p>
<em>Arellano,  C. J., Torres, Mapa, Carson,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
