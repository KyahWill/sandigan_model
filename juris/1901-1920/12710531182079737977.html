				<H3>THE UNITED  STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE,  VS.  JACINTA MATA ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.

				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The evidence&nbsp; of record conclusively establishes the performance of the ceremony of marriage between the defendant, Jacinta Mata, and&nbsp; the complaining&nbsp; witness,&nbsp; Marcial Tanedo Tiu Chiu, and leaves no&nbsp; room&nbsp; for doubt of the existence of the alleged carnal relations between this woman and the codefendant, Quiterio Sarmiento.&nbsp; The&nbsp; judgment of the trial court convicting them of the crime of adultery must, therefore, be affirmed, unless it be held, as contended by counsel for the defendants, that the evidence also shows that the&nbsp; marriage&nbsp; between the complaining witness and Jacinta Mata&nbsp; was bigamous, and that&nbsp; in view of this&nbsp; fact, the carnal relations between the defendants should not be adjudged to have constituted&nbsp; the crime of adultery.<br><br>There is evidence in the&nbsp; record which undoubtedly tends very&nbsp; strongly&nbsp; to establish&nbsp; the contention of&nbsp; counsel for defendants&nbsp; that&nbsp; at the time when the complaining&nbsp; witness married the defendant,&nbsp; Jacinta Mata, he had&nbsp; a wife in China; but we do not deem it necessary to make an&nbsp; express finding in&nbsp; this regard,&nbsp; because we are of opinion that&nbsp; in the absence of proof of a formal judicial decree declaring the nullity of&nbsp; the&nbsp; second alleged bigamous marriage the acts complained of constitute the&nbsp; crime of adultery.<br><br>Article 433 of the Penal Code, defining&nbsp; and penalizing the crime of adultery, is as&nbsp; follows:<br><blockquote>"Adultery&nbsp; shall be punished with the penalty of <i>prision correccional</i> in its medium and maximum degrees.<br><br>"Adultery&nbsp; is committed by the married woman who lies with&nbsp; a man&nbsp; not&nbsp; her husband, and by&nbsp; him who lies with her knowing that she&nbsp; is married,&nbsp; although the marriage be afterwards&nbsp; declared void."<br></blockquote>It is quite clear&nbsp; from the peculiar phrasing of the last paragraph of this article, that the lawmakers intended&nbsp; to declare adulterous&nbsp; the&nbsp; infidelity of a married woman&nbsp; to her marital vows, even though it should be made to appear that she is entitled to have&nbsp; her marriage contract declared null and void, until and&nbsp; unless she actually secures a formal judicial declaration to that effect.&nbsp; The reason for this provision is thus stated by Groizard, in his commentary upon similar provisions contained in&nbsp; article 488 of the Spanish Penal&nbsp; Code of 1870:<br><blockquote>"At no time does the bond of matrimony contain a defect which by itself is sufficient to dissolve the&nbsp; union.&nbsp; The marriage must be&nbsp; declared to&nbsp; be&nbsp; null&nbsp; in order that the bond&nbsp; may&nbsp; be severed.&nbsp; "Until&nbsp; it is so declared, until by competent authority in&nbsp; a final judgment the marriage contract&nbsp; is&nbsp; set aside, the offense to the vows taken, and the attack on&nbsp; the family&nbsp; exists - the adultery reunites the essential conditions&nbsp; required for&nbsp; its&nbsp; punishment.&nbsp; This abundantly satisfies the reason and furthermore is expressly set out in our statute."<br></blockquote>Counsel for appellants contends that the provision under consideration is intended merely to&nbsp; declare that, notwithstanding the fact that&nbsp; the&nbsp; marriage is subsequently annulled&nbsp; because of the adulterous conduct of&nbsp; the woman, nevertheless the penalty prescribed by the code is to be imposed&nbsp; and enforced.&nbsp; But the language&nbsp; of the article itself does not justify such a&nbsp; restricted construction, and an examination of the earlier provisions of the Spanish laws upon this subject, from&nbsp; which this article was&nbsp; undoubtedly drawn, disposes of the idea that such could have been the intention of the Spanish lawmaker.&nbsp;&nbsp; Law 81 of Toro, which is law 4,&nbsp; title 28, book&nbsp; 12 of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Novisima Recopilacion, </span>prescribed that it will not serve as an&nbsp; excuse to the adulterers&nbsp; to&nbsp; allege&nbsp; and prove "by divers reasons that the marriage&nbsp; was null on the grounds that the contracting parties were relatives by&nbsp; blood or affinity&nbsp; within the fourth degree,&nbsp; or that either of them&nbsp; was bound by a former&nbsp; marriage,&nbsp; or has taken the vows of chastity, religous vows, or for&nbsp; any&nbsp; other reason whatever, as they ought not to have done that which they had no right to do."<br><br>In the discussion of this case among the members of the court, the question arose&nbsp; whether&nbsp; the provision of&nbsp; article 433&nbsp; under consideration&nbsp; may&nbsp; not&nbsp; have been modified&nbsp; or abrogated by&nbsp; necessary implication by the publication&nbsp; of General Orders, No. 68, December,&nbsp; 1899, whereby "certain provisions respecting marriage" were&nbsp; put in&nbsp; force by&nbsp; the command of the Military Governor during the period&nbsp; of the military occupation of these Islands by the American military forces.<br><br>Section III of that Order is&nbsp; as follows:<br><blockquote>"A subsequent marriage contracted by any person during the life&nbsp; of a former husband or wife of such&nbsp; person, with any person other than the&nbsp; former husband or wife, is illegal and void from the beginning, unless&nbsp; -<br><br>"(1)&nbsp; The former&nbsp; marriage&nbsp; has been&nbsp; annulled or dissolved.<br><br>"(2)&nbsp; Unless such former husband or wife was absent, and&nbsp; not known to&nbsp; such person to&nbsp; be living for the space of seven successive years immediately preceding such&nbsp; subsequent marriage, or&nbsp; was generally reputed and was believed by such&nbsp; person to be dead at the time such&nbsp; subsequent marriage was contracted; in either of which cases the&nbsp; subsequent marriage is&nbsp; valid&nbsp; until&nbsp; its&nbsp; nullity&nbsp; is adjudged by a competent tribunal."</blockquote>Keeping in mind the conditions under which this order was published,&nbsp; and the objects which were&nbsp; sought to&nbsp; be obtained by&nbsp; its provisions, we are of opinion that it was not intended to have the effect,&nbsp; and that it&nbsp; did not have the effect of abrogating those just and humane provisions of the Spanish law which secure to the&nbsp; innocent&nbsp; party to a&nbsp; bigamous&nbsp; marriage certain&nbsp; rights in the communal property&nbsp; acquired&nbsp; during the existence&nbsp; of the&nbsp; bigamous relations, and which legitimate the offspring of such unions and recognize the&nbsp; right of inheritance&nbsp; of such offspring from the offending spouse.&nbsp; The bigamous&nbsp; marriage,&nbsp; as a marriage,&nbsp; is&nbsp; declared to be illegal and void&nbsp; from the beginning, but this provision is not necessarily in conflict with those statutory provisions&nbsp; of the Spanish law which prescribe the status of the children resulting from the bigamous&nbsp; relations&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; party,&nbsp; or the rights of property arising, not as a result of the bigamous marriage but of the communal relations existing thereafter between the parties.<br><br>The gist of the crime of adultery under the Spanish law, as under the common&nbsp; law in&nbsp; force&nbsp; in&nbsp; England&nbsp; and the United States in the absence of&nbsp; statutory enactments,&nbsp; is the danger of introducing spurious heirs into the family, whereby the&nbsp; rights of the real heirs may be impaired and a man may be charged with the maintenance of a family not his own. And&nbsp; since, under&nbsp; Spanish law, legitimate heirs may be begotten of a bigamous marriage, the danger of the introduction&nbsp; of&nbsp; spurious heirs is not less&nbsp; real as a result of the infidelity of the wife of a bigamous marriage than it is in&nbsp; the case of&nbsp; a lawful wife;&nbsp; logically, therefore, the incontinence of the wife of a bigamous marriage, as long as the bigamous relations exist, was&nbsp; deemed by the Spanish legislator to constitute the crime of adultery, and penalized in like manner as&nbsp; is the&nbsp; marital faithlessness of a lawful wife.<br><br>The&nbsp; fact that the law is otherwise&nbsp; in those jurisdictions where legislation has been largely&nbsp; influenced by the doctrines and principles of the common&nbsp; law of England is a natural&nbsp; consequence of the failure of that system of jurisprudence to recognize the existence of heritable blood of the father in&nbsp; the fruits of a bigamous marriage.&nbsp;&nbsp; But it would seem in those States where such children are, by-statute, legitimized, a&nbsp; consistent system of penal legislation would&nbsp; demand the penalization of the incontinence of the wife of a bigamous marriage equally with that of a lawful&nbsp; wife.&nbsp; Certainly, in this jurisdiction, a statute declaring bigamous marriages illegal and void from the beginning ought&nbsp; not to&nbsp; be held to&nbsp; repeal by necessary&nbsp; implication the provisions of the&nbsp; Penal Code penalizing as adulterous the incontinence of the wife of a bigamous marriage unless it be held further&nbsp; to&nbsp; repeal by necessary implication the statutes legitimizing the offspring of bigamous&nbsp; marriages; and as we have said no such effect&nbsp; can or should be given to the&nbsp; General Order under consideration.<br><br>We conclude, therefore,&nbsp; that the&nbsp; provisions&nbsp; of the&nbsp; code penalizing as adultery the infidelity of the wife of a bigamous marriage continue in full force and effect.<br><br>We find no error in the&nbsp; proceedings of the court below prejudicial to the rights of the appellants, and the judgment convicting them&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; crime&nbsp; of&nbsp; adultery and&nbsp; the sentence imposed upon&nbsp; them by the trial court should therefore be affirmed.<br><br><i> Arellano, C. J., Mapa, Moreland,</i> and <i>Trent, JJ.</i>, concur.<br></div>
