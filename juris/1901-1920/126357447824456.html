				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Juan Banatin  died on  the 23d  of April, 1897,  leaving surviving him  his widow the plaintiff, to whom  he had been married fourteen years, and as his only heirs at law seventeen nephews and nieces.   On the 13th of June,  1897, the widow and the nephews and nieces made a partition among themselves of ail the property left by the deceased. This partition appears by a written instrument signed by the parties thereto.  By the terms of that instrument it was agreed that the house which is in question  in  this suit, situated in Calamba in the Province of La Laguna, should remain undivided and that  the defendant,  Francisco Salgado, who was one of the nephews, should  administer the property,  collecting the rents thereof, and should divide the same,  paying one half to the widow and the other half to the nephews and nieces.  In the document itself it is stated that the defendant accepted the administration of the house and  thereby assumed charge thereof.  He has since that time collected the rents but, instead of  paying one-half of the same to the plaintiff, has paid all thereof to the nephews  and nieces.  This action is brought  by the plaintiff to recover one-half of the rents from the date of the agreement to the present time.</p>
<p>The principal defense set up is that the contract of partition was void because it was not signed by  all the  parties interested in  the  estate, and evidence  was introduced to show that one of  the persons whose name appears to  have been signed thereto; Juan Banaybanay, was a prisoner in Manila at the time it was executed.   It was proved that another one of the nephews,  Tranquilino Banatin, refused to sign the agreement.  To  the document of partition is annexed a paper  stating this fact  and stating that  the other heirs had agreed that the part which  belonged  to Tranquilino should be delivered to another one of the heirs, Procopio Pabalan, for Tranquilino,  Not  only was  the original document of partition  signed by the defendant, but this second document was also signed by  him.</p>
<p>In view of these facts we do not think that the failure of Tranquilino Banatin to sign the agreement of partition, or the fact that Juan Banaybanay did  not do so, can relieve the defendant  of the obligation which he voluntarily assumed thereunder.  There is no doubt that he took possession of the property by virtue of this agreement of partition and he did so knowing that one, at least, of the parties had not signed  the same.  Having voluntarily assumed the obligation to collect the rents and pay one-half thereof to the widow, he  can not now.  say that he is  not bound by that obligation.  He would  have no right  to retain the rents in his own hands and refuse to pay them to anyone on the ground  that two of the parties had not signed the partition.  He  was under no obligation to assume this duty. When he knew  that one of the heirs was not a  party to the partition, he should have refused to assume charge of the property if he  did not wish to be bound by the agreements therein stated.   But  having assumed such  charge,  he  is bound to comply with the duty  imposed upon him by the contract.</p>
<p>It is  to be observed, moreover, that in the absence of. any partition whatever, he would be legally bound to pay the plaintiff one-half of the rents received from this  property.  Article 837 of the Civil Code is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"If the testator  should leave neither legitimate ascendants nor descendants, the surviving spouse shall be entitled to one-half of the estate also in usufruct."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The case at  bar falls directly within the provisions of this article.</p>
<p>The judgment of the court below is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.</p>
<p>After the  expiration  of  twenty days  let judgment be entered in accordance herewith, and ten days thereafter let the case bo remanded to the court below for proper action. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Carson, </em>and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em>Johnson, J.,</em> did not sit in this case.<br>
