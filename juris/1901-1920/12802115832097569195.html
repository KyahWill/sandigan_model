				<BR><STRONG>MORELAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The defendant in this case was tried under the following information:<br><blockquote>"The undersigned accuses Juan Pilares of the crime of <span style="font-style: italic;">lesiones graves</span> committed as follows:<br><br>"That on or about the 5th day of June, 1908, in the municipality&nbsp; of Meycauayan,&nbsp; Province&nbsp; of Bulacan,&nbsp; P. I., the said accused, voluntarily, illegally and criminally assaulted, beat and struck Severino&nbsp; Manzano in the&nbsp; breast and in other parts of the body, in&nbsp; his&nbsp; own house, causing injuries to the left knee and&nbsp; contusions in the chest of the&nbsp; said Severino&nbsp; Manzano; furthermore producing injuries to the internal organs, fever and&nbsp; spitting of blood which required more than thirty days to be cured with&nbsp; medical attention during all that time; that&nbsp; by reason of&nbsp; these injuries and sickness,&nbsp; the said Severino Manzano&nbsp; suffered damages in the sum of P481.10.&nbsp; All contrary to the law."</blockquote>The defendant demurred&nbsp; to the&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the ground that "from the provisions of the Penal Code, articles 414 to 418, which define the crime of <i>lesiones</i>, it is required that for&nbsp; the&nbsp; existence of that crime it is necessary that the <i>lesiones </i>occasion to the injured party mutilation, imbecility, impotency,&nbsp; perpetual inability to work,&nbsp; incapacity for the same for a certain period of&nbsp; time, sickness or necessity of medical attention;"&nbsp; further saying that the complaint does not&nbsp; express any of these effects.&nbsp; The demurrer was&nbsp; overruled&nbsp; and&nbsp; the cause&nbsp; proceeded to trial on the&nbsp; information&nbsp; above quoted.<br><br>We are of the opinion that&nbsp; the information&nbsp; was good. It asserts all of the facts required in the allegation of the crime of <i>lesiones graves</i>.&nbsp; Article 416,&nbsp; subdivision 4, of the Penal Code, penalizes <i>lesiones graves</i> as follows:<br><blockquote>"With that of <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span> in its maximum "degree to <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correccional</span>&nbsp; in its minimum degree, if such injuries should have occasioned&nbsp; the assaulted party&nbsp; illness or&nbsp; disability for work lasting&nbsp; more than thirty days."</blockquote>It will&nbsp; be observed that to&nbsp; make&nbsp; the&nbsp; information good it is not necessary to allege illness and disability for work.<br><br>Matea Lim Icoy, the wife of&nbsp; Severino Manzano, testified that she&nbsp; was&nbsp; awakened from&nbsp; her sleep&nbsp; by&nbsp; the voice&nbsp; of her husband&nbsp; saying "Trining, Trining,&nbsp; they are killing me," and&nbsp; the noise produced by the falling of coins on the floor of the house;&nbsp; that she saw&nbsp; the&nbsp; accused strike&nbsp; her husband with his&nbsp; fist, seize him with both hands and drag him to the store&nbsp; and when&nbsp; there kick&nbsp; him in the chest, felling him to the&nbsp; floor; that afterwards the accused struck her; that, after her husband&nbsp; had regained his&nbsp; feet,&nbsp; the accused struck&nbsp; him&nbsp; again and he was&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; point&nbsp; of falling when&nbsp; she supported him,&nbsp; assisting&nbsp; him&nbsp; into&nbsp; the house; that at that&nbsp; moment Lorenzo del Rosario arrived and sought to&nbsp; pacify the accused, but the latter&nbsp; suddenly seized her husband&nbsp; by the hands&nbsp; and sought to&nbsp; pull him forth; that&nbsp; she grasped her husband by the&nbsp; waist,&nbsp; and as the accused was not able to&nbsp; drag hint loose from her, he gave her husband a kick in&nbsp; the side which&nbsp; felled him to the floor,&nbsp; and&nbsp; then&nbsp; she&nbsp; ordered the servants to call the police; that a policeman came immediately, followed by the chief of police, who, after inquiring into what had occurred, took&nbsp; the accused to the presidencies; that afterwards she saw contusions on the right and&nbsp; left side of the body of her husband and on&nbsp; the chest and on the face;&nbsp; that she also saw blood upon the left leg;&nbsp; that two doctors treated her husband; that from the day he was injured he was unable to work up to the time of his&nbsp; death.<br><br>The testimony&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; wife of the&nbsp; deceased&nbsp; was&nbsp; corroborated by that of her daughter, Trinidad Manzano, and by that of Lorenzo del Pilar.&nbsp; The latter testified that he saw Juan&nbsp; Pilares in the store of Severino Manzano and heard the&nbsp; latter say to him&nbsp; "you are a teacher, without respect," or "you do not know how to&nbsp; show respect, nor do you show politeness;" that after these expressions the accused turned, facing Manzano, and struck him&nbsp; with his fist in the face; that Manzano fell into the arms of his wife, who finally succeeded&nbsp; in getting him into&nbsp; the house; that thereupon the witness tried to make peace between them; that he spoke first to the accused and advised him to leave; that he then went to the&nbsp; door of the store&nbsp; and advised the Chinaman&nbsp; to keep quiet; that thereafter the accused went&nbsp; up to the railing of the store, seized the Chinaman, and tried to pull him&nbsp; out; that he was unable to do so because the wife of the Chinaman clung to him; that thereupon&nbsp; the accused struck her a blow in the face, whereupon they separated.<br><br>It was proved by the testimony oi the&nbsp; physicians who attended Manzano that he&nbsp; was injured to such an extent that he required medical attention for more than thirty days.<br><br>We are convinced after a&nbsp; careful&nbsp; reading of the testimony adduced on the trial that the learned trial court properly appreciated the situation.&nbsp;&nbsp; The testimony produced by the prosecution is amply sufficient to support the judgment of conviction.&nbsp;&nbsp; We do not believe that&nbsp; the testimony introduced by the accused&nbsp; has cast a doubt upon the righteousness of his conviction.<br><br>In imposing sentence upon the accused the learned trial court took into consideration the extenuating circumstances of <span style="font-style: italic;">arrebato y obcecacion</span>.&nbsp; We are of the opinion that the facts proved are&nbsp; not sufficient to warrant&nbsp; that&nbsp; finding. Manzano offered no provocation sufficient to justify the accused in the repeated attacks which he made upon him.&nbsp; In order that&nbsp; the extenuating circumstance above-mentioned should exist,&nbsp; there must be facts proved showing provocation sufficient to produce&nbsp; such a condition of&nbsp; mind.&nbsp; No such facts have been proved here, and the finding that such a state of mind&nbsp; existed in the accused is without&nbsp; proof sufficient to support it.<br><br>Accordingly the&nbsp; sentence&nbsp; of the court&nbsp; below, imposed under his judgment of conviction, is hereby modified, and the defendant is sentenced to one year and&nbsp; eight months of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correctional</span>, and, as modified, the&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; is affirmed.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson,</span> and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Trent, JJ.,</span> concur.</div>
