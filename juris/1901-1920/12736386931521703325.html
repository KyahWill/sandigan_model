				<H3>AGATON SIBAL, PETITIONER, VS. THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF TARLAC AND ALBERTO PUNSALAN, RESPONDENTS.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>TRENT, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div aling="justify">At the general election held on June 6, 1916, in the municipality of
Bamban, Province of. Tarlac, there were forty-five votes cast for
Agaton Sibal and forty-three for AlbertoPunsalan. The municipal board
of canvassers proclaimed the former duly elected president of that
municipality. Punsalan filed his motion in the Court of First Instance
contesting the election. Judgment was entered directing the municipal
board of canvassers to correct the returns by eliminating all the votes
cast for Agaton Sibal and to proclaim Punsalan elected. Subsequent
thereto, and on October 13, 1916, Sibal instituted the present action
in this court, praying that a writ of certiorari issue to the judge of
the Court of First Instance of the Province of Tarlac directing him to
certify to this court a transcript of the record of the proceedings had
in the election contest, and that after hearing, the above mentioned
order be set aside as being in excess of jurisdiction.
<p>From the decision of the trial court, which is made apart of the
petition, it appears, and the court so found after an examination of
the oral testimony presented, that there were two qualified electors in
the municipality of Bamban by the name of Agaton Sibal; that both of
those men voted at the election; that on examining the ballots there
were forty-five containing the names of Agaton Sibal as having been
voted for for municipal president and forty-three for Alberto Punsalan;
that the election inspectors gave all of the forty-five votes to the
younger of the two Sibals, who was generally known in the municipality
by the name of Agaton Sibal 2; that on the forty-five ballots there was
no way of distinguishing for which of the two Sibals they were cast;
and that oral testimony was presented which tended to show that both of
the Sibals were candidates forthe office of municipal president. The
court thereupon found that the allegations in the contestant's motion
had<br>
been established and rendered judgment accordingly.</p>
<p>It will thus be seen that an important question of fact was
presented to the trial court and decided by it. The judgment complained
of rests upon that question. It is<br> now urged that the court erred
in its finding of fact to the effect that both of the Sibals were
candidates for the office of municipal president and we are asked to
review the testimony presented and make a different finding of facts.
This cannot be done by means of certiorari for the reason that the
court had jurisdiction to determine that question. It being true, as
found by the trial court, that both of the Sibals and Punsalan were
candidates for the same office, it was impossible to determine how many
ofthe forty-five votes cast for Agaton Sibal were intended for the
older and how many were intended for the younger of the two. Where the
jurisdiction of the court depends upon the determination of a question
of fact and that question has been determined by the court after
hearing such determination is conclusive and cannot be attacked
collaterally. (Navarro vs. Jimenez, 23 Phil. Rep., 557.)</p>
<p>Let judgment be entered dismissing the petition, with costs against the petitioner, Agaton Sibal. So ordered.</p>
<em>Torres, Carson</em>, and <em>Araullo, JJ.</em>, concur.
<br>
<br><br>
<hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<p>Moreland, J., concurring and dissenting:</p>
<p>I agree to the dismissal of the petition on the merits. But I do not
agree to the ground on which the dismissal is based, namely, that:
"Where the jurisdiction of the court depends upon the determination of
a question of fact and that question has been determined by the court
after hearing, such determination is conclusive and cannot be attacked
collaterally." No such question is involved in this case, in my
judgment.</p>
<p>The court had jurisdiction of the proceeding as a matter of law and
it exercised that jurisdiction within the limits set by the law. That
being so certiorari will not lie.</p>
