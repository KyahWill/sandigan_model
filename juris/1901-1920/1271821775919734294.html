that these latter also died; the first named was the father of the plaintiff; the second was the father of the defendant Eustaquio Salvacion; and the last named was the mother of the other defendant, Andres Salting; that the said lands are now in the possession of the defendants and have not been divided among the heirs, as the plaintiff, notwithstanding the extrajudicial actions taken by him, has been unable to obtain the apportionment of the same, for which reason he prays the court below to enter judgment ordering that the lands in question be divided into equal parts between the plaintiff and the defendants, and that the latter be sentenced to pay the costs and damages.<br><br>The representative of the defendant Eustaquio Salvacion, in answer to the foregoing complaint, denied the first allegation as being false, and set forth that the said lands had already been apportioned during the lifetime of the children, Lazaro, Evaristo, and Dorotea Salvacion, that each of them had received his share to which the plaintiff and the defendants had particularly succeeded as the respective children of the above-named brothers.&nbsp; As a special defense he alleged that the question of the ownership of the lands possessed by Eustaquio Salvacion had already been ventilated in a civil action before the same court, the same David Salvacion being the plaintiff therein; the suit was decided in favor of the former, who afterwards, out of affection and regard for the said plaintiff, made him a present of one of the parcels of land in question, which David Salvacion received and of which he is now in possession; for said reason he asked that judgment with costs be entered against the plaintiff.<br><br>According to a telegraphic communication of the 5th of January, 1906, addressed to the clerk of the court by Silvestre Arzadon, Andres Salvacion was unable to appear before the court for the reason that he was seriously ill, and he conformed to the petition&nbsp; of the plaintiff.<br><br>The case was tried and evidence was adduced by the parties; the trial judge in view of the evidence adduced and of the documents that were made of record, entered judgment on the 20th of February, 1907, absolving the defendants Eustaquio Salvacion and Andres Salting of the complaint, without any special ruling as to costs.<br><br>The plaintiff excepted to the above decision and moved for a new trial on the ground that the evidence did not justify the decision and that said decision was contrary to law.&nbsp; The motion was overruled, whereupon the petitioner at once gave notice of his intention to appeal by means of the corresponding bill of exceptions.&nbsp; The court below, while overruling the motion, admitted the statement of the plaintiff and directed the clerk of the court to enter the same in the corresponding register, and the bill of exceptions, together with&nbsp; the record of the case, was submitted to this court.&nbsp; By an order of May 25, 1907, the appellant was authorized to appeal to this court as a pauper in accordance with the provisions of Act No. 1123 of the Philippine Commission.<br><br>It is an established rule of this court, in consonance with the provisions of section 497, paragraph 3, of the Code of Civil Procedure, as amended by Act No. 1596, that, where a motion for a new trial is overruled by a lower court, and no exception is taken to the overruling, the Supreme Court has no authority to review the evidence, and, admitting the facts held to be proven, it shall limit its jurisdiction to the questions of law.&nbsp; (Decision in case&nbsp; No. 4,100, among others, Singayan <i>vs</i>. Mabborang, 10 Phil. Rep., 601.)<br><br>It appears from the bill of exceptions submitted by the appellant that he did not except to the order of the court below of the 30th of March, 1907, by which his motion for the reopening of the case and the holding of a new trial was denied; for said reason, in accordance with the law and the established rules, we are not permitted to review the evidence in the present case, and this court of appeal, after admitting the facts established by the court below in its judgment and the conclusions therein contained, will limit its jurisdiction to reviewing and deciding such questions of law as may have arisen between the contending parties.<br><br>It is held in the judgment appealed&nbsp; from that it has been proven that a partition had already been made of the property belonging to the inheritance of the grandparents of the plaintiff and the defendant, between the parents of the same, and among the said property appears the greater part of the lands now claimed; and that the lands referred to in some of the documents produced by the defendant did not come from the said inheritance and that they were acquired by the latter; therefore, the plaintiff has no right to claim a participation in them.<br><br>As to the fact alleged that the partition as made was unequal, and that the lands already apportioned were again taken possession of by the defendant, the judgment states that a different action should be brought, and not one for the partition of the property already distributed.<br><br>We consider that the judgment appealed from is in accordance with the facts and the merits of the case.<br><br>It should be&nbsp; noted that, under article 406 of the Civil Code, the&nbsp; rules relating to the division of an estate shall be applicable to division among the coowners.<br><br>The special remedy authorized by sections 181 et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure can only be availed of by the person who is a coowner of real estate possessed in common and undivided; without these requisites no action can be brought by a person who is not entitled to real estate owned exclusively by a third party without the characteristics of joint ownership and undivided interest mentioned.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, it is our&nbsp; opinion that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed, and we do hereby affirm it with the costs against the appellant.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J., Mapa, Johnson, Carson</i>, and <i>Willard, JJ</i>., concur. </div><br>
