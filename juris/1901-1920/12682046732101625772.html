				G.R. No. 9916, October 30, 1914</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. CHIEN SUEY, DEFENDANT AND, APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MORELAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of the 
Department of Mindanao and Sulu convicting the accused of a violation of section 
31 of the Opium Law and sentencing him to pay a fine of P1,000, with subsidiary 
imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the costs of the trial.
<p>The information alleges: "On or about the 17th day of October, 1913, in the 
municipality of Jolo, district of Sulu, Department of Mindanao and Sulu, P. I., 
the aforesaid accused Chinaman, Chien Suey, did then and there willfully, 
knowingly, criminally, and illegally have in his possession and under his 
control 10 cans of opium, without being duly authorized to have the same in his 
possession."</p>
<p>The opium alleged to have been found in the possession of the defendant was 
not produced in court and no one testified to the fact that it was opium except 
an ignorant Moro woman, who apparently knew nothing about opium.</p>
<p>It further appears in the case that the witnesses for the prosecution were 
enemies of the accused, and that fact, taken in connection with the further fact 
that their testimony is not altogether reasonable and, in part, contradictory, 
makes it impossible for us to concur in the finding of the learned trial court 
that the accused was proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>It hot having been shown beyond a reasonable question that the substance 
alleged to be opium was such, and the only other evidence tending to incriminate 
the accused being given by persons who entertained strong feelings against him 
and whose testimony was, to say the least, in part unreasonable, we are 
constrained to reverse the judgment and to acquit the accused.</p>
<p>The judgment of conviction is reversed and the accused acquitted. Costs 
<em>de officio.</em></p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson, Carson, Trent,</em> and <em>Araullo, 
JJ.,</em> concur.<br><br></p></div>
