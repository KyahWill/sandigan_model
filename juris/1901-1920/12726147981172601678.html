				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>FISHER, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment in favor of plaintiff in an action of 
ejectment. Defendants excepted, moved unsuccessfully for a new trial, excepted 
to the order denying their motion, and removed the cause to this court by bill 
of exceptions.
<p>It is averred in the amended complaint that plaintiff is the owner of the 
land here in question, and that he has been unlawfully deprived of its 
possession by defendant. These averments are denied by the answer and it is 
alleged on behalf of the defendant Liongson that he is the lawful owner of the 
land, and that the title upon which plaintiff relies was obtained by deceit and 
in fraud of the true owner of the property.</p>
<p>As proof of his title to the land here in dispute plaintiff offered in 
evidence a certificate of title issued by the register of deeds of the Province 
of Tarlac pursuant to section 122 of the Land Registration Act and chapter one 
of Act No. 926, and the acts supplemental thereto, governing the homesteading of 
portions of the public domain, from which it appears that on the 23d day of 
August, 1913, the Governor-General of the Philippine Islands granted to 
plaintiff a homestead patent to the tract of land described in his complaint. It 
was admitted in open court that plaintiff's witnesses would testify that the 
defendants took possession of the land in question in May, 1915, and continue to 
be in possession thereof; and that the annual revenue from the land is P250.</p>
<p>Plaintiff then rested. Defendants offered in evidence a registered possessory 
information, issued in 1895 to one Juan Ysais, and which, it is contended by 
defendant, included in the larger tract therein described, the land described in 
plaintiff's homestead patent. They also offered documentary proof tending to 
show that the rights of Ysais to the land had been conveyed to them. Defendants 
then sought to prove by the testimony of witnesses that plaintiff had been in 
possession of the land during the proceedings leading up to the grant of the 
homestead patent as a mere tenant of defendants' grantors, and had obtained the 
patent surreptitiously and in fraud of defendants' grantors. This evidence was 
rejected by the trial court upon the ground that the certificate of title was 
conclusive proof of the ownership of the land and that no evidence, oral or 
documentary, tending to show title in any other person than the registered owner 
was admissible.</p>
<p>It will be noted that one of the averments of the special defense set up by 
the answer is that the title upon which plaintiff relies was obtained by deceit, 
in fraud of the true owner of the land. The case, therefore, squarely presents 
the issue as to whether such a certificate of title as that upon which plaintiff 
relies is as incontestable as are those based upon decrees of the Court of Land 
Registration or of the Courts of First Instance rendered in land registration 
cases.</p>
<p>It is settled conclusively in this jurisdiction that the titles issued by 
virtue of final decrees of the Court of Land Registration or of the Courts of 
First Instance in accordance with the provisions of the Land Registration Act 
(Act No. 496) are conclusive and binding upon all the world. But the proceedings 
by which the title to land is determined in the courts under that act are 
<em>judicial</em>. Process is served by publication upon all persons who may 
have an interest in the land, and they are given an opportunity to appear and 
oppose the petition for registration if they desire to do so. The action is one 
<em>in rem</em>, and the court acquires jurisdiction over the <em>res</em> by 
the service of its process in the manner prescribed by the statute. (Tyler 
<em>vs</em>. Court of Registration, 175 Mass., 71; City of Manila <em>vs</em>. 
Lack, 19 Phil. Rep., 324; Grey Alba <em>vs</em>. De la Cruz, 17 Phil. Rep., 49; 
Legarda and Prieto <em>vs</em>. Saleeby, 31 Phil. Rep., 590; American Land Co. 
<em>vs</em>. Zeiss, 219 U. S., 47.)</p>
<p>The proceedings by which titles to portions of the public domain are granted 
to homesteaders in accordance with the provisions of the Public Land Act, on the 
contrary, are purely administrative.</p>
<p>Assuming that the statements of the applicant for a homestead are false and 
that the land to which he is endeavoring to obtain title is not in fact 
unoccupied public land, but is the private property of some other person, are 
the rights of the lawful owner of the land divested by the issuance and 
registration of the patent if he fails to appear before the Director of Lands to 
contest the issuance of the patent?</p>
<p>The provisions of the Public Land Act which pertain to the matter now under 
consideration are to be found in sections 2, 3, 5, 7 and 8. Section 2 requires 
the Director of Lands, upon receipt of a homestead application to "Summarily 
determine, by inquiry of the Chief of the Bureau of Forestry, and from the 
available land records, whether the land described is <em>prima facie</em> 
subject under the law to homestead settlement, and if he shall find nothing to 
the contrary, the applicant * * * shall be permitted to enter the quantity of 
land specified." Section 3 provides that in not less than five nor more than 
eight years from the date of the filing of the application the applicant may 
make proof, by two credible witnesses, that he has resided upon and cultivated 
the land for the term of five years immediately succeeding the application. 
Section 5 authorizes and requires the Director of Lands to cancel the homestead 
entry if it is made to appear to him, upon notice to the homesteader, that "the 
land entered is not under the law subject to homestead entry * * * and the land 
thereupon shall become subject to disposition as other public lands of like 
character." Sections 7 and 8 are as follows:</p>
<p>"Sec. 7. Before final proof shall be submitted by any person claiming to have 
complied with the provisions of this chapter, due notice, as prescribed by the 
Chief of the Bureau of Public Lands, with the approval of the Secretary of the 
Interior, shall be given to the public of his intention to make such proof, 
stating therein the time and place, and giving a description of the land and the 
names of the witnesses by whom it is expected that the necessary facts will be 
established.</p>
<p>"Sec. 8. Any person may file an affidavit of contest against any homestead 
entry, charging that the land entered was not unoccupied, unreserved, or 
unappropriated agricultural land at the time of filing the application, alleging 
disqualification of the entryman, noncompliance with law as to residence or 
cultivation, or any other matter which, if proven, would be just cause for the 
cancellation of the entry, and upon successful termination of the contest, the 
contestant, if a qualified entryman, shall be allowed a preference right of 
entry for sixty days from said date.</p>
<p>"The Chief of the Bureau of Public Lands or any public official becoming 
aware of the existence of any of the grounds above stated, for impeaching or 
canceling the entry, may file formal complaint against the entry on any such 
ground which, if proven, shall cause the cancellation of the entry."</p>
<p>It will be observed that, while provision is made for notice to the public of 
the intention of the homesteader to apply for a patent upon final proof of 
occupation and cultivation of the land, and for the hearing of objections to the 
application upon various grounds, including the contention that the land in 
question was not "unoccupied" at the time of filing the application, the statute 
nowhere undertakes to declare that the decision of the Director upon such 
contest shall be conclusive, or that the failure of the real owner to contest 
the application shall have the effect of forfeiting his title by making the 
director's decision as to the public character of the land final and conclusive. 
The provisions of the Public Land Act (Act No. 926) in this respect are similar 
to those by which title to the public domain in the United States is granted to 
settlers. But it has never been held that the proceedings in the United States 
Land Office which lead up to the issuance of a patent have the effect of 
divesting prior valid titles. On the contrary, it has been expressly decided 
that they have no such effect. In the case of Best <em>vs</em>. Polk (85 U. S., 
112 at p. 117), the Supreme Court of the United States said:</p>
<p>"It has been repeatedly held by this court that a patent is void which 
attempts to convey lands that have been 'previously granted, reserved from sale, 
or appropriated.' (Stoddard <em>vs</em>. Chambers, 2 How., 284; U. S. 
<em>vs</em>. Arredondo, 6 Pet, 728; Reichart <em>vs</em>. Felps, 6 Wall., 160; 
73 U. S., XVIII, 849.) 'It would be a dangerous doctrine (says the court in New 
Orleans <em>vs</em>. U. S., 10 Pet., 731) to consider the issuing of a grant as 
conclusive evidence of right in the power which issued it. On its face it is 
conclusive, and cannot be controverted; but, if the thing granted was not in the 
grantor, no right passes to the grantee. A grant has been frequently issued by 
the United States for land which had been previously granted, and the second 
grant has been held to be inoperative.'"</p>
<p>In the case of Northern Pac. R. Co. <em>vs</em>. McCormick (72 Fed. Rep., 
736), the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit said:</p>
<p>"The decisions in the land department in contested cases are conclusive only 
as to matters of fact which come within their jurisdiction, and a patent is not 
evidence of title to land which was not subject to disposition by the United 
States. (Barden <em>vs</em>. Railroad Co., 154 U. S., 327; 14 Sup. Ct, 1030; 
Best <em>vs</em>. Polk, 18 Wall., 112; Morton vs. Nebraska, 21 Wall., 660; 
Sherman <em>vs</em>. Buick, 93 U. S., 209; Wright <em>vs</em>. Roseberry, 121 U. 
S., 488; 7 Sup. Ct, 985; Mining Co. <em>vs</em>. Campbell, 135 U. S., 286; 10 
Sup. Ct., 765.)"</p>
<p>The same opinion is again clearly enunciated in the recent cases of Wright 
<em>vs</em>. Roseberry (121 U. S., 488, 519), and Davis <em>vs</em>. Wiebbold 
(139 U. S., 507, 529). In Wright <em>vs</em>. Roseberry, <em>supra</em>, the 
court said:</p>
<p>"The doctrine that all presumptions are to be indulged in support of 
proceedings upon which a patent is issued, and which is not open to collateral 
attack in an action of ejectment, has no application where it is shown that the 
land in controversy had, before the initiation of the proceedings upon which the 
patent was issued, passed from the United States. The previous transfer is a 
fact which may be established in an action at law as well as in a suit in 
equity. As we said in Smelting Co. vs. Kempt (104 U. S., 641 [26; 876]) ; 'When 
we speak of the conclusive presumptions attending a patent for lands, we assume 
that it was issued in a ease where the department had jurisdiction to act and 
execute it; that is to say, in a case where the lands belonged to the United 
States and provision had been made by law for their sale. If they never were 
public property, or had previously been disposed of, or if Congress had made no 
provision for their sale, or had reserved them, the department would have no 
jurisdiction to transfer them, and its attempted conveyance of them would be 
inoperative and void, no matrter with what seeming regularity the forms of law 
may have been observed. The action of the department would, in that event, be 
like that of any other special tribunal not having jurisdiction of a case which 
it had assumed to decide. Matters of this kind, disclosing a want of 
jurisdiction, may be considered by a court of law. In such cases the objection 
to the patent reaches beyond the action of the special tribunal, and goes to the 
existence of a subject upon which it was competent to act.'</p>
<p>"And again, in the same case, we said (p. 646) : 'A patent may be 
collaterally impeached in any action, and its operation as a conveyance 
defeated, by showing that the department had no jurisdiction to dispose of the 
lands; that is, that the law did not provide for selling them, or that they had 
been reserved from sale or dedicated to special purposes, or had been previously 
transferred to others. In establishing any of these particulars the judgment of 
the department upon matters properly before it is not assailed, nor is the 
regularity of its proceedings called into question; but its authority to act at 
all is denied, and shown never to have existed.'</p>
<p>" 'There are cases,' said Chief Justice Marshall, 'in which a grant is 
absolutely void; as when the State has no title to the thing granted, or when 
the officer had no authority to issue the grant. In such cases the validity of 
the grant is necessarily examinable at law.' (Polk's Lessee <em>vs</em>. Wendal, 
13 U. S., 85; 9 Cranch, 87, 99 [3; 665, 669]). Indeed, it may be said to be 
common knowledge that patents of the United States for lands which they had 
previously granted, reserved for sale, or appropriated are void. (Easton 
<em>vs</em>. Salisbury, 62 U. S., 426; 21 How,, 426 [16; 181]; Reichert 
<em>vs</em>. Felps, 73 U. S., 160-166; Wall., 160 [18; 849]; Best <em>vs</em>. 
Polk, 85 U. S., 112-120; 18 Wall., 112 [21; 805]). It would be a most 
extraordinary doctrine if the holder of a conveyance of land from a State were 
precluded from establishing his title simply because the United States may have 
subsequently conveyed the land to another, and especially from showing that 
years before they had granted the property to the State, and thus were without 
title at the time of their subsequent conveyance. As this court said in New 
Orleans <em>vs</em>. United States (10 Pet., 663, 731): 'It would be a dangerous 
doctrine to consider the issuing of a grant as conclusive evidence of right in 
the power which issued it. On its face it is conclusive, and cannot be 
controverted; but if the thing granted was not in the grantor, no right passes 
to the grantee. A grant has been frequently issued by the United States for land 
which had been previously granted, arid the second grant has been held to be 
inoperative.' "</p>
<p>In Davis <em>vs</em>. Wiebbold, <em>supra</em>, the Supreme Court 
emphatically reiterated its former statements of the rule, saying:</p>
<p>"We agree to all that is urged by counsel as to the conclusiveness of the 
patents of the land department when assailed collaterally in actions at law. We 
have had occasion to assert their unassailability in such cases in the strongest 
terms, both in St. Louis Smelting, etc., Co. <em>vs</em>. Kempt (104 U. S., 636, 
640-646), and in Steel <em>vs</em>. St. Louis Smelting, etc., Co. (106 U. S., 
447, 451, 452). They are conclusive in such actions of all matters of fact 
necessary to their issue, where the department had jurisdiction to act upon such 
matters, and to determine them; but if the lands patented were not at the time 
public property, having been previously disposed of, or no provision had been 
made for their sale, or other disposition, or they had been reserved from sale, 
the department had no jurisdiction to transfer the land, and their attempted 
conveyance by patent is inoperative and void, no matter with what seeming 
regularity the forms of law have been observed."</p>
<p>There being nothing in the Public Land Act to indicate that it was the 
purpose of the Legislature to vest the Director of Lands with authority to 
divest valid outstanding private titles by his decision that the land embraced 
within the homestead application is public, and that a patent should issue to 
the patentee, what reasons are there to support the conclusions that a patent 
issued by the Director of Lands here has any greater effect than a patent issued 
by the Land Office in the United States ? As we have seen, it is unquestionable 
that in the United States the patentee gets a good title if the land was really 
part of the public domain, and therefore subject to disposal by the Government, 
but that, on the contrary, if it transpires that the Government had no title to 
the land when the patent was issued, no title passes to the patentee by the 
issuance of the patent. The procedure under our Public Land Law being 
substantially the same as that prescribed by similar statutes in the United 
States, and the purpose being identical, the conclusion is irresistible that the 
grantee of such a patent, up to the time of its execution by the Governor- 
General, is in no better position than is the holder of such a patent in the 
United States, and that if the land to which the patent relates was not in fact 
<em>public</em>, but was the property of a third person, the rights of that 
person have not been divested or affected.</p>
<p>When a patent to public land in the United States is signed on behalf of the 
Government by the official authorized by the statute to do so, it is delivered 
to the patentee, and the legal title to the land, so far as it was subject to 
disposition by the Government, vests in the grantee from the date of the 
execution of the patent, and he is entitled to have the patent delivered to him. 
But the Philippine Public Land Law (sec. 73, Act No. 926; sec. 122, Act No. 496) 
directs that the patent, after execution, shall not be delivered by the 
Governor-General to the patentee, but shall be delivered to the register of 
deeds of the province where the land lies, and section 122 of the Land 
Registration Act (<em>No. 496</em>) makes it the duty of that official to 
register the patent "like other deeds" and to issue to the patentee a duplicate 
certificate of the entry in the register. It is declared that the act of 
registration, not the issuance of the patent, shall be "the operative act to 
convey and affect the land * * *" and that upon the registration of the patent, 
and the issuance of the duplicate certificate of title to the patentee, "such 
land shall be registered land for all purposes under this Act."</p>
<p>The full text of this section of the Land Registration Act is as follows:</p>
<p>"SEC. 122. Whenever public lands in the Philippine Islands belonging" to the 
Government of the United States or to the Government of the Philippine Islands 
are alienated, granted, or conveyed to persons or to public or private 
corporations, the same shall be brought forthwith under the operation of this 
Act and shall become registered lands. It shall be the duty of the official 
issuing the instrument of alienation, grant, or conveyance in behalf of the 
Government to cause such instrument, before its delivery to the grantee, to be 
filed with the register of deeds for the province where the land lies and to be 
there registered like other deeds and conveyances, whereupon a certificate shall 
be entered as in. other cases of registered land, and an owner's duplicate 
certificate issued to the grantee. The deed, grant, or instrument of conveyance 
from the Government to the grantee shall not take effect as a conveyance or bind 
the land, but shall operate only as a contract between the Government and the 
grantee and as evidence of authority Jto the clerk or register of deeds to make 
registration. The act of registration shall be the operative act to convey and 
affect the lands, and in all cases under this Act registration shall be made in 
the office of the register of deeds for the province where the land lies. The 
fees for registration shall be paid by the grantee. After due registration and 
issue of the certificate and owner's duplicate such land shall be registered 
land for all purposes under this Act."</p>
<p>The trial judge was of the opinion, and so held, that the effect of the 
registration of the homestead patent and the issuance of a duplicate certificate 
of title to the patentee was to vest in him an incontestable title to the land, 
precisely as though his ownership had been determined by the final decree of a 
competent court under the Land Registration Act, and that the title so issued is 
absolutely conclusive and indisputable.</p>
<p>We are of the opinion that section 122 of the Land Registration Act is not 
susceptible of this interpretation.</p>
<p>It will be observed that the section under consideration expressly determines 
the <em>class</em> of land to which its operation is limited. This is declared 
to be "public land * * * <em>belonging</em> to the Government * * *."</p>
<p>There is nothing in the section to warrant the conclusion that it was 
intended to apply to private property erroneously included in a government 
patent, as to which the Government has no right at all. The statement in the 
last paragraph of the section that upon the registration of the patent and the 
issuance of the title "such land shall be registered land for all purposes under 
this Act" must be read in the light of the antecedent language. The words 
<em>"such land''</em> are evidently used to refer to the only class of land to 
which the section in terms refers, which is, "<em>public</em> land * * * 
belonging to the Government * * *." As to such land the issuance of the 
certificate vests an absolute title in the homesteader, but as to land which is 
<em>not</em> public and does <em>not</em> belong to the Government, it can have 
no such effect.</p>
<p>This conclusion is strengthened by consideration of the fact that there is no 
express declaration in section 122 of any intention on the part of the 
Legislature to give to the act of registration of the patent—a mere ministerial 
act by an administrative official—the effect of divesting all outstanding 
titles, or to convert a void patent into a valid title by the mere act of 
registration.</p>
<p>The incontestable and absolute character of the Torrens titles issued after 
judicial proceedings under the Land Registration Act is conferred by the 
language of sections 38 and 39. Section 38 declares that the <em>"decree of 
registration"</em> entered by the court shall bind the land and "be conclusive 
upon and against all persons." Section 39 establishes the incontestable validity 
of certificates of title issued <em>"in pursuance of a decree of 
registration."</em> Nowhere in these sections or elsewhere in Act No. 496 is it 
declared that similar conclusive validity is to attach to certificates not based 
upon a "decree of registration." Certainly the mere ministerial act of 
transcribing a homestead patent in a book and issuing a certified copy of the 
entry is not such a decree.</p>
<p>We are, therefore, of the opinion, and so hold, that neither the patent 
issued by the Director of Lands to applicants for homesteads/nor tne certificate 
of title issued by the register of deeds upon the patent are conclusive with 
respect to the title of the patentee as against private individuals claiming the 
land against the patentee "under title anterior to the issuance of the patent, 
although the possession of such a certificate carries with it the presumption 
that the land to which it relates was public land at the time of the issuance of 
the patent to the original holder and casts upon the opposing litigant the 
burden of overcoming that presumption, as well as any unfavorable inferences to 
which his contentions may be open should he have been guilty of laches in the 
assertion of his rights.</p>
<p>The decision of the lower court is reversed, and the case is remanded for a 
new trial. No costs will be allowed on this appeal. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Johnson, Street, Malcolm</em>, and <em>Avanceña, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p></div>
