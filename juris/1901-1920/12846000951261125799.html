				G.R. No. 12857, September 06, 1917</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. ALFREDO MANIQUIS, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This defendant was charged with the breach of a conditional pardon. The 
complaint alleged:
<blockquote>
<p>That said accused, on or about January 9, 1916, in the municipality of 
Malolos, Province of Bulacan, P. I., was sentenced by the justice of the peace 
court of Malolos, Bulacan, to five months' imprisonment to be served in the 
provincial jail of Bulacan, for theft; and that said crime was committed in 
breach of the pardon granted to him prior to the date above mentioned, the 
precise condition of which pardon being that the accused should not thenceforth 
be convicted of any crime or bad conduct; with violation of 
law."</p></blockquote>
<p>Upon said complaint the appellant was arrested and arraigned. Upon 
arraignment he plead guilty, and was sentenced to be returned to the Lolomboy 
Reformatory until he should reach his majority, or until the 31st day of 
January, 1919. From that sentence he appealed.</p>
<p>In this court his attorney recommends an affirmation of the sentence of the 
lower court. The Attorney-General recommends an affirmation of the sentence of 
the lower court, with the modification that the appellant should be detained in 
one of the reformatories established by the Government in the place of that of 
Lolomboy.</p>
<p>An examination of the record discloses nothing upon which the decision of the 
lower court may be modified.</p>
<p>The sentence of the lower court is, therefore, hereby affirmed with the 
modification recommended by the Attorney-General, with costs. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Carson, Araullo, Street</em> and <em>Malcolm, JJ</em>., 
concur.</p></div>
