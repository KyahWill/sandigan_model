				<BR><STRONG>TRENT, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">An appeal by Jose Vayson from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of 
Misamis, sentencing him to six months' imprisonment and to the payment of the 
costs of the cause for a violation of the Election Law. The original information 
is as follows:
<blockquote>
<p>"Jose Baison is accused by the undersigned of a violation of paragraph 4, 
section 30, of the Election Law, committed as follows:</p>
<p>"That the said Jose Baison, on or about the 4th day of June, 1912, at the 
municipality of Misamis, Province of Misamis, knowing that he was not entitled 
so to do, did then and there maliciously and unlawfully vote at the general 
elections for delegates to the Philippine Assembly, and provincial and municipal 
officials, the said Jose Baison being then and there delinquent in the payment 
of land taxes in the amount of P56.88 for the years 1908, 1909, 1910, and 1911, 
contrary to the statute in such cases made and provided.—Misamis, Misamis, 
September 29, 1913,"</p></blockquote>
<p>The defendant was arraigned on September 29, 1913, at which time the court 
asked him the following question:</p>
<p>JUDGE. You are accused of having violated paragraph 4 of section 30, of the 
Election Law, in that you did maliciously and intentionally vote in the general 
election held on June 4, 1912, you being delinquent in the sum of P56.88 in the 
payment of your land taxes for the years 1908, 1909, 1910, and 1911. What do you 
say to this charge? Do you plead guilty or not guilty?</p>
<p>DEFENDANT. Guilty.<br><br>Upon recommendation of the fiscal the defendant was 
then, on September 29th, sentenced to imprisonment for the period of one month 
and to the payment of the costs. On the 3d of October, 1913, the defendant was 
called into court and the following proceedings were had in his presence:</p>
<p>FISCAL (addressing the court.) I ask permission of the court to amend the 
information presented in this case by changing the word "Baison" to "Vayson" and 
the number "4" just after the word "paragraph," substituting therefor number 1, 
so that the same will read "Paragraph number 1."</p>
<p>COURT. The motion is admitted.</p>
<p>COURT (addressing the defendant). Are you the vice-president of the town of 
Misamis, Province of Misamis?</p>
<p>DEFENDANT. Formerly, yes; but now, no. I presented my resignation in the 
month of May.</p>
<p>COURT. Were you elected vice-president in 1912?</p>
<p>DEFENDANT, Yes, sir;</p>
<p>The court then revoked the sentence dated September 29,and imposed in lieu 
thereof a sentence of six months' imprisonment.</p>
<p>The first sentence was imposed upon the recommendation for leniency made by 
the fiscal on the ground that the defendant was one "of a class of poor ignorant 
persons whose violations of the Election Law should not be punished too 
severely, owing to their want of education," The proceedings had on the 3d of 
October developed that the defendant had been vice-president of his 
municipality, was a candidate for that office when he committed the offense for 
which he was charged, and had been delinquent in his taxes for four years. The 
court considered these facts sufficient to call for the imposition of a heavier 
penalty. Both sentences were within the discretion reposed in the trial court 
under the first paragraph of section 30 of the Election Law, defining and 
penalizing the offense of which the defendant was guilty. In our opinion the 
imposition of six months' imprisonment is not excessive. This punishment is now 
questioned on that ground.</p>
<p>The information was amended, as above indicated, after the defendant had 
entered his plea, but the changes made were mere corrections of clerical errors 
and did not change the allegations concerning the commission of the crime. The 
defendant was charged originally with a violation of paragraph 4 of section 30 
of the Election Law, but the allegations which follow in the second paragraph of 
the original information and the explanation given the defendant by the court 
show that it was the first paragraph of section 30 which was violated and not 
the fourth. The fourth paragraph penalizes the act of taking or subscribing to 
any false oath concerning any material fact in any registration or election 
proceedings, while the first paragraph penalizes any person who votes or 
attempts to vote, knowing that he is not entitled so to do. The result is that 
the correction of the clerical errors in the complaint could not and did not 
prejudice the rights of the defendant.</p>
<p>We will now inquire whether the court had the power under the facts and 
circumstances above set forth to set aside its original judgment and impose the 
penalty of six months. In determining this question it must be borne in mind 
that the defendant had served no part of the original sentence when the second 
sentence was pronounced.</p>
<p>In the case of Arnedo <em>vs.</em> Llorente (18 Phil. Rep., 257), this Court 
said: "When not otherwise provided by statute, all courts in the Islands have 
plenary control over the proceedings had before them, as also of judgments 
therein, until such judgments become final in the sense that the party in whose 
favor they are rendered is entitled as of right, to have execution thereon, and, 
in the exercise of a sound discretion, the courts may take such action touching 
the vacation and amendment of these judgments as truth and justice may 
require."</p>
<p>This doctrine, as to civil cases, has recently been affirmed in De Fiesta 
<em>vs.</em> Llorente (25 Phil. Rep., 554); and Broce vs. Apurado (26 Phil. 
Rep., 581). Does it apply to criminal cases? In United States <em>vs.</em> 
Crossfield (24 Phil. Rep., 321), this court held that the Court of First 
Instance had no power to modify its judgment in a criminal case after the 
expiration of the period for appeal. This case negatively admits the proposition 
that a Court of First Instance would have the power to modify its judgment in a 
criminal case before it became final, that is, before the expiration of the time 
allowed for an appeal, is it true that the accused may not object to such action 
on the part of the court when the proposed change is not desired by him? Upon 
this precise question, we are not aware of any precedents in this jurisdiction. 
The case of <em>Ex parte</em> Lange (85 U. S., 163, 21 L. ed., 872), states the 
general rule as follows: "The general power of the court over its own judgments, 
orders and decrees, in both civil and criminal cases, during the existence of 
the term to which they are first made, is undeniable."</p>
<p>That case, however, must be considered as an exception to the general rule 
thus announced. Whereas, the statute provided for imprisonment or a fine, the 
court had imposed imprisonment <em>and</em> a fine. The prisoner had paid the 
latter and had served five days of the prison sentence, when the court, during 
the same term, called him to the bar and amended its judgment so that it called 
for imprisonment only. The Supreme Court held that the payment of the fine was 
an authorized punishment for the crime and that the revision of the sentence was 
in effect subjecting the prisoner to a second punishment, which was contrary to 
the jeopardy clause of the Constitution. This exception to the general rule has 
been recognized in a number of cases, the majority of which are referred to in 
the Notes of United States Reports, vol, 8, p. 159. But it is apparent that, as 
the present defendant had served no part of the original sentence, he cannot 
bring himself within the exception.</p>
<p>In Bradford <em>vs.</em> People (22 Colo., 157), judgment calling for 
imprisonment for one year was pronounced on January 28. On January 31, the 
court, on its own motion, set aside this judgment and entered another, 
sentencing the defendant to imprisonment for one year on each of three counts. 
As it was specifically provided, however, that all of these sentences should run 
concurrently, the aggregate of the sentences in the revised judgment was the 
same as the first.</p>
<p>The court said: "In cases where the defendant has entered upon the execution 
of a valid sentence, it is well established that such sentence cannot be set 
aside and a new sentence entered. The sentence in this case was for the full 
term of one year in the state penitentiary, and his incarceration in the county 
jail of Arapahoe county, temporarily or otherwise could not be credited upon his 
term; it was simply a means<br>to an end, in order that the defendant might not 
escape until he could be safely conveyed to and lodged in the state 
penitentiary. It was no part of his sentence under the statute, and the time so 
spent could not be deducted from his term, as it is provided that the term shall 
be computed from and including the day on which he is received into the 
penitentiary."</p>
<p>In Tillman <em>vs.</em> State (58 Pla., 113), it was said that "during the 
same term of court at which the sentence is imposed, before the defendant had 
begun serving such sentence, the trial judge has the power to modify such 
sentence."</p>
<p>In State <em>vs</em>. Dougherty (70 Iowa, 489), judgment was entered against 
the defendant on his plea of guilty for a fine and costs. At the same term and 
before any part of the judgment had been complied with, the court set the 
judgment aside and entered another judgment, which imposed a greater fine.</p>
<p>The appellate court said: "The question in the case is whether the court, 
after it had entered a judgment in regular form against the defendant, had the 
power, at the same term and before any part of the judgment had been performed, 
to set that judgment aside, and enter another judgment against him imposing a 
heavier penalty. The power of the courts to revise, correct and change their 
sentences, at the term at which they are pronounced, and before anything has 
been done under them, has long been recognized both in this country and in 
England; and the cases are numerous in which the power has been exercised. (See 
Com. <em>vs.</em> Weymouth, 2 Allen, 144; U. S. <em>vs.</em> Harmison, 3 Sawy., 
556; Memphis <em>vs.</em> Brown, 94 U. S., 715; Ex parte Sawyer, 21 Wall., 235; 
Burnside <em>vs.</em> Ennis, 43 Ind., 411; Regina <em>vs.</em> Fitz gerald, 1 
Salk., 401; Rex <em>vs.</em> Price, 6 East, 323; Rex 
<em>vs.</em><br>Leicestershire Justices, 1 Maule &amp; S., 442.)"</p>
<p>In State <em>vs.</em> Hughes (35 Kan., 626), the defendant was sentenced to 
imprisonment at hard labor in the penitentiary for six months. Within an hour 
after sentence was pronounced, the attention of the court was called to the fact 
that no person could be sentenced to imprisonment at hard labor in the state 
prison for less than one year. The court thereupon proceeded to sentence the 
prisoner to imprisonment for a term of one year.</p>
<p>The supreme court said: "The sentence first pronounced against the defendant 
was not executed or put into operation and 'so long as it remained unexecuted, 
it was, in contemplation of law, in the breast of the court, and subject to 
revision and alteration.' (Com. vs. Weymouth, 2 Allen, 147.) We think it was 
clearly within the discretion and power of the court until the end of the term, 
to amend and revise or increase the sentence which had not gone into effect. (1 
Bish. on Gr. Proc., sec. 1298, and cases cited.) As nothing had been done under 
the sentence first pronounced, and as the final sentence did not impose a 
penalty in excess of that provided by law, the rights of the defendant were not 
infringed upon, nor has he any ground for complaint"</p>
<p>In Commonwealth vs. Weymouth (2 Allen, Mass., 144; 79 Am. Dec, 776), the 
defendant was first sentenced to two years' imprisonment in a house of 
correction. On the next day, the prosecuting attorney moved for a revision of 
the sentence and, over the prisoner's protest, additional testimony was heard, 
after which the original judgment was revised and the defendant sentenced to 
imprisonment in the state prison for three and one-half years, the first two 
days of which were to be solitary. After citing authorities, the court held the 
rule to be that if no action has been taken, there is no good reason for 
refusing to vacate the judgment for sufficient cause and substituting a new one 
in its place.</p>
<p>The court said: "The petitioner in the present case is not subjected by the 
amended sentence of the court to any punishment for his offense other or greater 
than that allowed by law. He was never taken or charged on the warrant which was 
issued on the sentence as originally pronounced. That sentence never went into 
operation, and in effect, was the same as if it had never been passed. So long 
as it remained unexecuted, it was, in contemplation of law, in the breast of the 
court, and subject to revision and alteration. He was not injured or put in 
jeopardy by it any further than he would have been by a conclusion or judgment 
of the court as to the extent of his punishment, which had not been announced. 
Until something was done to carry the sentence into execution, by subjecting the 
prisoner to the warrant in the hands of the officer, no right or privilege to 
which he was entitled was taken away or invaded by revoking the sentence first 
pronounced and substituting in its stead the one under which he now stands 
charged. If it had appeared that the petitioner had actually been taken and 
committed under the first sentence, or if he had been thereby condemned to 
imprisonment in the state prison, so that the term of his sentence would be 
computed from the time he was first ordered to remain in the custody of the 
sheriff, according to the statutes of 1859, chapter 248, we might have arrived 
at a different result; but on the record as it stands, we are all of opinion 
that the order must be, Prisoner remanded."</p>
<p>In Lee <em>vs.</em> State (32 Ohio, 113), the defendant pleaded guilty to a 
charge of illegally selling intoxicating liquor and was sentenced to pay a fine 
and costs of the cause. These proceedings were had on May 12, 1874, but no steps 
were taken to carry the sentence into execution. On the 15th of the same month, 
the defendant was again before the court, this time on a charge of selling 
liquor to a minor, and the court then finding that in passing the said sentence 
it had acted under a misapprehension of the facts of the case, and that no 
portion of said fine and costs had been paid or secured, and that the defendant 
had not, been taken into custody under said judgment, set aside the same, and 
proceeded, over the defendant's objection, to sentence him to a heavier 
fine.<br><br>The court said: "The single question is, had the court the power to 
revise and increase its judgment, at the same term before any part of the fine 
and costs had been paid, and before any steps had been taken to execute it?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That this power exists, is settled by a long line of decisions of the 
highest authority. * * *</p>
<p>"It appears from the record, that in passing the first sentence, the court 
acted under a misapprehension of the facts.</p>
<p>"In the absence of a showing to the contrary, we must presume that there were 
sufficient reasons addressing themselves to the sound judicial discretion of the 
court for such action, and that it was deemed to be necessary in furtherance of 
justice and the due administration of the law. It is said this is a dangerous 
power. The same may be said of the exercise of all judicial discretion. This is 
equally as true of the discretion exercised in the first instance, in fixing the 
sentence, as in that exercised in revising it.</p>
<p>"If the court in revising its own sentence confines itself to such 
information as it has the right to have in the first instance, no greater danger 
of abuse exists than in the exercise of judicial discretion in rendering its 
first judgment.</p>
<p>"The power to revise judgments of the same term, and, before execution has 
commenced, to correct errors and mistakes is necessary for the protection of the 
defendant, as well as the public, and may be exercised as well in his favor as 
against him, when the court has been misled by mistake or 
fraud."</p></blockquote>
<p>In Nichols<em> vs.</em> United States (106 Fed., 672), the Circuit Court of 
Appeals for the Eighth District had under consideration the act of a district 
judge under the following circumstances: After verdict and before rendering 
sentence, the judge called the attorney for the defendant to the bar and asked 
if it was the intention to prosecute the matter any further, and, understanding 
that it was not, the court stated that he would enter a fine of $100 against the 
defendant and imprisonment for six months. Thereupon counsel said that he 
intended to prosecute an appeal, and the court called up the defendant, who was 
still within the bar, and directed the clerk to enter a fine of $100 and 
imprisonment for twelve months.</p>
<p>The Circuit Court said: "The extent of the punishment to be inflicted on the 
defendant, within the limit prescribed by the statute for the offense, rested in 
the sound judicial discretion of the court. The imposition of the first sentence 
did not put an end to the exercise of this discretion. The first sentence was 
not recorded. The defendant had not yet left the bar, and had not satisfied or 
suffered any part of the punishment thereunder, when it was set aside and the 
second sentence imposed. Under these conditions, it was competent. for the court 
to reconsider its sentence and impose a different one. (Ex parte Lange, 18 
Wall., 163; 21 L. ed., 872.) The bill of exceptions does not show that the first 
sentence was set aside, and the second imposed, doubling the period of 
imprisonment, because the defendant had declared his intention of appealing the 
case. A new sentence, with enhanced punishment, based upon such a reason, would 
be a flagrant violation of the rights of the defendant. It would be the 
infliction of a penalty for the exercise of a clear legal right, and would call 
for the severest censure. But no such motive can be imputed to the court below. 
This court is bound to presume that the lower court, in recalling its first and 
imposing a second and more severe sentence, did so from right and proper 
motives, and for the purpose of imposing a punishment which, upon reflection, it 
deemed better suited to the offense."</p>
<p>In England the authorities are the same way. In King <em>vs.</em> Price (6 
East, 323; 102 Eng. Rep., 1310), the defendant was convicted of illegally voting 
at an election and was sentenced to one month's imprisonment in Newgate and to 
be then transported beyond the seas for seven years. At the same term and upon 
further consideration of the law governing the case, the court proceeded to 
impose a more severe sentence.</p>
<p>The recently compiled encyclopedia, entitled the Laws of England (vol. 9, p. 
377), affirms the rule as follows: "The court may at any time during the same 
assizes or sessions, before the judgment has been entered on the record, vacate 
the judgment passed and substitute another."</p>
<p>American textwriters are also in full accord with the doctrine under 
discussion. Black on Judgments, section 153 (citing State <em>vs.</em> 
Dougherty, 70 Iowa, 439, supra), says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is even held that the court, in a criminal action, may set aside a 
judgment made in regular course, imposing on the defendant a fine and the costs 
of the proceedings, during the same term at which the judgment was rendered, and 
before any part of it has been performed, and may impose a greater fine than was 
imposed by the first judgment."</p></blockquote>
<p>In 12 Cyc, 783, it is said: "At any time during the term the court has the 
power to reconsider the judgment, and to revise and correct it by mitigating and 
even by increasing its severity, where the original sentence has not been 
executed or put into operation; but where the prisoner has paid his fine or his 
imprisonment has begun, the court has no power to recall him to revoke his 
former sentence and impose one which inflicts a greater punishment."</p>
<p>And in 1 Bishop's New Crim. Procedure, sec. 1298, it is said: "The power of 
the court to alter its docket entries and records during the term wherein they 
are made includes the right within such time to revise, correct and change its 
sentences, however formally pronounced, if nothing has been done under them. But 
steps taken under a sentence— for example, a substantial part execution 
thereof—will cut off the right to alter it, even during the term, and with the 
expiration of the term the power expires."</p>
<p>As was said in the Arnedo case, the term system in vogue in the United States 
and England has no place in this country. The power of the courts in this 
country over their judgments expires when they become final. Between the entry 
of the judgment and the date it becomes final is a period allowed by law for 
appeal or vacation of the judgment entered. It is during this period of time and 
to the same extent as the courts of England and America, that our courts have 
control over their judgments to modify and revise.</p>
<p>The authorities we have reviewed above demonstrate that until a criminal 
judgment has become final and unless the defendant has complied in whole or in 
part with the penalty imposed, the court may revise its judgment by either 
increasing or decreasing the penalty imposed, so long as it keeps within the 
limits of the penalty provided by law. Such a modification of the sentence is 
within the sound discretion of the court, and unless a review of the evidence 
shows that such discretion has been abused, affords no basis for complaint on 
the part of either the prosecution or the defendant.</p>
<p>In the present case the revised judgment of the court relates that the 
defendant "has not yet begun to serve the sentence imposed upon him." The facts 
developed upon the. second hearing show clearly that the court did not abuse its 
discretion in revising his sentence. There is therefore no reversible error in 
the judgment appealed from and it is hereby affirmed, with costs against the 
appellant.</p>
