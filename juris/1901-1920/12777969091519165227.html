				<H3>MANUEL DE LEON, PETITIONER, VS. VICENTE NEPOMUCENO, JUDGE OF FIRST INSTANCE OF TARLAC, AND SANTIAGO DE JESUS, PROVINCIAL SHERIFF, RESPONDENTS.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Judgment for costs was rendered in the Court of First Instance of Tarlac in 
an election contest proceeding in the following terms:
<p>"Las costas y gastos de la protesta se pagaran por el protestado y 
tercerista. (The costs and expenses of the contest will be paid by the protestee 
and the intervener.)"</p>
<p>The judgment entered in these contest proceedings was appealed to this court 
and in due course the judgment, including the provision for the payment of costs 
and expenses of the contest, was affirmed- The record was returned to the Court 
of First Instance of Tarlac and upon its return the judgment became final.</p>
<p>Petitioner, the protestee, alleges that the sheriff of the Province of 
Tarlac, with the express approval of the respondent judge of the court of first 
instance of that province, is proceeding to enforce the above-cited judgment 
against him as though it were a "joint and several" judgment for costs and 
expenses and not merely a "joint" judgment, and petitioner prays that the 
respondent be restrained from all further attempts to enforce the judgment for 
costs as a "joint and several" judgment.<br><br>To the petitioner's prayer for 
relief the respondents demur, and in the course of the argument in support of 
the demurrer various questions have been raised as to the nature and extent of 
the authority of the courts to tax costs and expenses in election contests. It 
is urged on the one hand that, when third persons are brought into election 
contest proceedings by notice, the court may tax costs against them in like 
manner to that in which costs are fixed against the losing parties in other 
actions. On the other hand, it is contended that, when third persons are brought 
into election contest proceedings by notice, the question of their liability for 
costs depends wholly upon their conduct thereafter; and it is said that if they 
decline to exercise their right to intervene, or if in fact they do not 
voluntarily take any part in the proceedings the court should not tax any part 
of the costs against them.</p>
<p>So also conflicting contentions have arisen in the course of the discussion 
as to whether, in the event that such third persons do in fact intervene and 
take an active part in the election contest, the court should tax the costs 
jointly and severally against all the losing parties, or in proportion to the 
costs and expenses resulting from their respective activities, or upon such 
other basis as the particular circumstances of the case would seem to 
require.</p>
<p>We are of opinion, however, that it is not necessary for us to consider or 
decide any of those contentions at this time. The only question before us is 
whether the judgment actually entered by the court below and affirmed upon 
appeal is or is not a "joint and several" judgment. If it is "joint and several" 
the petitioner has no cause of action in support of his prayer for relief from 
its enforcement by the levy of execution upon his goods. If it is not a "joint 
and several" judgment, and if, as the petitioner contends, it is merely a 
"joint" judgment, he is clearly entitled to relief from any attempt in the court 
below to enforce it as a "joint and several" judgment.</p>
<p>It is admitted by the demurrer, and clearly appears from the record that the 
judgment has become final and unappealable. The parties cannot, therefore, be 
heard at this time to urge that, under the law of the facts, some other judgment 
should have been entered than that which was in fact entered, and which has long 
since become final and unappealable. Contentions of this kind, if well founded, 
should have been advanced while the judgment was open for reconsideration in the 
court below, or while the record was before us on appeal. (Cf. Ruling upon 
supplemental motion in Manila Railroad Co. <em>vs</em>. Alano, 36 Phil. Rep., 
500.)</p>
<p>Examining the language dÂ¥ the judgment for costs, which is set out in the 
foregoing statement of facts, it is manifest that it is merely a joint judgment 
against the protestado y tercerista, and does not permit of construction or 
interpretation as a "joint and several" judgment. No argument is necessary. It 
is sufficient to cite here articles 1137 and 1138 of the Civil Code as to the 
rule in this jurisdiction.</p>
<p>"Art. 1137. The concurrence of two or more creditors, or of two or more 
debtors, in a single obligation, does not imply that each one of the former has 
a right to ask, nor that each one of the latter is bound to comply in full with 
the things which are the objects of the same. This shall only take place when 
the obligation determines it expressly, being constituted as a joint and several 
obligation.</p>
<p>"Art. 1138. If from the context of the obligation referred to in the 
preceding article, any other thing does not appear, the credit or the debt shall 
be presumed as divided in as many equal parts as there are creditors or debtors, 
and shall be considered as credits or debts, each one different from the 
other."</p>
<p>"A joint obligation under the law of Louisiana binds the parties thereto only 
for their proportion of the debt, whilst a solidary obligation, on the contrary, 
binds each of the obligors for the whole debt." (Groves <em>vs</em>. Sentell, 14 
Sup. Ct., 898, 901; 153 U. S., 465; 38 L. Ed., 785.) </p>
<p>From what has been said, it is manifest that the demurrer must be overruled, 
and that unless the respondents file an answer within ten days from the entry of 
this opinion (which we do not anticipate) judgment should be entered securing to 
petitioner the relief to which he is entitled upon the facts disclosed by the 
petition.</p>
<p>Unless an answer is filed within ten days from the entry of this order, let 
judgment be entered dissolving the preliminary injunction heretofore allowed in 
these proceedings, and directing the respondents to refrain from any further 
measures looking to the enforcement of the judgment for costs and expenses in 
the election contest proceedings had in the Court of First Instance of Tarlac, 
wherein Ernesto Gardiner was protestant, and Manuel de Leon was protestee, and 
Cecilio Torres was cited to appear as intervener or tercerisia, as a "joint and 
several" judgment for costs and expenses, and directing the respondent judge to 
enter such orders as may be convenient or necessary to revoke and set aside any 
order or orders heretofore entered in the Court of First Instance of the 
Province of Tarlac looking to the enforcement of that judgment as a "joint and 
several" judgment. The costs of these proceedings will be taxed against the 
respondent sheriff, Santiago de Jesus. So ordered.</p><em>Arellano, C. J., 
Torres, Araullo</em>, and <em>Street, JJ</em>., concur. <br><br><br>
<hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1">

<p><strong>MALCOLM, J.,</strong> concurring:</p>
<p>The majority decision says only that this court will not disturb a certain 
judgment entered by a Court of First Instance and affirmed upon appeal by the 
Supreme Court. For fear that what is found in this decision may be taken as 
indicating approval of such a judgment, I am constrained to explain my views 
regarding the fixing of costs in election contests.</p>
<p>The facts herein are simple. Three candidates for provincial governor of 
Tarlac. De Leon declared elected. Contest by Gardiner against De Leon with 
notice to the third candidate Torres. Gardiner wins. Expenses and costs taxed. 
It is found that Torres, the third candidate, is insolvent. The point, as 
resolved by this court under certiorari and injunction proceedings, is that De 
Leon is only liable under a "joint" judgment.</p>
<p>The law is plain. An election contest is a special, summary proceeding. It is 
not an "action" as we think of this term in pleading and practice. The Election 
Law provides within itself a complete procedure for the determination of 
election contest. Sections 481 and 482 of the present Administrative Code state 
explicitly how the costs shall be taxed. Although the practice in election 
contests is well known, let us elucidate succinctly.</p>
<p>The contest of an election is begun by motion with notice. This is exactly 
what Gardiner, the protestant, did in an endeavor to obtain possession of the 
office of provincial governor. Torres, the third candidate, was merely an 
unwilling party to the action. In reality, he was not technically a party to the 
contest nor an intervener in the proceedings. Before the court could entertain 
this motion, the party making the motion, i. e. Gardiner, was required to give 
bond in an amount fixed by the court with two sureties satisfactory to it 
"conditioned that he will pay all expenses and costs incident to such motion." 
The protestant is also permitted to deposit cash in lieu of such bond. If, 
therefore, Gardiner had been unsuccessful, provision was made for the paying of 
the costs by him. The law also looks after the opposite possibility. Thus, it is 
provided that "if the party paying such expenses and costs shall be successful, 
they shall be taxed by the court and entered and be collected <em>as a judgment 
against the defeated party."</em> This language is easily understandable. There 
can be no question as to who or what is meant by "defeated party." The person in 
office, in this case De Leon, who is ousted, is the defeated party. The law thus 
provides how the costs shall be paid if the protestant is unsuccessful, and how 
they shall be paid if the protestant is successful. In neither instance is a 
third party candidate involved. Suppose for example that in this particular 
contest instead of Torres, the third candidate being found to be insolvent, it 
had happened that De Leon was found to be insolvent, the result would be that 
Torres, a candidate who received a few complimentary votes, who was brought into 
the contest only by notice, and who had no chance of being declared elected, 
would have been forced to pay all the costs of the proceedings.</p>
<p>The fixing of costs in election contests is therefore not a question of joint 
or several liability or of joint liability, but is simply an application of the 
precise provisions of the law to the facts.</p></div>
