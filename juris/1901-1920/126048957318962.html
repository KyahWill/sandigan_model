				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> On the  11th day of February, 1903,  application was made by Frank Mekin to the Hob. B. S. Ambler, judge of the Court of First Instance, for  a writ of <em>habeas corpus</em> against George  N. Wolfe, Warden of  Bilibid Prison, for the illegal imprisonment,  detention, and confinement of petitioner by the respondent  as warden of  said prison, arid setting forth in substance the following facts:</p>
<p> That petitioner  was a  member of the  Thirty-seventh Infantry, United  States  Volunteers, up to the date of his discharge, which  occurred  on the—day of February, 1901;  that after  his discharge, to  wit,  the  13th day of July, 1901, the  petitioner was tried by a military commission composed  of officers of the  United States Eegular Army on the charge of entering the service of  the enemy in violation of the laws  of war and  was  found guilty and sentenced by said military commission to twenty years of hard labor in the Presidio  of  Manila,  where he is at present confined.   That  the  military  commission  acted without  jurisdiction in so trying  and sentencing the petitioner for the reason that it had neither jurisdiction of the person of the petitioner nor jurisdiction of the crime for which he  was  tried and sentenced;  that  at the time of the trial  the petitioner was a civilian, and  is therefore entitled to the benefit of  the amnesty proclamation issued by the President of the United States on the 4th day of July, 1902.</p>
<p> The writ of <em>habeas corpus </em> was issued and was served upon the respondent, George N. Wolfe,  who made return: That he, as Warden of Bilibid, held said Frank Mekin  imprisoned under authority of the United  States of America through the  lawful orders of the commanding general, Division of the Philippines, issued by virtue of a lawful sentence of a duly  convened military commission, for an offense in  violation of the laws of war and against  the United States of America, which conviction and  sentence was duly approved by the convening authority on September 23,1901, and which sentence was lawfully commuted to imprisonment at hard labor for the term of tAventy years by the said commanding general  of  the Division of  the Philippines, the record of which conviction and  sentence and  the  approval  thereof  and of the said  commuted sentence and order of confinement—in the Presidio of Manila—was  set forth in  General Orders, No.  362, dated headquarters Division of the Philippines,  Manila, P.  I., November 30, 1901, copies of which said record and said order were attached to the return, and the respondent also attached to his return the certificate of  George  W. Davis, major-general, United States Army, commanding the Division of the Philippines, and made it a part of his return.</p>
<p> The respondent prayed  for the dismissal of the writ of <em>habeas corpus</em>, assigning as a cause that the court was without jurisdiction to issue the writ of habeas  corpus for the reason that the said Frank Mekin  was held as a prisoner by virtue of the sentence of the said military commission, awarded prior to October 1, 1901, and  that the issuance of said writ was in contravention of the statute of the Philippine Commission, Act No. 272, entitled "An act amending chapter 20, relating to proceedings in <em>habeas corpus</em>."</p>
<p> The certificate  of George W.  Davis, major-general, United  States Army,  commanding in  the Philippines, referred to in the return, is as follows:</p>
<p> "Headquarters Division of the Philippines, Manila, P. I., February 18,  1903.   To the Hon. B. S.  Ambler, judge of the Court of .First Instance, Manila, P. I. Sir: I hereby certify that Frank Mekin  is held by me as commanding general,  Division  of  the Philippines, in  the  Presidio of Manila, and at the expense of the United States, by virtue of a sentence of a  military commission, published  in General  Orders, No. 362, dated headquarters Division of the Philippines, Manila, P.  I.,  November 20,  1901 (a  copy of which order is herewith submitted), as  a prisoner duly sentenced prior 1o October 1, 1901, by said commission and duly  approved by the reviewing authority prior  to said date, and which said  sentence was dulv commuted bv the commanding general, Division of the Philippines, which commutation was  duly  published in said order, and that the  said Frank Mekin is a  prisoner who was arrested and held for trial before October 15, 1901, for a violation of the laws  of war committed  before that date, and is now held by George N. Wolfe,  as Warden of Bilibid Prison, as my agent.  Very respectfully,  (signed)  Geo.  W. Davis, General, United States Army, commanding."</p>
<p> On February 18, 1903, a hearing of the habeas corpus proceedings was hart, the Government being represented by the Prosecuting Attorney and by the Judge-Advocate-General, Division of the Philippines, and on the 9th day of March, 1903, the judge of the Court of First Instance rendered his decision, in which it was determined that the approval and commutation of the sentence under which the prisoner is now serving was promulgated  on the 20th day of November, 1.1)01 ; that the trial before the military commission not being  disclosed by the evidence, the sentence of the military commission had no other effect than to hold the  prisoner awaiting the approval of the commanding general;  that the commanding  general having seen fit to commute the sentence to twenty years'  imprisonment the conviction or sentence under which the petitioner is serving must be regarded as of date November 20, 1901, and that the case does not come under the provisions of Act No. 272 of the Philippine Commission.</p>
<p> After reviewing the questions as to the jurisdiction of the military commission,  and apparently reaching the conclusion that the military commission had  no jurisdiction to try the petitioner, the judge found that the petitioner came within the  general amnesty proclamation  and  was entitled to its benefits,  and directed that he be discharged from custody upon his taking and subscribing the oath of allegiance provided for in the amnesty proclamation.</p>
<p> An appeal was taken by  the  Government  from this decision.</p>
<p> Subsequent to the date of  the filing of the  application for <em>habeas corpus</em> but prior to the date of the trial and of the judgment in the case, the Philippine Commission promulgated Act No. 654, dated  March 4, 1903, by the  provisions of which an appeal in <em>habeas corpus </em>proceedings may be taken from the judgment of the Court of First Instance to this court, the  decision of  this  court  having previously been that no appeal would lie in such a case in the absence of a statute authorizing it.</p>
<p> It is contended by counsel for this petitioner that Act No. 654 is in the nature of an ep post facto law, and having been enacted subsequent to petitioner's  right to the writ of habeas  corpus  this appeal should not be entertained. This contention is unsupported by either  precedent or principle.  It  is difficult  to conceive  any reason  for such  a conclusion.</p>
<p> An <em>ex post facto</em> law has been defined as one—</p>
(a) Which makes  an action done before the  passing of the law  and which was  innocent  when done criminal, and punishes such action; or<p></p>
<p> (b) Which aggravates a crime or makes it greater than it was when committed; or</p>
<p> (c) Which changes the punishment and inflicts a greater punishment than  the law  annexed  to  the crime  when it was committed; or</p>
<p>  (d) Which alters the legal rules of evidence and receives less or different testimony than the law required at the time of the commission of the offense in order to convict the defendant.   (Black, Constitutional Law, 595.)</p>
<p> The case clearly does not  come within this definition, nor can  it. be seen in what  way the act in question alters the  situation of petitioner  to his disadvantage. It gives him, as well as the Government, the benefit of the appeal, and is intended as furnishing the means for the correction of errors.  The possibility that the judge of the Court of First Instance  maycommit error in his favor  and wrongfully discharge him appears to be the only foundation for the claim.</p>
<p> A person can have no vested right in such a possibility.</p>
<p> It would be a sufficient answer to the contention of the petitioner that  Act No. 654,  allowing an appeal, relates to a <em>habeas corpus</em> proceeding.   This character of proceeding is entirely distinct from the criminal proceedings under which the prisoner has been tried and convicted.  It is a new suit brought by petitioner to enforce a civil right which he claims as against those who are holding him in custody under tin;  criminal process.  The proceeding  is one instituted by himself for his liberty  and not by  the Government to punish him for his crime.   (<em>Ex parte</em> Tom Tong, 108 U.S.556.)</p>
<p> It is distinctly a civil proceeding, and as such is provided for and regulated in the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p> The doctrine of <em>ex post facto</em> laws refers  only to  the criminal  law.</p>
<p> This case must be determined under the provisions of Act No. 272, "An act amending chapter 26, relating to proceedings of <em>habeas corpus</em>, enacted by the Philippine Commission on the 21st day of October, 1901.  The history of  the legislation embodied in  this act is too recent to require a review of the circumstances and conditions under which it was enacted.  Its purpose was to prevent a conflict of jurisdiction between the civil and military branches of the Government.  By the provisions of this act, when <the commanding="" any="" general="" officer="" command="" the="" department="" or="" district="" certifies="" in="" answer="" to="" a="" writ="" of=""><em>habeas corpus </em>directed against a military officer or soldier that the prisoner is held by him either—</the></p>
<p> (1) As a prisoner of war; or</p>
<p> (2)  As a member of the Army, a civil employee thereof, or a camp follower subject to its, discipline; or</p>
<p> (3)  As a prisoner committed by a military court or commission prior to October 1,  1901; or</p>
<p> (4)  As a prisoner arrested and held for trial before a military court or commission, before October 15, 1901, for a violation of the laws of war committed before the same date; or</p>
<p> (5)  As a person guilty of the violation of the laws of war committed  in  certain unpacifled  provinces  and territories named— </p>
<p> such certificate shall be a conclusive answer to a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>against a military officer or soldier, and a sufficient excuse for not producing the prisoner.</p>
<p> It is not disputed that the respondent holds the petitioner  by and through the orders of the commanding general, Division of the Philippines, and that he is  in the custody of the  United States Government through the respondent, the Warden of Bilibid, as the agent and representative of the  military,  such agency  appears  in the certificate of the commanding general  and also in  the return of the respondent.</p>
<p> It is equally clear that  the certificate of General Davis of date the 18th day of February, 1903,  is in compliance with Act No. 272, from which it appears distinctly that the petitioner is a prisoner committed by  a military commission prior  to October  1, 1901; and further that he is a prisoner arrested and held for trial  before October 15, 1901, for a violation of the laws of war committed  before the same date.</p>
<p> We think the certificate of the commanding general is in strict compliance with the provisions of the law, and was a conclusive return to the writ  of <em>habeas corpus</em>.</p>
<p> The  power of the court to either, issue the writ  or discharge the prisoner is ended when such return has been made and the proceedings must there end.</p>
<p> While the power conceded to the commanding general is of vital importance and an abuse of it would be attended with great evil, still, the high position of those to whom it has  been confided was doubtless believed to be a sufficient guaranty that it would not be exercised except after careful investigation and with a due appreciation  of the delicate nature of the  power reposed in  the commanding general by the legislative authority.</p>
<p> In view of the disposition which the law requires us to make of the case it is unnecessary to discuss other interesting questions raised  by counsel for the petitioner.<br>
  <br>
  The  order and  decision of the judge  of the Court of First Instance of Manila  ordering that  the prisoner be discharged  from  custody  of  the  respondent must  be reversed,  the  proceedings  dismissed,  and the  prisoner remanded to  the  custody  of the respondent.   It  is  so ordered and  directed.   Costs of proceedings will be adjudged against the petitioner.</p>
<p> <em> Torres, Willard, Mapa,</em> and <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p> <em>Arellano, C. J.,</em> did not sit in this case.</p>
