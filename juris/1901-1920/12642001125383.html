				<H3>THE MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL ET AL., DEFENDANTS. MAURO PRIETO, APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This was an action brought by the plaintiff, The Manila Railroad  Company, in the Court of First  Instance of the Province  of Laguna for the  purpose of condemning certain parcels of land which the  plaintiff company desired to use in  the extension of its railway line from  Calamba to Santa Cruz, a distance of some 22 miles.  The petition sets out that among other concessions granted to the plaintiff company by Act No.  1510 of the Philippine Commission is the right to construct this branch line from  Calamba  to Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>At the time of the institution of this action there were fifty-two parties defendant, but prior to the rendering  of the judgment herein the claims of many of the defendants were settled, and since the rendering of the judgment all other claims, with the exception of those of the defendant Mauro Prieto, have been satisfactorily adjusted, so that  of the original fifty-two  defendants Prieto is the only remaining party defendant to this  appeal.</p>
<p>Both parties asked for the appointment of commissioners to value the land  and the improvements which  were the subject of the condemnation proceedings; and the trial court, in accordance with the provisions of section 243 of Act No. 190  of  the  Philippine Commission, appointed  as commissioners  W.  A. McVean,  Julian Pi√±on, and Hermenegildo Aquino.  These commissioners accepted their appointments as such and proceeded to the discharge of their duties. They held sessions in the village of Los Banos, made personal inspections of the lands which were the subject of the condemnation proceedings, heard both parties  as to their respective claims,  examined a large number of witnesses, and in due time rendered to the court a full and complete report of all their proceedings together with the conclusions at which they had arrived.   With some slight modifications the majority  report of the commissioners was  approved by the court and formed the basis of the judgment rendered herein.  Both parties are now before this court as appellants from that judgment.</p>
<p>The valuations fixed for the land involved in this action form no part of the issues on this appeal.  The only question brought up  for consideration here is the value of  certain mejoras (improvements) which are alleged to have been either destroyed or used by the agents and employees of the plaintiff company.  The record shows, and it is not questioned,  that the defendant was a tenant of a large tract of land belonging to the Insular Government an4 known as the Hacienda de los Frailes, and that as such tenant  and by virtue of a waiver by the Government of its claim to compensation in his favor, he is entitled to compensation for the value of the mejoras (improvements) on the land held by him as tenant and condemned  in favor of the plaintiff company.</p>
<p>The <em>mejoras</em>  (improvements)  on  the tract of land  in
question consisted  largely  of plants and  trees, such as <em>naranjitos</em>, abacas, platanos, and trees of many other varieties.  The damages and injuries complained of were classified under four different heads, as  follows:</p>
<blockquote><table width="100%" border="0">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td>1.  Damages done by the surveyors and engineers of the
  plaintiff ..........................................................................</td>
    <td>P665.00</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2. Improvements destroyed in making the embankments and
  fills  of the roadbed......................................................</td>
    <td>17,828.00</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3.  Improvements destroyed by Are alleged to have been
  caused by agents and employees of plaintiff......................... </td>
    <td>1,950.00</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4.  Improvements destroyed  along the  side of the roadbed  ................................................................................... </td>
    <td>3,283.00</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table></blockquote>
<p>In  addition to the above  items there was a claim for P400, for money which  defendant claimed he paid out in clearing and preparing for cultivation certain tracts of the land which were thereafter occupied and appropriated by the  plaintiff  company.  The  total   amount  of damages claimed by the defendant was P24,126.50.   The majority report of the commissioners fixed the value of the improvements,  and  awarded  the amount  of damages which the defendant should receive at P19,478.  This amount  was reduced by the lower court to P16,778.</p>
<p>The plaintiff's contention is that the amount of damages awarded is grossly excessive and unjust and that the amount awarded in  the report  of the commissioners should  have been reduced  by at least P17,000.  The defendant urges that the proof showed the damages to have been crreater than those allowed by the commissioners and the court, and that the award of damage should conform to the proof.</p>
<p>The only ground upon which the plaintiff company bases its contention  that the valuations are excessive is the minority report of one of the commissioners. The values assigned to some of the improvements may be  excessive but we are not prepared to say that such is the case.  Certainly there is no evidence  in the record which  would justify us in holding these values to be grossly excessive.  The commissioners in their report go into rather minute detail as to the reasons for the conclusions reached and the valuations fixed for the various items included therein.  There was sufficient evidence before the commissioners to support.the valuations fixed by them except only those later modified by the court below.  The trial court was of opinion that the price of P2 each  which was fixed for  the  orange trees (<em>naranjitos</em>) was excessive, and this was reduced to F1.50 for each tree; this on the ground that the evidence discloses that these, trees were comparatively young at the time of the expropriation,  and that the value fixed by  the majority report of  the  commissioners  was that  of full-grown  or nearly full-grown trees.  We are of opinion  that this reduction was just and reasonable.  Aside from the evidence taken into consideration by the trial judge we find no evidence in the record  in support of the contention  of  the railroad  plaintiff that the  valuations fixed in  the majority report of the  commissioners and  by the  trial  court  are .grossly  excessive,  and plaintiff company having  wholly failed to offer evidence in support of its allegations iii this regard when the opportunity so to do was provided in accordance with  law, it  has no  standing in this court  to demand a new  trial based on its unsupported allegations of grossly excessive valuation of the property by the commissioners and the court below.   (Philippine Railway Co. <em>vs.</em> Solon, 13 Phil.  Rep., 34.)</p>
<p>The item of damages amounting to P1,950, which relates to the destruction of  improvements on lands adjoining the condemned lands and which is alleged to have been caused by fire, was not, in our opinion, a proper item for the consideration of the commissioners.  Section  244 of Act No. 190,  which relates to the duties  of the commissioners  in condemnation proceedings, provides among other things  as follows: "The commissioners shall assess the value of the property taken and used  *   *  *."  The  other provisions of this article relate to the question of consequential  damages  and benefits.  The land on  which the <i> mejoras   </i>(improvements) alleged  to have been destroyed by fire  were located, was not property taken and used  by the plaintiff company for  the construction of  its railway line.  If the plaintiff is  liable for this item of damages  such liability cannot be enforced in these proceedings.  It  was error on the part of the trial court to take this item of damage into consideration in fixing its judgment.  The trial court,  however, reduced the amount of damage caused  by the fire  from P1,950 to P1,500  since  there was included  in this  item 900 orange  trees (<em>naranjitos</em>) and the price allowed for these trees was P1.50 for each tree instead of P2.</p>
<p>For the reasons already stated we think  that no part of the damages which are alleged to have resulted from the negligent or willful acts  of the agents of the company in setting fire  to the <i>mejoras </i>(improvements)  on lands adjoining the lands actually condemned should have been considered or allowed in  these proceedings, and the judgment of the lower court awarding P16,778 as the amount of damages to be paid to the defendant should therefore be reduced by Pl,500, this latter  sum being the amount of these damages which  was included in the judgment.   Modified by substituting damages to the amount of P15,278 instead of P16,778, as  allowed by the court below, the judgment entered below is affirmed without costs to either party in this instance.</p>
