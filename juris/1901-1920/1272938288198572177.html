				G.R. No. 11962, August 27, 1918</h4>
				<H3>PHILIP C. WHITAKER, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. JAMES J. RAFFERTY, AS COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The only question presented by this appeal is whether or not the appellee is 
a merchant and is therefore liable to pay the internal revenue tax imposed and 
collected by the Collector of Internal Revenue. The tax in question was paid 
under protest.
<p>The facts important for a decision of that question are not in dispute. They 
are admitted and may be briefly stated as follows:</p>
<p>That on the first day of June, 1914, the appellee entered into a contract 
with "La Corporacion de Padres Agustinos Recoletos de la Provincia de San 
Nicolas de Tolentino en Filipinas," by virtue of which a contract of lease 
theretofore entered into between G. W. Daywalt was transferred to plaintiff; 
that said contract of lease granted to him the occupation of a certain 
<em>hacienda</em> or farm, including the cattle thereon; that on the 31st day of 
March, 1915, the plaintiff sold 1,000 head of the cattle acquired as a part of 
the lease of said <em>hacienda</em>, to one Ricardo E. Barretto. The Collector 
of Internal Revenue required the plaintiff to pay the merchandise tax upon the 
value of the sale of said cattle in accordance with the provisions of section 40 
of Act No. 2339.</p>
<p>While it is admitted that the appellee owned and operated another farm 
besides the one from which the cattle in question were sold, and produced cattle 
and other classes of animals thereon, and sold some of said cattle upon the 
other farm from time to time, such sales were for the purpose of clearing his 
herds of undesirable stock.</p>
<p>Section 40 of Act No. 2339 provides for a percentage tax on the sales of all 
merchandise. It provides that all merchants not herein specifically exempted 
shall pay a tax of one-third of one per cent on the gross value in money of the 
commodities, goods, wares and merchandise sold, bartered or exchanged by 
them.</p>
<p>Paragraph 3 of the same section defines who is merchant as that term is used 
in said section (section 40). The definition of a merchant as therein given is, 
" 'Merchant,' as here used, means a person engaged in the sale, barter, or 
exchanged of personal property of whatever character."</p>
<p>We are bound by that definition. The definition of lexicographers of the word 
"merchant" furnishes us with no aid in determining its exact meaning as used in 
said section. It is a statutory definition.</p>
<p>From said section it will be seen that a "merchant" in order to be subjected 
to the necessity of paying the tax, must be "engaged in the sale, barter, or 
exchange of personal property." The words in said section which are important 
for a proper understanding of the same are, "engaged," "sale," "barter," and 
"exchange." By the definition which the law gives us, a person to be a merchant 
must be "<em>engaged</em>, etc." To be "engaged" as the word is used here, a 
person must be <em>occupied</em> or <em>employed</em> in the sale, barter, etc., 
of personal property. We can hardly say that a person is <em>occupied</em> or 
<em>employed</em> in the sale, barter or exchange of personal property when he 
has made one purchase and sale only.</p>
<p>A person who buys an automobile today and sells it tomorrow, because he has 
no further use for it, or because it no longer suits his convenience to keep it, 
can hardly be "engaged" in the sale, barter or exchange of personal property. We 
are not of the opinion that a person who comes into the possession of a farm, 
together with animals thereon, as purchaser or tenant, and sells such animals 
for the purpose of clearing his herd of undesirables and for other reasons, can 
be regarded as a merchant "engaged" in the sale, barter or exchange of personal 
property.</p>
<p>The proof in the present case fails to show that the plaintiff is a merchant 
engaged in the sale, barter, or exchange of personal property. The tax collected 
was therefore illegally collected and the plaintiff is entitled to a recovery of 
the same. Therefore, the judgment of the lower court is hereby affirmed, with 
costs. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Street, Malcolm</em>, and <em>Fisher, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p></div>
