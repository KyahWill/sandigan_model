				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This defendant was charged with a violation of article 28 of the Municipal 
Code.
<p>From the record it appears that on the 29th day of September, 1916, the 
deputy prosecuting attorney of the Province of Albay presented a complaint in 
the court of justice of the peace, charging the defendant with a violation of 
article 28 of Act No. 82, Upon said complaint the defendant was arrested and a 
preliminary examination was duly held. On the 2d day of December, 1916, the said 
justice of the peace found that there was probable cause for believing that the 
defendant was guilty of the crime charged and ordered him to be held for trial 
in the Court of First Instance. On the 14th day of December, 1916, the deputy 
prosecuting attorney for said province renewed said complaint in the Court of 
First Instance. Upon said complaint the defendant was duly arrested, tried, 
found guilty of the crime charged in the complaint, and sentenced by the 
Honorable Isidro Paredes to be imprisoned for six months and to pay the costs. 
From that sentence the defendant appealed to this court.</p>
<p>At the time mentioned in the complaint the defendant was one of the 
councilmen of the municipality of Ligao, of the Province of Albay. Sometime in 
the month of April, 1916, the authorities of the municipality of Ligao 
authorized the construction of certain streets and entered into contracts 
therefor. Nominally said contracts were made with one Ramon Nieves. For the 
construction of one of said streets the municipality promised to pay the sum of 
P246.25. Later, contracts were made with certain laborers for the performance of 
the labor necessary upon said street. The proof shows that the contract with 
said laborers was made between them and the defendant herein; that the defendant 
paid them the amount agreed upon, which was the sum of P80 for said labor; that 
the defendant paid them the price for said services from time to time. The 
record further shows that the said Ramon Nieves was simply the nominal 
contractor with said municipality for the construction of said street,, while, 
as a matter of fact, the defendant was the real contractor; that Ramon Nieves 
received from the defendant the sum of P5 for allowing his name to be used as 
the contractor instead of that of the defendant.</p>
<p>The appellant complains that the lower court disregarded the declaration of 
Ramon Nieves during the trial of the cause. In view of the fact that Ramon 
Nieves had made a written confession before the trial of the cause (Exhibit A) 
that he was not the real contractor but that the defendant was, the court 
committed no error in disbelieving him when he declared to the contrary during 
the trial of the cause. Ramon Nieves discredited his own testimony by making the 
contrary statements. The evidence shows beyond a reasonable doubt that the 
defendant is guilty of a violation of said article of the Municipal Code.</p>
<p>The sentence being within the provisions of said Code, we find no reason for 
changing or modifying it. The sentence of the lower court is, therefore, hereby 
affirmed, with costs. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Carson, Araullo, Street</em>, and <em>Malcolm, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p></div>
