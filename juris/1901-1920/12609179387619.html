				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This defendant was a member of the Philippines Constabulary and  was charged with the crime of sleeping on duty.  The  court below, after an  examination of the evidence  adduced  during the  trial, found  the  defendant guilty of said offense and  sentenced him to be imprisoned for a period of one year and to pay a fine of 300 pesos and to suffer, in case of insolvency, subsidiary imprisonment at the  rate of one day for each 12Â½ pesetas, and to pay the costs.  From this decision the defendant appealed to this court.</p>
<p>An examination of the evidence ackluced during the trial of the  cause  in the court below is sufficient to justify the finding of facts that the defendant did sleep while  on duty on the night of the 8th of  March, 1905.   However, taking into consideration all of the facts  contained in the record submitted to this court, we  are of the opinion that imprisonment for a period of three months and a fine of 50 pesos is sufficient  penalty for the offense of which the defendant is guilty.   The defendant was  tried and convicted under the provisions of section 8 of  Act No. 619 of the Philippine Commission.   Said section  provides:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Any member of the Constabulary who, while on duty as a sentinel, is found sleeping upon his post, or who leaves it before he is regularly relieved, shall be fined  not exceeding five hundred dollars or imprisoned not exceeding one year, or both."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The inferior court imposed subsidiary imprisonment upon the defendant in case  of insolvency.  There  is no provision for subsidiary imprisonment in the. act creating the crime  with which the defendant was  charged.  The provisions of the Spanish Penal Code, still in force in these Islands with reference to subsidiary  imprisonment, have no application to crimes created by acts of the Commission. That part  of the sentence of the inferior court which imposes subsidiary imprisonment is therefore hereby reversed.</p>
<p>It is the judgment of this court that the sentence of the inferior court be modified and that the defendant be sentenced to be imprisoned for a period of three months and to pay a fine of 50 pesos and the costs.</p>
<p>After  the expiration of ten days  let  this cause be remanded  to the inferior court for the execution of the foregoing decision.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Carson,</em> and <em>Willard, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
