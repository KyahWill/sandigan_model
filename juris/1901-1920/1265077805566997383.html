				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>After a careful review of all 
the evidence of record, we find nothing which would justify us in disturbing the 
findings of fact by the trial judge upon which is based his judgment in favor of 
the plaintiff for P4,990.46, the value of certain property wrongfully and 
forcibly taken by the defendants and appellants from plaintiff's store in 
Dumanhug, which property has long since been destroyed or consumed. The 
contentions of counsel for defendants and appellants in this connection are 
sufficiently and satisfactorily disposed of in the opinion of this court in the 
case of Aldamis <em>vs.</em> Leuterio (8 Phil. Rep., 688, 691), and the cases 
there cited, Williams <em>vs.</em> Bruffy (96 U. S., 176); Stevens <em>vs.</em> 
Griffith (111 U. S., 48); Baldy<em> vs.</em> Hunter (171 U. S., 388). The 
principles announced in the former case are clearly applicable to the case at 
bar and decisive of it, so that, adhering to the doctrine therein announced, the 
judgment of the court below should be and is affirmed on this branch of the 
case.</p>
<p>We cannot, however, agree with the trial judge, in his finding that it was 
necessary for the plaintiff to pay the sum of P2,850 Mexican currency to the 
Compañia General de Tabacos (referred to hereinafter as the company) in order to 
recover possession of certain tobacco which was unlawfully and forcibly seized 
by the defendants and which thereafter came into the possession of that company. 
We have no doubt that plaintiff did in fact pay over that amount to the company 
in order to secure possession of the tobacco, but we think it is very clear from 
all the evidence of record, that there was no legal necessity therefor. In other 
words, upon the evidence as developed by the record in this case, the plaintiff 
was entitled to recover and by the institution of the proper action might have 
recovered his tobacco from the company without the necessity for making payment 
therefor. Upon the plaintiffs own showing he was wrongfully and forcibly 
dispossessed of the tobacco which came into the possession ,of the company, and 
in the light of the facts as disclosed by this record he had a perfect right to 
recover possession of his property from the company, without the payment of any 
indemnity whatever. It is not even suggested in the record that the payment of 
this money was rendered necessary by the threatened or actual insolvency of the 
company or for any other reason whatever which could have justified the payment 
under protest, in order to avoid loss and damage to an amount still greater than 
that paid to the company.<br><br>The trial judge rendered judgment in favor of 
the plaintiff and against the defendants for the amount thus paid to the 
company, and the judgment must therefore be reversed to that extent. It is 
admitted that the plaintiff recovered Jill the tobacco which was unlawfully 
seized by the defendants, and the measure of his damages arising out of the 
transaction, for which they could properly be held responsible in a civil 
action, is compensation for the wrongful detention, together with his necessary 
and reasonable expenditures incurred in his efforts to recover possession. (38 
Cyc, 2101, and cases there cited.) There is no evidence in the record as to loss 
or damage of this nature, except the evidence touching the payment to the 
company, and it appearing that there was no reasonable or legal necessity for 
the payment of the amount in question in order to recover possession of the 
tobacco, we are of opinion that plaintiff is not entitled to reimbursement 
therefor from these defendants. To hold otherwise would put it in the power of 
the injured party in cases such as that at bar, to augment the damages suffered 
by him to any extent which malice or a willful disregard of the rights of the 
offender might dictate, and would open the door to fraud in all such cases. To 
allow the owner of property who has been wrongfully deprived of possession to 
pile up expenses for the alleged purpose of recovering the property, which are 
not reasonable and necessary to that end, and to recover as damages the amount 
of such expenditures, would in many instances work a greater wrong than that 
originally committed. Such expenditures can in no proper sense be held to have 
been occasioned by the wrongful act of the trespasser, whose liability is 
limited to the repair of the damage resulting from such wrongful act.</p>
<p>Let judgment be entered affirming the judgment in all respects, except as to 
so much thereof as allows damages (<em>daños y perjuicios</em>) in the sum of 
P2,850, and reversing so much thereof as allows the said damages, without 
special condemnation of costs in this instance.</p>
<p><em>Moreland, Trent,</em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J.,</em> concurs to the extent that the judgment should be 
affirmed in full.<br></p></div>
