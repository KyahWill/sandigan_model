				<H3>RAMON SANTOS, PETITIONER, VS. E. FINLEY JOHNSON, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MANILA, RESPONDENT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is a petition for a writ of mandamus against the defendant judge, who refused to certify a bill of exceptions in the case of Santos  <em>vs</em>. Gonzalez.</p>
<p>The defendant judge in his testimony said: &quot;That he closed the November term of the Court of First Instance of the Province of Pangasinan without fixing the date when it should be continued, on the 20th of December, 1902; that he did not hear anything more about the case of Santos <em>vs</em>. Gonzalez until the middle  of March, 1903, when, as he remembered, one Mr. Knudson, who represented himself to be an employee of the office of  Mr. Charles Cohn of the city of Manila, appeared in his office, in part 1 of the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila,  with a sealed package addressed to Hon. A. F. Odlin, Lingayen, Province of Pangasinan; that the  said Mr.  Knudson stated to the undersigned that  Mr.  Cohn had asked him to  mail  the said package, stating at the same time that it contained the bill of exceptions in the case of Santos <em>vs</em>. Gonzalez, but that he (Knudson) was of the  opinion  that  the said  bill  of exceptions should be presented to this defendant  *  *  *; that the  defendant did not hear anything more concerning the preparation and certification of the said bill  of exceptions until the 21st or 22d of April, 1903, and that at that time Mr. Cohn appeared personally  before the defendant, who was then acting as judge of the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, and asked the defendant to  certify as to the correctness of the document which he then presented and which purported to be the bill of exceptions in the case  of Santos <em>vs</em>.  Gonzalez; that the defendant, after considering the same,  then  and there refused to sign the alleged bill of exceptions, for the reason that he was  of the opinion that he had no authority  under the law to sign and certify the said bill of exceptions, because he was not then acting in the district  where the case of  Santos <em>vs</em>. Gonzalez was tried and was not at that time judge of the Court of First Instance of said province in the district in which the case was instituted and decided.&quot;   (Record, pp. 192 and  193.)</p>
<p>It appearing that the  defendant judge was not at that time the  judge of the province  in question, we hold that he properly refused to sign and certify the bill of exceptions presented to him in a case which he had tried.  The certification and signing of a bill of exceptions are jurisdictional acts which can not be executed by one who has no jurisdiction over the matter on account of his having ceased to be the judge of the court in which  the case was tried by him as such judge.   He has no right  to exercise any jurisdiction in a court of which he has ceased to be the judge.  It has, been so held by this  court in Enriquez <em>vs</em>.  Watson,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> No. 1561; Kicamora <em>vs</em>.  Trent,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> No.  1534; Osme√±a  <em>vs</em>.  Gorordo,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> No. 1746.</p>
<p>We accordingly  deny the petition for a writ of mandamus, with the  costs to  the petitioner.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Mapa, Carson, Willard,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<em>Johnson, J.,</em> disqualified.<br />
