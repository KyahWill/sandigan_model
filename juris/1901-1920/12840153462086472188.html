				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This defendant was charged with the crime of <em>robo con lesiones</em>. He 
was duly arrested, arraigned, tried and found guilty, at first, of the crime of 
<em>tentativa de robo en cuadrilla </em>and sentenced to be imprisoned for a 
period of six months of <em>arresto mayor</em>, and to pay the offended person 
the sum of P6, the amount which the latter had paid in being cured of the wound 
which he had received from the defendant at the time of the commission of the 
crime. Immediately after the sentence, the defendant presented a motion for a 
new trial which was granted; and a new trial was had upon the 19th day of 
February, 1916. At the close of the second trial, and after a consideration of 
the evidence adduced, the lower court found the defendant guilty of the crime of 
<em>robo en cuadrilla con lesiones</em> and sentenced him to be imprisoned for a 
period of six months of <em>arresto mayor</em>, and to pay to the offended 
person the sum of P6 and costs, and in case of insolvency, to suffer subsidiary 
imprisonment in accordance with the provisions of the law. From that sentence 
the defendant appealed to this court.
<p>The only error assigned by the appellant is that the proof adduced during the 
trial of the cause does not show that he is guilty of the crime charged.</p>
<p>During the second trial a number of witnesses testified. The fact that on the 
night of the 3d day of August, 1915, four persons entered the house of Miguel 
Caindoy is not denied. Neither is the fact denied that at the time the four 
persons entered the house of Caindoy there were present himself, his wife and 
his child. Miguel Caindoy testified that he and his wife and his child on the 
night in question were eating their evening meal; that four persons entered his 
house; that two of them immediately attacked him and wounded him; that the other 
two took and carried out of his house a trunk which contained clothing and other 
articles; that the trunk was left just outside of the house and was later 
recovered. All of these facts are supported by the declarations of his wife. The 
only disputed fact is one relating to the identity of the defendant and 
appellant. The record shows that Miguel Caindoy, immediately after the robbers 
had escaped, went to the house of the <em>teniente</em> of the barrio to make a 
report of the occurrence. Miguel Caindoy testified that he gave the name of the 
defendant to the teniente of the barrio as one of the persons who took part in 
the robbery. That fact is denied by the <em>teniente</em> of the barrio. Miguel 
Caindoy and his wife each testified that they recognized the defendant at the 
time he entered the house, because they had known him a long time; that there 
was a light in the house; and that by means of the light they recognized the 
defendant. Luis Navales, a neighbor of Miguel Caindoy, testified that at about 8 
o'clock on the night in question, he passed by the house of Miguel Caindoy 
carrying a light and saw two persons with a trunk and at the same time saw two 
other persons coming out of the door of the house of the offended person; that 
one of the two who came out of the door was the defendant; that he positively 
recognized the defendant as one of the two persons; that he had known the 
defendant prior to that time; that immediately the four persons ran away leaving 
the trunk near the house of Miguel Caindoy. The record further shows that Miguel 
Caindoy, on the following day, met the defendant in a <em>tienda</em> near his 
house and then and there accused him of having taken part in the said robbery. 
Of course, if Miguel Caindoy and his wife did in fact recognize the defendant as 
one of the four robbers at the time of the commission of the crime, and if, in 
fact, Caindoy did not give the name of the defendant to the <em>teniente</em> of 
the barrio, that would raise some doubt upon the question of the identification. 
Miguel Caindoy during the trial swore positively that he did give to the 
<em>teniente</em> of the barrio the name of the defendant as one of the robbers. 
The <em>teniente</em> of the barrio denied that fact. However, we have the 
undisputed testimony of the wife of Caindoy that she recognized the defendant at 
the time of the commission of the robbery. We have the testimony of Luis Navales 
who, so far as the record is concerned, is a disinterested party, who also 
testified positively that he recognized the defendant as one of the two persons 
whom he saw running out of the house of Caindoy. Discarding, therefore, the 
testimony of Miguel Caindoy, we have the undisputed testimony of two witnesses 
to the effect that they recognized the defendant as one of the four persons who 
committed the robbery charged in the complaint.</p>
<p>The lower court found the defendant guilty of <em>robo en cuadrilla con 
lesiones</em>. The only proof adduced during the trial of the cause showing the 
existence of the <em>cuadrilla</em> was obtained from Miguel Caindoy who was 
called by the judge as a witness after the prosecution and defense had closed 
their proof. He testified that the four persons who entered his house were armed 
with <em>bolos</em>. The Attorney-General is not inclined to accept that 
declaration as positive proof of the existence of the <em>cuadrilla</em>. He was 
led to that conclusion evidently from the fact that none of the witnesses during 
their principal examination made any statement concerning the fact that the four 
men were armed. If they had been armed with bolos it would have been most 
natural for the offended party to mention that fact as one of the principal 
facts. No mention whatever was made of that fact until after the evidence had 
been closed and not then until after the judge himself had recalled the witness 
for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not the robbers were armed. 
Considering the argument of the Attorney-General in relation with the facts just 
stated, we are inclined to agree with him in his conclusion, to wit, that the 
crime committed was <em>robo simple con lesiones.</em></p>
<p>It will be remembered that the provincial fiscal described the offense with 
which the defendant was charged in the complaint as that of <em>robo con 
lesiones</em>. The question might be presented: Upon what theory did the lower 
court find the defendant guilty of the crime of <em>robo en cuadrilla con 
lesiones</em> under said complaint? An examination of the body of the complaint 
presented shows that the defendant was accused "in company with three accused, 
and in numbers more than three * * * all armed, and by means of violence upon 
the persons, entered the dwelling house of Miguel Caindoy," etc. If the facts 
alleged in the complaint had been proved during the trial the judge was fully 
justified in finding the defendant guilty of the crime of <em>robo en cuadrilla 
con lesiones</em>. We have frequently decided that in a complaint or information 
filed in a criminal cause, the qualification of the crime is not confined to the 
designation given by the prosecuting attorney in the first part of the complaint 
(the title of the complaint). The crime must be qualified by the description of 
the offense actually given in the body of the complaint. (U. S. <em>vs</em>. 
Supila, 13 Phil. Eep., 671; U. S. <em>vs</em>. Treyes, 14 Phil Rep,, 270; U. S. 
<em>vs</em>. Jeffrey, 15 Phil. Rep., 391; U. S. <em>vs</em>. Lim San, 17 Phil. 
Rep., 273; U. S. <em>vs</em>. De Guzman, 19 Phil. Rep., 350; U. S. <em>vs</em>. 
Campo, 23 Phil. Rep., 368.)</p>
<p>After a careful examination of the evidence, we are of the opinion that the 
evidence adduced during the trial of the cause shows beyond a reasonable doubt 
that the defendant was guilty of the crime of <em>robo con lesiones</em> and 
should be sentenced to be imprisoned, taking into consideration the aggravating 
circumstance of <em>morada</em>, in accordance with the provision of paragraph 5 
of article 503 of the Penal Code, with the penalty of <em>presidio 
correccional</em> in its maximum degree to <em>presidio mayor</em> in its medium 
degree, or with the penalty of imprisonment of eight years and one day. 
Therefore, it is hereby ordered and decreed that the sentence of the lower court 
be revoked and that the defendant and appellant be sentenced to be imprisoned 
for a period of eight years and one day of <em>presidio mayor</em> and to 
indemnify the offended person in the sum of P6, and to pay the costs. So 
ordered.</p>
