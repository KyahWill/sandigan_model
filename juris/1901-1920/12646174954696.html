				<BR><STRONG>MAPA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The defendant was convicted in the court below of the crime of usurpation and condemned to pay a fine of 2,500 pesetas.</p>
<p>Article 521 of the Penal Code, which punishes this crime, provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"He who, by the use of violence or intimidation, shall take possession of any real property or usurp a real right belonging  to another, shall, in addition to the  penalties which he may incur because of the  use of violence, pay a fine equal to from 50 to 100 per cent of the profits which he may have thereby received, but in no case less than 325 pesetas.   If the profit should be such that it is impossible to determine the  amount, then the penalty  shall be a fine of from 325 to  3,250 pesetas."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under this article,  among other  requisites which are essential for the existence of the offense of usurpation, it is necessary that the real property or  the real right, which is supposed to be the object of  this crime, be the property of another.  In the absence  of proof  of  this fact, no conviction can be had upon an information for this offense.</p>
<p>In the present case the evidence for the prosecution deals solely and exclusively with the possession and  not the ownership  of the land alleged to have been usurped by the defendant.  All the testimony for the prosecution tends to show the fact, and nothing more than the fact, that the land  in  question  was  in  possession  of Dofia Carolina Gomez de la Serna and others at the time  of the defendant's forcible entry therein.   Furthermore, it appears that the possessors did not make any claim to the ownership of the said land, but only to its possession.   Dofia Carolina herself says that this land  "does not  belong to anybody," and that, although she is occupying  it, it is only  because she is in possession of it.  There is, therefore, no evidence that the land is the property  of those alleged to have been injured by the offense charged.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the defendant offered to prove, by authentic documents, that he was the lawful owner of the land in question.  This evidence was rejected in the court below.  In this the court erred, for it unquestionably is an error to exclude proof of the ownership  of property in litigation when, as in the  case of usurpation, this ownership constitutes a necessary and indispensable element for the determination of the defendant's guilt or innocence. If the defendant herein had shown that he was the owner of the land in question, there would have been no ground on which he could have  been  convicted  of  the offense charged, because no one can, in  a legal sense, be guilty of the usurpation  of  his own property.  The law  requires that the real property or the real right seized be the property of another, in order that the crime of usurpation may exist.</p>
<p>The error of law into which the court fell in refusing to admit the evidence of ownership offered by the defendant, and against  which ruling the defendant  duly excepted, would be a sufficient ground for remanding the case for a new trial.  We do  not, however, consider it necessary to do this, in view of the fact that the prosecution has not proven that the land alleged to have been usurped was not the property of the defendant.   The burden lay with the prosecution to prove this fact, and, having failed to do so, we must acquit the defendant, even in the  absence of any evidence in  his  behalf,  because of  the presumption of innocence to which every defendant is entitled until proven guilty.</p>
<p>We therefore reverse the judgment appealed and acquit the defendant,  with the costs of both instances <em>de oficio</em>. So ordered.</p>
<p><em> Arellano,   C.  J., Torres,  Cooper,  Willard,</em>  and  <em>McDonough, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em> Johnson, J.,</em> did not sit in this case.</p>
