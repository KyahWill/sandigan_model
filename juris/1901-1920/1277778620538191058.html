				G.R. No. 10080, November 03, 1917</h4>
				<H3>ENRIQUE M. BARRETTO, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. TOMAS CABAÑGIS, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The purpose of the present action was to recover the possession of a certain 
piece or parcel of land described with some degree of particularity in the first 
paragraph of the complaint, together with damages estimated at P105,000 with 
interest and costs.<br><p><br>The defendant answered by a general denial and by a 
special defense. In his special defense the defendant alleged:</p>
<p>"(<em>a</em>) That in certain proceedings instituted and tried in the Court 
of First Instance of the city of Manila, Philippine Islands, civil case No. 
3073, in which Salvadora Ocampo, Luis Abella and Geronimo Abella were 
plaintiffs, and Tomas Cabañgis, the here defendant, was defendant, all and each 
of the questions raised in this case were litigated and judicially 
determined.</p>
<p>"(<em>b</em>) That in the said proceedings the plaintiffs claimed the 
ownership of the same lands described in the complaint of record, basing their 
claim on the same grounds mentioned in the complaint in this record.</p>
<p>"(<em>c</em>) That a copy of the complaint presented in the said previous 
action, dated October 21, 1904, is hereby annexed, marked Exhibit A, and is 
hereby referred to and made an integral part of this answer.</p>
<p>"(<em>d</em>) That in the said proceedings, the defendant, Tomas Cabañgis, 
opposed the said claim of the plaintiffs, submitting the above-mentioned 
question of ownership to the consideration and decision of said Court of First 
Instance of the city of Manila.</p>
<p>"(<em>e</em>) That said court was and is a court of general jurisdiction, 
exercising and enjoying competent jurisdiction over the parties and matter in 
said proceedings.</p>
<p>"(<em>f</em>) That in the said proceedings, after determining the respective 
claims of the parties, said court rendered judgment on the 9th day of February, 
1907, in favor of the plaintiffs. That the defendant appealed from said judgment 
to the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands, which tribunal, by its decision 
rendered on the 28th day of December, 1908, revoked the judgment of the lower 
court as follows, to wit:</p>
<p>" 'Without prejudice to the filing of an extended opinion later, the judgment 
appealed from is hereby reversed and the defendant is absolved from the 
complaint without special finding as to costs, and twenty days hereafter let 
judgment be entered in conformity herewith, and ten days later let the record be 
returned to the court wherein it originated, for appropriate action. So 
ordered.'</p>
<p>"(<em>g</em>) That thereafter, to wit, on January 16, 1909, the 20 days 
specified in the aforesaid decision having expired, judgment was entered by the 
said Supreme Court in conformity therewith, a copy of which judgment is attached 
hereto, marked Exhibit B, and made a part of this answer."</p>
<p>In addition to the foregoing defense the defendant further set up the defense 
of prescription, alleging—</p>
<p>"That during more than thirty years last past, or since the year 1843, the 
defendant and his immediate predecessors in interest have been and now are in 
the actual, uninterrupted, open, public, and continuous possession of the land 
above described, under claim of absolute title thereto, and exclusive of any 
other right and adverse to all other claimants."</p>
<p>Upon the issue thus presented the cause was brought on for trial on the 18th 
day of July, 1912. After hearing the evidence the lower court rendered a 
judgment, the dispositive part of which is as follows:</p>
<p>"It is accordingly considered and adjudged that plaintiff take nothing by his 
complaint, and that defendant recover his costs."</p>
<p>From that judgment the plaintiff appealed to this court.</p>
<p>"The appellant makes two assignments of error as follows:</p>
<p>"1. The trial court erred in holding that the matter in litigation was 
<em>res adjudicata</em>.</p>
<p>"2. The trial court erred in not rendering decision in favor of appellant on 
the merits."</p>
<p>In relation to the first assignment of error it may be said:</p>
<p>First. That the plaintiff admits that he is the successor in interest of the 
said Salvadora Ocampo, Luis Abella, and Geronimo Abella, mentioned in the answer 
of the defendant.</p>
<p>Second. The record shows that the land in question in this particular case is 
identically the same land which was litigated between the said Ocampo et al. and 
the said Tomas Cabañgis in case No. 3073 of the Court of First Instance (R. G. 
No. 3983 of the Supreme Court.)<span class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span></p>
<p>Third. The record shows that in that case (No. 3073, Court of First Instance, 
and No. 3983 of the Supreme Court) it was held that the plaintiffs were without 
right to the possession of the parcel of land in question.</p>
<p>Fourth. The record further shows (Exhibit ZZ) that during the pendency of 
said other action (R. G. No. 3983) the plaintiff herein purchased the said 
parcel of land from the said plaintiffs in that action, Ocampo et al., that at 
the time of said purchase, which was three days after the promulgation of the 
decision in the first case (R. G. No. 3983) and before it became final, the 
plaintiff herein had full knowledge of the existence of the litigation then 
pending between the said Ocampo et al. and the defendant herein, as will more 
fully appear by the following, which is a copy of the transfer of said property 
to the plaintiff herein:</p>
<p>"In consideration of the agreed price in the contract of this same date and 
in view of the fact that Enrique M. Barretto, a resident of this city, is 
willing to defray all<br>the expenses and costs which heretofore may be incurred 
in the action which, under No. 3983 of the general register of the Supreme Court 
of these Islands, we are engaged in against Tomas Cabañgis—the latter being the 
defendant and appellant, and we the plaintiffs and appellee—<em>we solemnly 
declare</em> by these presents that we assign and convey to the said Enrique M. 
Barretto, his heirs and assigns, all our rights or those which we may exercise 
in the referred action as to our ownership over a piece of land in the barrio of 
Vitas, in the district of Tondo, Manila, which was acquired through purchase 
from the Augustinian friars by our predecessor in interest, Luis Abella y Rojo, 
now deceased; and</p>
<p>"By virtue of this assignment and conveyance, we authorize the said Enrique 
M. Barretto to continue the said action Phil. Rep., 626. against the said Tomas 
Cabangis, to appeal it, if necessary, to the Supreme Court of the United States, 
as well as to compromise it if he finds it convenient to his interests; all to 
be done at his own account and risk and without any further liability on our 
part. Should the ownership and possession of said land be decreed in our favor, 
it shall be understood to have been done so in behalf of the said Enrique M. 
Barretto.</p>
<p>"In witness whereof, We have signed this document, in Manila, Philippine 
Islands, this 29th day of December, 1909.</p>

<p>Fifth. That the present plaintiff, even though he became the owner of 
whatever interest Ocampo et al. had in the land in question before the decision 
in case R. G. No. 3983 became final, did not have himself substituted in their 
stead in said litigation, but, upon the contrary, permitted further proceedings 
to be had, with full knowledge thereof, in that case in the name of Ocampo et 
al.</p>
<p>Sixth. That while the plaintiff herein purchased the parcel of land in 
question with full knowledge of the pendency of the litigation between his 
vendors and the defendant herein, and while he made no effort to be substituted 
instead of his vendors, and while he permitted certain proceedings to be had 
after the date of his purchase in the name of Ocampo et al., and while the 
decision in that case became final upon the 18th day of January, 1909, he did 
not commence the present action until the month of November, 1911.</p>
<p>The decision in the former case (R. G. No. 3983) was promulgated upon the 
26th day of December, 1909. The defendant with full knowledge that it had been 
declared that Ocampo et al. were without right or title in the lands in 
question, purchased the same upon the 29th day of December, 1909. He is, 
therefore, the successor in interest of Ocampo et al. with full knowledge that 
his vendors had been declared to have no interest whatever in the land in 
question. He. had full knowledge that the question of the ownership of that land 
had been adjudged and settled. A question decided or passed upon by a court of 
competent jurisdiction is received as evidence of truth. The question of the 
ownership of the land in question had been settled before the present plaintiff 
became the owner thereof, of which fact he had full knowledge. He is, therefore, 
bound by the result of the former litigation and cannot be permitted again to 
litigate that question.</p>
<p>With reference to the second assignment of error the record contains a large 
preponderance of evidence showing that the defendant and his predecessors had 
occupied the parcel of land in question for about fifty years, quietly, 
peaceably and without interruption.</p>
<p>After a careful examination of the record, and without discussing at greater 
length the authorities cited by the appellant against the application of the 
doctrine of <em>res adjudicata,</em> we are of the opinion and so decide that 
the judgment of the lower court should be affirmed, with costs.So ordered.</p>
