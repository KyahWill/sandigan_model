				<H3>FRANCISCA  SIMON, PETITIONER, VS. CLAUDIA CASTRO AND IRENE CASTRO, RESPONDENTS.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>In the  month of February, 1904, Claudia Castro and Irene Castro commenced ah action in the Court of First Instance of Pampanga against Francisca Simon and Jose de Castro. The summons in that action was duly served upon Francisca Simon on the 10th day of February, 1904. Within the time required therefor by law she duly entered an appearance  in the said action and afterwards,  within the time prescribed by the rules, presented a demurrer to the complaint.  This demurrer was overruled and, as we assume, in the order  overruling it a period was fixed within which she might answer the complaint.  She never presented any answer, and judgment was rendered against her on the 3d day of April, 1905, whereof she was duly notified on the 4th day of April of the same year.</p>
<p>Within  sixty days thereafter, and on the 18th day of May, 1905, she presented this petition in this court, asking for the relief provided for in section 513 of the Code of Civil Procedure.  That section is in part as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"When  a judgment is rendered by a Court of First  Instance upon  default,  and  a party thereto  is unjustly deprived of a hearing,by fraud, accident, mistake, or  excusable negligence, and the Court of First Instance which rendered the  judgment has finally adjourned so that no adequate remedy exists in that court, the party so deprived of a hearing may present his petition to the Supreme Court within sixty days after he first learns of the rendition of such judgment, and not thereafter, setting forth the facts and praying to have such judgment set aside  * * *."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the case of Blanco <em>vs</em>.  Guerra, No. 2979, November , 1905 (not reported), it appeared that Blanco and others who were defendants in a suit brought by Guerra against them in the Court of First Instance of Masbate had appeared  and answered, that a day had been fixed for the trial  of the  case, and  that the  lawyer whom they had employed to represent  them had made arrangements to be present at the trial but that he died suddenly as he was about to embark for that island; that the then  defendants knew nothing of his death and by reason thereof they were not represented at the  trial and judgment was rendered against them.  They then filed a  petition in this court, in accordance with the provisions of section 513 of the Code of Civil Procedure.  In deciding  the case this court said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"It appearing that the petitioners,  Blanco, Sendagorta, and Urrutia appeared and answered the complaint: <em>Held</em>, That  section 513 of the Code of Civil Procedure  is not applicable, and m consequence the petition is denied and costs  are adjudged against the petitioner."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In  the case at bar it appears that the petitioner, Francisca  Simon, had  duly appeared in  the action and had presented a demurrer and that the demurrer was overruled. While, by virtue of the provisions of section  101  of the Code  of Civil Procedure, she had a right to answer, she was not bound to do so.  She could stand upon her demurrer if she saw fit.  We do not think that  it can be said that the judgment  which  was rendered thereafter  in accordance with the provisions of section 101 was a judgment rendered by default.  The word "default" as used in section 513 is, we think, the "default" defined in section 128 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p>The petitioner is therefore not entitled to  the relief asked for, and the petition is dismissed with  costs. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Carson,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
