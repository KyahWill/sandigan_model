				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">MALVERSATION OF PUBLIC FUNDS.—From the Court of First Instance of Iloilo. Question as to whether money delivered to a municipal treasurer for internal-revenue stamps, which were never issued by him, becomes by such act public funds or remains the private property of the person delivering the money, not decided, as there was sufficient other money taken, which was without doubt public funds, to warrant his conviction. Judgment affirmed.<br><br>For appellant: W. J. Rohde.<br>For appellee: Attorney-General Araneta.</div>
