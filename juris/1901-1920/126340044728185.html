				<BR><STRONG>TRACEY, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>In  1895  the defendant borrowed from the  Roman Catholic  bishop of the diocese  of Nueva Segovia 2,000 pesos, for which he gave a receipt, not mentioning the bishop but reciting that the money was from the funds of the C of radio, de las Animas  of  the Cathedral of Vigan and providing that it should be repaid with 6 per cent  interest.  At the expiration of a year, the first  installment of interest not being  paid,  the defendant signed a  document  acknowledging  the further advance to  him by the bishop of the amount thereof, 120 pesos, to be added to the  preexisting loan  from the  funds of the <em>cofradia</em>.  He  now  contests the right of the plaintiff, as the Roman Catholic bishop of the diocese, to recover the money loaned by his predecessor in office, claiming that the administration of the funds of a <em>cofradia </em>does not rest with the bishop.   It is not necessary  to discuss this precise question.   The  origin  and general nature of the administration of Roman Catholic church  property in these Islands has recently been lucidly considered in Barlin <em>vs</em>.  Ramirez<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> (5  Off. Gaz., 130).</p>
<p>Whatever may have been his relation to the cofmdia, it is plain the bishop held this fund for its benefit as administrator, and as such  made the loan.   His functions  as administrator passed to his successor in ecclesiastical office. We consider that  it is  not open to the defendant, when the day of payment has  come, to challenge the right which he did not question at the time of borrowing.  From the Roman Catholic  bishop of Nueva Segovia  he  took  the money, and to the  Roman Catholic bishop of  Nueva Segovia he must  repay it, whatever may  have been the title under which the latter held the funds  of the <em>cofradia</em>.</p>
<p>The  judgment appealed from was  taken upon default of the defendant to serve his answer after his demurrer had been overruled.  He neglected to except to the order overruling the  demurrer, of which he ivas  notified on the 7th of January.  Under rule 9 of the Courts of First Instance he was bound within  five days  thereafter  to serve his answer, which, in fact, he duly  made out  and verified  on January 12.  Disregarding the rule, however, he did not attempt to serve it until  the 2d day  of March, when  he deposited  it in the post-office  at Laoag,  expecting it  to be received at Vigan before the opening  of  the term  of court on the 7th  of  that month.   It  Avas in some way delayed, reaching the clerk only on the 13th, and in the meantime  judgment against him had been entered by default.  He moved  for a new trial under  subsection 1  of section 145 of the Code  of Civil Procedure on the ground of accident or surprise.  This motion might have been granted had the delay in the post-office been the only cause of the  nonarrival  of the answer, but  the  defendant has offered no  excuse for his  long  neglect to  serve it for six weeks after the expiration of the legal time, and his laches bar him from relief.</p>
<p>The judge directed  judgment for the plaintiff, without specifying Philippine or other currency.  It is claimed  by the defendant that evidence should have been received  as to the value in Philippine money of the currency loaned, as provided in section 3  of Act No. 1045.</p>
<p>In view  of the  decision of  this court  in  Gaspar <em>vs</em>. Molina<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">(1)</sup> (3 Off. Gaz.,  651), it would be unprofitable  to determine whether soot ion 3 of Act  No. 1045 applies  to a  contract not in terms expressly providing' for  payment in  any  particular  kind  of  currency.   Accepting  that decision without further discussion we  must enforce the rule of <em>stare decisis</em>.   It does not, however, follow  that the trial judge in this  case committed an error.   By the word "pesos" in the judgment of the court below must be underwood "pesos" in the established currency of this country  at  the  time when it  was rendered.  Moreover, the judgment  is valid on its face and the defendant not having moved for a  new trial, on the ground that  it was against the weight of evidence, we  must assume  that the proofs were sufficient to justify it.</p>
<p>The judgment of the  court below is affirmed with costs against the defendant.   After expiration of  twenty days lot judgment be entered in accordance herewith  and ten days thereafter let the  record be remanded  to the court below for proper action.  So ordered.</p>
<em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Johnson,</em> and <em>Willard, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>

<em>DISSENTING</em></div>
<p><strong>CARSON, J.:</strong></p>
<p>I dissent.</p>
<p>I agree with  the foregoing decision, except in so far as it  seems to  hold that when a judgment is  rendered in "pesos" it must in all cases and  at all events be  interpreted to mean pesos Philippine  currency.   While  this may be tin1 general rule, it would appear that when the findings and judgment of the trial court clearly indicate that tlie pesos contemplated (set out) in the judgment are pesos of some other denomination—be it Mexican, Spanish, Brazilian, or Chinese—this  court has no right to interpret the judgment so as to give  it a wholly different meaning from that intended by the court which pronounced it.</p>
<p>In this case,  long before the new Philippine currency came into existence, a large sum of money in <em>plata</em> (the then local currency)  was loaned at (5 per cent interest. The decision of the trial  court, after setting out this fact, concludes by giving judgment for the  exact  number of pesos loaned with 6 per cent interest.   No evidence  was taken to ascertain the relative value of pesos of the class loaned and pesos Philippine currency, and the trial court made no  finding on this point, but  it  is  of public  and universal  knowledge that since the introduction of the  new Philippine currency this relative price has been continually fluctuating,  and that at the date of the demand  as well as at the date of judgment there was a marked difference in the market value of the pesos of the class loaned and pesos Philippine currency.   Under these circumstances, I think that there can he no doubt that the pesos mentioned  in the disposing part of the judgment of the trial court were of the same  class as  those mentioned in the decision  and findings and the original  contract, and not pesos Philippine currency.</p>
I think the  cause  should he sent back for  the  taking of further evidence  as to the relative value of the <em>pesos de  plata</em> set  out  in the  contract and  pesos  Philippine currency,  with instructions  to the lower court  to render judgment accordingly.<br>
