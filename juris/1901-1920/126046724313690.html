				<h4>
				G.R. No. 950, January 23, 1903</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, COMPLAINANT  AND APPELLEE, VS. EMIGDIO MENDIGOREN, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>LADD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> The evidence shows that the defendant was  one of four men who, on  the  evening of a day which the witnesses are not able to fix, in the month of September, 1901, went to the house of Severino del Castillo, in the pueblo of Binalupijan, Province of Bataan,  terrorized the dwellers in the house, and took and carried away a suit of clothes and 10 pesos in  money.</p>
<p> The defense set  up—a  frequent one in this class of cases—is that the defendant was not a voluntary member of the party,  but had  been captured by  the  others and forced to accompany them.   It would require very convincing evidence  in any  case to  establish a defense  of this character, and in the present record we discover nothing which can fairly be said to have even a remote tendency in that direction.</p>
<p> It appears  that two and perhaps  three of the robbers carried arms; as  to  the  fourth—the defendant—the evidence seems to indicate that he was not armed.  The party, therefore, did not constitute a <em>cuadrilla </em>in the sense of the law (art. 505  of the Penal Code; judgment of the supreme court of  Spain of May 22, 1871), and the judgment  of the court below, basing  the conviction upon  the article cited, is so far erroneous.</p>
<p> The defendant is guilty of the crime of <em>robo </em> as defined and punished  in article 503, No. 5, of the Penal Code; the time and place of the commission of the crime  constitute aggravating circumstances (art  10, Nos.  15 and 20); the defendant is accordingly  sentenced to eight years of <em>presidio mayor.</em></p>
<p> The judgment of the court below will be modified in accordance with this opinion, and affirmed in  other respects with costs.  The cause will be remanded to the court below for the execution of the judgment.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C.  J.,  Torres,  Cooper,</em> and  <em>Willard,  JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
