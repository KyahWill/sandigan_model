				<BR><BR><div align="justify">An appeal by the Insular Collector of Customs from a judgment of the Court of 
First Instance of Manila, setting aside the appellant's classification of 
<em>Vino Quina Fer </em>(wine of quinine and iron) and <em>Syrup Quina Fer</em> 
(sirup of quinine and iron) under paragraph 78 (<em>a</em>) of the Philippine 
Tariff Law of 1909, and admitting; the articles free of duty under paragraph 320 
of the same law.
<p>Paragraph 78 (<em>a</em>) reads: "Proprietary and patent medicinal mixtures 
and compounds; Chinese and similar medicines: (a) Without alcohol, or containing 
not to exceed fourteen per centum of alcohol, fifty per centum <em>ad 
valorem.</em>" </p>
<p>The term "proprietary" is defined in section 5 of the above-mentioned law as 
follows: "The term 'proprietary as applied to medicinal remedies, wherever used 
in this Act, shall be held to mean a 'preparation the manufacture or sale of 
which is restricted, through patent of the drug or combination of drugs, 
copyright of the label or name, or any other manner, <em>or a preparation 
concerning which the producer or manufacturer claims a private formula.' "</em> 
</p>
<p>Paragraph 320 reads: "Cinchona bark, sulphate and bisulphate of quinine, 
alkaloids and salts of cinchona bark, in whatever form."</p>
<p>A chemical analysis showed that the wine contained 13.9 per cent alcohol and 
approximately 0.049 per cent quinine, and that the sirup contained 6 per cent 
alcohol and 0.016 per cent quinine. Both contained iron, but in amounts not 
stated. According to the circulars of the manufacturer the beneficial effects 
from both preparations result from the combination of iron and cinchona, the 
wine preparation being for those patients for whom it is more palatable than the 
sirup. This literature of the manufacturer further narrates that the medicinal 
properties of iron and cinchona combined had long been known, but that until 
success had crowned the experiments of Monsieur Laroche, the originator of these 
preparations, no combination had been evolved which could be administered 
without unpleasant effects to the patient. The preparation is sold under a 
distinctive manufacturers' label, and the process of manufacture is claimed to 
be a secret. The chief claim made for it is that it is a tonic; and that such is 
its use was the testimony of Doctor Newberne. Although the cinchona is dissolved 
and combined with the iron in both preparations, it is insisted, for the 
importers, that the general words "in whatever form" used in paragraph 320 of 
the Tariff Act are sufficiently comprehensive to include both of these 
preparations.</p>
<p>The tariff cannot be applied to an imported article by seizing upon one of 
its constituent elements and claiming that the classification of that particular 
element is the classification of the article. Few, indeed, are the articles 
subject to the tariff which are irreducible and indivisible. It has never been 
the practice to analyze an article seeking entry under a tariff act and give to 
each of its constituents that classification which it would have if imported 
alone, let alone classifying the aggregate under the name of one of its parts. 
In the present case, cinchona is a common element to both preparations. So also, 
but in a much larger quantity, is alcohol.</p>
<p>Why should the mixture be called cinchona rather than alcohol? It is 
apparent, however, that neither designation is correct. The question to be 
determined is, What is the article as a whole? This is well illustrated in the 
case of Meyer <em>vs.</em> Arthur (91 U. S., 570; 23 L. ed., 455.) In that case 
the importers asked that certain articles known as white lead, nitrate of lead, 
oxide of zinc, and dry and orange mineral be classified as "all metals not 
herein otherwise provided for, and all manufactures of metals of which either of 
them is the component part of chief value * * *." A chemical analysis of each of 
these preparations disclosed that by far the greater percentage of each 
consisted of one or another minerals.</p>
<p>The court said: "When the Act speaks of 'manufactures of metals,' it 
obviously refers to manufactured articles in which metals form a component part. 
When we speak of manufactures of wood, of leather, or of iron, we refer to 
articles that have those substances respectively for their component parts, and 
not to articles in which they have lost their form entirely, and have become the 
chemical ingredients of new forms * * *. The truth is that, in the nature of 
things, a metal and its oxide or sulphate are totally distinct and unlike. Any 
substance subjected to a chemical change by uniting with another substance loses 
its identity; it becomes a different mineral species. The basis of common clay 
is the metal aluminium, and the basis of lime is the metal calcium. But no one 
would think of calling clay and lime metals; nor, if artificially made, would he 
call them manufactures of metals. They have lost all their metallic qualities. 
In just the same manner, iron ceases to be iron when it becomes rust, which is 
oxide of iron; or when it becomes copperas, which is sulphate of iron. None 
would think of calling blue vitriol copper. So white lead, nitrate of lead, 
oxide of zinc, and dry or orange mineral are not metals; they have no metallic 
qualities. In the poverty of language, they have no distinct names, it is true, 
as lime and clay and vitriol have; but each is designated by a scientific 
periphrasis, in which the name of the metal which forms one of its chemical 
elements is used. This use of the name has probably been one cause of the 
confusion which has arisen on the subject."</p>
<p>For the defendant it is insisted that both of the preparations in question 
should be classified as proprietary medicines under the definition of that term 
in section 5, supra. Both are put up in bottles bearing labels designed with 
considerable care, and have stamped thereon the facsimile signature of Monsieur 
Laroche, all of which conforms with the practice adopted in more recent times by 
the manufacturers of many proprietary and patent medicines which have gained a 
reputation, in order to prevent imitations being sold to the public. All of 
these precautions certainly tend to restrict the sale of the article to that 
prepared by the manufacturers themselves. But, aside from this, it seems clear 
that the preparation falls within the italicized words of section 5, as the 
manufacturer of the preparations under consideration expressly claims that the 
process of manufacture is a secret.</p>
<p>A case analogous to the one at bar was that of Ferguson <em>vs.</em> Arthur 
(117 U. S., 482; 29 L. ed., 979). Calcined magnesia was a well-known medicinal 
preparation, a formula therefor being contained in all the dispensatories. The 
question was whether "Henry's Calcined Magnesia" should be classified as a 
proprietary medicine or as "magnesia, calcined." That "Henry's Calcined 
Magnesia" was universally known by that name and had a character of its own, 
distinctive from the ordinary article, although used for the same purpose; that 
it had been prepared by the same family for one hundred years and sold on the 
market at more than double the price of the American preparation of the highest 
repute; that it had a peculiar reputation on account of the nicety with which it 
was prepared; that each bottle bore a trade-mark and was accompanied with 
literature warning the public against imitations, and claiming that the calcined 
magnesia prepared by them "will be found to be perfectly deprived of carbonic 
acid, free from taste, smell, or other disagreeable property, and without 
roughness or grittiness to the touch or the palate;" were facts held sufficient 
to justify its being called a proprietary medicine.</p>
<p>The preparation now in question is not a mere refinement of the commercial 
article known as cinchona bark or any of its derivatives. Its only claim for 
classification with such drugs is the fact that it contains a small percentage 
thereof. Precautions against imitations and the same claims of special process 
in preparation are made for it as were made for "Henry's Calcined Magnesia."</p>
<p>In Arthur <em>vs.</em> Stephani (96 U. S., 125; 24 L. ed., 771), where the 
question was whether chocolates put up in confectionery form should pay duty as 
confectionery or as chocolate, <em>eo nomine,</em> it was held that the latter 
classification should prevail, after stating the following rule for the 
construction of tariff acts: The case "presents the question whether the 
articles are dutiable under general terms which may embrace them, or under that 
specific language which can be applied to nothing else. That the latter is the 
rule by which the duty is fixed is too well settled to require argument."</p>
<p>In Robertson <em>vs.</em> Salomon (130 U. S., 412; 32 L, ed., 995), the 
Collector of Customs classified "white beans" as "vegetables" under the general 
category of "articles of food." The importers insisted that they should be 
admitted free as seeds, "not otherwise specified." In holding that white beans 
should be classified as "foods" the court disapproved of an instruction to the 
jury below to the effect that "the commercial designation of the article, or 
what the article is called in trade and commerce * * * has nothing to do with 
the question."</p>
<p>The Supreme Court said: "We think the court erred in this instruction. The 
commercial designation, as we have frequently decided, is the first and most 
important designation to be ascertained in settling the meaning and application 
of the tariff laws. (Citing several cases.) But if the commercial designation 
fails to give an article its proper place in the classifications of the law, 
then resort must necessarily be had to the common designation."</p>
<p>In the present case, even on the assumption that the general phrase "in 
whatever form" in paragraph 320 is sufficiently comprehensive to include the 
medicinal preparations in question, it seems clear that the specific language of 
paragraph 78 (a) is also applicable, and must therefore govern under the rule of 
Arthur vs. Stephani, supra. Again, these preparations would undoubtedly be 
termed proprietary medicines by "the trade" and patent medicines or nostrums by 
the public generally.</p>
<p>At the trial, a letter from the Collector of Customs to the Director of 
Science asking for an analysis of the articles in question, and the latter's 
reply, in which it is stated that the .articles should be classified under 
paragraph 320, was admitted in evidence over the objection of the defendant. 
This was manifestly error.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Clearly it is not the province of the expert to act as judge or jury. Hence, 
all questions calling for his opinions should be so framed as not to call upon 
him to determine controverted questions of fact, or to pass upon the 
preponderance of testimony. Thus, it would obviously be improper to ask the 
witness to state his opinion upon all the testimony in the case as to any given 
question, if the truth or part of such evidence were in dispute. When the 
question is so framed as to call upon the expert to determine on which side the 
evidence preponderates or to reconcile conflicting statements, he is in effect 
asked to decide the merits of the case which is a duty wholly beyond his 
province. Whatever liberality may be allowed in calling for the opinions of 
experts or other witnesses, they must <em>not usurp the province of the court 
and jury</em> by drawing those conclusions of law or fact upon which the 
decision of the case depends." (Jones on Evidence, sec. 372.)</p></blockquote>
<p>For the reasons above stated, the judgment appealed from is reversed, and the 
articles in question are held to be dutiable under paragraph 78 (<em>a</em>) of 
the Tariff Act of 1909.</p>
<p>Let judgment be entered accordingly. No costs will be allowed in either 
instance.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Moreland</em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.,</em> concur.<br></p></div>
