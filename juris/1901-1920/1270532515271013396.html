				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">It appears from the record that on the 24th day of July, 1913, a complaint was filed in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, alleging that&nbsp; the defendant and appellee,&nbsp; Sia Lam Han, is&nbsp; a&nbsp; Chinese laborer within&nbsp; the Philippine&nbsp; Islands, without the certificate of residence required by Act No. 702 of the United States Philippine Commission,&nbsp; and asked for his arrest, in order that the court might determine whether&nbsp; he had a right to remain in&nbsp; the Islands,&nbsp; and that he be deported if he be&nbsp; found&nbsp; without legal right to remain.<br><br>The order of arrest was issued, the&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; was arrested, brought before the court and tried.&nbsp; At the close of the trial the&nbsp; Honorable A. S. Cross field, judge, found from the evidence that the defendant is the son of a merchant ; that he came to the Philippine Islands when he was 14 years&nbsp; of age; that he was still a minor by several years when certificates of&nbsp; registration were issued; that he is now a merchant and has been a merchant for the five years last past, being a partner in a business with a capital stock of from four to five thousand pesos, and entered a judgment dismissing&nbsp; the complaint and discharging the respondent from custody, with costs <i>de officio.</i><br><br>From&nbsp; that judgment the Solicitor-General appealed&nbsp; to this&nbsp; court and alleged (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>)&nbsp; that the lower court erred in its finding of facts; and (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) that the lower court erred in dismissing the complaint and&nbsp; discharging the respondent. <br><br>An examination&nbsp; of the facts shows that the appellee was taken before the customs&nbsp; officials and examined.&nbsp; During that examination he testified that he was 27 years of age; that he was a merchant in the dry goods business; that he had about P2,000 invested in said business; that he was a Chinaman;&nbsp; that he came to the Philippine Islands about four years before the date of the examination&nbsp; (the examination was had on the 24th day of July, 1913) ; that he landed at Zamboanga; that he&nbsp; came to Zamboanga from Sandakan.<br><br>During the&nbsp; examination in the Court of First Instance, the appellee declared&nbsp; again in his own behalf and stated that he was a merchant doing business in the city of Manila; that he came to the Philippine Islands about thirteen years before; that he landed at Zamboanga; that he was 14 years old when he came; that he was 27 years old at the time of the examination; that&nbsp; his father was a merchant in China; that when he landed in the Philippine Islands he did not&nbsp; present himself to the immigration&nbsp; authorities; that he did not have the regular Chinese certificate&nbsp; permitting him to land in the Philippine Islands.&nbsp;&nbsp; He further stated that when he arrived in the Philippine Islands, the Spaniards were still governing the Islands.<br><br>Accepting the declaration of the appellee made before the Court of First Instance,&nbsp; it clearly appears that he was in the&nbsp; Philippine Islands during&nbsp; the&nbsp; years&nbsp; within which Chinese laborers were&nbsp; required to register under Act&nbsp; No. 702.&nbsp; There is no attempt on his part to show that he was a merchant&nbsp; during that period.&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the reasons why he was permitted to remain in&nbsp; the Philippine&nbsp; Islands by the lower court&nbsp; was the&nbsp; fact that he was&nbsp; the son&nbsp; of a merchant.&nbsp; That fact may or may not be true, but inasmuch as his father was not a merchant in the Philippine&nbsp; Islands, the fact&nbsp; cannot avail the&nbsp; appellee or give him a right to remain&nbsp; here.&nbsp; Inasmuch&nbsp; as the&nbsp; record&nbsp; shows that&nbsp; the appellee&nbsp; was in&nbsp; the Philippine Islands during&nbsp; the period within which he was required by law to register under Act No. 702,&nbsp; and in view of the fact&nbsp; that&nbsp; he has failed to show that he was a merchant during&nbsp; that period, he has failed to show&nbsp; any&nbsp; right to remain&nbsp; in the Philippine&nbsp; Islands. (U. S. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Yu&nbsp; Wa, 28 Phil. Rep., 1.)&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not incumbent upon&nbsp; the Government to prove&nbsp; affirmatively that&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellee in the present case was&nbsp; a laborer&nbsp; and&nbsp; should have registered under the Act.&nbsp; The burden is&nbsp; by law expressly placed upon&nbsp; the&nbsp; alien&nbsp; to&nbsp; demonstrate that&nbsp; he&nbsp; was&nbsp; not within the class which was required by the Act to register. The law provides&nbsp; that every Chinese person found without the required certificate in&nbsp; the Philippine Islands, after the expiration of&nbsp; the time limited by law for&nbsp; registration, shall be&nbsp; presumed, in the absence&nbsp; of&nbsp; satisfactory proof to the contrary, to be a Chinese&nbsp; laborer and shall be subject to deportation as&nbsp; provided for by Act No. 702.&nbsp; The mere fact that he&nbsp; becomes a merchant after the expiration of the period within which the law required him to register, is not sufficient.&nbsp; The&nbsp; fact which determines whether or not he shall be deported is whether or not he obtained a certificate during&nbsp; the period required by&nbsp; law.&nbsp; (U. S. <i>vs.</i> Lim Co, 12&nbsp; Phil. Rep., 703.)&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the status which he enjoyed during the period for&nbsp; registration which determines his right to remain.&nbsp; If he was a laborer during that period, and failed to register, the fact&nbsp; that he is&nbsp; a merchant now will not&nbsp; defeat his deportation.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Juan Co <i>vs.</i> Rafferty, 14 Phil. Rep., 235.)&nbsp; The appellee made&nbsp; no effort, in&nbsp; the present case, to show that he was a merchant during the period required for registration.&nbsp; He clearly&nbsp; admits that he was not.&nbsp; He&nbsp; claimed that&nbsp; he came to the Philippine Islands during the Spanish regime and that&nbsp; he had been a merchant only during the past three or&nbsp; four years.<br><br>In our opinion the judgment of the lower court should be and is&nbsp; hereby reversed, and it is hereby ordered&nbsp; that&nbsp; a judgment be entered directing that the cause be remanded to the court below, with direction that a judgment be entered ordering the appellee deported from the Philippine Islands. And without any finding as to costs, it is so ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano,&nbsp; C. J.,&nbsp; Torres, Carson,</i> and <i>Araulo, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br>MORELAND, J., <i>concurring</i>:<br><br>I agree with this decision except that if the question were an open one I would doubt the right of the Government to appeal in cases of&nbsp; this character. </div>
