				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. DAMIAN SANTA ANA AND DOROTEA RAMOS, DEFENDANTS.  DOROTEA RAMOS, APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>TRENT, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Damian  Santa Ana and Dorotea Ramos,  husband and wife,  were charged in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Rizal with the crime of <em>lesiones menos graves.</em> Damian was acquitted and his wife found guilty as charged and sentenced to one month and one day of <em>arresto mayor</em>, to indemnify  the offended party in the sum of P42,  to the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment  in the case of insolvency,  and to the payment of one-half the costs of the cause.  She appealed.</p>
<p>The appellant  admits having  inflicted upon  the complaining party,  Antonio Santos, certain wounds with  a <i>bolo</i>.  As a result of these wounds, Santos was incapacitated for the performance of his ordinary  duties as  a laborer  for the period of twelve days.  The witnesses for the prosecution, including the complaining party, testified to the effect that on the night in question Antonio Santos was seated near a <i>tienda </i>when Dorotea Ramos came near and stated to him that she desired to talk with him about certain matters.  Santos declined to accede to this request on the ground, as he stated, that Dorotea's husband might be jealous of him and he did not want to be  caught talking with her in the streets at  night;  that on his refusal to comply with her request, Dorotea approached him and suddenly drew a <i>bolo</i> from under her apparel where it was concealed and inflicted the wounds.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the appellant and her witnesses testify that as the appellant was going from her house to a certain <i>tienda</i> for the purpose of  making  a  small  purchase, she was met by Antonio Santos in a  dark place, somewhat isolated  from any buildings, and that Santos  immediately caught her by the arm and began to drag her off the street into an uninhabited place for the purpose of forcibly having illicit relations with her.  The result was that the testimony given by the prosecution was irreconcilable with that given on behalf of the appellant.  The trial court, after a careful examination of the testimony,ade the following finding of facts:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The testimony of the woman  herself is  the  more acceptable, which is to the effect that the accused  Antonio Santos, upon  seeing her near an isolated place,  caught her  by the arm, tried to drag her to an obscure spot there to take advantage of her,  and that, in  order to  defend herself, it was necessary to wound  the said Santos  with the bolo that she carried." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>We think the trial court reached a proper conclusion  as to how the trouble occurred; but we  cannot agree with his application of the law to these facts.</p>
<p>Article 8 of the Penal Code reads:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The following are exempt from criminal liability:</p>
  <p align="center">*       *      *       *       **      *</p>
  <p>"4.  Anyone who acts in defense of his person or rights, provided that the following circumstances concur:</p>
  <p>"(1)  Unlawful aggression;</p>
  <p>"(2)  Reasonable necessity for the means employed  to prevent or repel it;</p>
  <p>"(3)  Lack of sufficient provocation  on the part of the person defending himself."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the judgment appealed from,  the first and third  of these  circumstances were found in favor of the appellant, but the court said that  under the  testimony, and taking into consideration the  fact that the appellant, who is one of the most vigorous Filipinas, and Santos not being physically one of  the  strongest of  men,  it was  not reasonably necessary for the appellant to have used her <i>bolo</i> to repel the attack which was made upon her by Santos; that she could have escaped the consequences of this act by calling for help.</p>
<p>Both the appellant and the offended party were married. The appellant was going along the street attending  to her own business, when  she was attacked by Santos.  He caught her by the arm and was forcibly taking her to a dark  place, off  the street, for the purpose, as we have said, of having illicit relations with her.   She most seriously objected and  sought, by means of her own physical strength, to release herself, but  Santos persisted in his attempt.  It was then  that the appellant used her <i>bolo</i>.  She used it for the protection of her honor, and to repel this brutal attack which was made  upon  her.  Santos knew that the appellant  was a  married woman and living happily  with her husband. He also knew  that  if he ever could have carnal relations  with  her,  it  must be  by  force.  So  he deliberately planned to  commit one of the most heinous crimes known to our criminal law; and when he received the blows inflicted by the appellant with  her <i> bolo</i>  which she carried, he was  then  carrying out his fiendish design  or plan.   Such injuries are  not by any means greater than  he deserved, and  the appellant was perfectly  justified, under the facts and circumstances, in using any kind of a weapon at  her command which was necessary to repel this attack, and to continue using it until she was able to free herself from Santos' clutches.   When a man becomes so debased as to  lose every instinct of manhood and  engages himself in the commission of so serious a crime, he  certainly stakes his life and liberty in his own hands, and  if he loses the latter or receives serious personal injuries, his loss is no greater than he deserves.   The  appellant is  therefore entitled to an  absolute acquittal upon  the ground  of  self-defense.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from  is therefore  reversed and the appellant  ordered  released  from custody forthwith, with costs <em>de oficio.</em></p>
<p><em> Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson, </em>and <em>Moreland, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
