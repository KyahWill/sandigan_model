				<h4>
				G.R. No. 12693, August 11, 1917</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. CAMILOY (NON-CHRISTIAN), LOPE GUITAGULAN, GAUDENCIO BEQUILLA, AND EPIPANIO CAINILLA, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The four accused by force and intimidation took a young mountain woman named 
Aquilina (or Tranquilina) to an isolated house, and there, again with force and 
intimidation, successively throughout the night had carnal intercourse with her. 
Discrepancies in the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution are noticed, 
but these in the main are to be expected because of the lack of intelligence of 
the witnesses. On the whole, we find no reason to interfere with the findings of 
the trial court.
<p>The Attorney-General recommends that in view of the fact that there are 
present three aggravating circumstances, namely, those of taking advantage of 
superior strength, of employing means which brought about ignominy, and of 
commission in the nighttime, that the minimum of the maximum penalty provided by 
law should be imposed. The Attorney-General also recommends that the accused 
jointly and severally endow the offended party in the sum of P500, and support 
the offspring, should there be any, until its majority.</p>
<p>We not only agree with the Attorney-General but, considering the beastly 
character of the crime and the concurrence of three aggravating circumstances 
offset by no mitigating circumstance, would go further and impose the most 
severe penalty permitted by law. We accordingly sentence each of the accused to 
twenty years of <em>reclusion temporal</em>, with the accessory penalties of 
article 59 of the Penal Code, and to pay one-fourth of the costs in both 
instances. The accused are also jointly and severally condemned by way of 
indemnification to endow the offended woman in the sum of P500, and to support 
the offspring if there be any. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Johnson, Carson, Araullo</em>, and <em>Street JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p></div>
