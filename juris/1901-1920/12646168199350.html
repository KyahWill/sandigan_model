				G.R. No. 1259, July 24, 1903</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE,  VS.  DOMINGO BERRY, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The Solicitor-General and the attorney for the defendant have joined in a petition that the defendant be included in the amnesty of July 4,1902.</p>
<p>There  is evidence in the case that the defendant was participating against the United States in the insurrection in December,  1900, when the crime  was committed; that he had been  ordered by his chief to kill all  spies of the Americans; that he believed  that the deceased was such a spy and that the defendant killed him for that reason.  If this evidence can be believed the petition should be granted. Although the evidence is conflicting and  is  not entirely satisfactory, we have decided that it is more probable than otherwise that the story of  the defendant is substantially true.   The  petition is  accordingly granted and, on filing in this  court the oath required  by the proclamation, an order will be entered dismissing the case.   It is so ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Cooper, Mapa,</em> and <em>McDonough, JJ.,</em>  concur.</p>
