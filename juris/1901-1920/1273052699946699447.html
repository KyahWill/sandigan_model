				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Appellant in this case was convicted of the crime of "faithlessness in the custody of documents,"&nbsp; as defined and penalized in subsection 1 of article 360 of the Penal Code.<br><br>The evidence discloses that while&nbsp; acting as assistant postmaster of&nbsp; the&nbsp; municipality&nbsp; of Mabalacat,&nbsp; Pampanga,&nbsp; the defendant extracted P24 from a registered letter&nbsp; which had been handed him for registry; that he entered the letter in the registry&nbsp; receipt book of the post-office, but failed and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; neglected to forward it&nbsp; to its destination; that some days after the letter had been received for registry he took it to the&nbsp; sender, confessed that he&nbsp; had extracted the money, returned a part thereof,&nbsp; and&nbsp; promised payment&nbsp; of the remainder, and begged the sender of the letter to forgive the wrong he had done him and to conceal his misconduct.<br><br>Counsel&nbsp; for appellant contends that these facts&nbsp; do not justify the conviction of the defendant under the provisions of subsection&nbsp; 1 of&nbsp; article&nbsp; 860,&nbsp; because as counsel alleges, the record fails to disclose affirmatively that the defendant was a "public official" at&nbsp; the time&nbsp; the alleged crime was committed; and because further, as he insists,&nbsp; even if it be admitted that he was a public official and that&nbsp; he did unlawfully appropriate the money contents of the letter, "grave injury to a third person or&nbsp; to the public interests did not result from the act," so&nbsp; that the less harsh penalty prescribed in&nbsp; subsection 2&nbsp; of&nbsp; article 360 should have been imposed.<br><br>Article 360&nbsp; is as&nbsp; follows:<br><blockquote>"The public official who&nbsp; shall steal,&nbsp; destroy, or hide any documents or&nbsp; papers intrusted to him by virtue of his office shall be punished &nbsp;<br><br>"1. With the penalties of provision mayor and a fine of from 625 to 6,250 pesetas, provided that a&nbsp; grave injury to a third person or the public interests has resulted from his action.<br><br>"2. With those of <i>prision correccional</i> in its minimum and medium&nbsp; degrees and a fine of from 325 to 3,250 pesetas if the injury to&nbsp; the third&nbsp; person&nbsp; or to the&nbsp; public&nbsp; interests were not grave.<br><br>"In either case there shall, furthermore, be imposed the penalty of temporary&nbsp; special&nbsp; disqualification in its&nbsp; maximum degree to perpetual special disqualification."</blockquote>Notwithstanding the denial of the defendant that he had ever been&nbsp; appointed assistant&nbsp; postmaster,&nbsp; we think&nbsp; the evidence&nbsp; strongly tends to establish that fact; but however this may be, the defendant's own admissions&nbsp; leave no room for doubt that at the&nbsp; time when he received the letter in question&nbsp; for&nbsp; registry, he was acting for,&nbsp; and instead of, the postmaster, by&nbsp; commission&nbsp; of and direction of the postmaster, and the postmaster being undoubtedly a "public official,"&nbsp; defendant was criminally liable for any infidelity in&nbsp; the custody of the documents and papers thus intrusted to him, as though he himself were a public official, by virtue of the general provisions of the second paragraph of article 362 of the code, which are as follows:<br><blockquote>"The penalties prescribed in the three preceding articles are also&nbsp; applicable to&nbsp; ecclesiastics and to individuals intrusted temporarily&nbsp; with the transmission or custody of documents or&nbsp; papers,&nbsp; by commission of the Government or of officials to whom&nbsp; they may&nbsp; have been intrusted by virtue of their office."</blockquote>The question whether&nbsp; or not the acts complained of resulted in a "grave injury"&nbsp; to the public interests presents more difficulty.<br><br>Viada suggests&nbsp; that for the purpose of determining the character of damages referred to&nbsp; in these articles we should look to the eighth chapter of Title XII of the code, which, treating of damages to property&nbsp; of another unlawfully and criminally caused (in cases wherein the code imposes no specific penalty&nbsp; in other provisions thereof),&nbsp; prescribes a greater or lesser penalty as&nbsp; the&nbsp; amount is&nbsp; greater&nbsp; or&nbsp; less than 6,250 pesetas. But, while this chapter might, perhaps, be&nbsp; safely&nbsp; followed in cases&nbsp; where the amount of damage is capable of monetary valuation, it furnishes no satisfactory guide in cases of damages where&nbsp; the injury is not subject of monetary valuation, since it expressly provides a single penalty, with&nbsp; wide discretionary&nbsp; limits,&nbsp; in all cases of the destruction of documents&nbsp; and papers whose&nbsp; value is&nbsp; not subject of monetary valuation.<br><br>It would be impossible to give a precise monetary value to the injury done to&nbsp; the public service by the theft of the contents of registered mail by an employee charged with its transmission.&nbsp;&nbsp; Certain it is that in addition to the actual injury done to the owner of&nbsp; the contents of such mail, the doubt and uncertainty as to the safety of registered packages resulting from thefts of their contents,&nbsp; does&nbsp; amount to a very real and positive injury to the postal service and hence to the "public interests."&nbsp; In the case of&nbsp; The United States <i> vs.</i> Marino&nbsp; (10 Phil. Rep., 652) wherein&nbsp; the defendant was charged with a&nbsp; crime similar&nbsp; to that committed by the defendant in this case,&nbsp; and it was shown that defendant had been guilty of several separate thefts from registered mail intrusted to him, we held as follows, stating&nbsp; the doctrine as laid down in the syllabus of that case:<br><blockquote>"For the&nbsp; proper qualification of the gravity of the injury caused&nbsp; to third parties&nbsp; or to the&nbsp; public interests&nbsp; in consequence&nbsp; of the above-mentioned crime of infidelity in the custody and dispatch of mails intrusted to the administration of posts, it does not suffice to take into account the extent of the injury or damage inflicted respectively on each of the parties interested in the ordinary or registered letters stolen, hidden, or destroyed by the unfaithful functionary, but&nbsp; it must be further considered that the unlawful conduct of the officer affects the public interests, inasmuch as the loss of packages, and the disappearance of letters, generally cause uneasiness and a certain alarm among the interested parties, some of whom, in the case at bar, filed their complaints with the Director of Posts.&nbsp; Such deeds committed in a post-office tend to alienate the confidence of the public in a Government service&nbsp; of the greatest necessity in social life, thus causing a grave injury of far-reaching effects to the public interests. Therefore, the penalty that should be&nbsp; applied is the more severe one prescribed in&nbsp; No. 1 of article 360 of the Penal Code, according to&nbsp; the&nbsp; jurisprudence established&nbsp; by&nbsp; the supreme court of&nbsp; Spain in its decisions&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; 2d of December, 1895, and the 7th of January, 1904,&nbsp; rendered on appeals in cassation,&nbsp; when applying&nbsp; the&nbsp; provisions of the corresponding article of&nbsp; the Spanish&nbsp; Code, analogous&nbsp; to that in force in these Islands."</blockquote>After a full consideration and review of the reasons upon which&nbsp; our decision in that case was based we&nbsp; adhere to the conclusions announced&nbsp; therein,&nbsp; and we are further of opinion,&nbsp; and so&nbsp; hold, that&nbsp; the injury done to the "public interests" by each and every separate theft of the contents of registered mail by post-office&nbsp; officials into whose&nbsp; hands it is intrusted for delivery is a "grave"&nbsp; injury thereto, and subjects&nbsp; the offender to the penalties prescribed in subsection&nbsp; 1 of article 360 of the Penal&nbsp; Code.<br><br>The&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; of conviction and the sentence imposed by the&nbsp; trial court should be&nbsp; affirmed, with the costs of this instance&nbsp; against the appellant.&nbsp; So&nbsp; ordered.<br><br><i> Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Moreland</i>,&nbsp; and <i>Trent,&nbsp; JJ.,</i>&nbsp; concur.<br></div>
