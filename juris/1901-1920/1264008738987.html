				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The  appellants were convicted of the crime  of homicide by the Court of First Instance of the Province of Cebu.</p>
<p>The information  upon which this prosecution is based charges  Cosme  Juares, Fernando Juares, Crispin  Juares, Mariano Empalmado, Juan Caramugan, Pedro Juares, and Valentin Juares with having inflicted serious wounds upon the person  of one  Saturnino  Lapas,  from  the effects  of which  he died.   One of the  defendants, Mariano  Empalmado, was not before the court, and another, Cosme Juares, was acquitted.  This appeal  is now presented by the other five defendants, who were convicted in the court below.</p>
<p>It appears that on the 28th day of  September,  1909, a fiesta was celebrated in the barrio of Calignan, in the municipality of Carcar, Province of Cebu.  In the late afternoon of the day of the fiesta, Lapas, a man of rather violent character, was in a  state of intoxication, going about the village in a  boisterous and unruly manner,  disturbing and abusing the people who  were in attendance on the fiesta. He was especially troublesome to the tenderas, interfering with them in the conduct of their business.  Crisanto Tangaro, <em>teniente</em> of the barrio of Calignan, took him  to task and reprimanded him for his bad  conduct.  Hardly had Tangaro gone away  before Lapas engaged in a fresh altercation with  Cosme Juares, who was endeavoring to take from him a  rather dangerous club which he was carrying. Cosme  Juares, who was a <em>teniente</em> of an adjoining barrio,       called upon the other defendants herein, his relatives and subordinates, to come to his aid and not to leave him  alone in his efforts to get possession of the club.  They responded, and a general disturbance followed, in which quite a number of persons took part.  Lapas received several slight wounds and registered  a complaint with the <em>teniente </em>of the barrio of Calignan, Crisanto Tangaro, against one Francisco Gellido, alias Butong.  The <em>teniente</em> determined to take both Lapas and  Butong before  the  proper authorities  of the village in order that an investigation might be made of the charges.  At this point the defendant Juan Caramugan, who had gone away at the beginning of the altercation between Cosme Juares  and Lapas,  returned armed with a <em>pinuti</em> (a bolo or long knife), and  upon seeing Lapas  approached him in a threatening attitude.  Lapas apparently became frightened and attempted to make his escape.   Juan Caramugan was disarmed, and about the same time Lapas broke away and was  followed by Mariano  Empalmado,  armed with a pinuti, Fernando Juares, also armed with the <em>pinuti</em> which had been  taken away from  Juan Caramugan, and by  Crispin Juares, who, though unarmed, was throwing stones and taking an  active part in the pursuit.  These three defendants were presently joined  by Pedro Juares and Valentin Juares, who likewise threw stones at the fleeing Lapas.  The deceased was  last seen alive  endeavoring to make his escape from thes.e five defendants in the growing darkness of the night  The dead body of Lapas was found on the following day in a near-by field, covered with cuts, wounds, and bruises of various kinds.</p>
<p>Juan Caramugan took no  part in the pursuit, and  does not appear to have been present when the death of Saturnino Lapas took place.   It is true that while  the deceased was being held in custody he approached him in  a threatening attitude and apparently was the first to make the movement against the deceased which doubtless resulted  in the deceased's breaking arrest and  taking to flight.  The court below was of opinion that  Caramugan was the leader in the disturbance which resulted in the death of the deceased, and was of opinion that the fact that he did not join the pursuit did not relieve him of criminal responsibility.   The record however does not disclose any evidence of conspiracy to take the life  of the deceased prior to the time  when the party pursued him into the  fields after he had broken his arrest.   There is nothing whatever in the record to show that Caramugan had any reason to believe or to anticipate that the defendants, who actually pursued Lapas, would do him to death when they caught up  with him.   We are of opinion, therefore, that  the judgment of conviction should not be sustained as to him.</p>
<p>There were no witnesses present when the deceased  was actually done to death,  but there can be  no reasonable doubt that he came to his death at the hands of the party which pursued him after he broke his arrest.  There may have been  others who also took a part in this tragic affair, and who may even have been more active participants than these defendants and appellants, but this in no wise relieves the appellants of their responsibility.   We hold that there is no reasonable doubt as to their  guilt.</p>
<p>We agree with the trial judge, however, that the evidence discloses no aggravating circumstances, and that the provisions  of  article 11  [Penal Code] should  be taken into consideration  under all  the  circumstances of this case in extenuation of the guilt of  the accused, and further that the conduct of the deceased, which provoked and brought on the quarrel or disturbance  which  resulted in his  death should also be taken  into consideration as  an  additional extenuating circumstance.</p>
<p>With reference to Valentin Juares, a further mitigating circumstance was taken into  consideration  by  the  court below, in that he was  under 18 years of age, and appears to have been acting under the belief that he was obeying the orders  of a superior officer.  The trial judge sentenced this defendant to two years four months and one day of <em>prision  correccional.</em>  The other appellants were each sentenced to twelve years and one day of <em>reclusion temporal</em>, and to the payment of one seventh of the costs of the action, and to indemnify jointly  and severally the heirs  of  the deceased in the sum of one thousand pesos.</p>
<p>It appears that Valentin Juares was  under 18 years of age and over 15.  Section 2 of article 85 of the Penal Code provides that "the penalty next lower than that prescribed by law" is to be applied in its proper degree in such cases. This penalty in the  present case is  <em>prision mayor</em> in its minimum degree.</p>
<p>There is evidence in the record  which tends to disclose that in intervening  in the disturbance  which resulted  in the arrest of the deceased  and in the attempt to  recapture him when he broke from  arrest, all  of the convicts were acting  under the orders of the  <em>teniente</em> of  their barrio, and believed that it was their duty to obey those orders; but  it is very  clear that no such orders could justify or excuse their conduct  in  doing the unarmed man  to  death, while he was attempting to escape from the scene  of the disturbance.</p>
<p>The judgment of conviction and the sentence of the trial court in so far as Juan Caramugan is affected thereby should be and  is hereby reversed,  and he  is acquitted of the crime with which he is charged, with his share  of the costs in both instances <em>de oficio.</em>  He will therefore  be  set at liberty forthwith. <br></p><p>So much of the sentence as imposes upon the defendant Valentin Juares the penalty of two years four months and one  day of  <em>prision correccional</em>  should  be  and is hereby modified by substituting in  lieu thereof the penalty  of six years and one day of  <em>prision mayor,</em> and thus modified the judgment  of conviction and the sentence imposed upon  all the appellants  except  Juan Caramugan is  affirmed, with their respective  shares of the costs of this instance against them.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres,  Mapa, Johnson,  Moreland,</em> and <em>Trent,  JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
