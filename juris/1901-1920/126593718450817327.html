				<BR><STRONG>MORELAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>At the time the accident occurred, 
which is the basis of this action, there was a single-track street-car line 
running along Calle Herran, with occasional switches to allow cars to meet and 
pass each other. One of these switches was located at the scene of the 
accident.</p>
<p>The plaintiff had been visiting his friend, a man by the name of Creveling, 
in front of whose house the accident happened. He desired to board a certain 
"San Marcelino" car coming from Santa Ana and bound for Manila. Being told by 
Creveling that the car was approaching, he immediately, and somewhat hurriedly, 
passed from the gate into the street for the purpose of signaling and boarding 
the car. The car was a closed one, the entrance being from the front or the rear 
platform. Plaintiff attempted to board the front platform but, seeing that he 
could not reach it without extra exertion, stopped beside the car, facing toward 
the rear platform, and waited for it to come abreast of him in order to board. 
While in this position he was struck from behind and run over by the defendant's 
automobile.</p>
<p>The defendant entered Calle Herran at Calle Penafrancia in his automobile 
driven by his chauffeur, a competent driver. A street car bound from Manila to 
Santa Ana being immediately in front of him, he followed along behind it. Just 
before reaching the scene of the accident the street car which he was following 
took the switchâ€”that is, went off the main line to the left upon the switch 
lying alongside of the main track. Thereupon the defendant no longer followed 
that street car nor went to the left, but either kept straight ahead on the main 
street-car track or a bit to the right. The car which the plaintiff intended to 
board was on the main line and bound in an opposite direction to that in which 
defendant was going. When the front of the "San Marcelino" car, the one the 
plaintiff attempted to board, was almost in front of defendant's automobile, 
defendant's driver suddenly went to the right and struck and ran over the 
plaintiff, as above described.</p>
<p>The judgment of the trial court was for defendant. A careful examination of 
the record leads us to the conclusion that defendant's driver was guilty of 
negligence in running upon and over the plaintiff. He was passing an oncoming 
car upon the wrong side. The plaintiff, in coming out to board the car, was not 
obliged, for his own protection, to observe whether a car was coming upon him 
from his left hand. He had only to guard against those coming from the right. He 
knew that, according to the law of the road, no automobile or other vehicle 
coming from his left should pass upon his side of the car. He needed only to 
watch for cars coming from his right, as they were the only ones under the law 
permitted to pass upon that side of the street car.</p>
<p>The defendant, however, is not responsible for the negligence of his driver, 
under the facts and circumstances of this case. As we have said in the case of 
Johnson <em>vs.</em> David (5 Phil. Rep., 663), the driver does not fall within 
the list of persons in article 1903 of the Civil Code for whose acts the 
defendant would be responsible.</p>
<p>Although in the David case the owner of the vehicle was not present at the 
time the alleged negligent acts were committed by the driver, the same rule 
applies where the owner is present, unless the negligent acts of the driver are 
continued for such a length of time as to give the owner a reasonable 
opportunity to observe them and to direct his driver to desist therefrom. An 
owner who sits in his automobile, or other vehicle, and permits his driver to 
continue in a violation of the law by the performance of negligent acts, after 
he has had a reasonable opportunity to observe them and to direct that the 
driver cease therefrom, becomes himself responsible for such acts. The owner of 
an automobile who permits his chauffeur to drive up the Escolta, for example, at 
a speed of 60 miles an hour, without any effort to stop him, although he has had 
a reasonable opportunity to do so, becomes himself responsible, both criminally 
and civilly, for the' results produced by the acts of his chauffeur. On the 
other hand, if the driver, by a sudden act of negligence, and without the owner 
having a reasonable opportunity to prevent the act or its continuance, injures a 
person or violates the criminal law, the owner of the automobile, although 
present therein at the time the act was committed, is not responsible, either 
civilly or criminally, therefor. The act complained of must be continued in the 
presence of the owner for such a length of time that the owner, by his 
acquiescence, makes his driver's act his own.</p>
<p>In the case before us it does not appear from the record that, from the time 
the automobile took the wrong side of the road to the commission of the injury, 
sufficient time intervened to give the defendant an opportunity to correct the 
act of his driver. Instead, it appears with fair clearness that the interval 
between the turning out to meet and pass the street car and the happening of the 
accident was so small as not to be sufficient to charge defendant with the 
negligence of the driver.</p>
<p>Whether or not the owner of an automobile driven by a competent driver, would 
be responsible, whether present or not, for the negligent acts of his driver 
when the automobile was a part of a business enterprise, and was being driven at 
the time of the accident in furtherance of the owner's business, we do not now 
decide.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed, from is affirmed, with costs against the 
appellant.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Carson,</em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em>Trent, J.,</em> concurs in the result.<br></p></div>
