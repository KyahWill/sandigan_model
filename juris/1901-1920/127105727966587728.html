				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal from&nbsp; a judgment of the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; the city of&nbsp; Manila,&nbsp; Hon.&nbsp; James&nbsp; C. Jenkins presiding, convicting the defendants of the crime of arson and sentencing each one of them to ten years and one day of <i>presidio mayor,</i> with the accessory&nbsp; penalties prescribed in article&nbsp; 57 of the&nbsp; Penal Code,&nbsp; to pay one-half the costs and to indemnify, jointly and severally, the Manila Cockpit Company&nbsp; in the sum of P80.<br><br>On the 6th day of August, 1909, there were two cockpits, one old and the other newly erected,&nbsp; situated in the municipality of&nbsp; Caloocan, Province of Rizal, but within the police limits of the city of Manila.&nbsp;&nbsp; Between 9.30 and&nbsp; 10 o'clock of the night of that day the&nbsp; new cockpit&nbsp; was feloniously set on fire.<br><br>The witness Bartolome Buenaventura testified that he knew both of the accused, Juan&nbsp; Lipia being his uncle, and that he had known them since he was a boy; that he knew the cockpits in question and their location; that on&nbsp; the 4th of August he&nbsp; was&nbsp; planting rice when Ceferino Benitez came and called him;&nbsp; that Ceferino Benitez asked him to go along with him to burn the new cockpit; that the witness replied that he was&nbsp; not disposed to go because he had his own business to attend to; that the&nbsp; next day, the 5th, the witness went over to&nbsp; Ceferino's house to get&nbsp; a bolo that he had bought from him, when Ceferino again spoke to him&nbsp; about burning the new cockpit; that the witness still objected and told him that he did not want to go with him; that on the 6th Ceferino waited for the witness on a certain road and&nbsp; spoke to him again, saying that he wanted him to go with him to&nbsp; burn the&nbsp; new cockpit that night; that the witness still refused to go because,&nbsp; as he alleged, it was not right, in the first place, and,&nbsp; in the&nbsp; second place, he was afraid of&nbsp; the owners of the new cockpit; that after being threatened by Ceferino he finally consented to go&nbsp; with him; that Ceferino also told him that he would be well paid for it; that on asking him how much they were to receive, he replied P500; that the witness asked, who is going to pay that sum,&nbsp; and&nbsp; he replied,&nbsp; Pedro&nbsp; Casimiro;&nbsp; that he went with them on the evening of the 6th; that prior to their going they agreed how the cockpit was to be burned; that they arrived at the cockpit between 9.30 and 10.30 o'clock; that the witness told the accused that it would be better to wait until they had the money before they burned the cockpit; that they replied that as soon as the cockpit started to burn there would be some one who would get the money from Juana, a widow, who was a shareholder in the cockpit; that the arrangement was to pour petroleum on the cockpit; that the two accused were to&nbsp; go on one side of the cockpit and the witness&nbsp; on the other;&nbsp; that the two accused carried a bottle of petroleum with them as, according to the plan, these two were to set fire to the same side of the cockpit; that they both carried&nbsp; matches;&nbsp; that&nbsp; they&nbsp; arrived at the outside of the fence of the cockpit and the witness told them that they should take one side and he would take the other,&nbsp; so&nbsp; that the fire&nbsp; could&nbsp; be started in two different places&nbsp; at&nbsp; once;&nbsp; that the two accused broke through the fence and threw the petroleum on the cockpit and touched a match to the oil that&nbsp; was running down; that&nbsp; when the fire was started by&nbsp; the accused&nbsp; the&nbsp; witness&nbsp; had not yet broken through&nbsp; the fence on&nbsp; his side; that, seeing the fire burning brightly, he took&nbsp; fear and ran away;&nbsp; that&nbsp; their agreement was to meet at the house&nbsp; of Ceferino the next morning; that the cockpit was only partly destroyed; that he met the accused the next morning and asked them about the money they&nbsp; were to get for burning the cockpit; that the accused told&nbsp; him&nbsp; that they received only P20; that they showed him the money; that they gave him P10; that the witness later tried to get more money from the accused but did not succeed.<br><br>The&nbsp; witness Alejandro Nagua testified that he was acquainted with Ceferino&nbsp; Benitez and Juan&nbsp; Lipia, and had known them for some years prior to the 6th&nbsp; day of August, the date on which the cockpit in question was set on fire; that on the night of the said 6th of August he was out in the fields catching snipe; that&nbsp; he had as&nbsp; his companion Ambrosio Alipio; that he was&nbsp; hunting&nbsp; near where the cockpit was located; that the witness suddenly saw a light at&nbsp; the cockpit and after observing a&nbsp; moment and noting that it was on fire, he&nbsp; and his companion hurried toward the place; that when they arrived&nbsp; near the&nbsp; building they saw Ceferino Benitez and Juan Lipia going in the direction of Masambong, running.<br><br>The testimony of the last&nbsp; witness&nbsp; was corroborated&nbsp; by Ambrosio Alipio, his companion.<br><br>Juan&nbsp; Alipio testified&nbsp; that&nbsp; he was the caretaker of the cockpit on the night it&nbsp; was burnt and&nbsp; had been such for some time&nbsp; prior thereto; that he&nbsp; was&nbsp; awakened&nbsp; in the nighttime by the fire; that there was&nbsp; no lamp or other fire in or around the cockpit&nbsp; during&nbsp; that&nbsp; night; that the following morning they found the fence broken through and a petroleum bottle with shoestrings&nbsp; tied about it; that six stakes were pulled off the fence near the place where the fire was&nbsp; ignited and two near the&nbsp; water-closet.<br><br>Anastasia&nbsp;&nbsp; Martin,&nbsp; wife&nbsp; of Bartolome Buenaventura, testified that the accused Ceferino&nbsp; Benitez had told her that if&nbsp; her husband Bartolome would turn&nbsp; his back on&nbsp; that matter&nbsp; of the fire,&nbsp; Pedro&nbsp; Casimiro would pay him any amount he wanted;&nbsp; that she told her husband what Ceferino had said.<br><br>Lucio de Guzman, a witness for the&nbsp; prosecution, testified that he was a resident of the&nbsp; barrio of Balintawak, municipality of Caloocan,&nbsp; and by occupation a farmer; that he had known&nbsp; Juan&nbsp; Lipia and&nbsp; Ceferino&nbsp; Benitez&nbsp; since&nbsp; his boyhood;&nbsp; that before the fire&nbsp; he&nbsp; had&nbsp; a&nbsp; conversation with Ceferino Benitez&nbsp; in the presence of Jua.n Lipia; that&nbsp; they asked him to go with&nbsp; them to assist them&nbsp; in burning the cockpit and stated to him that they would&nbsp; get P500;&nbsp; that later they again invited him to assist them; that the witness declined to implicate himself in the crime.<br><br>On cross-examination&nbsp; this witness testified that he had been arrested for taking part in what he called the revolt of 1903 and sentenced to five years in Bilibid;&nbsp; and that the charge against him was&nbsp; <i>bandolerismo.</i><br><br>In his opinion, forming the basis of his judgment of&nbsp; conviction, the learned trial court says:<br><blockquote>"Eight or nine apparently credible witnesses testified for the prosecution.&nbsp;&nbsp; Their evidence fully&nbsp; and&nbsp; indubitably establishes the guilt of the two accused substantially as alleged.&nbsp; The court is&nbsp; satisfied&nbsp; to&nbsp; a reasonable&nbsp; certainty and&nbsp; beyond a reasonable doubt&nbsp; that the two accused are guilty substantially as&nbsp; alleged in the information and the court so finds.<br><br>"If the two witnesses who swore positively that on the night of the 6th of August, 1909, they were out snipe hunting,&nbsp; and saw the&nbsp; two accused coming from the direction of the cockpit alleged to have been fired by the accused, stated the&nbsp; truth,&nbsp; then the alleged&nbsp; defense falls to&nbsp; the ground, independent of the testimony of&nbsp; the several other credible witnesses for&nbsp; the&nbsp; prosecution.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; court&nbsp; gives entire credence to the testimony of&nbsp; these two witnesses,&nbsp; the snipe hunters, and there was nothing in their demeanor or that of any other witness for the prosecution&nbsp; that indicates in any&nbsp; way that they were on the stand to tell anything but the truth.&nbsp; There are no indicia that they or either of them had&nbsp; any motive&nbsp;&nbsp; whatever to swear falsely&nbsp; against&nbsp; the accused."</blockquote>In a&nbsp; conflict of testimony&nbsp; such as is presented&nbsp; in this case, this court must depend to a considerable extent upon the&nbsp; discernment&nbsp; of the judge who sits&nbsp; at the&nbsp; trial.&nbsp; A careful&nbsp; and discriminating trial&nbsp; judge&nbsp; has unequaled advantages in determining the relative credibility of opposing witnesses.&nbsp; If he exercises his faculties with shrewdness and&nbsp; sagacity, he&nbsp; performs a most&nbsp; valuable work for the appellate court.&nbsp;&nbsp; We have considered this case in&nbsp; a&nbsp; very painstaking manner.&nbsp; We have searched the record for any evidence indicating that the learned trial court was mistaken in his judgment&nbsp; as to&nbsp; the relative&nbsp; credibility of the witnesses or that he&nbsp; had overlooked&nbsp; some fact or circumstance of weight or influence in passing&nbsp; upon the evidence, or that he had misinterpreted the significance of the facts as proved. We&nbsp; have been unable&nbsp; to&nbsp; find from&nbsp; the record&nbsp; that&nbsp; the learned trial court has&nbsp; fallen into such error; and, in accordance with the rule&nbsp; which we have so often laid down, namely, that this&nbsp; court will not interfere with the judgment of the trial court in passing upon&nbsp; the&nbsp; relative credibility of opposing&nbsp; witnesses&nbsp; unless&nbsp; there&nbsp; appears in the record some fact or circumstance of weight&nbsp; and influence which has&nbsp; been overlooked or its&nbsp; significance&nbsp; misinterpreted&nbsp; by him, we decline to interfere with the judgment of the trial court upon the facts in this case.<br><br>The penalty in this&nbsp; case is extremely severe.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; injury done to the building&nbsp; was no more than P80.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was not a&nbsp; dwelling&nbsp; house,&nbsp; although a family&nbsp; happened to&nbsp; be living&nbsp; in it at the time.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is unmistakable, however, that the crime committed falls within the&nbsp; provisions of article 550, subdivision&nbsp; 2, and article&nbsp; 551, subdivision&nbsp; 1, Penal Code, and these&nbsp; articles fix for said crime the penalty&nbsp; of <span style="font-style: italic;">presidio&nbsp; mayor.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; There being&nbsp; present&nbsp; the aggravating circumstance of nocturnity and no extenuating circumstance, the penalty must be imposed in the maximum degree.<br><br>The penalty imposed by&nbsp; the learned trial&nbsp; court being within the law and the facts&nbsp; fully&nbsp; substantiating his&nbsp; conclusions, the&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; is&nbsp; affirmed,&nbsp; with costs against the appellants.<br><br><i>Arellano, C.
