				<BR><BR><p>By a written complaint of April 16, 1913, subsequently twice amended, counsel 
for the brother and sisters, Nicasio, Juana and Petronila, all surnamed Cabello, 
filed suit in the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Sur, against their aunt 
Engracia Cabello, and alleged that they were grand-children of Pedro Cabello, 
who died intestate in 1860, leaving <em>pro indiviso</em> five parcels of land, 
described in paragraph 2 of the complaint; that, as such relatives of the said 
Pedro Cabello, they were his forced heirs in concurrence with their aunt, the 
defendant Engracia Cabello, a daughter of their grandfather, Pedro Cabello; 
that, after the latter's death, his children, among them the plaintiffs' father, 
continued in the possession of said parcels of land, but that upon the death of 
the brothers and sister of the defendant Engracia without leaving any lawful 
heir except one Lorenzo, who died intestate and was survived by the three 
children who are the herein plaintiffs, said defendant Engracia, in 1894, 
appropriated for herself all the lands constituting the hereditary estate of 
Pedro Cabello, under promise to deliver to the plaintiffs in money the 
equivalence of the products of the lands that belonged to them, which promise 
the defendant had not fulfilled up to the time of the filing of the complaint; 
that the lands in question yielded a net, annual income of P200; and that, 
notwithstanding the several demands made by the plaintiffs upon this defendant 
to deliver to them the total amount of their share of the net profits derived 
from said real estate, she had refused so to do, thereby causing them other 
damages estimated at P300. Said counsel therefore asked that judgment be 
rendered—(<em>a</em>) holding the plaintiffs to be entitled to one-half of the 
estate left by their grandfather, Pedro Cabello; (<em>b</em>) ordering said 
defendant to pay the plaintiffs the sum of P628, the total value of the 
uncollected share of the products which should belong to them; (<em>c</em>) 
ordering the partition of the property in litigation; and, (<em>d</em>), 
ordering the defendant also to pay the plaintiffs the sum of P300 for losses and 
damages caused them, and to pay the costs of the trial.</p>
<p>Engracia Cabello made a general and specific denial of all the allegations 
contained in the complaint, and in special defense alleged that the estate left 
by her father Pedro Cabello had already been partitioned among his heirs, more 
than 30 years ago; that the land described under the letter (<em>c</em>) in 
paragraph 2 of the complaint, belonged to her absolutely and exclusively and was 
then in her possession, as she had inherited it from her father; that, besides 
the said parcel of land (<em>c</em>) claimed by her, she had no interest in any 
of the other real estate described in the complaint; and that by the present 
complaint she had incurred losses and damages amounting to P150. She therefore 
requested to be absolved from the complaint, and that the plaintiffs be ordered 
to pay P150 for losses and damages, and<br>also the costs.</p>
<p>On October 27, 1913, the case was heard. Three witnesses testified for the 
plaintiff. The defendant Engracia Cabello was a witness in her own behalf. Both 
litigating parties were represented by their respective counsels. The plaintiffs 
introduced evidence to prove that they were the children and sole heirs of 
Lorenzo Cabello; that the latter was the son of Pedro Cabello whose other 
children were Simon Cabello, Regina Cabello, and the defendant Engracia Cabello; 
that Lorenzo died first, then Regina, and afterwards, about the month of August, 
1912, Simon, all of whom, except Lorenzo, died intestate and without any forced 
heir; that the plaintiffs, are Lorenzo's heirs; and that the defendant Engracia 
Cabello, the plaintiffs' aunt of full blood, is the only surviving daughter of 
Pedro Cabello.</p>
<p>From the evidence adduced by the plaintiffs it was also shown that said Pedro 
Cabello died intestate, leaving to his children four undivided parcels of land 
which had an annual yield of 5 <em>uyones</em> of rice and were held <em>pro 
indiviso</em> by these children, who divided their products among themselves; 
that in 1894 the defendant Engracia stipulated with the plaintiffs that she 
would take possession of the lands which might pertain to them but that such 
possession was conditional on her making delivery to them annually of the 
equivalence in cash of the plaintiffs' share of the crop, which condition the 
defendant Engracia did not fulfil, but, instead, kept for herself all the 
property derived from Pedro Cabello from the time of the death of the last of 
his children, Simon Cabello, who died in 1912.</p>
<p>The defendant Engracia Cabello testified that the land in Orense, pueblo of 
Narvacan, specified under letter (<em>a</em>) in the complaint, was then held by 
the plaintiffs themselves; that the lot with the house standing on. it, in the 
same barrio of Orense, Narvacan, designated in the complaint by the letters 
(<em>b</em>) and (<em>c</em>), belonged to her brother Simon Cabello, who, while 
still living, had conveyed it to Buenaventura Cabansag, as a gift; that the 
<em>sementera</em> or rice field in the barrio of Dasay of the same pueblo of 
Narvacan—land mentioned under letter (<em>d</em>) of the complaint—also belonged 
to Simon Cabello, who likewise conveyed it to Josefa Cabral, as a gift, and that 
the latter was then in possession thereof; and that the land described in the 
complaint, under letter (<em>e</em>) was in her possession, for the reason that 
it was allotted to her in the extra-judicial distribution made of the property 
of the estate left by her father, Pedro Cabello (record, pp. 22-23). It is to be 
noted, however, that, as the predecessor in interest Pedro Cabello left only 
four parcels of land, one of them would correspond to each of his four children; 
but the defendant Engracia testified that the lands designated in the complaint 
by the letters (<em>b</em>) and (<em>d</em>) and which are those donated to 
Buenaventura Cabansag and Josefa Cabral, respectively, were inherited by her 
brother Simon from his father Pedro Cabello. This explanation on the derivation 
of the title to the lands now held by said donees is not very satisfactory.</p>
<p>In view of the evidence produced at the trial and of the fact that two of the 
disputed parcels of land were in the possession of other persons, the court, by 
an order of October 27, 1913, directed the plaintiffs to amend their complaint 
by including therein as defendants Buenaventura Cabansag and Josefa Cabral. The 
plaintiffs therefore filed a new complaint in which said Josefa Cabral and 
Buenaventura Cabansag, together with the latter's husband, Ariston Cabello, 
appeared as defendants.</p>
<p>The defendant Josefa Cabral, in answer to the amended complaint, alleged that 
she had no interest whatever in any of the real properties in question, also 
that she had acquired no land at all from the deceased Simon Cabello. The other 
defendants, Engracia Cabello, and the spouses Ariston Cabello and Buenaventura 
Cabansag, filed a general denial of all the allegations of the amended 
complaint, and in special defense alleged that they were unacquainted with the 
lands claimed in the complaint, but that if the plaintiffs referred to, and 
claimed (<em>a</em>) the <em>sementera</em> situated in the barrio of Maruzo, 
(<em>b</em>) the <em>sementera</em> in the barrio of San Pablo, (<em>c</em>) the 
vegetable garden located in the barrio of Orense, (<em>d</em>) the lot situated 
in the same barrio, and (<em>e</em>) the house built on said lot, all within the 
district of the town of Narvacan, Ilocos Sur, then they would allege that said 
properties all belong exclusively to Buenaventura Cabansag by reason of her 
having acquired them by gift from Simon Cabello y Cabanit, who inherited them 
from his father Pedro Cabello, with the exception of the lot and house 
designated by the letters (<em>d</em>) and (<em>e</em>), which exclusively 
belonged to her; that said properties had been the subject of an extra-judicial 
partition made among the heirs of said Pedro Cabello more than 30 years ago, by 
virtue of which partition Lorenzo Cabello, plaintiffs' father, received as his 
hereditary share four parcels of land (more specifically described in paragraph 
5 of said written answer) ; that the first and second of said parcels were held 
by the plaintiffs, and the third and fourth parcels, by Fetronilo Cabebe and 
Isidora Viloria, respectively, as having acquired them by purchase from their 
former owner, Lorenzo Cabello, plaintiffs' predecessor in interest, a long time 
prior to his death. The defendants, therefore, asked that they be absolved from 
the complaint, with the costs against the plaintiffs.</p>
<p>Upon a rehearing of the case, notice having been given and appearance made by 
counsel for both parties, two witnesses for the plaintiffs testified that the 
lot and house described in the complaint under the letters (<em>b</em>) and 
(<em>c</em>) belonged to the undistributed estate left by Pedro Cabello, said 
house and lot having been occupied by the latter's son, Simon Cabello, although 
the house was kept in repair by the children of Pedro Cabello, which latter, now 
deceased, occupied while living the house erected on said lot and this property 
still remained undivided among the heirs of Pedro Cabello. After the 
cross-examination of these witnesses by counsel for the defendants and the 
determination of the introduction of evidence by the plaintiffs, said counsel, 
in representation of the aforesaid defendants, waived his right to present 
evidence in support of the allegations contained in his answer.</p>
<p>On December 8, 1913, the court rendered judgment in which he held that the 
estate left by Pedro Cabello at his death had not yet been distributed among his 
heirs and was now in the possession of the defendant Engracia Cabello, and that 
the property described in her answer and which is alleged to have been donated 
to Buenaventura Cabansag by Simon Cabello, is not the property claimed in the 
complaint. The court, besides, found no proof of the defendant's averment that 
said Simon Cabello had also donated another parcel of land to Josef a Cabral, 
for such alleged donation was denied by the latter. The court, therefore, held 
that the plaintiffs—the heirs of Lorenzo Cabello, who was a brother of Engracia 
Cabello—are entitled, jointly with their aunt Engracia Cabello, to a share of 
the undivided estate left by their common predecessor in interest. In compliance 
with the order contained in the aforementioned judgment, the commissioners 
appointed for the purpose presented to the court a proposed scheme of partition 
of the estate, which was approved by the judgment of August 28, 1915, by which 
the plaintiffs were awarded one-half of the estate left by their grandfather, 
Pedro Cabello, and the other one-half of it, to the latter's daughter, Engracia 
Cabello, who is the plaintiffs' aunt.</p>
<p>From this judgment of December 8, 1913, and the order approving the proposed 
scheme of partition of the estate in question, an appeal was taken to this court 
by the defendants Engracia Cabello, Buenaventura Cabansag, and the latter's 
husband, Ariston Cabello. Josefa Cabral acquiesced in both said judgment and 
order, as being just and lawful.</p>
<p>The defendants and appellants alleged that the trial court erred, in taking 
into account, as evidence presented against the defendants, that taken at the 
hearing of October 27, 1913, and which was produced solely against the then 
defendant Engracia Cabello, the testimony of the two new witnesses presented at 
the second hearing being insufficient to prove the allegations of the complaint 
against all the present defendants; and that the lower court also erred in not 
according due weight to the plea of prescription set up by the defendants, 
inasmuch as, for 18 years, from 1894 to 1913, Engracia Cabello had been in 
adverse possession of the lands in litigation.</p>
<p>When the interested parties who may be seriously affected by the decision of 
a suit, having been duly summoned, intervene therein, and take part in the 
proceedings at any stage thereof, and their counsel assumes the duty to inform 
himself of the proceedings had up to that time and of the pleadings made by the 
other parties, and, if evidence of the results thereof has already been 
introduced, and there was no express petition by the party in interest nor a 
previous order of the trial judge, they are not entitled to expect a repetition 
of the evidence already taken, for the party who preferred not to avail himself 
of his right must be reputed and held to conform to the status of the case and 
to the results and merits of the same.</p>
<p>The new defendants Buenaventura Cabansag and her husband Ariston Cabello 
entered their appearance in court, answered the complaint and in their answer 
raised questions which they submitted to the decision of the court; the 
defendants' counsel took part in the hearing, cross- examined the plaintiffs' 
new witnesses and had full and ample opportunity to defend his clients and prove 
the pleas that he had made, though he waived his right to present proofs, 
perhaps because he had none (rec, p. 39).</p>
<p>The provisions of articles 109 and 110 of the Code of Civil Procedure 
authorize the court, should he deem it necessary, to order the amendment of any 
pleading during or after the trial so that it may be in accord with the proof, 
or for the purpose of correcting errors which do not affect the essential rights 
of the parties, or for any other just and lawful purpose. The Supreme Court of 
Montana, in the case of Merrill <em>vs</em>. Miller (28 Mont., 134), held that: 
"It was not error for the court to permit an amendment to the complaint, after 
denial of a motion for nonsuit on plaintiff's evidence and before judgment, 
where no hardship or surprise to defendant was shown, and where no change of the 
issue resulted."</p>
<p>In the case of Morrissey <em>vs</em>. Faucett (28 Wash., 52) the Supreme 
Court of the State of Washington held that, "the action of the court in 
permitting plaintiff at the close of the testimony to amend her complaint so as 
to correspond to the proof was not error, where defendant's answer theretofore 
filed had negatived the truth of the matters set up in the amendment and 
evidence upon both sides had been directed to that issue."</p>
<p>The Supreme Court of Colorado, in the case of Jordan <em>vs</em>. Greig (33 
Colo., 360), decided that the court was authorized, and it was not error, to 
allow the plaintiff, after the hearing of the evidence in a case, to file an 
amended complaint, and for the court further to order the reopening of the case 
for the taking of such additional evidence as the parties might desire to 
present; and that, "the bringing into an action of a new and additional party 
defendant by an amended complaint is not reversible error where the new 
defendant made no objection, and the original defendants failed to show that 
they were in any way injured or prejudiced thereby."</p>
<p>From the foregoing it is evident that the rights of the new defendants in 
this action have in no manner been prejudiced, for the case was reopened and 
they had every opportunity to defend themselves and to adduce proof, had they 
wished so to do. It is also to be noted that they were represented by the same 
attorney who represented the original defendant Engracia Cabello.</p>
<p>With respect to the prescription alleged by the defendant party on account of 
Engracia Cabello having been in material and adverse possession of the litigated 
properties from 1894 to 1913 when the complaint was filed, that is, for a period 
of 18 years, it is well known that among co-heirs the action to demand the 
division of the inheritance does not prescribe, as provided by article 1965 of 
the Civil Code, since the possession held by a coheir of the undivided estate is 
understood to be enjoyed in the name of the rest of the heirs.</p>
<p>For the foregoing reasons, whereby the errors assigned to the judgment 
appealed from are deemed to have been refuted, and said judgment being in accord 
with the law and the evidence of record, they should be, as they are hereby, 
affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellants. So 
ordered.</p>
