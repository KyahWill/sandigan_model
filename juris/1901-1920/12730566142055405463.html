				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The plaintiff, a married woman, brought this action in her own name, without&nbsp; joining her husband, to recover the possession of a steamboat, alleged to be her exclusive property, and for damages&nbsp; for the wrongful&nbsp; detention of the same. The fact of plaintiff's coverture does not appear on the face of the complaint but it was raised by answer, and one of the special&nbsp; defenses in&nbsp; the answer was that plaintiff has no capacity to sue, this&nbsp; special&nbsp; defense being based on&nbsp; the provisions of section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br><br>Judgment was rendered in favor of the defendant company, dismissing the complaint, with costs, on&nbsp; the ground that the plaintiff did not have the legal capacity to bring this action without joining her husband. The plaintiff appealed and during the pendency&nbsp; of the appeal this&nbsp; court, upon motion, allowed the plaintiff to&nbsp; amend her complaint by striking out&nbsp; that&nbsp; part which refers to&nbsp; damages for&nbsp; the alleged&nbsp; illegal&nbsp; detention of the steamer, leaving as&nbsp; the subject&nbsp; matter of the action the steamer only,;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before&nbsp; the amendment was made plaintiff's husband ffiad&nbsp; an interest or&nbsp; right&nbsp; in the income from this&nbsp; steamer.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Quison <i> vs.</i> Salud, 12 Phil. Rep., 109; arts. 1385/1401, Civil Code.)<br><br>Passing the question whether, fonder ordinary circumstances, the husband has such&nbsp; right or interest in his wife's paraphernal property, aside from&nbsp; the products, so as to make him a necessary party,&nbsp; we will proceed to determine whether or not the&nbsp; defendant company can raise the question of&nbsp; plaintiff's&nbsp; exclusive&nbsp; ownership,&nbsp;&nbsp; between herself&nbsp; and husband, of the&nbsp; steamer in question.<br><br>It appears from Exhibit A, the only evidence before us, and which is a public notarial document,&nbsp; duly executed on the 2d of July, 1907, that Manuel Veloso, m his own name and as&nbsp; the legal representative,&nbsp; by&nbsp; the proper power of attorney,&nbsp; of his wife Casiana Bismorte, and William Urquahart, the duly authorized agent and liquidator of Aldecoa &amp;&nbsp; Co., executed&nbsp; this Exhibit&nbsp; "A," which appears to have for&nbsp; its&nbsp; object at&nbsp; least a&nbsp; partial settlement of Veloso's indebtedness to Aldecoa &amp;&nbsp; Co.; that&nbsp; Veloso, as the legal representative of his wife, sold to the defendant company on the 19th of August, 1905, with the right to repurchase within&nbsp; ten&nbsp; years, various parcels of real&nbsp; estate for the sum of P6,478, said amount to be applied on Veloso's debt to defendant company; that on the same&nbsp; date&nbsp; and under the same conditions/Veloso,&nbsp; in his own name, sold to the defendant company for the sum of P13,583, to&nbsp; be applied on&nbsp; his&nbsp; debt, a number of parcels of real&nbsp; property; that in that same document, dated the 19th of August, 1905, Veloso promised to pay P2,000 a month on his indebtedness, guaranteeing this payment by, as he said, all of his property, credits, and interest which constituted his business in Leyte; that in a notarial document duly executed on&nbsp; the 3d of August, 1904, Veloso acknowledged himself to be indebted to Aldecoa &amp; Co. in certain other specified sums, guaranteeing the payment of tnese amounts with the steamer <i>San Rafael</i>, the said boat being his own property; that a final liquidation of all&nbsp; the accounts&nbsp; was made, resulting&nbsp; in Veloso&nbsp; owing Aldecoa &amp;&nbsp; Co. the&nbsp; sum of&nbsp; P129,749.65;&nbsp; that&nbsp; after this liquidation,&nbsp; and by&nbsp; virtue of this document,&nbsp; Exhibit&nbsp; A, Veloso, for&nbsp; himself and as the legal representative&nbsp; of his wife,&nbsp; by and with the consent of the legal representative of the&nbsp; defendant company, modified the former sales of the real property, with the&nbsp; right to repurchase, and converted the same into an&nbsp; absolute&nbsp; sale in favor of the defendant company, together with other specified property belonging to him, in payment&nbsp; of his indebtedness.&nbsp; Paragraphs&nbsp; (<i>e</i>) and (<i>f</i>) of this document, Exhibit A, are as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"(<i>e</i>)&nbsp; There should be&nbsp; excluded from the foregoing assignment, cession, and transfer, the steamer San Rafael,&nbsp; which will hereafter be the exclusive property of my wife, Casiana Bismorte, in consideration of the property by her&nbsp; transferred and&nbsp; assigned in&nbsp; payment&nbsp; of part of the aforesaid indebtedness.<br><br>"(<i>f)</i>&nbsp; It is further stipulated&nbsp; and agreed that&nbsp; Casiana Bismorte shall execute, within the maximum period of two months, a notarial instrument, ratifying the present one, otherwise Aldecoa&nbsp; &amp; Co. can either insist upon the validity of this instrument or&nbsp; have&nbsp; the&nbsp; same&nbsp; rescinded, leaving everything in the same&nbsp; condition&nbsp; in which it was&nbsp; prior to the execution of the present agreement, demanding payment of all the amounts due them from the said Manuel Veloso, and such interest as may have accrued thereon."<br></blockquote><br>The defendant&nbsp; now insists that it has not been shown that the property&nbsp; transferred by the plaintiff to the defendant in payment of a part of her husband's indebtedness was acquired by her separate funds, nor even that it belonged to her.&nbsp; The defendant is estopped from now raising this question, as it dealt with the&nbsp; plaintiff's husband on the theory that the plaintiff was the owner of these lands.&nbsp;&nbsp; The parties&nbsp; to&nbsp; this contract&nbsp; treated this fact as specifically settled.&nbsp; That&nbsp; the plaintiff was the owner of&nbsp; this&nbsp; real property forms a part of the&nbsp; very&nbsp; basis&nbsp; of the&nbsp; contract itself; in fact it is the basis or&nbsp; foundation of this contract as far&nbsp; as the plaintiff is&nbsp; concerned.&nbsp;&nbsp; That she was the exclusive owner of the lands can not now be questioned by the defendant.&nbsp; It is estopped&nbsp; by the&nbsp; contract itself.&nbsp; It accepted the lands as the&nbsp; property of the plaintiff, and it would now be&nbsp; against the plainest principles of justice to allow it&nbsp; to deny that the plaintiff was the exclusive owner of those lands.<br><br>According to the contract, Exhibit A, plaintiff's husband obligated himself&nbsp; to do certain things.&nbsp; He also, on behalf of his wife, obligated her to perform&nbsp; certain acts.&nbsp;&nbsp; The defendant accepted these obligations with the corresponding reciprocation.&nbsp;&nbsp; The obligations on the part of the plaintiff and her husband&nbsp; were distinct and separate.&nbsp; She had nothing&nbsp; to do with the fulfillment of this contract, except to consent to the&nbsp; conversion of the provisional sale of her lands to an absolute sale in favor of the defendant and to ratify this&nbsp; sale within the period of&nbsp; two months.&nbsp;&nbsp; She consented to the&nbsp; converting of the&nbsp; provisional sale&nbsp; into an absolute one, but the record does not show whether or not she&nbsp; executed&nbsp; a document ratifying this absolute&nbsp; sale, as provided in paragraph (<i>f), supra</i>.&nbsp; But&nbsp; this&nbsp; is&nbsp; immaterial, as the fact&nbsp; that she brought this action, seeking the fulfillment&nbsp; of&nbsp; the contract,&nbsp; is conclusive proof of her ratification, and if she never executed a document ratifying the same her conduct is a sufficient ratification.&nbsp; She therefore complied en toto with her part of this obligation.&nbsp;&nbsp; She can&nbsp; not be held responsible if&nbsp; her husband&nbsp; has&nbsp; failed to comply with his part of the contract, as no stipulation to this effect&nbsp; was made.&nbsp; The&nbsp; defendant did&nbsp; not&nbsp; demand, neither does it appear in the&nbsp; contract, that the fulfillment of same&nbsp; between it and the plaintiff would&nbsp; be dependent upon the&nbsp; husband's compliance with&nbsp; his obligations.&nbsp;&nbsp; We can&nbsp; not determine whether her&nbsp; husband has,&nbsp; in fact,&nbsp; complied with his part of the contract or not, but this is immaterial in this case.<br><br>It having been settled that the lands&nbsp; (which were&nbsp; mentioned in&nbsp; the contract as belonging to the plaintiff)&nbsp; were the&nbsp; plaintiff's exclusive&nbsp; property,&nbsp; and these&nbsp; lands&nbsp; having been exchanged, according to&nbsp; the contract, for the steamer in question, ther said steamer,&nbsp; under article 1396&nbsp; of the Civil Code, became the paraphernal or&nbsp; exclusive&nbsp; property of the plaintiff.&nbsp; The defendant specifically agreed in the contract that the steamer should become&nbsp; the exclusive property of the plaintiff,&nbsp; the consideration being the plaintiff's lands.&nbsp; Under the plain terms of this contract any defense which the defendant might set up against the&nbsp; plaintiff's husband&nbsp; for his failure to comply with&nbsp; his part&nbsp; of the contract can not be interposed against the plaintiff, as she has fulfilled her obligations.&nbsp;&nbsp; The defendant received from the plaintiff what it&nbsp; then considered a valuable consideration when&nbsp; the&nbsp; contract was&nbsp; executed,&nbsp; in so far&nbsp; as the contract&nbsp; affected the plaintiff.&nbsp; As to whether or&nbsp; not it has any meritorious&nbsp; defenses&nbsp; which are not&nbsp; stated in the contract against the plaintiff must be left for&nbsp; future determination.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was specifically agreed in the&nbsp; contract,&nbsp; as we&nbsp; have said, that&nbsp; the plaintiff&nbsp; should be the exclusive owner of the steamer&nbsp; San Rafael.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the&nbsp; face&nbsp; of&nbsp; this express agreement, the defendant seeks to avoid complying with its part of&nbsp; this obligation, in so far as the plaintiff is concerned, by now claiming&nbsp; that&nbsp; the plaintiff's&nbsp; husband has an interest&nbsp; in this&nbsp; steamer.&nbsp;&nbsp; We think that this&nbsp; is a clear case of estoppel by contract.&nbsp;&nbsp; As the defendant had agreed&nbsp; that the plaintiff&nbsp; should&nbsp; be the exclusive owner of the&nbsp; boat it should not now be&nbsp; permitted&nbsp; to&nbsp; say that her&nbsp; husband has an interest in it.The estoppel of the defendant was&nbsp; fixed&nbsp; by the&nbsp; execution&nbsp; of the&nbsp; contract. Nothing1 further need be shown where the fact in&nbsp; question, as in this case, has been clearly agreed upon.&nbsp; This position was taken by the defendant&nbsp; when it executed the contract in question. The plaintiff acted upon&nbsp; this theory.&nbsp; The defendant can not now change its position to the prejudice of the plaintiff.&nbsp;&nbsp; The defendant can&nbsp; not now deny this fact in regard to its position, it having acted with full knowledge of its rights and all the material facts.<br><blockquote>"A party can&nbsp; not either in the course of litigation or in dealings <i>in pais</i> occupy inconsistent positions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon that rule election is&nbsp; founded;&nbsp; 'a&nbsp; man shall not be&nbsp; allowed,' in the language of the Scotch law, 'to approbate and reprobate.'&nbsp;&nbsp; And where a man has an&nbsp; election between several inconsistent courses of&nbsp; action,&nbsp; he will be confined to that which he&nbsp; first adopts; the election,&nbsp; if&nbsp; made with knowledge of the facts, is in itself binding; it can not be withdrawn without due consent; it&nbsp; can not be withdrawn though&nbsp; it has&nbsp; not been&nbsp; acted upon&nbsp; by another&nbsp; b;y any change of position."&nbsp; (Bigelow on Estoppel, p. 673.)</blockquote>In the case of Daniels <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Tearney (102 U. S., 415), the suit was brought by Tearney and&nbsp; Wilson, executors&nbsp; of Collin&nbsp; C. Porter.&nbsp; The complaint set forth that&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; 1st day of&nbsp; June, 1861,&nbsp; made their joint and&nbsp; several bond whereby they bound themselves to pay to the plaintiff a certain specified sum of money when requested, and that there was a condition affixed&nbsp; to the bond which was "That, whereas on the 25th day of March, 1861, a writ fieri facias was issued from the clerk's office in the name of Porter against one&nbsp; Daniels for&nbsp; a certain sum of money,&nbsp; with interest from the 2d day of January,&nbsp; 1860, and&nbsp; costs; if, therefore, the said Daniels should&nbsp; pay&nbsp; the debt,&nbsp; interest, and costs, when the operation&nbsp; of the ordinance before mentioned&nbsp; should cease, then the obligation to be void, otherwise to be in full force."&nbsp; In April, 1861, a convention of the State of Virginia passed an ordinance of secession, and on the 30th of that month a law entitled "An ordinance to provide against the sacrifice of property and to suspend proceedings in certain cases."&nbsp; It was under this law or ordinance that the bond sued upon was&nbsp; given. When this suit was brought the defendants pleaded, among other things, the unconstitutionality&nbsp; of that statute and ordinance.&nbsp; This law&nbsp; was held by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Supreme&nbsp; Court of the United States to be directly repugnant to the constitutional provisions which forbid the impairment of&nbsp; contracts by State laws.&nbsp;&nbsp; It also held that the bond sued upon, as a statutory&nbsp; instrument, was likewise void, but held that the defendants&nbsp; were&nbsp; estopped&nbsp; from raising the question of the validity of the statute and bond, the court saying:<br><blockquote>"The principle of estoppel&nbsp; thus applied has its foundation in a wise and salutary policy.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; a means of repose. It promotes fair dealing.&nbsp; It can not be made an instrument of wrong or oppression,&nbsp; and it often gives triumph to right and justice,&nbsp; where nothing else known to our&nbsp; jurisprudence&nbsp; can, by&nbsp; its&nbsp; operation, secure&nbsp; those ends.&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the statute of limitations,&nbsp; it is a conservator, and without it society could not well go on."</blockquote>The court in quoting&nbsp; from&nbsp; the&nbsp; case of Ferguson<i> vs</i>. Landram&nbsp; (5 Bush&nbsp; (Ky.), 230), cited in the above case, said:<br><blockquote>"Upon what principle of exalted&nbsp; equity shall a man be permitted&nbsp; to receive a valuable consideration through&nbsp; a statute, procured by his own consent or&nbsp; subsequently sanctioned by him, or from which he derived an interest and consideration, and then keep the&nbsp; consideration,&nbsp; and repudiate the statute?"<br></blockquote>In applying this principle to the&nbsp; case at bar we might likewise ask&nbsp; upon what principle of exalted equity shall a&nbsp; man be permitted to&nbsp; receive a&nbsp; valuable&nbsp; consideration, through a contract, procured by his&nbsp; own consent, with full knowledge of all of his rights&nbsp; and of all the material facts, and then&nbsp; keep&nbsp; the consideration (the land in this case) and repudiate the contract?&nbsp; Parties are precluded&nbsp; from contradicting their solemn admissions or statements deliberately made in their contracts under these circumstances. The defendant company in&nbsp; this contract specifically agreed that the steamer should be the exclusive property of the plaintiff. It was upon&nbsp; this&nbsp; agreement that&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff parted with her lands.&nbsp;&nbsp; It would not&nbsp; now be just to permit it to retain the lands and question her exclusive ownership, between herself and her husband, of this boat.<br><blockquote>"It is a principle of law of universal application (and as just as it is&nbsp; general) that&nbsp; admissions, whether of. law or of fact, which have been acted upon by others are conclusive&nbsp; against the party making them, in all cases between him and the&nbsp; person whose conduct he has thus influenced; and the principle is founded upon grounds of public policy, that a&nbsp; man shall not be permitted&nbsp; to repudiate his own representations."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Toppan <i>vs.</i> Cleveland, C.&nbsp; &amp; C. K. Co., Fed. Cas. No. 14,099.)</blockquote>Under all of the facts&nbsp; before us we are irresistibly led to the&nbsp; conclusion&nbsp; that&nbsp; the defendant&nbsp; company is estopped from raising this question.<br><br>The&nbsp; judgment is, therefore,&nbsp; reversed, and the record will be&nbsp; returned to the court below for further proceedings in accordance with this&nbsp; decision, without special ruling as to costs.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J.,&nbsp; Torres,&nbsp;&nbsp; Johnson,</i> and&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Moreland,&nbsp; JJ.,</span> concur.<br></div>
