				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>One afternoon in  the month of April, 1900,  after the celebration of Holy Week, Guillermo.Balderrama and the lad Eusebio Flor Bago were walking along the road from the town of Dagupan to the barrio of Carael, Pangasinan. On reaching a bridge in the barrio referred to, several men, among whom were the petitioners, sprang out upon and stopped them.  Baderrama  was bound and immediately conducted  to the interior of  a nipa plantation, about 100 feet from the place of the assault, where he was put to death and buried.  The lad Bago was conducted to the house of Andres de  Guzman, from which, at 7 o'clock in the evening of the same day, he was carried to the bank of the  Manat River.  Here he also was seriously wounded, and  was thrown into the river.</p>
<p>It appears from  the  record that the two deceased had come from Zambales, and were going about in the town of Dagupan selling English dictionaries;  that on the afternoon in question they had come  from the house of Ynocencio Fernandez, situated in Dagupan; that, according to the testimony of several witnesses, the accused, who were then insurrectionists, Teodoro Pacheco  being a recruiting captain, seized  and killed the deceased because  it  was supposed,,  since  they sold  books written in  English, that they  were  spies of  the Americans,  this  presumption  or belief being also testified to by several witnesses.</p>
<p>It does not appear from the record that the aggressors were  impelled to kill the  deceased by  any motive other than  that  the latter  were suspected  of being spies and, therefore, traitors to the revolutionary party to which the defendants belonged.  From the foregoing statement  of facts, it may therefore be said that the two murders prosecuted herein were  of a political  character and the result of internal political hatreds between Filipinos, the defendants having  been insurgents opposed to the constituted government.</p>
<p>The case has to do with two crimes for which, under the penal  law, the  severest punishment has always been  inflicted.   However, considering the circumstances  under which these crimes  were committed and the fact that the sovereign power in  these  Islands, in view  of the  extraordinary and radical disturbance which, during the period following the year  1896, prevailed in and convulsed this country, and prompted  by the dictates of humanity and public policy, has deemed  it advisable to blot out even the shadow of a certain class of offenses, decreeing full pardon and amnesty to their authors—an act of elevated statesmanship and timely generosity, more political than judicial in its nature, intended to mitigate the severity of the law—it is uncumbent upon us, in  deciding this case, to conform our judgment to the requirements and conditions of the decree so promulgated.</p>
<p>In  view of the foregoing considerations, we decide that the above-named accused, Felipe Abalos, Teodoro Pacheco, Cristobal Tenoliar, Esteban Pacheco, and Mariano  Gonzalo, are included within the amnesty of July 4,1902.   The judge below will  be notified of  this decision, and, as soon as the defendants shall have taken the oath prescribed in the amnesty proclamation, evidence of which will be submitted to this court, they will he set at liberty.</p>
<p><em> Arellano, C.  J., Cooper,   McDonough,</em> and  <em>Mapa, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em> Willard, J.;</em></p>
<p>I dissent from the foregoing opinion with respect to the defendant Pacheco, but concur as to the others.</p>
<p>Defendants entitled to amnesty.<br>
