				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This was an action by the plaintiff  to recover of the defendant  damages  for the unlawful  appropriation  of certain crops cultivated by the plaintiff during the year 1904.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the trial the lower court found that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover and  dismissal the cause of  action with costs to the  plaintiff.</p>
<p>An examination of the evidence shows that the defendant for some  years had charge of  the <em>hacienda</em> "Fortuna," in the pueblo of Han Carlos in the Province  of Occidental Negros.   In the year 1900 the plaintiff became a  tenant upon the said <em>hacienda</em> under a verbal  contract with the defendant, by which the former was to  put  a quantity of land in cultivation and was to plant  thereon sugar cane, and  was  to  receive  one-half of  the  products.   No  time was  expressly stated for  the duration  of this contract; however, it was understood that  the  plaintiff might continue as  such tenant upon  such  <em>hacienda</em> as long  as  he lived, if he so desired.</p>
<p>The plaintiff continued upon said <em>hacienda</em>, cultivating a portion of the same until the month  of May, 1904, when, by reason  of being wounded by an attack of bandits  or highwaymen,  he was obliged to leave said <em>hacienda</em> and  go to the city of  Iloilo.   At the time the plaintiff left the said <em>hacienda</em> there was growing thereon a crop of cane which he had planted and cultivated; the extent and value of said cane is not dearly estimated by the proof adduced in said cause.</p>
<p>During the time between the year 1900  and .May, 1904, the plaintiff had raised corn and  sugar  cane and sold his share of the  same  to  the  defendant.   During the same period the plaintiff  had received advancements in  cash as well as in goods and merchandise from the defendant, amounting to several hundred dollars above the value of the share of tin; crops which the plaintiff had sold to the defendant.  At  the time the plaintiff left the <em>hacienda</em> there was a liquidation of the accounts between him and the defendant, which, liquidation  showed that there was due from  the  plaintiff'  to  the defendant  the sum  of 1,021.29 pesos.</p>
<p>The defendant claims and undertook to prove that this indebtedness of the plaintiff to him was canceled by virtue of the plaintiff turning over to the defendant his share of the then growing crop on the said <em>hacienda</em>, which had been planted and cultivated by the plaintiff.   Later in the year 1904  the  defendant  took possession  of said  crops and harvested the same and  appropriated  the results  to  his own use.</p>
<p>The plaintiff claims and undertakes to prove that when he left the aaid <em>hacienda</em> in the month of May it was agreed between him and the defendant that his son-in-law, one Gestorio Oaballero, was to  take charge of said  crops and harvest the same for the benefit of the  said plaintiff.</p>
<p>At the time the plaintiff left the  <em>hacienda</em> in the month of May a new account was opened between the defendant and the said Oaballero,  and the balance due  from the plaintiff to  the defendant was charged to the said Caballero.  Just what the contract was between the plaintiff and the said Caballero  does not distinctly appear by the evidence.</p>
<p>From the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause in the lower court it seems clear that whatever right  in the said crops for the year 1904 which  the plaintiff had was turned over to the said Caballero at  the time the former left the said <em>hacienda</em>, by reason of the agreement between them, and by reason of the cancellation of the account which the defendant had against the plaintiff at that time.   It would seem  from the  record that if the defendant had violated the rights of any person with reference to the crops of  the  year 1904, he  had violated the riglits which the said Caballero had in said crops.</p>
<p>The lower court found that by the arrangement which was made between the  plaintiff and the said Caballero, the debt which the plaintiff owed to the defendant on the balance  of their accounts was  extinguished by its being charged  to Caballero, the latter assuming it, and that the plaintiff thereby lost any right which he had in said crops.</p>
<p>The lower court stated in  its judgment  that the judgment in  no  way determined the right  of Caballero to demand  and recover compensation of the defendant for the value of the crop as it stood at the time the said defendant took possession of the same.</p>
<p>The judgment of the  lower court is therefore affirmed with costs.  After the expiration of twenty days let judgment be entered in accordance herewith and ten days thereafter the cause be remanded to. the lower court for proper action.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres,  Mapa, Carson, Willard,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
