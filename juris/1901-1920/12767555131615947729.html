				<BR><BR><div align="justify">ACTION FOR RECOVERY OF PERSONAL PROPERTY; STATUE OF LIMITAIONS. â€” From the Court of First Instance of Batangas. Powell, J.<br><br>Plaintiff sought to recover the possession of a piano and damages for retention.&nbsp; Defendant alleged possession as owner from 1902 to the date of the trial, and set up the statute of limitations.&nbsp; The proofs show, conclusively, that the plaintiff was formerly the owner of the piano, that he sent it to Manila for the purpose of having it repaired, and that defendant took possession of it, claiming a right to it because of a debt owing to him by the plaintiff.&nbsp; Under section 43 of the Code of Civil Procedure the action which should have been commenced within four years, held to have prescribed. Judgment affirmed.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Per Moreland, J.</span><br>For appellant: Fernando Leyco.<br>For appellee: Diokno &amp; Causing.</div>
