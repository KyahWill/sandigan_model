				<H3>IN RE GUARDIANSHIP OF THE MINORS FELIPE AND ANTONIO TAMBOCO, TAN ENG AND TAN LINJO. DONATO CHUATONGCO, APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>STREET, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Upon January 1,1910, Justina Plaza of Surigao, Surigao, widow of Tamboco, in 
the exercise of her functions as guardian of the person and property of the 
minor children of her deceased husband, delivered to the mercantile firm of 
Quian Sieng &amp; Co., the sum of P2,241.32, belonging to said minors. For the 
sum of money so delivered, the appellant Donato Chuatongco, as manager of said 
firm, executed and delivered to Justina Plaza a receipt of the following 
tenor:
<blockquote>
<p>"I hereby certify that the mercantile firm Quian Sieng &amp; Co. has received 
from Justina Plaza, widow of Tamboco, in her capacity of guardian of the persons 
and property of the minor children of said Tamboco, the sum of two thousand, two 
hundred and forty-one pesos and thirty-two centavos owing to the said estate, of 
which sum said firm will render an account to the interested party [Justina 
Plaza] as soon as she so requires.</p>
<p>"Surigao, <em>January 1, 1910.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="right">(Sgd.) "DONATO 
CHUATONGCO."</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>Upon November 7, 1914, the judge of the Court of First Instance of the 
Province of Surigao, in the exercise of the jurisdiction of that court over the 
guardianship of said minors, made an order requiring Donato Chuatongco to pay 
the money which he had received from Justina Plaza into the Postal Savings Bank 
or the Agricultural Bank in the name of the minors referred to, and also 
requiring him, in case of the impossibility of making such payment, to provide 
security for the payment thereof by giving a duly registered and approved 
mortgage upon real property of the value of not less than P3,000.</p>
<p>Chuatongco seems to have been unable either to find or furnish the security 
required of him, and he therefore did not obey the order of the court. 
Accordingly after a certain period of indulgence, the court made an order upon 
March 27, 1915, to the effect that the said Chuatongco should be arrested and 
committed to jail until he should comply with said order, or until he should be 
put at liberty according to law. The accused excepted to said order, gave bail 
pending appeal to this court, and now assigns error to the action of the lower 
court in making the order in question.</p>
<p>We are of the opinion that the order appealed from was unauthorized. It is 
true that section 611 of the Code of Civil Procedure gives a court exercising 
probate jurisdiction the power to commit a person to jail for failure to obey 
its order, sentence, or decree; but it is declared in the proviso to the same 
section that nothing therein shall be construed to authorize imprisonment for 
ordinary debt.</p>
<p>It is evident that the receipt executed by Donato Chuatongco in favor of 
Justina Plaza is a mere acknowledgment of indebtedness, and that the delivery of 
the money to him constituted a loan. The transaction in question therefore 
created an ordinary debt, such as is contemplated in the proviso to section 611 
of the Code of Civil Procedure. That the transaction in question does not 
constitute a technical deposit is also apparent from the circumstance that it 
was agreed between the parties that the firm of Quian Sieng &amp; Co. should pay 
interest at the rate of P100 per annum; from which it is manifest that the firm 
had the right to utilize the money in its business, as was in fact done. This 
constitutes a loan. (Garcia Gavieres <em>vs</em>. Pardo de Tavera, 1 Phil. Rep., 
71; Baretto <em>vs</em>. Reyes, 10 Phil. Rep., 489.) The agreement for the 
payment of interest in this case was not expressed in the receipt, but this is 
not material. Furthermore, if the money was used by the firm with the consent of 
Justina Plaza, as appears to have been the case, the obligation was converted 
into a loan under article 1768 of the Civil Code even supposing that it had 
originally been a deposit.</p>
<p>It follows from the foregoing opinion that the order of the court below, 
dated March 27, 1915, committing the appellant, Donato Chuatongco, to jail for 
failure to comply with its prior order dated November 7, 1914, was improper and 
should be vacated, with costs of this instance <em>de officio</em>. So 
ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Johnson, Carson, Araullo</em>, and <em>Malcolm, 
JJ.</em>, concur.</p></div>
