				<H3>E. MICHAEL & CO., INC., PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. ADRIANO ENRIQUEZ, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MORELAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Cebu dismissing the action after trial on the ground that the plaintiff did not prove facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.<br><br>We are of the opinion that the judgment must be reversed and a new trial ordered.<br><br>The action is based on a sale with a right to repurchase made by Adriano Enriquez in favor of E. Michael and E. Michael &amp; Co., sociedad en comandita, of which appellant claims to be the successor, by reason of an instrument, duly executed and delivered by said companies to appellant, transferring property, business and assets of every kind, including the land which is the subject of this'litigration. It is alleged in the complaint that the time to repurchase having expired, the title to the property became absolute in appellant and that it is accordingly the owner of the land described in said instrument. On the trial appellant sought to prove the execution and delivery of the conveyance transferring to it the land described in the sale with right to repurchase. The trial court prevented appellant from proving that fact. Appellant also attempted to prove the fact that the instrument so executed and delivered was lost, it being his purpose to lay the basis for the introduction of secondary evidence as to its contents. The trial court also prevented appellant from proving that fact.<br><br>While the efforts of appellant's counsel to prove the execution and delivery of the document were at times rather informal and inartificial and objections to such questions were properly sustained, at others the questions put for the purpose of proving those facts were well framed and answers should have been allowed to them; but, even in such cases, the trial court also sustained objections to the questions and the evidence sought to be adduced was excluded. The same may be said with respect to the attempts to establish the loss of the document. Exceptions were taken by plaintiff's counsel to all adverse rulings of the court respecting the admission of evidence tending to establish the execution and delivery and the subsequent loss of the document in question, thus laying the proper foundation for bringing up the rulings of the court on those matters.<br><br>Trial courts do well in refusing at all times to permit the introduction of incompetent evidence and particularly secondary evidence of the contents of written instruments unless the facts required by the Code of Civil Procedure as the conditions precedent for such evidence are clearly shown to exist. Section 321 of the Code provides: "An original writing must be produced and proved, except as otherwise provided in this Act. If it has been lost, proof of the loss must first be made before evidence can be given of its contents. Upon such proof being made, together with proof of the due execution of the writing, its contents may be proved by a copy or by a recital of its contents in some authentic document, or by the recollection of a witness."<br><br>As will be seen from this section, the writing itself must be produced unless it has been lost or destroyed, in which case, before its contents may be proved by other evidence, it must be shown by the person offering the secondary evidence (1) that the document was duly executed and delivered, where delivery is necessary, and (2) that it has been lost or destroyed. The execution and delivery of the document may be established by the person or persons who executed it, by the person before whom its execution was acknowledged, or by any person who was present and saw it executed and delivered or who, after its execution and delivery, saw it and recognized the signatures; or by a person to whom the parties to the instruments had previously confessed the execution thereof. The destruction of the instrument may be proved by any person knowing1 the fact. The loss may be shown by any person who knew the fact of its loss, or by anyone who has made, in the judgment of the court, a sufficient examination in the place or places where the document or papers of similar character are usually kept by the person in whose custody the document lost was, and has been unable to find it; or who has made any other investigation which is sufficient to satisfy the court that the instrument is indeed lost. If it appears, on an attempt to prove the loss, that the document is in fact in existence, then the proof of the loss or destruction fails and secondary evidence is inadmissible unless section 322 of the Code of Civil Procedure should be applicable. After proper proof of the due execution and delivery of the instrument and its loss or destruction, oral evidence may be given of its contents by any person who signed the document, or who read it, or who heard it read knowing, or it being proved from other sources, that the document so read was the one in question. Such evidence may also be given by any person who was present when the contents of the document were talked over between the parties thereto to such an extent as to give him reasonably full information as to its contents; or the contents may be proved by any person to whom the parties to the instrument have confessed or stated the contents thereof; or by a copy thereof; or by a recital of its contents in some authentic document.<br><br>Objections were sustained by the trial court to several questions put by appellant's counsel relative to the due execution and delivery of the instrument of transfer between the partnership of E. Michael &amp; Co., <i>sociedad en comandita,</i> and appellant, on the ground that counsel, in an attempt to identify the document to which his question referred, described or characterized it as an instrument of transfer or cession. Counsel, if he had desired'to identify the instrument to whichithe question referred, might have done better,, perhaps, if he had asked the "wibmess if he /knew of the .execution of an instrument between appellant and its predecessor in interest relating to the Hands described in the complaint or to the property and business of E. Michael &amp; Co., <i>sociedad en omandita,</i> instead of .asking him if he knew of the execution .of a document between appellant and hiB predecessors in interest transferring the 'lands in question, or the property and business of E. Michael &amp; Co., sociedad etiicomandita, to Appellant. Having obtained an affirmative answer to the question indicated counsel oould then have shown how the witness came to know of the execution or existence of the document, and if such circumstances disclosed that the witness was sufficiently acquainted with the facts,, he would have been .allowed to testify to its execution and delivery. After this had been done the document might then have been presented for identification and, when identified, offered in .evidence. If its contents showed that it referred to the lands described in the complaint, its admi ssibiJity would have been instantly evident.<br><br>The mere fact that counsel for appellant, in putting his question to the witness, characterized or described the,instrument as one of transfer, while objectionable, was not sufficient to cut him off altogether from proving the execution and delivery of the document if other requisites were present. While it is always best to avoid characterizations of that kind, its harm is minimized where the case is tried before a court instead of a jury, the court well knowing that it cannot accept the characterization as evidence but must go to the document itself or the evidence of its contents to determine its nature and legal effect. Trial courts should not be so strict with reference to matters of the character under discussion as to cause a miscarriage of justice; but, on the other hand, they should see to it that they are not imposed on by the introduction of fabricated testimony and that injustice shall not result from an evasion of the rules of evidence by designing persons.<br><br>We are of the opinion on the whole record that proper questions, tending to the production of very material and competent evidence, were put by plaintiff's counsel, objections to which were sustained by the trial court; and that the error thus committed was npt cured by subsequent questions and answers or by the introduction of the same evidence in different manner or form.<br><br>The judgment must be reversed and a new trial ordered, without costs in this instance. So ordered. <br><br><i>Arellano, C.J., Torres, Carson, Trent,</i> and <i>Araullo, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><i>Judgment reversed; new trial ordered.</i></div>
