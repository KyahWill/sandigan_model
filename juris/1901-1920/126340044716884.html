				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The defendant was charged with the crime of a criminal attempt against an  agent of the  authorities, committed as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"That on or  about the  3d  day of August, 1904, in the city of  Manila, Philippine Islands, and within the police jurisdiction of the said city, the said Joseph  J.  Capurro did then and there,  willfully, unlawfully, feloniously, and with craft, fraud, disguise, and deliberate  premeditation, attack, employ force against, gravely intimidate, and otter grave resistance  to an agent  of  the authorities of the Government of the Philippine Islands, to wit, one George E.  Shannahan, a duly appointed, qualified,  and acting postal clerk of the Government of the Philippine  Islands in the Manila and Dagupan Railway post-office, who was then and there in  the discharge of the functions of his office as such postal clerk in the mail car of a regular train of the said Manila  and Dagupan Railway, in this,  to wit : That the said Joseph J. (Japurro did then and there  enter the mail car aforesaid, where  the said George E. Shannahan was discharging the functions of his office assorting, guarding, and caring for the mail then and there  carried in said car, and did then and  there employ force against, gravely  intimidate,  lay hands  upon,  assault, beat,  and strike the said George E. Shannahan with a dangerous and deadly weapon, to wit, a heavy club and  a heavy  glass bottle filled with  water, and did then and there inflict on the head  and body of the said  George  E.  Shannahan serious  and painful wounds  and  bruises  and compelled the said George  E. Shannahan, by reason of and  as a consequence of said force  employed, to yield to the  exactions of the said  Joseph J. Capurro and permit the said Joseph J. Capurro to ransack and  search the mail  in said car in the care and custody of the said George E. Shannahan and break open and  mutilate registered  letters, envelopes, and packages contained in said mail."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This complaint  was signed and duly sworn to by the said George E. Shannahan.</p>
<p>To this complaint the defendant, through his attorney, demurred, upon the ground that the  said  complaint was defective in that  the facts therein alleged did not constitute the offepse of "assaulting an agent  of  the authorities."</p>
<p>After  a consideration of the demurrer,  the judge of the inferior  court found that the allegations contained in the complaint were sufficient to constitute the offense charged in said complaint and therefore overruled said demurrer; whereupon  the  defendant presented a  plea, which was amended so as to contain the language following:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"I plead not guilty of the offense charged and a former acquittal by a judgment rendered on the 23d of September, 1904, by the Hon. Manuel  Araullo, one of the judges of the honorable court, in Case No.  1752,  and entitled United States vs. Joseph J. Capurro et al."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No exception  was taken by the defendant in  the  court below to the order of the  judge overruling said  demurrer.</p>
<p>The judge of the inferior court withheld his decision upon the plea interposed  by the defendant of aiitrefois acquit until  after the close of the trial  of the  defendant upon the above complaint.</p>
<p>During the trial below  the defendant  presented no evidence in his defense, but did present  the complaint which had theretofore been filed against him in said case No. 1752, as well  as the judgment of acquittal rendered therein, for the purpose of supporting the plea of autrofok acquit.</p>
<p>At  the close of  the trial in this cause, the lower court overruled the plea of <em>autrefois acquit</em> and held that the defendant had not been acquitted of the crime with which he stood charged; that the complaint presented in  said  case No.  1752  was a complaint for a different  and distinct offense .rpon the issue of fact presented during the trial to the lower court, the court found  the defendant to be guilty of the crime charged and  sentenced him  to be imprisoned for the period of five years and one  month of prisions correccional.   From this decision  the defendant appealed to this court.</p>
<p>The appellant in this court makes the  following assignment of errors:</p>
<p>First. That the court erred in finding from the evidence adduced during the trial that the defendant was guilty of the crime "of a  criminal attempt against an  agent of the authorities."</p>
<p>Second. That  the court committed  an  error in overruling the plea of <em>autrefois acquit</em> presented by the defendant.</p>
<p>Third. That the Court of First Instance of the  city of Manila  had no jurisdiction to try  the appellant for the offense charged.</p>
<p>The defendant and appellant made no attempt in the court below to disprove the facts alleged in the complaint, and by his plea of <em>autrefois acquit</em> practically admitted the truthfulness of such facts.  This court then is at liberty to treat the facts stated in the complaint as true.</p>
<p>An examination of the complaint discloses the fact that at the time the defendant attacked and  employed force against the said George E. Shannahan, as  charged in the complaint,  he  (Shannahan) was a  duly appointed, qualified, and acting postal clerk of the Government of the Phil ippine Islands in the Manila-Dagupan post-office, who was, at the time of the said attack, then and there in the discharge of the  functions of his office as such clerk in the mail car of a regular train of the said Manila-Dagupan Railway.</p>
<p>Article 249 of the Penal Code provides that the following commit criminal attempts:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"1. * * *</p>
  <p>"2.  Those who attack the authorities or their agents or employ  force against them or gravely intimidate them or offer equally grave resistance Avhile they are  discharging the functions of  their office or on the occasion  thereof."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Articles 250 and 251 provide for the punishment of those who  are guilty  of the crime  charged in the  above complaint.  The defendant  and appellant in his brief quotes article 264  of the Penal Code and attempts to show that the  said George E. Shannahan was not an agent of the authorities  for the reason that he does not come within the provisions of said article 264.</p>
<p>A  careful reading of  article 264 ,will show that said article makes no attempt to define  who are agents of the authorities, but simply to include persons who might otherwise be  omitted against whom the crime described in article 249 and the succeeding articles might be committed.</p>
<p>Article 264 provides:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"For  the purpose of the articles  included  in the three preceding chapters, a person  who by himself  alone or as a member  of any corporation or tribunal shall  exercise special jurisdiction shall be considered as an authority.</p>
  <p>"The officials of the department of public prosecution â€¢shall also be considered authorities."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Article 401 of the Penal Code defines who shall be considered functionaries in the following language:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"For the purpose of this and the preceding titles of this book, every person shall be considered a public official who, by the immediate provisions of law or by popular election or appointment by competent authority,  takes part in the exercise of public  functions."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By referring again to the said complaint, it will be seen that,  the said George E. Shannahan  had been duly  appointed and had qualified and was then acting, at the time said offense was committed, as a postal clerk of the Government of the Philippine  Islands.  Admitting these allegations  to be  true,  they are sufficient  to constitute the said George E.  Shannahan  a public official.   (U. S. vs. tfarmiento,  1. Phil.  Rep., 484; U. S. vs. Fulgencio, 2 Phil. Rep., 452; U. S. vs. Cox,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 2 Off. Gaz., 110.)</p>
<p>The attack which was made upon the said Shannahan by the defendant and  appellant in the manner and form as described in said complaint was a  criminal attempt, punishable  under the provisions of  article 249 in its relation with article 251 of the Penal Code.</p>
<p>The second assignment of error made by the defendant and appellant, to wit, that the court erred in not dismissing the defendant under his plea of atitrefois acquit, or former jeopardy, presents a question pregnant with many difficulties.  The  defendant  claims that in said case  No. 1752 he had  been tried and  acquitted of the same offense  for which he was being tried in the present cause in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila.</p>
<p>The complaint presented in said case No. 1752 charges the defendant and appellant with the crime of robbery committed as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"That on or about  the  3d day of August, 1904,  in the city of Manila, Philippine Islands, and within the police jurisdiction of said city, Joseph J. Capurro and Paul A. Weems  did then and there, willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously, and with the intent of profiting thereby, and with violence and intimidation against the person of one George E.  Shannahan,  forcibly take  possession  of the following personal property, to wit:</p>
  <p>1 registered package envelope bearing the P. O. No. 60, and the contents of said package being 1  registered letter bearing the P. O. No. 79, directed to the Collector of Customs of Manila, P. I.</p>
  <p>1 registered package envelope bearing the P. O.  No.  107, and contents of said package envelope being registered letters Nos. 123 and 126, and one five-peso Conant bill.</p>
  <p>1 registered package envelope bearing the P.O. No. 50, and registered letter inclosed in said package No. 71.</p>
  <p>1 registered package envelope bearing the P. O. No. 58, and registered letter No. 77, and 30 pesos in Conant paper money, denomination of bills unknown, contained in said registered package envelope last above mentioned inclosed in said package envelope.</p>
  <p>1 registered package envelope bearing the P. O. No. 36, and registered letter No. 391, and 34 pesos in Conant paper bills, denomination of bills unknown, inclosed in  said envelope.</p>
  <p>1 registered package envelope bearing the P. O. No. 35, and registered letters Nos. 64 and 66, contained in  said package envelopeâ€”</p>
  <p>the registered package envelopes being the property of the Unted  States  Government of the Philippine Islands,  and the other articles above named being the property of various parties whose names are unknown, then and  there in the possession, care, and custody of  the  said  George E. Shannahan as custodian for the United States Government of the  Philippine Islands; that the  acts aforesaid were committed by  the said defendants, Joseph J. Capurro and Paul A. Weems, on a moving train, and the said  defendant, Joseph J, Capurro, did then and  there attack and enter a moving train then and there on the Manila and Dagupan Railway within the limits of the  city of Manila,  and did then and  there, in the execution of said acts, enter the passenger coinpartment of said car, and did then and there surprise the said George E. Shannahan,  who was a passenger and postal clerk in the service of the United States on said train and within a car of said train, and did then and there severely and purposely beat, wound, and gravely mutilate with a dangerous  and deadly weapon, to wit, a heavy bottle filled with water and a heavy club, the body of the said George  E. Shannahan in a manner  manifestly unnecessary for the execution of the acts of robbery above set forth;</p>
  <p>"That the said acts above set forth were all executed by and were the acts of the defendant, Joseph J. Capurro, and the said Paul A. Weenis was not present and did not participate directly in the execution of the acts above set forth, but the said Paul A. Weeins did then and there willfully and unlawfully  and feloniously conspire with and  induce the said Joseph J.  Capurro to execute the acts aforesaid, and did then and there cooperate with and assist the said Joseph J. Capurro  in the execution of the said  acts aforesaid by them and there providing a horse and carromata in which the said Joseph J. Capurro could and did escape and could carry away the objects above named and described, and the said Paul A. Weems was then and there watching near  by  with a horse and carromata for the purpose of assisting the said defendant, Joseph J. Capurro, as aforesaid,  and did then and  there, by means of said horse and carromata, assist him to escape after he had committed the acts aforesaid and change his blood-stained garments and to elude, evade, and  prevent  discovery,  capture,  and arrest."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At  the conclusion of  the trial of the defendant and appellant  upon this  complaint, the court  found that the defendant was not guilty of the crime of robbery as charged in said complaint, but ordered him to be detained until the prosecuting attorney  of the city of Manila  could present a complaint against him.  The court in that trial found that the defendant had assaulted the said George E. Shannahan, who was a  public official,  in the  performance of his duties, and said that this was "an act  which should not go unpunished."</p>
<p>One of the paragraphs of section 5 of an act of Congress temporarily to provide for the administration of the affairs of civil government in  the  Philippine Islands,  and for other purposes, dated July 1, 1902, provides, among other things, that:</p>
<p>"No person for the  same offense shall be twice put in jeopardy of punishment," etc.  This provision corresponds to one of the provisions of the Bill  of Rights contained in the Constitution of the United States, as well as the provisions of the bill of rights of the constitutions of the various States of the United States, and has been interpreted many times by the Supreme Court of the United  States, as well as by  the  supreme  court  of nearly every State of  the Union.</p>
<p>The  provision is that a person shall not be tried twice for the same offense.   A comparison of the complaint filed in this case with that filed in case No. 1752  will show that in the  present case the defendant was tried for the crime of "a criminal attempt against an agent of the authorities," and that the complaint presented in case No. 1752 was for the crime of "robbery."  These  facts would seem to constitute a complete answer to the argument of the defendant and  appellant that he had been placed upon trial twice for the same offense.  The defendant and appellant, however, argues that notwithstanding the fact that the offense described in each of the two complaints was a different offense, yet the facts set out in the body of the respective complaints described the same offense.</p>
<p>The  defendant cites  many  authorities to support  his contention, among the most important of which is the case of <em>In re</em> Hans Neilsen (131 U. S., 176).   In this case two indictments were found against  the defendant.   The first charged that on the 15th of October, 1885, and continuously from that time until  the 13th of  May, 1888, he did unlawfully claim, live, and cohabit with more than one woman as his  wife, to wit, Anna Lavinia  Neilsen and Caroline Neilsen.</p>
<p>The  second  indictment charged that the  defendant, on the 14th day of May, 1888, did unlawfully and feloniously coiniiiit adultery  with  one Caroline Neilsen, he being a married man, etc.</p>
<p>To the first, indictment the defendant plead guilty and wns sentenced on the 19th of November, 1888, to  be  imprisoned for three months and to pay a fine of f 100 and the  costs.  "When  the  defendant  was  arraigned  on  the second  indictment he plead not guilty  and further plead that lie had already been convicted of the offense charged in this  second indictment.   The' defendant was not  placed upon trial  on  the second  indictment until after  he had suffered the penalty imposed by the sentence under  the first indictment.   At the time of trial on the second  indictment he presented a more formal plea of autrefois  acquit and claimed that  the unlawful  cohabitation of which he had been convicted, though formally made only for  the period from October 15, 1885, to the 13th of May, 1888, <em>yet in law covered the entire period from October, 1885 to the time of the finding of the indictment September  21, 1888</em>, and thus embraced the time within which the crime of adultery was charged to have  been committed; and further averred that the said Caroline Neilsen was the same person with whom he was now charged to have committed adultery; that the unlawful  cohabitation charged in the first indictment continued without intermission until the day of the finding of the second indictment, and that the offense charged in both indictments was one and the same offense and not divisible and that he had suffered the full penalty prescribed by law.</p>
<p>It will be noted that these two indictments were for different offenses, the first for unlawful  cohabitation, covering a  definite period, and the second for the crime of adultery alleged to have been committed  the day following the end of the period covered by the unlawful cohabitation.</p>
<p>Justice Bradley, in commenting upon the identity  of the offenses charged, said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"It was not necessary to prove sexual intercourse  in order to make out a case  of unlawful  cohabitation, but this was only because proof of sexual intercourse would have been merely cumulative evidence of the fact.  Living together as man and wife  is what we decided was meant by unlawful cohabitation  under the statute.   <em>Of course, that includes sexual intercourse.  And this ican the integral part of the adultery charged in  the second indictment</em>, and was covered by and included  in the first indictment and conviction.  The case was the  same as if the first indictment had in terms laid the unlawful cohabitation for the whole period preceding the finding  of the indictment.  The conviction on that indictment was in law a conviction of a crime which was continuous, extending over the whole period, including the time when the adultery was alleged to have been committed.   The petitioner's sentence, and the punishment he underwent on the first indictment, <em>was for that entire,  continuous crime</em>.   It <em>included the adultery charged</em>.  To convict and punish him for that also was a second conviction and punishment for the same offense."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The  same judge adds, however, a statement which suggests a very important question, the following:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>"Whether an acquittal would have had the same effect to bar the second indictment is a different question on which we empress no opinion."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be noted that  the defendant  in this case was acquitted on the first complaint. And he continues:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"We are satisfied that a  conviction was a good bar and that the court was wrong in overruling the plea of <em>autrefois acquit</em>.   We  think  so  because the  material  part of the adultery charged  was comprised within the unlawful co-habitation of Avhich the petitioner was already convicted and for which he had suffered punishment."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be noted from an examination of the language used by the court that the court  intended to hold  and did hold that the crime of illegal cohabitation included the crime of adultery covering  a period up to the time of the finding of the indictment, which was many months after the time of the commission  of  the  alleged crime.  The Supreme Court of the United States in this case held that in  this particular instance  the adultery Mras  an <em>instance simply of the illegal cohabitation.</em></p>
<p>The other cases cited and relied upon by the defendant and appellant all go to establish the doctrine that where one crime is included in and forms a necessary  part  of another and is but a different degree of the same  offense, that a prosecution of one bars the otjier if a conviction  of the other might  have  been had in the same prosecution. This  is a universal doctrine and is not disputed  by any of the authorities.  There are many cases, however, which show that the same acts constitute two or more different offenses.  This rule is nowhere better stated than in the case from which we have been quoting above.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"A single act  may be an offense against two statutes and if each statute requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not, an acquittal or conviction under either statute does not exempt the defendant from prosecution and conviction under the other."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many cases have  gone  even farther than this doctrine would seem to go and have held that the same act may result in two different crimes.  For example, A, by means of a gun, kills two persons with the same shot.   Would it be contended that the  prosecution and conviction  for the killing of one person would be a bar to a prosecution for the killing of the other?  (See the case of the People vs. Majors, 65 CaL, 138.)</p>
<p>In this case the defendant, with others, in an attempt  to rob a certain house, killed two persons.  He was indicted, tried, and convicted for the murder of one of these persons and subsequently he was indicted and placed on trial for the killing of the  other.   To the  second  indictment  he pleaded the defense of <em>autrefois acquit</em> This  plea was overruled and the  defendant convicted of  the  crime  of murdering the second person.   From this decision he appealed to  the  Supreme Oourt  where  the  decision was affirmed.</p>
<p>In this case the court at page 146 said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"We have attempted to show  that the better rule, and that established by the  great weight of respectable authority, is that the murder of two persons, even by the same act, constitutes two offenses, for each of which a separate prosecution will lie  and that the conviction or acquittal in one case does not bar a prosecution in  the other."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It must  be admitted that  under these facts  the indictments must be the same, only differing in the names of the persons injured,  and the  evidence must necessarily be the same; therefore we must conclude that the offenses are not necessarily the same when the indictment and evidence are practically identical.</p>
<p>In  tie case of  Teat vs. The State (53  Miss., 439) the court, in discussing this same question,  at  page 456,  said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"It is believed that no well-considered case can be found where the putting in jeopardy for one act was held to bar another separate and distinct one merely because they were so closely connected in point of time that it was impossible to separate the evidence relating to them."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the case of Freeland vs. The People  (16 111., 380)  it was held that it was no bar to prosecution for  a riot that one of the accused had been tried, convicted, and fined for an assault and battery arising out of the same transaction or offense occurring at the same time.  (See also Severin ps. The People, 37 I11., 414.)</p>
<p>In the case of Commonwealth vs. Roby (12  Pickering, 496) the court said at page 496 in  passing upon  the  plea of <em>autrefois acquit</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Unless the first of two indictments was such  that the prisoner might have been convicted upon proof  of  facts contained in the second, an acquittal  or conviction on the first can be no bar to the second."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the case of Burns and Carey vs. The People (1 Parker Criminal Cases, 182) the supreme court of New York lays down the test of identity of offenses as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"To constitute a bar, the offenses charged in both indictments must be identically the same in law as  well as in fact."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To ,the same effect see People vs. Saunders  (4 Parker Criminal Cases, 196); Regina vs. Morris (10 Cox Criminal Cases, 480); The People vs. Alibez  (49 Cal., 452).</p>
<p>Cases <em>ad libitum</em> might be added to  the foregoing for the purpose of establishing the rule as  to the identity of offenses which constitute a bar to prosecution of another, but we think that sufficient have been cited to show what is the weight of authority upon this question.</p>
<p>With reference to the identity of offenses in this particular case, the first complaint charges the defendant with the crime of robbery simply,  in violation of one of  the provisions  of the  Penal  Code.   The second  complaint charges the defendant with the crime of a criminal attempt against an agent  of the authorities,  under another  provision of  the Penal Code.  It is true that an  examination of  the first complaint  shows  that the defendant,  in  his attempt to commit the  alleged crime of robbery, did some things wliich  are alleged to have been done by him in  the commission of the second offense.  These acts were mere incidents  in the efforts of the defendant to consummate the two crimes, punishable under different  statutes  of  the Penal Code.   AVe see no difficulty, even under  the doctrine laid down in the case of <em>In re</em> Neilsen, in holding that  the plea of auirvfoiti acquit interposed by the defendant to  the second complaint should be overruled for the  reason that, admitting the acts to be the same, the alleged  crime of  the second complaint was an offense against a different statute and therefore a different offense.  The lower court, therefore, committed no error in denying the plea interposed by the defendant in this case of <em>autrefois acquit</em>.</p>
<p>With reference  to the third assignment of error presented by the defendant and appellant, that the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila was without jurisdiction to try the defendant for the alleged offense, the complaint alleges and the proof sustains the allegation that the offense was committed within the jurisdiction  of  the city of Manila, over  which the  Court of First  Instance of the said city has jurisdiction.  No  one knew  better than the defendant just whore the alleged crime was committed, and upon  this question  he offered no proof whatever, and we  believe from the evidence and the allegations in  the complaint the lower court was justified in finding as a fact that the crime was committed within the limits of the city of Manila  and within the jurisdiction of the court.</p>
<p>Our conclusion is,  therefore,  that the defendant should he punished in accordance with article 250 in its relation to article 251 of the Penal  Code and that the penalty to be imposed is that of <em>prision  correccional</em> in its minimum to its medium degree and a line from 375 to 3,750 pesetas.</p>
<p>The said crime was committed at nighttime, and we are of the  opinion that the defendant selected this time in order that he  might the  more effectually commit  said crime.   Considering nocturnity, therefore, as an aggravating circumstance, the maximum of the penalty proyided by law must be imposed.   The maximum  penalty is  three years to four years and two months, <em>prision correccional</em>.</p>
<p>It is the judgment of the  court that the defendant should be imprisoned for a period of three years and six months and pay a fine  of 2,500 pesetas and the costs.   If the defendant has been in prison  during the pendency  of this action,  he is entitled to have one-half of  the time of such imprisonment deducted from the said period of three years and six months imposed by this court, in accordance with article 93  of the provisional  laws applicable to the Penal Code.</p>
<p>With  the foregoing modification, the judgment of the lower court is  hereby affirmed.  After the expiration of ten days let judgment be entered in  accordance herewith and ten  days thereafter the case bo returned to the lower court for execution.   So ordered.</p>
