				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>STREET, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In the year 1904 an application (No. 466) was filed by Pedro Pamintuan and 
others in the Court of Land Registration asking that certain real property 
located at Bulu, in the barrio of Santa Catalina, pueblo of Angeles, Province of 
Pampanga, be registered in conformity with the provisions of the Land 
Registration Act. Opposition in due form was made by the military authorities in 
the Philippines on behalf of the United States of America, on the ground, among 
others, that part of the land was located within the bounds of a military 
reservation. The Solicitor-General also appeared for the Government of the 
Philippine Islands and likewise opposed the registration of said land. This 
application remained pending in the Court of Land Registration for several 
years, in the course of which Mariano Vicente Henson and his wife Maria Asuncion 
Leon y Santos were substituted as parties in place of the original applicants. 
The application was first decided favorably to the applicants, but this judgment 
was reversed by the Supreme Court upon appeal; and the cause was remanded for 
further proceedings, with leave to present an amended application and new plan, 
with a view to establishing the boundaries of 92 hectares of which the court 
declared they were owners. The cause was then heard again upon additional proof 
in the Court of Land Registration. The court came to the conclusion that the 
parcel of which the applicants were supposed to be the owners could not be 
identified and that no part of the land included in the application could be 
registered in their names. Judgment was accordingly entered, upon October 29, 
1909, dismissing the application. Several months later the applicants made an 
ineffectual attempt by motion to have the judgment opened in order that they 
might present still further proofs of their title. No appeal was taken by the 
applicants either from the final judgment or from the judgment disallowing the 
motion.
<p>Upon October 20, 1912, Jose P. Henson filed his application in the present 
proceedings, praying that the land which had been the subject of the former 
proceeding should be registered in his name. It appears that the title which he 
asserts is derived by transfer from his father. The Commanding General, 
Philippines' Division, in due time appeared as opponent on behalf of the 
Government of the United States, as did also the Director of Lands, on behalf of 
the Government of the Philippine Islands, each being represented by the 
Attorney-General. The opposition of the Commanding General is primarily based on 
the contention that part of the property mentioned in the application lies 
within the boundaries of the old Military Reservation No. 10 and that no claim 
had been filed with respect to this land within the period fixed by law for the 
presentation thereof. In the opposition of the Director of Lands reliance is 
chiefly made upon the undisputed fact that the land which is the subject of the 
application is the same as that which was involved in <em>Expediente</em> No. 
466 of the Court of Land Registration, to which reference has already been made, 
and that the predecessors in interest of the present applicant were the 
applicants in said proceedings when final judgment of dismissal was rendered 
therein. This opponent accordingly in his opposition relies upon the judgment 
therein entered as a bar to the present proceeding.</p>
<p>When the cause came on to be heard on its merits on February 4,1913, the 
applicant presented his proofs of title, consisting of numerous documents and a 
voluminous mass of oral testimony. When the plaintiff rested, the 
Attorney-General in representation of the opponents moved the court to dismiss 
the application on the ground, already suggested, that the adjudication in 
<em>Expediente</em> 466 was a bar to the proceedings. Said motion was sustained, 
and by order dated October 24, 1913, the application for the registration of the 
land was dismissed. From this action of the court the applicant appealed.</p>
<p>The case raises the simple question whether the judgment of the court in 
dismissing an application for the registration of land operates to debar the 
unsuccessful claimant and persons deriving title under him from renewing the 
application later in a different proceeding; or stated in another way, does such 
a judgment constitute <em>res adjudicata</em> as between the applicant and a 
person who has successfully opposed the application? We hold that it has no such 
effect.</p>
<p>The fundamental reason why the judgment dismissing an application to register 
land can not operate as an estoppel between the applicant and his opponent is 
that, in such a proceeding, no contentious issue is made between the parties. In 
the inception of the proceeding no adversary is named as defendant or brought 
before the legal tribunal to respond to the demand. If any adverse party, 
claiming to be the owner, sees fit to appear as opponent and contest the 
registration of the land, he is permitted by law to intervene, not so much for 
the purpose of showing that he is owner as to demonstrate that the applicant is 
not. He asserts his claim in a written statement, called the opposition, to 
which the applicant makes no formal reply. As was observed in the City of Manila 
<em>vs</em>. Lack (19 Phil. Rep., 324, 334), no joinder of issue by even so much 
as a general denial is permitted.</p>
<p>The first condition of the conclusiveness of a judgment between two litigants 
is the existence of a contentious issue formulated directly between them. A 
judgment, or decree, is nothing unless it is based upon and supported by the 
issues made in the pleadings. In a certain sense there is, of course, a 
litigious controversy between the applicant and any person who opposes him in a 
proceeding to register land, since they, or their lawyers, engage in 
disputatious harangues, and their external attitude towards each other is in all 
respects the same as that of opposing litigants in ordinary actions. But when 
reference is had to their technical relations a difference is noted, which is, 
that in proceedings to register land the petitory address of each party is 
directed to the court as auditor, and no direct relief is sought against his 
adversary. It results that as between the parties there is a total absence of 
any technical issue.</p>
<p>A perception of this fact has resulted in the establishment of the 
proposition that the opponent cannot in the same proceeding obtain the 
registration of the property in his own name, though he should completely 
disprove the title of the applicant and clearly show ownership in himself. (44 
Cyc, 603.) To secure such relief, he must, so it is held, become an affirmative 
actor by filing a separate application himself. (Tecson <em>vs</em>. Corporacion 
de los PP. Dominicos, 19 Phil. Rep., 79.) The inability of the court to 
entertain a cross-complaint and decree affirmative relief to the opponent 
conclusively shows that the parties are not legal adversaries in the true sense; 
and therefore, the dismissal of the proceedings cannot operate as <em>res 
adjudicata</em> against the unsuccessful applicant.</p>
<p>Two cases heretofore decided by this court may be referred to as tending to 
establish the conclusion announced in this opinion. In the City of Manila 
<em>vs</em>. Lack (19 Phil. Rep., 324), it appears that the Court of Land 
Registration, in decreeing the registration of a parcel of land, had excluded a 
strip for the reason that it was owned by the opponent, and this fact was stated 
in the decree as the reason for its exclusion from registration. It was held 
that this adjudication did not constitute <em>res adjudicata</em> in favor of 
the opponent nor create even the slightest evidence in his favor which could be 
used by him in an action of ejectment to recover the property. Upon reference to 
the facts of this case it must be apparent that the Court of Land Registration 
clearly had jurisdiction of the proceeding, of the parties, and of the 
subject-matter; and the ownership of the strip in question was an integral part 
of the very matter in controversy. In fact every element necessary to supply the 
basis of a conclusive determination as between the parties was present except an 
issue expressed in adversary pleadings. In the case of the Roman Catholic 
Archbishop of Manila <em>vs</em>. Director of Lands and others (35 Phil. Rep., 
339), this court held that an applicant for the registration of land had the 
right to withdraw his application or present a new one after the entry of a 
judgment denying registration, although no application to withdraw the original 
application was ever made and the judgment denying registration did not purport 
to be made without prejudice.</p>
<p>Section 37 of the Land Registration Act (Act No. 496) contains a provision to 
the effect that a decree dismissing an application may be ordered to be made 
without prejudice. From this it is argued that a dismissal in general terms, 
without the saving words, must be regarded as an absolute bar to another 
proceeding. This would undoubtedly be the correct inference from that language 
as applied to ordinary actions, but the same conclusion is not appropriate in a 
proceeding where it is wholly beyond the power of the court to make a prejudical 
dismissal in any event. The omission trom the decree of the words "without 
prejudice" is therefore immaterial.</p>
<p>We are not insensible of the fact that weighty considerations may be adduced 
in favor of the proposition that a matter once litigated should not again be 
drawn in question between the same parties. <em>Interest rei publicae ut finis 
si litium</em>. This saying is undoubtedly well supported by ex* perience, and 
no judicial tribunal will lightly ignore its precept. It is believed, however, 
that when reference is had to the purposes and practical application of the Land 
Registration Act, considerations of public interest will be found largely to 
preponderate in favor of the doctrine announced in this decision. To hold that a 
decree dismissing an application for the registration of a parcel of land 
precludes the applicant and his successors in interest from ever afterwards 
renewing the application, if the party who opposed the original proceeding or 
his successors see fit to make further objection, would lead to consequences 
much impairing the usefulness of the system of registration created by said 
Act</p>
<p>In passing upon applications of this character the courts are constantly 
compelled to deny the registration of titles which are comparatively good though 
technically imperfect; and it is important that as defects are cured by the 
effluxion of time or discovery of new evidence, the owners, usually the persons 
in possession, should again present their titles for registration. Rare abuses 
may possibly occur, and sometimes a disappointed litigant, not having 
possession, may maliciously harass the occupant of a coveted parcel of ground. 
This inconvenience, or danger, in our opinion by no means offsets the beneficial 
results to be attained by encouraging owners to bring their land under the 
operation of the land registration law with all convenient dispatch. Of course 
no one could question the right of a person to renew his application upon 
acquiring a new title; and we now hold that the application can be renewed 
notwithstanding the applicant stands upon the same title that was previously 
rejected.</p>
<p>If the case should occur where a person in possession finds himself 
unreasonably molested, he will sometimes be able to meet the difficulty by 
filing an application for the registration of the land in his own name; and 
where this is not practicable, relief might possibly be found in an injunction 
against repeated vexation.</p>
<p>From what has been said it is apparent that the court below was in error in 
sustaining the, motion of the opponents to dismiss the application and in 
refusing to determine the case on its merits. Judgment must therefore be 
reserved, with costs of this instance <em>de officio</em>, and the case will be 
remanded for further proceedings in conformity with law. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson, Carson, Araullo</em>, and <em>Fisher, 
JJ.</em>, concur.</p>

<p align="center"><em><strong>DISSENTING OPINION</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>MALCOLM, J.</strong>, <em>dissenting</em>:</p>
<p>Nearly every one recognizes certain ideals of the law extremely difficult of 
attainment, but which, if the law is to be properly administered, must always be 
kept in view. One such ideal encourages citizens to avoid litigation and to 
settle their controversies amicably. Another emphasizes the wisdom, when parties 
once elect to appear before the courts, of expediting proceedings. And another 
ideal, a paramount principle of all jurisprudence, is that there should be an 
end to litigation. Feeling that the decision herein infringes on these basic 
policies of the law, I have felt it my duty to set forth briefly the reasons for 
my dissent.</p>
<p>There is no question as to the facts. Application was made in 1904 in the 
Court of Land Registration of the registration of certain land. Opposition was 
entered. After a trial on the merits extending over five years and after appeal 
to the Supreme Court, the lower court dismissed the application for the reason 
that the applicants did not have proper title for registration. About a year 
thereafter, a petition for a rehearing was made on the ground of newly 
discovered evidence. Said petition was denied on two grounds: First, because the 
applicants had had ample opportunity to introduce their evidence; and second, 
because the decision constituted a final adjudication of the case. Still later, 
a second application was made, praying that the land which had been the subject 
of the former proceedings should be registered in the name of the applicants. It 
is this second application which the Honorable Manuel Camus, judge of first 
instance, dismissed, but which this court would now permit to be heard. I 
anticipate if it were the third or the one hundred and third application and if 
forty-four instead of four judges of land registration had decided otherwise, 
the decision would be the same.</p>
<p>The Land Registration Law (Act No. 496) established a court "with power to 
hear and determine all questions arising upon such applications." Section 37 of 
the same Act is as follows:</p>
<p>If in any case the court finds that the applicant has not proper title for 
registration, a decree shall be entered dismissing the application, and such 
decree may be ordered to be without prejudice. The applicant may withdraw his 
application at anytime before final decree, upon terms to be fixed by the 
court."</p>
<p>These provisions of the law in connection with the land registration system, 
if they mean anything, mean that a proceeding for the registration of land is a 
lawsuit. There is a contentious issue between the applicant and the opponent, or 
between the applicant as against the world. The applicant says, "I am the 
owner." The opponent says, "You are not the owner." The applicant is permitted 
to withdraw his application any time before final decree. If he does not take 
advantage of this right, he is estopped thereafter as he would be in any other 
action from annoying the courts and other parties with frivolous litigation. The 
decree when entered has the same finality as any judgment unless it contains the 
words "without prejudice."</p>
<p>The judgment is made a bar on principles of public policy. The peace and 
order of society requires that a matter once litigated should not again be drawn 
in question between the same parties. Human life is short. <em>Ne lites sint 
immortales, dum litantes sunt mortales</em>. The courts carry a heavy burden 
under the most favorable circumstances. Many individuals add to that burden the 
gratification of a litigatious disposition. Other individuals would impose their 
will or neglect. Justice is at most approximate. Rightfully, if possible, but 
rightly or wrongly, there should be an end to a controversy. In the well chosen 
words of a court of higher jurisdiction:</p>
<p>"This general rule is demanded by the very object for which civil courts have 
been established, which is to secure the peace and repose of society by the 
settlement of matters capable of judicial determination. Its enforcement is 
essential to the maintenance of social order; for the aid of judicial tribunals 
would not be invoked for the vindication of rights of person and property, if, 
as, between parties and their privies, collusiveness did not attend the 
judgments of such tribunals in respect of all matters properly put in issue and 
actually determined by them." (Southern Pac. R. Co. <em>vs</em>. United States 
[1897], 168 U.S., 1.)</p>
<p>Just as sound reasons for the application of the principle of <em>res 
adjudicata</em> exist in connection with land registration cases as exist in 
connection with any other cases. The main purpose of the Land Registration Law 
is to quiet title once and forever. "Its object is to establish and declare the 
title to land as against the defendants, and to obtain a decree which shall, be 
a starting point for the statute of limitations; and in this it does not differ 
from any other suit in the nature of a suit to quiet title." (Niblack, Torrens 
System, 46.) If a person can constantly be permitted to renew an application 
once defeated, the burden on the courts, the harassing of litigants, and the 
unsettled nature of titles in the Philippines, will be beyond comprehension. On 
the contrary, from the provisions of the law above quoted, and in accordance 
with the authority of adjudicated cases, it necessarily follows that a decree of 
the former Court of Land Registration dismissing an application after a trial on 
the merits, if not appealed from, and unless ordered to be without prejudice, is 
final and conclusive upon the issues raised, or which could have been raised, by 
virtue of such application.</p>
<p>Agreeable to the foregoing, judgment should be affirmed.</p></div>
