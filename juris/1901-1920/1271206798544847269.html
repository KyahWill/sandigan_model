				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In our decision filed March 30, 1914,<span class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> 
we affirmed the judgment of the trial court convicting and sentencing the 
appellants in this case. In that decision we held that all the substantial 
contentions of counsel for appellants had been decided adversely in the case of 
the United States <em>vs.</em> Hernandez (14 Phil. Rep., 638) and the cases 
therein cited.
<p>The record is now before us upon a motion for rehearing, wherein counsel 
insists that we erred in affirming the judgment of the court below because it 
appears from the record that the fiscal failed to call certain witnesses, 
waiving his right to do so, although they had been duly cited by him to appear 
and testify at the trial. In support of his contention counsel relies on our 
ruling in the case of the United States <em>vs.</em> Tacubanza (18 Phil. Rep., 
436). In that case, wherein the accused were charged with rape, we held 
that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When the prosecution has at its disposal two disinterested witnesses to the 
alleged crime and fails to produce them at the trial, such failure, although not 
fatal, seriously weakens the case against the accused and, in the absence of the 
testimony of such witnesses, the other evidence, being interested and 
prejudiced, is not sufficient to establish guilt and the accused must be 
discharged."</p></blockquote>
<p>In the case at bar, however, the facts in question were conclusively 
established by the witnesses called at the trial, as we observed in the opinion 
already entered, and the failure to call additional witnesses to testify as to 
facts already established beyond a reasonable doubt does not and cannot sustain 
the contentions of counsel in support of their assignment of error.</p>
<p>The question as to the number of witnesses to be called to testify for the 
prosecution is one which, in the very nature of things, must be left largely to 
the sound discretion of the prosecuting officer conducting the proceedings. It 
is, of course, his duty to call all the available witnesses as to material facts 
who may be necessary to establish such facts beyond a reasonable doubt. But when 
he is satisfied that he has done so he is not required to waste the time and 
attention of the court by calling other witnesses whose testimony will be merely 
cumulative, or, from the very nature of the case, cannot add anything to the 
conclusiveness of the proof as to the existence or nonexistence of the fact he 
is seeking to prove. Cases may and do arise in which scores or hundreds of 
persons might be called upon to testify as to certain disputed facts, such as 
the location of a street, the distance between certain places, and the like. In 
such cases it is the duty of the fiscal to call to the witness stand only such 
witnesses as may be necessary to establish the disputed fact beyond a reasonable 
doubt. Having done so, the facts thus proven will not be put in doubt by the 
omission to call additional witnesses to the facts thus indisputably 
established. It is only in cases such as that of the United States <em>vs.</em> 
Tacubanza (<em>supra</em>), wherein the evidence actually offered is not, for 
some reason, wholly satisfactory, that the failure to call other disinterested 
and available witnesses is to be taken into consideration as weakening the case 
for the prosecution.</p>
<p>It will be observed that in the former case (U. S. <em>vs.</em> Tacubanza, 
<em>supra</em>), we were careful to say that the failure to call available 
disinterested witnesses is not necessarily "fatal." Where, as in that case, the 
evidence relied upon by the prosecution was "interested and prejudiced," and the 
very nature of the case is such that to avoid possibility of error, all 
available witnesses should be called in support of the facts relied upon by 
either party, the unexplained failure to call such witnesses naturally raises a 
question as to the motives of the party who is, responsible for the omission. 
But such questions do not necessarily arise where the facts are not seriously in 
dispute, or where they are conclusively established by unimpeachable testimony 
or by such a decisive preponderance of the evidence as to leave no reasonable 
ground for doubt in the mind of the court.</p>
<p>In the case at bar the evidence of record conclusively establishes the 
material facts upon which the judgment of conviction was pronounced by the court 
below.</p>
<p>This motion should therefore be, and is hereby, denied.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson, Moreland,</em> and <em>Araullo, 
JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
