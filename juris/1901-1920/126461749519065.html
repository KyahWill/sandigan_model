				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Juan  Bermudez and  his wife  Francisca fully identified the defendants at  the  trial as two of  the persons who entered their house on the night in question.  The defendants say in their brief that both of these witnesses testified, at  the preliminary  investigation,  that they did  not know who their assailants were.   This  statement, so far as the husband  is concerned,  is not borne out by the record. There is nothing therein to show that he did not, upon the question of  identity, testify  before the justice in the same way that he did in  the Court of  First Instance.   His wife explains her testimony before the justice by saying that she had never before been in a court and that she was so overawed  by the judicial presence that  she was not fully herself.</p>
<p>That the naming of these defendants was not an  afterthought, suggested  subsequent to the examination in the justice court, is  conclusively  shown by  the testimony of the sergeant of police who went to the house on December 26, two days  after the robbery,  for the purpose  of investigating it.   He says that the wife, Francisca, there told him that it was committed by the two defendants and others.  The same day  the sergeant  presented the complaint to the justice of the peace, charging these defendants and one Ricardo with the crime.  This was of course prior to any hearing before the justice.</p>
<p>The failure of the complaining witnesses to mention, on the first examination before the justice,  the taking of the money is not important.  They did testify to the  taking of a razor, a bolo, and two pocketknives.  The  taking  of the money did not add anything to the offense; it did not make  the crime different or its punishment greater.</p>
<p>The evidence in regard  to the alibi is not sufficient  to overcome the positive testimony of  identification by two witnesses who had known  the defendants for a long time.</p>
<p>The failure of the servant, Leon Sabal, to recognize the defendants is not  strange.  They remained in  the sala, and the two unknown men came into the kitchen,  where the servant was, bound him, blindfolded him, and left him there.   He had no opportunity at all to see the defendants.</p>
<p>The defense has made a motion in this court for  a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence.  Of the five affidavits presented,  four  of them relate to alleged attempts of Juan Bermudez to induce witnesses by bribery and threats to testify against the defendants.  The trial was concluded on  February 13,  and  the judgment was pronounced on February 14, yet one of these affidavits states  that on February 16 Bermudez summoned him  as a witness and promised him 100 pesos if he would testify against the defendants.</p>
<p>The  affidavit of  Juan Evangelista,  as to  the alibi  of the defendant Pedro, tends to weaken it rather than  to strengthen  it, by reason  of the contradiction between his statement and those of the  other witnesses for the defendants.   Moreover, no reason is given why his testimony could not have been procured for the  trial.</p>
<p>The  showing is not sufficient to justify us in granting a new  trial, and the motion is denied.</p>
<p>We hold that the crime committed was that of <em>bandolerismo</em> under Act No. 518.</p>
<p>The evidence is sufficient to support the judgment, and it is affirmed, Avith the costs of this instance against the appellants.</p>

<em>DISSENTING</em></div>
<p><strong>MCDONOUGH, J.,</strong> with whom concurs <strong>COOPER, J.:</strong></p>
<p>The information filed by the fiscal against the defendants is as followS:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The undersigned accuses Pedro Maano, Jacinto Maano, and  other persons unknown, of the crime of brigandage, committed as follows:</p>
  <p>"At midnight on the 23d of December last, together with other persons unknown, the accused, armed with Remington rifles and war bolos, assaulted the house  of Juan  Bermudez, situate in the barrio of Pandacaque, of the municipality of Tayabas,  taking from the owners of  the  said house, Juan Bermudez  and Francisco Abracia, whom they beat and intimidated,  the sum of f90.86  in  money,  and $4 in goods.   This within  the jurisdiction of this Court of First Instance of Tayabas, of the Seventh  Judicial  District of the Philippine Islands, and against the provisions of section 1 of Act No.  518."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon this charge the defendants  above  named  were placed upon trial, and  the prosecution proved that, about 10.30 o'clock on the night of December  23,  1902, several men called  to the occupants of the house to open it; that three voices were heard to call, and the call was repeated three times;  that the  inmates were afraid  and did not approach the window; that then they heard an order given by two persons to discharge the guns, which was done; that shortly after they heard another voice saying, "Aim," and then two shots were fired and the bullets went through the  walls of the house; that they saw the two defendants light a match for the purpose of setting fire to  the roof near the stairway; and that the wife of Juan Bermudez then opened the door to  them.  Four men entered, "the first two and  another being these defendants here present, armed with  rifles."   After entering, Pedro Maano again lit a match and wont toward the altar, where the lamp was, and lit it; then these two defendants asked for money, and the wife; gave them the money.  As soon as Maano got the $86, Mexican, he said, "Do you know us?"  To which the husband and wife replied, "No."   All this occurred after they were bound  and stretched out on the ground.  These two defendants struck the husband  with  the butt end of the gun, and  the defendant  Pedro Maano demanded the rest of the  money, and the reply was that there was no more,  whereupon  the two defendants struck the  husband and wife with the butt end  of the gun.   Those who had the guns were Pedro and Jacinto  Maano and one  Ricardo, Four men  with guns entered  the house, and about five remained outside, armed with long bolos.</p>
<p>In addition to the money there was taken other property consisting  of  bolos,  penknives, and bowie knives.  The husband and  wife were illtreated, the former requiring five days in which to recover from  the effects.</p>
<p>The foregoing  is substantially  all the testimony taken at  the  trial bearing  on  the crime committed  and its character.   No other testimonj' was received  relating to the charge of conspiracy under section 1 of Act No. 518.</p>
<p>Upon this state of  facts the court below found the defendants Pedro Maafio and Jacinto  Maano guilty of the crime of brigandage,  committed in violation of section  1 of Act No. 518, which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Section 1.  Whenever three or more persons, <em>conspiring together</em>, shall form a band of robbers for the purpose of stealing carabaos or other personal property, by means of force and violence, and shall  go out  upon  the highway or roam over  the country armed with  deadly weapons for this  purpose, they shall be  deemed  highway  robbers or brigands, and  every person engaged in the organization of the band, or joining it thereafter, shall, upon conviction thereof, be punished  by  death or imprisonment  for not less than twenty years, in the discretion of the court."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be noticed that  in  order to convict  under this section  it  is not  necessary to prove that  the defendants actually stole carabaos or other personal property or committed larceny or robbery; in fact,  section  2  of  the act expressly provides tliat it shall not be necessary to adduce evidence of robberv or theft.</p>
<p>All the proof that is required in order to establish the offense is (1)  that  three  or more  persons  conspired together; (2) that they formed a band of robbers; (3) that such band was formed for the purpose of stealing carabaos or other personal property by means of force and violence; (4) that they went out upon the highway or roamed over the country armed with deadly weapons for this purpose; and  (5t that the defendant or defendants engaged in the organization of the band or joined it after it was organized. And this  proof need not be direct; it  may  be indirect or circumstantial.  Nor did the majority of this  court  hold in the Decusin case (1  Off.  Gaz., 730),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> as is stated in the dissenting opinion, that the above-mentioned elements of the crime "must be proved by the evidence of witnesses who were present at the organization of the  band and who can testify as to its purposes; and that the proof of the actual  commission of the robbery is not sufficient."</p>
<p>On the contrary, it is stated in the majority opinion that "the evidence in proof of conspiracy will generally, from the nature of the case, be circumstantial;" and that, as stated  in  Greenleaf on Evidence, 92-95, and in Kelly <em>vs.</em> People (55 N. Y., 565), "if it be proved that the defendants pursued by their acts the same object, often by the same means, one performing one part and another another part, so as to complete it with a view to the same object,  the <em>conclusion </em>may be  <em>inferred </em>that they engaged  in a  conspiracy to effect that object"</p>
<p>The authorities cited to support this doctrine are worthy of consideration, and,  as no  authority has  been adduced to the contrary, we may safely follow them.</p>
<p>The  question to be determined in this case, and which was decided in the Decusin  case,  is not whether  the defendants  are guilty of robbery for the  evidence  shows them  to be guilty of that  crime beyond  a reasonable doubt,  but it is whether or not the evidence is sufficient to convict them of the crime of conspiracy under section 1 of Act  No. 518.</p>
<p>It is stated in the dissenting opinion in the Decusin case that Act No.  518 does not create a new crime.   We think it does.  That is not an act to punish the crime of robbery or larceny, for  upon proof of the acts of the defendants mentioned in the  law, they  may  be convicted, without proof, on the commission of robbery or larceny; and, if the conspirators or  brigands go further, and not only violate the terms of Act No. 518,  by  conspiring for the purposes mentioned, by forming their armed band, and by going out upon the highway or roaming over the country, acts which complete the  conspiracy and  the crime, but, in  addition to  this,  if  they  commit robbery or larceny,  they may be convicted in another trial, on the charge of robbery or larceny,  as the case may be. The offense committed under Act No. 518 is a felony, highly penal, and it does not merge in the felony of robbery or larceny committed by the same band; nor does  the robbery or larceny merge in the conspiracy.  Hence, Act No.  518 and the provisions of the Penal Code relating to robbery  and larceny are not in conflict,  and the former does  not expressly  or impliedly repeal or modify the latter, for they  do not relate  to the same crimes.</p>
<p>It has  been held that, where the defendant was acquitted of  larceny and  subsequently  indicted for obtaining the same goods under false pretenses, there was no merger and that the  defendant was lawfully convicted  of  the  latter crime.  (1 Bishop's Criminal Law, section 1053, subdiv. 4; 34 Texas, 667.)</p>
<p>Bishop also states, in the same section, that after acquittal for larceny  the defendant  may  be  convicted of obtaining the same chattels through  a  conspiracy  with third persons.</p>
<p>At common law,  where  a person  by the same act committed two crimes,  one a felony  and the other a misdemeanor, the latter merged  in the former, but if the crimes were both of the same degree, both felonies or both misdemeanors, there was no merger.   (Clark's Criminal  Law, 35; 1 Bishop's Criminal Law, sections 787, 788, 804,  etc.)</p>
<p>Under Act No. 518, the two offenses,  brigandage and robbery, all  felonies, can not  be committed by the same act, for the act or acts that complete the crime of brigandage precede, and  must  necessarily precede, the robbery; or, in other words, the  conspiracy is complete before the robbery  begins, and they are, therefore, separate and distinct offenses.   If three or more persons  were tried  and convicted under Act No. 518, and subsequently if the same persons were put upon trial for robbery, committed while members of the band, they could not set up a former conviction in  bar and plead  their constitutional right not to be put in jeopardy twice for the same offense, because the acts differ, the proofs differ, and the crimes differ.  (4 Bl. Com., 336; Commonwealth <em>vs.</em> Roby,  12 Pick., Mass., 496; People <em>vs.</em>  Majors, 65 Cal., 138.)</p>
<p>The very definition of  a  conspiracy makes this  point clear.  "It is a combination of two  or more persons, by some  concerted action, to accomplish  some criminal or unlawful purpose, or to accomplish some purpose not in itself  criminal  or  unlawful,  by criminal  or unlawful means."   (Pettibone <em>vs.</em> United States, 148 U.  S., 197.)</p>
<p>It is not necessary, therefore, that  the object for which the criminal purpose entered into should be accomplished in order to complete the crime; and this is especially true of the crime of conspiracy mentioned in Act No. 518, for the act itself says that it shall not be necessary to prove the robbery or theft.  It therefore follows that this  act does create a new crime;  and that it is not in conflict  with the provisions  of the Penal Code relating to robbery or larceny.   The proof in this case clearly shows robbery, under article 502 of the Penal  Code; and from this proof of robbery, and this proof alone, must Ave infer or conclude, in the language of the act, "beyond reasonable doubt that the accused wrere members of such an armed band?"</p>
<p>In the Decnsin case, on a similar state of facts, a majority of the court held  that such inference or conclusion was not warranted by the evidence in that  case; and that it was necessary  to prove  directly,  or by circumstantial evidence, something  more  than the bare fact of robbery committed by three or more armed men, in order to justify the conclusion that those  men conspired together and formed a band of robbers  for the purpose of stealing personal  property and went  out on the highway or roamed over the country  armed  with  deadly weapons for this purpose.</p>
<p>A brigand is defined in Webster's International Dictionary as a "lawless fellow who lives by plunder; one of a band of robbers,  especially one of a gang living in mountain retreats; a highwayman; a freebooter."   In the same book a robber is defined  as "one who feloniously  takes goods  or money from the person of another by violence, or by putting him in fear."</p>
<p>From these definitions, it may be reasonably  concluded that, while every brigand is a robber,  every robber is not a brigand, and so this  court held that the proof which was sufficient to  convict the accused of robbery was not sufficient to convict them of brigandage under Act No. 518.</p>
<p>It may be asked, how can the crime of conspiracy, mentioned in the act in question,  be proved  other than by showing robbery  by an armed band of three or  more persons?</p>
<p>Here is the answer of Judge Speer in the case of the United States <em>vs. </em> Lancaster (44  Fed. Rep., 896) :</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"What is the nature of  the proof  necessary to support a charge of conspiracy?  The first cardinal rule of existence is this: After evidence showing the existence of the conspiracy is  submitted  to the jury the acts of the conspirators may, in all cases, be given  in  evidence against each other,  if these acts were  done in pursuance of the common illegal object.  *  *  *</p>
  <p>"It  is not required that the  conspiracy or the act of conspiring be proved by direct testimony.   It  is indeed competent to  show the  conspiracy  by showing disconnected overt acts, where the proof also shows that the conspirators were thrown  together,  or acted through  a common medium,  and had a common interest in promoting the object of the conspiracy.</p>
  <p>"A common design is the essence of the charge of conspiracy,  and this is  made to  appear when the parties steadily pursue the same  object, when acting separately or together, by common or different means, all tending to the same unlawful result."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Judge Dyer, in the case of the United States <em>vs.</em> Goldberg  (25 Fed.  Cases, 1342), tried in the circuit court of Wisconsin, in discussing this question, said: "The understanding, combination, or agreement between  the parties, to effect the unlawful purpose  charged, must be proved, because without the corrupt agreement or understanding there is  no conspiracy, but circumstantial evidence may be resorted to to show the agreement or conspiracy.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The acts  of the parties, the nature of the acts, their declarations and statements, whether verbal or in writing, and the character of the transactions, with the  accompanying circumstances as the evidence may disclose them, should be  investigated and  considered as  sources from which evidence may be derived of the  existence or nonexistence of the agreement which may be expressed or implied to do the alleged unlawful act.</p>
  <p>"The burden of proof is  on the  Government to prove what  it affirms, by legal and competent evidence."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The evidence in the case at bar falls  far short of the proof pointed out by Judges Speer and Dyer.   It does not show the very essence of the crime charged, viz,  a  "common design," the "understanding, combination, or agreement," on the part of  those engaged in the robbery,  to form an armed band of robbers for the purpose of stealing carabaos or other personal property, and that for that purpose they went out on the highway or roamed over the country.  In other  words,  it does not show that they formed a band of brigands and went out as brigands, which is the crime charged; nor can such essence of the crime be  fairly inferred beyond a reasonable doubt, from the facts proved.</p>
<p>In the case of the United  States <em>vs.</em> Newton  (52 Fed. Rep., 275) it was laid down as law, in a case of conspiracy to defraud the United States, that the evidence must show (1) that the conspiracy charged existed; (2) that the overt act charged was committed;  and (3) that  the defendant was one of the conspirators.</p>
<p>In the  case before us the overt act alleged, the robbery, has been proved, and the fact that the defendants took part in  its execution, but we have no direct proof relative to the conspiracy.  It  is said, however, that we may  infer it from the fact that the accused took part in the overt act alleged, which, by the way, is not the overt act required to be shown by Act No. 518.</p>
<p>In  order to justify the  inference of legal  guilt  from circumstantial evidence, the existence  of  the inculpatory facts  must be absolutely incompatible with the innocence of  the accused and incapable of explanation upon any other reasonable hypothesis than that of guilt.   (Burrell on  Criminal  Evidence, sec. 737.)</p>
<p>The inculpatory facts in  the  case at bar are not incompatible with innocence of the crime of conspiracy, nor incapable  of  explanation  upon  any  other  reasonable hypothesis than that of being guilty of conspiracy; they may be explained on the  reasonable hypothesis that the defendants intended to commit the robbery in question—an  entirely different crime.</p>
<p>It was said in the case of Pogue <em>vs.</em> State (12 Tex. Ap., 283-294) that if the inculpatory facts and circumstances are capable of two or more explanations, one of which is consistent  with the innocence of the accused (of the crime charged, of course), and  the other consistent  with his guilt, then the evidence does not  fill  the test of moral certainty, and is insufficient to support the conviction.</p>
<p>In the celebrated Webster case (5 Cush., Mass., 312-313) Chief Justice Shaw, in discussing this subject, stated:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"In case of circumstantial evidence, where no witness can testify directly to the  fact to be proved, it is arrived at by a  series of other  facts, which by experience have been found so associated with the fact in question that in the relation of cause and effect  they lead  to  a satisfactory and  certain conclusion;  as  when footprints  are discovered  after  a recent  snow,  it  is  certain that some animated being has passed  over the snow since it fell, and, from the form and number of footprints, it can be determined with equal certainty whether they are  those of a man, a bird, or a quadruped.</p>
  <p>"Circumstantial evidence,  therefore,  is founded on experience  and observed facts  and coincidents establishing a connection between the known and proved  facts and the fact sought to be proved.</p>
  <p>"The advantages  are  that, as the evidence commonly comes from several witnesses and different  sources,  a chain of circumstances is less likely to be falsely prepared and arranged, and falsehood and perjury are more likely to be detected and fail of their purpose.  *   *  *</p>
  <p>"It is manifest  that <em>great care</em> and <em>caution</em> ought to be used in drawing inferences from proved facts.  *  *  * </p>
  <p>"The inference  to be  drawn from the facts must be a natural one, and to a <em>moral  certainty, a certain one</em>. It is not sufficient that it is probable only; it must be reasonably and morally certain."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reasonable and natural inference in this Maano case does not lead us to a moral certainty that the  defendants were not only guilty of  the robbery but were  also guilty of conspiracy for  the purposes mentioned in section 1 of Act No. 518.  Otherwise we should have to reach the conclusion, in every  case where the evidence showed robbery committed by three  or more  men armed with dangerous weapons and showed nothing further, that the perpetrators were brigands as  defined by law and that they  must be convicted of brigandage instead of robbery.</p>
<p>Suppose three  servants employed in a hotel ascertain that a guest has  in  his room a sum of money, and these servants arm themselves with bolos or revolvers, go to the room, intimidate  the guest, and take forcible possession of his money.  On such  a state of facts there could be no doubt  about characterizing this crime  as  robbery,  but could it be inferred,  beyond a reasonable doubt, that they would be guilty also of conspiring together to form an armed band of brigands for the purpose of stealing carabaos or other personal property and that they actually went out on the highway or roamed over the country for that purpose?</p>
<p>Such an inference would not be "a reasonable or natural one and  to  a moral  certainty a certain  one."  It would not be even  probable; it would be wholly illogical.</p>
<p>Many examples of  this  kind  might be suggested where it would not follow as a lawful conclusion, or deduction from the bare proof of robbery, that the criminal acts mentioned in  Act No. 51S wove committed.</p>
<p>Something more than the fact of robbery must be shown. Thus in the case of Newel <em>vs. </em>Jenkins (26 Penn. St. Kept., 159)  in an action against a prosecutor, a magistrate, and a constable for conspiring together to arrest and imprison a person without probable cause, it was held that evidence that  each one acted illegally or maliciously would not support the action without proof that the defendants combined and conspired together to do such  acts.</p>
<p>For similar reasons it  must be slrown  here that the defendants  conspired  together  to do, and  did do, the  acts made criminal under the act in question.</p>
<p>If  we are to jump  at  conclusions, if  we are to draw inferences and deductions not warranted by the  facts or the law,  why could we not just as well convict the defendants in this case of sedition as of conspiracy?</p>
<p>The facts show that nine men, four armed with rifles and five with bolos, and in a tumultuous manner, took part in tliis robbery, and despoiled Juan Bermudez  and Francisca  Abracia  of their property.</p>
<p>To  despoil is to take by violence,  or clandestine means, the property  of  another.  (Senol <em>vs.</em> Hepburn,  1  Cal., 268.)</p>
<p>Section 5 of Act No. 292  of the Philippine Commission provides that  all persons who rise publicly  and tumultuously, in order to attain by  force or outside legal methods any of the following objects, are guilty  of sedition;  and one of these objects  is  (subdiv. 5) "to despoil, with political or social  object,  any  class  of  persons, natural or artificial, a municipality,  a  province, or the  Insular  Government," etc.</p>
<p>It surely could not be reasonably inferred  that,  because the defendants here took  part in despoiling natural persons, therefore they violated this sedition  law.   It may be observed  at a glance that,  to convict under that  act, it would be necessary  not only to  prove a  violation of the terms of  section 5 of the  act but also the act of despoliation under subdivision 5 with a <em>political  or  social  object</em>. and surely this object or purpose could not be reasonably or  logically inferred  from the mere act  of despoliation. For like reasons we can not infer the existence of the crime of conspiracy or brigandage from the  naked fact of  robbery and without any proof whatever  of the intention of the defendants to organize and go out  in violation of Act No. 518.</p>
<p>We should not lose sight of the words of Justice Shaw, "that it is  manifest that great care and caution ought to be used in  drawing inferences from proved facts."</p>
<p>We know from the evidence before us that the defendants intended to commit robbery; we can not safely guess that they also intended to form such  a conspiracy as is defined by Act No. 518.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that this case may be distinguished from that of Decusin, because there the accused were armed with bolos, whereas here four were armed with  rifles.   In Act No. 518 the words "armed with  deadly weapons" are used.   This court has repeatedly passed upon cases in which the term of imprisonment depended upon  whether the accused were armed or not, and it has invariably been held that when the  offenders had bolos at the time of the commission of the  offense they were " armed," and  this holding seems reasonable and proper, because it is a matter of common knowledge in  these Islands that a  blow or a stab administered with a  bolo  may be as dangerous  and deadly as a wound made by a rifle ball.</p>
<p>A deadly weapon  is not  exclusively one designed to take life or inflict bodily  injury.  (Blige <em>vs.</em> State, 20 Fla., 742; 51 Am. Rept, 628.)</p>
It follows that the defendants are guilty of robbery,  and not of conspiracy or brigandage under Act No. 518.<br>
