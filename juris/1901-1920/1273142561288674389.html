				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Each of said plaintiffs and appellants arrived at the port of Manila on the 
8th day of May, 1917, on the steamship <em>Yuen Sang</em>, and asked permission 
to enter the Philippine Islands. They were each taken before a board of special 
inquiry and their right to enter was inquired into by said board. After a 
consideration of the status of each of them the board found that they were not 
entitled to enter the territory of the United States by virtue of the provisions 
of section 3 of the Act of Congress of February 5, 1917. From that decision they 
appealed to the Collector of Customs who affirmed the same. Later, a petition 
for a writ of habeas corpus was presented in the Court of First Instance of the 
city of Manila, accompanied by copy of the record of the Department of Customs. 
After a consideration of said petition, the Honorable George R. Harvey, judge, 
in a carefully prepared opinion, confirmed the conclusion of the Department of 
Customs, denied the petition for the writ of habeas corpus and remanded each of 
said appellants to the custody of the Collector of Customs in order that said 
appellants might be returned to the place whence they came, by the steamship 
company who brought them to the Philippine Islands. From that judgment each of 
the appellants appealed to this court.
<p>The case, by agreement, was submitted to this court upon the briefs presented 
in the court below. The question presented is whether or not the appellants have 
a right to enter the territory of the United States in view of the provisions of 
section 3 of the Act of Congress of February 5, 1917. From the record it 
appears:</p>
<p>(1) That Ram Singh, 22 years of age, is an East Indian, born in Punjab; that 
he has been a farmer and a peddler and has never been in the Philippine Islands 
before;</p>
<p>(2) That Dhan Singh, 27 years of age, is an East Indian, born in Punjab; that 
he has been a peddler and has never been in the Philippine Islands before;</p>
<p>(3) That Ghola Singh, 36 years of age, is an East Indian, born in Badhait; 
that he has been a farmer and night watchman and has never been in the 
Philippine Islands before;</p>
<p>(4) That Ghanda Singh, 36 years of age, is an East Indian, born in Ghaniwala; 
that he has been a night watchman and a farmer in India and has never been in 
the Philippine Islands before;</p>
<p>(5) That Jagjit Singh, 31 years of age, is an East Indian, bom in Punjab; 
that he has been a night watchman and farmer; that he comes to the Philippine 
Islands for the purpose of finding work as a night watchman or some other 
business; that there is no proof that he has ever been in the Philippine Islands 
before;</p>
<p>(6) That Pala Singh, 35 years of age, is an East Indian, born in Punjab; that 
he has been in the Philippine Islands for a period of five years commencing with 
1907; that while in the Philippine Islands he has been a peddler and night 
watchman; that he has been a peddler in India.</p>
<p>Section 3 of the Act of Congress of February 5, 1917, provides, among other 
things, thatâ€”</p>
<p>"Natives of any country, province, or dependency situate on the Continent of 
Asia west of the one hundred and tenth meridian of longitude east from Greenwich 
and east of the fiftieth meridian of longitude east from Greenwich and south of 
the fiftieth parallel of latitude north, except that portion of said territory 
situate between the fiftieth and the sixty-fourth meridians of longitude east 
from Greenwich and the twenty-fourth and thirty-eighth parallels of latitude 
north, and no alien now in any way excluded from, or prevented from entering, 
the United States shall be admitted to the United States."</p>
<p>Said section 3 further provides that the following class of persons, from the 
said territory above described in India, may be admitted under certain 
conditions:</p>
<p>"(<em>a</em>) Government officials.<br>"(<em>b</em>) Ministers or religious 
teachers.<br>"(<em>c</em>) Missionaries.<br>"(<em>d</em>) 
Lawyers.<br>"(<em>e</em>) Physicians.<br>"(<em>f</em>) 
Chemists.<br>"(<em>g</em>) Civil Engineers.<br>"(<em>h</em>) 
Teachers.<br>"(<em>i</em>) Students.<br>"(<em>j</em>) Authors.<br>"(<em>k</em>) 
Artists.<br>"(<em>l</em>) <em>Merchants</em>.<br>"(<em>m</em>) Travelers for 
curiosity or pleasure."</p>
<p>The lower court found that all and each of the above named persons came from 
the territory, the inhabitants of which were absolutely prohibited from entering 
the territory of the United States and <em>did not belong to any of the 
exceptions above</em> mentioned under the Act of Congress of February 5, 1917, 
and confirmed the decision of the Department of Customs.</p>
<p>The appellants contend:</p>
<p>(<em>a</em>) That by virtue of treaty relations between the United States and 
Great Britain, they are entitled to enter the territory of the United 
States;<br><br>(<em>b</em>) That they are merchants and therefore belong to the 
class of persons who may enter the territory of the United States under the 
above quoted Act of Congress; and</p>
<p>(<em>c</em>) That the board of special inquiry had no jurisdiction to reject 
their application to enter the Philippine Islands.</p>
<p>With reference to the contention of the appellants that they are entitled to 
enter the territory of the United States under treaty relations, it may be said; 
(1) That by reason of the existence of British sovereignty over the territory 
included in the above quoted provision of the Act of Congress, there can be no 
treaty relations between the United States and the people of that territory; 
that whatever treaty relations exist concerning the said territory must be 
between the Government of the United States and Great Britain; (2) that the 
treaty relations between the United States of America and His Britannic Majesty 
relating to the right of British subjects to enter the territory of the United 
States is expressly limited to His Majesty's subjects in Europe and does not 
apply to British subjects of India; and (3) that even though there existed a 
treaty between the two countries, the Act of Congress being of later date, its 
provisions would control.</p>
<p>Justice Field, in the case of Whitney <em>vs</em>. Robertson, (124 U. S., 
190), speaking for the Supreme Court of the United States said: "A treaty is 
primarily a contract between two or more independent nations, * * * For the 
infraction of its provisions a remedy must be sought by the injured party 
through reclamations upon the other. * * * If the treaty contains stipulations 
which are self-executing, that is, require no legislation to make them operate, 
to that extent they have the force and effect of a legislative enactment. 
Congress may modify such (treaty) provisions, so far as they bind the United 
States, or supersede them altogether. By the Constitution a Treaty is placed on 
the same footing, and made of like obligation, with an Act of legislation. Both 
are declared by that instrument to be the supreme law of the land, and no 
superior efficacy is given to either over the other, When the two relate to the 
same subject, the courts will always endeavor to construe them so as to give 
effect to both, if that can be done without violating the language of either; 
but if the two are inconsistent, the one last in date will control the other, 
provided always the stipulation of the treaty on the subject is self-executing. 
If the country with which the treaty is made is dissatisfied with the action of 
the legislative department, it may present its complaint to the executive head 
of the government, and take such other measures as it may deem essential for the 
protection of its interest. The courts can afford no redress." (Taylor 
<em>vs</em>. Morton, 2 Curtis, 454, 459; Head <em>vs</em>. Money Cases, 112 U. 
S., 580; Foster &amp; Elan <em>vs</em>. Neilson, 2 Peters [U. S.], 253, 314; The 
Cherokee Tobacco, 11 Wall. [U. S.], 616, 621; U. S. <em>vs</em>. Lee Yen Tai, 
185 U. S., 213, 220.)</p>
<p>As Congress may by statute abrogate, so far at least as the United States is 
concerned, a treaty previously made by the United States with another nation, so 
the United States may by treaty supersede a prior Act of Congress on the same 
subject.</p>
<p>In the case of Foster &amp; Elan vs. Neilson (<em>supra</em>) it was said 
that a treaty was to be regarded by the courts of justice as equivalent to an 
Act of the Legislature, whenever it operates of itself without the aid of any 
legislative provision.</p>
<p>In the case of Head <em>vs</em>. Money Cases (<em>supra</em>), the court 
said: "So far as a treaty made by the United States with any foreign nation can 
be the subject of judicial cognizance in the courts of this country, it is 
subject to such acts as Congress may pass for its enforcement, modification or 
repeal."</p>
<p>Said Act of Congress, in its section 3 above quoted, expressly provides that 
said section 3 should not operate in cases otherwise provided for by existing 
treaties, and no treaty having been called to our attention affecting the right 
of the appellants to enter the territory of the United States, it is the duty of 
the courts to construe and give effect to the express provision of the Act of 
Congress. (Whitney <em>vs</em>. Robertson, 124 U. S., 190, 195.)</p>
<p>With reference to the second contention of the appellants that they are 
merchants and are therefore entitled to enter the territory of the United 
States, it may be said: (1) That the Act of Congress furnishes us no definition 
for a merchant. We must therefore accept the general definition. The appellants 
admitted that they were night watchmen and peddlers. A peddler is generally 
defined to be a person who travels about the country with merchandise for the 
purpose of selling it; he is an itinerant trader who carries goods about in 
order to sell them, in contra-distinction to a trader who has goods for sale and 
sells them at a fixed place of business. He is an itinerant individual, 
ordinarily without local habitation or place of business, who travels about the 
country carrying commodities for sale. (Graffty <em>vs</em>. Rushville, 117 
Ind., 502; Davenport <em>vs</em>. Rice, 75 Iowa, 74; Commonwealth <em>vs</em>. 
Farnum, 114 Mass., 267, 270; Emert <em>vs</em>. State of Missouri, 156 U. S., 
296; Roy <em>vs</em>. Schuff, 51 La. Ann., 86; Graffina <em>vs</em>. Finnegan, 
52 La. Ann., 694.) While a merchant is a person engaged in buying and selling 
merchandise at a fixed place of business. (Tom Hong <em>vs</em>. U. S., 193 U. 
S., 517.)</p>
<p>The appellants are not merchants and do not therefore belong to the exempted 
class mentioned above in said section 3 of the Act of Congress.</p>
<p>With reference to the contention of appellants that the board of special 
inquiry had no authority or jurisdiction to reject their application to enter 
the Philippine Islands, it may be said that said Act of Congress in section 1 
provides, that it shall be enforced in the Philippine Islands by officers of the 
Government thereof. By that, provision, Congress evidently intended that the 
Government of the Philippine Islands should enforce said Act by the machinery 
and with the officers which it had created for the purpose of enforcing the 
Alien Exclusion Laws. The right and authority of the board of special inquiry to 
act as it did in the present case has been judicially determined in many cases 
contrary to the contentions which the appellants here make. (Chieng Ah Sui 
<em>vs</em>. McCoy, 239 U. S., 139; 22 Phil. Rep., 361; 36 Sup. Ct. Rep., 95; 
<em>In re</em> Allen, 2 Phil. Rep., 630; Tan Chin Hin <em>vs</em>. Collector of 
Customs, 27 Phil. Rep., 521.)</p>
<p>We are of the opinion, and so decide, that in view of the provisions of the 
Act of Congress "that said Act shall be enforced in the Philippine Islands by 
the government thereof," that the Collector of Customs and the officers 
appointed in the Department of Customs, in the absence of other officers 
appointed for that purpose by the Secretary of the Treasury of the United 
States, had authority to enforce those provisions of the Act of Congress of 
February 5, 1917, which restricted the immigration of aliens into the Philippine 
Islands.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, we are of the opinion and so decide that the 
appellants are not entitled, by virtue of the provisions of section 3 of the Act 
of Congress of February 5, 1917, to enter the Philippine Islands.</p>
<p>Therefore, the judgment of the lower court is hereby affirmed, and it is 
hereby ordered and decreed that each of the appellants must be remanded to the 
custody of the Insular Collector of Customs in order that they may be returned 
to the place whence they came, in accordance with the orders heretofore dictated 
by the Department of Customs.</p>
<p>It is so ordered, with costs against the appellants.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Street, Malcolm, AvanceÃ±a</em>, and <em>Fisher, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p></div>
