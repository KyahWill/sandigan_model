				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In the month of November, 1911, in the barrio of Hinlayagan, municipality of 
Talibon, Bohol Province, the seven defendants and appellants first above named 
killed a neighbor named Sixto Lota, together with his wife and three small 
children.
<p>It appears that these men believed or suspected that Lota was a "bad man," a 
kind of a wizard, who kept in tys possession a "barang," a mysterious and deadly 
insect which can ba taught to seek out and kill or injure any one who has the 
ill-will of the owner. The leading spirit in the commission of the crime was 
Pantaleon Abanzado, who gave some of the others small sums of money, ranging 
from to P9 for their assistance, and although not present himself when the 
killing took place, worked out the plan in all its details which was followed by 
the others, acting under and in strict compliance with his instructions. The 
party assembled at his house where they were supplied with ropes. From there 
they went to the house of their victims, secured admission on the pretense that 
they had come to buy tobacco, seized and tied the man and his wife and their 
three children, the eldest of whom was not more than six or seven years of age, 
and dragged them by the ropes, tied about their necks, to a stream called 
Cambinoy, where they were hastily buried in accordance with the directions of 
Pantaleon Abanzado. On the way to the burial place the party came to a stream 
called Canlagbason, and finding that by that time every member of the family 
except one child was dead, one of the party held the still living child under 
the water until it was drowned.</p>
<p>The commission of this frightful crime remained unknown to the authorities 
until the( provincial governor, the Honorable Eutiquio Boyles, instituted an 
inquiry, a few years afterwards into the unexplained disappearance of Lota and 
his family, which resulted in a number of admissions and confession by different 
members of the party, corroborated by the discovery of the skeletons of Lota and 
his wife at the place where it appeared from these admissions and confessions 
they had been buried.</p>
<p>Two members of the party turned state's evidence and, on the witness stand, 
gave full, detailed accounts of all that occurred, which are so clear and 
convincing, that they leave no room for doubt as to the guilt of the men 
convicted as principals in the court below, when examined and reviewed together 
with the corroborated evidence, touching the disappearance of Lota and his 
family, the discovery of the skeletons at the place where they had been buried, 
and the admissions and confessions of the accused in the course of the extra 
judicial investigation made by Governor Boyles.</p>
<p>Counsel for the accused makes no serious attempt at this time to question the 
truth and accuracy of the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution, but 
contends that the testimony of the accomplices and the evidence as to 
extrajudicial admissions and confessions of some of the accused should not have 
been admitted in the court below, and that without this evidence there is no 
evidence in the record which sustains the judgment of conviction.</p>
<p>Counsel for the appellants asserts that it does not appear from the record 
that the alleged extrajudicial admissions and confessions were made freely and 
voluntarily. But it affirmatively appears from the testimony of Governor Boyles, 
cited in the Attorney-General's brief, that these admissions and confessions 
were made voluntarily, and were secured without the use of undue influence; and 
there is no evidence whatever in the record which even tends to put in doubt the 
truth of his statements or to raise any question as to his credibility as a 
witness for the prosecution. The accused themselves made no claim of this kind 
in the court below, and we agree with the Attorney-General that there is nothing 
in the record which sustains the contentions of counsel for the appellants in 
this regard.</p>
<p>The ground on which counsel alleges error in the admission of the testimony 
of the accomplices is the fact that the trial judge did not have in mind the 
provisions of Act No. 2709 when he discharged two of the defendants in order 
that they might be used as witnesses for the prosecution. It appears that this 
statute was enacted and became effective not long before the date of the trial 
in the court below; that no copy of the statute came to the hands of the trial 
judge until after the trial; that in the course of the proceedings he was 
informed by counsel, a member of the Legislature, that legislation relating to 
the discharge of accused persons to be used as Government witnesses had recently 
been enacted; but that not having any information as to the precise nature of 
this legislation, he discharged two of the defendants to be used as witnesses 
for the prosecution, in the exercise of the discretion conferred upon him under 
the provisions of section 34 of General Orders No. 58.</p>
<p>Counsel now insists that his action in this regard was illegal, and that the 
use of these persons as witnesses was not authorized by law, and constituted 
reversible error. We cannot agree with this contention.</p>
<p>The provisions of Act No. 2709 are set forth in four short sections as 
follows:</p>
<p>"SECTION 1. Every prosecution for a crime shall be in the name of the United 
States against all persons who appear to be responsible therefor, except in the 
cases determined in section two of this Act.</p>
<p>"SEC. 2. When two or more persons are charged with the commission of a 
certain crime, the competent court, at any time before they have entered upon 
their defense, may direct any of them to be discharged, that he may be a witness 
for the Government when in the judgment of the court:</p>
<p>"(<em>a</em>) There is absolute necessity for the testimony of the accused 
whose discharge is requested;</p>
<p>"(<em>b</em>) There is no other direct evidence available for the proper 
prosecution of the crime committed, except the testimony of said accused;</p>
<p>"(<em>c</em>) The testimony of said accused can be substantially corroborated 
in its material points;</p>
<p>"(<em>d</em>) Said accused does not appear to be the most guilty, and</p>
<p>"(<em>e</em>) Said accused has not at any time been convicted of the crime of 
perjury or false testimony or of any other crime involving moral turpitude.</p>
<p>"SEC. 3. All Acts or parts of Acts inconsistent with the provisions of this 
Act are hereby repealed.</p>
<p>"Sec. 4. This Act shall take effect on its approval."</p>
<p>The law in force on this subject prior to the enactment of Act No. 2709 is 
found in sections 34 and 36 of General Orders No. 58, which are as follows:</p>
<p>"Sec. 34. When two or more persons shall be included in the same charge, the 
court, at any time before the defendants have entered upon their defense or upon 
the application of the counsel of the Government, may direct any defendant to be 
discharged, that he may be a witness for the United States."</p>
<p>"Sec. 36. The order indicated in sections thirty-four and thirty-five shall 
amount to an acquittal of the defendant discharged, and shall be a bar to future 
prosecution for the same offense."</p>
<p>Examining the terms of these statutory enactments, it is clear that it was 
not the intention of the legislator, by the enactment of Act No. 2709, to 
deprive the prosecution and the state of the right to make use of accomplices 
and informers as witnesses, but merely to regulate the exercise of that right by 
establishing the conditions under which it may properly be exercised. It is 
clear, furthermore, that the legislator intended to rest the manner of the 
enforcement of these conditions in the sound judicial discretion of the courts. 
This discretion, in the very nature of the thing must, as a general rule, be 
exercised prior to the trial, and in all cases before the accused have entered 
upon their defense. Under the circumstances, it may well be expected that the 
court will err at times in its exercise. A trial judge cannot be expected or 
required to inform himself with absolute certainty at the very outset of the 
trial as to everything which may be developed in the course of the trial in 
regard to the guilty participation of the accused in the commission of the crime 
charged in the complaint. If that were practicable or possible there would be 
little need for the formality of a trial. He must rely in large part upon the 
suggestions and the information furnished by the prosecuting officer in coming 
to his conclusions as to the "necessity for the testimony of the accused whose 
discharge is requested;" as to the availability or nonavailability of other 
direct or corroborative evidence; as to which of the accused is "most guilty," 
and the like. If he errs in the exercise of his discretion and discharges a 
guilty person who should not have been set at liberty, the error, as a general 
rule, cannot be cured any more than any other error can be cured which results 
in an acquittal of a guilty defendant in a criminal action (U. S. <em>vs</em>. 
De Guzman, 30 Phil. Rep., 416); but no sound reason has been suggested in 
support of a ruling that the commission of such an error of discretion should 
have the effect of discharging from criminal liability the accused persons who 
were not discharged that they might be used as witnesses; and there is nothing 
in the law which indicates that it was the intention of the legislator to 
provide for their discharge under such circumstances.</p>
<p>Section 1 of the statute prescribes that every prosecution for a crime shall 
be against all persons who appear to be responsible therefor, except in the 
cases determined in section 2 of the Act. But this does not require the 
prosecuting officer to do the impossible, and to include the names of unknown 
participants in an information filed by him. Nor does it relieve him of the 
duty, when he institutes criminal proceedings on an "information" in the absence 
of a commitment by a magistrate, not to force to trial any person whose guilt he 
has no sufficient reason to believe he will be able to establish by the 
production of competent evidence. (U. S. <em>vs</em>. Barredo, 32 Phil. Rep., 
444.) It is very clear, then, that the statute does not relieve the prosecuting 
officer of the duty to exercise his sound discretion in determining what persons 
"appear" to be responsible for the commission of crimes in quch cases, though it 
imposes upon him the duty to include the names of all persons in his 
"information" who "appear" to have been guilty participants in the crime charged 
therein, either as a result of the exercise of his discretion upon the facts of 
which he is apprised, or because they have been held for trial by order of a 
committing magistrate. (U. S. <em>vs</em>. Barredo, <em>supra</em>.) But no one 
would contend that if for lack of knowledge of the facts, by mistake, or for any 
other reason, the prosecuting officer fails to include the names of one or more 
persons in an information filed by him, who were in fact guilty participants in 
the commission of the crime charged therein, such persons will be relieved of 
criminal liability; or that those accused who have been charged with the 
offense, brought to trial, and found guilty will be permitted to escape 
punishment merely because it develops in the course of the trial, or after the 
trial, that there were other guilty participants in the crime. This would be to 
enlarge rather than to restrict the power of the fiscal, contrary to the 
manifest spirit and intention of the act.</p>
<p>In like manner, the discharge of a defendant in a criminal action by the 
court, though it has the effect, as a general rule, of relieving the person thus 
discharge of criminal liability, in no wise affects the status of his 
codefendants—and this whether the court has acted wisely or unwisely, correctly 
or erroneously, with regard to the discharged defendant. It is the duty of the 
trial judge to exercise a sound discretion in conformity with the provisions of 
the statute. But if he fails in the performance of his duty, or errs in the 
exercise of his discretion in this regard, such error does not relieve from 
criminal responsibility the guilty participants who are not discharged to be 
used as witnesses, any more than a like error in weighing the evidence submitted 
at the trial which results in the acquittal of one of several coaccused, who was 
in truth and in fact a guilty participant in the crime charged against them, 
will afford a ground for a claim of exemption from criminal liability by the 
other accused who were properly convicted.</p>
<p>However much it is to be regretted that the use of <em>participes 
criminis</em> as witnesses under the provisions of this Act results in setting 
some guilty persons at liberty, and in some instances, at least, makes the state 
a party to the setting of a premium upon treachery and to the grant of a reward 
for conduct from which every honorable man instinctively recoils with horror and 
disgust; nevertheless, the practical experience of the ages seems to have 
demonstrated the necessity for the retention of the practice, under proper 
restrictions and regulations, in any system of~criminal procedure which sacredly 
conserves the rights of all accused persons not to be required to give evidence 
against themselves. Thus we find the practice recognized in. the English and the 
Federal courts, and incorporated into the various systems of criminal procedure 
in use in the different States of the Union. (Cf. discussion of the doctrine in 
U. S. <em>vs</em>. Barredo, <em>supra</em>.) The admission of the testimony of 
accomplices in our courts would seem to be the price, or a part of the price 
that must be paid, in order to escape the supposedly greater evils incident to 
what is sometimes called the <em>inquisitorial</em> system of criminal 
procedure. And however this may be, it is very certain that under the English 
and American systems, numberless crimes would go unpunished, and insolent and 
contumacious criminals would ofttimes defy the law with impunity, if the rules 
of criminal procedure were so construed or applied as to seal hermetically the 
mouths of accomplices, informers and <em>participes criminis</em> in general. 
(U. S. <em>vs</em>. De Guzman, 30 Phil. Rep., 416.)</p>
<p>In enacting the statute now under consideration, the Philippine Legislature 
clearly recognized the need for the use of the testimony of accomplices in 
certain cases, and. undertook merely to establish conditions under which the 
court, and not the prosecuting officer, may authorize the practice in a 
particular case.</p>
<p>An examination of the minutes of the proceedings in the Philippine Senate 
when the statute was under consideration, discloses that these conditions were 
expressly borrowed from the language of some of the courts in the United States, 
in setting forth the conditions under which the courts, in the absence of such a 
statute, should exercise their discretion in authorizing the use of accomplices 
as witnesses. (Speech of Senator Sison, Chairman of the Judicial Committee, 
citing Ray <em>vs</em>. State, 48 Am. Dec, 379—supreme court of Iowa.) And 
speaking generally, it would seem that these statutory provisions are merely an 
express declaration of the conditions which the courts were bound to have in 
mind in the exercise of a sound discretion under the terms of sections 34 and 36 
of General Orders No. 58.</p>
<p>We find no real or substantial conflict, then, between the provisions of 
section 2 of Act No. 2709 and the provisions of General Orders No. 58 on the 
same subject.</p>
<p>Both recognize the judicial discretion of the courts in the premises; and the 
express conditions set forth in the later statute are in substance and effect 
identical with those implied in the grant of discretion in the earlier law, for 
the provisions of General Orders No. 58 should not be presumed to have amounted 
to a grant of an arbitrary discretion to the trial courts, but rather a sound 
judicial discretion, to be exercised with due regard to the correct 
administration of justice.</p>
<p>In the case at bar, the trial judge, although not consciously controlled by 
the provisions of the later statute in the exercise of the discretion with which 
he was clothed, did in fact exercise his discretion in conformity with the 
express and implied conditions contained in both statutes— and as we have 
already indicated, an error in the exercise of that discretion, even if it 
appeared that there was such error, would not justify or necessitate the 
reversal of the judgment of conviction of the defendants not included in his 
order of dismissal.</p>
<p>There is nothing in the statute which prescribes that after one of several 
accused persons have been discharged by the trial judge in the exercise of the 
discretion conferred upon him by law, such discharged person may not be used as 
a witness against his coaccused, even if it should develop that the trial judge 
had erred in the exercise of his discretion through inadvertence, or for any 
other reason. And certainly the testimony of one of several accused persons, who 
is discharged by the trial judge in the exercise of the discretion with which he 
is clothed by law, in strict accord with the provisions of section 2 of Act No. 
2709, should not be ,held incompetent merely because the trial judge did not 
have those provisions consciously in mind when he entered the order of 
discharge.</p>
<p>The statute prescribes merely the conditions which should control the court 
in the exercise of its discretion in discharging accused persons in order that 
they may be used as witnesses against their coaccused; and we must look 
elsewhere to find the rules touching the competency, admissibility, relevancy 
and probative value of the testimony of these witnesses when it is offered in 
evidence, after they have been discharged by the court in order that they might 
be called as witnesses for the prosecution.</p>
<p>We conclude that it was not error in the court below to admit the testimony 
of the accomplices who were discharged in order that they might be called as 
witnesses for the prosecution, and that the judgment of conviction of each and 
all of the appellants except Juan Abanzado must be sustained.</p>
<p>The trial court convicted Juan Abanzado not as a principal, but as an 
accessory after the fact, it appearing that some time after the crime was 
committed, he accompanied some of the other accused to the place where the 
bodies were concealed on the night of the murder, and helped them to remove and 
bury these bodies at another and more remote spot. It affirmatively appears, 
however, that Juan Abanzado is a brother of Pantaleon and Aniano Abanzado, an 
uncle of Macario Abanzado and a cousin of Lota's wife, and should therefore have 
been exempted from criminal responsibility as an accessory after the fact, under 
the express provisions of article 16 of the Penal Code.</p>
<p>The only question which remains for consideration is the penalty which should 
have been imposed on the convicts. Manifestly, sentence of death was properly 
and lawfully imposed by the trial judge upon each and all of them, unless it be 
held that they should be given the benefit of the provisions of article 11 of 
the Penal Code, as amended, so as to reduce the penalty from death to life 
imprisonment.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that Pantaleon Abanzado, the leading spirit in the 
commission of this dastardly crime, appears to have been an extremely ignorant 
and superstitious man, we would have no little hesitation in applying the 
provisions of the article in his case were it now before us. The record 
discloses, however, that he died in prison pending this appeal, and the 
information has, therefore, been dismissed as to him.</p>
<p>As to the others, with some hesitation, but giving them the benefit of every 
reasonable doubt, we apply the provisions of the article so as to reduce the 
penalty to life-imprisonment. It is true that Pantaleon Abanzado gave some of 
them small sums of money to induce them to join with the others in the murder, 
but the record discloses that the real motive actuating these lamentably 
ignorant and superstitious men was the firm belief that their victims were 
members of a family whose head was a wizard, clothed with occult powers which 
made him and all the members of his family a menace to the safety and welfare of 
the remote community in which they lived. Most of the murderers were related by 
ties of blood or marriage to their victims, and it is clear from the record that 
in committing this abominable crime, they acted under the influence of some 
ancient tribal belief in witch-craft or some local but deep-rooted superstition 
handed down to them by their ignorant and uncivilized forebears, which led them 
to believe that in no other way could they secure the lives and safety of their 
families, their neighbors and themselves from threatened and unknown dangers. 
(Cf. U. S. <em>vs</em>. Pado and Garfin, 19 Phil. Rep., 111; U. S. <em>vs</em>. 
Maqui, 27 Phil. Rep., 97; U. S. <em>vs</em>. Flores, 28 Phil. Rep., 29.)</p>
<p>Article 11 of the Penal Code as amended by Act No. 2142 is as follows:</p>
<p>"The degree of instruction and education of the offender shall be taken into 
consideration by the courts for the purpose of mitigating or aggravating the 
penalties, according to the nature of the offense and the circumstances 
attending its commission."</p>
<p>We conclude that the judgment convicting and sentencing the defendants 
Faustino Puracan, Aniano Abanzado, Macario Abanzado, Carmelo Mejoy, Eutiquio 
Puracan and Santiago Baay should be modified by substituting the penalty of life 
imprisonment together with the accessory penalties prescribed by law, for so 
much as imposes the death penalty, and that thus modified the judgment in so far 
as they are affected thereby should be affirmed, with his proportionate share of 
the costs in this instance against each of them; and that the judgment 
convicting and sentencing Juan Abanzado as an accessory after the fact should be 
reversed, and this accused acquitted of the crime of which he is charged and set 
at liberty forthwith, with his proportionate share of the costs in both 
instances <em>de officio</em>. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson, Araullo</em>, and <em>Street, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p>
<p><em>Avanceña</em>, and <em>Fisher, JJ.</em>, did not take part.</p>

<p align="center"><em><strong>CONCURRING OPINION</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>MALCOLM, J.</strong>, <em>concurring:</em></p>
<p>I concur in the result. I reserve my opinion relative to an interpretation of 
Act No. 2709. My reasons are these: The law never sanctions impossibilities. The 
trial court sitting in the Province of Bohol, on March 9, 1917, when the 
question arose, had no authentic information of the substance of Act No. 2709, 
effective on March 11, 1917. The court was therefore under the duty of following 
the law of which it had knowledge, the pertinent parts of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure. Having complied with the provisions of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure, the court committed no error, and any discussion of Act No. 2709 is 
now unnecessary.</p></div>
