				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. SEVERINO VALDES Y GUILGAN, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This cause was instituted by a complaint filed by the prosecuting attorney 
before the Court of First Instance of this city, charging Severino Valdes y 
Guilgan and Hugo Labarro y Bunaladi, <em>alias</em> Hugo Navarro y Bunadia, with 
the crime of arson, and, on the 20th of May of the present year, judgment was 
rendered whereby Severino or Faustino Valdes y Guilgan was sentenced to six 
years and one day of <em>presidio mayor</em> and to pay one-half of the costs. 
From this judgment this defendant appealed. With respect to Hugo Labarro or 
Navarro, the proceedings were dismissed. with the other half of the costs <em>de 
officio</em>.
<p>Between 8 and 9 o'clock in the morning of April 28th of this year, when M. D. 
Lewin was absent from the house in which he was living with his family, at No. 
328, San Rafael Street, San Miguel, Mrs. Auckback, who appears to have been a 
resident of the neighborhood, called Mrs. Lewin and told her that much smoke was 
issuing from the lower fioor of the latter's house, for until then Mrs. Lewin 
had not noticed it, and as soon as her attention was brought to the fact she 
ordered the servant Paulino Banal to look for the fire, as he did, and he found, 
soaked with kerosene oil and placed between a post of the house and a partition 
of the entresol, a piece of a jute sack and a rag which were burning. At that 
moment the defendant Valdes was in the entresol, engaged in his work of 
cleaning, whiletthe other defendant Hugo Labarro was cleaning the horses kept at 
the place.</p>
<p>On the same morning of the occurrence, the police arrested the defendants, 
having been called for the purpose by telephone. Severino Valdes, after his 
arrest, according to the statement, Exhibit C, drawn up in-the police station, 
admitted before several policemen that it was he who had set the fire to the 
sack and the rag, which had been noticed on the date mentioned, and he also who 
had started the several other fires which had occurred in said house on previous 
days; that he had performed such acts through the inducement of the other 
prisoner, Hugo Labarro, for they felt resentment against, or had had trouble 
with, their masters, and that, as he and his coaccused were friends, he had 
acted as he did under the promise on Labarro's part to give him a peso for each 
such fire that he should start.</p>
<p>The defendant Severino Valdes admitted, in an affidavit, that he made 
declarations in the police station, although he denied having placed the rag and 
piece of jute sack, soaked with kerosene, in the place where they were found, 
and stated that it was the servant Paulino who had done so. He alleged that, on 
being arraigned, he stated that he had set fire to a pile of dry mango leaves 
that he had gathered together, which is contrary to the statement he made in the 
police station, to wit, that he had set the fire to the said rag and piece of 
sack under the house.</p>
<p>For lack of evidence and on his counsel's petition, the case was dismissed 
with respect to the other defendant Hugo Labarro.</p>
<p>Owing to the repeated attempts, made for about a month past, since Severino 
Valdes began to serve the Lewin family, to burn the house above mentioned, 
occupied by the latter and in which this defendant was employed, some policemen 
were watching the building and one of them, Antonio Garcia del Cid, one morning 
prior to the commission of the crime, according to his testimony, saw the 
defendant Valdes climbing up the wall of the warehouse behind the dwelling 
house, in which warehouse there was some straw that had previously been burned, 
and that, when the defendant noticed the presence of the policeman, he desisted 
from climbing the wall and entering the warehouse.</p>
<p>The fact of setting fire to a jute sack and a rag, soaked with kerosene oil 
and placed beside an upright of the house and a partition of the entresol of the 
building, thus endangering the burning of the latter, constitutes the crime of 
frustrated arson of an inhabited house, on an occasion when some of its inmates 
were inside of it. This crime is provided for and punished by article 549, in 
connection with articles 3, paragraph 2, and 65 of the Penal Code, and the sole 
proven perpetrator of the same by direct participation is the defendant Severino 
Valdes, for, notwithstanding his denial and unsubstantiated exculpations, the 
record discloses conclusive proof that it was he who committed the said unlawful 
act, as it was also he who was guilty of having set the other fires that 
occurred in said house. In an affidavit the defendant admitted having made 
declarations in the police station, and though at the trial, he denied that he 
set fire to the sacks and the rag which were found soaked in kerosene and 
burning, and, without proof whatever, laid the blame unto his codefendant, the 
fact is that he confessed to having set fire to a pile of dry leaves whereby 
much smoke arose from the lower part of the house, but which, however, did not 
forewarn his mistress, Mrs. Lewin, though she should have noticed it, and he 
allowed the sack and the rag to continue burning until Mrs. Auckback, noticing a 
large volume of smoke in the house, gave the alarm. No proof was submitted to 
substantiate the accusation he made against the servant Paulino, who apparently 
is the same person as the driver Hugo Labarro.</p>
<p>The crime is classified only as frustrated arson, inasmuch as the defendant 
performed all the acts conducive to the burning of said house, but nevertheless, 
owing to causes independent of his will, the criminal act which he intended was 
not produced. The offense committed cannot be classified as consummated arson by 
the burning of said inhabited house, for the reason that no part of the building 
had yet commenced to burn, although, as the piece of sack and the rag, soaked in 
kerosene oil, had been placed near the partition of the entresol, the partition 
might have started to burn, had the fire not been put out on time.</p>
<p>There is no extenuating or aggravating circumstance to be considered in 
connection with the commission of the crime, and therefore the penalty of 
<span style="font-style: italic;">presidio mayor</span> immediately inferior in degree to that specified in article 549 
of the Penal Code, should be imposed in its medium degree.</p>
<p>For the foregoing reasons the judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with 
the modification, however, that the penalty imposed upon the defendant shall be 
eight years and one day of <span style="font-style: italic;">presidio mayor</span>, with the accessory penalties 
prescribed in article 57 of the Code. The defendant shall also pay the costs of 
both instances. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Johnson, Araullo, Street, Malcolm</em>, and 
<em>Avanceña, JJ.</em>, concur.</p></div>
