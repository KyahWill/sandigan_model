				G.R. No. 12354, March 17, 1917</h4>
				<H3>GREGORIO REMATA, PETITIONER, VS. JUAN JAVIER, RESPONDENT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>TRENT, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div algin="justify">This is an action of quo warranto instituted by Gregorio Remata against Juan 
Javier for the purpose of ousting the latter from the office of municipal 
president of Candelaria, Province of Tayabas, and placing the plaintiff in 
possession of the same.
<p>The grounds upon which the action is based, according to the complaint, are 
that Juan Javier was duly elected president, qualified and assumed the office in 
1912, and that his term expired by operation of law on October 15, 1916. As a 
result of the general election held on June 6, 1916, Juan Javier was declared 
reflected by the municipal board of canvassers. Subsequent thereto, Ricardo 
Nadres, one of the candidates, contested Javier's election. After due hearing, 
the Court of First Instance found and decreed that no one was legally elected 
president and so certified to the proper authorities. At the same general 
election of 1916, Gregorio Remata, the plaintiff, was elected vice-president and 
entered upon the duties of his office on October 16, 1916. </p>
<p>The defendant demurred to the complaint upon the ground that it does not 
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action because the failure to 
elect a municipal president of Candelaria, did not create a vacancy which the 
vice-president has a right to fill.</p>
<p>In the consideration of this question, it must be borne in mind that this is 
not a case of a contest between parties as to the result of an election for an 
office for which they were opposing candidates before the people. When an 
election takes place and the will of the voters is expressed through the ballot 
box, the candidate receiving the number of votes necessary to elect him, is 
entitled to the possession of the office, its rights and emoluments. These are 
his property; his right to them is a private right which the law protects and 
the courts will enforce. A person who is entitled to fill a vacancy has the same 
rights and remedies.</p>
<p>Section 2123 of Act No. 2657, effective July 1, 1916, provides that the term 
of a municipal officer shall begin on the sixteenth day of October following the 
election and shall end on the fifteenth of the same month four years thereafter. 
The section further provides that if a successor be not inducted at the time 
appointed by law, the incumbent shall hold over until a successor shall be duly 
qualified.</p>
<p>Section 2126 of the same Code reads, in part, as follows:</p>
<p>"<em>Vacancies in municipal office</em>.—Vacancies occurring in elective 
municipal offices shall be filled as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(<em>a</em>) In case of the president, by the vice-president, or if there be 
no vice-president, by the council or who at the last general election received 
the highest number of votes.</p>
<p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>"(<em>d</em>) In any case for which special provision is not made, by a 
qualified elector of the municipality to be thereunto designated by the 
provincial governor, with the approval of the provincial board, after 
recommendation by the municipal council.</p>
<p>"A person thus called to fill a vacancy shall hold for the unexpired term and 
until the qualification of a successor."</p></blockquote>
<p>If our inquiry as to the meaning of the words "vacancy" and "vacancies" is to 
be limited to section 2126, we would have to hold that the defendant's 
contention to the effect that no vacancy occurred, is well founded and supported 
by the weight of authority in the United States. But, if the Legislature 
intended that the word "vacancy" should be given a double meaning so as to 
include the instant case, then the result will be different. That the 
Legislature so intended, clearly appears from other provisions of the 
Administrative Code. </p>
<p>Section 2000 of the Administrative Code provides in the first paragraph, that 
when a vacancy occurs in an elective provincial office by reason of the death, 
resignation or removal of the incumbent, the Governor-General shall appoint a 
suitable person thereto. In paragraph two, provisions are made for the calling 
of a special election in case the general election fails to take place or the 
election fails. Under paragraph three, the Governor-General is authorized to 
call a special election or fill the place by appointment where a provincial 
officer elect dies prior to taking office, or for any other reason fails to 
qualify. Paragraph 4 provides that in case a special election shall have been 
called and held and shall have resulted in a failure legally to elect the 
provincial officer, the Governor-General shall fill the place by appointment. 
And the last paragraph reads: "A person appointed or elected to fill a vacancy 
in an elective provincial office shall hold for the unexpired term and until the 
qualification of a successor."</p>
<p>Again, section 2412, which applies to the city of Manila, provides that—"if 
any person so elected is ineligible to hold office, or if for any reason there 
should be a failure to elect one or more members, no special election shall be 
called, but the vacancy shall be filled for the term by the Governor-General 
with the consent of the Upper House of the Philippine Legislature. Vacancies in 
the office of member occurring after taking office shall be filled for the 
unexpired term in like manner."</p>
<p>It will thus be seen that the Legislature in sections 2000 and 2412 provided 
for two kinds of vacancies. The first, where vacancies occur by the death, 
resignation, or removal of the incumbent, and the second is where vacancies 
occur by reason of the failure to elect. In both instances the office becomes 
vacant.</p>
<p>In enacting the provisions with reference to elective provincial offices, 
elective municipal offices for the city of Manila and elective municipal offices 
in general, the Legislature was dealing with the same subject-matter. And, in 
view of the fact that no provisions are made for the calling of special 
elections in cases where the election fails or no one is legally elected to a 
municipal office, we must conclude that it was intended that the words "vacancy" 
and "vacancies" occurring in section 2126 should be given the same meaning as 
those in sections 2000 and 2412, otherwise an incumbent of an elective municipal 
office might continue indefinitely.</p>
<p>For the foregoing reasons, the demurrer is overruled and the defendant is 
given five days after notice, within which to answer the complaint. If no answer 
is filed within this time, judgment will be entered in favor of the plaintiff in 
accordance with the prayer of the complaint, with costs against the defendant. 
So ordered.</p><em>Torres, Carson</em>, and <em>Araullo, JJ.</em>, concur.

<p>Moreland, J., dissenting:</p>
<p>The decision in this case gives a new, and to me, very unusual definition to 
the word "vacancy." To hold that a municipal vice-president is entitled to 
possession of the office of a municipal president who still occupies the office 
and who does so under a statute not only authorizing but compelling him to do so 
(Lino Luna <em>vs</em>. Rodriguez, p. 401, <em>ante</em>), seems strange to me. 
To hold that the office of municipal president, while still held by a person 
entitled in law to hold it, is vacant in such sense as to permit it to be filled 
by a municipal vice-president is, it seems to me, to disregard the meaning of 
words.</p>
<p>I am convinced that the court has confused the case where the vacancy is 
caused by the <em>termination of the right or power of the incumbent to hold the 
office</em>, that is, an <em>absolute</em> vacancy, with that which might be 
termed a <em>qualified</em> vacancy, where such <em>right</em> or <em>power</em> 
to hold the office is <em>not terminated</em>, but is authorized and confirmed 
by law, and continues by virtue of express provision of law until the happening 
of a certain event, namely, the <em>election</em> or <em>appointment</em> and 
qualification of his <em>successor</em>. There exists in such case only the 
right to <em>elect</em> or <em>appoint</em> a <em>successor</em>, not the right 
of a <em>designated</em> person to <em>fill</em> the office; and the incumbent 
not only <em>can</em> but <em>must</em> continue in office until the 
<em>election</em> or <em>appointment</em> occurs. There exists no right of 
succession in favor of any given person such as comes into existence on the 
death, resignation and removal of an official. There simply comes into existence 
the <em>power</em> to <em>elect</em> or <em>appoint</em>, not the <em>right to 
succeed</em>. It is in the first case <em>only</em> that a vice-president can 
assume the office of the president; never in the second case.</p>
<p>The court seem also to have overlooked the fact that, in the first case, the 
<em>former incumbent</em> is not <em>succeeded</em> by the new incumbent, but 
the <em>office</em> is <em>"filled"</em> (sec. 2126, Administrative Code); and 
that, in such case, until it is "filled" there is no one who actually holds the 
office and no one who can hold it; whereas, in the second case, there is a 
person who not only actually holds the office, but holds it <em>legally</em> 
under a statute <em>requiring</em> him to hold it.</p>
<p>Section 2126 of Act No. 2657 (the Administrative Code), cited and quoted in 
the opinion of the court, does not assume to provide for the appointment of a 
successor but provides in what cases an office can be "filled" It would not seem 
logical or even sensible that an office can be "filled" when it is already 
full—when it is already occupied by a person who holds it strictly in pursuance 
of law. There is a wide difference between a vacancy in office resulting from 
the death of the incumbent, for example, and that condition which exists when a 
person, by mandate of statute, holds over and continues in possession of the 
office until his successor is elected or appointed and qualifies. Yet this is 
precisely the difference which the court has failed to observe, the opinion 
holding in effect, that no such difference exists. This is necessarily the 
holding as the court declares that a vice-president has the right to assume the 
office of president in both cases. The statute, however, provides that he can do 
so <em>only in the first case</em>.</p>
<p>I believe that the court has also failed to observe that, in proving the 
right of a vice-president to assume the office of a president in both the cases 
named, it proves too much. If the decision of the court is correct then the 
Legislature has overworked itself. There was no need to enact the statute (sec. 
2123, Administrative Code) providing that municipal presidents shall, 
notwithstanding the fixed term prescribed by other provisions of the statute, 
hold over and continue in office until their successors are duly elected or 
appointed and qualify. Under the ruling of the court, this provision is useless 
as no such condition can possibly arise; for the instant the time is propitious 
for it to arise, the vice-president, pursuant to the decision of the court, 
leaps upon the scene, seizes and takes possession of the office, and—Lo and 
behold!—the spectacle of a municipal president holding over and continuing in 
office after the expiration of his term, is rendered impossible. Section 2126 of 
the Administrative Code, as construed by the court, thus prevents the last 
paragraph of section 2123 of the same Code from having any effect whatever, as 
the situation to which it applies can never come into existence.</p>
<p>Thus, the court, by establishing one strange proposition, namely, that an 
office can be "filled" which is already full, thereby necessarily establishes 
another proposition equally strange from the standpoint of section 2123, and 
that is that it is impossible for a municipal president to hold over and 
continue in possession of his office after the expiration of his term, although 
the statute expressly says that he may do so.</p>
<p>The court has also failed to note the significance of the last sentence of 
section 2126 which it quotes. This sentence reads: "A person <em>thus</em> 
called to fill a vacancy shall hold for the <em>unexpired</em> term * * *." Now, 
according to the construction given the statute by the court, there can never be 
an <em>"unexpired"</em> term under section 2123, The instant the president's 
term as fixed by law expires the vice-president assumes the office, and there 
can be no holding over on the part of the president and, therefore, there can be 
no "unexpired" term. The words "unexpired term" indicate, of course, either that 
an officer dies, etc., during his term or he holds over and serves a part of the 
term succeeding that for which he was elected; and that the person who is 
elected or appointed to succeed him will, therefore, be unable to hold for the 
<em>full</em> term but only for the <em>unexpired</em> term, that is, that part 
not already served by the hold-over. This is the clearest kind of evidence of 
the correctness of my contention and, therefore, of the error of the court. The 
court holds that there can be no holding over, as the vice-president succeeds 
and takes possession of the office the instant the president's term expires. As 
a consequence, the last sentence of section 2126 is given no meaning when 
applied to a situation intended to be covered by section 2123 as there can be no 
such thing as an "unexpired" term in such case; and the flood of light which 
comes from it to aid in defining the word "vacancy" as used in section 2126 has 
served no purpose in the decision of this case. From these observations it 
appears that while, under section 2126, the word "vacancy" is used 
<em>exclusively</em> in connection with an <em>unexpired</em> term, the court 
uses the word to cover cases <em>where there can be no unexpired term</em>.</p>
<p>Thus, by construction, the court has not only created a situation in which 
the words "unexpired term" found in section 2126 can have no meaning or effect 
but also has prevented the possibility of an official holding over after the 
expiration of his term, something which section 2123 expressly says he may 
do.</p>
<p>The court, in my judgment, has overlooked another thing which is highly 
important. As nature abhors a vacuum, so the law abhors a vacancy in public 
office; and the first care of the legislator is to prevent the occurrence of 
such a vacancy. This duty the Legislature had in mind when it placed in the 
staute the provision that all elective officers, in spite of the fact that they 
are elected for a definite term, shall hold over and continue in possession of 
their offices until their successors are elected or appointed and qualify. The 
<em>sole</em> purpose of this provision is to <em>prevent</em> vacancies in 
public office. The purpose thus manifested is defeated by the decision of the 
court, not only for the reasons already stated, but also for the further reason 
that it results from the construction given to the statute that the court fills 
one vacancy <em>by creating another</em>. It fills the office of president 
<em>by creating a vacancy in the office of vice-president</em> This is a strange 
way of satisfying a provision of statute the sole purpose of which is to prevent 
vacancies in office. Robbing Peter to pay Paul is a new principle of statutory 
construction.</p>
<p>The court has also failed to look upon the question in a broad way. The 
question is a very simple one. We have two sections of the Administrative Code 
dealing with the question of the occupation of a municipal office. One of them 
has to do <em>exclusively</em> with the occupation of the office af<em>ter the 
term of the incumbent has expired</em>, and no one has been elected or appointed 
to succeed him. The other deals <em>exclusively</em> with cases where the term 
of office has not expired but, <em>during the term</em>, it has been put beyond 
the power of the incumbent to occupy the office further; that is, the <em>right 
and the power to occupy have ceased to exist</em> although the term for which 
the incumbent was elected has not expired. Such an occasion arises on the death, 
resignation, or removal of the official. In such case the term for which he was 
elected has not expired but the elected <em>has not expired</em>. Such an 
occasion arises on the right or power to hold the office has ceased.</p>
<p>Now, section 2123 deals exclusively with a case <em>where the term of office 
has expired</em> and no one has been elected or appointed to succeed the 
incumbent; while section 2126 deals exclusively with a case where the term of 
office has <em>not</em> expired but the <em>incumbent</em>, by his own act or by 
an act of nature or of superior authority or by operation of law <em>has lost 
the power or right to hold the office until the expiration of his term</em>. 
This simple situation has been seized upon by the court and handled in such 
manner that the two sections of the law referred to are put in conflict, the 
court holding that section 2126 covers the same ground as a part of section 
2123. This has caused the error of the court. The decision has confused a 
statute which deals with the <em>term</em> of office with one dealing 
<em>not</em> with the <em>term</em> of office but with the <em>occupant</em> of 
the office—with a situation produced, <em>not by the expiration of or anything 
affecting the term</em> of office but, <em>by something occurring to the 
incumbent</em> of the office. This confusion naturally vitiates any conclusion 
to which the court may arrive.</p>
<p>It is clear, then, that the court has obliterated the distinction between an 
absolute and a qualified vacancy—between a case where there is no one who is 
holding or can by any possibility hold the office, and that where there is a 
person who not only holds and can hold the office but <em>who is compelled by 
law to hold it.</em></p>
<p>It is also clear that the court has refused to permit provisions 6f statute 
to have their natural and intended effect—indeed, any effect at all. Not only 
this; it has interpreted and construed section 2126 of the Administrative Code 
so that it is in conflict with a part of section 2123 of the same Code, the 
result being that a portion of the last named section is applied where, by 
virtue of its express provisions, it cannot apply. Furthermore, and this is more 
interesting still, the court has so interpreted that section that the first part 
thereof is in conflict with the last part; and such is the nature of the 
conflict that the last part ceases to have meaning or application and, as a 
consequence, is virtually stricken from the section. This is done by 
obliterating the words "unexpired term," that is, by making the first part of 
the action applicable to cases where there can be no <em>unexpired</em> 
term.</p>
<p>Of course the Legislature itself labored under no such confusion of terms and 
ideas. To establish its thesis the court does not resort to the wording or the 
very section of the law it is construing. Nor does it even resort to the law 
which deals with the same subject-matter. Instead of considering the law of 
<em>municipal</em> officials, which is the only law under consideration as it is 
the only law applicable, it takes up and considers instead the law relating to 
<em>provincial</em> officials and officials of the <em>city of Manila</em>, 
which is not governed by the Municipal Law. It cites and quotes from section 
2000 of the Administrative Code, which deals exclusively with provincial 
officials, and studies and considers it in detail, referring to the paragraphs 
in succession. It cites and quotes also from section 2412, which applies only to 
the city of Manila, and considers its provisions in the same manner. From a 
detailed study of these two sections, that is of the provincial and city law, 
the court draws a conclusion as to what the Municipal Law ought to be. The law 
of municipal officials is left almost untouched and unconsidered.</p>
<p>For these reasons I dissent.</p></div>
