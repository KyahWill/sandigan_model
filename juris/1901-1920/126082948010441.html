				G.R. No. 3766, October 18, 1907</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. PONCIANO LIMCANGCO,  DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The following facts have  been proven:  (1)  That the accused  Ponciano Limcangco,  had during a considerable time  courted Urbana  del  Kosario, a young woman  under 20 years of age;  (2) that he had carnal intercourse with her;  (3) that he  had promised to marry her;  (4)  that about the month of September, 1906, she had been pregnant for some five months.</p>
<p>The entire defense  consisted  in that the promise of marriage was subsequent, and  not  prior  to  the carnal knowledge, and that  therefore there was no deceit employed in the seduction of the girl.</p>
<p>One of the conclusions of the judgment appealed from is that—</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"According to the letters offered in  evidence, both from those written by the accused to Urbana del Rosario, and from  such as the latter wrote to the accused, there can be no doubt whatever that the promise of marriage was made before any carnal communication between them had taken place."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another conclusion is that—</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"From the time when the accused  became aware  that Urbana del Rosario was pregnant he  abandoned her and refused to fulfill his promise to marry  her."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The lower court sentenced Ponciano Limcangco to  four months of <em>arresto mayor</em> and  to pay  the costs, reserving "the plaintiff's right to recover for damages suffered by reason  of the nonfulfillment of the promise of marriage, and for subsistence.7'</p>
<p>Both parties, the plaintiff and the defendant, appealed from the above judgment.</p>
<p>This  court, upon appeal, does not find any proof of the alleged error in the judgment based upon the fact that the court considered  that, in the commission  of  the  crime, deceit had been employed; rather,  on the contrary, the opinion of the trial court appears to have been correctly founded upon  the statements made in the letters of the accused and  of  the injured party as well as from the testimony of the accused himself.</p>
<p>The defendant testified that his intimacy with Urbana del Rosario began in  February, 1905, and that  in July or August he had carnal communication with her.   Although the latter be  the true date, and not that of  January, 1900, as stated by the young girl, Del Rosario, it appears to be proven, not that the promise of marriage was made after the seduction, as the accused claims, but previous thereto according to the result of the following question  put to Urbana. del Rosario by her attorney:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Q. Is it not true that the first promise of marriage that he made you was,towards the end of February or the beginning of March 1905?—A.  No, sir;  it was made  since January and February."</p>
  <p>And as to the deceit, the accused has  made it evident bv his declarations :</p>
  <p>"Q. Did you not tell her that you loved her before you had any carnal communication with her?—A. Yes,  sir.</p>
  <p>"Q. Did you expect her to believe that you  loved her, and that you courted her with the idea of marrying her?— A. Yes,  sir."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The decision in cassation  of October 2, 1888, is as follows :</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"A promise of marriage, in  order to  constitute that deceit which  leads to the consummation of the crime ,of seduction, requires no solemnity whatever nor any other formality except that of making it in such manner that it may reasonably be believed by the injured  party, considering the antecedents of the case, the persistence and repetition of the offer, and other similar circumstances which give to the offer the appearance of sincerity."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The decision in cassation of April 26,1886, is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"In view of the personal circumstances  of both the accused and the injured party, their uninterrupted love affair prior to the carnal communication,  the progress  of the affection they professed for  each other,  as inferred from the insinuating phrases and suggestions revealed  in the letters written by the former to the latter for the purpose of obtaining her  favor, as well as the fact that the intercourse was preceded by her belief in his  assurance  of a more or less proximate marriage, it can not be doubted that all of the  said  facts taken  together  constitute the deceit which led to the seduction."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although the  appeal  of  the plaintiff can not be the subject  of consideration by this court, yet as the accused lias appealed,  it is the duty  of this court  to see that the final judgment is in accordance  with the  law.  For this purpose the provisions of article 449 of the Penal  Code should be applied.</p>
<p>Therefore, the  judgment appealed  from  should be affirmed, although only three months of arresto mayor with the accessories thereof are imposed on the defendant; and we further  sentence  Ponciano Limcangco to  indemnify Urbana del  Rosario in the sum of P500, to recognize the offspring, and to pay  the  costs  of both  instances.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Johnson, Willard,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ., </em>concur.<br>
