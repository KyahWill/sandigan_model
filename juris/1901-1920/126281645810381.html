				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The parties to this action made a contract on the 9th of October, 1902, by the  terms of which the defendant sold to the plaintiff "las cañas que contienen las matas o ponos" upon a certain tract of land described in the contract.  The plaintiff agreed to pay 500 pesos for the bamboo, 300 pesos of which he paid at the time the contract was made, and promised to pay 200 pesos by the 1st of February following. It was agreed that he should not commence the cutting of the bamboo until the last installment had been paid.  This last installment he did not pay until the 7th  day  of April, when it was received by the defendants.   He commenced the cutting in the latter part of April or the first part of May and continued it through the succeeding months until the 8th day of August, when the defendants prevented him from cutting any more.  The plaintiff testified  that  at the time he was so prohibited by the defendants he had cut about one-half of the bamboo which he was entitled to cut and he brought  this action to recover  damages  for the interference by the defendants with his right to  cut the remaining bamboo.  He recovered judgment in the court below and the defendants have brought the case here by bill of exceptions.</p>
<p>The principal dispute between the parties is as to whether the contract fixed any time by which he must  finish the cutting.   The contract was written in Tagalog and contains a clause, the correct translation of which in Spanish is as follows: "Con la condicion de que el corte de cañas sera desde el 1. 
de Febrero de 1903  hasta el ultimo de Abril venidero."  The contract does not say, as claimed by the plaintiff, that he  was entitled to commence  cutting between the first day of February and the last day of April, leaving the time when he should finish the  cutting unprovided for.  There was evidence in the case tending to show that in contracts  of this kind  for the cutting of bamboo the time when the cutting is  to be made has an important bearing upon the future growth of the bamboo. By the terms of  the contract the plaintiff was  bound to finish the cutting before the first of May.   He did not do it and is, therefore, not entitled to recover  any damages. He testified at the trial that he had a verbal agreement with the defendants that the time should be extended until June or July.  This was denied by one of the defendants, but, even if it was on this point so found in favor of the plaintiff, it would not help him any because, as a matter of fact, the  defendants did let  him continue to  cut until the 8th of August.</p>
<p>The judgment of the court below is reversed, and  the case remanded with directions to the court below to enter judgment in favor of the defendants upon the merits.  No costs will be allowed to either party in this  court.   After the expiration of  twenty days let judgment  be entered in accordance herewith, which ten days thereafter shall be remanded to the  lower court  for execution thereof.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano,  C. J., Torres, Mapa, Johnson,  Carson,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
