				<h4>
				G.R. No. 12213, September 12, 1917</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. ANGEL ANG, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The purpose of the present action was to deport the defendant and appellant 
from the Philippine Islands for the reason that he was found therein without the 
certificate required by Act No. 702, upon the theory that he was a Chinese 
subject and a laborer. The lower court found that he was a full-blooded 
Chinaman, that he was a laborer and was without the certificate required by said 
Act No. 702, and ordered him to be deported. From that judgment the defendant 
appealed to this court.
<p>An examination of the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause shows 
that the defendant was born within the Philippine Islands of a Chinese father 
and a Filipino mother; that while he had spent a short time in China during his 
minority he has continued to live within the Philippine Islands practically all 
of his lifetime. These facts are proved without contradiction. While he may have 
the appearance of a full-blooded Chinaman, as the lower court found, that fact 
is not sufficient to deport him, in view of the fact that he was born within the 
Philippine Islands of a Filipino mother.</p>
<p>A child born in the Philippine Islands, had by a Chinaman with a Filipino 
woman, is presumed, <em>prima facie</em>, to be a citizen of the country and was 
not required to register under the provisions of Act No. 702. (U. S. 
<em>vs</em>. Ong Tianse, 29 Phil. Rep., 332; U. S. <em>vs</em>. Lim Bin, p. 924, 
post; U. S. <em>vs</em>. Tan Chuy Ho, 31 Phil. Rep., 383; U. S. <em>vs</em>. 
Wong Kim Ark, 169 U. S., 649, 676, 682, 693.)</p>
<p>Therefore, the judgment of deportation is hereby revoked; and it is hereby 
ordered and decreed that the complaint be dismissed and that the defendant be 
discharged from the custody of the law. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Carson, Araullo, Street,</em> and <em>Malcolm, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p></div>
