				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The material facts upon which our disposition of this appeal necessarily 
turns are set out at length in our opinion in the case of Barretto <em>vs</em>. 
Santa Marina, decided December 2, 1913 (26 Phil. Rep., 200). This court having 
ruled against the plaintiff's contention in the former case, he now sets up a 
claim for interest at the legal rate upon the amount of the purchase price of 
his share (<em>participacion</em>) in the business from the 1st of July, 1909, 
to the 22d day of November, 1910, the day upon which it was turned over to 
him.
<p>The finding of facts, and the reasoning upon which we based our rulings in 
the former case, are manifestly conclusive in the present case as to the 
plaintiff's claim of a right to interest from the first of July, 1909, to the 
third of May, 1910.</p>
<p>In the former case we held that the sale of plaintiff's share 
(<em>participacion</em>) in the tobacco factory was consummated on the latter 
date; that the valuation set upon his share (<em>participacion</em>) in the 
business was determined as of that day by the committee charged with the duty of 
ascertaining the cash value of this share (<em>participacion</em>), in order to 
determine the exact amount which the parties had agreed upon as the purchase 
price to be paid therefor; and that the committee had included the plaintiff's 
share of the profits of the business down to the third of May, 1910, in their 
estimate of the value of his share (<em>participacion</em>) in the business on 
that date. </p>
<p>These rulings were made after a review of the same record which is now relied 
upon by the plaintiff in support of his claim of interest upon the amount fixed 
by the committee as the true value of his share (<em>participacion</em>) in the 
business. We find nothing in the record of the contentions of counsel in this 
regard which would justify or necessitate a modification or reversal of the 
conclusions reached by us in our former opinion.</p>
<p>Plaintiff's share (<em>participacion</em>) in the business having been sold 
on the 3d day of May, 1910, for a stipulated price, that is to say, for its 
value on that day as fixed by the valuation committee, it is very clear that he 
is not entitled to interest on the amount fixed by the committee, prior to the 
date on which the sale was consummated (3d of May, 1910),</p>
<p>So also plaintiff's contention that he should be allowed interest on the 
amount of the purchase price from the date of the sale, May 3, 1910, down to the 
day upon which the money was actually turned over to him, November 22, 1910, 
cannot be sustained. Under the express terms of the agreement for the sale on 
May 3, 1910, the plaintiff agreed to accept, and the defendant to pay, the 
amount which the committee should find to be the true value of plaintiff's share 
(participacion) in the business as of that day. Under the agreement the 
defendant neither expressly nor impliedly obligated himself to pay interest on 
that amount pending the report of the committee. The only contractual obligation 
assumed by him was that he would pay the amount fixed by the committee <em>in 
cash</em> immediately upon the making of the award by the committee, and in 
accordance with its terms.</p>
<p>The committee's report is dated November 14, 1910, and it appears that 
promptly upon the submission of this report, the amount awarded the plaintiff 
(P280,025.16) was paid over by the defendant to the plaintiff in cash; and the 
letter of counsel for plaintiff dated November 17, 1910, tendering a formal deed 
of sale of plaintiff's share (<em>participacion</em>) in the business and making 
demand for the purchase price as fixed by the committee, read together with the 
formal deed of sale executed November 22, 1910, with its acknowledgment of the 
receipt of the purchase price, leaves no room for doubt that at that time the 
parties understood and accepted the purchase price therein set forth as full 
payment of plaintiff's share (<em>participacion</em>) in the business in exact 
conformity with the conditions imposed in the agreement consummated to May 3, 
1910.</p>
<p>The right to interest arises either by virtue of a contract or by way of 
damages for delay or failure (<em>demora</em>) to pay the principal on which 
interest is demanded, at the time when the debtor is obligated to make such 
payment. In the case at bar there was no contract, express or implied, for the 
payment of interest pending the award of the committee appointed to value the 
property sold on May 3, 1910, and there was no delay in the punctual compliance 
with defendant's obligation to make immediate payment, in cash, of the amount of 
the award, upon the filing of the report of the committee.</p>
<p>We conclude that the judgment entered in the court below dismissing the 
complaint in this case <em>sine die</em> should be affirmed, with the costs of 
this instance against the appellant. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson, Street, Malcolm</em>, and <em>Avance√±a, 
JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Araullo J.</em>, did not take part.</p></div>
