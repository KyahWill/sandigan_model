				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On the 20th day of June, 1905, the  provincial fiscal of the Province of Pampanga presented a complaint in the court of said province against Pedro Flores and  Jacinto Sonsa, accusing said persons del delito de lesiones mutuas.</p>
<p>On the 11th  day  of July, 1905, the defendant, Pedro Flores, was  duly arraigned  upon  said  complaint  and pleaded "not guilty."  On the 14th day  of July of the same year the attorney for the defendant,  Pedro Flores, presented a motion in the lower court asking  that his client be given a separate trial and that the court order the fiscal to present a complaint against each of  the accused, which motion was duly granted.</p>
<p>On the 18th day of July,  1905,  the fiscal of said province presented a separate complaint against the defendant, Pedro  Flores, charging him  with the  crime  of  lesiones graves, and on the 22d day of July of the same year the defendant,  Pedro  Flares,  was  arraigned  upon the new complaint, charging him with the said crime of lesianes graves, and he pleaded "not guilty" to the crime charged in the new complaint, without having made any objection thereto.   The objection, therefore, being made for the first time in  this court, it can  not be considered.   (U. S. <em>vs</em>. Sarabia, 4 Phil. Rep., 566;  U.  S. <em>vs</em>. Cajayon, 2 Phil. Rep., 570; U. S. <em>vs</em>.  Mabanag, 1 Phil. Rep., 441.)</p>
<p>After hearing the evidence adduced during the trial, the lower court sentenced the defendant to be imprisoned for a period of four years of prision correctional in accordance with the provisions of  paragraph 2 of article 216<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Penal Code, with the  accessory  penalty of article 61 of said code, and to indemnify the person injured, Jacinto Sonsa, in the  sum of P40, and,  in case of insolvency, to suffer subsidiary imprisonment with a deduction of onehalf of the prision preventive which he may have, suffered, and to the payment  of  the costs of this instance.  From this decision the defendant appealed to this court.</p>
<p>An examination of the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause shows beyond peradventure of doubt that the defendant committed the crime in the  manner and form charged  in  said complaint.  Therefore the judgment of the  lower court  is hereby  confirmed with   costs.  So ordered.</p>
