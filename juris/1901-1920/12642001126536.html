				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. NICOLAS MATINONG ET AL.,  DEFENDANTS,  NICOLAS MATINONG, APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>MAPA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The information in the present cause was as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "The  undersigned,  amending the  previous complaint, charges  Nicolas  Matinong,  Francisca  Magsipoc, present, and Cornelio Jinaya,  Justo Jinaya, Ysaias Martinez, Cirilo N, Fausto N and Basilio N, absent, with the crime of <em>robo en cuadrilla</em> with homicide, committed  as follows:</p>
  <p>"On or about the night of April 15, 1910, in the barrio of Caticlan, within the  municipality of  Bumanga of this Province of Capiz, P. I., the accused, having formed a band of  more than three malefactors,  provided  with <em>talibones,</em> did, unlawfully, willfully and criminally, assault the house of Francisco Tolosa and, after having seized, Violently and with intent of gain, money and other effects  belonging to Francisco Tolosa and his family, which amounted in value to P908,35, did treacherously kill the said Tolosa; in violation of law."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The case having been prosecuted against Nicolas Matinong and Francisca Magsipoc only, for the  reason that the other accused had not been apprehended, the court acquitted the latter and sentenced the former, Nicolas Matinong, to the  penalty of life imprisonment, with the accessories of the law, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the  sum of P1,000, and to pay an additional  sum of P908.35, as an indemnity for the effects robbed, and one-half of the costs of the trial.</p>
<p>The  case has come before this court through an appeal by Nicolas Matinong from the foregoing judgment.</p>
<p>The  evidence fully  demonstrates the appellant's guilt. As  the Attorney-General  says  in  his brief,  it  has  been satisfactorily proven  that  it  was the said appellant  who proposed to his companions the assault upon the house of Francisco Tolosa; that,  armed with a <em>talibon,</em>  he accompanied them during the assault; that, while the assault was being made, he stood watch at the foot of the stairs of the said house so that his companions would not be caught, and that, finally, he accompanied them to the place  where  the deceased was killed.   These  facts  evidently  render  him responsible as  a principal by direct participation in the crime with which he is charged  in  the information.</p>
<p>There is to be considered, in the commission of the crime, the attendance of the aggravating circumstance of treachery embracing that of the criminal act having been perpetrated at night in an  uninhabited place (as was the place where the deceased was killed) and by a band,  as an integral part of  the plan formed by the accused for the commission of the crime with security to themselves and without risk.</p>
<p>The  Attorney-General suggests  that  the  aggravating circumstance of premeditation should also  be taken into account.  It is unquestionable that there was premeditation with respect to the robbery, but, as it  is inherent in this latter crime, it should not be considered as an aggravating circumstance.  There is not sufficient  proof that the death of the deceased was premeditated by the accused.  It may very well have happened  that the resolution  to  kill Francisco Tolosa arose in the minds of the accused at the last minute as a result of some unforeseen incident which may have occurred  during the course  of events.  We may cite, as an example, the occurrence related in the following words by Luis Dagono,  a witness for the prosecution:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"When they  (the malefactors) arrived, that man who was holding me asked Asis  (the deceased)  the question: 'Do you know me?"  Asis answered: 'Yes.'  When Asis answered that he knew him, that man, this party Cornelio, unsheathed his <i>talibon</i> and gave Asis a cut with it  on the head."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This appears to indicate that the malefactors commenced to wound the deceased as soon as the latter showed that he knew some  of them, and that,  had not  this  incident occurred, possibly they might not have taken his life.  Be this as it may, the fact remains that, aside  from the fact itself of the death of the deceased, there is  no conclusive proof in the record that the accused premeditated the taking of their victim's life, in the  legal and technical  sense  of the word <em>premeditation</em> as a term of law.</p>
<p>After due examination of all the circumstances  of the case, we are of the  opinion that the trial judge was right ,  in giving the appellant the benefit of the extenuating circumstance of article 11 of the Penal Code, and which must be set off against the aggravating circumstance of <em>alevosia</em> found in this decision to have existed.  It  is, therefore, proper to impose upon the said appellant the  penalty of <em> cadena perpetua</em>, which was done in the judgment appealed from.</p>
<p>The said judgment is affirmed,  with the  costs  of this instance against the appellant.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson,  Carson,</em>  and <em>Trent, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
