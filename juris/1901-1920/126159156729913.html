				G.R. No. 2705, July 31, 1906</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES,  COMPLAINANT AND  APPELLEE, VS.  ALBERTO GONZALEZ, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>WILLLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The defendant at the time  in question was a justice of the peace in the municipality  of Kaibiran, in the Province of Leyte.   As such" justice of  the peace he tried Ambrosio de los Reyes for the crime  of <em>estafa</em>, convicted him, and. sentenced him  to  four  months  of imprisonment.  This prosecution was afterwards commenced against the defendant for "arrogacion de atribuciones."</p>
<p>The complaint does not mention  the article of the Penal Code for the violation of which the defendant is prosecuted nor does the judgment mention the article under which he is condemned. We assume, however, that he was convicted for a violation of article 194 of the  Penal Code.</p>
<p>The most that can be said against the defendant is that while exercising judicial functions he made a  mistake in his interpretation of the law and thought that as long as the penalty which he inflicted was less  than six months he had jurisdiction of  the case, although from its nature a penalty of  more than  six months might have been  imposed.  The case  is fully covered by the decision of this court in the case of the United States <em>vs</em>. Florentino Rallos,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> April 24, 1905 (3 Off. Gaz.,  408).  The court there said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"There is no doubt that this act confers upon the president judicial functions.  He^was exercising such functions when he tried Francisco del Mar, Magno Seno, and others for a violation of the  ordinances  against gambling.   He therefore does not come within the provision of said article 194  nor within the  provisions of article 374 of the same code.  He did not by those proceedings arrogate to himself judicial functions, but he was then exercising judicial functions conferred upon him by law.</p>
  <p>"The fact that in the exercise of such functions he may have committed an  error in declaring Magno  Seno guilty of perjury and  punishing him therefor, or that he may have committed an error in punishing him at all when no complaint had been filed against him, does not alter the case.  These were, perhaps, errors; committed by a judicial officer in the exercise of his duties, but such errors do not constitute  a violation  of  either  of the articles above mentioned."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The judgment  of the court below is reversed and the defendant  acquitted, with the costs  of both instances <span style="font-style: italic;">de oficio</span>.   After the expiration of ten days  from the date of final judgment let the case be remanded to the lower court for proper procedure.   So ordered.</p>
<em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Carson,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
