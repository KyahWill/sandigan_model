				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This action was commenced in the Court of First Instance of the city of 
Manila on the 15th day of February, 1913. Its purpose was to have declared 
escheated to the city of Manila certain property situated in and around said 
city; that said property consists of five parcels of land located in the 
districts of Malate and Paco of the city of Manila, as shown in a plan, in the 
office of the Department of Engineering and Public Works of said city of Manila, 
No. B-10-27. The theory of the plaintiff is that one Ana Sarmiento was the owner 
of said property and died in the year 1668 without leaving "heir or person 
entitled to the same."
<p>After hearing the evidence, the Honorable A. S. Cross-field, in a carefully 
prepared opinion, reached the conclusion that the prayer of the plaintiff should 
be denied without any finding as to costs. From that conclusion the plaintiff 
appealed to this court and made a number of assignments of error.</p>
<p>After an examination of the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause, 
we find that the following facts were proved by a large preponderance of the 
evidence: That Ana Sarmiento resided, with her husband, in the city of Manila 
sometime prior to the 17th day of November, 1668; that on said date she made a 
will; that on the 23d day of November, 1668, she added a codicil to said will; 
that on the 19th day of May, 1669, she made another will, making a part thereof 
the said codicil of November 23d, 1668; that said will contained provisions for 
the establishment of a <em>"Capellania de Misas;"</em> that the first chaplain 
of said capellania should be her nephew Pedro del Castillo; that said will 
contained a provision for the administration of said property in relation with 
the said <em>"Capellania de Misas"</em> succeeding that of her nephew Pedro del 
Castillo; that such subsequent administration should continue 
<em>perpetually</em>; that said Ana Sarmiento died about the year 1672; that for 
more than two hundred years the intervener, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of 
Manila, through his various agencies, has administered said property; that the 
Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila has rightfully and legally succeeded to the 
possession and administration of said property in accordance with the terms and 
provisions of the will of Ana Sarmiento. </p>
<p>Section 750 of Act No. 190 provides when property may be declared escheated. 
It provides, "when a person dies intestate, seized of real or personal property 
* * * leaving no <em>heir</em> or <em>person</em> by law entitled to the same," 
that then and in that case such property, under the procedure provided for by 
sections 751 arid 752, may be declared escheated.</p>
<p>The proof shows that Ana Sarmiento did not die intestate. She left a will. 
The will provides for the administration of said property by her nephew as well 
as for the subsequent administration of the same. She did not die without an 
heir nor without persons entitled to administer her estate. It further shows 
that she did not die without leaving a person by law entitled to inherit her 
property. In view of those facts, therefore, the property in question cannot be 
declared escheated as of the property of Ana Sarmiento, If by any chance the 
property may be declared escheated, it must be based upon the fact that persons 
subsequent to Ana Sarmiento died intestate without leaving heir or person by law 
entitled to the same.</p>
<p>The will clearly, definitely and unequivocally defines and designates what 
disposition shall be made of the property in question. The heir mentioned in 
said will evidently accepted its terms and permitted the property to be 
administered in accordance therewith. And, so far as the record shows, it is 
still being administered in accordance with the terms of said will for the 
benefit of the real beneficiary as was intended by the original owner.</p>
<p>The record fully and completely shows that the theory of the plaintiff is 
without foundation either in fact or in law.</p>
<p>The judgment of the lower court is, therefore, hereby affirmed, with costs in 
this instance. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Araullo, Street</em>, and <em>Malcolm, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p></div>
