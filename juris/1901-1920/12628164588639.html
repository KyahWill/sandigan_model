				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The proceedings for the settlement of the estate of Juan Urian and his wife, Maria Nullen, who died intestate, must have been commenced in the year 1894, for it is alleged in the third paragraph of the .complaint that some time in February, 1894, as  a result of the intestate  proceedings instituted by the first two defendants  and others,  the former Court of  First Instance of  the  Province  of La Laguna ordered that an inventory be made of the property left by the deceased Urian and his wife. The other defendant in this case, Felipe  Onrade, was appointed receiver and administrator of the said property.   There were included in the said inventory  and turned over  to the receiver 12 tracts of land, 2,000 cocoanut trees, and 80 <span style="font-style: italic;">cavanes </span>of palay which the plaintiffs in this action claimed to be theirs, asking in their complaint that the same be returned to them and that they be  paid  6,458 pesos as indemnification for the fruits and earnings of which they had been deprived, and that the defendants pay the costs.   The court below made the following findings of fact:  (a) That in 1894 when the proceedings relating to the administration of the estate of Juan Urian were commenced, the property involved in this action was included in the inventory then made,  at the suggestion of those who instituted the said proceedings, the defendant Onrade having been  appointed administrator of the said  property (record, pp. 22, 30, 32, and 94);  (b) that three  or four years prior  to the date of the inventory the plaintiffs were in the adverse possession of the  said property,, part of  which they purchased from Juan Urian, part they inherited from him, and the remainder they  purchased  from his  heirs, they having reported in the old registry of property of the Province of La Laguna  the possessory information proceedings instituted by them evidencing their title  to the property in question  (record, pp. 31,  32, 35,  and 103); and (c) that in view of said inscription the plaintiffs brought an action in the former Court of First Instance of  the Province of La Laguna  to have  the said property excluded from the inventory in question, the  record of the case as well as the intestate proceedings having been lost during the last insurrection (record, pp. 22, 32, 37, and 94).</p>
<p>It should  be noted that this  action has been continued between the plaintiffs and the administrator and receiver Felipe Onrade only, the other defendants Diego Urian and Felix Urian having died.   The court below  decided that these parties were sufficient for the adjudication of the case without prejudice to the rights  of the heirs of the deceased Urian, in accordance with section 122 of the Code of Civil  Procedure.  The court  after hearing the evidence introduced by the parties entered judgment directing (1) that the defendant Felipe Onrade should cease to administer  the property,  which is the subject of this action, and render an account to the court of his administration in accordance with law; (2) that the said defendant should leave the said property in the possession of the plaintiffs as well as the 2,000 cocoanut trees and  the 80 <span style="font-style: italic;">cavanes </span>of palay, or pay their value at the market price; (3)  that the right is reserved to the person interested  to bring an action to recover the ownership of the said property and the indemnification  for damages from the proper party; and (4) that each party pay one-half of the costs of proceedings. The bill of exceptions having been presented, it was settled and sent tip to this court where the case was duly submitted.</p>
<p>The errors assigned  by the appellant are six in  number and they are as follows: "(1)  The court below erred in finding that the plaintiffs had acquired the property which is the subject of this action, part by purchase from Juan Urian, part by inheritance from him, and part by purchase from  the other  heirs of the said Urian; (2)  the  court below erred  in finding that the plaintiffs  had inscribed their right in a possessory proceeding  recorded in the old Registry of Property of the Province of La. Laguna; (3) the court below erred in finding that the  plaintiffs had instituted an  action of <em>terceria</em>, or  an action  for the exclusion of said property,  in the Court of  First Instance of the Province of  La Laguna, since abolished, in regard to the property involved  in  this case; (4) the court below erred in considering the testimony of Esteban Arabes, Sergio Hombrebueno, and Pedro  Labares as secondary evidence of the contents of alleged possessory information proceedings of  the property described in the complaint j (5) the court below erred in deciding that by  reason  of the fact that the plaintiffs were in possession of the property in question in the year 1894, and that the defendant came into the possession  of the same  in that year as receiver, appointed by  the court in  the proceedings relating to the settlement of the estate of the deceased Juan Urian, the said defendant having continued in possession of the property up to the present  time  as such judicial administrator, the plaintiffs should be restored to the possession formerly held by them, thus disregarding entirely the fact that there is no evidence sufficient  to establish plaintiffs' title  to  the said property;  (6)  the court erred  in considering this action as an action for possession and not as an action in which  the title of the plaintiff was the subject of adjudication."</p>
<p>This court holds  that it can not enter upon a discussion of the first four assignments of error  relied upon by the appellant, and that it is bound by the findings of fact contained in the judgment of the  court below and to which the said four assignments of error  relate, for the reason that it does not appear that the decision of the trial court upon this point  is manifestly against the weight, of the evidence.  This court can only  review  the evidence taken at the trial, under section 497, paragraph 3, of the Code of Civil Procedure,  where the decision  of the court below is plainly and manifestly against the weight of such evidence. As to the last two assignments of error this court is of the opinion that they  can not be  sustained in view  of the findings of  fact made by the court  below.</p>
<p>The trial  court found, as set  forth in finding (h), that three or four years prior to the date on which the inventory was  made the plaintiffs  were in  the  adverse possession of the property claimed in this action.   We think, in view of this finding, that that part of  the judgment appealed from wherein it is ordered that the defendant should leave the said property in the possession of the plaintiff, as well as the 2,000 cocoanut trees and the 80 <span style="font-style: italic;"> cavanes </span>of palay, or pay their value at the market price, is in conformity with the law.</p>
<p>The court below committed no error in disregarding the fact that there was not sufficient proof to establish plaintiffs' title to the said property,  since it was sufficient to restore the former condition of affairs as they existed prior to the  institution of the intestate proceedings.  Inasmuch as the  institution of intestate  proceedings  is not a sufficiently legal reason to deprive an adverse possessor of his possession simply because those  who  instituted  such proceedings desired that the property should be included in the property of the estate of the deceased,  or because they think that it should be so included, it is incumbent upon them to introduce sufficient proof to show that the estate is the  owner and is entitled  to such property.  Nor did the court err in considering this action as a mere action for possession and not as an action in which plaintiff's title was at issue, for the reason that in order to ask that the said property  be excluded from the inventory of the property of  the estate of the deceased it was  sufficient for the plaintiffs to show  that  they were in possession, under claim of ownership, of the property,  which, in order to be included in the inventory, had to be taken away from the possession of those who then held  the same under  a claim of title, there being no statute or principle of law which, under Spanish legislation, would require evidence of title in order to ask that the  property claimed by third persons be excluded from the inventory of  the property of the estate of a deceased person.  On the contrary, it is a well-settled principle of law that a person can not under a claim of inheritance enter upon  the possession of property held by another under claim of title or as usufructuary.</p>
<p>There being no provision of law upon  which to base the reversal of  the judgment of  the court  below, we hereby affirm the same, with the costs of this instance against the defendant, Felipe Onrade.</p>
<p>After the expiration of twenty days from.the date hereof let judgment be entered in accordance herewith and ten days thereafter the case he remanded  to the court below for execution.   So ordered.</p>
