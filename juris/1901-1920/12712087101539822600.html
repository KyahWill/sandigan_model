				<h4>
				G.R. No. 9073, September 11, 1914</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. MONICO CUSTAN, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I SI O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The appellant was convicted in the court below of a violation of the Election 
Law, in that he took the elector's prescribed by the general Election Law, on 
the 3d day of May, 1912, although at that time he was delinquent in the payment 
of his taxes in the sum of P1.23. Upon conviction a fine of P200 was imposed by 
the trial judge.
<p>In the court below the accused substantially admitted the truth of the 
allegations in the information, but claimed that he took this oath without 
understanding the requirements of the Election Law, and that the reason for his 
delinquency was that he was awaiting advices from the municipal treasurer as to 
the amount due by him. It appears that he paid the taxes in question on June 29, 
1912, nearly two months after the date when he took the prescribed election 
oath.</p>
<p>The insufficiency of general defenses and excuses of this nature upon charges 
of violations of the Election Law, when unsupported by the most convincing 
evidence, was discussed at length in the cases of United States <em>vs.</em> 
Estavillo (19 Phil, Rep., 478); and United States <em>vs.</em> Tabuyo (19 Phil. 
Rep., 501).</p>
<p>On appeal, counsel contends that the judgment of conviction should be 
reversed, because, as he alleges:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"1. The defendant was not properly identified in the court below.</p>
<p>"2. The arraignment of the accused was not had in accordance with the 
pertinent provisions of General Orders No. 58. </p>
<p>"3. The record does not disclose that the accused was provided with counsel, 
nor that he was informed as to his right to have counsel."</p></blockquote>
<p>Upon the first point it is sufficient to say that the answer of the defendant 
during his, examination at the trial impliedly admitted his identity as the 
person described in the information.</p>
<p>The second contention: is, we think, disposed of by the mere reading of the 
record itself. It appears that at the opening of the trial, the presiding judge 
addressed the following question to the accused:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Q. You are accused of having taken an oath when you were delinquent in the 
payment of your taxes,"â€”which the accused answered as follows:</p>
<p>"A. I do not wish to plead 'not guilty' nor 'guilty.' I wish to tell the 
court something."</p></blockquote>
<p>This was followed by a statement by the accused as to his reasons for failing 
to pay the taxes mentioned in the information, and as to his alleged ignorance 
of the nature and effect of the oath taken by him.</p>
<p>We think that in the absence of affirmative evidence to the contrary, this 
entry in the record justifies us in holding that the accused was in fact 
arraigned, and given an opportunity to plead to the information. It may be that 
there was hot a strict compliance with the provisions of the statute in this 
regard. But even if this were so, we think that it is clear that there was a 
substantial compliance with those provisions: and it affirmatively appearing 
from the record that the accused was fully advised as to the nature of the 
charge against him, was given an opportunity to plead to the charge, and 
thereafter adopted the course which accorded best with the nature of his 
defense, we are unable to say that his substantial rights were prejudiced by any 
informality which may have crept into the proceedings. We conclude therefore 
that if there was error in the proceedings at this stage of the trial, it was at 
most error without prejudice, and as such not sufficient to justify a reversal 
of the judgment entered in the court below.</p>
<p>The contentions of counsel, based upon the fact that the accused appears to 
have gone to trial without counsel and the failure of the record to disclose 
affirmatively that the accused was formally advised of his right to have 
counsel, were discussed at length and decided adversely in the case of United 
States <em>vs.</em> Labial and Abuso (27 Phil. Rep., 82), citing the cases of 
United States <em>vs.</em> Ramirez and Seradoy (26 Phil. Rep., 616), United 
States <em>vs.</em> Go-Lerig (21 Phil. Rep., 426), and a considerable number of 
American authorities.</p>
<p>But while we decline to reverse the judgment entered in the case at bar on 
the ground of alleged irregularities in the proceedings which do not appear to 
have prejudiced the substantial rights of the accused, we do not wish to be 
understood as expressing our tacit approval of such irregularities, or of the 
omission from the record of formal entries affirmatively disclosing the strict 
compliance by the court below with those provisions of law prescribing the 
procedure to be followed in all criminal proceedings. On the contrary, we deem 
it of the utmost importance that criminal trials should proceed, at every step, 
in strict accord with the prescribed rules of procedure, and that care should be 
taken to make the record affirmatively disclose the various incidents of the 
trial in such form as to leave no room for doubt or question as to what actually 
occurred. In a former case we quoted from the case of Beale <em>vs.</em> 
Commonwealth (25 Penn. State, 11, 18), as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We are not to expect too much from the records of judicial proceedings. They 
are memorials of the judgments and decrees of the judges, and contain a general 
but not a particular detail of all that occurs before them. If we should insist 
upon finding every fact fully recorded which must occur before a citizen can be 
punished for an offense against the laws, we should destroy public justice, and 
give unbridled license to crime. Much must be left to intendment and 
presumption, for it is often less difficult to do things correctly than to 
describe them correctly." </p></blockquote>
<p>In that case however, after holding that the omission of an affirmative entry 
in the record showing that the trial judge had advised the accused who appeared 
without counsel of his right to have counsel, was not reversible error, we 
quoted an observation by the supreme court of New Mexico in making a somewhat 
similar ruling, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Notwithstanding this ruling, we would not advise that a custom so honored by 
time and high authority should be disregarded under any circumstances." (2 N. 
M., 160.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Although omissions from the record and irregularities and informalities in 
the proceedings do not always amount to reversible error, nevertheless it is in 
the highest degree incumbent upon the trial courts and their officers, including 
the judges, fiscals, clerks and attorneys, to see that the record sets forth a 
full and complete report of all the incidents of the trial, so far as that is 
humanly possible, and to take care, also, that there is no relaxation in that 
strict compliance with all the prescribed formalities of procedure which 
experience has shown to be necessary to the due administration of justice in 
criminal cases.</p>
<p>We are convinced that the slovenly and careless manner in which some of the 
records of criminal cases brought here on appeal appear to have been kept in the 
courts below is not infrequently indicative of a laxity or informality in all 
the proceedings which reflects on the various officers of the courts wherein 
these records originate, including the judge, the clerk, the fiscal, and the 
attorneys. These observations are made at this time, in the hope that, the 
attention of the trial courts having been directed to these matters, we may look 
forward to a decided improvement in the conduct of the proceedings in those 
courts in criminal cases, and in the manner in which the records of those cases 
are prepared and preserved.</p>
<p>The judgment entered in the court below convicting and sentencing the 
appellant should be affirmed, with the costs of this instance against him. So 
ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres</em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p>JOHNSON and MORELAND, JJ., concur in the result.</p>
