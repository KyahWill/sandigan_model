				G.R. No. 12439, August 04, 1917</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. SY TOON, CHUA HAM, TIA GUAN, AND FRANCISCA CARMONA, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.

				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The accused were charged in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila 
with knowingly visiting a dive or resort where opium is smoked. The trial judge 
in an exhaustive decision found the defendants guilty as charged and sentenced 
each of them to suffer the penalty of one month's imprisonment, to pay a fine of 
P100, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay one-fourth 
of the costs.
<p>Appellants assign two errors: (1) That the premises in which the defendants 
were arrested is not a dive or resort where opium is smoked; (2) that the trial 
court erred in finding appellants guilty under the proofs. The assignments of 
error can be considered together.</p>
<p>It is admitted that the defendants were arrested at the premises No. 561 Juan 
Luna, city of Manila, which is claimed to be a dive or resort where opium is 
smoked, and that the substance produced at the trial was opium. When we pass on 
to consider whether or not in police jargon this place was "an opium joint," we 
meet with difficulty. Necessarily, this must be true, for the consummation of 
crimes such as those relating to a violation of opium law requires secrecy. They 
can usually only be established by proof of facts and circumstances, from which 
the inference of guilt is so strong as to exclude reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>What in the present case are the facts and circumstances which tend to 
indicate that the defendants were visiting an opium joint? Briefly, they are 
these:</p>
<p>The doors of the house were strongly barricaded. The doors were constructed 
of heavy timbers with iron bolts slipped on the inside. Small quantities of 
opium were found. Opium fumes were detected. The house had the reputation of 
being an opium joint. Arrests had been made there previously for violation of 
the opium law. One policeman testified that he had raided this particular house 
fifty times.</p>
<p>The appellants rely on the case of U. S. <em>vs.</em> Ong To ([1914] 28 
Phil., 216) to substantiate their claim that evidence of the general reputation 
of the house was improperly admitted. In connection with this case and its 
applicability here, it is sufficient to note one fact: The defendant and 
appellant in the cited case was the lessee of the opium joint, while in the 
present case the defendants and appellants were only visitors, who had no 
control over the house.</p>
<p>Cases of somewhat analogous character are those which concern the keeping of 
disorderly houses. In such a case, that of State <em>vs</em>. Steen ([1904] 101 
N. W., 96), it was said that—</p>
<p>"In cases of this nature also, the statute permits a species of evidence not 
usually admissible in criminal cases—evidence of the general reputation of the 
house."</p>
<p>We think, therefore, that it is sufficiently established that the premises 
No. 561 Calle Juan Luna, city of Manila, was an opium joint, and that the 
defendants knowingly visited it as such. If the defendants had a valid excuse 
for their presence in this house, the burden of proof was upon them. (U. S. 
<em>vs</em>. Ten Yu [1912], 24 Phil., 1, 8; State of Indiana <em>vs</em>. 
Bridgewater [1908], 171 Ind., 1.) The excuses presented by the defendants were 
weak and failed to establish legitimate justification.</p>
<p>The judgment of the lower court is affirmed, with costs of this instance 
against the appellants. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Carson, Araullo</em>, and <em>Street, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p></div>
