</blockquote>
<p>This complaint was  filed on the 19th  of  October, 1904. Under this complaint a warrant of arrest was issued and the defendant was arrested and brought before the court on the 21st of October, 1904, and gave bond for his appearance for trial.</p>
<p>On the 2d day of November, 1904, the defendant, through his attorneys, presented the following motion:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Now comes the defendant, by his attorneys, and moves the court that the complaint filed against him in this case be made more definite and certain in this:</p>
  <p>"(1)  That there be  stricken out of said  complaint all that there  is set  forth in said complaint relative  to the defendant being a major  in the United States Army.</p>
  <p>"(2)  That there be set forth in the said complaint specifically what office the defendant held under the United States Civil Government  in the Philippine  Islands,  when he was appointed thereto;  by whom he was appointed thereto, and when he qualified."</p>
  <p>On the same day the defendant, through  his attorneys, presented the following demurrer:</p>
  <p>"Comes now the defendant and hereby demurs to the complaint  herein filed against him  for  the  following reason:</p>
  <p>"That the facts alleged in  the  complaint are not sufficient to constitute a public offense."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon the 12th day of December, 1904, the judge of the Court of First Instance, after hearing the attorneys for the defendant, as well as the attorney for the State, denied the said motion  and overruled the said demurrer.   The record does not disclose that any  exception was taken to this ruling of the court on the said motion and demurrer.</p>
<p>On the 13th of December, 1904,  the defendant was duly arraigned  in the Court of First Instance of the  city of Manila and pleaded "Not guilty" to the charges contained in said complaint.</p>
<p>The trial proceeded in the Court  of First Instance of the city of Manila on the 24th day of January, 1905.   After hearing the evidence adduced during the trial of said cause, the court found the defendant guilty of the crime charged in the complaint and sentenced him to be imprisoned for the period of twelve years and one day and to pay the costs. From this decision the defendant appealed to this court.</p>
<p>The defendant assigns the following reasons in this court for the reversal of the sentence imposed by the inferior court:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"(1)  That the document  set out in  the complaint  was not falsified.</p>
  <p>"(2)  That the document set out in the complaint is not a public document, at least it was  not such a document at the time  the appellant  signed  the incorrect certificate thereto attached.</p>
  <p>"(3)  The document set forth in the complaint was not a public document because it was  not  issued by a public functionary.</p>
  <p>"(4)  The complaint itself shows that the appellant did not hold any official position.</p>
  <p>"(5)  The case should likewise be reversed for the reason that there is no legal record in the Supreme Court of  any trial had in the Court of First Instance.  It appears that the stenographer took down the testimony in English; that it  was only translated after the trial  into  Spanish;  the Spanish translation in this court is not the record of the court' below.  The appellant does not know whether  it is correct or not.</p>
  <p>"(6)  Exhibit A, the  document  that  the appellant  is charged with having falsified, must be a public document by reason of pertaining to some office or having been issued, made, or executed by a person who was an officer, by reason of which official status of the author the document acquired the nature of a public document.</p>
  <p>"(7)  The appellant is an officer of the Army of the United States and was, at the time of the alleged offense, in command of a battalion of Filipino Scouts, stationed at Caloocan, Province of Rizal; the appellant is therefore a Federal officer and was, at the time of the alleged offense, in the Philippine  Islands by virtue of orders emanating from the President, the constitutional Commander in Chief of the Army of the United States.  As a soldier, therefore, the appellant, owing implicit obedience to the President of the United States, could  and would have been brought to the Philippine Islands by military  force, if he had for any reason refused to come voluntarily,  in obedience to orders.   We  therefore ask the question whether the appellant, who  must obey the  orders of the Commander-in-Chief by virtue of the provisions of the  Constitution, is protected wherever he may be by the guaranties of the same Constitution, by virtue of  which  his superiors  command him."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These various assignments of error present to this court the following questions;</p>
<p>(1) Was the defendant, at the time of his trial, entitled to the right of trial by jury?</p>
<p>(2) Did the defendant, in performing the acts set forth in the complaint, act  as  a public functionary?</p>
<p>(3) Was the document set out in the complaint a public document?</p>
<p>(4) Was the defendant guilty of falsifying the  document set out in the said complaint?</p>
<p>The cause of the United States vs. Dorr<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> has settled the question with reference to the right of trial by jury in the Philippine Islands. The defendant, however, claims that, notwithstanding the fact  that citizens of the Philippine Islands are not entitled to the right of trial by jury, he, as a member of the American Army, and being in the Philippine Islands not by  his own wishes, but by order of the President of the United States, is entitled to such trial. This right is based upon  the fact that,  being compelled under the order of the President of the United  States to come to the Philippine Islands, he does not thereby lose the privileges under the Constitution of the United  States in this particular.  In the United States each State of the Union has the right  to establish its own method of trial and procedure in both civil and criminal cases,  and it has been decided time after time, both by the  State courts as  well as by  the  Supreme Court of the United  States, that a State, if it saw fit, could deprive its  citizens of the right of trial by jury, notwithstanding the provision of the guaranty of the Constitution of the United States.   Suppose, then, that the defendant, under an order of  the President of the United States, was sent into a particular State, which State did not provide a trial by jury,  and the defendant while there should violate the laws of that State. Could he in the courts of that State, where no machinery was provided for the trial of cases by jury,  insist upon being tried by a jury under the Constitution of the United States, which has no force or effect in such State?   We are of the opinion that when  any citizen, whether  he be a member  of the United  States Army or not,  goes  into a particular Territory or State of the Union and violates the laws thereof, he is subject to be tried according to  the rules laid down in  such  Territory or State,  so long as  the procedure adopted in such  Territory or State provides for a fair and impartial trial.   Moreover,  it has been decided in numerous eases that a State might provide for  a jury composed of a different number of men than that  required under the Constitution of the United States in the courts of the United States.  Suppose again  that the defendant was in a State or Territory which provided for a trial by a jury of two men instead of twelve:  Could he insist upon having a jury of  twelve men?  We think not. The only way that a  person can avoid being tried in the courts of the different Territories or States of the United States in accordance  with  the rules of  practice and procedure in such Territory or State, is not to violate the laws of such Territory or State.  While in  such Territory or State if he violates the will of the sovereign of such Territory or State he is subject to be punished in  accordance with the practice and procedure in such Territory or State.</p>
<p>Did the defendant,  in performing  the act set forth in the complaint, act as a public functionary?  Article 300 of the Penal Code provides that—</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The penalties of <em>cadena temporal</em> and a fine of from one thousand two hundred and fifty to  twelve thousand five hundred pesetas  shall be imposed upon  a public official who,  taking advantage of his  authority, shall  commit a falsification:</p>
  <p>"1. By counterfeiting or feigning any writing, signature, or rubric;</p>
  <p>"2. By including in any act the participation of persons who had no such participation;</p>
  <p>"3. By attributing to those  who were  present as their acts, declarations or statements different from those which they made;</p>
  <p>"4. By perverting  the truth in the narration of facts;</p>
  <p>"5. By altering true dates;</p>
  <p>"6. By making in a genuine document any alteration or interlineation  altering its meaning;</p>
  <p>"7. By giving out an authentic copy of a fictitious document, or by stating therein a contrary or different  thing from  that contained in the genuine original;</p>
  <p>"8. By intercalating any instrument in a protocol, register, or official  book."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is  charged that the defendant committed a falsification  as a public  official "by perverting the truth in the narration of facts" in the document  set  out in the  complaint  Article 401 of the Penal Code provides that:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"For the  purposes of this and  of the  preceding  titles of this book every person shall be considered a public official  who, by the immediate provisions  of law  or by popular election or appointment by competent authority, takes part in the exercise of public functions."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is asserted that the defendant was appointed by competent authority, and took part in the exercise of public functions, and therefore must be considered as a public official under the provisions of article 300.  The facts relating to his appointment are disclosed by the following documents:</p>
<p>On the 8th  day of October,  1903,  the defendant sent the following letter to Mr.  A.  W. Fergusson, Executive Secretary of the Insular Government for the Philippine Islands:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Sir: I have the honor to submit the following statement for the consideration of the Civil  Governor: As I understand it, the Scout battalion will  be, in a way, a part of the Philippine exhibit at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, and will be quartered on the site set apart for the Philippine exhibit.  I believe the battalion is to be put in tents, but I will require some sort of an administration building in which to conduct the business of the battalion.</p>
  <p>"It has occurred to me that a model building of native materials would serve the  purpose well  and add to the attractiveness of the Philippine section,  as  I  propose to furnish it with native furniture and decorate it with native arms, weapons, wares, etc., and have a room for the reception of Army, Navy, and Philippine civil  officials.  I propose to perform all of the construction work with the labor of my scouts after my arrival at St. Louis.  As the Exposition will then be open it will give the public an opportunity to see Philippine house building in progress.  I estimate that for |3,000, gold, I will be able to buy the  materials, furnishings, etc.,,and put it on the ground.  It will require from three weeks to a month to construct the building.  If the Commission will  authorize the transfer to  me of the necessary funds from  those already appropriated for the Philippine exhibit I feel sure that there will be no cause to regret the step, and myself and my battalion officers will be greatly convenienced thereby, while a pleasing addition will be made to the Philippine exhibit.  Early action is requested in order that I may proceed with the collection of materials.</p>
  <p>"Very respectfully,<br>
    (Signed)  "F. L. CARRINGTON,<br>
    <em>"Major, First Infantry, Commanding Battalion."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the 9th day  of October, 1903, William H. Taft, then Civil Governor, referred the above letter to the Exposition Board, strongly  advising that the  request contained in said letter be granted, and that the Commission should appropriate the amount  named  from  the  appropriation already made for the Exposition Board.</p>
<p>On October 12,1903, the said Exposition Board accepted the proposal  in the  said  letter made by the defendant. This acceptance on the part of the Exposition Board was duly communicated to the defendant by William H. Taft, then Civil Governor, on the 13th of October, 1903.</p>
<p>On the 3d of November, 1903, the honorable Civil Commission of the Philippine Islands enacted  the  following resolution:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"On motion, <em>Resolved</em>, That the disbursing officer of the Philippine Exposition Board be, and he is hereby, authorized and directed to transfer to the credit of Major  F. L. Carrington, First United States  Infantry, commanding the Provisional Battalion of the Philippine Scouts,  to be transferred to St.  Louis in nineteen  hundred and four, in connection with the Philippine exhibit at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, the  sum of three thousand dollars, United  States currency, out of the  general  fund appropriated for the Philippine exhibit, to be used and accounted for by Major Carrington in the construction, by  the members of the battalion in  the  Philippine section of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition grounds, of a model administration building of native materials in which to conduct the business of the  battalion, exhibit weapons, arms, wares, and so forth, and  to contain a reception room for Army, Navy, and Philippine civil officials; and</p>
  <p><em>"Be it further resolved</em>, That the disbursing officer of the Philippine Exposition Board be, and he is hereby, authorized and directed to deposit to the credit of Major Carrington the further sum of five hundred dollars, United States currency, with which to defray in part the expenses  of transportation and maintenance of such families of scouts who may be given permission to accompany the battalion to  St. Louis: <em>Provided, however</em>, That the foregoing resolutions, together with the correspondence, be forwarded to Don Pedro  A.  Paterno, member of the Exposition Board, and Señor Leon Guerrero, secretary of the Board, for their approval  and  concurrence in  these resolutions,  or disapproval of the same,  and the return of all papers to the Civil Governor, who may then, if the resolution be approved, designate Major  Carrington as disbursing officer to receive the funds mentioned in these resolutions."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This resolution was communicated to the said Paterno and Guerrero, and  their acceptance of the propositions contained in said resolution was duly noted in a letter dated the 8th day of November, 1903, directed to the Hon. William H.  Taft, Civil Governor of the Philippine Islands.</p>
<p>In  conformity  with  this acceptance on the part of the said Paterno and Guerrero, the Hon.  William H.  Taft, then Civil Governor, on the 24th day of November,  1903, sent the following letter to the defendant.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Maj. FRANK DB L. CARRINGTON,<br>
    <em>"First United States Infantry, Commanding<br>
    "Provisional Battalion Philippine  Scouts,<br>
    "Caloocan, Rizal</em>.</p>
  <p>"SIR: You are hereby designated to withdraw, receive, expend, and account for  the funds authorized by resolution of the Commission adopted November 3, 1903, to be expended in the preparation and display of a Scout exhibit at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, as set forth in said resolution.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"Very respectfully,<br>
      (Signed)  "WILLIAM H. TAFT, <em>Civil Governor.</em></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In pursuance of the authority granted by the Commission authorizing the defendant to use  the sum of $3,500, United States currency, or P7,000, Philippine  currency, Leon M. Guerrero, secretary of the said Exposition Board, on the 16th day of November,  1903, requested the Auditor of the Philippine Islands to issue in favor of Maj. F. L. Carrington, in his capacity of disbursing officer for Exposition funds, the sum of P7,000, payable out of the civil funds  of the Philippine Islands, pursuant to the appropriation specified  (see minutes of the Philippine Commission of  November  3, 1903), and  for which the said disbursing officer is to be charged and  held accountable. This request was duly approved by the Hon. A. L. Lawshe, Auditor of the  Philippine Islands, as well as by the Hon. William H. Taft,  Civil Governor, through the Assistant Executive Secretary, Frank W. Carpenter, on the 25th day of November, 1903.  On the same day, the 25th  of November,  1903, accountable warrant  No.  4194  was issued by which the sum of P7,000, Philippine  currency, was transferred to the account of  Maj. F. L. Carrington, disbursing officer,  Exposition funds, in the following language:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>"To the Treasurer of the Philippine Archipelago:</em></p>
  <p>"Pay to  Maj. F.  L.  Carrington, disbursing  officer, Exposition funds, or order, the sum of 7,000 pesos, Philippine currency.</p>
  <p align="right">(Signed)  "W.  H. TAFT,<em> Civil Governor,</em><br>
  "A. L. LAWSHE, <em>Auditor</em>,</p>
  <p>"Frank A. Branagan, the Treasurer, Philippine Islands, will pay this warrant.</p>
  <p align="right">(Signed)   "FRANK A. BRANAGAN, Treasurer."</p>
  <p>On the reverse side of this accountable warrant appears the following indorsement:</p>
  <p>"For deposit  to my official credit.</p>
    <p align="right">"Major F. L. CARRINGTON.</p>
    <p>"Official signature:</p>
  <p align="right">"F. DE L. CARRINGTON, <em>Major First Inf."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the face of the said accountable warrant it appears that the same was paid by the Treasurer of the Philippine Islands December 1, 1903.</p>
<p>During the trial of said cause several expense vouchers were introduced in evidence, as well as a check, No. 173001, and also an  account  current rendered by the defendant  for the month of January, 1904,  showing expenditures made by the defendant out of the said money transferred to his account, each signed by the defendant for the purpose  of showing the official  character which he assumed in signing the said vouchers, the check, and the  account-current.  His  signature  to  each  of   these various documents was proven  to  be  genuine.  The signature in each case was as follows: "R de L. Oarrington, Major 1st  Infantry, D. O."</p>
<p>During the trial of said cause it was proven by  competent authority that it  was the  custom of disbursing officers  to  indicate their  official character as disbursing officers by the letters "D.  O."</p>
<p>The above resolution of the Philippine Commission and the appointment of the  defendant  by the  Governor in pursuance  thereof and the acceptance  of the position by the defendant, and  his  actually performing  the  duties imposed  thereby, had the effect of a law  creating the position of disbursing officer of. the funds so designated and  for the purposes mentioned in  said resolution.   No greater  effect  could  have  been  given an  act of the Commission.</p>
<p>From all these foregoing facts we are convinced and find  the fact to be that the defendant acted  as a public official and took part in the exercise of public  functions. (U. S. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Sarmiento, 1 Phil. Rep., 484.)</p>
<p>Was the document set  out in the complaint a  public document?</p>
<p>The document set out in the complaint and alleged to have been falsified by the defendant was made out upon a form entitled "General  Expense Voucher," and known as form "Auditor 125."  It was proven during the  trial of said cause that this form of "General expense voucher" was the form on  which disbursing officers were required to make their  reports of expenditure of public  funds.</p>
<p>RULE 12, section  1,  of  Act No. 90  of  the Philippine Commission  authorizes  the  Auditor  of  the Philippine Islands to make such rules and  regulations and provide such  forms for  the  accounting  of  money expended  by disbursing officers as he may deem  advisable and  necessary.   That rule is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"RULE 12. The Auditor  shall  * * *  prescribe the forms for keeping and rendering all accounts subject to his examination," etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are of the opinion and so  hold  that the document set out in the complaint and alleged  to have been falsified by  the defendant was a public  document, according to the provisions  of article 1216 of the Civil  Code.</p>
<p>Was the defendant guilty of falsifying the document set out in the  said complaint?   The defendant  certified that the  account contained in the document upon  which the complaint was based was correct  and  just; that the services were rendered as stated  in the said  account and were  necessary  for the public service; that the articles purchased had  been taken up in the  property book  of his office  and would be accounted for to the Auditor for the period ending March 31, 1904.  The  said document stated that on  the 10th of  January, 1904, the  defendant had purchased of one Charles  A. Jollie, 2,750 feet  of  hardwood  lumber at P280 per thousand, amounting  to  P770, Philippine currency.   The defendant certified to this fact. The evidence discloses beyond peradventure of doubt that the defendant did not purchase this  lumber of Mr.  Jollie on  the 10th of  January, 1904, or any other quantity of lumber at any  other  time.  We  therefore  hold  that the defendant is guilty of the crime of the  falsification  of a public document as a public  official and should  be punished in accordance with the provisions of article 300 of the Penal Code.  Neither aggravating nor extenuating circumstances attended the commission of the crime; the defendant must  therefore  be punished in  the  medium degree of <em>cadena temporal</em>.   (Par. 1, art.  81.)</p>
<p>The sentence of the inferior court is modified and the defendant is hereby  sentenced to be  imprisoned for a period of fourteen years eight months and  one day  of <span style="font-style: italic;">cadena temporal </span>and to pay a fine of 1,250 pesetas and the costs.  So ordered.</p>
