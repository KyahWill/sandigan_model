				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This case has been before the court on three former occasions (1 Off. Gaz., 
45,<span class="style3"><sup>[1]</sup></span> 346,<span class="style3"><sup>[2]</sup></span> 525<span class="style3"><sup>[3]</sup></span>). 
On April 1, 1902, a judgment for the defendant was reversed, and a new trial 
granted (1 Off. Gaz., 525). Upon the new trial judgment was again ordered for 
the defendant. The plaintiff excepted to the judgment, but did not move for a 
new trial. In the decision of December 3, 1902 (1 Off. Gaz., 45), in proceedings 
to settle a bill of exceptions, we held that we could not weigh the evidence nor 
retry the questions of fact. Certain exceptions, however, appear in the record, 
which will be considered.
<ol><li>The case was tried originally in the special court of the Island of Negros, 
created by Act No. 166 of the Commission. When the first judgment was reversed 
and a new trial ordered it was retried in the same court, against the objection 
and exception of the plaintiff. His claim is, that a new trial having been 
ordered, it became a new case and consequently was not a case pending on June 
16, 1901. There is nothing in this point. There was only one suit pending 
between the parties. The new trial was a new trial of the old case.<br><br></li><li>The plaintiff claims that Judge Norris, having tried the case once, was 
disqualified to try it the second time. Section 504 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure allows the Supreme Court, when a new trial is granted, to designate 
another judge for that purpose. This is not mandatory, however. Judge Norris was 
competent to try the case.<br><br></li><li>The court below, in its decision, found that the defendant had acquired 
title by prescription to the use of the waters of the canal in question, and 
that when the municipality of Granada closed the canal it was acting without 
authority, and was a mere trespasser. The appellant assigns this holding as 
error. It is not necessary to determine this question, because the court found 
also as a fact that after the canal had been "closed the defendant opened 
another canal which furnished the plaintiff the same power with which to operate 
his mill as had the old one, and that he had not been damaged by the act of the 
municipality. The plaintiff was not therefore entitled to rescind the lease by 
reason of this act. <br><br>The appellant insists that the evidence showed that 
the new canal did not furnish the same power as the old one, but as has been 
said before, we have no power to retry that question of fact.<br><br></li><li>We have already held that the failure of the defendant to furnish the carts 
called for by the contract was no ground for its rescission. (1 Off. Gaz., 
525.)<br><br></li><li>By the contract of lease the defendant let to the plaintiff the hacienda 
called "Rosario." It was stated therein that it contained about 600 hectares, 
and the boundaries thereof were given. The plaintiff claims as one of his 
grounds for rescission that the hacienda included the tract known as " 
Lausurica," of which the defendant never put him in possession. The court made 
the following findings upon this point:<br><br>"It is clearly seen from the 
evidence that when the plaintiff took possession of the Rosario estate, which 
was when the contract of lease was drawn up, the representative of defendant 
accompanied the plaintiff and designated the land and boundaries of the said 
estate; that the lands which were delivered and the boundaries which were 
designated did not include the parcel called 'Lausurica.'<br><br>"That the 
plaintiff remained in possession of the said estate for more than a year, 
without making any claim for said parcel of land, and that the first claim 
advanced by him in connection therewith was when he asked for the rescission of 
the contract, founding said claim on other grounds. No evidence whatever has 
been presented for the purpose of showing that the Rosario estate has not an 
area of 600 hectares, more or less, exclusive of the parcel called ' Lausurica,' 
and the court finds that it was not the intention of any of the parties to said 
contract of lease to include said parcel of land, and that the plaintiff has not 
proved his allegation in respect to this point."<br><br>These findings are 
conclusive against the plaintiff, as we can not review the evidence for the 
purpose of seeing if they are supported by it.<br><br></li><li>At the commencement of the introduction of evidence at the trial the 
plaintiff asked that the court appoint a commission to survey and make a plan of 
the hacienda, according to the boundaries described in the lease, and to measure 
the motive power furnished by each of the two canals. He excepted to the refusal 
of the court to appoint such a commission. This was not a refusal by the court 
to receive evidence offered by the plaintiff. He should himself have procured 
these experts, caused them to survey the land and measure the water, and then 
present them as his witnesses at the trial. As is said by the defendant's 
counsel in his brief, it was not the duty of the court to make, at its expense, 
an investigation for the purpose of ascertaining if the facts alleged in the 
plaintiff's complaint were true or not.<br><br>The motion of the plaintiff that 
a commission of accountants be appointed to ascertain what the plaintiff's 
damages were, was properly denied for the same reason.<br><br></li><li>The fact that one of the witnesses for the defendant had been formerly the 
lawyer for the defendant in this suit was no ground for rejecting his testimony. 
(Code of Civil Procedure, sees. 382 and 383.)<br><br></li><li>The denial of the motion of the plaintiff that the testimony of the 
witnesses be taken down in writing was not error. There is no provision of law 
which <em>requires</em> this in civil cases.<br><br></li><li>We have already held (1 Off. Gaz., 45) that it was not necessary to 
incorporate in the bill of exceptions any of the documents presented by the 
plaintiff, and received in evidence without objection, with the exception of 
document No. 14, which does so appear.</li></ol>
<p>No exceptions other than those hereinbefore discussed are mentioned by the 
appellant in his assignment of errors, or anywhere referred to in his brief.</p>
<p>The judgment is affirmed, with the cost of this instance against the 
appellant.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C J., Torres, Cooper, Mapa, McDonough,</em> and <em>Johnson, 
JJ., </em>concur.<br><br></p>
