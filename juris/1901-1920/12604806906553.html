				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE, VS. GERONIMO TORRENTE, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.

				<BR><STRONG>COOPER, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Geronimo Torrente is accused of  the  crime of <em>lesiones graves</em> committed in the following manner:</p>
<p> That the defendant on the afternoon of March 15, 1902, in the city of Manila, maltreated his niece, Jacinta de Leon, a maiden of 17 years of age, by striking her,  kicking  her, and burning her with carbolic acid for not having acceded to his lustful desires.</p>
<p> The defendant pleaded  not guilty.   The trial resulted in a conviction of the  defendant by the lower court of the offense of <em>lesiones  menos graves</em> as defined in article 418 of the Penal Code, and he was sentenced to five months and a day of <em>arresto mayor</em>.</p>
<p> He appeals from this judgment.</p>
<p> The trial of the  case having been fixed for the first of May, 1902, on account of the alleged unavoidable absence of the defendant's  attorney  from the city of Manila, he asked for a suspension of the trial, which was denied him.</p>
<p> The refusal of the trial  court to grant the continuance is assigned as error. This assignment of error is not borne out by the record.   From it, it appears that the case having been called for  trial  the  defendant produced  a telegram from his attorney to the effect that he could not come "on account  of accident   to  boiler."   The  judge thereupon required the  defendant to  employ other counsel, and, the defendant having stated that he was  unable to do so, the court appointed Senor Monroy <em>de  oficio</em>  as his attorney. No objection was made by  the defendant to  proceeding to trial after the assignment  of Senor Monroy as counsel; he acquiesced in the action of the court and proceeded to trial without further objection.</p>
<p> The case appears to have been tried in a proper and skillful manner and   no  essential  right of the accused has been prejudiced.  Besides, no reason is given why the defendant's counsel should have been  absent.  The  case had been continued once before, and the circumstances of the absence of his  attorney were not shown, except  that he was delayed by an accident.</p>
<p> Another objection to the judgment is  that it is contrary to the law and  the evidence, in that it does not appear beyond a. reasonable doubt that the intention of the accused was to commit  the  crime of  which  he was convicted, nor does it appear that the injured party  was incapacitated for a period of eight days or more on account of the injuries received.   This objection requires a review of the evidence.</p>
<p> The testimony of Jacinta de Leon, the injured girl, shows that she was  16  years  old,  and on the 15th day of March lived with her aunt, the defendant's wife; that while she was lying on the bed on the 15th of March, taking a siesta, she was approached by the defendant, who  made an improper proposal to her; that he kissed her, whereupon she arose from the bed and went into the presence of her aunt; that the defendant put on his shoes and went off; after a time she saw  that he was coming toward her and she sat down, whereupon  he struck her; that she said nothing because  she did not know what  wrong she had done.  He again struck her and gave her a kick and said that she must leave the house; that she dressed herself and went off in order that his rage might pass away, and being about to go out the defendant followed her, having in his hand a bottle of acid which he threw in her face; that raising her hand the hand of the defendant was  struck and, a part of the contents was spilled; that she entered the  hospital for treatment of the burns, and was two weeks being cured.</p>
<p> The defendant gives quite a different version of the occurrence. He testifies that he was leaving the house on the evening of the day in question to disinfect a  water-closet, and  had in  his  hand a bottle of  carbolic acid; that the noise he made awoke his wife who asked him  where he was  going, and upon his replying she said that he could not go out  and seized him by the  shoulder; that being unable by her strength to prevent him from leaving the house,  she called to her niece and commanded her to assist her; that in his effort to disengage himself from his wife and the niece, and not recollecting that the bottle had no stopper, the  acid was spilled upon the girl, a part of it falling on himself.  In  this statement the defendant is corroborated by the testimony of his wife.</p>
<p> We are disposed to take the version of the injured girl as true and  to discard entirely the statements of the husband and wife.  The girl's statement shows not only a gross violation of  confidence resulting from  the relationship existing between her and the defendant, but discloses a case  of most brutal and cruel conduct to an unoffending person. There is no conceivable reason why such a charge should have been falsely made by the injured girl; on the contrary, it  appears that  from some influence exercised upon her she very unwillingly appeared in court to testify. She failed to appear at the time  fixed for the trial and it was only through the process of  the  court that her  testimony was secured.  There were strong motives on the part of the defendant to exculpate himself, and there was the natural desire upon the part of the wife to relieve him of his embarrassment.</p>
<p> It is also assigned as error that the court erred in  overruling the defendant's motion for a new trial based  upon the ground of newly discovered evidence.</p>
<p> Attached to the application is the affidavit of Damos de Leon, the father of  the injured  girl, in which he states that Jacinta was not incapacitated  from following her ordinary pursuits and that she recovered within six days from the time she entered the hospital.</p>
<p> Also the affidavit of Doctor Juan Miciano, the attending physician of the hospital of San  Juan de Dios, where the injured girl Avas treated, who states that Jacinta de  Leon entered the hospital on account of burns caused by carbolic acid in the face and on  the right arm,  and that she was cured in nine days from her entrance in  the hospital without any deformity or permanent  physical disability being occasioned, there only remaining  white spots  as the result of the burns.</p>
<p> This last affidavit  sustains the  charge that the injuries were more than eight days in curing, and the testimony of this witness would strengthen  the  case of  the prosecution.   There is  no reason shown why  the  testimony  of Damos  de Leon was not known  before  the trial, and the witness produced at the trial.</p>
<p> The difficulty  has not been so much in reaching a conclusion in view of the conflict in the evidence as in discovering adequate punishment under the present laws for the defendant.</p>
<p> The  offense was of a  most brutal  character, and the punishment which we affix we regard as wholly inadequate to the case.<br>
  <br>
  Article 418  of the Penal Code provides that  injuries which shall render the injured person unable to work for eight days or more, or winch  shall require the care  of a physician for a similar period, shall be punished with <em>arresto mayor</em> or banishment and a fine of from 325 to 3,250 pesetas, in the discretion of the court, and when such injuries shall be  inflicted with  manifest  intent of outrage, or under humiliating circumstances, in addition to <em>arresto mayor</em> a fine of from 325 to 3,250 pesetas may be imposed.</p>
<p> The evidence shows  manifest intent of outrage, and in addition  to this  there were  other circumstances  which should have been taken into  consideration.  The offense was committed with <em>alevosia</em>, and also with abuse of confidence; both of  which are circumstances which aggravate criminal liability.   (Paragraphs 2 and 10, article  10, Penal Code.)</p>
<p> The judgment of the lower  court will be reversed, and judgment is now here entered convicting the defendant of lesioncs menos graves inflicted with the manifest intent of outrage, and with  the attending aggravating circumstances defined in paragraphs 2 and 10 of article 10 of the Penal Code; and he is sentenced to imprisonment of <em>arresto mayor</em> for the period of six months, and to pay a fine of 3,250 pesetas, and in the event of insolvency on the part of the defendant he is sentenced to  subsidiary imprisonment at the rate of one day for every 12 1/2 pesetas of the fine,  such  subsidiary  imprisonment  not to exceed  two months.</p>
<p> Costs of suit are also adjudged against the defendant. So ordered.</p>
<p> <em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa,</em> and <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p> <em>Willard, J.,</em> concurs in the result.</p>
