				<H3>THE MANILA RAILROAD CO., PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. MACONDRAY & CO., DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>STREET, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This action was instituted by the plaintiff, the Manila Railroad Company, 
upon February 24,1916, in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila to 
recover of the defendant, Macondray &amp; Co., the sum of P75,000, the alleged 
value of salvage service rendered on April 6,1915, by the steamer 
<em>Hondagua</em>, owned by the plaintiff, to the steamer <em>Seward</em>, which 
was owned by the defendant. At the hearing judgment was rendered in favor of the 
plaintiff for the sum of P4,000. From this judgment both parties have appealed, 
the plaintiff insisting that the amount allowed by the lower court is 
inadequate, the defendant that it is excessive.
<p>The facts as found by the judge of the trial court are substantially these: 
On the date mentioned the <em>Seward</em> left Saigon for the Philippine 
Islands, encountering a moderately high sea. The ship was laden with a cargo of 
rice, the weight of which, taken in connection with the condition of the sea, 
caused the vessel to spring a leak, and her master felt compelled to return to 
Saigon. At this juncture the steamship <em>Hondagua</em> was sighted, whereupon 
the <em>Seward</em> flew the international code signal "In distress; want 
immediate assistance." The <em>Hondagua</em> changed her course and approached 
the <em>Seward</em> the latter in succession displaying the following signals: 
"I have sprung a leak;" "I wish to be taken in tow;" "Can you spare hawser;" and 
"The leak is gaining rapidly." In response to signals from the <em>Hondagua</em> 
the <em>Seward</em> sent her own boat to the <em>Hondagua</em> for a heaving 
line, by means of which a hawser was passed from the <em>Hondagua</em> to the 
<em>Seward</em> and the former, with the latter in tow, then proceeded at half 
speed towards Saigon. Shortly afterwards, the <em>Seward</em> signalled "The 
leak is gaining rapidly," after which the <em>Hondagua</em> went full speed 
ahead, until the arrival of both vessels at Cape St. James, at the mouth of the 
Saigon River, where they anchored. The towing occupied some four or five hours, 
and covered a distance of twenty five or thirty miles. The <em>Seward's</em> 
engines were kept working until within an hour of her arrival at Cape St. James, 
when the water reached the engine room and put out the fires under the main 
boiler, leaving only the auxiliary boiler in use.</p>
<p>The court further found that the value of the <em>Seward</em> upon her 
arrival at Cape St. James did not exceed P20,000 and that the value of the cargo 
was approximately P54,000. The defendant company had no interest in the cargo, 
other than that of carrier, and the cargo was owned by shippers whose names do 
not appear of record.</p>
<p>There is of course no question as to the liability of the defendant, as owner 
of the <em>Seward</em>, for the service rendered by the plaintiff in towing that 
ship to safety. Nor is there any dispute over the fact that the service rendered 
was a salvage service and remunerable as such. The tow questions properly 
presented for decisions are these: (1) Is the plaintiff entitled to recover from 
the owner of the <em>Seward</em>, in this action, remuneration for saving the 
cargo as well as for saving the ship? (2) What is the reasonable compensation 
which should be allowed in this action?</p>
<p>Where a ship and its cargo are saved together, as a result of services 
carried on with a view to saving both, the salvage allowance should be 
apportioned between the ship and cargo in the proportion of their respective 
values, the same as in a case of general average; and neither is liable for the 
salvage due from the other. (35 Cyc, 770; <em>see also</em> 24 Am. &amp; Eng. 
Encyc. Law, 2d ed., p. 1219, <em>The Alaska</em>, 23 Fed., 597, <em>The Colonel 
Adams</em>, 19 Fed., 795.)</p>
<p>"The salvor must always bear in mind that * * * the interests in ship and in 
cargo are only severally liable. each for its proportionate share of the salvage 
remuneration. If one who has salved both ship and cargo brings before the court 
in his salvage action only the ship, or only the cargo, he will get judgment 
only for such an amount of reward as the court finds to be due in respect of the 
value of that property which is before the court." (Kennedy on Law of Civil 
Salvage, p. 186.)</p>
<p>In the case of <em>The Mary Pleasants</em> (Swab., 224), where salvage 
services had been rendered to the vessel herself and to the cargo aboard of her, 
the salvors proceeded against the ship alone. In the course of his judgment the 
learned Dr. Lushington said: "But the real difficulty is, that there is no 
proceeding against the cargo * * *. The difficulty, I say, arises from this 
circumstance, because when the court considers the services rendered to the ship 
and cargo, it always estimates the amount of salvage remuneration according to 
the value of the ship and cargo taken together. It is contrary to all principles 
of justice, if a cargo has received and been benefited by the services so 
rendered, that the whole burden of the salvage remuneration should fall on the 
ship itself."</p>
<p>Not only is the salvage charge a separate and divisible burden as between 
ship and cargo, but also as between portions of the cargo belonging to different 
owners. Thus, in an appeal by the claimants of the cargo, it was said by the 
Supreme Court of the United States:</p>
<p>"It is true that the salvage service was in one sense entire; but it 
certainly cannot be deemed entire for the purpose of founding a right against 
all the claimants jointly, so as to make them all jointly responsible for the 
whole salvage; on the contrary, each claimant is responsible only for the 
salvage properly due and chargeable on the gross proceeds or sales of his own 
property <em>pro rata</em>. It would otherwise follow that the property of one 
claimant might be made chargeable with the payment of the whole salvage, which 
would be against the clearest principles of law on this subject." (Straton 
<em>vs</em>. Jarvis, 8 Pet. [U. S.], 4; <em>see also</em> Shields <em>vs</em>. 
Thomas, 58 U.S., 3; Spear <em>vs</em>. Place, 11 How., 521.)</p>
<p>These authorities show that there is no common liability for the amounts due 
from the ship or other portions of the cargo when the ship and cargo, or either, 
are brought into the custody of the court as a result of a proceeding <em>in 
rem</em>. The rule of liability must be the same where a personal action is 
instituted against the owners of the one or the other. The personal liability of 
each must be limited to the proportion of the salvage charge which should be 
borne by his own property.</p>
<p>If it had been alleged and proved that the ship was unseaworthy when she put 
to sea or that the necessity for the salvage service was due to the negligence 
of the master, or of the ship's owner, the latter might have been liable, at 
least between himself and the shipper, for the entire cost of the service, and 
this possibly might have changed the character of the ship's liability to the 
salvor; or, again, if the claim for compensation had been limited to the value 
of the service, considered on the simple basis of work and labor done, it would 
have been proper, we think, to assess the entire cost of the service against the 
shipowner, because the service was rendered at the request of the master. But 
when the claim Is put upon the basis of salvage, the fixing of the compensation 
goes beyond the limits of a <em>quantum meruit</em> for the work and labor done 
and involves the assessment of a bounty. The amount to be allowed upon a claim 
of this character is in part determined upon considerations of equity and public 
policy; and it is not proper, in our opinion, to make the ship, or the ship's 
owner, liable for the whole, in the absence of some statutory provision, or 
other positive rule of law, fixing such liability on the shipowner. It results 
that, as the owner of the cargo has not been made a party, no recovery can be 
had in this action in regard to the service rendered to the cargo.</p>
<p>In fixing the amount of compensation to be awarded for salvage service, it 
has been declared by the Supreme Court of the United States that the principal 
circumstances to be taken into consideration are: (1) The labor expended by the 
salvors in rendering the salvage service; (2) The promptitude, skill, and energy 
displayed in rendering the service and saving the property; (3) The value of the 
property employed by the salvors in rendering the service, and the danger to 
which such property was exposed; (4) The risk incurred by the salvors in 
rescuing the property from the impending peril; (5) The value of the property 
salved; and (6) The degree of danger from which the property was rescued. 
(<em>The Blackwall</em>, 10 Wall., 1; 19 L. ed., 870.)</p>
<p>In applying these criteria to the case now before us, the following 
circumstances, not already noted, are pertinent, namely: the <em>Hondagua</em> 
was delayed in her voyage about nine hours, during five of which she was engaged 
in towing the <em>Seward</em>. This delay caused her to enter at Iloilo, the 
port of her destination, in the early hours of the morning of the day of her 
arrival instead of the late afternoon of the previous day; but the unloading of 
her cargo was not thereby retarded. Considered on the basis of charter-party 
contract under which she was operating, the <em>Hondagua</em> was earning about 
P300 per day, which was considered reasonable compensation for her use, 
including the services of officers and crew. The service rendered did not 
involve any further expenditure of labor on the part of the salvors than such as 
was commonly incident to working the ship. No unusual display of skill and 
energy on their part was required; and the condition of the sea was not such as 
to involve any special risk either to the <em>Hondagua</em> or her crew. 
Finally, the danger from which the <em>Seward</em> was rescued was real, as the 
ship when taken in tow was confronted by a serious peril. The value of the 
vessel when saved was, we think, properly fixed by the trial court at 
P20,000.</p>
<p>In determining the amount of the award to be allowed in cases of this kind 
the aim should be to hold out to seafaring men a fair inducement to the 
performance of salvage services without fixing a scale of compensation so high 
as to cause vessels in need of such services to hesitate and decline to receive 
them because of the ruinous cost. That the salvor is entitled, as of bounty, to 
something more than mere remuneration for his own work and the risk incurred by 
him, is conceded; but certainly the interests of commerce would not be promoted 
by the encouragement of exorbitant charges. Towage is not considered a salvage 
service of high order of merit; and when the risk is inconsiderable and other 
conditions favorable, the compensation to be allowed should be modest in its 
amount. Under all the circumstances we think that the sum of P1,000 is adequate 
for the service rendered in this case. The judgment of the lower court must 
accordingly be reduced to the sum of one thousand pesos (P1,000), with interest 
at 6 per cent per annum from February 24, 1916, and for this amount execution 
will issue. No special finding will be made as to costs of this instance.</p>
<p>With the modification above indicated the judgment is affirmed. So 
ordered.</p>
