				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>These defendants were charged with aiding and abetting a band of brigands in violation of the provisions of section 4 of Act No. 518 of the Philippine Commission, as amended by Act No. 1121.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the trial of the cause Pascual de los Santos was dismissed in order that he might be used as a witness  on behalf of the Government in accordance  with the provisions of section 34 of General Orders, No. 58.</p>
<p>At the conclusion  of the trial the court found that there was not sufficient evidence to sustain the charges against Benito Poblete and therefore dismissed him.</p>
<p>After a consideration of the evidence adduced during the said cause the lower court found that Victoriano Poblete and Mariano Borromeo were guilty of the crime charged and sentenced Victoriano Poblete to be imprisoned for a period of fifteen years at hard labor and Mariano Borromeo to be imprisoned for a period of ten years at hard labor and to pay the costs.   From this decision the defendants appealed to this court.</p>
<p>An examination by this court of the evidence adduced in said cause during the  trial in the lower court fails to disclose  sufficient  proof to show  that Mariano Borromeo in any way violated the said provisions of section 4 of Act No.  518.  The  judgment of the lower court  as to him is therefore reversed.</p>
<p>The evidence adduced during the triad of said cause in the lower court shows beyond peradventure of doubt  that during the years 1902, 1903, ancl 1904 there existed a band of brigands composed of more than three persons, armed with guns, revolvers, and bolos, in the Province of Albay, organized for the purpose of roaming over the country and stealing  carabaos and other  personal property,  and  that the chief of the said band was one Agustin Saria.   The evidence further discloses that the existence  of this band during said years in said province was notorious; that  said band had had several encounters with the Constabulary in said  province prior  to  the  time  when the defendant is alleged to have given said Agustin Saria food, etc.</p>
<p>Said section 4 of Act No. 518 does not attempt to punish one who aids and abets a band of brigands by giving them food, etc., unless such aiding and abetting is given to such band knowing at the time  that the band is  a band  of brigands; in other words, the furnishing of food, etc., to a band of brigands is  not necessarily punishable by  law. The  person rendering such  assistance  to  a  band of this character must know at the time such assistance  is rendered that the band  is a band of brigands.   (U. S. vs. Francisco Martinez Montero,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> case 2316, decided April 25,  1906; U. S. vs. Francisco  Balbas et al.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> (5 Off.  Gaz., 71)  ; U. S. vs. Apolonio Aytona,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> August 3, 1906 (4 Off. Gaz., 742).</p>
<p>In the present  case, however,  the evidence discloses the fact, beyond peradventure  of doubt, that the  defendant Victoriano Poblete gave to Agustin Sari a, chief of the said band, food, consisting of rice, etc., with the full knowledge that the said  Agustin Saria was the leader  of a band  of brigands existing in the Province of Albay, and therefore violated section 4 of Act No. 518.</p>
<p>Taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances surrounding the acts  of the defendant in aiding and abetting said band, we are  of the opinion  that the sentence imposed by the lower court should be reduced and that the defendant should be punished with the minimum penalty prescribed  by  said section 4 of Act No.  518, which is ten years.</p>
<p>With this modification, the judgment  of the lower court with reference to the said Victoriano  Poblete is hereby affirmed and the  defendant Victoriano  Poblete is hereby sentenced to be imprisoned for a period of ten  years, and to pay the costs.</p>
<p>After the expiration of ten days let judgment be entered in accordance  herewith and ten  days thereafter the cause remanded to the  lower  court for proper procedure.   So ordered.</p>
