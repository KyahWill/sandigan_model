				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an action to recover P1,915.30 damages alleged to have been caused by 
the negligence of the defendant in handling the plaintiffs' baggage, whereby it 
fell into the sea and was injured or destroyed.
<p>The plaintiffs were passengers on the steamer <em>St. Albans,</em> which, at 
the time herein complained of, was the property of the defendant corporation and 
was engaged in carrying freight and passengers between Shanghai, China, and 
Manila, Philippine Islands. It arrived in Manila on the morning of the 7th of 
January, 1913. Shortly after its arrival plaintiffs' baggage was taken out of 
the hold of the ship for the purpose of being placed on the dock alongside of 
which the vessel was berthed. The baggage was placed in a sling, consisting of a 
single rope wound once around the trunks, and was swung from the side of the 
vessel. While still several feet above the wharf, the employee of the defendant 
company who was operating the winch, by some act or other, permitted the baggage 
to drop with great rapidity. In its passage downward it struck the side of the 
ship with such force as to release it from the sling and it dropped into the 
water alongside of the ship. The damages are stipulated at P1,188.</p>
<p>The defendant, while admitting the damage caused to plaintiffs’ baggage, 
denied that it was the result of the company's negligence and set up as a 
special defense the limitation of liability established by the contract under 
which the defendant undertook to transport the plaintiffs from the city of 
Hongkong to Manila.</p>
<p>The record shows that on or about the end of December, 1912, the plaintiffs 
bought of the defendant's agent in Shanghai two first-class tickets for Manila, 
which entitled them to travel from Hongkong to Manila by the defendant's 
steamship <em>St. Albans.</em> The tickets delivered to them were in English, 
which language plaintiffs read with ease and understand perfectly, and bore on 
their face, in large print, a statement that they were issued subject to the 
conditions printed on the back. One of these conditions, printed in legible 
type, was as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This ticket is issued by the company and accepted by the passenger subject 
to the following conditions:</p>
<p>"The company will not hold itself responsible for any loss or damage 
passengers may sustain from the following causes: Prom advance in or delays 
after advertised date of sailing, either through the performance of His 
Majesty's mail service or any other cause, from detention on the voyage, or at 
any of the intermediate ports, or through steamers not meeting, or delays from 
accident, from perils of the sea, or from machinery, boilers or steam, or from 
any act, neglect or default whatsoever of the pilot, masters, or mariners, nor 
from any consequences arising from any sanitary regulations or precautions which 
the company's officers or local government authorities may deem necessary. </p>
<p><em>"Personal baggage.</em>—In order to insure as far as possible the safe 
custody of luggage, passengers should personally see their luggage delivered on 
board. Each adult saloon passenger may carry, free of charge, but at his own 
risk, 20 cubic feet of luggage; and each steerage passenger 10 cubic feet, under 
similar conditions (all in excess of these quantities must be paid for at the 
current rate of freight); but the company will not hold itself responsible for 
any loss, or damage to or detention, or overcarriage of luggage, under any 
circumstances whatsoever unless it has been booked and paid for as 
freight."</p></blockquote>
<p>At the time the tickets were delivered to plaintiffs in Shanghai their 
attention was not especially drawn to the provisions on the back of the ticket. 
The plaintiffs put their baggage on the <em>St. Albans</em> without paying for 
its transportation as freight and traveled with such baggage to Manila.</p>
<p>The trial court's finding as to the negligence of defendant is based 
particularly on the testimony of J. S. Stanley, Deputy Collector of Customs, and 
I. V. Chapman, chief wharfinger in charge of pier No. 5.</p>
<p>Mr. Stanley testified: "While standing at the extreme end of Pier No. 5, I 
witnessed a number of trunks being lifted from the deck of the steamship St. 
Albans to an elevation of about 10 or 12 feet from the deck and practically the 
same height above the pier. The winchman was instructed to let go. The sling 
dropped suddenly and was not checked at the proper time, and the sling of trunks 
struck the side of the wharf, with the result that the trunks were forced from 
the sling and fell into the water. It is customary to use a rope sling or a 
cargo chute running from the deck to the pier. The slings vary in size but are 
sufficiently large to contain a large number of trunks and are formed of ropes 
running in opposite directions forming a rope net. If these trunks had been in n 
rope sling they would not have fallen in the water."</p>
<p>Mr. Chapman testified: "When the steamship St. Albans came alongside the pier 
I took all her lines and berthed her in a position for the gangway and hatchways 
to work. Immediately after the ship was made fast I requested to be informed 
from the chief officer where the baggage would be discharged from; he told me 
hatch No. 4; I went to No. 4 hatch and asked the second officer who was there in 
charge of the hatch where the baggage was to be discharged from; he said, 'Right 
here indicating No. 4 hatch. I then told him I would have a chute there for him 
right away and he answered: 'All right.' I immediately went into the pier and 
ordered one of the foremen and the men to take a chute to No. 4 hatch. I was 
following with the foreman and behind the chute when Mr. Stanley informed me 
that the baggage was over the side. The chute at this time was just through the 
door about 75 feet from the hatch. On arriving there I saw that the sling and 
these trunks were all lying in the water. The stevedore had a lot of his men 
over the side picking up the trunks with the men from the pier helping."</p>
<p>It is the contention of the defendant company that it is exempt from 
liability by virtue of the contract appearing on the tickets already referred to 
and quoted; as that contract was valid in the place where made, namely, the 
Colony of Hongkong, and that that being the case, it will be enforced according 
to its terms in the Philippine Islands. It is also urged that it was not 
necessary specifically to direct the attention of the passengers to the 
stipulations on the back of the ticket introduced in evidence.</p>
<p>The evidence relative to the law governing these contracts in Hongkong 
consists of the testimony of a Hongkong barrister, learned in the law of England 
and her colonies, and is to the effect that, under the law in force at the place 
where the contract was made, the contract was valid and enforceable, and that it 
is not necessary that the attention of persons purchasing tickets from common 
carriers be drawn specially to the terms thereof when printed upon a ticket 
which on its face shows that it is issued subject to such conditions. The 
barrister also testified that under the law of England and her colonies 
everything was done which was necessary to make the terms printed on the back of 
the tickets a part of the contract between the parties.</p>
<p>It is our conclusion that the judgment must be affirmed.<br><br>It is 
undoubted that the contract found upon the back of the tickets is a contract 
perfectly valid in England and her colonies and one which would be enforced 
according to its terms in British jurisdictions. The question is what were its 
terms? It will be remembered that the contract provides "the company will not 
hold itself responsible for any loss, or damage to or detention, or overcarriage 
of luggage, under any circumstances whatsoever, unless it has been booked and 
paid for as freight." Ordinarily this language would seem to be broad enough to 
cover every possible contingency, including the negligent act of defendant's 
servant. To so hold, however, would run counter to the established law of 
England and the United States on that subject. In the case of Price and 
Company<em> vs.</em> Union Lighterage Company (King's Bench Division, 1903, Vol. 
1, pp. 750, 754), the court said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"An exemption in general words not expressly relating to negligence, even 
though the words are wide enough to include loss by negligence or default of 
carriers' servants, must be construed as limiting the liability of the carrier 
as assurer, and not as relieving him from the duty of exercising reasonable 
skill and care."</p></blockquote>
<p>The result of this decision seems to be that unless the contract of exemption 
specifically refers to exemption for <em>negligence</em>, it will be construed 
as simply exempting the carrier from his liability as insurer, in other words, 
from his common law liability as carrier. This decision of the King's Bench 
Division is supported by many authorities and apparently has never been 
questioned. Among other references made in that case is that of Compania de 
Navegaci6n La Flecha <em>vs.</em> Brauer (168 U. S., 104), in which the opinion 
was rendered by Mr. Justice Gray, who reviews with great thoroughness and 
erudition both the English and American authorities, many of which contain 
exemptions quite as comprehensive as those contained in the condition under 
which plaintiffs' baggage was accepted by the defendant in this case, such as 
that the baggage "was to be carried at the risk of the owner" and that the 
"carrier is not to be responsible for any loss under any circumstances 
whatsoever." (See also Wheeler <em>vs.</em> 0. S, N. Co., 125 N. Y., 155; 
Nicholas <em>vs.</em> N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. R. Co., 89 N. Y., 370.)</p>
<p>The reasonableness of the strict rule of construction that the courts of 
England and of the State of New York apply to contracts restricting the 
liability of carriers with respect to their negligence is apparent when one 
considers that such contracts are held to be contrary to public policy and 
invalid in the Federal courts and in most of the State courts of the Union. (The 
Kensington, 183 U. S., 263.)</p>
<p>In this connection, it may not be amiss to state that a critical examination 
of the deposition of Mr, Ernest Hamilton Sharpe, Master of Arts and Bachelor of 
Civil Law of the University of Oxford, Barrister at Law of London, Shanghai and 
Hongkong, and King's Counsel at the latter colony, does not disclose anything 
contradictory to the rule just stated. Mr. Sharpens examination was confined to 
the question of the validity of the contract indorsed upon plaintiffs' ticket 
exempting the defendant company from liability for damage to their baggage. In 
view of the accurate answers of the learned witness to the questions put to him 
as to the validity of the condition in question under English law, there is no 
reason to suppose that he would not have stated correctly the rule as to the 
construction of the condition had his attention been directed to that point. In 
any event, this court is not, by reason of the opinion expressed by an expert 
witness, precluded from advising itself as to the common law of England. (Sec. 
302, Code of Civil Procedure.)</p>
<p>The judgment is affirmed, with costs against the appellant.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Carson,</em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p>
