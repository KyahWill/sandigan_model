				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The defendants have  been convicted of rebellion, under section 3 of Act No. 292 of the Commission.  The information is  very  loosely drawn, but we  think it  sufficiently charges the crime of insurrection or rebellion.   It so designates the crime charged, and it contains language which may fairly be construed as an allegation that the defendants incited and  set on  foot a rebellion against the authority of  the United States  in  the Philippine  Islands, which is  the definition of the crime  given by the statute. If the information could be regarded as defective in not stating facts which constitute  the crime of rebellion, yet, as it specifically designates that crime as the one charged, and as we think the evidence shows the commission of that crime, and as no  objection was taken to the information either in the court below or in this court, we are of opinion that the conviction should be sustained.</p>
<p>Taking the admissions made by the defendants at the trial in connection with the documentary evidence  introduced by the prosecution, it is clearly shown that on July 5, 1902, the  day of the defendants' arrest, they were members of the society known as the Katipunan,  as reconstituted by them and others in December, 1901; that this society had for its object the forcible overthrow of the Government of the United  States in the Philippine Islands; that it had established what  purported to be a  Tagalog government of the Archipelago, of which government the  defendants were high officials; that it had organized what purported to be an army; and that  during a period extending  from December, 1901, down to a date subsequent to May 1, 1902, its leaders, including the defendants, were actively engaged •in plotting and   organizing insurrectionary  movements. These facts are sufficient to support the conviction.</p>
<p>The appellants  claimed at the trial that they could not be convicted of the crime of rebellion, because they had never recognized the Government  of the United States in these Islands, or  taken  the oath  of allegiance thereto. Their counsel  in this court has not insisted upon this defense, and it is so  palpably unfounded—being nothing less than a negation of the right of the Government to maintain its existence and authority against a certain class of the population—that we do not think it necessary to discuss it.</p>
<p>The only question raised by counsel in this court is as to the sentence.  The crime  is punishable by imprisonment for not more than ten years and a fine of not more than $10,000.  (Act No. 292, sec. 3.)   The court imposed a fine of $5,000 and  the maximum of the penalty of imprisonment, without,  however, finding the existence of any aggravating circumstance.   It is claimed that the penalty of imprisonment fixed for the crime must be divided into grades, and,.in the absence of either aggravating or extenuating circumstances, should be applied in the present case in the medium grade, in accordance with the rules of the Spanish Penal Code.</p>
<p>We are of opinion that the rules of the Penal Code  with reference to  the  circumstances which aggravate and extenuate guilt, and with reference to  the application of penalties as affected  by the existence or nonexistence of such circumstances, are not applicable to the penal legislation of the  Commission.  Those rules form a part  of a complicated and carefully adjusted system  of penalties, and can not  be  conveniently applied, and in many cases can not be applied at all, except in relation with other parts of such system.  They are entirely foreign  to the spirit of American criminal legislation, which allows wide discretion to  the judge  in the fixing of penalties.  In the absence of anything in Act No.  292 to indicate that the Commission intended  that the penalties therein prescribed should be applied by the courts in accordance with the rules of the Penal Code, we can not presume that such was their  intention.</p>
<p>The discretion possessed by the judge as to the penalty was, we think, in the present case, properly exercised. Application was made by the  defendants in the court below for the benefits of the amnesty proclamation of July 4, 1902.  Counsel  in this court has not renewed this application.  The defendants are not within the  terms of the amnesty proclamation, because the crime of which they have been convicted was committed subsequent to  May 1, 1902.</p>
<p>The judgment of the court below is affirmed, and the cause  will be returned to that court for  the execution of such judgment.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Cooper,  Willard,</em> and M<em>apa, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
