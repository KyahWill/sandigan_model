				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Upon the evidence in  the case, the  defendants can be convicted of the  crime of brigandage only by taking into consideration certain confessions made by them to officers and soldiers of the Constabulary.</p>
<p>Act No.  619, section 4, provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"SEC. 4.  No confession of any person  charged with crime shall be received as evidence against him  by  any court of justice unless it  be  first  shown to the  satisfaction of the court that it  was freely and  voluntarily  made and  not the result of violence, intimidation, threat,.menace, or of promises or offers of reward or leniency."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was no  showing made in  the court  below as to whether the confessions were  voluntarily made or not. The judge should not, therefore, have considered them.   It is suggested that the defendants,  not having objected to their admission, tacitly waived compliance with these statutory provisions.   There  Is force in this suggestion.  But, whatever may be said of  acquiescence by failure to object in other cases, in this special case the  dispositions of the positive law are so strongly stated that we can not hold that they ran be ignored on account of the simple silence of the defendants.   The result is that a new trial must be ordered, at which  the fiscal  will have an opportunity of complying with this law.</p>
<p>The Solicitor-General has asked that the defendants be acquitted of the charge  of brigandage and prosecuted for rebellion or insurrection.  If the  said  confessions  were voluntarily made, we think that there is sufficient evidence in the case to convict the defendants of brigandage.  However, after the case is remanded it will be in the power of the fiscal, with the consent  of the court, to dismiss the present complaint  and present another one for the crime suggested by the Solicitor-General.</p>
<p>We feel constrained to add that, in many cases coming from this province for the crime of brigandage, it seems to have been the opinion of the prosecuting officer that he made  out a case by simply showing  that  the defendants belonged to a band that carried arms, without showing to what purposes  the band  was devoted.   This  is not sufficient.  (United States vs. Saturnino de la Cruz, decided Aug. 21, 1903).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p>
<p>The judgment is set aside, and the case  is remanded to the court below  for a new  trial, with costs of this instance <em>de oficio</em>.</p>
