  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The decision in this case was announced on the 28th of April, 1906.  The grounds of that decision are as follows:</p>
<p>The plaintiff brought this action upon a promissory note, payment of which was  guaranteed in writing by the defendant. A copy of the note, with the  written  guaranty thereon, was attached to the complaint.   The guaranty is signed:  "For the International Banking Corporation,  R. W.  Brown."</p>
<p>The defendant in its answer denied generally the allegations in the complaint.   It alleged that the defendant could not, under  its charter, enter into the contract of  guaranty alleged in the complaint. It alleged further that no agent or officer of the defendant was authorized to enter into the contract of guaranty alleged in the complaint. It further alleged that R.W. Brown was not authorized to enter into this contract of guaranty on behalf of the defendant.  This answer was not sworn to.</p>
<p>At the trial the plaintiff introduced  in evidence  the promissory note, with the written  guaranty thereon, and the notarial protest, and thereupon rested.</p>
<p>The defendant introduced ho evidence.</p>
<p>Judgment was entered in favor of  the plaintiff,  based upon section 103 of the Code of Civil Procedure.  That section is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"SEC. 103. Actions and defenses  based  upon written instruments.â€”When an action is  brought upon a written instrument, and  the complaint contains or  has annexed a copy of such instrument, the genuineness and due execution of the instrument shall be deemed admitted,  unless specifically denied under oath in its  answer; and when  the defense to a.n action, or a counterclaim stated in an answer, is founded upon a written instrument and the copy thereof is contained in or annexed to the answer, the genuineness and due execution of such instrument shall be deemed admitted, unless specifically denied under oath by the plaintiff in his pleadings."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The failure of the defendant to deny the genuineness and due execution of this guaranty under oath was  an admission,  not only of the signature of Brown, but also of his authority to make the contract in behalf of the  defendant and of the power of the defendant to  enter into such a contract.   (Bailsman <em>vs</em>. Credit Guaranty Co.,  47 Minn., 377; explained in McCormick Harvester Co. <em>vs</em>. Doucette, 61 Minn., 40; Knight <em>vs</em>. Whitmore, 125 Cal., 198.)</p>
<p>Nothing to the contrary of this doctrine was decided by this court  in the case  of Vicente Nery Lim-Chingco <em>vs</em>. Crisanta Terariray<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> (3 Off. Gaz., 687.)</p>
