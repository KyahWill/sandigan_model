				<H3>AGUSTINA RAFOLS, PETITIONER AND APPELLANT, VS. EMILIA RAFOLS ET AL., OPPONENTS AND APPELLEES.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Agustina  Rafols, of the city of  Cebu,  Island  of  Cebu, applied  for  the entry in  the new land registry, and for the ownership title, of an improved urban property consisting of a lot,  a house of masonry,  a warehouse,  and another house of strong materials, whose possession thereof is recorded in the books of the old registry.</p>
<p>Emilia  Rafols,  Arcadia Rafols, and Angela Rafols, as heirs  designated  in  her  will by  their collateral  relative, Luisa Rafols,  who was the original owner of the said property,  opposed the application for the registration of the same, made by Agustina  Rafols.</p>
<p>The following facts were proved:</p>
<ol>
  <li> That Luisa Rafols was  the owner of the said property.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> That, on June 25, 1869, by a public instrument, Luisa Rafols sold the said land and its  improvements, under a paeto de retracto, or agreement of sale with right to repurchase, to the commercial  firm of Koch &amp; Brunner  (Otto Koch and George Brunner), doing business  in the city of Cebu, for the price of 4,600  pesos, it being stipulated, to quote literally:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p>"That the said Dona Luisa may redeem the house and the other buildings sold, with their lots, after the lapse of four years counted from this date, that is, June  24, 1893, and for the same sum of 4,600 pesos, and if,  on  the said date, she does not redeem the  said property, by this mere fact the sale shall be converted into an actual and  perpetual sale, without the need of a new instrument."   (Applicant's Exhibit I, 188.)</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
  <li> That, by another public instrument of June 12,  1893, the term for the maturity of the said <em>pacto de retracto</em> was extended, in the following language:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p>"And the term being about to expire during which Dona Luisa may redeem the property sold by virtue of the stipulated agreement, and  as  she has  not the necessary sum wherewith so to do, she states that from the 24th of the present month the said property shall be considered as sold to Messrs. Koch and Brunner,  until the 24th of June, 1897, under the same  conditions and agreement  as  it Is now sold,  and she  adds that, for the purpose of enabling her to carry the instrument of sale and repurchase into effect before the last date above mentioned, she as the redeemer shall  return,  in addition to the price of  4,600 pesos, the expenses of the present instrument; and  if she  should let the said  term elapse without redeeming the  property, the sale shall be  definitely consummated in favor of the purchasers, in which case it shall be sufficient  merely to record this fact in the registry  by means of a  marginal note." (Applicant's Exhibit I,196.)</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
  <li> That, on July 22,  1894, the said Dona Luisa Rafols solemnly executed her will before the notary public of the district  of  Cebu, wherein she declared that she had  no forced heirs and she named as  her heirs various  collateral relatives (who apparently are seventeen in number at the present time), among them the three opponents, and she appointed  as  her  testamentary  executors  Ignacio  Neis, Francisco Medalle, and Marcos  Alo, whom she vested with the powers of expert partitioners of her  estate and the extensions of time granted  by  law, for  the  fulfillment of the duties  of their office; that,  as guardian for her minor heirs, if any, she appointed Martin Medalle, to serve without bond, and as <em>protutor</em>, Gregorio Cabrera; and she forbade all judicial intervention in the matter  of her said will. (Applicant's Exhibit D, 184.)<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> That, at the death of the testatrix, there was no other minor heir than Felix Rafols,  for whose guardianship  a family council was held before  the justice of the peace of Cebu, on November 20,  1894, whereby the  following resolutions were  adopted:  (a) To  grant  to the  guardian the authorization he solicited  by motion  of the  testamentary executors of  the deceased  Dona Luisa,  to enable him to proceed to the sale "of the right which belonged to the said Dona  Luisa to recover  a house built of strong  materials with a tile roof, together with a masonry warehouse, sold under <em>pacto de retro</em>  to Messrs. Koch and Brunner;" the council, upon granting the authorization requested, provided that the sale should be by public auction, after appraisal by  experts, and  the  latter appraised  the  property at 10,000 pesos.  The auction was announced by the Court of First Instance,  on February 15,  1895, on  a  basis  of 10,000 pesos.   (B,  of e., pp. 10, 11);  (b) to grant a new authorization  to  the guardian  in order  that, in  view  of the failure of the auction, he might proceed  to a new appraisal of the property, which  was valued anew  at  5,000 pesos; (c)  to grant a more  ample authorization to enable the selling, jointly  with the said property,  of other  properties of  the estate, such as a house of strong  materials for 300 pesos, another with a nipa roof for 50 pesos, several parcels  of  agricultural  land,  and a mill  for about 800 pesos—all of which in no wise concerns the present case. This authorization was given on March 30, 1895.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> That neither could this auction be held, on  account of the opposition offered  by the administrator of the convent of  the Santo Nino  of Cebu, to whom the  land  belonged, an  ownership proved  both by the  documents he exhibited and by the recognition and payment of a canon or fee, sometimes by Dona Luisa, sometimes by  Messrs. Koch and Brunner, for the use of  the land; and it was for this reason that the testamentary executors  came to an agreement with the said administrator of the Santo Niño Convent, for the purchase of the lot for the price of 1,100 pesos and for the execution of the instrument of sale by the aforementioned proprietor in behalf  of the  estate  at such time as the repurchase of the property in question should be  effected.  By virtue  of  these stipulations, there  was adopted, as in the previous cases, another resolution by the family council, on June 25, 1895;  (d) granting special authorization to the <i> protutor  </i>to  enable him  to  give his consent to the  aforesaid contract  (pp. 143 to 146; applicant's  Exhibit  L, 99 to 146); and<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> That, by virtue of this authorization and of the agreement had with  the owner  of the lot, the auction was newly announced for  July 9, 1895, in conformity with the order of the Court of First Instance directing  the announcement of the same, issued on the 2d of the said month and, as therein stated, upon the written motion,  made the day before, the  1st, by the testamentary executors.   (Applicant's Exhibit F.  B. of e., pp. 12 and 13.)</li>
</ol>
<p>That this  third auction  took place,  is also  a  fact proven by the testimony of the applicant's two witnesses, Ignacio Neis, the testamentary executor, and Lazaro Osmeña, the highest bidder  for  the property at the  said auction,  and by that of the three witnesses for the opponents, Eduardo Lopez,  Emilia Rafols, and Arcadia Rafols.</p>
<p>Neis and Osmeña both testified that a third auction was held and,  more positively, Osmeña,  who was the  bidder thereat; the latter stated that he had bid in the property, so sold,  at the price of 6,482 pesos—6,100 pesos for the larger and 322  pesos  for the  smaller  house—and that delivery was made of 4,640 pesos to Koch &amp; Brunner, who delivered to Osmeña the instruments relative to the sale under  <em>pacto de retro.</em></p>
<p>Of the opponents' witnesses, Eduardo Lopez  positively testified that there was a first, a second and a third auction, the first two  of  which were  ineffective and  the last was protested as null and void because of an excessive  reduction of the price, which is  equivalent  to saying that  it was actually  held.  This witness added that one of the auction sales, he believed it was the third, must  have taken place in March or April,  1895, and that the second of the auction notices (Applicant's Exhibit  F) was that of the second auction.</p>
<p>Emilia Rafols, opponent, testified  that the property in question was  owned by Agustina Rafols, "because they redeemed it from Koch &amp; Brunner," this witness learned from Brunner, and that the only claim which she had made was that which was apparently still pending relative to the executor's accounts, "accounts of what has taken place, whether  they have  sold the property,  whether there  is any surplus, and whether more property remains, for they have not made any report to us."</p>
<p>Arcadia Rafols, opponent, testified that when she arrived at Cebu she was informed that there had been an auction and the property had been transferred to Tomas Osmena, the husband of Agustina  Rafols.  The  only person who stated  that there had  been an auction with bidding and award, was Jose Felix Martinez, justice of the peace, then acting  as a judge of the Court of First Instance.</p>
<p>In the Court of  First Instance of  Cebu there  is at the present time pending a special action, instituted by Emilia Rafols, one of the opponents, in re the estate of Dona Luisa                  Rafols, registered under No. 183, from which the following documentary evidence was taken:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Temporary receipt—For pfs 4640—Cebu, July 22, 1895. Received from Don Tomas Osmena the  sum of four thousand six hundred and  forty  pesos.—(Signed.)  Koch &amp; Brunner."   (Applicant's Exhibit  H, 187.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From these facts the  following considerations arise:</p>
<p>First. That  if, six years prior to her  decease, Luisa Rafols  sold the property in question to Koch &amp; Brunner, then at the time of her death the house was no longer hers and could not figure among her hereditary assets or in the estate she left  when she  died; such  property  was not a part of her estate, but only the right to repurchase it, valid until June 24, 1897, $nd,  also, this only it was that her heirs could  inherit; from which it is concluded that it may in no  wise be affirmed that the building or the  land belonged to the heirs of Luisa Rafols, for that very reason, to wit, that at  the  latter's death neither of them longer belonged  to  her, nor is  there any  provision whatever in Luisa Rafols' will, with  respect to such  building or to the land, neither of which is  even mentioned  therein.</p>
<p>Second. That the  4,600  pesos received by Luisa Rafols from Koch  &amp; Brunner were '^he price of the sale of the property, and,  at the former's death represented no  debt of any kind of which mention should be made in the will; Luisa  Rafols did not receive them as  a  loan  under the security of a mortgage on her property; had she done so, it might rightly have been said that they were a debt  that she left to her heirs.  After the consummation of that sale, there remained no debt owing by the vendor to the vendees and  nothing that might be construed as  an obligation  was transmitted  to her heirs; what remained  to the vendor and was transmitted to her heirs,  was a right: that of repurchasing the property.</p>
<p>Third. That the title to the said  property, whereby it was  transferred  from Koch &amp; Brunner to Agustina Rafols, was  one acquired by purchase at a judicial public sale for 6,432 pesos;  and although the  record no longer  exists of such transaction, owing to the loss by fire of the records of the Court of First Instance of Cebu, documentary and parol evidence was presented  at the trial to the effect that there were three auctions held for the.sale of the said property, and that evidence is amply sufficient.   The proofs of the first and the second auctions are the minutes of the family council which dealt with the minor Felix Rafols and which is referred to  in  paragraph 5 of this decision, and the applicant's Exhibit E, consisting of the judicial decree of February, 1895, giving notice of the first auction,  as documentary evidence, and the testimony of the opponents' witness, Eduardo Lopez; but the judicial decree, applicant's Exhibit F, is not, as  the latter witness  declared,  proof of the second  auction, for the  guardian could hardly have reported to the family council, on June  22, 1895, that the second auction could not be carried out  on account of the opposition offered by the Santo Niño Convent of Cebu and the council  have  authorized a third auction, according to its minutes  of June 25 of the  same year, if only on July 2, 1895, the date of  that judicial decree, a second auction was announced,  which was the subject of the  applicant's said Exhibit F.   The truth is that the judicial decree contained in this Exhibit  F was published  to announce a  third auction, which, as stated in the decree, was to take place on the 9th of  the said month  and year.</p>
<p>Fourth. That if, as  positively stated by  Eduardo Lopez, a witness for the opponents, there was a third auction; if, as the opponent Arcadia Rafols testified, she was informed when she arrived at Cebu  that there had been  an auction held and that the property had  been conveyed to Tomas Osmeña, the husband  of Agustina Rafols; if,  as testified by Emilia Rafols, the principal opponent, Brunner, of the firm of Koch and Brunner, had told her that the said  spouses Osmeña had redeemed the property, and there  appears in the special  proceedings,  initiated by her, a temporary receipt given by Koch and Brunner for the 4,640 pesos involved in the repurchase, said witness adding that the object  of the special proceedings was to have "the testamentary executors render accounts of what had taken place, whether they had sold the property, whether there was any surplus, and, besides, whether more property remained," then, it is evident that Agustina Rafols acquired the property in question  at  a  public  sale by auction, and  this is what it  is endeavored to prove.</p>
<p>Fifth. That it is not admissible to affirm that the requisites of the auction sale were not complied with, when it is not stated which of them is lacking, especially when the presumption "that the law has been obeyed" is a presumption  of law  (Code of Civ. Pro., subsec.  31, sec. 334);  it must, therefore, be presumed that approval was had of the auction,  if such be the requisite that appears to be lacking; moreover, under the  Civil Code,  which was in full force in 1895 (without having been  suspended in this respect,  as erroneously believed  by a witness),  it was not necessary that either the auction sale or its approval should be judicial acts, inasmuch as it devolved upon the family council to authorize and approve the sale, in accordance with articles 269, cases 5 and  7, and 272 of the said code; so that, there being no reason for the  Court  of First  Instance now to approve that sale held in  1895, it would not be just to subject to such a requisite, not prescribed by law, the exercise of an absolute and unconditional right,  now a vested one, which the  applicant  has  to regard herself as  the selling-owner of the property since  1895, when she  acquired  it, and since which  time she has been holding it without the least  opposition or difficulty, until October 11, 1907, the date of her application whereby alone these questions have been raised; nor would it likewise be just to make dependent on the rendition  and approval of the accounts of the testamentary executor, Ignacio Neis, nor on any other liability of the executorship of the estate of Luisa Rafols, the registration of the property in  question, which latter, in no case and for no reason whatever may be  affected by liabilities of any kind of the said estate, because,  even prior to the testamentary execution, and by an act inter vivos not impugned nor attempted to  be impugned,  the said property ceased  to  belong to the  predecessor  in interest  of  the estate.</p>
<p>Sixth. That, even  supposing for a  moment that there had been no third auction, and that the applicant had not acquired the property by means of this title of acquisition, yet there would always remain the fact, hereinabove stated, shown by the record to have been fully proved, to wit, that on July 22, 1895, Koch &amp; Brunner, the owners of the property at that time, had received from Tomas Osmena, the husband of Agustina Rafols, the 4,640 pesos, the price of the sale of the said property to these spouses, or the price for which  the latter "had  redeemed it," according to a phrase used by Emilia Rafols; by reason of this fact, all the rights of Koch &amp; Brunner were transferred to the said spouses,  and one of the rights  of Koch  &amp; Brunner was that if, on the  24th  of June, 1897,  the right of repurchase stipulated in the instrument of June 12, 1893, had not been exercised, the sale should  be finally consummated; wherefore,  as the property was  not  repurchased, the sale  to the Osmeña spouses became finally consummated on June 25, 1897.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"If the vendor should  not  comply with the provisions of article 1518 (concerning  redemption), the  vendee shall irrevocably acquire  the ownership  of the  thing  sold." (Civil Code, art. 1509.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is a conclusion of the judgment appealed from "that she (the applicant) repurchased the property from Messrs. Koch &amp; Brunner and has an interest therein."  (B. of e., p. 20.)</p>
<p>And, finally,  just as Koch &amp; Brunner might have, since July 25, 1897, applied for1  the registration of their title of absolute and full ownership to the property in question and for the issuance to them of an owner's title, pursuant to the new Land  Registration  Act,  so  also could  Agustina Rafols, from the said date,  obtain, and she can now obtain, the same rights, for identical reasons,  to  wit: because of the consolidation of the ownership and because the title of sale under right of  redemption  is converted into one of definite  and final sale, which is a perfectly adequate title for the transfer of ownership and all other real rights in the thing sold.</p>
<p>Therefore, the judgment appealed from is reversed, and the Court of Land Registration shall order the registration and issuance of title applied for by Agustina Rafols, as well as the cancellation of the instruments of sale under right of redemption, executed by Luisa Rafols and mentioned in the record, especially of that  of June 25, 1889.  No special assessment of costs is made  in this instance.   So ordered.</p>
