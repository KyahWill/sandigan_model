				<H3>LEUNG BEN, PLAINTIFF, VS. P. J. O'BRIEN ; JAMES A. OSTRAND AND GEO. R. HARVEY, JUDGES OF FIRST INSTANCE OF THE CITY OF MANILA, DEFENDANTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>STREET, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an application for a writ of certiorari, the purpose of which is to 
quash an attachment issued from the Court of First Instance of the City of 
Manila under circumstances hereinbelow stated.
<p>Upon December 12, 1917, an action was instituted in the Court of First 
Instance of the city of Manila by P. J. O'Brien to recover of Leung Ben the sum 
of P15,000, alleged to have been lost by the plaintiff to the defendant in a 
series of gambling, banking, and percentage games conducted during the two or 
three months prior to the institution of the suit. In his verified-complaint the 
plaintiff asked for an attachment, under sections 424 and 412 (1) of the Code of 
Civil Procedure, against the property of the defendant, on the ground that the 
latter was about to depart from the Philippine Islands with intent to defraud 
his creditors. This attachment was issued; and acting under the authority 
thereof, the sheriff attached the sum of P15,000 which had been deposited by the 
defendant with the International Banking Corporation.</p>
<p>The defendant thereupon appeared by his attorney and moved the court to quash 
the attachment. Said motion having been dismissed in the Court of First 
Instance, the petitioner, Leung Ben, the defendant in that action, presented to 
this court, upon January 8, 1918, his petition for the writ of certiorari 
directed against P. J. O'Brien and the judges of the Court of First Instance of 
the city of Manila whose names are mentioned in the caption hereof. The prayer 
is that the Honorable James A. Ostrand, as the judge having cognizance of the 
action in said court (P. J. O'Brien <em>vs</em>. Leung Ben) be required to 
certify the record to this court for review and that the order of attachment 
which had been issued should be revoked and discharged, with costs. Upon the 
filing of said petition in this court the usual order was entered requiring the 
defendants to show cause why the writ should not issue. The response of the 
defendants, in the nature of a demurrer, was filed upon January 21, 1918; and 
the matter is now heard upon the pleadings thus presented.</p>
<p>The provision of law under which this attachment was issued requires that 
there should be a "cause of action arising upon contract, express or implied." 
The contention of the petitioner is that the statutory action to recover money 
lost at gaming is not such an action as is contemplated in this provision, and 
he therefore insists that the original complaint shows on its face that the 
remedy of attachment is not available in aid thereof; that the Court of First 
Instance acted in excess of its jurisdiction in granting the writ of attachment; 
that the petitioner has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy by appeal or 
otherwise; and that consequently the writ of certiorari supplies the appropriate 
remedy for his relief.</p>
<p>The case presents the two following questions of law, either of which, if 
decided unfavorably to the petitioner, will be fatal to his application:</p>
<p>(1) Supposing that the Court of First Instance has granted an attachment for 
which there is no statutory authority; can this court entertain the present 
petition and grant the desired relief?</p>
<p>(2) Is the statutory obligation to restore money won at gaming an obligation 
arising from "contract, express or implied?"</p>
<p>We are of the opinion that the answer to the first question should be in the 
affirmative. Under section 514 of the Code of Civil Procedure the Supreme Court 
has original jurisdiction by the writ of certiorari over the proceedings of 
Courts of First Instance, "wherever said courts have exceeded their jurisdiction 
and there is no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy." In the same section, it is 
further declared that the proceedings in the Supreme Court in such cases shall 
be as prescribed for Courts of First Instance in sections 217-221, inclusive, of 
said Code. This has the effect of incorporating into the practice of the Supreme 
Court, so far as applicable, the provisions contained in those sections to the 
same extent as if they had been reproduced verbatim immediately after section 
514. Turning to section 217, we find that, in defining the conditions under 
which certiorari can be maintained in a Court of First Instance, substantially 
the same language is used as is found in section 514 relative to the conditions 
under which the same remedy can be maintained in the Supreme Court, namely, when 
the inferior tribunal has exceeded its jurisdiction and there is no appeal, nor 
any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy. In using these expressions the author of 
the Code of Civil Procedure merely adopted the language which, in American 
jurisdictions at least, had long ago reached the stage of a stereotyped 
formula.</p>
<p>In section 220 of the same Code, we have a provision relative to the final 
proceedings in certiorari, and herein it is stated that the court shall 
determine whether the inferior tribunal has regularly pursued its authority and 
that if it finds that such inferior tribunal has not regularly pursued its 
authority, it shall give judgment, either affirming, annulling, or modifying the 
proceedings below, as the law requires. The expression, "has not regularly 
pursued its authority," as here, used, is suggestive, and we think it should be 
construed in connection with the other expressions "have exceeded their 
jurisdiction," as used in section 514, and "has exceeded the jurisdiction," as 
used in section 217. Taking the three together, it results in our opinion that 
any irregular exercise of judicial power by a Court of First Instance, in excess 
of its lawful jurisdiction, is remediable by the writ of certiorari, provided 
there is no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy; and in order to make out a 
case for the granting of the writ it is not necessary that the court should have 
acted in the matter without any jurisdiction whatever. Indeed the repeated use 
of the expression "excess of jurisdiction" shows that the lawmaker contemplated 
the situation where a court, having jurisdiction, should irregularly transcend 
its authority as well as the situation where the court is totally devoid of 
lawful power.</p>
<p>It may be observed in this connection that the word "jurisdiction," as used 
in attachment cases, has reference not only to the authority of the court to 
entertain the principal action but also to its authority to issue the 
attachment, as dependent upon the existence of the statutory ground. (6 C. J., 
89.) This distinction between jurisdiction over the main cause and jurisdiction 
to issue the attachment as an ancillary remedy incident to the principal 
litigation is of importance; as a court's jurisdiction over the main action may 
be complete, and yet it may lack authority to grant an attachment as ancillary 
to such action. This distinction between jurisdiction over the principal 
proceeding and jurisdiction over the ancillary has been recognized by this court 
in connection with actions involving the appointment of a receiver. Thus, in 
Rocha &amp; Co. <em>vs</em>. Crossfield and Figueras (6 Phil. Rep., 355), a 
receiver had been appointed without legal justification. It was held that the 
order making the appointment was beyond the jurisdiction of the court; and 
though the court admittedly had jurisdiction of the main cause, the order was 
vacated by this court upon application for a writ of certiorari. (<em>See</em> 
Blanco <em>vs</em>. Ambler, 3 Phil. Rep., 358, Blanco <em>vs</em>. Ambler and 
McMicking 3 Phil. Rep., 735; Yangco <em>vs</em>. Rohde, 1 Phil. Rep., 404.)</p>
<p>By parity of reasoning it must follow that when a court issues a writ of 
attachment for which there is no statutory authority, it is acting irregularly 
and in excess of its jurisdiction, in the sense necessary to justify the Supreme 
Court in granting relief by the writ of certiorari. In applying this proposition 
it is of course necessary to take account of the difference between a ground of 
attachment based on the nature of the action and a ground of attachment based on 
the acts or the condition of the defendant. Every complaint must show a cause of 
action of some sort; and when the statute declares" that the attachment may 
issue in an action arising upon contract, express or implied, it announces a 
criterion which may be determined from an inspection of the language of the 
complaint. The determination of this question is purely a matter of law. On the 
other hand, when the statute declares that an attachment may be issued when the 
defendant is about to depart from the Islands, a criterion is announced which is 
wholly foreign to the cause of action; and the determination of it may involve a 
disputed question of fact which must be decided by the court. In making this 
determination, the court obviously acts within its powers; and it would be idle 
to suppose that the writ of certiorari would be available to reverse the action 
of a Court of First Instance in determining the sufficiency of the proof on such 
a disputed point, and in granting or refusing the attachment accordingly.</p>
<p>We should not be understood, in anything that has been said, as intending to 
infringe the doctrine enunciated by this court in Herrera <em>vs</em>. Barretto 
and Joaquin (25 Phil. Rep., 245), when properly applied. It was there held that 
we would not, upon an application for a writ of certiorari, dissolve an 
interlocutory mandatory injunction that had been issued in a Court of First 
Instance as an incident in an action of mandamus. The issuance of an 
interlocutory injunction depends upon conditions essentially different from 
those involved in the issuance of an attachment. The injunction is designed 
primarily for the prevention of irreparable injury and the use of the remedy is 
in a great measure dependent upon the exercise of discretion. Generally 
speaking, it may be said" that the exercise of the injunctive power is inherent 
in judicial authority; and ordinarily it would be impossible to distinguish 
between the jurisdiction of the court in the main litigation and its 
jurisdiction to grant an interlocutory injunction, for the latter is involved in 
the former. That the writ of certiorari can not be used to reverse an order 
denying a motion for a preliminary injunction is of course not open to cavil. 
(Somes <em>vs</em>. Crossfield and Molina, 8 Phil. Rep., 284.)</p>
<p>But it will be said that the writ of certiorari is not available in this 
case, because the petitioner is protected by the attachment bond, and that he 
has a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy by appeal. This suggestion seems to be 
sufficiently answered in the case of Rocha &amp; Co. <em>vs</em>. Crossfield and 
Figueras (6 Phil. Rep., 355), already referred to, and the earlier case there 
cited. The remedy by appeal is not sufficiently speedy to meet the exigencies of 
the case. An attachment is extremely violent, and its abuse may often result in 
the infliction of damage which could never be repaired by any pecuniary award at 
the final hearing. To postpone the granting of the writ in such a case until the 
final hearing and to compel the petitioner to bring the case here upon appeal 
merely in order to correct the action of the trial court in the matter of 
allowing the attachment would seem both unjust and unnecessary.</p>
<p>Passing to the problem propounded in the second question it may be observed 
that, upon general principles, recognized both in the civil and common law, 
money lost in gaming and voluntarily paid by the loser to the winner can not, in 
the absence of statute, be recovered in a civil action. But Act No. 1757 of the 
Philippine Commission, which defines and penalizes several forms of gambling, 
contains numerous provisions recognizing the right to recover money lost in 
gambling or in the playing of certain games (sees. 6, 7, 8, 9, 11). The original 
complaint in the action in the Court of First Instance is not clear as to the 
particular section of Act No. 1757 under which the action is brought, but it is 
alleged that the money was lost at gambling, banking, and percentage game in 
which the defendant was banker. It must therefore be assumed that the action is 
based upon the right of recovery given in section 7 of said Act, which declares 
that an action may be brought against the banker by any person losing money at a 
banking or percentage game.</p>
<p>Is this a cause of action arising upon contract, "express or implied," as 
this term is used infection 412 of the Code of Civil Procedure? To begin the 
discussion, the English version of the Code of Civil Procedure is controlling 
(sec. 15, Admin. Code, ed. of 1917). Furthermore, it is universally admitted to 
be proper in the interpretation of any statute, to consider its historical 
antecedents and its jurisprudential sources. The Code of Civil Procedure, as is 
well known, is an American contribution to Philippine legislation. It therefore 
speaks the language of the common-law and for the most part reflects its ideas. 
When the draftsman of this Code used the expression "contract, express or 
implied," he used a phrase that has been long current among writers on American 
and English law; and it is therefore appropriate to resort to that system of law 
to discover the meaning which the legislator intended to convey by those terms. 
We remark in passing that the expression "<em>contrato tacito</em>," used in the 
official translation of the Code of Civil Procedure as the Spanish equivalent of 
"implied contract," does not appear to render the full sense of the English 
expression.</p>
<p>The English contract law, so far as relates to simple contracts (i. e. 
contracts not evidenced by a sealed instrument or a judicial record), is planted 
upon two foundations, which are supplied by two very different conceptions of 
legal liability. These two conceptions are revealed in the ideas respectively 
underlying (1) the common-law debt and (2) the assumptual promise. In the early 
and formative stages of the common-law the only simple contract of which the 
courts took account was the real contract or contract re, in which the 
contractual duty imposed by law arises upon the delivery of a chattel, as in the 
<em>mutuum, commodatum, depositum</em>, and the like; and the purely consensual 
agreements of the Roman Law found no congenial place in the early common law 
system.</p>
<p>In course of time the idea underlying the contract <em>re</em> was extended 
so as to include all cases where there was something of value passing from one 
person to another under such circumstance as to constitute a <em>justa causa 
debendi.</em> The obligation thereby created was a debt. The constitutive 
element in this obligation is found in the fact that the debtor has received 
something from the creditor, which he is bound by the obligation of law to 
return or pay for. From an early day this element was denominated the <em>quid 
pro quo</em>, an ungainly phrase coined by Mediaeval Latinity. The <em>quid pro 
quo</em> was primarily a material or pyhsical object, and it constituted the 
recompense or equivalent acquired by the debtor. Upon the passage of the 
<em>quid pro quo</em> from one party to the other, the law imposed that real 
contractual duty peculiar to the debt. No one conversant with the early history 
of the English law would ever conceive of the debt as an obligation created by 
promise. It is the legal duty to pay or deliver a sum certain of money or an 
ascertainable quantity of ponderable or measurable chattels.</p>
<p>The ordinary debt, as already stated, originates in a contract in which a 
<em>quid pro quo</em> passes to the debtor at the time of the creation of the 
debt, but the term is equally applicable to duties imposed by custom, or 
statute, or by judgment of a court.</p>
<p>The existence of a debt supposes one person to have possession of a thing 
(<em>res</em>) which he owes and hence ought to turn over the owner. This 
obligation is the oldest conception of contract with which the common law is 
familiar; and notwithstanding the centuries that have rolled over Westminster 
Hall that conception remains as one of the fundamental bases of the common-law 
contract.</p>
<p>Near the end of the fifteenth century there was evolved in England a new 
conception of contractual liability, which embodied the idea of obligation 
resulting from promise and which found expression in the common law assumpsit, 
or parol promise supported by a consideration. The application of this novel 
conception had the effect of greatly extending the field of contractual 
liability and by this means rights of action came to be recognized which had 
been unknown before. The action of assumpsit which was the instrument for giving 
effect to this obligation was found to be a useful remedy; and presently this 
action came to be used for the enforcement of common-law debts. The result was 
to give to our contract law the superficial appearance of being based more or 
lees exclusively upon the notion of the obligation of promise.</p>
<p>An idea is widely entertained to the effect that all simple contracts 
recognized in the common-law system are referable to a single category. They all 
have their roots, so many of us imagine, in one general notion of obligation; 
and of course the obligation of promise is supposed to supply this general 
notion, being considered a sort of <em>menstruum</em> in which all other forms 
of contractual obligation have been dissolved. This is a mistake. The idea of 
contractual duty embodied in the debt, which was the first conception of 
contract liability revealed in th.e common law, has remained, although it was 
destined to be in a measure obscured by the more modern conception of obligation 
resulting from promise.</p>
<p>What has been said is intended to exhibit the fact that the duty to pay or 
deliver a sum certain of money or an ascertainable quantity of ponderable or 
measurable chattels—which is indicated by the term debt—has ever been 
recognized, in the common-law system, as a true contract, regardless of the 
source of the duty or the manner in which it is created—whether derived from 
custom, statute or some consensual transaction depending upon the voluntary acts 
of the parties. The form of contract known as the "debt" is of most ancient 
lineage; and when reference is had to historical antecedents, the right of the 
debt to be classed as a contract cannot be questioned. Indeed when the new form 
of engagement consisting of the parol promise supported by a consideration first 
appeared, it was looked upon as an upstart and its right to be considered a true 
contract was questioned. It was long customary to refer to it exclusively as an 
assumpsit, agreement, undertaking, or parol promise, in fact anything but a 
contract. Only in time did the new form of engagement attain the dignity of 
being classed among true contracts.</p>
<p>The term "implied contract" takes us into the shadowy domain of those 
obligations the theoretical classification of which has engaged the attention of 
scholars from the time of Gaius until our own day and has been a source of as 
much difficulty to the civilian as to the common-law jurist. Here we are 
concerned with those acts which make one person debtor to another without there 
having intervened between them any true agreement tending to produce a legal 
bond (<em>vinculum juris</em>). Of late years some American and English legal 
writers have adopted the term quasi-contract as descriptive of these obligations 
or some of them; but the expression more commonly used is "implied 
contract."</p>
<p>Upon examination of these obligations, from the view point of the common-law 
jurisprudence, it will be found that they fall readily into two divisions, 
according as they bear an analogy to the common-law debt or to the common-law 
assumpsit. To exhibit the scope of these different classes of obligations is 
here impracticable. It is only necessary in this connection to observe that the 
most conspicuous division is that which comprises duties in the nature of debt. 
The characteristic feature of these obligations is that upon certain states of 
fact the law imposes an obligation to pay a sum certain of money; and it is 
characteristic of this obligation that the money in respect to which the duty is 
raised is conceived as being the equivalent of something taken or detained under 
circumstances giving rise to the duty to return or compensate therefor. The 
proposition that no one shall be allowed to enrich himself unduly at the expense 
of another embodies the general principle here lying at the basis of obligation. 
The right to recover money improperly paid (<em>repetition de lo indebido</em>) 
is also recognized as belonging to this class of duties.</p>
<p>It will be observed that according to the Civil Code (article 1089) 
obligations are supposed to be derived either from (1) the law, (2) contracts 
and quasi-contracts, (3) illicit acts and omissions, or (4) acts in which some 
sort of blame or negligence is present. This enumeration of the sources of 
obligations supposes that the quasi-contractual obligation and the obligation 
imposed by law are of different types. The learned Italian jurist, Jorge Giorgi, 
criticises this assumption and says that the classification embodied in the code 
is theoretically erroneous. His conclusion is that one or the other of these 
categories should have been suppressed and merged in the other. (Giorgi, 
<em>Teoria de Uts Obligaciones</em>, Spanish ed., vol. 5 arts. 5, 7, 9.) The 
validity of this criticism is, we think, self-evident; and it is of interest to 
note that the common law makes no distinction between the two sources of 
liability. The obligations which in the Code are indicated as quasi-contracts, 
as well as those arising <em>ex lege</em>, are in the common law system merged 
into the category of obligations imposed by law, and all are denominated implied 
contracts.</p>
<p>Many refinements, more or less illusory, have been attempted by various 
writers in distinguishing different sorts of implied contracts, as, for example, 
the contract implied as of fact and the contract implied as of law (or 
constructive contract). No explanation of these distinctions will be here 
attempted. Suffice it to say that the term "contract, express or implied" is 
used by common-law jurists to include all purely personal obligations other than 
those which have their source in delict, or tort. As to these it may be said 
that, generally speaking, the law does not impose a contractual duty upon a 
wrongdoer to compensate for injury done. It is true that in certain situations 
where a wrongdoer unjustly acquires something at the expense of another, the law 
imposes on him a duty to surrender his unjust acquisitions, and the injured 
party may here elect to sue upon this contractual duty instead of suing upon the 
tort; but even here the distinction between the two liabilities, in contract and 
in tort, is never lost to sight; and it is always recognized that the liability 
arising out of the tort is delictual and not of a contractual or 
quasi-contractual nature.</p>
<p>In the case now under consideration the duty of the defendant to refund the 
money which he won from the plaintiff at gaming is a duty imposed by statute. It 
therefore arises <em>ex lege</em>. Furthermore, it is a duty to return a certain 
sum which had passed from the plaintiff to the defendant. By all the criteria 
which the common law supplies, this is a duty in the nature of debt and is 
properly classified as an implied contract. It is well-settled by the English 
authorities that money lost in gambling or by lottery, if recoverable at all, 
can be recovered by the loser in an action of <em>indebitatus assumpsit</em> for 
money had and received. (Clarke vs. Johnson, Lofft, 759; Mason vs. Waite, 17 
Mass., 560; Burnham <em>vs</em>. Fisher, 25 Vt., 514.) This means that in the 
common law the duty to return money won in this way is an implied contract, or 
quasi-contract.</p>
<p>It is no argument to say in reply to this that the obligation here recognized 
is called an implied contract merely because the remedy commonly used in suing 
upon ordinary contracts can be here used, or that the law adopted the fiction of 
a promise in order to bring the obligation within the scope of the action of 
<em>assumpsit</em>. Such statements fail to express the true import of the 
phenomenon. Before the remedy was the idea; and the use of the remedy could not 
have been approved if it had not been for historical antecedents which made the 
recognition of this remedy at once logical and proper. Furthermore, it should 
not be forgotten that the question is not how this duty came to be recognized in 
the common law as a contractual duty but what sort of obligation did the author 
of the Code of Civil Procedure intend to describe when he used the term implied 
contract in section 412.</p>
<p>In what has been said we have assumed that the obligation which is at the 
foundation of the original action in the court below is not a quasi-contract, 
when judged by the principles of the civil law. A few observations will show 
that this assumption is not by any means free from doubt. The obligation in 
question certainly does not fall under the definition of either of the two 
quasi-contracts which are made the subject of special treatment in the Civil 
Code, for it does not arise from a licit act as contemplated in article 1887 and 
the money was not paid under error as contemplated in article 1895. The 
obligation is clearly a creation of the positive law—a circumstance which brings 
it within the purview of article 1090, in relation with article 1089; and it is 
also derived from an illicit act, namely, the playing of a prohibited game. It 
is thus seen that the provisions of the Civil Code which might be consulted with 
a view to the correct theoretical classification of this obligation are 
unsatisfactory and confusing.</p>
<p>The two obligations treated in the chapter devoted to quasi-contracts in the 
Civil Code are: (1) The obligation incident to the officious management of the 
affairs of other persons (<em>gestion de negocios ajenos</em>) and (2) the 
recovery of what has been improperly paid (cobro de lo indebido). That the 
authors of the Civil Code selected these two obligations for special treatment 
does not signify an intention to deny the possibility of the existence of other 
quasi-contractual obligations. As is well said by the commentator Manresa.</p>
<p>"The number of the quasi-contracts may be indefinite as may be the number of 
lawful facts, the generations of the said obligations; but the Code, just as we 
shall see further on, in the impracticableness of enumerating or including them 
all in a methodical and orderly classification, has concerned itself with two 
only—namely, the management of the affairs of other persons and the recovery of 
things improperly paid—without attempting by this to exclude the others." 
(Manresa, 2d ed., vol. 12, p. 549.)</p>
<p>It would indeed have been surprising if the authors of the Code, in the light 
of the jurisprudence of more than a thousand years, should have arbitrarily 
assumed to limit the quasi-contracts to two obligations. The author from whom we 
have just quoted further observes that the two obligations in question were 
selected for special treatment in the Code not only because they were the most 
conspicuous of the quasi-contracts, but because they had not been the subject of 
consideration in other parts of the Code. (Opus citat., p. 550.)</p>
<p>It is well recognized among civilian jurists that the quasi-contractual 
obligations cover a wide range. The Italian jurist, Jorge Giorgi, to whom we 
have already referred, considers under this head, among other obligations, the 
following: payments made upon a future consideration which is not realized, or 
upon an existing consideration which fails; payments wrongfully made upon a 
consideration which is contrary to law, or opposed to public policy; and 
payments made upon a vicious consideration or obtained by illicit means 
(Giorgi,<em> Teoria de las Obligaciones</em>, vol. 5, art. 130.)</p>
<p>In permitting the recovery of money lost at play, Act No. 1757 has introduced 
modifications in the application of articles 1798,1801, and 1305 of the Civil 
Code. The first two of these articles relate to gambling contracts, while 
article 1305 treats of the nullity of contracts proceeding from a vicious or 
illicit consideration. Taking all these provisions together, it must be apparent 
that the obligation to return money lost at play has a decided affinity to 
contractual obligations; and we believe that it could, without violence to the 
doctrines of the civil law, be held that such obligations is an innominate 
quasi-contract. It is, however, unnecessary to place the decision on this 
ground.</p>
<p>From what has been said it follows that in our opinion the cause of action 
stated in the complaint in the court below is based on a contract, express or 
implied, and is therefore of such nature that the court had authority to issue 
the writ of attachment. The application for the writ of certiorari must 
therefore be denied and the proceedings dismissed. So ordered.</p>

<p><strong>MALCOLM, J.</strong>, <em>concurring</em>:</p>
<p>As I finished reading the learned and interesting decision of the majority, 
the impression which remained was that the court was enticed by the nice and 
unusual points presented to make a hard case out of an easy one, and 
unfortunately to do violence to the principles of certiorari. The simple 
questions are: Did the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila exceed its 
jurisdiction in granting an attachment against the property of the defendant, 
now plaintiff? Has this defendant, now become the plaintiff, any other plain, 
speedy, and adequate remedy? The answers are found in the decision of this 
court, in Herrera <em>vs</em>. Barretto and Joaquin ([1913], 25 Phil., 245), 
from which I quote the following:</p>
<p>"It has been repeatedly held by this court that a writ of certiorari will not 
be issued unless it clearly appears that the court to which it is to be directed 
acted without or in excess of jurisdiction. It will not be issued to cure errors 
in the proceedings or to correct erroneous conclusions of law or of fact. If the 
court has jurisdiction of the subject matter and of the person, decisions upon 
all questions pertaining to the cause are decisions within its jurisdiction and, 
however irregular or erroneous they may be, cannot be corrected by certiorari. 
The Code of Civil Procedure giving Courts of First Instance general jurisdiction 
in actions for mandamus, it goes without saying that the Court of First Instance 
had jurisdiction in the present case to resolve every question arising in such 
an action and to decide every question presented to it which pertained to the 
cause. It has already been held by this court that, while it is a power to be 
exercised only in extreme cases, a Court of First Instance has power to issue a 
mandatory injunction to stand until the final determination of the action in 
which it is issued. While the issuance of the mandatory injunction in this 
particular case may have been irregular and erroneous, a question concerning 
which we express no opinion, nevertheless its issuance was within the 
jurisdiction of the court and its action is not reviewable on certiorari. It is 
not sufficient to say that it was issued wrong fully and without sufficient 
grounds and in the absence oj the other party. The question is, Did the court 
act with jurisdiction?</p>
<p>"It has been urged that the court exceeded its jurisdiction in requiring the 
municipal president to issue the license, for the reason that he was not the 
proper person to issue it and that, if he was the proper person, he had tht 
right to exercise a discretion as to whom the license shouk be issued. We do not 
believe that either of these questions goes to the jurisdiction of the court to 
act. One of tht fundamental questions in a mandamus against a public officer is 
whether or not that officer has the right to exercise discretion in the 
performance of the act which the plaintiff asks him to perform. It is one of the 
essential determinations of the cause. To claim that the resolution of that 
question may deprive the court of jurisdiction is to assert a novel proposition. 
It is equivalent to the contention that a court has jurisdiction if he decides 
right but no jurisdiction if he decides wrong. It may be stated generally that 
it is never necessary to decide the fundamental questions of a cause to 
determine whether the court has jurisdiction. The question of jurisdiction is 
preliminary and never touches the merits of the case. The determination of the 
fundamental questions of a cause are merely the exercise of a jurisdiction 
already conceded. In the case at bar no one denies the power, authority, or 
jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance to take cognizance of an action for 
mandamus and to decide every question which arises in that cause and pertains 
thereto. The contention that the decision of one of those questions, if wrong, 
destroys jurisdiction involves an evident contradiction.</p>
<p>"Jurisdiction is the authority to hear and determine a cause—the right to act 
in a case. Since it is the power to hear and determine, it does not depend 
either upon the regularity of the exercise of that power or upon the 
rightfulness of the decisions made. Jurisdiction should therefore be 
distinguished from the exercise of jurisdiction. The authority to decide a cause 
at all, and not the decision rendered therein, is what makes up jurisdiction. 
Where there is jurisdiction of the person and subject matter, as we have said 
before, the decision of all other questions arising in the case is but an 
exercise of that jurisdiction."</p>
<p>Then follows an elaborate citation and discussion of American authorities, 
including a decision of the United States Supreme Court and of the applicable 
Philippine cases. The decision continues:</p>
<p>"The reasons given in these cases last cited for the allowance of the writ of 
prohibition are applicable only to the class of cases with which the decisions 
deal and do not in any way militate against the general proposition herein 
asserted. Those which relate to election contests are based upon the principle 
that those proceedings are special in their nature and must be strictly 
followed, a material departure from the statute resulting in a loss, or in an 
excess, of jurisdiction. The cases relating to receivers are based, in a 
measure, upon the same principle, the appointment of a receiver being governed 
by the statute; and in part upon the theory that the appointment of a receiver 
in an improper case is in substance a bankruptcy proceeding, the taking of which 
is expressly prohibited by law. The case relative to the allowance of alimony 
<em>pendente lite</em> when the answer denies the marriage is more difficult to 
distinguish. The reasons in support of the doctrine laid down in that case are 
given in the opinion in full and they seem to place the particular case to which 
they refer in a class by itself.</p>
<p>"It is not a light thing that the lawmakers have abolished writs of error and 
with them certiorari and prohibition, in so far as they were methods by which 
the mere errors of an inferior court could be corrected. As instruments to that 
end they no longer exist. Their place is now taken by the appeal. So long as the 
inferior court retains jurisdiction its errors can be corrected only by that 
method. The office of the writ of certiorari has been reduced to the correction 
of defects of <em>jurisdiction</em> solely and cannot legally be used for any 
other purpose. It is truly an extraordinary remedy and, in this jurisdiction, 
its use is restricted to truly extraordinary cases—cases in which the action of 
the inferior court is wholly void; where any further steps in the case would 
result in a waste of time and money and would produce no result whatever; where 
the parties, or their privies, would be utterly deceived; where a final judgment 
or decree would be nought but a snare and a delusion, deciding nothing, 
protecting nobody, a judicial pretension, a recorded falsehood, a standing 
menace. It is only to avoid such results as these that a writ of certiorari is 
issuable; and even here an appeal will lie if the aggrieved party prefers to 
prosecute it.</p>
<p><em>"A full and thorough examination of all the decided cases in this court 
touching the question of certiorari and prohibition fuUy supports the 
proposition already stated that, where a Court of First Instance has 
jurisdiction of the subject matter and of the person, its decision of any 
question pertaining to the cause, however erroneous, cannot be reviewed by 
certiorari, but must be corrected by appeal."</em></p>
<p>I see no reason to override the decision in Herrera <em>vs</em>. Barretto and 
Joaquin (<em>supra</em>). Accordingly, I can do no better than to make the 
language of Justice Moreland my own. Applying these principles, it is 
self-evident that this court should not entertain the present petition and 
should not grant the desired relief.</p>

<p align="center"><em><strong>DISSENTING OPINION</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>FISHER, J.</strong>, <em>dissenting</em>:</p>
<p>I am in full accord with the view that the remedy of <em>certiorari</em> may 
be invoked in such cases as this, but I am constrained to dissent from the 
opinion of the majority as regards the meaning of the term "implied 
contract."</p>
<p>Section 412 of the Code of Civil Procedure, in connection with section 424, 
authorizes the preliminary attachment of the property of the defendant: "(1) In 
an action for the recovery of money or damages on a cause of action arising upon 
contract, express or implied, when the defendant is about to depart from the 
Philippine Islands, with intent to defraud his creditors; (2) * * *; (3) * * *; 
(4) * * *; (5) When the defendant has removed or disposed of his property, or is 
about to do so, with intent to defraud his creditors."</p>
<p>It is evident that the terms of paragraph five of the article cited are much 
broader than those of the first paragraph. The fifth paragraph * is not limited 
to actions arising from contract, but is by its terms applicable to actions 
brought for the purpose of enforcing extra-contractual rights as well as 
contractual rights. The limitation upon cases falling under paragraph five is to 
be found, not in the character of the obligation for the enforcement for which 
the action is brought, but in the terms of article 426, which requires that the 
affidavit show that "the amount due the plaintiff * * * is as much as the sum 
for which the order is granted."</p>
<p>That is to say, when an application is made for a preliminary attachment upon 
the ground that the plaintiff is about to dispose of his property with intent to 
defraud his creditors—thus bringing the case within the terms of paragraph five 
of the section—it is not necessary to show that the obligation in suit is 
contractual in its origin, but it is sufficient to show that the breach of the 
obligation, as shown by the facts stated in the complaint and affidavit, imposes 
upon the defendant the obligation to pay a specific and definite sum. For 
example, if it is alleged in the complaint that the defendant by his negligence, 
has caused the destruction by fire of a building belonging to plaintiff, and 
that such building was worth a certain sum of money, these facts would show a 
definite basis upon which to authorize the granting of the writ. But if it were 
averred that the defendant has published a libel concerning the plaintiff, to 
the injury of his feelings and reputation, there is no definite basis upon which 
to grant an attachment, because the amount of the damage suffered, being 
necessarily uncertain and indeterminate, cannot be ascertained definitely until 
the trial has been completed.</p>
<p>But it appears that the legislature, although it has seen fit to authorize a 
preliminary attachment in aid of actions of all kinds when the defendant is 
concealing his property with intent to defraud his creditors, has provided that 
when the ground of attachment is that the defendant is about to depart from the 
country with intent to defraud his creditors, the writ will issue only when the 
action in aid of which it is sought arises from a contract "express or implied." 
If an attachment were permitted upon facts bringing the application within the 
first paragraph of the section in support of actions of any kind, whether the 
obligation sued upon is contractual or not, then paragraph five would by 
construction be made absolutely identical with paragraph one, and this would be 
in effect equivalent to the complete elimination of the last two lines of the 
first paragraph. It is a rule of statutory construction that effect should be 
given to all parts of the statute, if possible. I can see no reason why the 
legislature should have limited cases falling within the first paragraph to 
actions arising from contract and have refrained from imposing this limitation 
with respect to cases falling within the terms of the fifth paragraph, but this 
should have no effect upon us in <em>applying</em> the law. Whether there be a 
good reason for it or not the distinction exists.</p>
<p>Had the phrase "express or implied" not been used to qualify "contract," 
there would be no doubt whatever with regard to the meaning of the word. In the 
Spanish civil law contracts are always consensual, and it would be impossible to 
define as a contract the juridical relation existing between a person who has 
lost money at gaming and the winner of such money, simply because the law 
imposes upon the winner the obligation of making restitution. An obligation of 
this kind, far from being consensual in its origin, arises <em>against</em> the 
will of the debtor. To call such a relation a <em>contract</em> is, from the 
standpoint of the civil law, a contradiction in terms.</p>
<p>But it is said that as the phrase "express or implied" has been used to 
qualify the word "contract," and these words are found in a statute which 
"speaks the language of the common law," this implies the introduction into our 
law of the concept of the "implied contract" of the English common law, a 
concept which embraces a certain class of obligations originating <em>ex 
lege</em>, which have been arbitrarily classified" as contracts, so that they 
might be enforced by one of the formal actions of the common law which legal 
tradition and practice has reserved for the enforcement of contract. I cannot 
concur in this reasoning, I believe that when a technical juridical term of 
substantive law is used in the adjective law of these Islands, we should seek 
its meaning in our own substantive law rather than in the law of America or of 
England. The Code of Civil Procedure was not enacted to establish rules of 
substantive law, but upon the assumption of the existence of these rules.</p>
<p>In the case of Cayce <em>vs</em>. Curtis (Dallam's Decisions, Texas Reports, 
403), it appears that the legislature, at a time when that State still retained 
to a large extent the Spanish substantive civil law, enacted a statute in which 
the word "bond" is used. In litigation involving the construction of that 
statute, one of the parties contended that the word "bond" should be given the 
technical meaning which it had in the English Common Law. The court rejected 
this contention, saying—</p>
<p>"On the first point it is urged by counsel for the appellant that the word 
'bond,' used in the statute, being a common law term, we must refer to the 
common law for its legal signification; and that by that law no instrument is a 
bond which is not under seal. The truth of the proposition that sealing is an 
absolute requisite to the validity of a bond at common law is readily admitted; 
but the applicability of that rule to the case under consideration is not 
perceived. This bond was taken at a time when the common law afforded no rule 
.of decision or practice in this country, and consequently that law cannot be 
legitimately resorted to, even for the purpose for which it is invoked by the 
counsel for the appellant, unless it be shown that the civil law (which under 
certain modifications was at that time the law of the land) had no term of 
similar import; for we regard it as a correct rule of construction, that where 
technical terms are used in a statute, they are to be referred for their 
signification to terms of similar import in the system of laws which prevails in 
the country where the statute is passed, and not to another system which is 
entirely foreign to the whole system of municipal regulations by which that 
country is governed. (Martin's Reports, vol. 3, 185; 7 Martin [N. S.], 
162.)"</p>
<p>Consequently, I believe that in the interpretation of the phrase "contract, 
express or implied," we should apply the rules of our own substantive law. The 
phrase in itself offers no difficulty. The concept of the contract, under the 
Civil Code, as a legal relation of <em>exclusively</em> consensual origin, 
offers no difficulty. Nor is any difficulty encountered in the grammatical sense 
of the words "express" and "implied." "Express," according to the New 
International Dictionary is "that which is directly and distinctly stated; 
expressed, not merely implied or left to inference." Therefore, a contract 
entered into by means of letters, in which the offer and the acceptance have 
been manifested by appropriate words, would be an "express contract." The word 
"imply," according to the same dictionary, is "to involve in substance or 
essence, or by fair inference, or by construction of law, when not expressly 
stated in words or signs; to contain by implication; to include virtually." </p>
<p>Therefore, if I enter a tailor shop and order a suit of clothes, although 
nothing is said regarding payment, it is an inference, both logical and legal, 
from my act that it is my intention to pay the reasonable value of the garments. 
The contract is implied, but it is none the less purely consensual. An implied 
contract, therefore, is that in which the <em>consent</em> of the parties is 
implied.</p>
<p>Manresa, commenting upon article 1262 of the Civil Code, says:</p>
<p>"The essence of consent is the agreement of the parties concerning that which 
is to constitute the contract * * *. The forms of this agreement may vary 
according to whether it is expressed verbally or in writing, by words or by 
acts. Leaving the other differences for consideration hereafter, we will only 
refer now to those which exist between <em>express</em> consent and 
<em>implied</em> consent * * *. It is unquestionable that <em>implied</em> 
consent manifested bf acts or conduct, produces a contract * * *."</p>
<p>If it were necessary to have recourse to the English common law for the 
purpose of ascertaining the meaning of the phrase under consideration, we could 
find many decisions which gave it the same meaning as that for which I 
contend.</p>
<p>"An implied contract is where one party receives benefits from another party, 
under such circumstances that the law presumes a promise on the part of the 
party benefited to pay a reasonable price for the same." (Jones <em>vs</em>. 
Tucker [Del.], 84 Atlantic, 1012.)</p>
<p>It is true that English courts have extended the concept of the term 
"contract" to include certain obligations arising <em>ex lege</em> without 
consent, express or implied. True contracts created by implied consent are 
designated in the English common law as "contracts implied in fact," while the 
so-called "contracts" in which the consent is a fiction of law are called 
"contracts implied by law." But it is evident that the latter are not real 
contracts. They have been called "contracts" arbitrarily by the courts of 
England, and those of the United States in which the English common law is in 
force, in order that certain actions arising <em>ex lege</em> may be enforced by 
the action of assumpsit. In the rigid formulism of the English common law the 
substantive right had to be accommodated to the form of action. As is stated in 
the monograph on the action of assumpsit in Ruling Case Law (volume 2, p. 
743)—</p>
<p>"In theory it was an action to recover for the nonperformance of simple 
contracts, and the formula and proceedings were constructed and carried on 
accordingly. * * * From the reign of Elizabeth this action has been extended to 
almost every case where an obligation arises from natural reason, * * * and it 
is now maintained in many cases which its principles do not comprehend and where 
fictions and intendments are resorted to, to fit the actual cause of action to 
the theory of the remedy. It is thus sanctioned where there has been no * * * 
real contract, but where some duty is deemed sufficient to justify the court in 
<em>imputing</em> a promise to perform it, and hence in <em>bending the 
transaction</em> to the <em>form of action</em>."</p>
<p>In the ancient English common law procedure the form of the action was 
regarded as being much more important than the substantive right to be enforced. 
If no form of action was found into which the facts would fit, so much the worse 
for the facts! To avoid the injustices to which this condition of affairs gave 
rise, the judges invented those fictions which permitted them to preserve the 
appearance of conservatism and change the law without expressly admitting that 
they were doing so. The indispensable averment, without which the action of 
assumpsit would not lie, was that the defendant <em>promised</em> to pay 
plaintiff the amount demanded. (Sector <em>vs</em>. Holmes, 17 Va., 566.) In 
true contracts, whether express or implied, this promise in fact exists. In 
obligations arising ex legs there is no such promise, and therefore the action 
of assumpsit could not be maintained, although by reason of its relative 
simplicity it was one of the most favored forms of action. In order to permit 
the litigant to make use of this form of action for the enforcement of certain 
classes of obligations arising <em>ex lege</em>, the judges invented the 
<em>fiction</em> of the promise of the defendant to pay the amount of the 
obligation, and as this fictitious promise gives the appearance of consensuality 
to the legal relations of the parties, the name of implied contract is given to 
that class of extra-contractual obligations enforcible by the action of 
assumpsit.</p>
<p>Now, it is not to be supposed that it was the intention of the Legislature in 
making use in the first paragraph of article 412 of the phrase "contract, 
express or implied" to corrupt the logical simplicity of our concept of 
obligations by importing into our law the antiquated fictions of the mediaeval 
English common law. If one of the concepts of the term "implied contract" in the 
English common law, namely, that in which <em>consent</em> is presumed from the 
conduct of the debtor, harmonizes with the concept of the contract in our law, 
why should we reject that meaning and hold that the Legislature intended to use 
this phrase in the foreign and illogical sense of a "contract" arising without 
consent? This is a civil law country. Why should we be compelled to study the 
fictions of the ancient English common law, in order to be informed as to the 
meaning of the word "contract" in the law of the Philippine Islands? Much more 
reasonable to my mind was the conclusion of the Texas court, under similar 
circumstances, to the effect that "Where technical terms are used in a statute 
they are to be referred for their signification to terms of similar import in 
the system of laws which prevails in the country where the statute is passed." 
(Cayce <em>vs</em>. Curtis, <em>supra</em>.)</p>
<p>My conclusion is that the phrase "contract, express or implied" should be 
interpreted in the grammatical sense of the words and limited to true contracts, 
consensual obligations arising from <em>consent</em>, whether expressed in 
words, writing or signs, or presumed from conduct. As it is evident that the 
defendant in the present case never promised, expressly or by implication, to 
return the money won from him in the gambling game in question, his obligation 
to restore the amount so won, imposed by the <em>law</em>, is not contractual, 
but purely extra-contractual, and therefore the action brought not being one 
arising upon "contract, express or implied," the plaintiff is not entitled to a 
preliminary attachment upon the averment that the defendant is about to depart 
from the Philippine Islands with intent to defraud his creditors, no averment 
being made in the complaint or in the affidavit that the defendant has removed 
or disposed of his property, or is about to depart with intent to defraud his 
creditors, so as to bring the case within the terms of the fifth paragraph of 
section 412.</p>
<p>I am unable to agree with the contention of the applicant (brief, p. 39) here 
that the phrase in question should be interpreted in such a way as to include 
all obligations, whether arising from consent or <em>ex lege</em>, because that 
is equivalent to eliminating all distinction between the first and the fifth 
paragraphs by practically striking out the first two lines of paragraph one. The 
Legislature has deliberately established this distinction, and while we may be 
unable to see any reason why it should have been made, it is our duty to apply 
and <em>interpret</em> the law, and we are not authorized under the guise of 
interpretation to virtually repeal part of the statute.</p>
<p>Nor can it be said that the relations between the parties litigant constitute 
a quasi contract. In the first place, quasi contracts are "<em>lawful</em> and 
purely voluntary acts by which the authors thereof become obligated in favor of 
a third person * * *." (Civil Code, article 1887.) The act which gave rise to 
the obligation <em>ex lege</em> relied upon by the plaintiff in the court below 
is <em>illicit</em>—an unlawful gambling game. In the second place, the first 
paragraph of section 412 of the Code of Civil Procedure does not authorize an 
attachment in actions arising out of <em>quasi contracts</em>, but only in 
actions arising out of <em>contracts</em>, express or implied.</p>
<p>I am therefore of the opinion that the court below was without jurisdiction 
to issue the writ of attachment, and that the writ should be declared null and 
void.</p></div>
