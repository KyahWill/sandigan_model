				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The undisputed evidence of record conclusively establishes the guilt of the 
defendant and appellant of the offense of which he was convicted in the court 
below.
<p>In corroboration of the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution, to 
the effect that the house mentioned in the information was a notorious 
"opium-den" or "opiumjoint," the Government submitted in evidence the records of 
various cases on file in the court below, with the unchallenged statement that 
these records disclosed that, on more than one occasion, it had been judicially 
declared that this house was in whole, or in part, an "opium-joint," or 
"opium-den," These records were not brought here together with the record of 
this case on appeal, and if the oral evidence of record did not conclusively 
establish the character of the house, we would be compelled to acquit this 
appellant, or to suspend these proceedings in order that the record might be 
perfected in this regard. We are satisfied, however, in view of the oral 
evidence, that the failure to bring these records to this court on appeal has in 
nowise prejudiced the substantial rights of the appellant. It was, of course, 
the duty of the clerk of the trial court to forward these records together with 
the record of the case under consideration, and it was also the duty of the 
Government to take the proper measures to perfect the record as soon as the 
omission was discovered, and our action in this case should not be construed as 
putting the stamp of approval upon such omissions in the future. But counsel for 
the appellant having deemed it expedient to refrain from exercising his 
undoubted privilege to have the case suspended until the omissions in the record 
could be corrected ; and there not being any evidence in the record tending 
<em>in the slightest degree</em> to put in doubt the truth of the testimony of 
the witnesses as to the fact that the house in question was an "opiumden;" we 
think it will make for the prompt administration of justice and for the best 
interests of the appellant himself to confirm the judgment entered in the court 
below, without the delay incident to the issuance of and compliance with orders 
looking to the bringing of the records in question to this court.</p>
<p>We conclude that the judgment entered in the court below, convicting and 
sentencing this appellant, should be affirmed, with the costs of this instance 
<em>de officio</em>. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Johnson, Araullo, Street</em> and <em>Malcolm, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p></div>
