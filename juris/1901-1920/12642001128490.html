				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This case has come up on  appeal from  a judgment rendered  in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, in a prosecution for adultery, in which the  trial court found the defendant guilty and sentenced  her to four years nine months and eleven days of prisidn correctional, and to pay the costs of the prosecution.   The complaint is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The  undersigned, husband of Maria Asuncion, accuses the said  Maria Asuncion  of the crime  of adultery,  committed as follows: </p>
  <p>"That on  or about or between October 23,1910, and October 27, 1910,  in the city of Manila,  Philippine Islands, the said Maria  Asuncion, being the lawful  wife of the  complainant, Carlos de  Lalinde,  did  willfully,  illegally, and                 criminally, lie with a man who is not her husband, to wit, with one R. L, Larson, who lay with her not knowing that she was a married woman.   In violation of law."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To this complaint counsel for the defendant filed  a demurrer on the ground that it was fatally defective under the provisions of article 434 of the Penal  Code, in that  it did not  include the wife's paramour as a party defendant together with the wife.</p>
<p>The trial  court overruled  the demurrer  and but two witnesses were called,  the  husband of the accused and  a policeman.  The defense offered no evidence and declined to cross-examine the witnesses  for  the prosecution, there having been an  agreement of counsel whereby  only such evidence was  offered by the prosecution  as was necessary to  prove the  essential  facts charged  in  the  complaint, it being understood that the real  question sought to be raised by the defense was the one of law presented by the demurrer.</p>
<p>In the case of U. S.  <em>vs.</em> Bacas (14  Phil. Rep., 308), we held that Act No. 1773 does not repeal  the  provisions of article 434.   That  article is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"No penalty shall be imposed for the crime of adultery, except upon a complaint  filed  by the  injured husband.</p>
  <p>"The husband can not institute a  prosecution without including therein both the guilty parties,  if they are  both alive, nor in  any case, if he shall have  consented  to the adultery or pardoned either  of the adulterers."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The contention of the prosecution is that  while  article 434  has  not  been  repealed  and is  still in force with the modification that the crime  of adultery has  been made a public  crime instead of a private one, and can no  longer be pardoned or condoned by the offended party as provided in article 434 of the code;  nevertheless the provisions of article 434 are not applicable to a case where the paramour did not know  the woman to be married.   It  is contended that since the  paramour is not  guilty of the crime of adultery under the provisions of article 433 unless it is  shown that he knew  the woman to  be married, it could not have been the intention of the lawmaker to require the injured husband to file a complaint against the paramour in a case where the paramour did not know of the existence of the marriage, and was not  therefore guilty  of  the crime of adultery.</p>
<p>Reading all these articles and their amendments together, however, we conclude  that the intention of the lawmaker was to deny to the husband the right to prefer a complaint against either the wife or her paramour without including the other therein.  To hold  otherwise would  be to give to the husband the right or  at any rate the power in all cases to condone the offense of the paramour and at the same time to secure tije conviction of his wife; for to secure this end it would only be necessary for the husband to omit from his complaint an allegation that  the paramour knew  of the existence of his marriage with the woman, or,  as in the case at bar, to insert an allegation that the paramour did not know of the existence of the marriage, in order to relieve him from liability  of conviction and punishment, It is not  for the husband to  determine the question of  the guilt or innocence of the paramour of the crime of adultery; that question must be left to the court.  It may be that the complaint having been duly filed, and the control of the proceedings having thereby been placed in the hand3 of the prosecuting officer, he  might move for a dismissal of the complaint as to the paramour if  he were satisfied that he could  not establish guilty  knowledge  on  his part.  But however this may be, we think that the language of article 434 of the code  clearly contemplates the inclusion by the husband of both the wife and her paramour,  if they are both alive, in  the  complaint  upon which he institutes a prosecution for the crime  of  adultery.</p>
<p>The jurisdiction of the court below to hear and determine; a charge of this nature being dependent upon the filing of a  complaint  by the husband, and  the husband being expressly prohibited  from  the  filing of  such a  complaint against one of the parties without including therein the other,  we  are  of opinion that the demurrer filed in the court below should have been sustained.</p>
<p>The judgment of conviction and sentence imposed by the trial court are reversed, with the costs of both  instances <em>de oficio</em>.  The appellant will be set at liberty forthwith and the complaint dismissed.</p>
