				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This cause was commenced by a complaint filed by the provincial fiscal on 
January 12, 1916, in the Court of First Instance of Iloilo, charging the 
defendants with the crime of robbery in a band, accompanied by rape. On the 25th 
of the same month judgment was rendered whereby they were sentenced, Cristeto 
Ledesma and Narciso Castaño, to the penalty of <em>cadena perpetua</em>; Pedro 
Huerva, to that of 14 years, 8 months, and one day of <em>cadena temporal</em>; 
Rufo Tiongco, to that of 12 years' imprisonment, and all of them to the 
accessory penalties, to pay an indemnity equal to the value of the property 
stolen from the offended parties, and each one-sixth of the costs of the trial. 
Alejo Coloso and Jose Ilisan were excluded from the proceedings. The four 
defendants first above named appealed from the sentence.
<p>The facts of the present case are as follows: On or about December 3, 1915, 
in the municipality of Sara, Province of Iloilo, six men, among whom were the 
four defendants, Narciso Castaño, Cristeto Ledesma, Pedro Huerva, and Rufo 
Tiongco, all carrying arms, entered at night the house of Catalina Balinon and, 
employing violence and intimidation upon the inmates thereof, seized and carried 
away with them certain articles of personal use, valued at P357.50 and belonging 
to Catalina Balinon and Rosario Juaneza. In order to obtain an easy entrance 
into the house, one of said defendants wore the uniform of a Constabulary 
private, and another was dressed like a policeman. Upon their arrival at the 
house and after making known that they were there Pedro Huerva, in reply to the 
questions asked him from within, told the inmates of the house that they were 
Constabulary inspectors. The defendants and their two companions were then 
invited to enter. Pedro Huerva and Cristeto Ledesma went in, and the others 
remained outside. When inside the house. Huerva and Ledesma again told the 
inmates that they, these defendants, were Constabulary inspectors and had come 
to search the house to see whether the people living in it had firearms. Then 
they bound the two men they found in the house, an old man and a young man, and 
conducted them below where they were left in charge of the rest of the band, 
while Huerva and Ledesma reentered the house to see whether they could find any 
articles of value.</p>
<p>After the robbers had seized such things as they wished to carry off and when 
ready to go out, they took the three women below blindfolded. The band then 
headed for the river near by to embark in the <em>banca</em> in which they had 
come. When they left the house, Cristeto Ledesma and Narciso Castaño compelled 
two of the women, Juaneza and Eusula, to accompany them, and while the band was 
on its way to the <em>banca</em> these two men separated from the rest, took 
these two women with them to a place near a marsh not far from the river bank, 
and there raped them, employing force and intimidation to accomplish their 
purpose. Cristeto Ledesma raped Rosario Juaneza, and Narciso Castaño, Nieves 
Eusula, after which Cristeto and Narciso went to the <em>banca</em>, where the 
other robbers were waiting for them, and all left.</p>
<p>The facts above related, fully proven in this case, constitute the complex 
crime of robbery in a band, accompanied by rape committed upon the persons of 
two women who resided in the house where the robbery took place. Said crime is 
provided for and punished by articles 502 and 503, No. 2, of the Penal Code, and 
the facts in this case fall within their provisions, inasmuch as the malefactors 
were armed and were more than four men, searched the inside of the house and 
some of its furniture, seized money and various other effects, including 
important documents, all together valued at P357.50, belonging to the owner of 
the house, Catalina Balinon, and Rosario Juaneza, both inmates thereof. Upon 
going out of the building, two of the robbers, Narciso Castaño and Cristeto 
Ledesma, separated from their companions, took with them the said Rosario 
Juaneza and Nieves Eusula to a secluded place near a river not far away, where 
they raped them and, immediately after the commission of these outrages, 
abandoned their victims and rejoined the other robbers, their companions, who 
were awaiting them in a <em>banca</em> moored to the river bank. As the crime of 
robbery, with that of the rape of said two women—a crime against chastity 
committed on the occasion of the robbery—was perpetrated by the malefactors in 
the said house of Catalina Balinon, both crimes should be punished as one single 
complex crime, as defined and qualified by paragraph 2 of article 503 of the 
Penal Code; for, besides the robbers seizing the money and the other effects 
they found in said house, two of them sullied the honor of the two women living 
therein, and the companions of the two men who committed the rape made no 
opposition nor prevented these latter from consummating this other crime, 
apparently unconnected with and unrelated to that robbery, but which, as well as 
sanguinary crimes, is often committed on such occasions, and it is for this 
reason that the penal law, in odium of such offenses against property and 
chastity, has considered them complex and punished them by one single 
penalty.</p>
<p>In the case of a complex crime, like the one here under prosecution, all the 
persons who took part in its commission are identically liable therefor and 
should be punished with the penalty provided in article 503, paragraph 2, of the 
Penal Code. The defendants Rufo Tiongco and Pedro Huerva, who took no part in 
the rape of the women Juaneza and Eusula, cannot be excepted from this penalty 
for the reason that the penal law does not require the condition that the rape 
be committed prior to, or simultaneously with the robbery, it being sufficient 
that this crime be perpetrated on the occasion of the robbery. So the law says, 
in the definition of the crime, that when the robbery is accompanied by rape or 
mutilation caused purposely, all the robbers who took part in the perpetration 
of the complex crime are liable for all the offenses falling within the 
limitation of certain circumstances specified by the law, committed by the 
members of the band.</p>
<p>It is unquestionable that, in the act of the robbery, two of the robbers 
conceived the purpose of raping two of the three women whom they forthwith 
abducted, and that they therefore compelled them go down from the house and took 
them to a secluded site not far from the landing place, where the boat was 
moored, in which boat they had crossed the river on their way to the place of 
the robbery; that against said forcible conduction, the other robbers made no 
remonstrance nor any material opposition to the commission of the crime against 
the chastity and the honor of the two women who were raped. Therefore, the 
defendants Tiongco and Huerva, for the very reason that they are liable for the 
said crime of robbery in a band, are likewise liable for all the other acts 
performed on the occasion of the robbery, although they may not actually and 
materially have taken any part in the rape committed upon those two women by the 
other two defendants, their companions Ledesma and Castaño.</p>
<p>If any of the defendants had wounded or killed an inmate of the house that 
they robbed, all the defendants would, under the law, have been punished for the 
complex crime df robbery with the infliction of wounds or the commission of 
homicide; and, in the present case, because two of the robbers raped two women, 
all the malefactors are liable for the compleex crime in question.</p>
<p>In the commission of the crime, due weight should be given to the attendance 
of the aggravating circumstances of its having been perpetrated at night, in the 
dwelling of the offended parties, in a desolate place, and in a band. There is 
no extenuating circumstance to offset or compensate the effects of said 
aggravating circumstances. Therefore the defendants have incurred the maximum 
penalty fixed by law.</p>
<p>For the foregoing reasons we should sentence, as we hereby do, each of the 
defendants Narciso Castaño, Cristeto Ledesma, Pedro Huerva, and Rufo Tiongco, to 
the penalty of <em>cadena perpetua</em> and to the accessory penalties of 
paragraphs 2 and 3 of article 54 of the Penal Code; and, in case they be 
pardoned from the principal penalty, they shall suffer those of absolute 
perpetual disqualification, subjection to the surveillance of the authorities 
for the remainder of their lives, if these accessory penalties be not remitted 
in the pardon of the principal penalty, and they shall make restitution of the 
stolen articles, or jointly or severally pay the value thereof to the aggrieved 
parties, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, pursuant to 
article 51 of the Code. The defendants Cristeto Ledesma and Narciso Castaño are 
each sentenced to pay an indemnity of P200 to Rosario Juaneza and Nieves Eusula, 
respectively. Each of the four appellants shall pay one-fourth of the costs of 
both instances. The judgment appealed from is therefore affirmed, in so far as 
it agrees with this decision, and reversed, in so far as it does not. So 
ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Johnson, Carson, Araullo</em>, and<em> Fisher, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p>
<p><em>Street, J.</em>, did not sign.</p>
<hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1">

<p align="center"><em><strong>DISSENTING OPINION</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>MALCOLM, J.</strong>, <em>dissenting</em>:</p>
<p>I concur with the judgment in so far as it relates to the defendants Cristeto 
Ledesma and Narciso Castaño. They are guilty as charged, of the complex crime of 
robbery in a band accompanied by rape. I dissent from the judgment in so far as 
it relates to the defendants Rufo Tiongco and Pedro Huerva. They are guilty of 
the crime of robbery in a band not accompanied by rape. Tiongco and Huerva were 
not present at, and did not take any part in, the rape of the women. It seems 
perfectly clear to me that four persons can participate in a robbery, and when 
the robbery is finished, two of them can be satisfied, while the other two can 
only rest content with taking two of the inmates of the house away with them and 
then raping these women. The first two should not be punished for the deeds of 
their comrades. The record also discloses that Rufo Tiongco should be the 
recipient of executive mercy.</p></div>
