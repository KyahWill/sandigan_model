				<H3>CHUN CHONG ON BEHALF OF CHUN LEI AND CHUN KEN, PETITIONER AND APPELLANT, VS. THE INSULAR COLLECTOR OF CUSTOMS, RESPONDENT AND APPELLEE.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">It appears from the record that the said Chun Chong, Chun Lei and Chun Ken 
arrived at the port of Manila on the steamship <em>Loongsang</em>, January 2, 
1917, and requested permission to land in the Philippine Islands. They were 
detained as aliens and their right to land was inquired into by a board of 
special inquiry. Said board, after hearing the evidence decided (<em>a</em>) 
that Chun Chong was a citizen of the United States and was therefore entitled to 
enter the Philippine Islands; (<em>b</em>) that Chun Lei and Chun Ken were 
Chinese aliens, were without the necessary credentials and were not entitled to 
enter the Philippine Islands. From that conclusion, an appeal was taken to the 
Insular Collector of Customs, and the decision of the said board was affirmed. 
Later, Chun Chong, on behalf of Chun Lei and Chun Ken, presented a petition for 
the writ of habeas corpus in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila 
against the Insular Collector of Customs alleging (<em>a</em>) that he is a 
citizen of the United States; (<em>b</em>) that he is the father of the said 
Chun Lei and Chun Ken who were, respectively, of the ages of 17 and 20 years; 
and (<em>c</em>) that the said children were illegally detained and deprived of 
their liberty by the Insular Collector of Customs. To the said petition was 
attached the record made by the Department of Customs.
<p>After a consideration of said record, the lower court reached the conclusion 
that the decision of the Department of Customs denying the admission of the said 
Chun Lei and Chun Ken should be and was affirmed. From that decision, the 
petitioner appealed to this court.</p>
<p>The rule is so well established that no Chinese subject or citizen can enter 
the territory of the United States without what is generally known as the 
"Section 6 Certificate," that the citation of authorities in support thereof is 
no longer necessary. To that general rule, however, there are certain well 
recognized exceptions. Among said exceptions may be mentioned the wife and minor 
children of Chinese residents in territory of the United. States. They may enter 
the territory of the United States without the section 6 certificate. (U. S. 
<em>vs</em>. Gue Lim, 176 U. S., 459; Chua Shun <em>vs</em>. Collector of 
Customs, 28 Phil. Rep., 175; Lee Jua <em>vs</em>. Collector of Customs, 32 Phil. 
Rep., 24; Tan Lin Jo <em>vs</em>. Collector of Customs, 32 Phil. Rep., 78; Gñilo 
<em>vs</em>. Collector of Customs, 32 Phil. Rep., 100; Yap Tian Un (Sun) 
<em>vs</em>. Collector of Customs, 32 Phil. Rep., 487; Du Eng Hoa <em>vs</em>. 
Collector of Customs, 32 Phil. Rep., 490.)</p>
<p>The rule that the courts will not take jurisdiction for the purpose of 
modifying or reversing the decision of the Department of Customs, upon a 
question effecting the right of Chinese aliens to enter the territory of the 
United States until it is conclusively established that there has been an abuse 
of power, authority or discretion by that department, is also so well 
established that we deem it no longer necessary to cite authorities in support 
thereof.</p>
<p>The courts have from time to time attempted to define what would amount to an 
abuse of the power, authority or discretion on the part of the Department of 
Customs. (Ang Eng Chong <em>vs</em>. Collector of Customs, 23 Phil. Rep., 614; 
Lee Jua <em>vs</em>. Collector of Customs, 32 Phil. Rep., 24.)</p>
<p>It must follow from what has been said that the only question presented by 
this, as well as in every other analogous case is; Did the Department of Customs 
abuse its power, authority or discretion in denying Chun Lei and Chun Ken the 
right to enter the Philippine Islands?</p>
<p>Chun Chong claimed (<em>a</em>) the right, which was granted, to enter the 
territory of the United States because he was a citizen of the United States; 
and (<em>b</em>) that Chun Lei and Chun Ken were his legitimate minor sons and 
therefore they also had a right to enter the territory of the United States with 
him.</p>
<p>After hearing the evidence, the Department of Customs reached the conclusion 
that Chun Chong was a citizen of the United States and was therefore entitled to 
enter the Philippine Islands. The Department of Customs denied the right of Chun 
Lei and Chun Ken to enter the Philippine Islands for the following reasons:</p>
<p>(<em>a</em>) That there was a conflict between the testimony given by the 
father and the children with reference to the purpose of their coming to the 
Philippine Islands;</p>
<p>(<em>b</em>) that the father, in coming to Manila, traveled first-class while 
the alleged sons traveled second-class; and</p>
<p>(<em>c</em>) that the alleged children did not resemble the alleged father 
nor each other.</p>
<p>With reference to the first ground upon which the Department of Customs 
denied Chun Lei and Chun Ken the right to enter, it may be admitted that there 
is, perhaps, some conflict in the testimony of the father and the two sons 
relating to their purpose of coming to Manila. The father said that he brought 
his two alleged sons to Manila because he wanted them "to study and learn 
business here." Chun Lei testified that he came to the Philippine Islands "to 
study some business; perhaps he would go to school, that he would work for 
anybody." Chun Ken testified that he was coming to Manila to engage in business, 
and when asked what kind of business he said, "may be to labor or merchant's 
business," that he would do whatever his father told him to do.</p>
<p>Even though it be admitted that there is a slight contradiction in the 
declarations of the father and sons with reference to the purpose of their 
coming to Manila, is the conflict of sufficient importance to discredit and to 
render of no value, in weighing the testimony, when such declarations are 
compared with ttte positive and unequivocal declarations of the father and his 
two alleged sons, that their relation is that of father and sons, and especially 
in view of the fact that the relation of father and sons is supported by the 
positive and undisputed testimony of two other witnesses whose reliability and 
credibility has not been questioned in the slightest degree?</p>
<p>In view of such positive proof and such slight contradictions, was it an 
abuse of authority for the Department of Customs to disregard all of the 
testimony on the question of the relation of Chun Chong and his alleged sons? 
May the Department of Customs, or an ordinary court even, arbitrarily, and 
without giving any reason therefor, disregard positive and uncontradicted 
testimony of witnesses, in reaching their conclusions and expect to be supported 
by reviewing authorities? May the Department of Customs disregard undisputed 
testimony and capriciously reach a conclusion contrary thereto, without giving a 
sufficient reason therefor, and not be held to have abused its power or 
discretion?</p>
<p>In the case of Sing Jing Talento <em>vs</em>. Collector of Customs (32 Phil. 
Rep., 82), as well as in other cases, it was held that "the mere fact that the 
Collector of Customs refused to believe the witnesses presented by the 
appellant, is not of itself an abuse of authority or discretion." (Tan Chin Hin 
<em>vs</em>. Collector of Customs, 27 Phil. Rep., 521; Chin Woy <em>vs</em>. U. 
S., 28 Sup. Ct. Rep., 201; Gñilo <em>vs</em>. Collector of Customs, 32 Phil. 
Rep., 100.)</p>
<p>While that is the undisputed rule, we are of the opinion and so decided, in 
order to avoid capricious and arbitrary rulings, that when the proof upon any 
particular question is direct, positive and undisputed, and when there is 
nothing in the record to show its lack of probity, that the Department of 
Customs, when it does not accept such proof, must give its reasons therefor if 
such reasons do not appear of record. In that way, and in that way only, may the 
reviewing authority have before it the exact data which induced the conclusions 
reached by the Department of Customs, and be able to reach a conclusion that 
parties interested have not been denied a right, by an abuse of authority, to 
which they are justly entitled under the law.</p>
<p>With reference to the second ground, to wit, that the alleged father traveled 
first-class and the alleged children traveled second-class on their trip to 
Manila, upon which the board of inquiry based its conclusion, it may be said 
that that fact does not necessarily, when the family customs of the Asiatic 
Oriental is taken into consideration, discredit the positive declaration of the 
witnesses that the relation of father and sons existed.</p>
<p>With reference to the third ground, to wit, that the alleged sons do not 
resemble the alleged father nor each other, it may be that a physical comparison 
may be made between a minor Chinese, an applicant for admission into the 
territory of the United States, with his alleged father, for the purpose of 
showing parental relationship, providing the fact of such comparison is made a 
part of the record. (Chua Yeng <em>vs</em>. Collector of Customs, 28 Phil. Rep., 
591.) But it does not follow that if there is no resemblance between the alleged 
son and father, that that fact alone would constitute sufficient proof to show 
that the alleged parentage did not exist. The mere absence of parental 
resemblance would not be sufficient reason for declaring that the parentage did 
not exist. Parentage, lineage and legitimacy cannot be made to depend upon 
parental physiognomy or bodily marks of similarity. Such a rule would deprive a 
treat many people of their inheritance. There is scarcely a family among any of 
the nationalities, where there are a number of children, where one or more of 
them, due to heredity perhaps, does not resemble either of their immediate 
parents. Lineage can not depend wholly upon the presence or absence of paternal 
similarity of physical appearance. (Chua Yeng <em>vs</em>. Collector of Customs, 
28 Phil. Rep., 591.)</p>
<p>It certainly cannot be contended, in making such comparison, that if there is 
no resemblance whatever between the alleged son and the alleged father, that 
that fact alone would constitute sufficient proof that the alleged parentage did 
not exist.</p>
<p>Our conclusions are, upon all of the foregoing and a careful examination of 
the evidence, that the proof shows positively, directly and is not disputed by 
any competent and measurable proof of record, that Chun Lei and Chun Ken are the 
legitimate minor sons of Chun Chong and therefore have the right to enter the 
Philippine Islands, territory of the United States, as his minor legitimate 
sons.</p>
<p>Therefore, the judgment of the lower court, as well as that of the Department 
of Customs, ordering the deportation of Chun Lei and Chun Ken, is hereby revoked 
and it is hereby ordered and decreed that said persons have a right to enter the 
territory of the United States, and without any finding as to costs. So 
ordered.</p>
