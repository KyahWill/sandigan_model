				<BR><STRONG>LADD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The defendant in July, 1901,  was connected with  the Police Department of the city of Manila, under the Provost-Marshal-General, his position being that of Chief of  the Secret Service Bureau.   One Marcelino  San Pedro and certain  other  individuals had been  arrested upon suspicion of  being  concerned  in an insurrectionary conspiracy in Pasig, and  it was supposed that San Pedro had in  his possession or under his control arms, ammunition, money, and supplies which had been collected  for the purposes of the movement.  An investigation Avas accordingly  instituted at the police station, and, in the  course thereof, San Pedro having  denied all knowledge  as to the conspiracy, the defendant, for the purpose of compelling him to disclose the whereabouts of the arms, struck him several times with a  whip,  drawing blood, as  we  think the evidence shows, but not injuring him so severely as to incapacitate him from working or to necessitate medical  attendance. Nothing was shown by the defense which can constitute a justification or excuse for the assault.</p>
<p>The complaint was for <em>lesiones menos graves</em>  under article 418 of the Code.   The character of the injuries inflicted was not such  as to bring the case within this article; it falls within article 588,  No.  1, which  punishes as a misdemeanor the  infliction of injuries "which do not prevent the person injured from devoting himself to his customary labors, and do  not require medical attendance."</p>
<p>The defendant was convicted under  article 588, No.  1, of the Penal Code.  This was in accordance with General Orders,  No. 58, section 29.</p>
<p>In the application of penalties in cases of misdemeanor, the  discretion of the court is not controlled by the rules of the  Code as to  aggravating and extenuating circumstances. (Art. 605).  That discretion was, we think in the present case,  properly exercised, the sentence being fifteen days of <em>arresto</em> and <em>reprension</em>, the maximum of the penalty fixed by the law for the offense.</p>
<p>The judgment is affirmed with costs.  Let the  cause be returned to  the  court  below for the  execution of the judgment.                              </p>
<p><em>Arellano, C J., Torres, Cooper, Willard,</em> and <em>Mapa, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em>McDonough, J.,</em> did not sit in this case.</p>
