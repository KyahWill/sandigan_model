				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>I. Don Nicolas del Rosario died in this city on July 14, 1897, leaving a last will, the eighth, ninth, eleventh, and eighteenth clauses of which are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Eighth. The  testator declares that the 5,000 pesos which he brought to his marriage he hereby bequeathes to his nephews  Enrique Gloria y Rosario  and  Ramon del Rosario, natural children of his brother Clemente del Rosario, notwithstanding the fact that they purport to be the issue of the  marriage of Escolastico Gloria and  Rosendo del Rosario, successively.</p>
  <p>"Ninth.  The testator declares that the said sum of 5,000 pesos is to be divided, 3,000 pesos for the first named and 2,000 pesos for the second named, the delivery of the said sums to be effected by the wife of the testator, provided that these young men behave themselves as they have done up to the present time, and do not cease  to study until taking  the degree of bachelor  of arts, and then take  a business course, if their health  will  permit, their support to be paid out of the testamentary estate and they to live in the house of the widow.</p>
  <p>"Eleventh.  The testator declares that in case the said young  men should be still engaged  in  study at the  time of the death  of the testator's wife, they shall continue to be mipported  at  the expense of the testamentary estate., without deducting such expenses from their legacies, if they should desire to continue the same studies.</p>
  <p>"Eighteenth. The testator further states  that although his wife is at the present time fifty-five years of age, and consequently is not likely  to marry again,  as she herself says, nevertheless it is possible  that the opposite  of what she asserts might occur, and, if so, then it is  to be regarded as sufficient reason to authorize the young men Ramon and Enrique, so often referred to, to separate from their aunt, in  which event  they  are to be  supported by the testamentary estate on a small allowance of twenty-five pesos per month, provided that they continue their  studies or should be in poor  health,  this  without  in  any  respect reducing the amount of their shares."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don Ramon del Rosario, one of the persons  mentioned in these clauses,  brought this action in 1902  against Don Olemente del Rosario, the then executor, asking,  among other things, that the said executor pay him an allowance from the death of the  widow of the testator at the  rate of 75 pesos a month, and that the executor allow him to  live in the house in which the widow was living at  that time.</p>
<p>The widow of the  testator, Dona Honorata  Valdez, died on July 7,1900.</p>
<p>The court below  ordered  judgment in  respect to  this allowance, and the right to live in the house as prayed for by the plaintiff.   In this we think that the court erred.</p>
<p>While by the eighth clause the  support  of  the plaintiff and of Don Enrique Gloria is charged against the estate, yet the eleventh  clause makes it  plain  that  this  unconditional  right was to last only during the lifetime of the widow.  After her  death the right to this allowance is made to depend on the continuance of their studies.  That this is the correct construction of the will is made more plain by the  eighteenth clause above quoted.  In the case of their  separation  from their aunt by  her  remarriage, they were entitled to the specified  allowance of 25 pesos a month only on condition that they were  pursuing their studies or were in poor health.</p>
<p>The court  did  not find that the  plaintiff was still pursuing  his studies.   On the  contrary,  he found that  the plaintiff had fulfilled the condition by obtaining the degree of bachelor of arts in 1898.</p>
<p>The right to live in  the house of the widow terminated at her death.</p>
<p>II. The seventh clause  of the will of Don Nicolas is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Seventh. The  testator states that in the present condition of his affairs he has acquired,  during his married life, some tens of thousands of dollars, of which one-half belongs to his wife as her share of the profits of the conjugal partnership, and the other half belongs to him as his share of such profits; but, in view of the agreement entered into between the two spouses,, the property will not be partitioned, and  upon  the death of the  testator all the  said property will pass  to his wife, in order that she may enjoy the  revenue  therefrom during her lifetime, but without authority to  convoy any of  such property, inasmuch as she, being grateful for the benefit resulting to her, binds herself in turn to deliver  said property at her death to the testator's brothers, Don Clemente del Rosario and Don Rosendo del  Rosario, and his sister, Dona Luisa del Rosario,  who shall enjoy the  revenue from the said property during their respective lives, and  shall  then, in turn, transmit the same  to their male children, both those born in wedlock and natural children who may be known."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was later modified by a codicil, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"That in the seventh clause of said testament he desires and wills that in the distribution  of his property and  that of his  Avife among  the male children of his brothers,  Clemente and Rosendo del Rosario,  and those of his sister, Luisa  del Rosario, in such distribution his nephews Enrique Gloria and Ramon del Rosario must be understood to be included, in addition to the legacies mentioned in his said testament."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The thirteenth-clause of his will was as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The testator declares that in case Doiia Luisa del Rosario. should die before or after the  wife of the testator, then the legacy due her by virtue of this will shall not pass in its entirety to her male children, except as to the sum of 1,000 pesos,  the remainder to pass to Don Enrique Gloria Rosario and Don Ramon del Rosario, natural sons of Don Clemente del Rosario, as already stated."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was modified by the codicil as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"That in the thirteenth clause the testator provided that upon the death  of his sister, Luisa del Rosario,  her male children were to inherit from her up to the sum of 1,000 pesos, and this he rectifies, for better understanding, to the effect that it is his will that the remainder of all her portion should be divided into equal parts, one-third to go to his brother Don  Clemente del Rosario  and  the  other  two-thirds to be divided equally among his said nephews, Enrique Gloria and Ramon del Rosario."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dona Honorata Valdez made her will three days after that of her husband.  The seventh clause is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The testatrix declares that she institutes her  beloved husband, Don Nicolas  del Rosario  y Alejo, as her heir to all the property which she may  have at her death, and in the unexpected case of the death of her said husband then she institutes as heirs her brothers-in-law, Don Rosendo and  Don Clemen te del Rosario y Alejo, and  her sister-in-law, Dona Luisa del Rosario, who shall enjoy the usufruct during their lifetime of all the revenue of the said property. Upon the death of any of them, then the property shall pass to the male children of her said brothers-in-law and sister-in-law, the issue of lawful marriage or natural children who may be known; but upon  the death  of her sister-in-law, Dona Luisa, then her share shall  not pass in its entirety to her male children, except the sum of 1,000 pesos, and  the remainder  shall be paid  to  her nephews, Don Enrique Gloria and Don Ramon del Rosario,  natural children of her brother-in-law Don Clemen te del Rosario."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dona Luisa died one year after  Don Nicolas and two years before the death of Dona Honorata, which, as has been said, occurred on July 7, 1900.</p>
<p>Don Enrique Gloria died on July  6, 1900.</p>
<p>Don Ramon del Rosario claims in this action that he is now entitled, by virtue of both wills, to a  certain  part of the share of the estates left to said Doiia Luisa during her life,  and he asks that the defendant be directed to render accounts and to proceed to the partition of the said estates. The  controversy between the parties upon this branch of the case is as follows:</p>
<p>The defendant claims that  the plaintiff is entitled to nothing under the wills, because the gift to him was conditional, the condition being that he should be the natural son  of Don Ciemente, recognized by the latter as such in one of the ways pointed out by the Civil Code; that he can not  prove such recognition, the  parol evidence presented at the trial being prohibited by said Code, and that he has therefore not complied with the condition.</p>
<p>The plaintiff claims that such evidence was proper, that both wills state that Don Ramon del Rosario is the natural son of Don Clemente, and that in any event the bequests are made to the plaintiff by name.</p>
<p>The court below, holding the parol evidence immaterial, ordered judgment for the plaintiff as prayed for.</p>
<p>(1) So far as the disposition of that part of the inheritance left in  the aunt's will to Dona Luisa for life is concerned,  the question  is  free from doubt.  It  is  distinctly declared that Ramon del Rosario and Enrique Gloria shall take certain  parts of it after  1,000  pesos have  been deducted.   They  are pointed out by name as  the legatees. It is  true that they are called  the natural  sons of  Don Clemente.  But this  is merely a  further description of persons already well identified, and, if false, can be rejected in accordance with the provision of article 773 of the Civil Code, whirl) by article 789 is applicable to legatees.</p>
<p>(2) The ninth clause of the will of Dona  Honorata is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The  testatrix bequeaths the sum of 3,000 pesos to her nephews Enrique Gloria and Ramon del Rosario in equal parts—that is, 1,500 pesos each."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The plaintiff was entitled  to one-half of this legacy in his own right.  This has been paid to him.  Don Enrique Gloria died before the testatrix.  By  the provisions of articles 982 and 983 of the Civil Code the right of accretion exists as to the other half in favor of the plaintiff and he is entitled to have it paid to him.</p>
<p>(3) The will of Dona Honorata plainly declares that, on the death  of any one of the life tenants, the male  children of such  tenant shall inherit, and in respect to Dona Luisa it is expressly  declared  that this shall take place whether she dies before or after the testatrix.   The <em>derecho de acrecer</em> did not therefore exist  in favor of the other  two life tenants, Don Clemente and Don Rosendo.  "En la sucesion testa da es ley  preferente la voluntad  del  testador, de modo que este prohibiendo expresamente el derecho de acrecer, nombrando sustitutos, o marcando el destino especial de cada porcion vacante, excluye la aplicacion de los articulos que vamos  a examinar."   (7  Manresa, Comentarios al Codigo Civil, p. 276.)</p>
<p>This right does, however, exist in the share of Dona Luisa in  favor of the plaintiff, for the  reasons  stated in connection with the legacy of 3,000 pesos.</p>
<p>(4) We have passed upon the rights of the plaintiff to the share of Dona Luisa under the will of Dona Honorata, because the interest is expressly left to him (en concepto de legado) as a legacy.   This is controlling.   (5 Manresa, 315.)</p>
<p>These or equivalent  words are wanting in the  will of Don Nicolas. Applying article 668 of the Civil  Code, we must hold that any interest which the plaintiff may have taken in the share of Doiia Luisa under the will of Don Nicolas he took as an heir and not as a legatee.</p>
<p>The distinction between the two is constantly maintained throughout the Code, and their rights and obligations differ materially.   (Arts. 660, 668, 768, 790, 858, 891, 1003.)</p>
<p>(5) The legatee can demand his legacy from the  heir or from the executor, when the latter is authorized to give it. (Art. 885.)   The powers given to the executors by the will of Dona Honorata are contained in the fourteenth  clause, which is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The testatrix appoints as the executors of her will, in the first place, her beloved husband, Nicolas del Rosario y Alejo, in the second place her brother-in-law Clemente del Rosario, in the third place her brother-in-law Rosendo del Rosario,  in the fourth place Don  Ramon del Rosario when he shall attain his majority, all of them without bond and  free from the obligation of terminating the administration within the legal  term.  At her  death they shall take possession of all such goods and things as may be her property, and are hereby authorized fully and as required by law to prepare an inventory of said property, and to effect the division and partition of the estate among her heirs.  She also authorizes them to execute and sign deeds of partition,  sales with a resolutory condition,  cancellations, receipts, acquittances, and such  other documents as may be necessary."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The twenty-first clause of the will of Don Nicolas is substantially the same.  Each will prohibited any judicial intervention in the settlement of the estates.</p>
<p>The clause in the will of Dona Honorata which is a copy of that in the will of Don Nicolas is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The testatrix declares that she expressly prohibits any judicial  intervention  in this her will, although minors, absentees, or persons under disability be interested therein, as it is her wish and will that all the proceedings be conducted extraiudieiallv, and in case a family council should be necessary, she designates the persons who, in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Code now in force, should form such  council, or else leaves their appointment to the discretion of her executors."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the executor was not authorized to pay these legacies, the heirs must pay them.</p>
<p>The life tenants and the heirs who take the remainder under these wills are  numerous.  If they did uot pay the legacies and did not agree upon an administrator, judicial intervention would be necessary, the very thing which the testators had expressly prohibited.   The  important power of making  the partition was attempted to be given to the. executors.   In view of these considerations and a study of the whole will,  we hold that the executors are given power to pay the legacies. The action, therefore, was properly directed against the executor so  far as it related to  the allowance  and the legacy of 3,000 pesos.  As to these legacies, the action may be supported also under article 902, 2, which allows executors to pay money legacies.</p>
<p>It was also properly directed against him, so far as it related to the share to which the plaintiff  is entitled under the will of Dona Honorata in the portion left, to Dona Luisa for life.</p>
<p>The provisions of articles 1025-1027 are no obstacle to this suit.   That an inventory is being formed, or  that the creditors have not been paid, is a matter of defense which should have been set up in the answer.</p>
<p>It was not properly directed against him in so far as it related to the similar share left to him bv the will of Don Nicolas.   He took that as heir and not aw legatee, and the heir can maintain no such action against the executor.</p>
<p>The fact that the plaintiff under the will of Dona Honorata is a  legatee of an aliquot part of the estate, having become entitled to receive one-third of it  on the death of Dona Luisa, does not prevent  him from maintaining this action against the executor.  Though such  a legatee closely resembles an heir, yet, like all other legatees, he must seek his share from the heir or executor.   ( 6 Manresa, 561.)</p>
<p>(6)  While  in  this action he has a right to have his interest as legatee declared, yet it can not be delivered to him without a partition of the estate.</p>
<p>It remains  to  be considered whether the executor has power to  make the partition.  Such power  is expressly given by the will.  This provision is, however, void under the terms of article  1057  of the  Civil Code, which is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The testator may, by.an act inter civos  or causa mortis, intrust the  mere power of making the division after his death to any person who is not one of the coheirs.</p>
  <p>"The provisions of this and  the foregoing articles shall be observed even should there be  a minor or a  person subject to guardianship among the coheirs; but the trustee must  in such  case make an inventory of  the property of the inheritance, citing  the coheirs, the creditors, and the legatees."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don  Clemente,  the executor, against whom the  action was directed,  was not  only an heir as a  life  tenant but also in fee after  the death of  Don  Rosendo if the latter died without issue.  Upon the death of the widow, Dona Luisa then being dead, it  became his duty to divide the estate  into three  parts, or at least  to set off  the third, which  was to  pass  to  the plaintiff  by the  death  of the widow and Dona  Luisa.  In this partition he was directly interested, for, with his brother Don Rosendo, he  had  a life interest in the part of the estate  not set off to the plaintiff.  Article  1057 prohibited an heir  from  being <em>contador</em> for this very  reason,  namely, that  the partition should be made impartially.</p>
<p>Although the executor has no power to make the partition, the heirs can do so.   (Arts.  1058-1060, Civil Code.)</p>
<p>The plaintiff is not bound to remain a coowner with the other heirs.  Being a legatee of an aliquot part, he has the same right to seek a partition  that an heir has.   (7 Manresa,  578; art. 1051, Codigo Civil.)   But in so seeking it he must make parties to his suit all persons interested in the estate (7 Manresa, 577).  This he has not done in this suit, and he consequently  is not entitled to the partition ordered by the court below.</p>
<p>(7) We have held that the only thing that can be decided in this case is the rights of the  plaintiff as legatee. The court below ordered the  executor to render accounts of his administration of both estates.</p>
<p>As to the estate of  Don Nicolas,  the only thing here in question is the right  to the allowance.  As we hold that the plaintiff is not entitled to it, he is not entitled to any statement of accounts as such pretended legatee.</p>
<p>As to the estate of Dona Honorata, he is entitled to be paid  a  legacy of  1,500 pesos.  Article 907 requires the executor to render accounts to  the heir, not to the legatee; and although by article  789 all of the provisions of Chapter II (in which both articles are found) relating to heirs are made applicable  to  legatees,  we  can not hold that this requires an executor to submit his accounts to one who has no interest in the estate except to a money legacy when there is  no suggestion  that it  will not be paid when the right to it is established.</p>
<p>In  respect to the share of Dona Luisa, there is reason for  saying  that a legatee of an aliquot part is entitled to an accounting.  But, inasmuch as in this case there can be no final  determination of  the rights of the parties interested in the estate, because they are not all parties to this suit, the  executor should not in this suit be  ordered to submit his accounts.</p>
<p>(8) The plaintiff  in  his complaint has limited himself to claiming the allowance,  his rights to the share of Dona Luisa, and  the legacies left to him.<br>
  The question as to whether he would be entitled to any part of the share of Don Clemente upon the latter's death, under the seventh clause of the two wills, was not presented by the complaint nor passed upon by the  court and is not before us for decision.</p>
<p>(9)  The result of the foregoing considerations is:</p>
<ol>
  <li> The plaintiff is not entitled to any  allowance under either will.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> He is not entitled to  live  in the house No. 128 Calle Clavel.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> He is entitled to be paid, under the ninth clause of the will  of Dona Honorata, the sum of 1,500 pesos, in addition  to the 1,500  pesos already received under  that clause.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> He is entitled to the share  of  the estate left by the will of Dona Honorata to Dona Luisa during her life, after deducting 1,000 pesos.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> This share can not be set  off to him in this suit, but only in a proceeding to which all persons  interested in the estate are parties.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> His interest in the share  left to Dona Luisa during her life by the will of Don Nicojas can not be determined in this suit.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> The executor can not be required to render in this suit his accounts as such executor.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> The  plaintiff's  rights under the seventh  clause  of the two Avills, to the  share left to Don Clemente for life are not before us for decision.</li>
</ol>
<p>III. After judgment had  been rendered in the court below  and a  bill of  exceptions  allowed,  but  before the record had been sent to this court, Don Clemente del Rosario, the defendant, died.   After his death Don Kosendo del  Rosario, who was  named in  both wills to  succeed to the executorship on the death of  Don Clemente, appeared in the court below and withdrew the appeal and bill of exceptions.  Thereupon the widow of Don Clemente, for herself and in representation of the  minor son of  her late husband,  asked and was granted leave  to prosecute the appeal.</p>
<p>This ruling  was correct.  According  to  the  Spanish authorities, anyone legally affected by the judgment might appeal.   According to the American authorities, if a trustee refuses to appeal, the beneficiary may do so in his name.</p>
<p>That the son of Don Clemente has a direct interest in the question  of the allowance of 75 pesos a month to the plaintiff  is plain.   We have held  that in respect to this allowance the executor represents the estate and the judgment against him binds it.</p>
<p>It would be manifestly unjust to allow an executor, with perhaps only a slight personal  interest in  an  estate,  by withdrawing  an appeal, to fasten upon the estate a claim which, as we hold, it should not bear.</p>
<p>IV. At  the argument  of this  case on the merits, after the appellant had closed, the respondent made the point for the first time that the appellant's brief contained  no assignment of errors.</p>
<p>This is true.   But  a full assignment of errors is found in the bill of exceptions at pages 14 and 15.  The appellee answered the brief of the appellant without making any suggestion of this mistake.   He  has been in no way prejudiced by it,  and we  can not affirm the judgment on this ground.</p>
<p>The judgment of the court below is reversed and the case remanded with directions to the court below to enter judgment in accordance  with this  opinion.  The costs  of this instance  will be equally divided between  the parties. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Cooper, Mapa,</em> and <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em>Torres, J.,</em> did not sit in this case.</p>
