				<H3>EVARISTO  PAYNAGA, PETITIONER AND  APPELLEE, VS. GEORGE N. WOLFE, WARDEN  OF BILIBID PRISON, RESPONDENT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>COOPER, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The petitioner, Evaristo Paynaga, applied to the Hon. B. S Ambler, judge of  the  Court of First Instance, for a  writ of habeas corpus,  and states in his application that he is unlawfully detained and imprisoned by George N. Wolfe, Warden of Bilibid Prison, in the  city of Manila.</p>
<p>On the  5th day of January, 1898, the petitioner  was convicted  and sentenced by  the Spanish authorities to two years' imprisonment for the crime of desertion from the  Spanish army,   He  made his escape on the 18th  day of October, 1898, and was rearrested on the 20th  day of January,  1903.</p>
<p>The answer to the petition and the commitment show that the prisoner had been sentenced by ordinary court-martial to two years' <em>prision correccional militar</em> and that lie should  commence to serve his sentence on January 5, 1898.</p>
<p>The petitioner claims that  he comes  within the  provisions of the proclamation of amnesty and pardon issued by the President of  the  United States on the 4th day of July, 1902, and prays for his discharge under the same.</p>
<p>The judge of the Court of First Instance,  after hearing the  case, decided that   the  petitioner came  within  the amnesty proclamation, and directed that, upon taking the oath of allegiance required by the proclamation, he be discharged from custody.</p>
<p>An appeal has been taken by the Government from  this decision.</p>
<p>It is  contended  by counsel for  the  petitioner  that  Act No. 654, providing for appeals in habeas corpus proceedings, is in the nature  of  an<em> ex post facto</em>  law, and that having  been enacted subsequent  to petitioner's right to petition for habeas corpus, this appeal  should not  be entertained.</p>
<p>In the decision of this court in the case of Frank Mekin vs. George N. Wolfe, rendered  on the  27th  day of March, 1903,1 this question was  passed upon by this court,  and it was there held that habeas corpus is a civil proceeding brought to enforce a civil right,  and  is entirely distinct from the criminal proceedings under  which the prisoner has been tried and convicted, and that the  doctrine of <em>ex post facto</em>  law can  not be applied to the case.</p>
<p>The Amnesty Proclamation grants a full and complete pardon and amnesty to all persons in the Philippine Archipelago  Avho have participated in the insurrection against the authority and sovereignty  of  the  Kingdom of Spain at divers times from August, 1890, until the cession of the Archipelago by  that Kingdom  to  the  United States, and those engaged in the insurrection against the authority and sovereignty of the United States, or who have given  aid and comfort to persons participating in said insurrection, "for the offenses of treason or sedition, and for all offenses political in their  character  committed in  the course of such insurrection  pursuant to orders  issued by the civil, military, or insurrectionary authorities or which grew  out of internal political feuds  or dissensions between Filipinos and Spaniards or the Spanish authorities or which resulted from internal political feuds or  dissensions among  the Filipinos themselves during either of said insurrections."</p>
<p>There is no claim whatever that the defendant participated in either of these insurrections, nor that the character of the  offense  for which he was convicted was  of  the nature embraced in the proclamation.   He was convicted of  desertion,  a violation  of  the  laws pertaining to the military establishment of Spain.</p>
<p>The defendant clearly is not entitled to the  benefits of the Amnesty Proclamation.</p>
<p>It is not a case of this Government trying and convicting a person  charged  with desertion  from  the Spanish army.  The defendant  was convicted during the Spanish sovereignty of the offense of desertion, and is simply serving out his sentence for that offense.</p>
<p>Article XII of the Treaty of Peace between the United States and Spain  provides that  judgments  rendered in criminal matters before the date of the treaty "shall be deemed to be final, and shall be executed in due form by competent authority in the territory within which such judgments should be carried out."</p>
<p>Under this clause of the treaty, it is incumbent upon this Government to execute the judgment in this case.</p>
<p>The judgment of the Court of First  Instance directing the discharge of the prisoner from custody is reversed and the petitioner is remanded to the custody of the respondent, to be kept in his charge until the expiration of the term for which the petitioner has been sentenced.</p>
<p>The costs of proceedings is adjudged against the petitioner.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C.  J., Torres,  Willard, Mapa,</em> and <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em> McDonough, J.,</em> did not sit in this case.<br>
