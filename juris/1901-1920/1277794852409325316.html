				G.R. No. 12648, November 12, 1917</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. SEGUNDO FIRMO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The facts of this case may be briefly stated as follows: 
<p>Luis Antonio is the name of the deceased. Leoncia Arana is the name of his 
Widow (or former <em>querida</em>). Segundo Firmo is the name of the accused, 
the son of Leoncia Arana. The husband and wife on the evening of December 26, 
1915, went to the barrio of Julita, leaving: Segundo Firmo to attend to the 
errands of the house. On the trip Antonio became intoxicated. In this condition, 
on returning to his home, he found Segundo Firmo lying down without having made 
any preparation for the evening meal. This so angered Antonio that he abused 
Firmo by kicking and cursing him. A struggle ensued, during which, Firmo stabbed 
Antonio with a penknife in the left side near the armpit, Luis Antonio died on 
the 13th of January, 1916.</p>
<p>On behalf of the accused, there are presented three lines of defense. Thus, 
it is contended that Luis Antonio died not as a result of the wound but from a 
fever. The answer is that the sanitary inspector, the only medical expert called 
as a witness, testified that Luis Antonio died as a result of the stab wound. 
Again, it is contended that the accused is exempted from criminal responsibility 
because of having acted in defense of his person. The answer is that at least 
one essential prerequisite to this defense is lacking, namely, reasonable 
necessity for the means employed to prevent or repel unlawful aggression. The 
wound was inflicted not in self-defense, properly speaking, but rather in 
retaliation of the abuses inflicted on the person of the accused.</p>
<p>"When an aggression is in retaliation for an insult, injury, or threat it can 
not be considered as a defense but as a punishment inflicted on the author of 
the provocation, and in such a case the most that courts could do would be to 
consider the same as an extenuating circumstance, but never as a cause of 
complete exemption from liability." (U. S. <em>vs</em>. Carrero [1908], 9 Phil., 
544.)</p>
<p>Again it is contended that the wound was inflicted by the deceased upon 
himself. The answer is that this is an improbable supposition and is not borne 
out by the proof. Viewed from every standpoint, we reach the same conclusion 
that the defendant is guilty as charged in the information.</p>
<p>No aggravating circumstances exist. One mitigating circumstance can properly 
be considered, namely, that sufficient provocation or threat on the part of the 
offended party immediately preceded the act. In accordance with the foregoing, 
the defendant and appellant is sentenced to twelve years and one day of 
<em>reclusion temporal</em>, with the accessory penalties provided by law, to 
indemnify the heirs of the deceased, Luis Antonio, in the amount of P1,000, and 
to pay the costs of both instances. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson, Carson, Araullo</em>, and <em>Street, 
JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
