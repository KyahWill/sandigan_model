				<H3>STRACHAN & MACMURRAY, PLAINTIFFS AND APPELLEES, VS. SEGUNDO EMALDI, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The complaint in this  action  alleges that  the original plaintiff is a partnership doing business under the firm name of Strachan &amp; MacMurray, and duly registered in accordance with the laws in force in the Philippine Islands.  The record discloses that an irregular unregistered commercial partnership doing business under the firm name of Strachan &amp; MacMurray sold to the defendant a traction  engine and various accessories; that the members of this partnership were William MacMurray and John Young; and that there is still due and unpaid on this engine the sum of P3,878.50.  Judgment was rendered in favor of William MacMurray and John Young, the individual members of the complaining partnership,  for the amount due the firm, together  with the  costs of the action.  The cause is now before this court upon a duly approved bill of exceptions.</p>
<p>The allegation of the complaint that the firm  of Strachan &amp; MacMurray is a duly registered partnership under the laws in force in the Philippine Islands is not supported by the evidence.  One of the partners,  William  MacMurray, admits that it was not so registered, and it does not appear that the partnership ever was organized in due  form.</p>
<p>Counsel for appellant insists that the plaintiff  in this action being an irregular, unregistered commercial partnership doing  business  under  the firm name of  Strachan &amp; MacMurray, was without juridical personality  to institute or maintain this action.  It appears from the record, however,  that the defendant had a number of business transactions with this irregular  unregistered commercial partnership doing business under the firm name of  Strachan &amp; MacMurray, covering a period of several years.   It further appears that Messrs. MacMurray, Strachan, and Young were at one time associated together in business, with offices at Iloilo.   But the court below,  upon  the pleadings and  the evidence,  found that William MacMurray  and John Young were the actual parties doing business under the firm name of Strachan &amp; MacMurray at the time when the  transaction in question was had, and that they were the real plaintiffs in this action, and entitled to recover judgment upon  the proof adduced at the trial; we must assume, therefore, that although the complaint was not formally  amended, it was taken to be amended  so as to show these parties the real plaintiffs before judgment was actually entered.</p>
<p>If the question of the juridical personality of the plaintiffs  had  been duly  raised  by demurrer or answer, the complaint might have been and doubtless would have been amended,  and such an amendment would properly have been allowed at the couclusion of the trial had a formal motion for that purpose been filed by the real parties plaintiff, who <em>de facto</em>  maintained the action in the court below. If the failure to order a formal amendment was error, it was at most error not prejudicial to the real rights of the defendant, and we do not believe that the judgment should be reversed for a mere technical defect which did not reach the issues, involved, and in  no wise prejudiced the rights of the appellant.</p>
<p>We have frequently held that while an irregular unregistered commercial partnership has no juridical personality as such to maintain a suit and recover judgment in the partnership name, nevertheless the individual members of such a firm may maintain a suit  jointly, and persons dealing with the partnership are estopped from denying the right of the members of the partnership .so to do.   (Prautch &amp; Scholes <em>vs.</em> Jones, 8 Phil. Rep., 1; Yu Bunuan <em>vs.</em> Marcaida, 10 Phil. Rep., 265; Ang Seng Quen <em>vs.</em> Te Chico, 12 Phil. Rep., 547.)</p>
<p>Upon full consideration of the whole case, we find no error prejudicial to the rights  of the appellant,  and hold that the defect in  the complaint assigned as error  by the  appellant was cured by  the proceedings and judgment in  the court below.   The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with the costs of tlie appeal in this instance against the appellant.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Mapa, Johnson,</em> and <em>Trent, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
