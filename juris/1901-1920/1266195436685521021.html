				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The defendants Alejo Ravidas and Narciso Melliza, together with. several other defendants,&nbsp; were tried in&nbsp; the Court of First Instance of Misamis on a charge of insurrection.&nbsp; Both were convicted,&nbsp; and Ravidas was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of five years and Melliza to three years.&nbsp;&nbsp; Both appealed to the Supreme Court from the judgment&nbsp; of conviction.&nbsp;&nbsp; After the case was lodged in the Supreme Court the attorneys for the two&nbsp; defendants named made a motion that they be allowed&nbsp; bail pending appeal, no such motion having been made in the trial court. This&nbsp; motion was heard on November 16, 1903, and was opposed by the representative of the Attorney-General who appeared on behalf of the Government,<p> On November 30, 1903, the court directed the entry of the following order on its minutes:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> "Acting upon the motion&nbsp; of Messrs. Palma,&nbsp; Gerona &amp; Mercado, attorneys for Alejo&nbsp; Ravidas and Narciso Melliza, defendants in&nbsp; the case of the United States vs.&nbsp; Ravidas. et al., that the said defendants be granted bail during&nbsp; the pendency of the appeal in this case before the court, after deliberation:&nbsp; </p><p> "Resolved, by a majority vote, That the motion to admit the said defendants to bail&nbsp; be denied.&nbsp; The Hon. C.&nbsp; S. Arellano, Chief Justice, and Justices Torres, Willard, and Johnson voted to deny the motion."</p></blockquote><p> From the order so entered&nbsp; and the refusal to grant bail Justices McDonough, Mapa, and Cooper dissented.</p><p><br></p><hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;">DISSENTING</span><br><br></div>&nbsp; <br><span style="font-weight: bold;">MCDONOUGH, J.,</span> with whom concur <span style="font-weight: bold;">COOPER </span>and<span style="font-weight: bold;"> MAPA, JJ.,&nbsp;</span><p></p><p> This is a motion to admit the defendants to bail pending the trial of their appeal in this court.</p><p> Bail is usually favored.&nbsp; Before conviction,&nbsp; except&nbsp; in capital cases, it is allowed as a matter of right.&nbsp; After conviction, however, it is discretionary with the Court&nbsp; of First Instance and also with this court to grant or refuse bail in noncapital eases pending on appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp; (See sec. 53, G. O., 58.)</p><p> In several of the States the courts have refused to exercise this discretion unless there exist special&nbsp; circumstances which call for the&nbsp; intervention of the court in behalf&nbsp; of the prisoner.&nbsp;&nbsp; In those States the question has often been raised as to what is a special circumstance which justifies the courts in letting to&nbsp; bail after conviction and pending an appeal. The answers have been numerous, various, and many of them vague.&nbsp; </p><ol><li> In California it was said&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; case of&nbsp; Ex parte Smallman et al.&nbsp; (54 Cal., 35), that it might be a special circumstance&nbsp; warranting the granting of bail&nbsp; when, for example,&nbsp; after a&nbsp; conviction for the crime of felonious homicide and appeal "the deceased" was produced alive.&nbsp; </li>&nbsp; <li> The same court gave as another instance:&nbsp; Where the defendant had been convicted of stealing&nbsp; goods and&nbsp; it turned out afterwards that the goods of which he was convicted of stealing were at the time of the alleged theft&nbsp; in the hands of the owner.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>With all due respect to the learned judge who gave these instances, it may be remarked that these were special circumstances warranting speedy pardon rather than bail. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; </li><li>&nbsp; It was held in Nebraska (42 Neb., 48) that, after conviction and pending appeal, this discretion of the court may&nbsp; be exercised upon the showing of probable error calling for a reversal of the judgment.</li></ol><p> New York&nbsp; State follows this view and, pending appeal and&nbsp; an application for&nbsp; a stay and&nbsp; for bail,&nbsp; the court will&nbsp; look&nbsp; into the record for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not there is probable cause for reversal.</p><p> In&nbsp; Indiana it&nbsp; has&nbsp; been held,&nbsp; on an&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; from the refusal of a judge to admit to bail, the supreme court&nbsp; will weigh the evidence and determine the facts, as if trying the case&nbsp; originally.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Ex-parte&nbsp; Heffernan,&nbsp; 27&nbsp; Ind., 87; Ex-parte Kendall, 100&nbsp; Ind.,&nbsp; 599, and cases cited.)&nbsp; </p><ol start="4"><li> In 3 American and English Encyclopedia of Law, 677, it is said that a special circumstance&nbsp; justifying bail, after conviction, is where the defendant voluntarily surrendered; or&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; </li><li> Where he is a man of large means; or&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; </li><li> Where he refused an opportunity to escape; or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; </li><li> When the defendant is seriously ill; or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; </li><li> When the hearing on the appeal has been unnecessarily delayed.</li></ol><p> Thus it appears that the exceptions are so numerous that they almost constitute the rule.</p><p> The discretion to let to&nbsp; bail conferred on this court is to be exercised&nbsp; regardless of the action of the Court of First Instance.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even in California, where it frequently happened that the trial court refused to exercise the discretion vested in it to let to bail, the supreme court, in&nbsp; the case of Smith (89 Cal., 80), rebuked the court below&nbsp; for failure to act.&nbsp;&nbsp; "The fact," said the learned judge of&nbsp; the supreme court who wrote the opinion, "that the trial court adopted an inflexible rule not to admit a defendant to bail who has been convicted of a felony,&nbsp; can have no weight with us, however inconsistent such rule is with section 1272 of the Penal Code" (allowing the court to&nbsp; exercise discretion). "This court passes upon the merits of the petition presented to&nbsp; it <em>regardless&nbsp; of any action or rule&nbsp; the trial court niwy have&nbsp; adopted"</em></p><p> In&nbsp; the case of Hodge (48 Cal., 3) the chief justice of the supreme court allowed bail&nbsp; after it&nbsp; had been refused by the court below. There the defendant had&nbsp; been convicted of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to do bodily injury.&nbsp;&nbsp; The punishment for&nbsp; that&nbsp; offense&nbsp; was a fine&nbsp; or imprisonment,&nbsp; and the&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; had been sentenced to serve a term of imprisonment of eighteen months in the State prison.</p><p> On the argument, the attention of Chief Justice Wallace was called to the record, and he evidently examined the record and the rulings of the court below and the charge to the jury, for he said:</p><p></p><blockquote> "It is not proper that I should intimate an opinion as to the ultimate determination of the points&nbsp; which it&nbsp; is the purpose of this appeal to present for the judgment&nbsp; of the supreme court.<p></p><p> "They are sufficient in my&nbsp; judgment to show that the appeal is <em>bona fide</em> and that&nbsp; the case made is not to be characterized as frivolous or unsubstantial.</p><p> "I think that should I, under the circumstance, refuse to admit the prisoner to bail, it would be a misapplication of the discretion conferred by the statute.</p><p> "The right to, appeal to the supreme court is guaranteed by the Constitution to the prisoner and is as secure as the right of trial by jury.&nbsp; It is one of the means&nbsp; the law has provided to determine the question&nbsp; of his guilt or innocence.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon&nbsp; such an appeal the&nbsp; ultimate&nbsp; question&nbsp; is nearly always&nbsp; as to the validity of the judgment&nbsp; under which&nbsp; the prisoner is to suffer, and it is&nbsp; certainly not consonant to our ideas of justice, if it can be prevented by legal means,&nbsp; that, even while&nbsp; the <em>question of&nbsp; guilt</em> or innocence is yet being agitated in the form of an appeal, the prisoner should be <em>undergoing the very punishment</em>&nbsp; and suffering the very infamy which it was the lawful purpose of the&nbsp; appeal to avert.&nbsp;&nbsp; It would be somewhat akin to a practice of punishing the accused for his alleged&nbsp; offense while the jury was yet deliberating upon a verdict."</p></blockquote><p></p><p> These are sensible and weighty reasons for the exercise of the discretion of the court to let a prisoner out on bail pending his appeal, but weighty and just as they may be&nbsp; in California, there is much more reason for following them in these Islands, because here the accused&nbsp; is not finally tried until his case is heard,&nbsp; retried, and determined by this court, which, in case of conviction, sentences the accused&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; full term prescribed&nbsp; by law; and he&nbsp; is obliged to serve the full term of imprisonment imposed upon him by this&nbsp; court, without being credited with the time served in prison, between the time of determining his guilt below and the time of conviction here, except where convicted&nbsp; of certain minor offenses&nbsp; in which&nbsp; the convict is credited with half the time served pending the appeal. So&nbsp; that&nbsp; this may&nbsp; result, especially if&nbsp; delay occurs&nbsp; in bringing the case to trial in this court,&nbsp; and in deciding the same, that an accused may have to serve a longer term in prison than is prescribed by the Code.</p><p> Moreover, in&nbsp; the&nbsp; State courts,&nbsp; the accused is allowed bail as a matter of right before conviction by a jury in noncapital cases.&nbsp; The conviction, under our system, in a Court of First Instance, where an appeal has been taken, is very like an examination&nbsp; and a holding for&nbsp; trial by a committing magistrate in the States, if the holding&nbsp; of this court in the case of the United States <em>vs</em>. Kepner (1 Off. (Gaz., 353) be good law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; In the opinion of this court in that case,&nbsp; it is&nbsp; stated, under&nbsp; the Spanish rule in these Islands: "There never was any finality to the judgment of the trial court, in felony cases, until it had been ratified and confirmed by the court of last resort.&nbsp; Such a judgment was merely advisory to the appellate tribunal. *&nbsp; * * That was the law of the land when&nbsp; the change of sovereignty took place, and it has only been modified since to the extent of making the judgment of the Court of First Instance,&nbsp; in felony cases (except capital&nbsp; offenses)&nbsp; final, <em>unless</em> an appeal lias been taken either by the Attorney-General or the accused.&nbsp; So then, so now."</p><p> Inasmuch as there has been an appeal taken in the case at bar, the&nbsp; judgment below, therefore,&nbsp; is not final; it is not such a judgment as is entered in the&nbsp; States upon&nbsp; the verdict of a jury; it is&nbsp; in its nature "merely advisory," and, therefore, it, together with the double&nbsp; punishment mentioned above, constitutes a special&nbsp; circumstance entitling the&nbsp; defendants to&nbsp; the&nbsp; exercise&nbsp; of the discretion of the court in their favor.</p><p> It seems&nbsp; to me&nbsp; that&nbsp; this&nbsp; court&nbsp; ought to&nbsp; follow&nbsp; the practice of&nbsp; the Federal&nbsp; courts and that&nbsp; of the Supreme Court&nbsp; of the United States, and not&nbsp; deny bail&nbsp; after conviction unless some special circumstance exists which&nbsp; appeals especially&nbsp; to the discretion of the court, but&nbsp; rather to allow&nbsp; bail, unless&nbsp; some&nbsp; great urgency exists&nbsp; which would&nbsp; make it manifestly improper to grant the petition.</p><p> Thus&nbsp; in&nbsp; the case of McKnight&nbsp; (113 Fed. Rep.,&nbsp; 451), decided&nbsp; by the circuit court of appeals of the sixth circuit, 1902, it&nbsp; was held that the United States Court of Appeals, pending a&nbsp; writ&nbsp; of error, had power,&nbsp; and that it was <em>generally its duty </em> to.admit to bail, after&nbsp; conviction of a crime not capital; that where the trial court refused to admit to bail pending a writ of error, in the absence of some great&nbsp; urgency, a further application should be&nbsp; made to the appellate court, and that the fact that the defendant had been three times convicted on&nbsp; the same indictment, for embezzling funds of a national bank, was not sufficient ground for denying bail pending a writ&nbsp; of error.</p><p> In the case of Hudson <em>vs.</em> Parker (156 U. S., 277) it appeared that Hudson&nbsp; had&nbsp; been convicted in the United States district court for the western district of Arkansas, of assault with intent to kill,&nbsp; and was sentenced to imprisonment for a&nbsp; term of years.</p><p> A writ of error was granted by one of the justices of the supreme court (not assigned to that circuit)&nbsp; and an&nbsp; order made for supersedeas and bail, in a sum named, pending the writ, the bond to be approved&nbsp; by Judge Parker, the district judge.&nbsp; He, however, refused to approve the&nbsp; bond, holding that the supreme court judge was without authority to let the prisoner to bail.</p><p> In the opinion&nbsp; of the supreme court it&nbsp; was said&nbsp; that: "The statutes of the United States have been&nbsp; framed&nbsp; upon the theory that a person accused of a crime <em>shall not,&nbsp; until he is finally adjudged guilty in&nbsp; the court of last resort,</em> be absolutely compelled to undergo imprisonment or punishment, but may be admitted to&nbsp; bail not only after arrest and before trial, but after conviction and pending a writ of error," and&nbsp; so the court&nbsp; ordered a mandamus&nbsp; to be issued commanding Judge Parker to take action regarding the approval of the bond.</p><p> For&nbsp; the foregoing reasons I am of opinion that the defendants should be let to bail pending the disposal of&nbsp; their appeal in this court.<br><br><br></p><p></p><hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 1 Phil.
