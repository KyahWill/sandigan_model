				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C. J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The following conclusions in the decision of the court below are in accord  with the records in the case:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The defendant, Antonio Agaludud, together with other parties,  was engaged on the afternoon of  December 13, 1904, in cutting palay in a field in the barrio of Lasien of the pueblo of Badoc.</p>
  <p>"The  deceased (Tomas  Ladera), a  lieutenant in  the police force of the pueblo of Badoc, armed with a revolver and accompanied by some  men, went  to the said field, having perhaps an interest in both the field and the palay, and there stopped the said cutting of palay, then  disarmed the defendant and his companions of their bolos, insulted and maltreated  them, 'seized all of  the palay cut  and collected by the  men that  day  and  on  the  day before, stored the palay  in  a house, and assisted by  his friend, Hilarion Ba単aga,  took  by  force the  defendant,  Antonio Agaludud, the  chief of the  gang, to the pueblo that same evening.  Lieutenant Ladera, the deceased, explained that it was His purpose to call on the teniente del  barrio  and the councilman  to have  them certify as to the storing of the palay.</p>
  <p>"The  defendant, perhaps  fearing death at the  hands of his captors, or  moved  by  a spirit  of revenge toward Lieutenant Ladera  for  the ill treatment received, drew a knife and stabbed Ladera in the breast and then took to flight, while he was being  escorted by Ladera and his friend, Hilarion Ba単aga, on the road to the pueblo through the  forest on a dark night.  Two reports from  a  pistol were heard and Ladera died shortly after as a result of the  stabbing."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From  the testimony of the two witnesses, one for the prosecution  and the other for the defense, there arises an evident fact  The witness for the prosecution is Hila- rion Ba単aga, the only eyewitness to the struggle  between the  defendant and Lieutenant  Ladera, and who is,  more- over friendly to the latter, according to his own testimony, and Laureano Calacay, a sergeant of police, witness for the  defense, who in the afternoon in question had gone to the aforementioned field in obedience  to an order from Lieutenant  Ladera,  of  whom  he is a relative.   Accord- ing to Calacay, the defendant had repeatedly asked Ladera not  to take  him to  the  pueblo  as it was nighttime, and had  also begged his  pardon.  That Ladera, however, con- tinued to force the defendant to follow  him, stating that he, Ladera, was not a bad man, and that finally the lieu- tenant threatened to bind his hands.  The defendant then decided to proceed  (f.  35).  According to  Ba単aga, the party having already started on the march, the lieutenant ordered one of the men to return to the field  for his  horse and  inform  the sergeant that he too should  go to the pueblo, "and after this  we continued on the  march to the pueblo,  when  the defendant again turned and  faced Lieutenant  Ladera, saying: 'Do have mercy on me, sir, for  I  believe you are taking  me  into  the forest.   The lieutenant pushed the defendant and told him to continue on as  we had to reach  the pueblo.  After the push, the defendant again  begged for compassion, stating at the same time his fears of  being killed  on the way.   The lieutenant answered that he was not in the habit of killing persons,  and  with this  continued pushing the prisoner onward.  Again the defendant  turned to  the  lieutenant and  begged for mercy, but he also struck  at the lieutenant at the same time; as soon  as I  saw this, for I was  back of the lieutenant, I rushed forward against the defendant, but lie ran away.  Lieutenant Ladera called out  to  me to  follow  and capture the defendant,  for he was badly hurt."</p>
<p>All these arbitrary acts executed by Lieutenant Ladera before starting on the trip to the pueblo, those executed during the said trip, and the personal  violence committed against the defendant, with  manifest viciousness and  re- currence, in the  face of the defendant's supplications and protestations of fear for his life once arriving at the forest, constitute in  the highest degree an  illegal aggression, which was by no means provoked by the defendant in the case at bar,  who did finally  repel the aggression, but in doing  so he employed unjustifiable means,  as it is not shown that the means adopted were reasonably warranted.</p>
<p>We  are therefore of the opinion  that the defendant's conduct  is palliated  by the  circumstance of his having acted in self-defense, but  all  of the requisites  necessary to exemption  from criminal liability are not attendant.</p>
<p>We  therefore sentence  Antonio Agaludud  to prision correctional  for two years four months and  one day, in accordance with  the  first paragraph of article  9 of the Penal  Code, and to further  indemnify  the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P1,000,  or to suffer subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the  costs of both instances.   So ordered.</p>
