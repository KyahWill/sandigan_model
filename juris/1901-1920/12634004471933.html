				G.R. No. 2914, November 28, 1906</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. ANTONIO GAVIRA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is a prosecution for <em>estafa</em>.  The defendant having been convicted in the court below, appealed to this court, where the case was duly argued and submitted,  counsel for the accused having shown that the latter did not commit  the crime with which he is charged.  And in fact he did not.  The five persons who delivered to the defendant the 10 pesos  in question, each contributing 2 pesos for the purpose of procuring their <em>cedulas</em> for the year 1903, and who  were given memorandum  receipts for the  amount thus  paid, were not injured  in any  way.  They paid the price of their cedulas on the 8th of February, 1904, and on the 6th of  April  of the  same year each received his <em>cedula</em>.</p>
<p>But these  10 pesos were not paid into the provincial treasury either in the month of February or March when the accounts of the municipal treasury of which  the defendant was  in charge were examined, nor in the  months of April or May.  It was in  the latter part of May when the payment  to the defendant of the 10 pesos in question by the five persons above referred to was discovered by a deputy of the provincial treasurer who seized a stub book which the defendant had at his house. These are  the  facts in the  case, and the Attorney-General  is of the opinion that the  defendant should be acquitted  of  the charge of <em>estafa</em> with the costs <em>de oficio</em> without prejudice to the filing of  a new complaint for embezzlement of public funds.</p>
<p>The judgment of the court below is accordingly reversed Mnd  the defendant acquitted with  the costs of both instances <em>de oficio.</em> After  expiration of ten days  from the rendition of final judgment the case will be remanded to the Court of  First Instance for execution.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres,  Mapa, Johnson, Carson, Willard,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
