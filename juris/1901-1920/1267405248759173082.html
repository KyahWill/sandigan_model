				<BR><STRONG>MORELAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Manila 
convicting the accused of the crime of estafa and sentencing him to four months, 
and one day of <em>presidio correctional,</em> to payment of costs of the 
action, and to indemnify the firm of Successors of C.Fressel &amp; Co. in the 
sum of P1,036.11, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency.
<p>It is charged in the information in this case: "That on or about the 31st day 
of January, 1913, in the city of Manila, P. I., the said Rosendo Villareal, 
having prior to that date as an agent of the firm of Successors of C. Fressel 
&amp; Co., a copartnership duly organized and doing business in the city of 
Manila, P. I., received several amounts for the purchase of native hats, from 
which amounts on the date above stated, there was a balance in his possession of 
P1,036.11, which the said Rosendo Villareal had received on deposit, commission 
or administration from the said firm, Successors of C. Fressel &amp; Co., to 
wit, for the purpose of buying native hats for the said firm of Successors of C. 
Fressel &amp; Co., the said defendant did then and there wilfully, unlawfully 
and feloniously misappropriate, misapply and convert to his own use the said sum 
of P1,036.11, to the damage and prejudice of the said firm of Successors of C. 
Fressel &amp; Co. in the said sum of P1,036.11, Philippine currency, equivalent 
to 5,180 and 11/20 pesetas."</p>
<p>We are of the opinion that there is not sufficient evidence to sustain the 
conviction. It appears from the testimony introduced on the trial that the firm 
of Successors of C. Fressel &amp; Co. was engaged in the purchase and export of 
native hats of various styles and qualities. Thus engaged it procured the 
services of the accused in this case to purchase hats of the individual makers 
found engaged in that business within a certain area and to sell them to the 
company. It was the custom among the hat makers at that time to have advanced to 
them by their purchasers money sufficient to pay for materials and help. The 
defendant having no money to make these advances and to pay for the hats which 
he had engaged to purchase, certain sums were at various times advanced to him 
by C. Fressel &amp; Co. In return for the advances the accused at various times 
sold and delivered to the company quantities of hats at an agreed price. In the 
course of time and just prior to the commencement of this prosecution a 
liquidation of accounts resulted in disclosing the fact that the accused was in 
debt to Fressel &amp; Co.for money advanced in the sum of P1,036.11.</p>
<p>It appears from the testimony of Brokman, the manager of Fressel &amp; Co., 
as well as from the testimony of the accused, that the money advanced to the 
accused by Fressel &amp; Co. was in the nature of a loan and not a delivery of 
money to be used for a particular purpose or to be returned. Brokman testified 
that they purchased hats from the defendant at the price which they could agree 
upon; that an account was kept of the debits and credits of the accused in which 
he was charged with the sums of money advanced and credited with varying 
quantities of hats which he delivered to them; that the sum of P1,036.11 which 
appears as the balance in favor of the company did not represent any particular 
or designated sum of money advanced to the accused' but was obtained by 
subtracting from the total of the sums advanced the total purchase price of the 
hats delivered. The accused testified that the money which he had from the 
plaintiffs was received as a loan which was charged to his account and which he 
promised to repay in hats which he proposed to sell and deliver to them. He 
admitted that he owed the sum above mentioned but denied that he had used any 
money obtained from the company for his own purposes as alleged, declaring that 
the sum represented the losses which he had sustained in the business occasioned 
by two causes; First, the neglect or refusal of certain hat makers to whom the 
accused had advanced considerable sums of money to deliver to him the hats for 
the purchase price of which said sums had been delivered; and, second, the 
company at various times during their commercial relations refused to pay the 
accused the price which he asked for the hats and compelled him to sell them to 
it at a considerable loss. This evidence is uncontradicted, and being 
corroborated, as it is, by other evidence in the case, we are constrained to 
find that the accused has not violated any criminal law and should be 
acquitted.</p>
<p>The judgment of conviction is reversed and the accused acquitted.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Carson,</em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.,</em> 
concur.</p>
