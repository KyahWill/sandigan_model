				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The plaintiffs brought this action in the Court of First Instance  of  the Province of Ilocos  Norte,  asking  for  a permanent injunction against the defendants, prohibiting them from cutting off water which irrigated the lands of the plaintiffs.   Judgment was entered in the court below in favor of the defendants and the plaintiffs have appealed.</p>
<p>Litigation, arose  prior to 1874 between  the grantors of the plaintiffs and the grantors of the defendants over the right to use the water here in question.  A final judgment in one of those cases  was entered on the 11th day of September,  1874.  It was therein decided  that the defendants in that case, who were the grantors of the plaintiffs in this case,  had a  right  to irrigate  their lands in Padong by means of the opening made, or which ought to  be made, in the dam belonging to the then plaintiffsj who were the grantors of the  present defendants, with the  obligation on the part of the then  defendants to assist in  all the work which was necessary  in order to confine the waters in the channel from the principal branch of the river to the dam in question.   The appellees on page  33  of their brief,  in speaking  of this judgment, make the following statement:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"It is true that according to the decision of September, 11, 1874, Exhibit A of  the defense,  the  appellants are entitled to water their land in Padong by means of an opening made in the ditch belonging to Bonoan and Valdes and their  respective wives, toward the sitio of Rengat, such as they were doing in former years before their separation in 1902;  but this  right depends always upon a  condition which consists in the  plaintiffs' sharing in the work stated above, an  obligation which the aforesaid judgment imposed on  them.   Therefore, it  having been  proven herein  that since  1902 the plaintiffs and their tenants had voluntarily desisted and without any reason known to the defendants and their companions, had taken no part in the work of maintaining and conducting the water of the Rivers Burnay and  Maliblibeg  for  the  irrigation of  the  land in Pudong, they have forthwith lost said right because they failed to comply with said condition or obligation."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The plaintiffs allege, and as is seen the defendants admit, that this judgment determined the rights of the parties in respect to the use of the waters  here in  question.  It gave the present plain tiffs the  right to take the water, but imposed upon  them the duty of assisting in the work necessary to bring the waters to the lands of both parties. It was said in the judgment of  1874 that the River Burnay had two  branches, one which  led to the lands  of Agunit and the  other to  the  lands in  Padong, in which  latter place  are found the lands of both  the plaintiffs and the defendants.  The Rivers Burnay and Maliblibeg join at a place  called Sinigpet, some 2,500 meters above the place where the plaintiffs took the water in Padong.  After this union,  the stream  ran in  places in two branches until it finally divided, as has been above stated, one branch leading toward Agunit and the other  toward Padong.   In order to prevent all  of the water flowing toward  Agunit it  was necessary that the plaintiffs and defendants  maintain dams and other defensive works upon that part of the river between  Sinigpet  and their property.  The evidence in the case shows  that  these defensive works were swept away  or  damaged  at  every  freshet or  rise in  the river, and that it was necessary to repair them many times during the year.  One witness testified  that an examination  was made of the upper  course of the river twice a week.   This is the  work which is  referred to in the decision  above quoted, and is the work in which  the plaintiffs by that decision were compelled to take part.  They did so until 1902.</p>
<p>It is cleanly  established by the evidence  that in  1902 and 1903 the plaintiffs did nothing, toward the maintenance of these works, but took the water which they used during those years from another place.</p>
<p>The claim of the defendants, and the holding of the court below, was to the effect that by failing to take part in the work for 1902 and 1903 the plaintiffs forfeited their right to enjoy the water in thefuture, even if they did participate, or offer to, in  the repair work for subsequent years, and the only question in the  case is, What effect upon  the rights of the plaintiffs did  their failure to take part in the work for the years 1902 and 1903 produce?</p>
<p>There  is  considerable evidence in the case relating to the custom or agreement  among the parties as to  the penalty imposed for a  failure  to be present  when  the work was done. Most of the witnesses testified that there was imposed upon the person who was absent a fine of 25 <em>centimos</em> for each day  of  his absence.   One witness  testified,  and  his evidence seems reasonable,  that if  one of the party of the defendants was absent, his companions of the same party imposed the fine upon him and so, if one of the party of the plaintiffs was  absent, his companions among the plaintiffs imposed the fine upon him.  If all of the party of the plaintiffs  or all the defendants failed to be present, then the other party deprived  them of  the use of the  water for the day on which they  were absent. There is no evidence whatever in the case to indicate that a failure of one person  to assist in the work for one day, or for any length of time, deprived him perpetually of  the use of the  water, nor is there any evidence to show that if all of the plaintiffs failed to assist at any particular time they thereby forfeited forever their aforesaid rights.</p>
<p>It is to be presumed that during the years 1902 and 1903, when the plaintiffs  were absent,  they were deprived of the water.   That the plaintiffs  in 1904  offered to assist in the repair work  of that year, and asked to be allowed to take the water as before, and that the defendants refused to permit them the use of  the water and constructed  the dam mentioned in  the complaint in such a way as to cut the water off from the plaintiffs, are facts established by the evidence.</p>
<p>In our opinion it can "not be held that the failure of the plaintiffs in 1902 and  1903  to assist in  the work of these years deprived them perpetually of the rights which they had enjoyed.  When in 1904 they offered to take part in the necessary work of that year, it was the duty of the defendants to permit them to do so and to allow them the use of the water as they had used it since 1874.</p>
<p>It seems from the judgment  of 1874 that the litigation in  that case arose as it did  in this, from the failure of one of the  parties to  take part in  the necessary work of repair.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs made no allegation  in the complaint as to the amount of damages which they have suffered, by the acts of the defendants.  At  the trial, however,  they introduced some evidence upon  this point.  That evidence is not sufficient to warrant any recovery in this respect.</p>
<p>The judgment of  the court below is  reversed,  and judgment is entered in favor  of the plaintiffs  and against the defendants,  ordering that the defendants let the water flow, by removing the dam or such part thereof as obstructs the course of the same, with obligation on the part of the plaintiffs to assist in all the work which is  necessary in order to confine the waters in the channel  from the principal  branch of  the river to the dam in question, with the costs  of  the first instance.  No costs  will be allowed to either party in  this  court.  So ordered.</p>
