				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The defendant was  prosecuted in the  court below for a violation of ihe second paragraph of  section 24 of the Internal Revenue  Law  of  1904 (Act No.  1189).  He was convicted and  sentenced to pay  a fine of 500 pesos and to suffer imprisonment at hard labor for eight months.  From this judgment  he appealed  to this court.</p>
<p>There is practically but one  disputed question of fact in the case.   Three Chinese went to the defendant,  who was then  municipal treasurer of the town of Pitogo, in the  Province of Tayabas,  for the purpose of procuring licenses  to smoke opium.   The  defendant,  as such treasurer, issued to each one of  these  Chinese a  license and, as they testified,  required them  to pay for such licenses 6 pesos and 20 centavos each instead of 5 pesos,  the price fixed by law.  That each one of the  Chinese then paid 6 pesos and 20 centavos is not disputed,  but it is claimed by the appellant that he received only  5 pesos; that 20 centavos was paid to the municipal secretary for a revenue stamp, and that 1 peso was paid to the municipal secretary as a fee for writing the application for the license.</p>
<p>Act No. 1461, section 2, provides: "Upon the presentation by  any  Chinese person  of a written  application  duly verified by his oath before an officer entitled to administer oaths," the municipal  treasurer  shall issue a certificate authorizing him to smoke opium.. The Internal Revenue Bureau had furnished to the defendant, as municipal treasurer, printed  blanks.   Each one of these blanks contained on the left-hand end a printed application.   In the middle of the paper was the certificate of the officer administering the oath and  on the right-hand  side was the license itself. The defendant filled  out not only the license but also the application at the other end of the paper, had the Chinese sign that,  and he himself administered the oath,  and so certified.   It  is very apparent  that  this is all  that was required to be done by the law.  The only application that was required  to be presented was the application printed on the same piece of paper on which the license was printed. The defendant in his  testimony,  however, claimed that that is an improper construction of the law.   He said that the law required the application to be in writing and that this application was printed, and,  in the second place, that the law required the applicant  to present his application to the treasurer and that, if the printed form was such application, it could not  be presented to the treasurer because he already had it in his possession.   Acting, as he says,  upon this construction of  the law, he required each one of these Chinese to procure some one to make a:  formal written application  for license, and  the municipal secretary testified that he wrote out an application for each one of these Chinese,  certified to it, and required each one to procure a revenue stamp of 20 centavos, and that  lie was paid by each  one for his services  1 peso.  The certificate which the municipal secretary attached to each one of the applications stated that the Chinese had appeared  before' the secretary  with a  personal cedula and a certificate  of residence such as is  required of Chinese.  Act No. 1461 requires no such certificate, nor does that or any other law, as far as we know, authorize the municipal secretary  to make any such certificate.   The treasurer, before he issued the license, could inform himself of these facts and  he did not need the aid of the municipal secretary for that purpose.  The latter's certificate  Avas entirely worthless.</p>
<p>The construction placed upon the law by the defendant is entirely inadmissible, and it is very  evident  that these Chinese were imposed upon by some one  and were  compelled to pay more than the law required.</p>
<p>The only question in the case is, whether they paid the 1 peso and 20 centavos to  the municipal secretary or to the defendant.  On this point the three Chinese testified positively  that they paid the money to the treasurer.  The judge so found and with this decision upon the question of fact we are entirely satisfied.</p>
<p>The principal argument of the defendant in  this court is to the effect that he acted in good faith upon his construction  of the law  and that he, therefore,  can  not  be convicted.   The evidence convinces us that the treasurer, as well  as the municipal secretary, knew that  there was no necessity  whatever for these applications  which were presented.  Being a man of ordinary  intelligence, the defendant could not have believed that any application other than the printed one  found upon the  license itself was necessary.   The judgment  of the court  below is modified by striking out the words "hard labor."  In other respects it is affirmed, with the costs of this instance  against the appellant.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C.J., Torres, Johnson, </em>and <em>Tracey,  JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
