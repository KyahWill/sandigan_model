				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of the Moro Province, Hon. Herbert D. Gale presiding, convicting the accused of the crime defined and punished in section 1 of Act No. 619, and sentencing each one of them to ten years&nbsp; in prison and a fine of P20,000, to subsidiary imprisonment&nbsp; in&nbsp; case&nbsp; of&nbsp; insolvency,&nbsp; and&nbsp; to pay&nbsp; one-fourteenth part of the costs.<br><br>It appears f from the proofs adduced&nbsp; by the Government that on&nbsp; Sunday, the 6th of June, 1909, at about 10.30 o'clock at night, twenty-three&nbsp; of the soldiers composing the Second Company of&nbsp; Constabulary stationed at&nbsp; Davao mutinied. During the progress of the mutiny they shot Lieut. Antonio de Goicuria, one of the officers of said company, wounding him in&nbsp; the left leg.&nbsp; Having thrown off all control, they started&nbsp; to&nbsp; flee from the locality.&nbsp; For this purpose they divided&nbsp; themselves into two groups, one passing along Calle San Pedro and the other&nbsp; along.Calle Magallanes in said village.&nbsp; The group which&nbsp; passed along Calle San Pedro encountered Lieutenant De Balaine of the Constabulary and the governor of the district, Mr.&nbsp; Walker,&nbsp; at whom they fired several shots.&nbsp;&nbsp; The soldiers thus mutinying, among whom were the fourteen appellants in this case, were&nbsp; under the leadership of Serg. Manuel Rodriguez, one of the appellants, and one Serg. Felix Academia.&nbsp; Having passed through the city in this manner, the two. groups united at the Davao ford and, crossing the river, marched to the mountains of Lipadas, where they remained&nbsp; until the 8th day of said month of June, on which date they returned and attacked the village of Davao.<br><br>That the appellants in this case mutinied against their superior officers in the manner described is unquestioned. Those of the accused who testified in their own behalf admitted the fact.&nbsp; So clear is the&nbsp; case that a detailed discussion&nbsp; of the facts would be idle.<br><br>No general defense was presented by the appellants,&nbsp;&nbsp; Two or three, among them Manuel Rodriguez, asserted that they were forced to join the&nbsp; mutineers&nbsp; by Sergeant Academia, who seized&nbsp; them&nbsp; and under&nbsp; threat to kill them&nbsp; compelled them to go with him.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is substantially nothing inv the evidence which justifies such defense.&nbsp;&nbsp; Every act&nbsp; of those who set up such&nbsp; defense is distinctly in contradiction to the allegations.&nbsp;&nbsp; That the&nbsp; appellants each and every one were&nbsp; guilty of mutiny, voluntarily and willfully, is so clear from&nbsp; the record as&nbsp; to make it entirely useless to&nbsp; detail the proofs.&nbsp;&nbsp; The defendants generally,&nbsp; while not offering a defense, present as&nbsp; an excuse for the mutiny the abuse tp which they&nbsp; had been severally subjected at the hands&nbsp; of their superior&nbsp; officers, including Lieutenant De Goicuria, whom they assaulted and&nbsp; shot during the&nbsp; mutiny.&nbsp;&nbsp; That they were treated harshly and were abused&nbsp; to some extent is unquestioned. Under all of the facts of the case, however, we&nbsp; are of the opinion that&nbsp; such&nbsp; treatriient ought not&nbsp; to weigh in favor of the appellants.&nbsp;&nbsp; They had&nbsp; within&nbsp; their power a method by which such abuses could be&nbsp; corrected and this is the course that they should have followed.&nbsp; Their conduct during the&nbsp; mutiny, and the acts of spoliation and murder committed&nbsp; subsequent thereto, leave no&nbsp; room for leniency.<br><br>For these reasons, the judgment appealed from is affirmed, with the costs against the appellants.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J,, Mapa, Carson,</i> and <i>Trent, JJ.</i>,&nbsp; concur.<br></div>
