				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On the 8th day of 13eptem]ber, 1903, the municipality of Cavite, through its president, Catalino Nicolas, presented a petition  to the Court of Land  Registration asking that it be inscribed as the owner of a certain tract of land containing  193.29 square meters, situated in the Paseo de la Soledad, within the  said municipality.  On  the 25th of January, 1904, Maria Jose", Irene Jose,  and Macario  Jose" filed  amended objections  to the granting of the petition, alleging  that  they were the owners of the land described therein.   This case was numbered in that court 155.</p>
<p>On the 24th of October, 1903, the said Maria Jose, Irene Jose", and Macario Jose" presented a petition to the Court of Land Registration asking that they be inscribed as the owners of seven separate and  distinct tracts of land situated within the Province of Cavite.  The seventh parcel of land is the parcel described in the petition in case No. 155.  Upon this tract  of land there stands a building known  as the "Kiosko Cafe."  The sixth  tract of  land described in the said petition is also situated in the Paseo or Plaza de la Soledad, and there stands upon it a building called the "Cavite Theater."  This  case was numbered in the Court of Land Registration 240.  On the 17th day of December, 1903, the municipality of Cavite filed an objection to the petition of Maria Jose and others so far as it related to the tract on which the theater stands.  In case No. 240 the prayer of the petitioners was granted as to all the tracts of land therein described  except those tracts on which stand the theater and the Kiosko Cafe.  As to those tracts this case,  No. 240, was tried with case No. 155,  in accordance with the  law,  and one decision  was rendered for both cases.  The  court below held that Maria  Jose, Irene Jose, and Macario Jose were the owners of the land and buildings in controversy, having acquired title thereto by prescription,  and entered a judgment denying the inscription asked by the municipality as to the land occupied by the  Kiosko Cafe and ordering the inscription of both tracts of land in favor of the petitioners, Maria Jose and others.   The  municipality moved for a new  trial on the ground that the evidence did  not justify the decision and that motion  having t&gt;een  denied, they brought the case here by bill of exceptions.</p>
<p>The evidence shows, and the court below so found, that at the time the Kiosko Cafe  and the theater were built, they were built upon a public street or square known as the "Paseo o Plaza de  la Soledad."</p>
<p>As to the  theater, the evidence shows  that it was constructed by Esteban Jose, the father of the petitioners, in 1885 or 1886.  The petitioners claimed that it was so constructed by virtue of a concession made to Esteban Jose by the then politico-military governor of Cavite, and proof was presented to show that the document evidencing this concession  had been delivered by the petitioners to  the authorities of the quartermaster department of the United States Army, some time in 1900, that department being the lessees then of the theater, and that it had been lost.  Parol evidence of the contents of this document was then received. Assuming that the evidence is sufficient to show that there was a license issued, it is not  sufficient to show that any grant of the  land itself was made by the governor to Esteban Jose.  The property being a public street or square, the burden of proof was upon the petitioners to show' that it had ceased to be such public street or square by reason of some action taken by competent authorities to that end. No such proof was made and the claim of the petitioners must, therefore, rest upon the  statute of limitations.</p>
<p>Assuming, without deciding, that the statute of limitations is applicable to this case,  the evidence nevertheless, is not sufficient to show that the petitioners are entitled to the benefit thereof.  Neither they nor their ancestor were or have been  in possession of the land for thirty years.  In order to show title by prescription it is, therefore, necessary for them to prove that they occupied this land for ten years under color of title and in good faith.   The license given by the governor,  its terms not  appearing and it not being shown that it was a grant of the land, could not constitute color of title.   Esteban Jose", therefore, during his lifetime was not  occupying under  color of title.  He died on the 24th  day of  October,  1892, and the petitioners then acquired, by virtue of being his heirs, all  the interest which he had in the property. They had occupied the land for ten years from the 24th of October, 1892, before their possession was legally interrupted  by the municipality.  There was no proof that they were not occupying in good faitlj and the court below held that the transmission to them of the rights of their father by his death constitutes color of title,  and they having occupied for ten years under color of title, and in good faith, became the owners of the land by prescription.</p>
<p>We think the court erred in holding that the transmission of the interest of Esteban Jose by his  death to  his heirs constituted color of title.   The cases cited by  the court below decided by the supreme court of Spain in support of that view are judgments of the 1st of May, 1858, and the 4th of October, 1862, but that  court, by judgments of the 21st of June, 1864, the 16th of November, 1871, and the 3d of October, 1878, held to the contrary and declared that the transmission of rights to  heirs  by the death of the ancestor did not constitute color of title for the purposes of the statute of limitations.  It appears in this case that there was no partition of any kind among  the heirs of the property left by Esteban Jose" until the 10th of July, 1904.</p>
<p>As to the Kiosko Cafe, it appears that that was constructed about 1885  by Pedro Oliva.  There  was some testimony as to a license or concession given to him for that purpose by the  then  politico-governor  of Cavite, but w^hat has been said  in regard to the concession granted for the construction of the theater applies to the concession granted for the.  construction  of this Kiosko Cafe.  As it does not appear what the terms thereof were, it can not be said that there was any grant of the land upon which the building stood.  In 1886  or 1887 Pedro Oliva transferred to Esteban Jose his rights in the building, but it does not appear that he transferred to him any interest in the land itself.   Therefore, neither the license given to Oliva nor the transfer by Oliva to Esteban Jose constituted  color of  title, and  Esteban Jose prior to his death, was not holding the land under color of title.  It is admitted by the municipality that the buildings belong to the petitioners.</p>
<p>The petitioners, Maria Jose et al., not having shown any grant of the land and not having shown  that they have acquired title thereto by prescription, are  not entitled to have the land  registered in their  names.  The judgment ordering such registration must, therefore,  be reversed.</p>
<p>The question remains as to whether the  municipality is entitled to have  the  land upon which the  Kiosko Cafe stands registered in its name.   Article 344 of the Civil Code is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Property for public use in provinces and in towns comprises the provincial and town  roads, the squares, streets, fountains, and public waters, the promenades, and public works 'of general  service supported by the said towns or provinces.</p>
  <p>"All other property possessed by either is patrimonial, and. shall be governed by the provisions of this code, unless otherwise prescribed in special laws."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The land in question,  upon  which this Kiosko  Cafe" stands, being dedicated to public use, we do not think it is subject to inscription  by the municipality.  Article 25 of the regulations for the execution of the Mortgage Law prohibits the  inscription of  public  streets in  the old registry.  Public  streets  are not <em>bienes patrimoniales </em>of the municipality so long as they are destined to public use.</p>
<p>On January  12,1904, the Philippine Commission passed Act No. 1039, section 3 of which is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The following public  lands and buildings in the said municipality of Cavite are hereby granted  to the said municipality:  (1)  The undedicated portion of the paseo extending from the north end of Calle  Isabela Segunda, passing the statue of Columbus, to the northwest salient, to be kept open as a public thoroughfare;  (2)  the northwest salient; (3) Soledad Square; (4)  the isthmus leading from  Porta-Vaga gate  toward San Boque, to be kept open as a public  thoroughfare; (5)  the southwest salient."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We do not think that this act intended to convert Soledad Square and the other  places mentioned  in the  act which are to be kept open as public thoroughfares into <em>bienes patrimoniales</em> of the municipality so as to  entitle the said municipality to, have the said  Soledad Square  registered in its name as owner thereof.</p>
<p>The judgment of the court  below ordering the inscription of the lands described in  paragraphs  6 and 7 of the petition of Maria  Jose et al.  is hereby  reversed and the case is remanded with instructions to the court below to dismiss the  petition so far as it relates to these tracts of land.   The judgment of the court below  denying the petition of the municipality of Cavite is affirmed but upon the ground that the property in question being  a public square is not subject  to  inscription.  No costs will be allowed to either  party in this court.  After the expiration  of twenty days from the date  hereof let judgment be entered in accordance herewith and ten days thereafter let the case be  remanded  to the court below for proper  action.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J.,  Torres, Mapa, Johnson Carson,</em> and<em> Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
