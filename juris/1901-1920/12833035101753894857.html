				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The information filed in this case charges the defendant and appellant with 
the crime of falsification of a private document committed as follows:
<p>"That in or about the month of December. 1913, in the city of Manila, 
Philippine Islands, the said Tomas F. Barreto did, willfully, unlawfully, 
criminally and fraudulently falsify a private document, to wit, a pawn ticket, 
No. 11, 830, issued by the 'Monte de Piedad y Caja de Ahorros de Manila,' an 
institution duly organized and doing business in the city of Manila, Philippine 
Islands, and did make in the said pawn ticket the following alterations or 
changes:</p>
<p>"He erased the name "Tomas Barreto,' which had been written in the upper part 
of the pawn ticket, and substituted therefor the name of 'Valentin Aguirre,' He 
changed the words 'eight pesos' (the amount for which, according to the said 
document, certain jewels had been pawned) for the words 'one thousand, two 
hundred pesos;' the figures 'P10' (which, in the said document, indicated the 
amount of the valuation of the pawned jewels) for those of 'P1,600;' and the 
words 'an American five the following words: "An 18 carat gold finger-ring, set 
with a brilliant of ordinary size, and a pair of 18 carat gold ear-rings, set 
with two brilliants of ordinary size and 16 small brilliants;' whereby it was 
made to appear in the said document that an 18 carat gold finger-ring, set with 
a brilliant of ordinary size, and a pair of 18 carat gold ear-rings, with two 
brilliants of ordinary size and 16 small brilliants, both articles appraised at 
P1,600, Philippine currency, had been pawned in the said establishment for the 
sum of of P1,600, Philippine currency, by a person named Valentin Aguirre, when 
as a matter of fact and as the said accused very well knew, the article pawned 
was only an American five dollar gold piece, valued at P10, and that it was 
pawned for P8, not by Valentin Aguirre, but by the accused himself, Tomas F. 
Barreto—acts committed with intent to injure a man whose name is unknown and to 
whom the said Tomas F. Barreto delivered the said pawn ticket as security for a 
loan, and to prejudice the said 'Monte de Piedad y Caja de Ahorros de Manila.' 
In violation of law."</p>
<p>The accused having pleaded "guilty" was forthwith convicted and sentenced, 
and thereupon appealed to this court, and now makes the following assignments of 
error in support of his contention that the judgment of conviction should be 
reversed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"First error.</em>—The court erred in holding that the crime of 
falsification of a private document was committed, notwithstanding that the 
place where the crime was perpetrated was not alleged in the complaint nor 
proven at the trial. </p>
<p><em>"Second error.</em>—The court erred in holding that the crime of 
falsification of a private document was committed, notwithstanding that the true 
name of the certain person against whom the attempt was made to cause the 
alleged injury, was omitted from the complaint and was not proven at the 
trial."</p></blockquote>
<p>As to the first error assigned it should be sufficient to say that the 
information expressly charges the defendant with the falsification of a private 
document in the city of Manila, Philippine Islands—that is to say, within the 
jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila in which the 
accused was tried; and that, having pleaded "guilty" of the commission of the 
crime as charged in the information, that plea was an express admission of the 
truth of this allegation. The contention of counsel would seem to be that the 
information was defective, in that it fails to set forth expressly the place 
where improper and illegal use was made of the falsified document, an allegation 
which counsel for appellant insists was absolutely essential for the proper 
determination of the court clothed with jurisdiction over the alleged offense. 
But under the definition of the crime of falsification of a private document as 
set forth in article 304 of the Penal Code, the offense in consummated at the 
time when and at the place where <em>the document is falsified to the prejudice 
of or with the intent to prejudice a third person</em>, and this whether the 
falsified document is or is not put to the improper or illegal use for which it 
was intended. It is evident, therefore, that the place where the crime if 
committed is the place where the document is actually falsified, and that the 
improper or illegal use of the document thereafter is in no wise a material or 
essential element of the crime of falsification of a private document; and even 
if it were otherwise, the charge that the crime was committed in a specific 
place would seem to be a sufficient allegation that all of the acts necessary to 
its consummation were in fact done at the place indicated.</p>
<p>As to the second alleged error it should be sufficient to indicate that the 
information charges that the offense was committed with intent to prejudice not 
only an unknown person, but also the institution known as the <em>Monte de 
Piedad y Caja de Ahorros de Manila</em>. But even if no reference were made to 
the <em>Monte de Piedad</em>, it would be a sufficient compliance with the terms 
of the statute to allege that the crime was committed with intent to prejudice a 
third person, name unknown. Article 304 of the Penal Code is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Any person who, to the damage of another, or with the intent to cause such 
damage, shall in any private document commit any of the acts of falsification 
enumerated in article three hundred shall suffer the penalty of <em>presidio 
correccional</em> in its minimum and medium degrees and be fined in a sum not 
less than six hundred and twenty-five and not more than six thousand two hundred 
and fifty <em>pesetas</em>."</p></blockquote>
<p>Under this definition a conviction of the crime of falsification of a private 
document may be sustained upon proof that the falsification had been made with 
intent to injure a third person, even though the name of that person be unknown. 
Counsel for appellant seems to rest this assignment of error pupon the erroneous 
theory that no criminal prosecution can be instituted or maintained in these 
Islands in the absence of a private complainant; and counsel contends that if 
the injured party is unknown, it must be presumed that such unknown person did 
not file a sworn complaint.</p>
<p>In support of his contention counsel relies upon our rulings in the case of 
United States <em>vs</em>. Municipal Council of Santa Cruz de Malabon (1 Phil. 
Rep., 731) wherein we held that a criminal complaint was property dismissed in 
the course of a preliminary investigation, it not appearing that the complainant 
had been or might be injured by the commission of the act denounced as a crime. 
An examination of that opinion discloses, however, that it goes no farther than 
to deny the right of a private citizen to institute a criminal prosecution for a 
public crime in any case wherein it does not appear that he has been or may be 
injured by the commission of the alleged offense. In the language of the 
syllabus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Under the criminal procedure established by General Orders, No. 58, the 
right to commence criminal prosecutions is confined to the representatives of 
the Government and to the persons injured by the crime complained 
of."</p></blockquote>
<p>The proceedings in the case at bar rest upon an information filed by the 
public prosecuting officer, and there can be no question as to the authority of 
such officers to institute and maintain a criminal action without regard tot he 
intervention of the private persons who may have been directly injured by the 
commission of the alleged offense, excepting prosecutions for the offenses 
formerly designated private offenses which by express provision of law can only 
be instituted at the instance of the offended party.</p>
<p>Subsection 5 of section 6 of General Orders No. 58 expressly provides that a 
complaint or information is sufficient if it shows—"The names of the persons 
against whom, or against whose property, the offense was committed, if known." 
From this express provision of the statute it may fairly be inferred that where 
the name of such person is unknown, an information should not be deemed 
insufficient because of a failure to set forth his name therein.</p>
<p>We find no error in the proceedings prejudicial to the rights of the 
appellant, and the judgment convicting and sentencing him should, therefore, be 
affirmed, with the costs of this instance against him. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Trent</em>, and <em>Araullo, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Moreland, J.</em>, concurs in the result. </p></div>
