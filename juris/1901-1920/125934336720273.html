				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> At the  hearing on October 8, 1902, of the motion of Jurado &amp; Co., dated September 11, 1902, the attorney for the Hongkong and  Shanghai Banking Corporation  challenged the competency of  one of the judges of this court to sit in the  case, for having acted as fiscal.</p>
<p> The application of article 8 of the Code of Civil  Procedure, now in force, to a challenge directed to the  competency of a judge of the Court of First Instance is free from doubt. But when the challenge is to the competency of the judge of this court the article may admit of two constructions.   Under  one  construction the  magistrate decides for himself  the question of  his competency; his decision is conclusive, and the other members  of the court have no  voice  in it.   Under the other construction the magistrate challenged sits with the court and the question is decided  by it as a body.</p>
<p> We adopt this second construction as  the  proper  one. We can not admit as possible a third construction under which the court would decide the question, excluding from the  consideration of it the members challenged.   This construction would,  if adopted, put it in the power  of a party to  stop all proceedings in the cause by  challenging three of the justices.   The court has examined  the original documents referred to at the argument, and we find nothing in them to support the challenge or which expresses an opinion on  the merits of the casa  Inasmuch as the complaint of the fiscal had for its purpose the compelling of the judge to comply with the law, and as this officer had failed to send up the report which he had been directed to make in accordance with the complaint of the fiscal,  now a Justice of this court,  the latter simply  made a written request that the judge be directed to  send in this reportâ€”a mere matter of procedure.</p>
<p> In accordance with article 8 of the Code of Civil Procedure in force the challenge should have been made in writing, but it  appears to the court more convenient to settle the question on the merits, and for the reasons stated the challenge is not allowed and the hearing of  the motion will be continued on Monday next.</p>
<p> <em>Torres, Cooper, Mapa,</em> and <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p>  <em>Arellano, C. J.,</em> withdrew from this case.</p>
