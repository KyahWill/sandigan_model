				<h4>
				G.R. No. 11474, March 29, 1917</h4>
				<H3>PASIG STEAMER AND LIGHTER COMPANY, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. VICENTE MADRIGAL, DEFENDANT, AND THE MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY AND MANILA NAVIGATION COMPANY, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MORELAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Without going into the facts of this case in detail the court is fully 
satisfied that the Manila Railroad Company was negligent in the handling and 
care of the lighter in question, and that it must, therefore, respond to some 
one for the damages which resulted from its negligence.
<p>The lighter was rented by the plaintiff to the defendant Madrigal and by him 
sublet to the Manila Railroad Company and lost while in its possession. The 
trial court dismissed the action as to Vicente Madrigal but held the Manila 
Railroad Company liable. The plaintiff appealed from that portion of the 
judgment dismissing the complaint as to Madrigal and the Railroad Company 
appealed from the judgment entered against it in favor of the plaintiff.</p>
<p>We are of the opinion that the judgment dismissing the complaint as to 
Madrigal must be reversed. He is liable to the plaintiff upon his general 
obligation to return the property in as good condition as when received, natural 
wear and tear excepted; unless, of course, it was destroyed by an act of God, 
something not claimed in this case.</p>
<p>As between the plaintiff and the Railroad Company, the former is entitled to 
a judgment against the latter on the principle of representation, and such 
liability is expressly declared by article 1550 of the Civil Code.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from in so far as it dismissed the action as to Vicente 
Madrigal is reversed and judgment is hereby entered against him for the sum of 
P4,000 with interest from the 7th day of October, 1914. No costs. The judgment 
rendered is understood to be against Madrigal and the Railroad Company jointly 
and severally.</p>
<p>We are not authorized under the pleadings to make any pronouncement as 
between Madrigal and the Railroad Company.</p>
<p>The judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against the Manila Railroad 
Company is affirmed, with costs. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Carson, Trent</em>, and <em>Araullo, JJ.</em>, concur.</p></div>
