				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, COMPLAINANT  AND APPELLEE, VS.  FREELAND MCCRAY, DEFENDANT  AND APPELLANT.

				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On December 18,  1902, an information was  filed by the provincial  fiscal in the Court of First  Instance of Batangas, charging Freeland McCray with the crime of homicide, in that, at  about 10  o'clock at night on the 17th of December, 1902, in the course of a quarrel with one John  King in the house of a man named Harvey, located in the town of Batangas, capital of the province of the same name,  he fired several shots at King with a revolver, inflicting upon him three wounds, two of which were mortal,  causing his death within a few minutes.</p>
<p>The testimony of the  Army  physician  who held the autopsy on the  body  is  to the  effect that the deceased received one  bullet  in the left side, the  ball penetrating the  left lung, and another in the back,  near the liver, perforating the stomach, and that he sustained a third superficial  wound on the left  forearm.   The  physician stated that in consequence of the first two wounds, which  were necessarily fatal, King expired shortly afterwards in the hospital to which he was taken.</p>
<p>The facts stated constitute the crime of homicide,  John King having died as a result of the wounds inflicted  upon him with a revolver in the course of the  quarrel with the defendant, Freeland McCray.  The evidence does not disclose the existence of any qualifying circumstances which would justify the classification of the crime as murder and the imposition of the corresponding penalty, as the wound in the back of the deceased was due not to the first shot fired by the  aggressor but to a subsequent shot fired in consequence  of a similar assault  on  the part of the deceased.</p>
<p>The defendant, McCray, pleaded not guilty and alleged that  he killed the  deceased  in  self-defense.  However, notwithstanding this exculpatory  statement, two eyewitnesses affirm that while the accused, McCray, was in  Harvey's house,  John King arrived there, and that after an altercation between them McCray  went out into the yard, challenging King to come out and engage in a  fist  fight with him.  King remained in the house, held back by the witness Holland, and did not answer.  McCray then re-entered the house, whereupon one Purple seized him by the arms and pushed him  toward the kitchen,  in  order to prevent his approaching King.   The latter thereupon drew his revolver  and fired at McCray. He then endeavored to leave the  house; but McCray, who had  been wounded in the right  side of the neck, as shown by the testimony of the physician who examined him, in turn drew his revolver and shot at King.   The latter managed to make his way into the yard of the house, the two continuing to fire at each other until King, who had gone into the street, fell to the ground.</p>
<p>The witness William Scott, who  was also present at the occurrence, testified to the same effect, although he  said that the first shot which he heard  was fired while he was standing with his back toward the combatants.  He states, however, that it was fired at King, and be therefore believes that the accused, McCray, was the  aggressor.  This statement of Scott is contradicted by the testimony of the two other witnesses  who were present at the occurrence.</p>
<p>The accused in his sworn testimony stated that he and the deceased were friends and lived in the same house, but that in consequence  of  some trouble  between them  concerning a woman he had gone to live in another house, as he knew that whenever King made his mind up to do a thing he always endeavored to carry it out; that it is true he had an altercation with King in the house in question and that he challenged the deceased to a fist fight, which ' challenge King did not accept; that upon returning to the house and  while  he was  prevented by  Purple from approaching King, the latter, with the remark that he was going to kill him, fired two shots at him, and that on this account he in turn fired at  King.</p>
<p>The evidence  in the record is contradictorv.   Two witnesses testify that they heard King  say in  the hospital, before dying, that he had fired three times and that he was the one Avho fired the first  shot.  Two other  witnesses, however, testify that they  heard King say, shortly before expiring, that the defendant, McCray, was  the one who fired the first shot.   The  judge below, on January 3 of the current year, convicted the defendant and condemned him to ten years of <em>prision mayor</em>, with the accessory penalties, and to the payment of costs.</p>
<p>The crime of homicide having been proven and the defendant, McCray, having  admitted that he  was the one who caused the violent death of John King, it only remains for ,us to decide whether in the commission  of  the crime there was  in effect  a complete exemption from criminal responsibility on the ground  of self-defense, or merely an incomplete exemption.</p>
<p>Of the three requisites prescribed by article 8, section 4, of the Penal Code, it is evident in this case that  there was an unlawful aggression on the part of the deceased, John King, who fired  two shots  at the defendant, McCray, one of which wounded him in  the neck.   It  can  not be questioned that this aggression  was entirely unlawful, as there was no motive or reason which could possibly justify it.</p>
<p>The witness Scott, when testifying that he believed the attack was commenced by the defendant,  McCray, and not by King, gave as a reason for his belief the  fact that he heard a firearm discharged behind him and at King.  John L. Woodruffe and B. Harviner, two other witnesses, testify that they heard King say, shortly before his death, that it was  McCray  who fired the first shot; but against the testimony of these witnesses we have that of the witnesses Chapell and Haywood to the contrary;  that is, they testify that they heard King  say it was he who fired the first shot, and this statement is corroborated by the  testimony of two eyewitnesses to  the affray; and it must therefore be considered as proven that the  assault was commenced by King.</p>
<p>Upon this supposition it is  undeniable that  the accused had a right to defend himself  against the unlawful  attack upon him, and which put his  life in imminent peril, particularly  when it is considered  that he had already been wounded  by one  of the two shots fired at him by the deceased; and hence it follows that there was a reasonable necessity  for the  employment  of a weapon similar to that used by the assailant, for the purpose of impeding or repelling  the attack of the latter.</p>
<p>With respect to the third requisite of lack of  provocation on the part of the person assaulted, the evidence discloses that this circumstance in favor of the  defendant does  not exist.  It is a fact fully proven in the record that McCray had repeatedly challenged the deceased to fight and that, the challenge not having been accepted, he  again entered the house in an aggressive attitude  and endeavored to approach  King, but was prevented from doing so  by  the witness Holland,  who seized him by the arms  and pushed him  toward  the  kitchen.  It  is evident, therefore, that provocation was given by the accused.  Consequently, there being present only two of the  three requisites established by the criminal law for complete exemption  of criminal responsibility, the accused can avail himself  of only  the incomplete exemption granted by section 86 of the  Penal Code.  The penalty  to be  imposed upon the accused is therefore  that immediately inferior to  the one prescribed for the  crime of  homicide, and  should be imposed  in its medium grade.</p>
<p>For the reasons stated we are of the opinion that the judgment  appealed should be  affirmed, with a reduction of the penalty, however, to eight years and one day of <em>prision mayor</em> and the accessories of suspension from all public office and the right of suffrage during the period covered by the penalty, to the payment of 1,000 Insular pesos to the heirs of the deceased, and to the costs of both instances.</p>
