				G.R. No. 948, March 09, 1903</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE, VS.  MACARIO CALLOTES, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>LADD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The evidence shows that on the evening of September 11, 1901, six armed men entered the  convent of the pueblo of Bagoc, Bataan, intimidated the family of Calixto Tiangco, who was living in  the convent at the time, and  took and carried away a small sum of money, a revolver, some provisions, and other articles belonging to Tiangco, and a hat which belonged to  Ildefonso Batol.</p>
<p> The defendant admits that he was with the bandits when the convent was robbed,  but claims that he had been sequestrated by them.</p>
<p> Batol's hat was found in  the possession of the defendant when he was  arrested.  He says he took  it from one of the bandits when he separated from the band.   He also admits that he had a revolver, which was given to him by Isidro  Mendigoren, the leader of the band, and which he turned over to one Munti,  from whom it appears to have been recovered  by the  inspectors.  It does  not appear whether or  not this revolver was the one taken  from the convent.</p>
<p> The defense of sequestration is a familiar one  in these cases, and is of such a character as not to be entitled to much  consideration unless supported by strong evidence. Not only is there here no evidence that the defendant was an involuntary member of  the band, except his own assertion to that effect,  but the circumstance that the leader of the band allowed him to carry a revolver strongly discredits any such theory.  We can entertain no doubt as to the defendant's guilt.</p>
<p> There was  no evidence as to how the bandits effected an entrance into the convent.  The conviction under article 508 of the Code can  not, therefore, be supported.  The defendant is  convicted  of the  crime defined in No. 5  of article 503 in connection with article 504, with the  aggravating circumstance of article 10, No. 20, and  the penalty fixed at ten years of<em> presidio mayor</em>, with costs.  In other respects the  judgment is affirmed, and the cause will  be returned to the Court of First Instance for the execution thereof.   So ordered.</p>
<p> <em>Arellano, C. J., Cooper, Willard,</em> and <em>Mapa, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
