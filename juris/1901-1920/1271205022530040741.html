				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This case involves a claim of intervention under title of ownership for the 
recovery of possession of a lot and a warehouse erected thereon which were sold 
at public auction by the sheriff of Nueva Ecija as though they were the property 
of Paulino Mendiola, which, according to the plaintiff intervener, they are 
not.
<p>The facts that occurred are the following:</p>
<p>On May 9, 1904, the said sheriff publicly announced that on June 2 of the 
same year he would sell at public auction, pursuant to a judgment rendered by 
the justice of the peace of Cabanatuan against Paulino Mendiola and his 
property, a lot and a warehouse situated in Sumacab of the said municipality. 
The description of the property is given in the notice and corresponds with that 
contained in the complaint; it is therefore regarded as correct and here 
reproduced, for there is no question as to the identity of the property then 
sold and now demanded (Exhibit 4). At the auction Emilio Vergara was the highest 
bidder and the lot and warehouse were knocked down to him. This was on June 2, 
1904, the date announced for the sale (Exhibit 6). On February 10, 1906, Emilio 
Vergara sold the said lot and warehouse acquired at auction to Maria Romares 
(Exhibit 5); and the latter, in turn, sold them, on December 29, 1910, to Jose 
Aquino, their present possessor (Exhibit 7).</p>
<p>From Exhibits 1 and 2 it is seen that in 1906 the lot was still assessed as 
being the property of Paulino Mendiola.</p>
<p>The record in this case shows the following evident facts; (1) That as far 
back as 1895 the said lot was recorded in the property registry of Nueva Ecija 
in the name of the spouses Marcelino Gatchalian and Ciriaca Pascual, its owners, 
who, on December 18, 1894, had conferred upon Mateo del Rosario power to 
administer their property and especially to sell it, and, in the exercise of 
this authority, Mateo del Rosario sold the lot and warehouse in question to 
Paulino Mendiola who in turn sold them to Ciriaco Bautista on August 13, 1895, 
all of which sales were recorded in the said property registry. (2) That Paulino 
Mendiola, notwithstanding the sale made to Ciriaco Bautista, continued in the 
possession of the lot and warehouse, pursuant to a contract of lease executed 
between himself and the latter. Hence, in 1904, when the judgment of the justice 
of the peace of Cabanatuan was rendered against Mendiola, the said property was 
attached as though it still at that time belonged to him.</p>
<p>However, it is not Ciriaco Bautista, the last owner recorded in the registry, 
but Bartolome Tablante who now intervenes for the recovery of the said property. 
The latter averred in his complaint that he purchased it from the former and" 
presented as the only proof of such purchase his Exhibit B, which is a letter 
addressed to him by Ciriaco Bautista, couched in the following terms:</p>
<p align="right">"CONCEPCION, July 6, 1908,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Mr. BARTOLOME TABLANTE.<br><br>"DEAR SIR: I have taken note of the contents 
of your letter to Captain Bias relative to the Sumaeab warehouse. I would inform 
you that this warehouse belongs exclusively to me, as you will see by the titte 
deed that you already have. I have sold it to no one else but you, nor have I, 
as regards this warehouse, any agent or authorized representative except Captain 
Bias, whom I have entrusted to deliver the title deed to you. Paulino Mendiola 
begged me to lease to him only the said warehouse, at P100 per annum; but he has 
not fulfilled his promise and a long time has elapsed since he gave up the 
warehouse. I hereby grant you full power to do whatever you please with the 
warehouse as well as with the land on which it stands * * *</p></blockquote>
<p align="right">(Signed) "CIRIACO BAUTISTA."</p>
<p>With this proof and the titles aforementioned presented by the plaintiff, 
Exhibit A, the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija rendered judgment in the 
case "by sentencing Jose Aquino to deliver to the plaintiff, Bartolome Tablante, 
the property in litigation and to pay to the said plaintiff the sum of P387.50 
with interest thereon at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from this date, and to 
pay the costs of this suit."</p>
<p>The defendant appealed to this court and made the following assignments of 
error: (1) The trial court erred in finding that the plaintiff is the owner of 
the real properties in question; (2) the court erred in finding that the 
defendant's possession was held in bad faith; and (3) the court erred in holding 
that the latter was liable for losses and damages and in sentencing him to the 
payment of the sum aforesaid with interest at 6 per cont per annum from the date 
of the sentence, and the costs.</p>
<p>The last two assignments of error must of course be sustained. The defendant 
was a possessor in good faith. "Any person who is not aware that there is in his 
title or in the manner of acquiring it any flaw invalidating the same shall be 
considered a possessor in good faith." (Civil Code, art. 433.) "Good faith is 
always presumed, and any person alleging bad faith on the part of the possessor 
is obliged to prove it;'' (Civil Code, art. 434.) The plaintiff could not have' 
averred, nor did he aver in his complaint that the defendant was a possessor in 
bad faith, and if he had made such a claim he neither produced nor attempted to 
produce any proof whatever of possession in bad faith on the part of the 
defendant and his predecessors. Consequently, the finding of possession in bad 
faith and the award of damages contained in the judgment appealed from are 
entirely unfounded.</p>
<p>With respect to the first assignment of error, strictly speaking it also 
should be sustained, inasmuch as the recovery of possession was decreed in the 
judgment without having first set aside the sales consecutively made by the 
sheriff to Emilio Vergara, by Vergara to Maria Romares, and by Romares to Jose 
Aquino, and without any previous pronouncement, made upon petition of one of the 
parties, that such sales were null and void. However, since an order to this 
effect may virtually be understood to be included in the recognition of 
ownership in the plaintiff, this first assignment of error will be examined only 
in connection with the ground upon which it was specified by the appellant.</p>
<p>This ground is no other than the averment that it was not proved at the trial 
that the sale, though consented to by Ciriaco Bautista in favor of Bartolome 
Tablante, was at any time consummated through the tradition or delivery of the 
thing sold. In fact, the ownership of things is not transferred from one person 
to another by mere consent in the contract, but through the delivery of the 
thing that is the subject of the contract. In the present case, it is admitted 
by the appellee that there was no material delivery of the lot and warehouse by 
Ciriaco Bautista to Bartolome Tablante, as up to now no. proof has been 
presented of a contract of sale made between Bautista and Tablante.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the law prescribes that "the placing of the titles of ownership 
in the possession of the vendee or the use which he may make of his right with 
the consent of the vendor shall be considered as a delivery." (Civil Code, art. 
1464.) The title deeds form the plaintiff's Exhibit A, and the use of his right 
by the purchaser who in his complaint lays claim to the lot and the warehouse, 
appear to have been consented to by the vendor, by means of the aforementioned 
Exhibit B. It is the same as though Ciriaco Bautista were the intervener, and if 
he had been, there would have been no cause for discussion.</p>
<p>Therefore, after first declaring the sale made by the sheriff, together with 
the subsequent ones, to be null and void, we declare Bartolome Tablante to be 
the owner of the lot and warehouse described in the complaint, and the 
defendant, Jose Aquino, is sentenced to restore them to the plaintiff, without 
special finding as to costs of both instances, affirming the judgment appealed 
from in so far as it is in agreement with this decision and reversing it in so 
far as it is not.</p>
