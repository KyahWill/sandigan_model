				<H3>MARIA CONCEJO BACAR AND PASCUAL MAGBANUA, PETITIONERS, VS. NICOLAS TORDECILLAS, AS JUSTICE OF THE PEACE OF THE MUNICIPALITY OF SIBALOM, PROVINCE OF ANTIQUE, RESPONDENT.

				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an original action commenced in the Supreme Court for the writ of 
prohibition. The petitioners allege that on or about the 9th day of April, 1918, 
Juan Dominguez presented a claim against them in the court of the justice of the 
peace of the municipality of San Jose accusing them of the crime of adultery; 
that they were duly arrested; that a preliminary examination was held before 
said justice of the peace on the 29th day of April, 1918; and that at the 
conclusion of same the justice of the peace, finding that the evidence was 
insufficient to support the charge in said complaint, dismissed the same; that 
later, on the 14th day of May, 1918, the said Juan Dominguez presented in the 
court of the justice of the peace of the municipality of Sibalom against said 
petitioners another complaint accusing them of the crime of adultery; that upon 
said complaint the petitioners were arrested and taken before the justice of the 
peace of the said municipality (Sibalom) on the 18th day of May, 1918, for a 
preliminary examination; that upon being informed of .said complaint and before 
pleading thereto, they objected to the jurisdiction of the said justice of the 
peace upon the ground that the alleged crime had not been committed within the 
municipality of Sibalom; that the said justice of the peace, Nicolas 
Tordecillas, overruled said objection on the 24th day of May, 1918, and set down 
said case for hearing on the 28th day of the same month.
<p>In answering the foregoing allegations, the respondent alleged that he had 
jurisdiction to conduct said preliminary examination by virtue of the following 
order signed by the Honorable Norberto Romualdez, judge:</p>
<blockquote><p>"The justice of the peace of Sibalom, Antique, is hereby authorized to make 
the preliminary investigation of the accusation brought before him by Francisco 
Dominguez against Pascual Magbanua and Maria Concejo Bacar for the crime of 
adultery.</p>
<p>"Issued at Bacolod, Occidental Negros, for Antique, on May 6, 1918.</p>
<p align="right">(Sgd.) "NORBERTO ROMUALDEZ,<br><em>"Judge of the Twenty-second 
District,<br>"On duty in the Seventeenth Judicial District."</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The respondent alleges that by virtue of said order and by virtue of section 
211 of the Administrative Code of 1917, he had authority and jurisdiction to 
conduct said preliminary examination.</p>
<p>It is true, that under certain conditions, the judge of the district shall 
designate a justice of the peace of one municipality to act as justice of the 
peace in another. Those conditions ar6, that both the justice of the peace and 
the auxiliary justice shall be disqualified or unable to perform the regular 
duties of their office. If the office of the justice of the peace is vacant or 
the justice of the peace is absent or is disabled or disqualified, or resigns or 
is dead, then the auxiliary justice of the peace may act. And in case there is 
no auxiliary justice of the peace who is qualified to act, then, in that case, 
the judge of the district may designate the nearest justice of the peace of the 
province to act as justice of the peace in such municipality, etc., and when so 
appointed, shall have jurisdiction of the cases in said municipality, etc.</p>
<p>Under said section (211), the judge of the district is not authorized to 
appoint a justice of the peace of another municipality to act until the above 
conditions are made to appear.</p>
<p>Inasmuch, therefore, as there is nothing in the record which shows that the 
regular justice of the peace of the municipality of San Jose, nor the auxiliary 
justice of the peace, were disqualified or unable to act for some reason or 
other, the judge of the district was without authority to appoint the justice of 
the peace of another municipality to act in their stead. The record not only 
shows that the justice of the peace was not disqualified to act, but that he was 
qualified to act and had acted in the premises.</p>
<p>From the foregoing it is clear that the respondent was without jurisdiction 
to hear and determine the question presented in the complaint before him.</p>
<p>Therefore, let the writ prayed for be issued, with costs. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Araullo, Street, Malcolm</em>, and <em>Avance√±a, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p></div>
