				<H3>INES FELICIANO, PETITIONER AND APPELLANT, VS. ELISA CAMAHORT, ADMINISTRATRIX AND APPELLEE.

				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is an  appeal from the action of the Court of First Instance of Manila in removing the appellant Ines Feliciano, and appointing one Manuel Navarro, as guardian of certain minor children.</p>
<p>In  matters  of  this  nature a  large  discretion must be allowed the judge who deals directly with the parties, and who, for this reason, should  be exceptionally well qualified to form a correct opinion as to the special needs  of  the minors,  the character and qualifications of persons whose names are proposed for appointment as guardian, and  the wise and prudent course to be  adopted under all the varying circumstances of each particular case.  As a rule, when it appears, as it does in this case, that the judge  has exercised care and diligence in selecting the guardian, and has given due consideration to the reasons for and against his action which are urged by the interested parties, his action should not be  disturbed unless  it is  made very clear that he has fallen into grievous error.</p>
<p>In the  case  at bar, we  do not think that appellant has made such a showing and we do not believe therefore, that we would be justified in interfering with  the  appointment made by the experienced judge from whom this appeal has been taken.  It must be admitted  that appellant makes a fairly strong  showing  in  support  of  his  contentions, and it may even be admitted that upon that showing, some of us, at least,  would not have followed the course adopted by the trial judge had  we been  called upon to act in this matter originally; but we are all agreed that the facts before us are not sufficient to justify us in holding that such an error in the exercise of his discretion was  committed by the judge below as would justify us in reversing the action taken  by him. We the  more  readily adopt this view, because,  if it develops  in the light of future events that the guardian heretofore appointed  is  not  a fit person, .the question, of his removal can again be brought to the attention of the court below.</p>
<p>The decree  entered in  these  proceedings in  the court below is affirmed, with the costs of  this  instance against the appellant.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C,  J.,  Torres, Mapa,</em> and <em>Trent,  JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
