				<H3>TAN CHIN HIN, PETITIONER AND APPELLEE, VS. THE INSULAR COLLECTOR OF CUSTOMS, RESPONDENT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">It appears from the record that Tan Seng, a Chinese boy of about 17 years of 
age, claiming to be the son of Tan Chin Hin, a resident merchant of the city of 
Manila, arrived at the port of Manila from China on the steamship Chinhita, on 
the 13th day of February, 1914. The customs authorities refused Tan Seng the 
right to enter the Philippine Islands. The question was referred to the board of 
special inquiry and an investigation was held, in which several witnesses 
testified. After hearing the. evidence, two of the three members of the board of 
special inquiry found that the said Tan Seng was not, in their opinion, the 
legitimate son of the said Tan Chin Hin, and denied to Tan Seng the right to 
enter the Philippine Islands.The third member of the board, while he admitted 
that there were some discrepancies in the proof adduced before the board, held 
that the same were not of sufficient importance to refuse the said Tan Seng the 
right to land in the Philippine Islands.
<p>From the decision of the board of special inquiry an appeal was taken to the 
Collector of Customs, the Honorable B. Herstein, who, upon an examination of the 
record sent to him, found that the said Tan Seng was not entitled to enter the 
Philippine Islands, and held as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is claimed on behalf of this immigrant (Tan Seng) that he is the 
legitimate minor son of Tan Chin Hin, a resident Chinese merchant. He states 
that he is 17 years of age and that he has two younger brothers, aged 13 and 9, 
respectively. The witnesses presented on his behalf testified that they are 
acquainted with the father of this immigrant and his family and that the 
immigrant is such legitimate son, as claimed, but there appear to be 
<em>discrepancies in their evidence </em>as to the ages of the other children in 
the family. The board of (special) inquiry found that the applicant has <em>the 
appearance of being considerably younger than seventeen</em> and considering 
further the nature of the testimony of the witnesses as to the age of the other 
members of the (Tan Chin Hin's) family, concluded that the applicant is not the 
son of Tan Chin Hin, as claimed.</p>
<p>"From a careful review of the record in the case, the conclusions of the 
board of special inquiry appear to be reasonable and just and no reason is seen 
for reversing the decision made. </p>
<p>"The said Tan Seng is therefore refused landing, and it is hereby ordered 
that he be returned to his port of embarkation at the expense of the vessel 
bringing him, on the next sailing of any vessel of the same 
line."</p></blockquote>
<p>Upon being informed of the foregoing decision of the Collector of Customs, 
the said Tan Chin Hin, on behalf of his alleged son, Tan Seng, presented a 
petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Court of First Instance in the city 
of Manila. Upon a consideration of said petition, the judge of the Court of 
First Instance issued an order requiring the Collector of Customs to show cause 
why the writ of habeas corpus should not be granted as prayed for. In response 
to said order the Collector of Customs made a full and complete statement of the 
proceedings had before him in the department of customs, accompanying said 
report by a certified copy of all the proceedings, including the evidence taken 
before the board of special inquiry.</p>
<p>Upon the issue presented by said petition and return, the judge of the Court 
of First Instance, apparently without first determining that there had been an 
<em>abuse of authority</em> on the part of the customs department, proceeded to 
take testimony upon the question whether or not the said Tan Seng was entitled 
to enter the Philippine Islands. The right to determine, in the first instance, 
whether or not a Chinese alien has a right to enter the United States or the 
territories thereof to which the Chinese Immigration Laws have been extended, 
has been conferred by law upon a branch of the executive department of the 
Government, The judicial department of the Government has no authority or right 
to intervene in determining the right of aliens to enter the Philippine Islands, 
except and until it has been, proven and shown clearly that that branch of the 
executive department of the Government upon which the power to determine that 
question has been conferred by law, <em>has abused its authority. </em>In other 
words, until it is shown that the customs authorities have abused their 
authority in refusing Chinese aliens the right to land in the Philippine 
Islands, the courts are without authority to intervene. The decision of the 
customs authorities is final, unless it is shown that they have abused their 
authority. An abuse of authority exists when there is no proof presented to 
support the conclusions of the customs authorities or when they have misapplied 
a clear provision of the law. The customs authorities act more or less as a jury 
in determining the facts in the first instance. They have an opportunity to see 
and hear the witnesses and they are under no obligation to believe the 
declarations of a witness if his manner or conduct during the examination is 
such as to cause them to disbelieve him, even though his declarations are not 
disputed by any other witness. (Ekiu <em>vs.</em> United States, 142 U. S., 651; 
Yamataya <em>vs.</em> Fisher, 189 U. S., 86; U. S. <em>vs.</em> Ju Toy, 198 U. 
S., 253; Lem Moon Sing <em>vs</em>. United States, 158 U. S., 538; Chin Low 
<em>vs.</em> United States, 208 U. S., 8; Lo Po<em> vs.</em> McCoy, 8 Phil. 
Rep., 343; Jao Igco <em>vs.</em> Shuster, 10 Phil. Rep., 448; U. S. <em>vs.</em> 
Williams, 190 Fed. Rep., 6860 The admission of aliens into the United States is 
regulated by Acts of Congress. The supervision is confined to the department of 
immigration charged with the enforcement of laws regulating the admission. The 
final determination of all facts with relation to the qualification of aliens to 
enter the United States or their deportation is intrusted to the proper 
immigration officers, "whose decision is final, unless reversed on appeal to the 
Secretary of Labor" (in the Philippine Islands the Collector of Customs). By the 
Act of Congress these officers are made the sole and exclusive judges of the 
existence of the facts establishing qualification, and <em>no other 
tribunal</em> is vested with authority or power by Congress to reexamine and 
consider the sufficiency of the evidence on which these officers acted, until it 
is shown that such officers abused the authority conferred upon them by law. So 
long as the officers clothed with this authority act within the limits placed by 
Congress, <em>courts have no right to interfere.</em> The authority of the 
immigration officers and the jurisdiction of the courts depend upon the power 
conferred by Congress. It is a matter of legislation. No discretion is vested in 
the courts. Congress has the right to legislate upon the subject, <em>prescribe 
rules, fix limits, and confer authority where it deems wise in legislating upon 
the subject at hand.</em> Under the present law, the final authority, unless an 
abuse of authority is shown, is conferred upon the immigration officers. The 
only right of the courts to intervene is when and after it has been shown that 
such officers have abused their authority and that the parties have not been 
given a full, fair, and free hearing. (Ekiu <em>vs.</em> U. S., 142 U. S., 651; 
Lo Po <em>vs.</em> McCoy, 8 Phil. Rep., 343; Ex Parte Petkos, 212 Fed., Rep., 
275; U. S. <em>vs.</em> Ju Toy, 198 U. S., 253; Ex Parte Joyce, 212 Fed., Rep., 
282.)</p>
<p>A <em>mere refusal</em> by the proper authorities to allow an alien to enter 
the territory of the United States is not an abuse of authority. The law permits 
the examining officer or board to examine the applicant for admission, and such 
other witnesses as may be presented, to hear their testimony and to decide upon 
such testimony whether or not the applicant is entitled to enter. The authority 
to examine into the facts relating to the right of the applicant to enter 
implies the discretion to decide upon such evidence, and unless it is clearly 
proved that this discretion was abused, the courts will refuse to take 
jurisdiction for the purpose of determining the questions of the right of the 
alien to enter. (Lo Po <em>vs.</em> McCoy, 8 Phil. Rep., 343.)</p>
<p>The attorney for the appellee in the present case asserts that there was no 
proof adduced against the right of the said Tan Seng to land in the Philippine 
Islands. The burden is not upon the executive department of the Government to 
show that an alien immigrant has not a right to land in the territory of the 
United States. The burden is upon the alien seeking to land to show that he has 
a right to enter. Upon this branch of the case, therefore, it is our conclusion, 
there being some proof to support the conclusions of the customs authorities, 
that there was no abuse of authority and that the judge of the Court of First 
Instance was without authority in the present case to admit proof upon the right 
of Tan Seng to land in the Philippine Islands. The Court of First Instance had 
no jurisdiction even to consider the case in the first instance, further than to 
determine whether or not there had been an abuse of authority on the part of the 
customs authorities.</p>
<p>The attorney for the petitioner in his brief attempts to show that the 
Customs authorities of the Philippine Islands are without right to examine into 
the question of the right of Chinese aliens to land in the Philippine Islands. 
That question has been presented to this court in numerous instances and in each 
instance has been decided against his contention. (<em>In re</em> Allen, 2 Phil. 
Rep., 630; Ngo-Ti <em>vs.</em> Shuster, 7 Phil. Rep., 355; Jao Igco <em>vs.</em> 
Shuster, 10 Phil. Rep., 448; Juan Co <em>vs.</em> Rafferty, 14 Phil. Rep., 235.) 
</p>
<p>After fully considering all of the questions presented by the appellant as 
well as the appellee, we are of the opinion that the judgment of the Court of 
First Instance should be reversed and that the judgment of the Collector of 
Customs should be affirmed. It is, therefore, hereby ordered and decreed that 
the judgment of this court be entered reversing the judgment of the Court of 
First Instance and affirming the judgment of the Collector of Customs, and that 
the case be remanded to the Court of First Instance from whence it came and that 
a judgment be entered therein in accordance with the foregoing.</p>

<p><strong>MORELAND, J.</strong></p>
<p>I agree to the result in this case.</p>
<p>I think, however, that, in order to avoid confusion and misunderstanding, 
attention should be directed to the fact that the present case reverses, or at 
least modifies, the rule laid down with respect to what constitutes an abuse of 
authority in the case of Ang Eng Chong vs. The Insular Collector of Customs (23 
Phil. Rep., 614). In that case it was stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"An abuse of authority certainly exists:</p>
<p>" (<em>a</em>) When a person has been denied admission into the territory of 
the United States who does not belong to any of the excluded classes. For 
example: A citizen of the United States or any other person who has acquired a 
right to be in and to remain in territory of the United States. (U. S. 
<em>vs.</em> Go-Siaco, 12 Phil. Rep., 490; Muñoz <em>vs.</em> Collector of 
Customs, 20 Phil. Rep., 494; U. S. <em>vs.</em> Yu Kiao, 20 Phil. Rep.,307; U. 
S. <em>vs.</em> Gue Lim, 176 U. S., 459; 83 Fed. Rep., 136.)</p>
<p>" (<em>b</em>) When a person seeking admission has not been given a full, 
fair, and free hearing. For example, when he has not been given an opportunity 
to present all the material proof which he desires to present. (Ngo-Ti 
<em>vs.</em> Shuster, 7 Phil. Rep., 355; U. S. <em>vs.</em> Ju Toy, 198 U. S., 
253; Lo Po <em>vs.</em> McCoy, 8 Phil. Rep., 343.)</p>
<p>"(c) When there is no proof at all presented against the right of the 
applicant seeking admission. (U. S. <em>vs.</em> Williams, 189 Fed. Rep., 
915.)"</p></blockquote>
<p>I declined to concur in the decision upon the ground that the statements in 
paragraphs (<em>b</em>) and (<em>c</em>) were not correct statements of the 
rules governing the respective cases.</p>
<p>First, with reference to (c):</p>
<p>As was observed by the court in the case of United States <em>vs.</em> 
Williams (203 Fed., 155, 158), the Chinese Immigration Acts put the burden of 
proof expressly upon the Chinaman, and contain no restriction whatsoever as to 
the kind of proof upon which the immigration authorities are to act. In the case 
of Fong Yue Ting <em>vs.</em> The United States (149 U. S., 698), the court 
said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If no evidence is offered by the Chinaman, the judge makes the order of 
deportation, as upon a default. If he produces competent evidence to explain the 
fact of his not having a certificate, it must be considered by the judge; and if 
he thereupon appears to be entitled to a certificate, it is to be granted to 
him."</p></blockquote>
<p>This rule (<em>c</em>) is now modified by the present decision and the 
correct rule on the subject stated to be: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The burden is not upon the executive department of the Government to show 
that an alien immigrant has not a right to land in the territory of the United 
States. The burden is upon the alien seeking to land to show that he has a right 
to enter."<br></p></blockquote>
<p>Second, as to (<em>b</em>):</p>
<p>I am constrained to believe that the case cited does not correctly state the 
rule relative to the kind of hearing that must be given' to the alien, and that 
that error is carried into the present decision. It says: "The only right of the 
courts to intervene is when and after it has been shown that such officers have 
abused their authority and that the parties have not been given a full, fair, 
and free hearing."</p>
<p>As I understand the rule, it does not require a full or a "free" hearing. All 
that is required is a <em>hearing.</em> It does not have to have the elements of 
a formal trial and no formal complaint or pleadings are required and the want of 
them does not affect the authority of the judge, or the validity of the statute. 
(Fong Yue Ting <em>vs.</em> The United States, 149 U. S.,698, 729.)</p>
<p>In the Japanese Immigrant Case (189 U. S., 86) the kind of hearing which was 
accorded the immigrant is stated by the court as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Besides, the record now before us shows that the appellant had notice, 
although not a formal one, of the investigation instituted for the purpose of 
ascertaining whether she was illegally in this country. The traverse to the 
return made by the Immigration Inspector shows upon its face that she was before 
that officer pending the investigation of her right to be in the United States, 
and made answers to questions propounded to her. It is true that she pleads a 
want of knowledge of our language; that she did not understand the nature and 
import of the questions propounded to her; that the investigation made was a 
"pretended" one; and that she did not, at the time, know that the investigation 
had reference to her being deported from the country. These considerations 
cannot justify the intervention of the courts. * * * Suffice it to say, it does 
not appear that appellant was denied an opportunity to be heard. And as no 
appeal was taken to the Secretary from the decision of the immigration 
inspector, that decision was final and conclusive. If the appellant's want of 
knowledge of the English language put her at some disadvantage in the 
investigation conducted by that officer, that was her misfortune, and 
constitutes no reason, under the acts of Congress, or under any rule of law, for 
the intervention of the court by habeas corpus. We perceive no ground for such 
intervention— none for the contention that due process of law was denied to 
appellant."</p></blockquote>
<p>Can such a hearing as this be held to be a "full, fair, and free hearing?" 
Nevertheless the court said it was sufficient, saying that while no person shall 
be deprived of liberty without an opportunity to be heard in respect of matters 
upon which that liberty depends, that does not necessarily mean "an opportunity 
upon a regular, set occasion, and according to the, forms of judicial procedure, 
but one that will secure the prompt, vigorous action contemplated by Congress, 
and at the same time be appropriate to the nature of the case upon which such 
officers are required to act." (<em>Id.</em>)</p>
<p>For these reasons, I am of the opinion that the rule as to a hearing stated 
in the decision of the court in this case is not the correct one.<br></p></div>
