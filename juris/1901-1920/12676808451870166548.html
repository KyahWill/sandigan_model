				<BR><BR><p></p><div align="justify">This is an action&nbsp; of&nbsp; <em>quo warranto,</em> begun in this court. It appears that the&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; was duly&nbsp; elected president&nbsp; of the&nbsp; municipality&nbsp; of Lingayen, Province&nbsp; of&nbsp; Pangasinan. After his election the defendant protested that election upon two grounds:<p>First.&nbsp; That the plaintiff&nbsp; was ineligible to&nbsp; hold the office of municipal president&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the ground that he had been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude.</p><p>Second. That&nbsp; ballots had been&nbsp; counted&nbsp; in&nbsp; favor of the plaintiff&nbsp; which,&nbsp; as a matter of fact,&nbsp; should not&nbsp; have been counted&nbsp; for&nbsp; him and which&nbsp; were sufficient&nbsp; to&nbsp; reduce the number&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; votes which he&nbsp; actually&nbsp; received below that received by&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant.</p><p>The court heard the protest and decided in favor of the defendant upon the ground last mentioned, declining the consideration of the eligibility of the plaintiff to such office.</p><p>This action was begun upon the sole theory and founded upon the single ground that the decision of the court in the protest mentioned was&nbsp; null&nbsp; and void for the reason that not all of the candidates voted for for that office had been notified of the&nbsp; protest as required&nbsp; by law and that, therefore, the court&nbsp; was without jurisdiction or power to enter the judgment which it did enter in favor of the defendant. It is the contention that&nbsp; the court being entirely without jurisdiction&nbsp; and, therefore, its judgment in&nbsp; favor&nbsp; of the defendant being null and void, the defendant is usurping the office and unlawfully excluding the plaintiff therefrom.</p><p>While this is an action of <em>quo warranto</em>, we have so far treated it in the nature of a&nbsp; certiorari as to require the elevation to this court of the record made in the court below relative to said protest.&nbsp; From that record it appears that the very question of the notice to all of the candidates voted for at said&nbsp; election for the office, of municipal president was raised before the court below and fully considered and decided by it.&nbsp; After the entry of the judgment in favor of the defendant, a motion&nbsp; was made by the plaintiff to vacate and&nbsp; set aside&nbsp; said&nbsp; judgment and to&nbsp; dismiss the whole&nbsp; proceeding upon&nbsp; the ground&nbsp; that not all&nbsp; of said candidates had been notified of the protest as required&nbsp; by law.&nbsp; The motion was heard.&nbsp; The question was litigated. The evidence&nbsp; was discussed and&nbsp; considered.&nbsp; The&nbsp; arguments&nbsp; of&nbsp; counsel were&nbsp; presented.&nbsp; The court found from the evidence that all of the candidates had&nbsp; been&nbsp; notified of the protest&nbsp; and that the notice was&nbsp; in the form and served in&nbsp; the manner and within the time required by the statute.&nbsp; That question having been raised before the court below and passed upon there, we are unable to see&nbsp; at this moment how an action of <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span> can be maintained, based upon the theory that such notice was lacking.&nbsp; That question having been determined&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; court below, and the decision&nbsp; never&nbsp; having&nbsp; been&nbsp; questioned&nbsp; in the&nbsp; only manner in which such a decision&nbsp; can be, we must hold it conclusive in this action, <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span> not being a method by&nbsp; which that decision can be reviewed.&nbsp; We are,&nbsp; therefore, of the opinion that the action must be dismissed.</p><p>The complaint is hereby dismissed.&nbsp; So ordered.</p><p><em>Arellano,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J.,&nbsp; Torres,&nbsp; Mapa,&nbsp; Johnson, Carson,</em>&nbsp; and <em>Trent, JJ</em>., concur.</p><p><br></p><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="center"><p align="center"> <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <strong>ON REHEARING</strong></p><p align="right"> JANUARY&nbsp; 22, 1913.</p><p><strong>MORELAND, J.:</strong></p><p>A motion for permission&nbsp; to proceed with the action of <em>quo warranto</em> and to take testimony relative to the question whether all the candidates voted for at the election referred to in these proceedings had been regularly notified of the initiation of the protest.</p><p>We have to say, in&nbsp; amplification of our former opinion on this question, that the general rule is that, where the jurisdiction&nbsp; of the court depends&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the existence of facts, and the court&nbsp; judicially considers and&nbsp; adjudicates the question of its jurisdiction, and decides that the facts exist which are necessary to give it jurisdiction of the case, the finding is conclusive and&nbsp; cannot be&nbsp; controverted in a collateral&nbsp; proceeding.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Phelps&nbsp; <em>vs.</em>&nbsp; The&nbsp; Mutual&nbsp; Reserve Fund, 112 Fed., 453;&nbsp; S.
