				G.R. No. 2655, September 11, 1906</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. MODESTO ANGELES, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The evidence is sufficient to show that the  defendant, Modesto Angeles, manufactured a  seal in  imitation of the seal of the municipality of Lipa, in the Province of Batangas, for the purpose  of  using it in the making of false certificates of the transfer by him of live stock.   He therefore violated article  312 of the Penal Code.</p>
<p>The falsification of one of these  documents is punished, as we have  just held in the  case of the United States <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Florentino Sayson<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> (4 Off. Gaz., 572), by article 311 and not by articles 300 or 301 of the Penal Code.  The punishment  in this case can not, therefore, exceed that of  the grade immediately inferior to <em>arresto mayor</em>, which is a fine.</p>
<p>The judgment of the court below as to Modesto Angeles is reversed and the defendant is convicted of a violation of article 312 of the Penal Code and is sentenced to pay a fine of  200 pesos,  with the costs of both instances, and subsidiary imprisonment in accordance with the law, but not to  exceed one month, if the fine  is not paid.</p>
<p>After the expiration of ten days let judgment be entered in  accordance herewith and ten days  thereafter  let the record  in this case be remanded to the  trial court for execution.  So ordered.</p>
<em>Arellano, C. J.,  Torres, Mapa, Carson,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
