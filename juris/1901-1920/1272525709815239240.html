				<H3>THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. ANTONIO V. HERRERO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>FISHER, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On the 25th day of January, 1910, the appellant and one Jose Robles Lahesa 
executed to ttye Government of the Philippine Islands a joint and several bond 
in the penal sum of P200, the conditions of which bond were that—
<p>"Whereas the Director of Constabulary has on the 30th day of June, 1908, 
issued to the above-bounded Jose Robles Lahesa a license to purchase and keep 
the following firearms, viz: One revolver—Garland—Cal. 22, No. 4152, and 100 
cartridges, and the above-bounded Jose Robles Lahesa has covenanted and agreed 
and does hereby covenant and agree, that he will safely keep the said firearms, 
or any of them, and will deliver the same to the Government of the Philippine 
Islands on demand, and that he will not sell or dispose of these firearms 
without permission of the Director of Constabulary.</p>
<p>"Now, therefore, if the above-bounded Jose Robles Lahesa shall and will in 
all^respects duly and truly observe and perform all and singular the aforesaid 
covenants, conditions, and agreements by the said Jose Robles Lahesa, to be 
observed and performed, according to the true intent and meaning thereof, then 
the above obligation shall be void and of no effect; otherwise to remain in full 
force and virtue."</p>
<p>It is averred in the complaint, and was admitted by appellant in open court, 
that in consideration of the execution of the bond Robles was given a license to 
keep a revolver; that he later left the Philippine Islands without informing the 
authorities of his intention to change his residence; that his present 
whereabouts are not known; that thereafter the Director of Constabulary in May, 
1912, November, 1913, and January, 1914, made written demands upon Robles to 
bring the revolver and his license "to the office of the Chief of Police of 
Manila for due inspection," which demands were delivered to the appellant, as 
one of Robles' bondsmen; that notwithstanding these demands, neither the license 
nor the revolver has been taken to the office of the Chief of Police of 
Manila.</p>
<p>Upon these facts the court below held that the conditions of the bond have 
been broken, and gave judgment against defendant for the payment to the 
Government of the Philippine Islands of the sum of P200. From this judgment 
defendant has appealed, and contends that the failure of his principal to 
produce the revolver and firearms license for inspection is not a breach of the 
conditions of the bond for which he may be held liable.</p>
<p>The only question is whether the failure of Robles to take the revolver and 
his license to the office of the Chief of Police for inspection constitutes a 
breach of the condition that he would "deliver the same to the Government of the 
Philippine Islands on demand * * *."</p>
<p>Section 14 of The Firearms Act, in force when the bond in question was 
executed, makes it the duty of any person holding a license to possess firearms 
to exhibit them, whenever called upon to do so, to the Chief of Police of 
Manila, or any of the other officials therein named, and provides that a 
violation of the provisions of this section may, in the discretion of the 
Governor-General, be punished <em>by revocation of the license</em>. Section 15 
of the same Act requires the Chief of Police to make an annual verification of 
all arms in the possession of residents of Manila to whom licenses have been 
issued, and to indorse the fact of such verification, together with a note of 
the date thereof, upon the license.</p>
<p>It is admitted that Robles has failed to produce his license for verification 
as required by section 14 of The Firearms Act, and his license, immediately upon 
that failure, became subject to revocation, in the discretion of the Governor- 
General. Had the license been revoked and demand thereafter made upon Robles for 
the delivery of the firearm for surrender thereof to the Government, failure to 
make such delivery would no doubt have constituted a breach of the terms of the 
bond here in suit, but it does not appear that the license was ever revoked or 
that after revocation a demand was ever made upon Robles for the surrender of 
the revolver. It is obvious that Robles has violated two of the conditions upon 
which the <em>license</em> was issued, and that it might be revoked for either 
of those reasons, but the liability of his bondsmen is to be measured by the 
terms of the contract alone and does not include any obligation imposed upon 
their principal by the general terms of The Firearms Act but which is not 
embodied in the bond. With respect to Robles, his obligations arising from the 
permission granted him to keep a revolver are to be measured by The Firearms Act 
in general, and by the terms of his contract in particular, but with respect to 
his sureties, their liabilities are to be measured solely by the terms of the 
contract subscribed by them. The forfeiture of the license for failure to 
produce it for inspection under section 14, or for failure to give notice of the 
change of address under section 13, would not constitute a breach of the 
obligation of the sureties. They are only liable in the event that Robles does 
or fails to do one or more of the specific things required by the bond. It does 
not appear that he has failed on demand to deliver his revolver to the 
Government of the Philippine Islands. The demand that he produce it for 
inspection is not a demand for its delivery.</p>
<p>The purpose of this action is to enforce the payment of a penalty. 
Obligations imposing penalties and forfeitures must be strictly construed, for 
it is well settled that sureties are only chargeable according to the strict 
terms of the bond. The terms of their contract are those which measure the 
extent of their liability. (5 Cyc, 758.) While it is quite probable, upon the 
facts disclosed by the evidence, that had Robles' license been revoked and 
demand made upon him for the surrender of the revolver, it would not have been 
produced, that does not alter the fact that so far it has only been made to 
appear that he has failed to comply with the demand that his license and the 
revolver be produced for <em>verification</em> and <em>inspection</em>. The 
sureties have not agreed that for Robles' failure to do either or both of these 
things they would pay the penalty of P200 demanded of them.</p>
<p>We are, therefore, of the opinion that the judgment should be reversed, 
absolving the defendant from the complaint. So ordered,</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson</em>, and <em>Street, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p>
<p><em>Malcolm, J.</em>, dissents.</p></div>
