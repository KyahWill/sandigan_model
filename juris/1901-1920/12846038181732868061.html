				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The purpose of the present action was to recover damages for the loss of the 
sailing vessel <em>Carmencita</em>, the property of the plaintiffs, and her 
cargo which was lost at high sea in a collision with the steamship <em>Taculin 
</em>which belonged to the defendants. The plaintiffs alleged that the said 
<em>Carmencita</em> was lost at sea through the negligence of the agents and 
representatives of the defendants in managing and operating the said steamship 
<em>Taculin</em>. It is alleged that on or about midnight of the 27th day of 
April, 1914, the said <em>Carmencita</em> was sailing south from the city of 
Cebu and, at the time of the collision, was just east of the Island of Guimaras 
between the point Culasi of the Island of Guimaras and Pulupandan, a part of the 
municipality of Valladolid of the province of Occidental Negros; that the 
steamship <em>Taculin</em> was sailing north and had come from the said port of 
Pulupandan; and that at that point a collision took place between the said two 
ships, caused by the negligence of the captain and crew of the said 
<em>Taculin</em>; and that as a result of said collision the sailing vessel 
<em>Carmencita</em> was totally destroyed together with her cargo as well as the 
life of one of the passengers, the daughter of the captain; that the value of 
the cargo was P225; and that the value of the said sailing vessel was 
P5,500.
<p>The defendants filed a general denial. Upon the issue presented by the 
petition and the answer the case was brought on for trial. After hearing the 
evidence, the Honorable J. S. Powell, judge, found that a preponderance of the 
evidence showed that the defendants, through their agents and representatives, 
in managing the steamship <em>Taculin</em> negligently destroyed the sailing 
vessel <em>Carmencita</em> together with her cargo, and rendered a judgment in 
favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendants for the sum of P5,225 with 
interest from the 22d day of October, 1914, until paid, and the costs. From that 
judgment the defendants appealed to this court.</p>
<p>In their first assignment of error the appellants alleged that the lower 
court committed an error in finding that the said sailing ship Carmencita 
carried lights at the time of the collision. Upon that question the captain of 
the <em>Carmencita</em> and several members of her crew swore positively that 
the said ship was lighted in accordance with the requirements of navigation. She 
had a green light upon the starboard and a red light upon the larboard side of 
the boat as well as other lights. The statements of the captain and his crew 
were also supported by the captain of another boat, the <em>Estrella</em>, who 
passed the <em>Carmencita</em> a short time before the collision took place. 
That captain swore that the <em>Carmencita</em> had the usual lights; that he 
passed near by the said <em>Carmencita</em> on the night in question. The 
captain of the <em>Taculin</em> swore that he did not see any lights upon the 
<em>Carmencita</em> at the time of or immediately before the collision took 
place. Upon the first assignment of error there seems to be a large 
preponderance of evidence in favor of the finding of the lower court.</p>
<p>The appellants in their second assignment of error alleged that the court 
erred in finding that the captain of the <em>Taculin</em> was guilty of 
negligence. The captain of the <em>Taculin</em> swore that he did not see the 
<em>Carmencita</em> until he was right upon her; that he was within twenty 
brazas before he saw her. The captain of the <em>Carmencita</em> swore that he 
saw the <em>Taculin</em> approaching; that he first saw the red light of the 
<em>Taculin</em>; that almost immediately he saw the green light of the 
<em>Taculin</em>; and that then the collision occurred. If it be true that the 
captain of the <em>Carmencita</em> first saw the red light of the 
<em>Taculin</em> and then very shortly saw the green light that fact is proof 
positive that the Taculin had changed her course; for if she had continued in 
the direction in which she was going at the time the captain of the 
<em>Carmencita</em> saw the red light, she would have passed upon the port side 
of the <em>Carmencita</em>. To have changed her course, which the captain of the 
<em>Taculin</em> admitted so as to display the green light upon the starboard 
side is proof positive that such a change in course brought the <em>Taculin</em> 
in a direction which would cross the path of the <em>Carmencita</em>. The proof 
shows that the <em>Taculin</em> collided with the <em>Carmencita</em> upon the 
port side which was the natural result of the change of course of the 
<em>Taculin</em>; and it was the change of the course, as above indicated, by 
the <em>Taculin</em> which enabled the captain of the <em>Carmencita</em> to see 
the green light of the <em>Taculin</em> after he had first seen the red light. 
It will be remembered that the red lights are always put upon the port side, 
while the green lights are always put upon the starboard side of a ship at sea. 
As further proof of the negligence of the captain of the Taculin we have the 
declaration of captain Echevaria. He testified that had the <em>Taculin</em> 
been properly managed, the collision might have been avoided after the time when 
the captain of the <em>Taculin</em> first saw the <em>Carmencita</em> at a 
distance of twenty brazas or about 120 feet. Captain Echevaria testified that 
even in a shorter distance that 120 feet the collision might have been 
avoided.</p>
<p>In considering the question of negligence we must not overlook the fact that 
the <em>Carmencita</em> was a sailing vessel while the <em>Taculin</em> was a 
ship operated by steam, nor the International Rules (article 20) for the 
Prevention of Collisions at Sea that; "If two ships, one of which is a sailing 
ship and the other a steamship, are proceedings in such directions as to involve 
risk of collision, the steamship shall keep out of the way of the sailing 
ship."</p>
<p>Article 21 of the International Rules for the Prevention of Collisions at Sea 
provides that; "Where by any of these rules one of two vessels is to keep out of 
the way, the other shall keep her course and speed."</p>
<p>The proof shows that the captain of the <em>Taculin</em> changed the course 
of his ship in a way that brought it cross the path of the <em>Carmencita</em>. 
We are of the opinion that a large preponderance of the proof supports the 
conclusion of the lower court that the captain of the <em>Taculin</em> was 
negligent in the management of his ship, which directly caused the loss of the 
said <em>Carmencita</em>.</p>
<p>In their third assignment of error the appellants alleged that the lower 
court committed an error in rendering a judgment against them for the sum of 
P5,225. It is admitted that the cargo was valued at P225. Several witnesses 
testified that the <em>Carmencita</em> was worth more than P5,000. Some of the 
witnesses testified that she was worth, at least P5,500. There is sufficient 
proof in the record to justify the conclusion of the lower court that the 
<em>Carmencita</em> was worth, at least P5,000. Valuing the ship at P5,000 and 
the cargo at P225 a judgment was rendered for the sum of P5,225. We think that 
part of the judgment of the lower court is fully sustained by a preponderance of 
the proof.</p>
<p>After a careful examination of the evidence we find no reasons for altering 
or modifying the judgment of the lower court. The same is, therefore, hereby 
affirmed, with costs. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Carson, Araullo, Street,</em> and <em>Malcolm, JJ.,</em>
