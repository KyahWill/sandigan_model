				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. PEDRO PALMADRES , DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The complaint in this case  is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"That on or about the 29th day of May,  1904, in the barrio of Isabang, of the municipality of Lucena, Province of Tayabas, P. I., the said Pedro Palmadres, and two others, armed with bolos, robbed one Jose Alconaba and a certain boy of a small sum of money, and that for  this purpose they killed the said Jose Alconaba."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As to the two companions  of the defendant Palmadres, it appears that Florentino Desembrana was found dead on the same day  in question  a short distance  from the  body of the deceased Jose Alconaba, the bodies being identified by the <em>cedulas</em> that were found upon their  persons, Desembrana's head having been severed from his body.</p>
<p>The boy referred to  in the complaint was  a  nephew of the deceased, Alconaba, named Licerio Alconaba, a student of 16 years of age.  He testified that on the morning of the day in question he  and his uncle, while together,  were attacked,  taken  to  the mountains,  tied to a tree, blind-folded, and robbed of the money they had in  their possession, amounting1 to 2 <em>reales</em> and 4 <em>cuartos</em>; that they  managed to  free themselves, and while on their way to Lucena they were again attacked hj the defendants; that his uncle who  carried a pocket-knife resisted the attack, while the witness  hid himself in  the grass, and then ran  to Lucena to notify  the police; and that when he returned to the place in question,  accompanied by the police, they found his uncle and one of the robbers dead on the ground.</p>
<p>The evidence of  the  prosecution against the defendant, Palmadres,  although  circumstantial,  is  convincing, it being based upon  facts which were fully established by the testimony of Licerio Alconaba, Maria Espinosa, the wife of  the deceased Desembrana, Lope  Capistrano,  and Carlos Capistrano, and his identification by  an old  man, Catalino Sevilla, who had about the same time been attacked by the same  three individuals and who, like Alconaba, was tied to a  tree in the mountains and robbed of 4  pesos, he having  been found  in  this position by the police who were called by Licerio Alconaba.</p>
<p>The findings of the court below  do not seem  to  be in conflict Avith the evidence, nor do we find therein any error either of law or of  fact.  The court below convicted the defendant of the crime charged in the complaint—to wit, robbery with homicide—under paragraph 1, article 503 of the Penal Code,  committed with the  aggravating circumstances  of <em>alevosia</em> and  <em>despoblado</em>, and  sentenced the defendant to death.</p>
<p>The Attorney-General, in his brief, classifies the crime in the same way,  but is of the opinion  that the aggravating circumstance of <em>alevosia</em> is not present.   He recommends, however, that the penalty of death be sustained under rule 1, article 80 of the  Penal Code, for  the reason  that the commission of the crime was accompanied by another aggravating circumstance as found by the court below which was established by an inspection made by the court itself of the place where the bodies were found.</p>
<p>There may be some doubt as to whether the  defendant in this  case can be convicted of the complex  crime of robbery with homicide, in view of the doctrine  laid down by the supreme court of Spain in  its judgments of the 23d of May,  1899, and the 19th of October, 1894.</p>
<p>In the first judgment above referred to that court said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The nature of the crime of robbery as defined in article 515 of the code (502 of the  Philippine Code)  implies violence or intimidation of the persons or the employment of force upon property, as the case may be, at the time of the commission of the crime or in order to facilitate its commission,  and it would not be proper to  consider these circumstances  after  the criminal had fully  accomplished his purpose,  whatever the extent of his acts or the nature of the crime committed may have been.</p>
  <p>"Article 516 (503 of the Philippine Code)  refers to robberies committed  with violence  or  intimidation  of the persons and punishes such offense with a more or less severe penalty according to the importance or consequences of these circumstances upon the theory that the same were present at the very time of the commission of the robbery. The phrase  <em>on account or on the occasion of the robbey'</em> employed in the code not having any other meaning."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And in the second judgment above cited the court said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"It can not be said in the case  at bar that the crime of homicide was committed on account or on the occasion of the robbery, as the latter offense had already been consummated  when the  killing  occurred.  Gonzales killed Perez when  he went back to the house robbed, for the purpose of getting a shotgun which he had left there.   The existence of the juridical relation either direct or indirect required by the  nature of the complex crime defined and penalized in article 5.16, case 1 (503, par. 1 of the Philippine Code) is not clearly established by the evidence."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But in our opinion this doctrine is not applicable to the case at bar, where a direct relation between the robbery and the killing has been sufficiently shown.   In. the two  cases referred to  in the above-quoted decisions of the  supreme court of Spain it appears that after the robbery had been completed without any difficulty or further consequence, one of the robbers committed an act which had not the slightest relation to the robbery, which, as above stated, had  already been  consummated.   In the first case  it developed that one of the robbers  returned to the place where the robbery  had been  committed for the purpose of closing the gate of a corral from which the cattle had been stolen, in order that the remaining cattle might not get out.  He was seen by the man in charge of the cattle, who,  up to  that time,  had not noticed  that any of the cattle had been stolen.  He upbraided the robber, and the latter assaulted  and killed him.  In the second  case the robber went back to the house in order to get a shotgun which he had left there and met a person who reproached him, whereupon a fight ensued in  which  the latter  was killed.  The return of the robber in order to close the gate of the corral in the first instance, and in order to get the shotgun which he had forgotten in the second instance, were acts absolutely independent of the robbery, whereas in the case at bar the robbers, while still on the ground, as soon as they noticed that the deceased, Alconaba, and the boy had freed themselves, again attacked  them with their bolos, killing one of them, one of the robbers having been  also killed, and his head severed from his body and hid away, probably for the purpose of preventing identification.  On account of and on the occasion of the robbery and in  order to conceal the same the crime of homicide was committed.</p>
<p>The judgment of  the supreme court of Spain bearing upon the case at bar is the one of the 21st of August, 1873, in which  the  robbery and  the  killing,  according to the appellant, should not be considered together as constituting one single but two separate acts.  This was a case where a priest was robbed of the money which he carried with him at the time, and tied to a tree.  One of the robbers fearing that he was recognized by the priest turned back, shot him, and cut his throat with a razor.  The supreme court said: "The two crimes of robbery and homicide herein charged constituted  one single offense and the court below in so holding committed no error upon which this appeal might be sustained."</p>
<p>The judgment of the court below is  accordingly hereby affirmed, except in so far as  it is therein declared that the crime was  committed with the aggravating circumstance of alcvmia, as to which  there  is no evidence to support such a circumstance, the defendant to pay the costs of these proceedings and to  indemnify the heirs  of the deceased, Alconaba, in the sum of P1,000, Philippine currency.  After the expiration  of ten days from the rendition of final  judgment the case will be  remanded to the court below for execution.   So ordered.</p>
