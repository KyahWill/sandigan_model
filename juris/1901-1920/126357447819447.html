				G.R. No. 3094, December 12, 1906</h4>
				<H3>FRED  SPARREVOHN, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE,  VS.  EMIL  M. BACHRACH ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The plaintiff brought this  action  upon  the following<br>
  document:</p>
<p align="center">"$271.<br>
  "I.O.U.<br>
  "Two Hundred and Seventy-one.<br>
  "(Sgd.)  E. H. B."</p>
<p>The defendant in his answer alleged that this obligation was given for money lost at a game of poker and that that game was a game of  chance prohibited by the law.   Article 1798  of the Civil Code is as follows:</p>
<p>"The  law does not permit any  action to claim what is won in  a game of chance,  luck, or hazard; but the person who loses can not recover what he may have voluntarily paid, unless there should have been fraud, or should he be a minor or incapacitated to administer his property."</p>
<p>While the defendant, as has been said, alleged that the game of poker was a game  covered by article 1798, there was no proof in the case to support this allegation.   No evidence was offered to show the  nature of the game.  Without such evidence the court can not assume that it was a game of <em>suerte, envite, or azar.</em></p>
<p>It will be noticed that no consideration is mentioned in this obligation.   By the terms of article 1277 of the Civil Code, therefore, it is presumed that a consideration existed and that it was lawful, unless the  defendant  prove  the contrary.   The  case differs in this respect from the case of Lichauco <em>vs</em>.  Martinez<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> (5 Off.  Gaz., 89), decided November 6, 1906, in which a consideration was  expressed, which consideration was  proven by  the defendant to be false.</p>
<p>The judgment of the court below in favor of the plaintiff is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against  the  appellant.</p>
<p>After expiration of twenty days let judgment be entered in  accordance herewith,  and  ten days  thereafter  let  the record be remanded to the court from whence it came  for proper action.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Carson,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ., </em>concur.</p>
<em>Johnson, J.,</em> did not sit in this case.<br>
