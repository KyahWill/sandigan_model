				<H3>F. C. FISHER, PLAINTIFF, VS. YANGCO STEAMSHIP COMPANY, J. S. STANLEY, AS ACTING COLLECTOR OF CUSTOMS OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, IGNACIO VILLAMOE, AS ATTORNEY-GENERAL OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, AND W. H. BISHOP, AS PROSECUTING ATTORNEY OF THE CITY OF MANILA, RESPONDENTS.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The real question involved in these proceedings is 
whether the refusal of the owners and officers of a steam vessel, duly 
licensed to engage in the coastwise trade of the Philippine Islands and 
engaged in that trade as a common carrier, to accept for carriage 
"dynamite, powder or other explosives" from any and all shippers who may
 offer such explosives for carriage can be held to be a lawful act 
without regard to any question as to the conditions under which such 
explosives are offered for carriage, or as to the suitableness of the 
vessel for the transportation of such explosives, or as to the 
possibility that the refusal to accept such articles of commerce in a 
particular case may have the effect of subjecting any person or locality
 or the traffic in such explosives to an undue, unreasonable or 
unnecessary prejudice or discrimination.<br><br>Summarized briefly, the 
complaint alleges that plaintiff is a stockholder in the Yangco 
Steamship Company, the owner of a large number of steam vessels, duly 
licensed to engage in the coastwise trade of the Philippine Islands; 
that on or about June 10, 1912, the directors of the company adopted a 
resolution which was thereafter ratified and affirmed by the 
shareholders of the company, "expressly declaring and providing that the
 classes of merchandise to be carried by the company in its business as a
 common carrier do not include dynamite, powder or other explosives, and
 expressly prohibiting the officers, agents and servants of the company 
from offering to carry, accepting for carriage or carrying said 
dynamite, powder or other explosives;" that thereafter the respondent 
Acting Collector of Customs demanded and required of the company the 
acceptance and carriage of such explosives; that he has refused and 
suspended the issuance of the necessary clearance documents of the 
vessels of the company unless and until the company consents to accept 
such explosives for carriage; that plaintiff is advised and believes 
that should the company decline to accept such explosives for carriage, 
the respondent Attorney-General of the Philippine Islands and the 
reÂ¬spondent prosecuting attorney of the city of Manila intend to 
institute proceedings under the penal provisions of sections 4, 5, and 6
 of Act No. 98 of the Philippine Commission against the company, its 
managers, agents and servants, to enforce the requirements of the Acting
 Collector of Customs as to the acceptance of such explosives for 
carriage; that notwithstanding the demands of the plaintiff stockholder,
 the manager, agents and servants of the company decline and refuse to 
cease the carriage of such explosives, on the ground that by reason of 
the severity of the penalties with which they are threatened upon 
failure to carry such explosives, they cannot subject themselves to "the
 ruinous consequences which would inevitably result" from failure on 
their part to obey the demands and requirements of the Acting Collector 
of Customs as to the acceptance for carriage of explosives; that 
plaintiff believes that the Acting Collector of Customs erroneously 
construes the provisions of Act No. 98 in holding that they require the 
company to accept such explosives for carriage notwithstanding the above
 mentioned resolution of the directors and stockholders of the company, 
and that if the Act does in fact require the company to carry such 
explosives it is to that extent unconstitutional and void; that 
notwithstanding this belief of complainant as to the true meaning of the
 Act, the questions involved cannot be raised by the refusal of the 
company or its agents to comply with the demands of the Acting Collector
 of Customs, without the risk of irreparable loss and damage resulting 
from his refusal to facilitate the documentation of the company's 
vessels, and without assuming a risk of pains and penalties under the 
drastic provisions of the Act which prohibit any attempt on the part of 
the company to test the questions involved by refusing to accept such 
explosives for carriage.<br><br>The prayer of the complaint is as 
follows:<br><blockquote>"Wherefore your petitioner prays to this 
honorable court as follows:<br><br>"First. That to the due hearing of 
the above entitled action be issued a writ of prohibition perpetually 
restraining the respondent Yangco Steamship Company, its appraisers, 
agents, servants or other representatives from accepting to carry and 
from carrying, in steamers of said company dynamite, powder or other 
explosive substance, in accordance with the resolution of the board of 
directors and of the shareholders of said company.<br><br>"Second. That a
 writ of prohibition be issued perpetually enjoining the respondent J. 
S. Stanley as Acting Collector of Customs of the Philippine Islands, his
 successors, deputies, servants or other representatives, from 
obligating the said Yangco Steamship Company, by any means whatever, to 
carry dynamite, powder or other explosive substance.<br><br>"Third. That
 a writ of prohibition be issued perpetually&nbsp; enjoining the respondent 
Ignacio Villamor as Attorney-General of the Philippine Islands, and W. 
H. Bishop as prosecuting attorney of the city of Manila, their deputies,
 representatives or employees, from accusing the said Yangco Steamship 
Company, its officers, agents or servants, of the violation of Act No. 
98 by reason of the failure or omission of the said company to accept 
for carriage or to carry dynamite, powder or other explosive.<br><br>"Fourth.
 That the petitioner be granted such other remedy as may be meet and 
proper."</blockquote>To this complaint the respondents demurred,
 and we are of opinion that the demurrer must be sustained, on the 
ground that the complaint does not set forth facts sufficient to 
constitute a cause of action.<br><br>It will readily be seen that 
plaintiff seeks in these proceedings to enjoin the steamship company 
from accepting for carriage on any of its vessels, dynamite, powder or 
other explosives, under any conditions whatsoever; to prohibit the 
Collector of Customs and the prosecuting officers of the government from
 all attempts to compel the company to accept such explosives for 
carriage on any of its vessels under any conditions whatsoever; and to 
prohibit these officials from any attempt to invoke the penal provisions
 of Act No. 98, in any case of a refusal by the company or its officers 
so to do; and this without regard to the conditions as to safety and so 
forth under which such explosives are offered for carriage, and without 
regard also to any question as to the suitableness for the 
transportation of such explosives of the particular vessel upon which 
the shipper offers them for carriage; and further without regard to any 
question as to whether such conduct on the part of the steamship company
 and its officers involves in any instance an undue, unnecessary or 
unreasonable discrimination to the prejudice of any person, locality or 
particular kind of traffic.<br><br>There are no allegations in the 
complaint that for some special and sufficient reasons all or indeed any
 of the company's vessels are unsuitable for the business of 
transporting explosives; or that shippers have declined or will in 
future decline to comply with such reasonable regulations and to take 
such reasonable precautions as may be necessary and proper to secure the
 'safety of the vessels of the company in transporting such explosives. 
Indeed the contention of petitioner is that a common carrier in the 
Philippine Islands may decline to accept for carriage any shipment of 
merchandise of a class which it expressly or impliedly declines to 
accept from all shippers alike, because, as he contends "the duty of a 
common carrier to carry for all who offer arises from the public 
profession he has made, and is limited by it."<br><br>In support of this
 contention counsel cites a number of English and American authorities, 
discussing and applying the doctrine of the common law with reference to
 common carriers. But it is unnecessary now to decide whether, in the 
absence of statute, the principles on which the American and English 
cases were decided would be applicable in this jurisdiction. The duties 
and liabilities of common carriers in this jurisdiction are defined and 
fully set forth in Act No. 98 of the Philippine Commission, and, until 
and unless that statute be declared invalid or unconstitutional, we are 
bound by its provisions.<br><br>Sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Act are as 
follows:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 2. It shall be unlawful for any common 
carrier engaged in the transportation of passengers or property as above
 set forth to make or give any unnecessary or unreasonable preference or
 advantage to any particular person, company, firm, corporation or 
locality, or any particular kind of traffic in any respect whatsoever, 
or to subject any particular person, company, firm, corporation or 
locality, or any particular kind of traffic, to any undue or 
unreasonable prejudice or discrimination whatsoever, and such unjust 
preference or discrimination is also hereby prohibited and declared to 
be unlawful.<br><br>"SEC. 3. No common carrier engaged in the carriage 
of passengers or property as aforesaid shall, under any pretense 
whatsoever, fail or refuse to receive for carriage, and as promptly as 
it is able to do so without discrimination, to carry any person or 
property offering for carriage, and in the order in which such persons 
or property are offered for carriage, nor shall any such common carrier 
enter into any arrangement, contract or agreement with any other person 
or corporation whereby the latter is given an exclusive or preferential 
privilege over any other person or persons to control or monopolize the 
carriage of any class or kind of property to the exclusion or partial 
exclusion of any other person or persons, and the entering into any such
 arrangement, contract or agreement, under any form or pretense 
whatsoever, is hereby prohibited and declared to be unlawful.<br><br>"SEC.
 4. Any willful violation of the provisions of this Act by any common 
carrier engaged in the transportation of passengers or property as 
hereinbefore set forth is hereby declared to be punishable by a fine not
 exceeding five thousand dollars money of the United States, or by 
imprisonment not exceeding two years, or both, within the discretion of 
the court."</blockquote>The validity of this Act has been questioned on 
various grounds, and it is vigorously contended that in so far as it 
imposes any obligation on a common carrier to accept for carriage 
merchandise of a class which he makes no public profession to carry, or 
which he has expressly or impliedly announced his intention to decline 
to accept for carriage from all shippers alike, it is ultra vires, 
unconstitutional and void.<br><br>We may dismiss without extended 
discussion any argument or contention as to the invalidity of the 
statute based on alleged absurdities inherent in its provisions or on 
alleged unreasonable or impossible requirements which may be read into 
it by a strained construction of its terms.<br><br>We agree with counsel
 for petitioner that the provision of the Act which prescribes that, "No
 common carrier * * * shall, under any pretense whatsoever, fail or 
refuse to receive for carriage, and * * * to carry any person or 
property offering for carriage," is not to be construed in its literal 
sense and without regard to the context, so as to impose an imperative 
duty on all common carriers to accept for carriage, and to carry all and
 any kind of freight which may be offered for carriage without regard to
 the facilities which they may have at their disposal. The legislator 
could not have intended and did not intend to prescribe that a common 
carrier running passenger automobiles for hire must transport coal in 
his machines; nor that the owner of a tank steamer, expressly 
constructed in small watertight compartments for the carriage of crude 
oil must accept a load of cattle or of logs in the rough; nor that any 
common carrier must accept and carry contraband articles, such as opium,
 morphine, cocaine, or the like, the mere possession of which is 
declared to be a criminal offense; nor that common carriers must accept 
eggs offered for transportation in paper parcels or any merchandise 
whatever so defectively packed as to entail upon the company 
unreasonable and unnecessary care or risks.<br><br>Read in connection 
with its context this, as well as all the other mandatory and 
prohibitory provisions of the statute, was clearly intended merely to 
forbid failures or refusals to receive persons or property for carriage 
involving any "unnecessary or unreasonable preference or advantage to 
any particular person, company, firm, corporation or locality, or any 
particular kind of traffic in any respect whatsoever," or which would 
"subject any particular person, company, firm, corporation or locality, 
or any particular kind of traffic to any undue or unreasonable prejudice
 or discrimination whatsoever."<br><br>The question, then, of construing
 and applying the statute, in cases of alleged violations of its 
provisions, always involves a consideration as to whether the acts 
complained of had the effect of making or giving an "unreasonable or 
unnecessary preference or advantage" to any person, locality or 
particular kind of traffic, or of subjecting any person, locality, or 
particular kind of traffic to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or 
discrimination.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is very clear therefore that the language of the 
statute itself refutes any contention as to its invalidity based on the 
alleged unreasonableness of its mandatory or prohibitory provisions.<br><br>So
 also we may dismiss without much discussion the contentions as to the 
invalidity of the statute, which are based on the alleged excessive 
severity of the penalties prescribed for violation of its provisions. 
Upon general principles it is peculiarly and exclusively within the 
province of the legislator to prescribe the pains and penalties which 
may be imposed upon persons convicted of violations of the laws in force
 within his territorial jurisdiction. With the exercise of his 
discretion in this regard the courts have nothing to do, save only in 
cases where it is alleged that excessive fines or cruel and unusual 
punishments have been prescribed, and even in such cases the courts will
 not presume to interfere in the absence of the clearest and most 
convincing argument and proof in support of such contentions. (Weems <i>vs.</i>
 United States, 217 U. S., 349; U. S. <i>vs.</i> Pico, 18 Phil. Rep., 
386.) We need hardly add that there is no ground upon which to rest a 
contention that the penalties prescribed in the statute under 
consideration are either excessive or cruel and unusual, in the sense in
 which these terms are used in the organic legislation in force in the 
Philippine Islands.<br><br>But it is contended that on account of the 
penalties prescribed the statute should be held invalid upon the 
principles announced in <i>Ex parte</i> Young (209 U. S., 123, 147, 148)
 ; Cotting <i>vs.</i> Godard (183 U. S., 79, 102) ; Mercantile Trust Co.
 <i>vs.</i> Texas Co. (5.1 Fed., 529) ; Louisville Ry. <i>vs.</i> McCord
 (103 Fed., 216) ; Cons. Gas Co. <i>vs.</i> Mayer (416 Fed., 150). We 
are satisfied however that the reasoning of those cases is not 
applicable to the statute under consideration. The principles announced 
in those decisions are fairly indicated in the following citations found
 in petitioner's brief:<br><blockquote>"But when the legislature, in an 
effort to prevent any inquiry of the validity of a particular statute, 
so burdens any&nbsp; challenge thereof in the courts that the party affected 
is necessarily constrained to submit rather than take the chances of the
 penalties imposed, then it becomes a serious question whether the party
 is not deprived of the equal protection of the laws. (Cotting <i>vs.</i>
 Godard, 183 U. S., 79, 102.)<br><br>"It may therefore be said that when
 the penalties for dis-obedience are by fines so enormous and 
imprisonment so severe as to intimidate the company and its officers 
from resorting to the courts to test the validity of the legislation, 
the result is the same as if the law in terms prohibited the company 
from seeking judicial construction of laws which deeply affect its 
rights.<br><br>"It is urged that there is no principle upon which to 
base the claim that a person is entitled to disobey a statute at least 
once, for the purpose of testing its validity, without subjecting 
himself to the penalties for disobedience provided by the statute in 
case it is valid. This is not an accurate statement of the case. 
Ordinarily a law creating offenses in the nature of misdemeanors or 
felonies relates to a subject over which the jurisdiction of the 
legislature is complete in any event. In the case, however, of the 
establishment of certain rates without any hearing, the validity of such
 rates necessarily depends upon whether they are high enough to permit 
at least some return upon the investment (how much it is not now 
necessary to state), and an inquiry as to that fact is a proper subject 
of judicial investigation. If it turns out that the rates are too low 
for that purpose, then they are illegal. Now, to impose upon a party 
interested the burden of obtaining a judicial decision of such a 
question (no prior hearing having ever been given) only upon the 
condition that, if unsuccessful, he must suffer imprisonment and pay 
fines, as provided in these acts, is, in effect, to close up all 
approaches to the courts, and thus prevent any hearing upon the question
 whether the rates as provided by the acts are not too low, and 
therefore invalid. The distinction is obvious between a case where the 
validity of the act depends upon the existence of a fact which can be 
determined only after investigation of a very complicated and technical 
character, and the ordinary case of a statute upon a subject requiring 
no such investigation, and over which the jurisdiction of the 
legislature is complete in any event.<br><br>"We hold, therefore, that 
the provisions of the acts relating to the enforcement of the rates, 
either for freight or passsengers, by imposing such enormous fines and 
possible imprisonment as a result of an unsuccessful effort to test the 
validity of the laws themselves, are unconstitutional on their face, 
without regard to the question of the insufficiency of those rates. (<i>Ex
 parte</i> Young, 209 U. S., 123, 147, 148.)"</blockquote>An examination
 of the general provisions of our statute, of the circumstances under 
which it was enacted, the mischief which it sought to remedy and of the 
nature of the penalties prescribed for violations of its terms convinces
 us that, unlike the statutes under consideration in the above cited 
cases, its enactment involved no attempt to prevent comÂ¬mon carriers 
"from resorting to the courts to test the validity of the legislation;" 
no "effort to prevent any inquiry" as to its validity. It imposes no 
arbitrary obligation upon the company to do or to refrain from doing 
anything. It makes no attempt to compel such carriers to do business at a
 fixed or arbitrarily designated rate, at the risk of separate criminal 
prosecutions for every demand of a higher or a different rate. Its 
penalties can be imposed only upon proof of "unreasonable," 
"unnecessary" and "unjust" discriminations, and range from a maximum 
which is certainly not excessive for willful, deliberate and 
contumacious violations of its provisions by a great and powerful 
corporation, to a minimum which may be a merely nominal fine. With so 
wide a range of discretion conferred upon the courts, there is no 
substantial basis for a contention on the part of any common carrier 
that it or its officers are "intimidated from resorting to the courts to
 test the validity" of the provisions of the statute prohibiting such 
"unreasonable," "unnecessary" and "unjust" discriminations, or to test 
in any particular case whether a given course of conduct does in fact 
involve such discrimination. We will not presume, for the purpose of 
declaring the statute invalid, that there is so real a danger that the 
Courts of First Instance and this court on appeal will abuse the 
discretion thus conferred upon us, as to intimidate any common carrier, 
acting in good faith, from resorting to the courts to test the validity 
of the statute. Legislative enactments, penalizing unreasonable 
discriminations, unreasonable restraints of trade, and unreasonable 
conduct in various forms of human activity are so familiar and have been
 so frequently sustained in the courts, as to render extended discussion
 unnecessary to refute any contention as to the invalidity of the 
statute under consideration, merely because it imposes upon the carrier 
the obligation of adopting one of various courses of conduct open to it,
 at the risk of incurring a prescribed penalty in the event that the 
course of conduct actually adopted by it should be held to have involved
 an unreasonable, unnecessary or unjust discrimination. Applying the 
test announced in <i>Ex parte</i> Young, <i>supra</i>, it will be seen 
that the validity of the Act does not depend upon "the existence of a 
fact which can be determined only after investigation of a very 
complicated and technical character," and that "the jurisdiction of the 
legislature" over the subject with which the statute deals "is complete 
in any event." There can be no real question as to the plenary power of 
the legislature to prohibit and to penalize the making of undue, 
unreasonable and unjust discriminations by common carriers to the 
prejudice of any person, locality or particular kind of traffic. (See 
Munn <i>vs.</i> Illinois, 94 U. S., 113, and other cases hereinafter 
cited in support of this proposition.)<br><br>Counsel for petitioner 
contends also that the statute, if construed so as to deny the right of 
the steamship company to elect at will whether or not it will engage in a
 particular business, such as that of carrying explosives, is 
unconstitutional "because it is a confiscation of property, a taking of 
the carrier's property without due process of law," and because it 
deprives him of his liberty by compelling him to engage in business 
against his will. The argument continues as follows:<br><br>"To require 
of a carrier, as a condition to his continuing in said business, that he
 must carry anything and everything is to render useless the facilities 
he may have for the carriage of certain lines of freight. It would be 
almost as complete a confiscation of such facilities as if the same were
 destroyed. Their value as a means of livelihood would be utterly taken 
away. The law is a prohibition to him to continue in business; the 
alternative is to get out or to go into some other businessâthe same 
alternative as was offered in the case of the Chicago &amp; N. W. Ry. <i>vs.</i>
 Dey (35 Fed. Rep., 866, 880), and which was there commented on as 
follows: <br><blockquote>" 'Whatever of force there may be in such 
arguments, as applied to mere personal property capable of removal and 
use elsewhere, or m" other business, it is wholly without force as 
against railroad corporations, so large a proportion of whose investment
 is in the soil and fixtures appertaining thereto, which cannot be 
removed. For a government, whether that government be a single sovereign
 or one of the majority, to say to an individual who has invested his 
means in so laudable an enterprise as the construction of a railroad, 
one which tends so much to the wealth and prosperity of the community, 
that, if he finds that the rates imposed will cause him to do business 
at a loss, he may quit business, and abandon that road, is the very 
irony of despotism. Apples of Sodom were fruit of joy in comparison. 
Reading, as I do, in the preamble of the Federal Constitution, that it 
was ordained to "establish justice," I can never believe that it is 
within the power of state or nation thus practically to confiscate the 
property of an individual invested in and used for a purpose in which 
even the Argus eyes of the police power can see nothing injurious to 
public morals, public health, or the general welfare. I read also in the
 first section of the bill of rights of this state that "all men are by 
nature free and equal, and have certain inalienable rights, among which 
are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty, acquiring, 
possessing, and protecting property, and pursuing and obtaining safety 
and happiness;" and I know that, while that remains as the supreme law 
of the state, no legislature can directly or indirectly lay its 
withering or destroying hand on a single dollar invested in the 
legitimate business of transportation.' " (Chicago &amp; N. W. Ry. <i>vs.</i>
 Dey, 35 Fed. Rep., 866, 880.)</blockquote>It is manifest, however, that
 this contention is directed against a construction of the statute, 
which, as we have said, is not warranted by its terms. As we have 
already indiÂ¬cated, the statute does not "require of a carrier, as a 
condition to his continuing in said business, that he must carry 
anything and everything," and thereby "render useless the facilities he 
may have for the carriage of certain lines of freight." It merely 
forbids failures or refusals to receive persons or property for carriage
 which have the effect of giving an "unreasonable or unnecessary 
preference or advantage" to any person, locality or particular kind of 
traffic, or of subjecting any person, locality or particular kind of 
traffic to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or discrimination.<br><br>Counsel
 expressly admits that the statute, "as a prohibition against 
discrimination is a fair, reasonable and valid exercise of government," 
and that "it is necessary and proper that such discrimination be 
prohibited and prevented," but he contends that "on the other hand there
 is no reasonable warrant nor valid excuse for depriving a person of his
 liberty by requiring him to engage in business against his will. If he 
has a rolling boat, unsuitable and unprofitable for passenger trade, he 
may devote it to lumber carrying. To prohibit him from using it unless 
it is fitted out with doctors and stewards and staterooms to carry 
passengers would be an invalid confiscation of his property. A carrier 
may limit his business to the branches thereof that suit his 
convenience. If his wagon be old, or the route dangerous, he may avoid 
liability for loss of passengers' lives and limbs by carrying freight 
only. If his vehicles require expensive pneumatic tires, unsuitable for 
freight transportation, he may nevertheless carry passengers. The only 
limitation upon his action that it is competent for the governing 
authority to impose is to require him to treat all alike. His 
limitations must apply to all, and they must be established limitations.
 He cannot refuse to carry a case of red <i>jusi</i> on the ground that 
he has carried for others only <i>jusi</i> that was green, or blue, or 
black. But he can refuse to carry red <i>jusi</i>, if he has publicly 
professed such a limitation upon his business and held himself out as 
unwilling to carry the same for anyone."<br><br>To this it is sufficient
 answer to say that there is nothing in the statute which would deprive 
any person of his liberty "by requiring him to engage in business 
against his will." The prohibitions of the statute against undue, 
unnecessary or unreasonable preferences and discriminations are merely 
the reasonable regulations which the legislator has seen fit to 
prescribe (for the conduct of the business in which the carrier is 
engaged of his own free will and accord. In so far as the self-imposed 
limitations by the carrier upon the business conducted by him, in the 
various examples given by counsel, do not involve an unreasonable or 
unnecessary discrimination the statute would not control his action in 
any wise whatever. It operates only in cases involving such unreasonable
 or unnecessary preferences or discrimiÂ¬nations. Thus in the 
hypothetical case suggested by the petitioner, a carrier engaged in the 
carriage of green, blue or black <i>jusi</i>, and duly equipped therefor
 would manifestly be guilty of "giving an unnecessary and unreasonable 
preference to a particular kind of traffic" and of subjecting to "an 
undue and unreasonable prejudice a particular kind of traffic," should 
he decline to carry red <i>jusi</i>, to the prejudice of a particular 
shipper or of those engaged in the manufacture of that kind of <i>jusi</i>,
 basing his refusal on the ground of "mere whim or caprice" or of mere 
personal convenience. So a public carrier of passengers would not be 
permitted under this statute to absolve himself from liability for a 
refusal to carry a Chinaman, a Spaniard, an American, a Filipino, or a <i>mestizo</i>
 by proof that from "mere whim or caprice or personal scruple," or to 
suit his own convenience, or in the hope of increasing his business and 
thus making larger profits, he had publicly announced his intention not 
to carry one or other of these classes of passengers.<br><br>The nature 
of the business of a common carrier as a public employment is such that 
it is clearly within the power of the state to impose such just and 
reasonable regulations thereon in the interest of the public as the 
legislator' may deem proper. Of course such regulations must not have 
the effect of depriving an owner of his property without due process of 
law, nor of confiscating or appropriating private property without just 
compensation, nor of limiting or prescribing irrevocably vested rights 
or privileges lawfully acquired under a charter or franchise. But aside 
from such constitutional limitations, the determination of the nature 
and extent of the regulations which should be prescribed rests in the 
hands of the legislator.<br><br>Common carriers exercise a sort of 
public office', and have duties to perform in which the public is 
interested. Their business is, therefore, affected with a public 
interest, and is subject of public regulation. (New Jersey Steam Nav. 
Co. <i>vs.</i> Merchants Bank, 6 How., 344, 382; Munn <i>vs.</i> 
Illinois, 94 U. S., 113, 130.) Indeed, this right of regulation is so 
far beyond question that it is well settled that the power of the state 
to exercise legislative control over railroad companies and other 
carriers "in all respects necessary to protect the public against 
danger, injustice and oppression" may be exercised through boards of 
commissioners. (New York etc. R. Co. <i>vs.</i> Bristol, 151 U. S., 556,
 571; Connecticut etc. R. Co. <i>vs.</i> Woodruff, 153 U. S., 689.)<br><br>Regulations
 limiting the number of passengers that may be carried in a particular 
vehicle or steam vessel, or forbidding the loading of a vessel beyond a 
certain point, or prescribing the number and qualifications of the 
personnel in the employ of a common carrier, or forbidding unjust 
discrimination as to rates, all tend to limit and restrict his liberty 
and to control to some degree the free exercise of his discretion in the
 conduct of his business.&nbsp; But since the Granger cases were decided by 
the Supreme Court of the United States no one questions the power of the
 legislator to prescribe such reasonable regulations upon property 
clothed with a public interest as he may deem expedient or necessary to 
protect the public against danger, injustice or oppression. (Munn <i>vs.</i>
 Illinois, 94 U. S., 113, 130; Chicago etc. R. Co. <i>vs.</i> Cutts, 94 
U. S., 155; Budd <i>vs.</i> New York, 143 U. S., 517; Cotting <i>vs.</i>
 Godard, 183 U. S., 79.) The right to enter the public employment as a 
common carrier and to offer one's services to the public for hire does 
not carry with it the right to conduct that business as one pleases, 
without regard to the interests of the public and free from such 
reasonable and just regulations as may be prescribed for the protection 
of the public from the reckless or careless indifference of the carrier 
as to the public welfare and for the prevention of unjust and 
unreasonable discrimination of any kind whatsoever in the performance of
 the carrier's duties as a servant of the public.<br><br>Business of 
certain kinds, including the business of a common carrier, holds such a 
peculiar relation to the public interest that there is superinduced upon
 it the right of public regulation. (Budd <i>vs.</i> New York, 143 U. 
S., 517, 533.) When private property is "affected with a public interest
 it ceases to be <i>juris privati</i> only." Property becomes clothed 
with a public interest when used in a manner to make it of public 
consequence and affect the community at large. "When, therefore, one 
devotes his property to a use in which the public has an interest, he, 
in effect, grants to the public an interest in that use, and must submit
 to be controlled by the public for the common good, to the extent of 
the interest he has thus created. He may withdraw his grant by 
discontinuing the use, but so long as he maintains the use he must 
submit to control." (Munn <i>vs.</i> Illinois, 94 U. S., 113; Georgia R.
 &amp; Bkg. Co. <i>vs.</i> Smith, 128 U. S., 174; Budd <i>vs.</i> New 
York, 143 U. S., 517; Louisville etc. Ry. Co. <i>vs.</i> Kentucky, 161 
U. S., 677, 695.)<br><br>Of course this power to regulate is not a power
 to destroy, and limitation is not the equivalent of confiscation. Under
 pretense of regulating fares and freight the state can not require a 
railroad corporation to carry persons or property without reward. Nor 
can it do that which in law amounts to a taking of private property for 
public use without just compensation, or without due process of law. 
(Chicago etc. R. Co. <i>vs.</i> Minnesota, 134 U. S., 418; Minneapolis 
Eastern R. Co. <i>vs.</i> Minnesota, 134 U. S., 467.) But the judiciary 
ought not to interfere with regulations established under legislative 
sanction unless they are so plainly and palpably unreasonable as to make
 their enforcement equivalent to the taking of property for public use 
without such compensation as under all the circumstances is just both to
 the owner and to the public, that is, judicial interference should 
never occur unless the case presents, clearly and beyond all doubt, such
 a flagrant attack upon the rights of property under the guise of 
regulations as to compel the court to say that the regulation in 
question will have the effect to deny just compensation for private 
property taken for the public use. (Chicago etc. R. Co. <i>vs.</i> 
Wellman, 143 U. S., 339; Smyth <i>vs.</i> Ames, 169 U. S., 466, 524; 
Henderson Bridge Co. <i>vs.</i> Henderson City, 173 U. S., 592, 614.)<br><br>Under
 the common law of England it was early recognized that common carriers 
owe to the public the duty, of carrying indifferently for all who may 
employ them, and in the order in which application is made, and without 
discrimination as to terms. True, they were allowed to restrict their 
business so as to exclude particular classes of goods, but as to the 
kinds of property which the carrier was in the habit of carrying in the 
prosecution of his business he was bound to serve all customers alike 
(State <i>vs.</i> Cincinnati etc. R. Co., 47 Ohio St., 130, 134, 138; 
Louisville etc. Ry. Co. <i>vs.</i> Queen City Coal Co., 13 Ky. L. Rep., 
832); and it is to be observed in passing that these common law rules 
are themselves regulations controlling, limiting and prescribing the 
conditions under which common carriers were permitted to conduct their 
business. (Munn <i>vs.</i> Illinois, 94 U. S., 113,133.)<br><br>It was 
found, in the course of time, that the correction of abuses which had 
grown up with the enormously increasing business of common carriers 
necessitated the adoption of statutory regulations controlling the 
business of common carriers, and imposing severe and drastic penalties 
for violations of their terms. In England, the Railway Clauses 
Consolidation Act was enacted in 1845, the Railway and Canal Traffic Act
 in 1854, and since the passage of those Acts much additional 
legislation has been adopted tending to limit and control the conduct of
 their business by common carriers. In the United States, the business 
of common carriers has been subjected to a great variety of statutory 
regulations. Among others Congress enacted "The Interstate Commerce Act"
 (1887) and its amendments, and the Elkins Act as amended (1906) ; and 
most if not all of the States of the Union have adopted similar 
legislation regulating the business of common carriers within their 
respective jurisdictions. Unending litigation has arisen under these 
statutes and their amendments, but nowhere has the right of the state to
 prescribe just and reasonable regulations controlling and limiting the 
conduct of the business of common carriers in the public interest and 
for the general welfare been successfully challenged, though of course 
there has been wide divergence of opinion as to the reasonableness, the 
validity and legality of many of the regulations actually adopted.<br><br>The
 power of the Philippine legislator to prohibit and to penalize all and 
any unnecessary or unreasonable dis-criminations by common carriers may 
be maintained upon the same reasoning which justified the enactment by 
the Parliament of England and the Congress of the United States of the 
above mentioned statutes prohibiting and penalizing the granting of 
certain preferences and dis-criminations in those countries. As we have 
said before, we find nothing confiscatory or unreasonable in the 
conditions imposed in the Philippine statute" upon the business of 
common carriers. Correctly construed they do not force him to engage in 
any business against his will or to make use of his facilities in a 
manner or for a purpose for which they are not reasonably adapted. It is
 only when he offers his facilities as a common carrier to the public 
for hire, that the statute steps in and prescribes that he must treat 
all alike, that he may not pick and choose which customer he will serve,
 and, specifically, that he shall not make any undue or unreasonable 
preferences or discriminations whatsoever to the prejudice not only of 
any person or locality but also of any particular kind of traffic.<br><br>The
 legislator having enacted a regulation prohibiting common carriers from
 giving unnecessary or unreasonable preferences or advantages to any 
particular kind of traffic or subjecting any particular kind of traffic 
to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or discrimination whatsoever, it 
is clear that whatever may have been the rule at the common law, common 
carriers in this jurisdiction cannot lawfully decline to accept a 
particular class of goods for carriage, to the prejudice of the traffic 
in those goods, unless it appears that for some sufficient reason the 
discrimination against the traffic in .such goods is reasonable and 
necessary. Mere whim or prejudice will not suffice. The grounds for the 
discrimination must be substantial ones, such as will justify the courts
 in holding the discrimination to have been reasonable and necessary 
under all the circumstances of the case.<br><br>The prayer of the 
petition in the case at bar cannot be granted unless we hold that the 
refusal of the defendant steamship company to accept for carriage on any
 of its vessels "dynamite, gunpowder or other explosives" would in no 
instance involve a violation of the provisions of this statute. There 
can be little doubt, however, that cases may and will arise wherein the 
refusal of a vessel "engaged in the coastwise trade of the Philippine 
Islands as a common carrier" to accept such explosives for carriage 
would subject some person, company, firm or corporation, or locality, or
 particular kind of traffic to a certain prejudice or dis-crimination. 
Indeed it cannot be doubted that the refusal of a "steamship company, 
the owner of a large number of vessels" engaged in that trade to receive
 for carriage any such explosives on any of its vessels would subject 
the traffic in such explosives to a manifest prejudice and 
discrimination. The only question to be determined therefore is whether 
such prejudice or discrimination might in any case prove to be undue, 
unnecessary or unreasonable.<br><br>This of course is, in each case, a 
question of fact, and we are of opinion that the facts alleged in the 
complaint are not sufficient to sustain a finding in favor of the 
contentions of the petitioner. It is not alleged in the complaint that 
"dynamite, gunpowder and other explosives" can in no event be 
transported with reasonable safety on board steam vessels engaged in the
 business of common carriers. It is not alleged that all, or indeed any 
of the defendant steamhip company's vessels are unsuited for the 
carriage of such explosives. It is not alleged that the nature of the 
business in which the steamship company is engaged is such, as to 
preclude a finding that a refusal to accept such explosives on any of 
its vessels would subject the traffic in such explosives to an undue and
 unreasonable prejudice and discrimination.<br><br>Plaintiff's 
contention in this regard is as follows:<br><blockquote>"In the present 
case, the respondent company has expressly and publicly renounced the 
carriage of explosives, and expressly excluded the same in terms from 
the business it conducts. This in itself were sufficient, even though 
such exclusion of explosives were based on no other ground than the mere
 whim, caprice or personal scruple of the carrier. It is unnecessary, 
however, to indulge in academic discussion of a moot question, for the 
decision not to carry explosives rests on substantial grounds which are 
self-evident."</blockquote>We think however that the answer to the 
question whether such a refusal to carry explosives involves an 
unnecessary or unreasonable preference or advantage to any person, 
locality or particular kind of traffic or subjects any person, locality 
or particular kind of traffic to an undue or unreasonable prejudice or 
discrimination is by no means "self-evident," and that it is a question 
of fact to be determined by the particular circumstances of each case.<br><br>The
 words "dynamite, powder or other explosives" are broad enough to 
include matches, and other articles of like nature, and may fairly be 
held to include also kerosene oil, gasoline and similar products of a 
highly inflammable and explosive character. Many of these articles of 
merchandise are in the nature of necessities in any country open to 
modern progress and advancement. We are not fully advised as to the 
methods of transportation by which they are made commercially available 
throughout the world, but certain it is that dynamite, gunpowder, 
matches, kerosene oil and gasoline are transported on many vessels 
sailing the high seas. Indeed it is matter of common knowledge that 
common carriers throughout the world transport enormous quantities of 
these explosives, on both land and sea, and there can be little doubt 
that a general refusal of the common carriers in any country to accept 
such explosives for carriage would involve many persons, firms and 
enterprises in utter ruin, and would disastrously affect the interests 
of the public and the general welfare of the community.<br><br>It would 
be going far to say that a refusal by a steam vessel engaged in the 
business of transporting general merchandise as a common carrier to 
accept for carriage a shipment of matches, solely on the ground of the 
dangers incident to the explosive quality of this class of merchandise, 
would not subject the traffic in matches to an unnecessary, undue or 
unreasonable prejudice or discrimination without proof that for some 
special reason the particular vessel is not fitted to carry articles of 
that nature. There may be and doubtless are some vessels engaged in 
business as common carriers of merchandise, which for lack of suitable 
deck space or storage rooms might be justified in declining to carry 
kerosene oil, gasoline, and similar products, even when offered for 
carriage securely packed in cases; and few vessels are equipped to 
transport those products in bulk. But in any case of a refusal to carry 
such products which would subject any person, locality or the traffic in
 such products to any prejudice or discrimination whatsoever, it would 
be necessary to hear evidence before making an affirmative finding that 
such prejudice or discrimination was or was not unnecessary, undue or 
unreasonable. The making of such a finding would involve a consideration
 of the suitability of the vessel for the transportation of such 
products; the reasonable possibility of danger or disaster resulting 
from their transportation in the form and under the conditions in which 
they are offered for carriage; the general nature of the business done 
by the carrier and, in a word, all the attendant circumstances which 
might affect the question of the reasonable necessity for the refusal by
 the carrier to undertake the transportation of this class of 
merchandise.<br><br>But it is contended that whatever the rule may be as
 to other explosives, the exceptional power and violence of dynamite and
 gunpowder in explosion will always furnish the owner of a vessel with a
 reasonable excuse for his failure or refusal to accept them for 
carriage or to carry them on board his boat. We think however that even 
as to dynamite and gunpowder we would not be justified in making such a 
holding unaided by evidence sustaining the proposition that these 
articles can never be carried with reasonable safety on any vessel 
engaged in the business of a common carrier. It is said that dynamite is
 so erratic and uncontrollable in its action that it is impossible to 
assert that it can be handled with safety in any given case. On the 
other hand it is contended that while this may be true of some kinds of 
dynamite, it is a fact that dynamite can be and is manufactured so as to
 eliminate any real danger from explosion during transportation. These 
are of course questions of fact upon which we are not qualified to pass 
judgment without the assistance of expert witnesses who have made 
special studies as to the chemical composition and reactions of the 
different kinds of dynamite, or attained a thorough knowledge of its 
properties as a result of wide experience in its manufacture and 
transportation.<br><br>As we construe the Philippine statute, the mere 
fact that violent and destructive explosions can be obtained by the use 
of dynamite under certain conditions would not be sufficient in itself 
to justify the refusal of a vessel, duly licensed as a common carrier of
 merchandise, to accept it for carriage, if it can be proven that in the
 condition in which it is offered for carriage there is no real danger 
to the carrier, nor reasonable ground to fear that his vessel or those 
on board his vessel will be exposed to unnecessary and unreasonable risk
 in transporting it, having in mind the nature of his business as a 
common carrier engaged in the coastwise trade in the Philippine Islands,
 and his duty as a servant of the public engaged in a public employment.
 So also, if by the exercise of due diligence and the taking of 
reasonable precautions the danger of explosions can be practically 
eliminated, the carrier would not be justified in subjecting the traffic
 in this commodity to prejudice or discrimination by proof that there 
would be a possibility of danger from explosion when no such precautions
 are taken.<br><br>The traffic in dynamite, gunpowder and other 
explosives is vitally essential to the material and general welfare of 
the people of these Islands. If dynamite, gunpowder and other explosives
 are to continue in general use throughout the Philippines, they must be
 transported by water from port to port in the various islands which 
make up the Archipelago. We are satisfied therefore that the refusal by a
 particular vessel, engaged as a common carrier of merchandise in the 
coastwise trade of the Philippine Islands, to accept any or all of these
 explosives for carriage would constitute a violation of the 
prohibitions against discrimiÂ¬nations penalized under the statute, 
unless it can be shown by affirmative evidence that there is so real and
 substantial a danger of disaster necessarily involved in the carriage 
of any or all of these articles of merchandise as to render such refusal
 a due or a necessary or a reasonable exercise of prudence and 
discretion on the part of the shipowner.<br><br>The complaint in the 
case at bar lacking the necessary allegations under this ruling, the 
demurrer must be sustained on the ground that the facts alleged do not 
constitute a cause of action.<br><br>A number of interesting questions 
of procedure are raised and discussed in the briefs of counsel. As to 
all of these questions we expressly reserve our opinion, believing as we
 do that in sustaining the demurrer on the grounds indicated in this 
opinion we are able to dispose of the real issue involved in the 
proceedings without entering upon the discussion of the nice questions 
which it might have been necessary to pass upon had it appeared that the
 facts alleged in the complaint constitute a cause of action.<br><br>We 
think, however, that we should not finally dispose of the case without 
indicating that since the institution of these proceedings the enactment
 of Acts No. 2307 and No. 2362 (creating a Board of Public Utility 
Commissioners and for other purposes) may have materially modified the 
right to institute and maintain such proceedings in this jurisdiction. 
But the demurrer having been formally submitted for judgment before the 
enactment of these statutes, counsel have not been heard in this 
connection. We therefore refrain from any comment upon any questions 
which might be raised as to whether or not there may be another adequate
 and appropriate remedy for the alleged wrong set forth in the 
complaint. Our disposition of the question raised by the demurrer 
renders that unnecessary at this time, though it may not be improper to 
observe that a careful examination of those acts confirms us in the 
holding upon which we base our ruling on this demurrer, that is to say 
"That whatever may have been the rule at the common law, common carriers
 in this jurisdiction cannot lawfully decline to accept a particular 
class of goods for carriage, to the prejudice of the traffic in those 
goods, unless it appears that for some sufficient reason the 
discrimination against the traffic in such goods is reasonable and 
necessary. Mere prejudice or whim will not suffice. The grounds&nbsp; of the 
discrimination must be&nbsp; substantial ones, such as will justify the 
courts in holding the dis-crimination to have been reasonable and 
necessary under all the circumstances of the case."<br><br>Unless an 
amended complaint be filed in the meantime, let judgment be entered ten 
days hereafter sustaining the demurrer and dismissing the complaint with
 costs against the complainant, and twenty days thereafter let the 
record be filed in the archives of original actions in this court. So 
ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J.,</i> and <i>Trent, J.</i> concur.<br><i>Torres</i>
 and <i>Johnson, JJ.</i>, concur in the result.<br><br><br><hr noshade="NOSHADE" size="1" align="CENTER" width="60%"><br><br><center style="font-style: italic;">CONCURRING</center><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">MORELAND, J.,</span><br><br>I may briefly 
say, although the nature of the action is stated at length in the 
foregoing opinion, that it is an action by a shareholder of the Yangco 
Steamship Co. against the company itself and certain officials of the 
Insular Government for an injunction against the company prohibiting it 
from carrying dynamite on its ships and preventing the defendant 
officials from compelling the company to do so under Act No. 98.<br><br>A
 demurrer was filed to the complaint raising the question not only of 
its sufficiency in general, but putting in issue also the right of the 
plaintiff to maintain the action under the allegations of his complaint.<br><br>It
 should be noted that all of the boats of the defendant company, under 
the allegations of the complaint, are boats <i>which carry passengers</i>
 as well as freight, and that the holding of the opinion which I am 
discussing compels <i>passenger</i> ships to carry dynamite and all 
other high explosives when offered for shipment. (See paragraph 3 of the
 complaint.)<br><br>I base my opinion for a dismissal of the complaint 
on the ground that the plaintiff has not alleged in his complaint a 
single one of the grounds, apart from that of being a stockholder, 
necessary for him to allege to maintain a share-holder's action.<br><br>In
 the case of Hawes <i>vs.</i> Oakland (104 U. S., 450), it was said 
relative to the right of a stockholder to bring an action which should 
regularly be brought by the company of which he is a stockholder:<br><blockquote>"We
 understand that doctrine to be that, to enable a stockholder in a 
corporation to sustain in a court of equity in his own name, a suit 
founded on a right of action existing in the corporation itself, and in 
which the corporation itself is the appropriate plaintiff, there must 
exist as the foundation of the suit:<br><br>"Some action or threatened 
action of the managing board of directors or trustees of the 
corporation, which is beyond the authority conferred on them by their 
charter or other source of organization;<br><br>"Or such a fraudulent 
transaction, completed or contemplated by the acting managers, in 
connection with some other party, or among themselves, or with other 
shareholders as will result in serious injury to the corporation, or to 
the interest of the other shareholders; "Or where the board of 
directors, or a majority of them, are acting for their own interest, in a
 manner destructive of the corporation itself, or of the rights of the 
other shareholders;<br><br>"Or where the majority of shareholders 
themselves are oppressively and illegally pursuing a course in the name 
of the corporation, which is in violation of the rights of the other 
shareholders, and which can only be restrained by the aid of a court of 
equity." It was also said: "In this country the cases outside of the 
Federal Courts are not numerous, and while they admit the right of a 
stockholder to sue in cases where the corporation is the proper party to
 bring the suit, they limit this right to cases where <i>the directors 
are guilty of a fraud or a breach of trust, or are proceeding ultra 
vires.</i>"</blockquote>Further on in the same case we find: "Conceding 
appellant's construction of the company's charter to be correct, there 
is nothing which forbids the corporation from dealing with the city in 
the manner it has done.&nbsp; That city conferred on the company valuable 
rights by special ordinance; namely, the use of the streets for the 
laying of its pipes, and the privilege of furnishing water to the whole 
population. It may be the exercise of the highest wisdom, to let the 
city use the water in the manner complained of.&nbsp; The directors are 
better able to act understanding on this subject than a stockholder 
residing in New York. The great body of the stockholders residing in 
Oakland or other places in California may take this view of it, and be 
content to abide by the action of their directors."<br><br>This case is 
conclusive of the right of the plaintiff in the case at bar to maintain 
the action. The complaint is devoid of allegations necessary to sustain a
 complaint by a shareholder.<br><br>The contention of the plaintiff 
based upon the case of <i>Ex parte</i> Young (209 U. S. 123) is not 
sustained by that case. The decision there requires precisely the same 
allegations in the complaint as does the case of Hawes <i>vs.</i> 
Oakland. Not one of those allegations appears in the complaint in the 
case at bar except the allegation that the plaintiff is a stockholder.<br><br>Indeed,
 not only does the complaint lack allegations essential to its 
sufficiency, but it contains allegations which affirmatively show the 
plaintiff is not entitled to maintain the action. I do not stop to 
enumerate them all. I call attention to one only, namely the allegation 
that the company, by its authorized officials, has acted in strict 
conformity with the plaintiff's wishes and has refused to accept 
dynamite for carriage. This allegation shows that the plaintiff has been
 able to obtain his remedy and accomplish his purpose within the 
corporation itself, and it is sufficient, therefore, under the case of 
Hawes <i>vs.</i> Oakland and that of <i>Ex parte</i> Young, to require 
that the demurrer be sustained.<br><br>I am opposed to a decision of 
this case on the merits.<br><br>In the first place, there has been no 
adequate discussion of the merits by the parties. Substantially all of 
the brief of the government was devoted to what may be called the 
technical defects of the complaint, such as I have referred to above. 
Indeed, it is doubtful if any portion of the brief can be said to be 
directly a discussion of the merits.<br><br>In the second place, there 
is no real case pending in this court. It is clear from the complaint 
that the case is a collusive one (not in any improper sense) between the
 plaintiff and defendant company. There is no reason found in the 
complaint why the company should not have brought the action itself, 
every member of the board of directors and every stockholder, according 
to the allegations of the complaint, being in absolute accord with the 
contentions of the plaintiff on the proposition that the company should 
not carry dynamite, and having passed unanimously resolutions to. that 
effect. Moreover, there has been no violation of Act No. 98. No shipper,
 or any other person, has offered dynamite to the defendant company for 
shipment, and, accordingly, the defendant company has not refused to 
accept dynamite for carriage. Nor have the defendant government 
officials begun proceedings, or threatened to bring proceedings, against
 the defendant company in any given case. According to the allegations 
of the complaint, the parties are straw parties and the case a straw 
case.<br><br>In the third place, Act No. 98, under which this proceeding
 is brought and under which, it is, alleged, the defendant public 
officers are threatening to enforce, has been repealed, in so far as it 
affects public service corporations, by Act No. 2307, as amended by Act 
No. 2362. More than that; not only has the law been repealed, but 
proceedings of this character have been placed, in the first instance, 
under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Board of Public Utilities. I am 
unable to see why this court should, under the facts of this case, 
undertake to render a decision on the merits when the Act under which it
 is brought has been repealed and the jurisdiction to render a decision 
on the subject matter involved has been turned over to another body. As I
 have said before, it was unnecessary to a decision of this case to 
touch the merits in any way; and I am opposed to an attempt to lay down a
 doctrine on a subject which is within the exclusive jurisdiction of 
another body created by law expressly for the purpose of removing such 
cases as this from the jurisdiction of the courts.<br><br>I am of the 
opinion that the complaint should be dismissed, but upon grounds apart 
from the merits. If the merits of the case were alone to govern, I 
should be distinctly in favor of the plaintiff's contention so far as it
 relates to the carriage of dynamite on ships carrying passengers; and, 
while I am opposed to a decision on the merits of this case, 
nevertheless, the merits having been brought into the case by the 
opinion of some of my brethren, I desire to refer briefly to the 
jurisprudence of the subject.<br><br>So far as my researches go, the 
proposition that <i>passenger</i> boats must carry dynamite and other 
high explosives is without support in the decisions of any English 
speaking country. I have been unable to find a case anywhere which lays 
down such a doctrine. Indeed, I have been unable to find a case which 
holds that <i>freight</i> boats <i>must</i> carry dynamite or other high
 explosives. Every case that I have been able to find states a contrary 
doctrine; and neither in courts nor in text books is there even a hint 
supporting the contention of my brethren. The opinion cites no 
authorities to support it; and I am constrained to believe that, in an 
opinion so elaborately written, cases to support its thesis would have 
been cited if any such existed.<br><br>On page 372, Vol. 6 of Cyc, will 
be found the following: "Common carriers owe to the public the duty of 
carrying indifferently for all who may employ them, and in the order in 
which the application is made, and without discrimination as to terms. 
They may, however, restrict their business so as to exclude particular 
classes of goods, and they are not bound to receive dangerous articles, 
such as nitroglycerine, dynamite, gunpowder, oil of vitriol, matches, 
etc."<br><br>In the case of California Powder Works <i>vs.</i> Atlantic 
and Pacific U. R. Co. (113 Cal., 329), it was said: "Nor are the 
exemptions contained in the contract of the shipping order void for lack
 of consideration.&nbsp; The defendant was not obliged to receive and 
transport the powder at all. A common carrier is not bound to receive * *
 * dangerous articles, as nitro-glycerine, dynamite, gunpowder, <i>aqua 
fortis</i>, oil of vitriol, matches, etc."<br><br>This, so far as I can 
learn, is the universal doctrine. The California case is reproduced in 
36 L. R. A., 648 and has appended to it a note. It is well known that 
the L. R. A. cites in its notes all of the cases reasonably obtainable 
relative to the subject matter of the case which it annotates. The note 
in L. R. A. with reference to the California case cites a considerable 
number of authorities holding that a carrier of goods is <i>not</i> 
obliged to receive dynamite or other dangerous explosives for carriage. 
It does not cite or refer to a case which holds the contrary.<br><br>The
 reporter of L. R. A., at the beginning of the note with reference to 
the California case, says: "The law upon this question is to be drawn 
from inference or from <i>dicta</i> rather than from decided cases. 
California Powder Works <i>vs.</i> Atlantic &amp; Pacific R. R. Co. 
seems to be the first case to have squarely decided that the carrier is 
not bound to transport dangerous articles, although there has been what 
may be regarded as a general understanding that such is the fact."<br><br>In
 Hutchinson on Carriers (sec. 145), it is said, relative to the 
necessity of a carrier receiving for carriage dynamite or other 
dangerous explosives: "He may, for instance, lawully refuse to receive 
them (the goods) if they are improperly packed or if they are otherwise 
in an unfit condition for carriage. Or he may show that the goods 
offered were of a dangerous character, which might subject him or his 
vehicle, or strangers or his passengers, or his other freight, to the 
risk of injury."<br><br>In a note to the text the author says: "Nor is 
he bound to accept such articles as nitro-glycerine, dynamite, 
gun-powder, oil of vitriol and the like."<br><br>In Elliott on Railroads
 (vol. 4, p. 151), appears the following: "Again, goods may properly be 
refused which are tendered in an unfit condition for transportation, or 
which are dangerous, or which are reasonably believed to be dangerous."<br><br>In
 the case of Boston &amp; Albany Railroad Co. <i>vs.</i> Shanly (107 
Mass., 568), the court said at page 576: "Both the dualin and the 
exploders are thus alleged to be explosive and dangerous articles. Each 
of them was sent without giving notice of its character to the 
plaintiffs, and they were ignorant in respect to it. The rule of law on 
this subject is in conformity with the dictates of common sense and 
justice, and is well established. One who has in his possession a 
dangerous article, which he desires to send to another, may send it by a
 common carrier <i>if he will take it;</i> but it is his duty to give 
him notice of its character, <i>so that he may either refuse to take it</i>,
 or be enabled, if he takes it, to make suitable provision against the 
danger."<br><br>This case cites three English cases as follows, Williams
 <i>vs.</i> East India Co. (3 East, 192) ; Brass <i>vs.</i> Maitland (6 
El. &amp; Bl. 470) ; Farrant <i>vs.</i> Barnes (11 C. B. [N. S.], 553).<br><br>In
 the case of Porcher <i>vs.</i> Northeastern R. Co. (14 Rich. L., 181), 
the court quoted with approval the following from Story on Bailments: 
"If he (the carrier) refuses to take charge of the goods because his 
coach is full or because they are of a nature which will at the time 
expose them to <i>extraordinary danger</i> or to popular rage, or 
because he has no convenient means of carrying such goods with security,
 etc., <i>these will furnish reasonable grounds for his refusal</i>, and
 will, if true, be a sufficient legal defense to a suit for the 
noncarriage of the goods."<br><br>In the case of Fish <i>vs.</i> Chapman
 (2 Ga., 349), the court said: "A common carrier is bound to convey the 
goods of any person offering to pay his hire, unless his carriage be 
already full, or the <i>risk sought to be imposed upon him extraordinary</i>,
 or unless the goods be of a sort which he cannot convey or is not in 
the habit of conveying."<br><br>In the case of Farrant <i>vs.</i> 
Barnes, above cited, the court said that the shipper "knowing the 
dangerous character of the article and omitting to give notice of it to 
the carrier <i>so that he might exercise his discretion as to whether he
 would take it or not</i> was guilty of a clear breach of duty."<br><br>To
 the same effect, generally, are Jackson <i>vs.</i> Rogers (2 Show., 
327); Riley vs. Home (5 Bing., 217) ; Lane <i>vs.</i> Cotton (1 Ld. 
Raym., 646); Edwards <i>vs.</i> Sherratt (1 East, 604) ; Batson <i>vs.</i>
 Donovan (1 Barn. &amp; Aid., 32; 2 Kent, 598); Elsee <i>vs.</i> Gatward
 (5 T. R., 143) ; Dwight <i>vs.</i> Brewster (1 Pick., 50) ; Jencks <i>vs.</i>
 Coleman (2 Sumn., 221) ; Story on Bail., 322, 323; Patton <i>vs.</i> 
Magrath (31 Am. Dec, 552).<br><br>In Story on Bailments (sec. 508), is 
found the following: "If a carrier refuses to take charge of goods 
because his coach is full; or because the goods are <i>of a nature which
 will at the time expose them to extraordinary danger;</i> * * * these 
will furnish reasonable grounds for his refusal; and will, if true, be a
 sufficient legal defense to a suit for the noncarriage of the goods."<br><br>It
 will be noted that all of these cases holding that a common carrier is 
not obliged to receive a dangerous substance, such as dynamite and other
 high explosives, <i>refer exclusively to carriers of merchandise</i> 
and <i>not to carriers of passengers</i>. If the authorities are uniform
 in holding that companies carrying freight are not obliged to accept 
dangerous explosives for carriage, there can be no question as to what 
the rule would be with reference to a carrier of passengers.<br><br>Far 
from requiring passenger boats to accept dynamite and other high 
explosives for carriage, the attitude of the people of the United States
 and of various States is shown by their statutes. The laws of the 
United States and of many of the States prohibit passengers boats and 
passenger trains from carrying dangerous explosives. Sections 232, 233, 
234, 235 and 236 of the Criminal Code of the United States (Compiled 
Stat., 1901), read:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 232. It shall be unlawful to 
transport, carry, or convey, any dynamite, gunpowder, or other 
explosive, between a place in a foreign country and a place within or 
subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, or between a place in 
any State, Territory, or District of the United States, or place 
noncontiguous to but subject to the jurisdiction thereof, and a place in
 any other State, Territory, or District of the United States, or place 
noncontiguous to but subject to the jurisdiction thereof, on any vessel 
or vehicle of any description operated by a common carrier, which vessel
 or vehicle is carrying passengers for hire:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *.<br><br>"SEC.
 233. The Interstate Commerce Commission shall formulate regulations for
 the safe transportation of explosives, which shall be binding upon all 
common carriers engaged in interstate or foreign commerce which 
transport explosives by land. Said commission, of its own motion, or 
upon application made by any interested party, may make changes or 
modifications in such regulations, made desirable by new information or 
altered conditions. Such regulations shall be in accord with the best 
known practicable means for securing safety in transit, covering the 
packing, marking, loading, handling while in transit, and the 
precautions necessary to determine whether the material when offered is 
in proper condition to transport.<br><br>"Such regulations, as well as 
all changes or modifications thereof, shall take effect ninety days 
after their formulation and publication by said commission and shall be 
in effect until reversed, set aside, or modified.<br><br>"SEC. 234. It 
shall be unlawful to transport, carry, or convey, liquid nitroglycerin, 
fulminate in bulk in dry condition, or other like explosive, between a 
place in a foreign country and a place within or subject to the 
jurisdiction of the United States, or between a place in one State, 
Territory, or District of the United States, or place noncontiguous to 
but subject to the jurisdiction thereof, and a place in any other State,
 Territory, or District of the United States, or place noncontiguous to 
but subject to the jurisdiction thereof, on any vessel or vehicle of any
 description operated by a common carrier in the transportation of 
passengers or articles of commerce by land or water.<br><br>"SEC. 235. 
Every package containing explosives or other dangerous articles when 
presented to a common carrier for shipment shall have plainly marked on 
the outside thereof the contents thereof; and it shall be unlawful for 
any person to deliver, or cause to be delivered, to any common carrier 
engaged in interstate or foreign commerce by land or water, for 
interstate or foreign transportation, or to carry upon any vessel or 
vehicle engaged in interstate or foreign transportation, any explosive, 
or other dangerous article, under any false or deceptive marking, 
description, invoice, shipping order, or other declaration, or without 
informing the agent of such carrier of the true character thereof, at or
 before the time such delivery or carriage is made. Whoever shall 
knowingly violate, or cause to be violated, any provision of this 
section, or of the three sections last preceding, or any regulation made
 by the Interstate Commerce Commission in pursuance thereof, shall be 
fined not more than two thousand dollars, or imprisoned not more than 
eighteen months, or both.<br><br>"SEC. 236. When the death or bodily 
injury of any person is caused by the explosion of any article named in 
the four sections last preceding, while the same is being placed upon 
any vessel or vehicle to be transported in violation thereof, or while 
the same is being so transported, or while the same is being removed 
from such vessel or vehicle, the person knowingly placing, or aiding or 
permitting the placing, of such articles upon any such vessel or 
vehicle, to be so transported, shall be imprisoned not more than ten 
years."</blockquote>Human ingenuity has been continuously exercised for 
ages to make sea travel safe, that men might sail the seas with as 
little risk as possible; that they might rely upon the quality of the 
ship and the character and experience of the sailors who manned her; 
that they might feel that the dangers of the deep had been reduced to 
the minimum. Not only this; the abilities of legislators have been taxed
 to the same end; to frame laws that would ensure seaworthy ships, safe 
appliances, and reliable officers and crews; to curb the avarice of 
those who would subordinate the safety of passengers to a desire for 
freight; and to so regulate travel by sea that all might safely confide 
their property and their lives to the ships sailing under the flag of 
their country. Can a decision which requires passenger ships to carry 
dynamite and all high explosives be made to harmonize with this purpose?
 What is there in the Philippine Islands to justify the requirement that
 passenger ships carry dynamite, while in the United States the carrying
 of dynamite by passenger ships is a crime? Why should passengers in the
 Philippine Islands be subjected to conditions which are abhorrent in 
the United States? Why compel shipowners in the Philippine Islands to 
perform acts which, if done in the United States, would send them to the
 penitentiary?<br><br>I do not believe that we should require passengers
 to travel on ships carrying, perhaps, many tons of nitroglycerine, 
dynamite or gunpowder in their holds; nor do I believe that any public 
official should do anything calculated to add to the calamity of fire, 
collision, or shipwreck the horrors of explosion.<br><br><br><hr noshade="NOSHADE" size="1" align="CENTER" width="60%"><br><br><center style="font-style: italic;">DISSENTING</center><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">ARAULLO, J.,</span><br><br>I do not agree 
with the decision of the majority of this court in this case, first, 
because one of the grounds of the demurrer to the complaintâthe first 
oneâis that of lack of legal capacity to sue on the part of the 
plaintiff and nothing is said in the decision regarding this very 
important point. It is one which ought to have received special 
attention, even before the other alleged in the demurrer that the 
complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of 
action, and the only one that received any consideration in the decision
 in question. Second, because notwithstanding that in the decision no 
consideration was paid to the alleged lack of legal capacity on the part
 of the plaintiff, he is, by reason of the demurrer being sustained, 
authorized to present an amended complaint within ten been given without
 an express finding that such capacity on the part of said plaintiff was
 not lacking.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Demurrer

 before us upon a demurrer interposed by the respondent officials of the
 Philippine Government to an amended complaint filed after publication 
of our decision sustaining the demurrer to the original complaint.<br><br>In
 our former opinion, entered November 5, 1914, we sustained the demurrer
 on the ground that the original complaint did not set forth facts 
sufficient to constitute a cause of action. In that decision we held 
that the statute (Act No, 98) the validity of which was attacked by 
counsel for plaintiff was, when rightly construed, a valid and 
constitutional enactment, and ruled:<br><blockquote>"That whatever may 
have been the rule at the common law, common carriers in this 
jurisdiction cannot lawfully decline to accept a particular class of 
goods for carriage, to the prejudice of the traffic in those goods, 
unless it appears that for some sufficient reason the discrimination 
against the traffic in such goods is reasonable and necessary. Mere 
prejudice or whim will not suffice. The grounds of the discrimination 
must be substantial ones, such as will justify the courts in holding the
 discrimination to have been reasonable and necessary under all the 
circumstances of the case.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></div><br>"The traffic in dynamite, gunpowder and 
other explosives is vitally essential to the material and general 
welfare of the people of these Islands. If dynamite, gunpowder and other
 explosives are to continue in general use throughout the Philippines, 
they must be transported by water from port to port in the various 
islands which make' up the Archipelago. We are satisfied therefore that 
the refusal by a particular vessel, engaged as a common carrier of 
merchandise in the coastwise trade of the Philippine Islands, to accept 
any or all of these explosives for carriage would constitute a violation
 of the prohibitions against discriminations penalized under the 
statute, unless it can be shown by affirmative evidence that there is so
 real and substantial a danger of disaster necessarily involved in the 
carriage of any or all of these articles of merchandise as to render 
such refusal a due or a necessary or a reasonable exercise of prudence 
and discretion on the part of the ship owner."</blockquote>Resting our 
judgment on these rulings we held that the allegations of the complaint,
 which in substance alleged merely that the respondent officials were 
coercing the respondent steamship company to carry explosives upon some 
of their vessels, under authority of, and in reliance upon the 
provisions of the Act, did not set forth facts constituting a cause of 
action; or in other words, that the allegations of the complaint even if
 true, would not sustain a finding that the respondent officials were 
acting "without or in excess of their jurisdiction" and lawful authority
 in the premises.<br><br>The amended complaint filed on November 14, 
1914, is substantially identical with the original complaint, except 
that it charges the respondent officials, <i>as of the date of the 
amended complaint</i>, with the unlawful exercise of authority or intent
 to exercise unlawful authority which should be restrained, and 
substitutes the names of the officers now holding the offices of 
Collector of Customs, Attorney-General and prosecuting attorney for 
those of the officials holding those offices at the date of the filing 
of the original complaint ; and except further that it adds the 
following allegations:<br><blockquote>"That each and every one of the 
vessels of the defendant company is dedicated and devoted to the 
carriage of passengers between various ports in the Philippine Islands, 
and each of said vessels, on all of said voyages between the said ports,
 usually and ordinarily does carry a large number of such passengers.<br><br>"That
 dynamite, powder, and other explosives are dangerous commodities that 
cannot be handled and transported in the manner and form in which 
ordinary commodities are handled and transported. That no degree of 
care, preparation and special arrangement in the handling and 
transportation of dynamite, powder and other explosives will wholly 
eliminate the risk and danger of grave peril and loss therefrom, and 
that the highest possible degree of care, preparation and special 
arrangement in the handling and transportation of said commodities is 
only capable of reducing the degree of said danger and peril. That each 
and every one of the vessels of the defendant company is wholly without 
special means for the handling, carriage, or transportation of dynamite,
 powder and other explosives and such special means therefor which would
 appreciably and materially reduce the danger and peril therefrom cannot
 be installed in said vessels without a cost and expense unto said 
company that is unreasonable and prohibitive."</blockquote>As we read 
them, the allegations of the original complaint were intended to raise 
and did in fact raise, upon demurrer, a single question which, if ruled 
upon favorably to the contention of plaintiff, would, doubtless, have 
put an end to this litigation and to the dispute between the plaintiff 
stockholder of the steamship company and the officials of the Philippine
 Government out of which it has arisen.<br><br>In their brief, counsel 
for plaintiff, in discussing their right to maintain an action for a 
writ of prohibition, relied upon the authority of <i>Ex parte</i> Young 
(209 U. S. [123] 163, 165), and asserted that: <br><blockquote>"Upon the
 authority, therefore, of <i>Ex parte</i> Young, <i>supra</i>, the 
merits of the question pending between petitioner and respondents in 
this action is duly presented to this court by the complaint of 
petitioner and general demurrer of respondents thereto. That question, 
in plain terms, is as follows:<br><br>"Is the respondent Yangco 
Steamship Company legally required to accept for carriage and carry 'any
 person or Property offering for carriage?'<br><br>"The petitioner 
contends that the respondent company is a common carrier of only such 
articles of freight as they profess to carry and hold themselves out as 
carrying;" and in discussing the legal capacity of plaintiff to maintain
 this action, counsel in their printed brief asserted that "here we have
 no address to the court to determine whether a minority or a majority 
shall prevail in the corporate affairs; here we ask plainly and 
unmistakably who shall fix the limits of the corporate businessâthe 
shareholders and directors of the corporation, or certain officials of 
the government armed with an unconstitutional statute?" <br>
</blockquote>Counsel for plaintiff contended that under the guaranties 
of the Philippine Bill of Rights a common carrier in the Philippine 
Islands may arbitrarily decline to accept for carriage any shipment of 
merchandise of a class which it expressly or impliedly declines to 
accept from all shippers alike; that "the duty of a common carrier to 
carry for all who offer arises from the public profession he has made, 
and is limited by it;" that under this doctrine the respondent steamship
 company might lawfully decline to accept for carriage "dynamite, powder
 or other explosives," without regard to any question as to the 
conditions under which such explosives are offered for carriage, or as 
to the suitableness of its vessels for the transportation of such 
explosives, or as to the possibility that the refusal to accept such 
articles of commerce in a particular case might have the effect of 
subjecting any person, locality or the traffic in such explosives to an 
undue, unreasonable or unnecessary prejudice or discrimination: and in 
line with these contentions counsel boldly asserted that Act No. 98 of 
the Philippine Commission is invalid and unconstitutional in so far as 
it announces a contrary doctrine or lays down a different rule. The 
pleader who drew up the original complaint appears to have studiously 
avoided the inclusion in that complaint of any allegation which might 
raise any other question. In doing so he was strictly within his rights,
 and having in mind the object sought to be attained, the original 
complaint is a model of skillful pleading, well calculated to secure the
 end in view, that is to say, a judgment on the precise legal issue 
which the pleader desired to raise as to the construction and validity 
of the statute, which would put an end to the controversy, if that issue
 were decided in his favor.<br><br>Had the contentions of plaintiff as 
to the unconstitutionality of the statute been well founded, a writ of 
prohibition from this court would have furnished an effective and 
appropriate remedy for the alleged wrong. The issue presented by the 
pleadings on the original complaint, involving a question as to the 
validity of a statute and affecting, as it did, the shipping and public 
interests of the whole Islands, and submitting no complicated question 
or series of questions of fact, was of such a nature that this court 
could not properly deny the right of the plaintiff to invoke its 
jurisdiction in original proceedings. We deemed it our duty therefore to
 resolve the real issue raised by the demurrer, and since we were of 
opinion that the contentions of counsel for the plaintiff were not well 
founded, and since a ruling to that effect necessarily resulted in an 
order sustaining the demurrer, we did not deem it necessary or 
profitable to consider questions of practice or procedure which it might
 have been necessary to decide under a contrary ruling as to the 
principal question raised by the pleadings; nor did we stop to consider 
whether the "subject matter involved" in the controversy might properly 
be submitted to the Board of Public Utility Commissioners, because upon 
the authority of <i>Ex parte</i> Young (<i>supra</i>) we were satisfied 
as to the jurisdiction and competency of this court to deal with the 
real issues raised by the pleadings on the original complaint, and 
because, furthermore, the Act of the Philippine Legislature creating the
 Board of Public Utility Commissioners could not deprive this court of 
jurisdiction already invoked in prohibition proceedings instituted for 
the purpose of restraining the respondent officials of the Government 
from the alleged unlawful exercise of authority under color of an 
invalid statute and without jurisdiction in the premises.<br><br>The 
amended complaint, however, presents for adjudication in original 
prohibition proceedings in this court questions of a wholly different 
character from those submitted in the original complaint.<br><br>In so 
far as it reiterates the allegations of the former complaint to the 
effect that the respondent officials are unlawfully coercing the 
steamship company by virtue and under color of the provisions of an 
invalid or unconstitutional statute, it is manifest, of course, that the
 amended complaint is no less subject to criticism than was the original
 complaint. If, therefore, the action can be maintained upon the amended
 complaint it must be maintained upon its allegations that those 
officials are coercing the company to carry explosives on vessels which,
 as a matter of fact, are not suitably equipped for that purpose, and 
which from the nature of the business in which they are engaged should 
not be required to carry expldsives.<br><br>It will readily be seen, 
under our former opinion, that these allegations raise no question as to
 the validity or constitutionality of any statute; that the real 
question which plaintiff seeks to submit to this court in original 
prohibition proceedings is whether the respondent officials of the 
Government are correctly exercising the discretion and authority with 
which they have been clothed; and that his contention in the amended 
complaint is not, as it was in the original complaint, that these 
officials are acting without authority and in reliance upon an invalid 
and unconstitutional statute, but rather that they are exercising their 
authority improvidently, unwisely or mistakenly.<br><br>Under the 
provisions of sections 226 and 516 of the Code of Civil Procedure 
jurisdiction in prohibition proceedings is conferred upon the courts 
when the complaint alleges "the proceedings of any inferior tribunal, 
corporation, board, or person, whether exercising functions judicial or 
ministerial, were without or in excess of the jurisdiction of such 
tribunal, corporation, board or person." It is manifest therefore that 
the allegations of the amended complaint, even if true, will not sustain
 the issuance of a writ of prohibition without further amendment unless 
they be construed to be in effect a charge that the respondent officials
 are abusing the discretion conferred upon them in the exercise of their
 authority in such manner that the acts complained of should be held to 
be without or in excess of their jurisdiction.<br><br>It may well be 
doubted whether the doctrine of the case <i>Ex parte</i> Young (<i>supra</i>),
 relied upon by the plaintiff in his argument in support of the original
 complaint, can properly be invoked in support of a right of action 
predicated upon such premises; so also, since the acts complained of in 
the amended complaint are alleged to have been done at a date subsequent
 to the enactment of the statutes creating the Board of Public Utility 
Commissioners, it may well be doubted whether the courts should 
entertain prohibition proceedings seeking to restrain alleged abuses of 
discretion on the part of officers and officials of the Government, and 
of public service corporations with regard to the rules under which such
 corporations are operated, until and unless redress for the alleged 
wrong has been sought at the hands of the Board.<br><br>We do not deem 
it expedient or necessary, however, to consider or decide any of these 
questions at this time, because we are of opinion that we should not 
permit our original jurisdiction to be set in motion upon the 
allegations of the amended complaint.<br><br>It is true that this court 
is clothed with original jurisdiction in prohibition proceedings (sec. 
516, Act No. 190). But this jurisdiction is concurrent with the original
 jurisdiction of the various Courts of First Instance throughout the 
Islands, except in cases where the writ runs to restrain those courts 
themselves, when of course it is exclusive; and we are satisfied that it
 could not have been the intention of the legislator to require this 
court to assume original jurisdiction in all cases wherein the plaintiff
 elects to invoke it. Such a practice might result in overwhelming this 
court with the duty of entertaining and deciding original proceedings 
which from their nature could much better be adjudicated in the trial 
courts; and in unnecessarily diverting the time and attention of the 
court from its important appellate functions to the settlement of 
controversies of no especial interest to the public at large, in the 
course of which it might become necessary to take testimony and to make 
findings touching complicated and hotly contested issues of fact.<br><br>We
 are of opinion and so hold that unless special reasons appear therefor,
 this court should decline to permit its original jurisdiction to be 
invoked in prohibition proceedings, and this especially when the 
adjudication of the issues raised involves the taking of evidence and 
the making of findings touching controverted facts, which, as a rule, 
can be done so much better in the first instance by a trial court than 
an appellate court organized as is ours.<br><br>Spelling on Injunctions 
and Other Extraordinary Remedies (vol. 2, p. 1493), in discussing the 
cases in which the appellate courts in the United States permit their 
original jurisdiction to be invoked where that jurisdiction is 
concurrent with that of some inferior court, says:<br><blockquote>"Of 
the plan of concurrent jurisdiction West Virginia may be taken as an 
illustration. The Supreme Court of Appeals of that State has concurrent 
original jurisdiction with the circuit courts in cases of prohibition, 
but by a rule adopted by the former court it will not take such original
 jurisdiction unless special reasons appear therefor."</blockquote>We 
deemed it proper to assume jurisdiction to adjudicate and decide the 
issues raised by the rulings on the original complaint, involving as 
they did a question as to the validity of a public statute of vital 
interest to shippers and ship owners generally as also to the public at 
large, and presenting for determination no difficult or complicated 
questions of fact: but we are satisfied that we should decline to take 
jurisdiction of the matters relied upon in the amended complaint in 
support of plaintiff's prayer for the writ.<br><br>The question of the 
construction and validity of the statute having been disposed of in our 
ruling on the demurrer to the original complaint, it must be apparent 
that if the allegations of the amended complaint are sufficient to 
maintain the plaintiff's action for a writ of prohibition, a question as
 to which we expressly reserve our opinion, the action should be brought
 in one of the Courts of First Instance.<br><br>Twenty days hereafter 
let the complaint be dismissed at the costs of the plaintiff, unless in 
the meantime it is amended so as to disclose a right upon the part of 
the plaintiff to invoke the original jurisdiction of this court without 
first proceeding in one of the Courts of First Instance.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano,
