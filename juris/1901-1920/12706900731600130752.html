				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"> On December 1, 1908, the plaintiffs' counsel filed a written complaint with the Court of First Instance of Leyte alleging as grounds of action: That the plaintiff party was a mercantile partnership&nbsp; company established in these Islands, in accordance with the&nbsp; laws in force, with residence in&nbsp; the city of Manila and&nbsp; several branch offices&nbsp; in different&nbsp; parts of the Archipelago, its principal&nbsp; business&nbsp; being the purchase and sale of hemp, rice, copra and other domestic and foreign products; that it was the owner&nbsp; of a pier for&nbsp; the service of steamers at the port of Tacloban, Leyte,&nbsp; which pier was acquired from the defunct commercial house&nbsp; of Pablo&nbsp; Ortiga, to whose business,&nbsp; real and&nbsp; personal properties, rights&nbsp; and actions the&nbsp; plaintiffs succeeded&nbsp; and&nbsp; of which they took charge&nbsp; by virtue of an agreement between the heirs of the deceased Ortiga who were then the members of the plaintiff company; that&nbsp; the defendant Francisco Enage, the sheriff of the Province&nbsp; of Leyte, on or about the 8th of November, 1908,&nbsp; through his deputy, Cornelio Manalo,&nbsp; and&nbsp; in&nbsp; compliance&nbsp; with&nbsp; an order of execution issued&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of 'First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Manila,&nbsp;&nbsp; at the&nbsp; request&nbsp; of the&nbsp; defendant,&nbsp; Yap&nbsp; Tico,&nbsp; against&nbsp; the property of Juana&nbsp; Mercado, Felix&nbsp; Villa and&nbsp; the minors Mercedes, Julian,&nbsp; Felisa&nbsp; and&nbsp; Joaquina&nbsp; Villa, attached the undivided half&nbsp; of the said pier, for the reason that one-half&nbsp; of&nbsp; the same belonged to the judgment debtors aforementioned; and&nbsp; notwithstanding&nbsp; that the proper&nbsp; affidavit was presented to the sheriff by the&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; firm in order&nbsp; that he might desist from attaching the said half of the&nbsp; pier of the firm's exclusive ownership, and, though at the beginning the sheriff acceded to its request, yet,&nbsp;&nbsp; a bond&nbsp; having been given by&nbsp; Yap Tico to indemnify the sheriff against any claim which&nbsp; might arise&nbsp; by reason of the attachment, this&nbsp; official, on&nbsp; November 23, 1908, proceeded with the attachment of the said undivided half of the pier and endeavored to sell it, according to the notices given, for the purpose of satisfying the judgment rendered by the Court of First&nbsp; Instance of Manila,&nbsp; in favor of Yap Tico and against the&nbsp; said Juana Mercado, Felix Villa and the minors, Mercedes, Julian,&nbsp; Felisa and&nbsp; Joaquina&nbsp; Villa; that these&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; debtors, none of&nbsp; them,&nbsp; at any time held and owned one-half of&nbsp; the&nbsp; said pier, nor were they then,&nbsp; at the time of the&nbsp; presentation of the complaint, 'the possessors&nbsp; and owners thereof,&nbsp; since the said half of the pier belonged to the&nbsp; plaintiff company,&nbsp; who acquired it from&nbsp; the&nbsp; intestate&nbsp; estate of the&nbsp; deceased Ildefonso Villa Lim Yamco by virtue of&nbsp; a&nbsp; conveyance or sale&nbsp; made on August&nbsp; 17, 1907, through the administratrix of the said estate to the&nbsp; aforementioned firm of Pablo&nbsp; Ortiga,&nbsp; with the authorization of the court, in payment of a part of a certain&nbsp; debt of the estate before&nbsp; referred to; that all the facts&nbsp; alleged by the plaintiff company were known to the defendants, and to&nbsp; each one of them, prior to and at the time&nbsp; of the attachment&nbsp; of the said one-half&nbsp; of&nbsp; the pier, and that, notwithstanding, the&nbsp; defendants, maliciously and with&nbsp; the deliberate intention&nbsp; of&nbsp; prejudicing&nbsp; and injuring the plaintiffs'&nbsp; interests by causing them to incur unnecessary expenses, brought&nbsp; about the attachment of the said property, and on account&nbsp; of&nbsp; such procedure&nbsp; on&nbsp; the part of the defendants and in&nbsp; order that the&nbsp; plaintiffs might protect their interests, the latter had to&nbsp; employ an attorney whose professional fees, amounting to P600, were contracted&nbsp; for and paid,&nbsp; in addition to other expenses; and that the sheriff, unless prevented&nbsp; by the court, would proceed to&nbsp; sell the half of&nbsp; the said pier to the&nbsp; detriment of the plaintiffs' rights,&nbsp; against which act they&nbsp; had not the remedy of appeal, nor any other expeditious remedy; wherefore they prayed the&nbsp; court to issue&nbsp; a writ of injunction against the sheriff, in&nbsp; order&nbsp; that; during&nbsp; the pendency of this claim, he should&nbsp; refrain from&nbsp; selling the said one-half of the pier and desist from executing any act tending to the same&nbsp; purpose.&nbsp; The plaintiffs&nbsp; further prayed that judgment be&nbsp; rendered whereby it be declared that the pier in question is the exclusive property of the plaintiff company and that the attachment levied on the same is unjust and&nbsp; malicious.&nbsp;&nbsp; The plaintiffs also asked that the defendants be sentenced to pay to&nbsp; them P600 on account of the expenses incurred, and the costs of the trial.<br><br>The demurrer to&nbsp; the&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; having been overruled, the defendants in their answer, through their counsel, denied each and all of the allegations contained in each and every paragraph of the said complaint&nbsp; and asked that they be absolved therefrom,&nbsp; with the costs&nbsp; against the plaintiff.<br><br>The defendant, F. M. Yap&nbsp; Tico, appearing separately by counsel, alleged in his amended answer of July 13, 1909, that he&nbsp; denied each&nbsp; and&nbsp; every allegation contained in each and&nbsp; every one of the paragraphs&nbsp; of the complaint; that, as special defenses,&nbsp; he set forth:&nbsp; That the plaintiff party lacked the personality&nbsp; requisite for the prosecution of&nbsp; the action&nbsp; instituted; that one-half of the said&nbsp; pier belonged exclusively to the intestate estate&nbsp; of&nbsp; Ildefonso Villa Lim Yamco,&nbsp; the judicially declared&nbsp; heirs of whom were Juana Mercado,&nbsp; Felix&nbsp; Villa,&nbsp; and the&nbsp; minors, Mercedes,&nbsp; Julian, Felisa&nbsp; and Joaquina Villa,&nbsp; residing in&nbsp; Tanauan,&nbsp; Leyte; that the attachment levied upon the one-half of&nbsp; the said pier, was made at the instance of Juana Mercado&nbsp; as&nbsp; the administratrix&nbsp; of the aforementioned&nbsp; estate and with&nbsp; the approval of the&nbsp; heirs thereof, in order to satisfy the claim held by the defendant Yap Tico against the said estate of Lim Yamco;&nbsp; that, in the highly improbable case that Yap Tico should not&nbsp; be considered as a creditor of the intestate Lim Yamco,&nbsp; but&nbsp; simply of&nbsp; the latter's heirs, he would make no claim to acquire over the said half of the disputed pier any&nbsp; other&nbsp; right,&nbsp; interest&nbsp; and share except such as pertain or may pertain to the&nbsp; said Juana Mercado and other of her coheirs;&nbsp; that the sale or transfer,&nbsp; in payment of the said&nbsp; half of the pier,&nbsp; which the plaintiff alleged had been&nbsp; made in the latter's favor by&nbsp; the&nbsp; administratrix of the intestate estate, Juana Mercado, was effected without the knowledge and authorization of a competent court and, therefore, was null and&nbsp; void, for the said sale or transfer prejudiced and&nbsp; was still prejudicing the interests of the estate of the deceased&nbsp; Lim&nbsp; Yamco, the&nbsp; creditors of the estate and also&nbsp; the heirs of the said deceased,&nbsp; as well as the rights of the creditors&nbsp; of such heirs,&nbsp; by preventing them from realizing upon their claims and with&nbsp; the rights, interest&nbsp; and share which pertained or&nbsp; might&nbsp; pertain to each one and all of the said&nbsp; heirs; and that the defendant had carried on&nbsp; with the plaintiffs&nbsp; friendly negotiations in order to convince them&nbsp; of the reality&nbsp; of his&nbsp; right in the one-half of the&nbsp; said&nbsp; pier, but&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiffs did not respond to such act of loyalty and unjustly&nbsp; compelled him to maintain&nbsp; the present suit which, if it&nbsp; had&nbsp; not&nbsp; been for the plaintiffs' procedure, he never would have contemplated; wherefore the defendant asked that the complaint be dismissed with the costs against the plaintiff&nbsp; company.<br><br>The case came to trial, oral evidence&nbsp; was introduced&nbsp; by both&nbsp; parties,&nbsp; the documents&nbsp; exhibited&nbsp; being attached&nbsp; to the record, and the court, on&nbsp; April&nbsp; 25, 1910, rendered judgment whereby it found that the&nbsp; one-half of the pier in question belonged to the plaintiff company and&nbsp; not to the judgment debtors, Juana Mercado,&nbsp; Felix, Mercedes, Julian, Joaquina, and Felisa Villa, and that&nbsp; the attachment levied upon&nbsp; the said one-half of the&nbsp; pier was unjust and malicious, sentenced the defendants to&nbsp; pay to the plaintiffs the sum of P600 for the damages caused&nbsp; to the latter&nbsp; by reason of the said attachment, and ordered the sheriff and the other defendant, Yap Tico,&nbsp; to&nbsp; refrain&nbsp; from performing any acts whatsoever tending to the prosecution of the said attachment, with the&nbsp; costs&nbsp; against&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants.&nbsp; The latter's counsel,&nbsp; having been notified of this judgment, took exception thereto and by a written&nbsp; motion asked for a new trial,&nbsp; on the ground&nbsp; that&nbsp; such judgment was&nbsp; openly and manifestly contrary to the weight of the evidence and to law.&nbsp;&nbsp; This motion was overruled and exception&nbsp; was taken by the defendants' counsel,&nbsp; who&nbsp; duly&nbsp; filed the required bill&nbsp; of exceptions, which&nbsp; was&nbsp; approved,&nbsp; certified&nbsp; to&nbsp; and forwarded to the&nbsp; clerk of this court.<br><br>The writ of execution issued by the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of&nbsp; Manila, at&nbsp; the petition of the&nbsp; Chinaman Yap Tico, was&nbsp; intended to obtain the&nbsp; collection of a debt contracted in favor&nbsp; of the latter&nbsp; by Juana&nbsp; Mercado,&nbsp; Felix, Mercedes,&nbsp; Julian, Felisa and Joaquina Villa,&nbsp; the&nbsp; widow and&nbsp; heirs of the deceased Ildefonso Villa Lim Yamco,&nbsp; and for this&nbsp; purpose the undivided one-half of the pier, used for the service&nbsp; of steamers&nbsp; and constructed&nbsp; at the wharf of the port of Tacloban, was attached by the sheriff of the Province of Leyte, as belonging to the said&nbsp; debtors.<br><br>The pier&nbsp; aforementioned&nbsp; originally&nbsp; belonged, half&nbsp; to Pablo&nbsp; Ortiga and half to Ildefonso Villa, and&nbsp; when&nbsp; the latter died, on July 16, 1899, the one-half&nbsp; of the said pier was&nbsp; transferred or&nbsp; ceded in payment of&nbsp; a part of what was&nbsp; found to be owing by his&nbsp; intestate estate, to his co-owner, Ortiga, to whose rights the plaintiffs, Ortiga&nbsp; Brothers and&nbsp; Company, in&nbsp; turn&nbsp; succeeded,&nbsp; as&nbsp; shown by&nbsp; the record of proceedings,&nbsp; attached as Exhibit 2, had&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance of&nbsp; Leyte&nbsp; in&nbsp; connection with&nbsp; the settlement&nbsp; of the intestate estate of the aforesaid Ildefonso Villa Lim Yamco.&nbsp; So&nbsp; that the credit for the payment of which&nbsp; an&nbsp; attachment was levied upon the&nbsp; said half&nbsp; of the pier, is not&nbsp; one against the intestate&nbsp; succession of&nbsp; the deceased,&nbsp; Yamco,&nbsp; but&nbsp; against his&nbsp; widow&nbsp; and heirs; and it&nbsp; is not&nbsp; shown in the aforesaid record&nbsp; of proceedings that&nbsp; the judgment creditor,&nbsp; Yap&nbsp; Tico, was a creditor&nbsp; of the said&nbsp; intestate, as no credit whatever&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; name&nbsp; of the said&nbsp; Yap Tico appears among those which were recognized and&nbsp; admitted&nbsp; as legitimate by&nbsp; the committee&nbsp; of appraisal appointed by that court.<br><br>A person who, having a claim against&nbsp; a&nbsp; deceased person which&nbsp; should be&nbsp; considered by the&nbsp; committee does not, after publication of&nbsp; the required notice, exhibit his&nbsp; claim to&nbsp; the committee as provided by law, shall be barred from recovering such&nbsp; demand or from pleading&nbsp; the same as an&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; offset to any action,&nbsp; under the&nbsp; provisions of section&nbsp; 695 of the Code of Civil Procedure, excepting: the case referred to in&nbsp; section 701 of&nbsp; the&nbsp; same; with&nbsp; still less reason&nbsp; can one&nbsp; who is not&nbsp; a creditor of the said deceased intervene in the proceedings relative to&nbsp; the latter's intestate&nbsp; estate and to the settlement of&nbsp; his succession (article 1034 of the&nbsp; Civil&nbsp; Code), because&nbsp; such creditor&nbsp; has no&nbsp; right or interest&nbsp; that call for the protection&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; law and&nbsp; the courts, except in any remainder&nbsp; which may be found&nbsp; due the heir.<br><br>It is true that&nbsp; Yap Tico, as the creditor of the widow&nbsp; and heirs of the deceased Ildefonso,&nbsp; is entitled to collect what is due&nbsp; him out of&nbsp; the property left by the latter and which was inherited by such widow and heirs, but it is no&nbsp; less true that only after&nbsp; all the debts of the said estate have been&nbsp; paid can it be&nbsp; known&nbsp; what net remainder&nbsp; will be left for division&nbsp; among the heirs,&nbsp; because the debts of&nbsp; the deceased must be paid before his heirs can.inherit.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Arts. 659&nbsp; et seq.,&nbsp; 1026, 1027, and 1032 of&nbsp; the Civil Code,&nbsp; and sees. 734 et seq., Code of&nbsp; Civil&nbsp; Procedure.)<br><br>An execution can not legally be&nbsp; levied&nbsp; upon the property of an&nbsp; intestate succession&nbsp; to pay the&nbsp; debts&nbsp; of the&nbsp; widow and&nbsp; heirs&nbsp; of the deceased, until the&nbsp; credits&nbsp; held&nbsp; against the latter&nbsp; at the time of&nbsp; his death shall have been paid, and&nbsp; only after the debts of the estate have been paid&nbsp; can the remaining property that pertains to the said&nbsp; debtor heirs be attached.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Art.&nbsp; 1034, aforecited, Civil&nbsp; Code.)<br><br>From&nbsp; the record&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; proceedings beforementioned it is&nbsp; not found that the attached one-half of the pier forms a&nbsp; part of the property remaining after payment of&nbsp; the debts against the said&nbsp; intestate estate, nor that it continues to belong to&nbsp; the&nbsp; assets of the estate left by&nbsp; the deceased Ildefonso Villa Lim Yamco;&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; contrary, it&nbsp; appears from the said proceedings that&nbsp; the&nbsp; said one-half of&nbsp; the pier&nbsp; was transferred&nbsp; to Pablo Ortiga, the owner of&nbsp; the other half and&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiffs' predecessor in interest, in partial payment&nbsp; of a&nbsp; larger sum&nbsp; which the deceased Ildefonso Villa owed&nbsp; Ortiga, as specified by the debtor's widow, the&nbsp; administratrix of his intestate estate, on&nbsp; August&nbsp; 17, 1907,&nbsp; as&nbsp; may&nbsp; be seen by the writ issued on&nbsp; May&nbsp; 14 by order&nbsp; of the Hon. Judge W. F. Norris, p. 104&nbsp; of the trial record, which&nbsp; does not&nbsp; show&nbsp; that&nbsp; the said transfer in partial payment was&nbsp; impugned by any of&nbsp; the interested parties or by&nbsp; other&nbsp; creditors of the&nbsp; estate; the debt of 1,885&nbsp; pesos 43&nbsp; centavos and&nbsp; 6 octavos due the Ortiga firm, the&nbsp; plaintiffs' predecessor in interest,&nbsp; and secured&nbsp; by the said one-half of the pier, was recognized and admitted, with two other debts, by the committee on&nbsp; claims in its report of&nbsp; March&nbsp; 30,&nbsp; 1907, page 70 of the record,&nbsp; which report was approved by the said judge in his order of April 30, 1907,&nbsp; page 76&nbsp; of the record.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is to be noted that the order&nbsp; of August 30,&nbsp; 1906, a copy&nbsp; of which&nbsp; was exhibited under&nbsp; letter D, and which, according to the certification of the annotations of the docket, Exhibit 3, was annulled by another order&nbsp; of November 26 of the&nbsp; same year,&nbsp; relates to the sum of&nbsp; P8,081.77, another debt&nbsp; of the intestate to the Ortiga firm, admitted by the committee of appraisal in its&nbsp; previous report of June 28, 1906,&nbsp; page 36 of the trial record.<br><br>The attachment levied upon the one-half of the said pier, at the instance of&nbsp; the defendant, Yap Tico,&nbsp; is, then, evidently and unquestionably improper, not only because the said defendant is not a&nbsp; creditor of the intestate estate of the deceased Ildefonso Villa&nbsp; Lim Yamco, but also because the said&nbsp; one-half of the&nbsp; pier became&nbsp; the&nbsp; property&nbsp; of the plaintiffs, as a partial&nbsp; payment of a certain debt&nbsp; of the deceased.&nbsp;&nbsp; The plaintiffs&nbsp; must be considered as the legitimate&nbsp; owners of the&nbsp; said one-half of the&nbsp; pier, so&nbsp; long as the cession or transfer of the same is&nbsp; not annulled by an express judicial decree, through the&nbsp; prosecution&nbsp; of the proper action brought on the ground of some vice or defect tending to nullify the same.<br><br>With respect to the professional fees&nbsp; which the plaintiffs stated&nbsp; they had to&nbsp; pay their attorney for the prosecution of the&nbsp; action in order to protect their rights, which fees amounted to P600, it must be borne in mind that attorneys' fees are&nbsp; not included&nbsp; within the expenses and costs of any trial or proceedings, specified as fees to be paid by the parties&nbsp; to the&nbsp; suit, pursuant to the&nbsp; provisions of&nbsp; sections 785 and&nbsp; following of the Code of Civil Procedure; and therefore the defendants&nbsp; are not&nbsp; compelled to pay the said sum to the&nbsp; plaintiffs.<br><br>For the foregoing reasons,&nbsp; it is proper, in our opinion, to&nbsp; affirm&nbsp; the judgment appealed&nbsp; from,&nbsp; as&nbsp; we hereby do, except the finding therein whereby the defendants are sentenced to pay P600&nbsp; to the&nbsp; plaintiffs,&nbsp; which finding we expressly reverse.&nbsp;&nbsp; The costs&nbsp; of this&nbsp; instance shall&nbsp; be assessed against the appellants.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano,&nbsp; C. J., Mapa, Moreland,</i> and <i>Trent, JJ.</i>, concur.<br></div>
