				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This defendant was charged&nbsp; with the crime&nbsp; of murder, in the Court of First Instance of the District of Zamboanga. The complaint was as follows:<br><blockquote>"That the said accused on August 20,&nbsp; 1908, in the settlement of Basak, Basilan, tribal subdistrict No.&nbsp; 1, district of Zamboanga, Moro Province,&nbsp; accompanied and aided by a bandit named Akalol, now dead, did willfully, unlawfully and criminally&nbsp; and with <i>alevosia&nbsp; </i>attack&nbsp; and kill with&nbsp; a barong the Moro Pusong, residing in said tribal subdistrict, who had&nbsp; been acting as a guide for the military forces in operations in Basilan against a&nbsp; band of outlaws to which said accused belonged; having inflicted upon the said Moro, Pusong, serious wounds, from which he&nbsp; died; having acted with&nbsp; <i>premeditacion conocida </i>and <i>alevosia;</i> an act constituting&nbsp; the&nbsp; crime of <i>asesinato,</i>&nbsp; defined&nbsp; and&nbsp; penalized by article&nbsp; 403 of the Penal Code&nbsp; and performed within the jurisdiction&nbsp; of&nbsp; this Court of First Instance: in violation of law."<br></blockquote>After hearing the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause, the&nbsp; Hon. Herbert&nbsp; D. Gale,&nbsp; judge, found&nbsp; the defendant guilty of the crime&nbsp; of&nbsp; assassination, with&nbsp; the qualifying circumstance of&nbsp; <i>"premeditation conocida,</i>" and sentenced him to&nbsp; be imprisoned <i>a&nbsp; la pena de cadena perpetua,</i> to&nbsp; indemnify the heirs&nbsp; of the person&nbsp; killed in&nbsp; the sum of one&nbsp; thousand pesos, and to&nbsp; pay the costs of&nbsp; the trial,&nbsp; with the accessory penalties&nbsp; provided&nbsp; for in article 54 of the Penal Code.&nbsp; From that&nbsp; sentence the defendant appealed to this court.<br><br>The only question presented&nbsp; by the appellant is a&nbsp; question as to&nbsp; the sufficiency of the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause to show that the defendant was guilty of the crime charged, beyond peradventure of doubt.<br><br>An examination of the evidence brought to this court shows that the defendant, with his brother, Akalol, at nighttime, on or about the 20th of August, 1908, armed with a <i> barong,</i> did&nbsp; kill the Moro, Pusong,&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; rancheria de Basak, on the Island of Basilan.&nbsp; The commission of the crime&nbsp; was&nbsp; witnessed&nbsp; by the&nbsp; Moros&nbsp; Buciu,&nbsp; Jiclan,&nbsp; and Calila.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; shows that the defendant and his brother, Alkalol, were members <i>"de una&nbsp; partida de malhechores."</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; The evidence further shows that there had&nbsp; been an attempt on the part of the American Army operating in the District of Zamboanga, to capture said band and that the deceased Puson, had&nbsp; been&nbsp; acting as a guide&nbsp; for the American troops.&nbsp; It is believed that the motive for killing Puson was&nbsp; the fact that he had been acting as such guide for the American soldiers.<br><br>The evidence is not very full with reference to the manner in which the crime was committed.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no proof, however, more&nbsp; than&nbsp; a suspicion,&nbsp; that&nbsp; there existed&nbsp; the qualifying&nbsp; circumstance&nbsp; of&nbsp; <i> "premeditacion&nbsp;&nbsp; conocida"</i> Qualifying circumstances must&nbsp; be proven the same as any other element of a crime.&nbsp;&nbsp; (U.&nbsp; S. <i>vs</i>. Borsed, 9 Phil. Rep., 203.)&nbsp; None of the qualifying circumstances of article 403 of the Penal Code were shown&nbsp; to exist in the commission of the crime.&nbsp; The crime can&nbsp; not be qualified, therefore, as murder.&nbsp;&nbsp; The crime committed by the&nbsp; defendant was homicide only.&nbsp; The&nbsp; crime was committed&nbsp; with&nbsp; the qualifying circumstance of nocturnity and with the use of prohibited arms.&nbsp; Therefore the defendant&nbsp; must be punished in the maximum&nbsp; degree of "<span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion temporal.</span>"<br><br>The judgment of the lower&nbsp; court is,&nbsp; therefore, hereby reversed and the defendant&nbsp; is hereby sentenced to be imprisoned for a period of twenty years&nbsp; of "r<span style="font-style: italic;">eclusion temporal,</span>" with the accessory penalties named in article 55 of the Penal Code, to indemnify the heirs&nbsp; of the deceased in the sum of P1,000, and to pay the costs.<br><br><i> Mapa, Carson,&nbsp; Moreland,</i> and <i>Trent, JJ.,</i> concur.<br></div>
