				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The  appellants in this case were convicted in the Court of First Instance of Manila of the crime of brigandage as defined and penalized in section 1 of Act No. 518 of the Philippine  Commission.  Counsel  for the appellants contends that the Court of First Instance was without jurisdiction to impose sentence upon these accused because it does not appear from the evidence that the  crime with which they were charged was committed in the city of Manila.</p>
<p>The  evidence  discloses that the offense was committed, if committed at all, in the Provinces of Bulacan and Rizal and there is no proof tending to sustain the allegation of the complaint that the offense was committed in  the city of Manila.</p>
<p>It appears from the record that the appellants, Rosauro Sabino, Francisco Primoso, and Romualdo  Ramos, were arrested in the  municipality of Caloocan  and that the appellant Balbino Morales was arrested in the municipality of Malabon,  both of which municipalities are beyond the limits of the city Of Manila, and that  they were brought from  the  place  of their arrest to the city of Manila and there tried  upon this complaint alleging  the commission of the crime in the city of Manila and in the Provinces of Bulacan and Rizal.</p>
<p>Section 3 of Act No. 518 defining highway robbery or brigandage  and providing for the punishment thereof, is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Persons  guilty of the crime defined in section one may be punished therefor in the Court of First Instance in any province in  which they may be taken or from which they may have fled."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is clear,  therefore, that the Court of First Instance of Manila  was  without jurisdiction to impose sentence upon these appellants in this case.</p>
<p>It appears that the appellants, Pedro Alapata and Leocadio Reyes were arrested on the complaint filed in this case while they were serving sentence in Bilibid  upon conviction of another and distinct  offense committed in the city of Manila, and we are of opinion that under the provisions of the above-section 3 of Act No. 518 the  court had jurisdiction to try and punish these accused.</p>
<p>The guilt  of the said Pedro Alapata and Leocadio Reyes of the crime with which they were charged was proven beyond a reasonable  doubt  and  we find no  error in  the proceedings prejudicial to their rights.  The judgment and sentence of the trial court in so far as these appellants are concerned should be  and is hereby affirmed, with  their proportionate shares of the costs in this instance."</p>
<p>The sentence of the trial  court, in so far  as  it affects Rosauro Sabino, Francisco Primoso, Romualdo Ramos, and Balbino  Morales, is  reversed, with  their proportionate shares of the costs in  both instances <em>de oficio</em>, but it appearing that there is reasonable ground to believe that they were guilty of the crime of brigandage, they will  not be set at liberty but will be remanded to a court of proper jurisdiction for trial.  (Section 23, General Orders, No. 58.) Let judgment be entered in accordance herewith and  the case be remanded at  the proper time for  proper action. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Willard,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ., </em>concur.<br>
