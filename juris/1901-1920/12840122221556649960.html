				G.R. No. 12710, July 20, 1917</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. ROSAURO ENRIQUEZ ET AL. ROSAURO ENRIQUEZ AND PACIFICO DE GUZMAN, APPELLANTS.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a motion to dismiss the appeal in the case of the appellant Rosauro 
Enriquez, based upon the ground that he had not perfected it in accordance with 
the provisions of the Code of Procedure in Criminal Actions.
<p>An examination of the record shows that the decision of the lower court was 
rendered upon the 28th day of November, 1916, and pronounced upon the same day. 
The said appellant, on the 13th day of December, 1916, presented a motion for a 
new trial, which motion for a new trial was denied on the 27th day of February, 
1917. The said Rosauro Enriquez presented his notice of appeal in writing upon 
the first day of March, 1917.</p>
<p>It is clear, therefore, that the appeal was not perfected within the time 
prescribed by section 43 of General Orders No. 58. The presentation of a motion 
for a new trial in criminal cases does not extend the time for the presentation 
of the appeal. (U. S. <em>vs</em>. Flemister, 1 Phil. Rep., 317; U. S. 
<em>vs</em>. Perez, 1 Phil. Rep., 322; U. S. <em>vs</em>. Recano, 4 Phil. Rep., 
91; U. S. <em>vs.</em> Torrero, 8 Phil. Rep., 88; U. S. <em>vs.</em> Rota, 9 
Phil. Rep., 426; U. S. <em>vs</em>. Court of First Instance of Manila, 24 Phil. 
Rep., 321.)</p>
<p>However, after the presentation of the motion in the present case, the 
attorney for the appellant presented a written statement from the clerk of the 
Court of First Instance of the Province of Rizal, which very feebly indicates 
that the appellant Rosauro Enriquez presented his notice of appeal in writing at 
the same time that his codefendant Pacifico de Guzman presented his, on the 28th 
day of November, 1916. Said clerk alleges as his opinion and belief that each of 
said appellants presented his notice of appeal on the same day, and that he (the 
clerk) was much surprised to learn that the appeal of Rosauro Enriquez was not 
included in the record. The attorney for the appellant, however, in the argument 
of the case, made no such contention. In view, however, of the doubt raised by 
the statement of the said clerk with reference to the question here presented, 
we are inclined to hold that the appeal of Rosauro Enriquez was perfected within 
the time prescribed by law; and that his notice of appeal in writing, filed with 
the clerk below, was lost through no fault of his.</p>
<p>The motion, therefore, is hereby denied.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Carson, Araullo, Street</em>, and <em>Malcolm, JJ.,</em> 
concur.</p></div>
