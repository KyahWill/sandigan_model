				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The question presented by this appeal is; May an administrator of an estate 
of a deceased person continue to administer the estate after a will of such 
deceased is proved and allowed?
<p>The facts upon which that question is based, are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) That Tomasa Nepomuceno died on the 9th day of April, 1913;</p>
<p>(2) That on the 11th day of April, 1913, two days after the death of Tomasa 
Nepomuceno, the defendants herein, presented a petition in the Court of First 
Instance of the Province of Laguna, praying for the appointment of an 
administrator of the estate of the deceased Tomasa Nepomuceno;</p>
<p>(3) That on the 14th day of April, 1913, the plaintiff herein, Santos 
Cartajena, presented a will in the Court of First Instance of the Province of 
Laguna, alleging that it was the last will and testament of Tomasa Nepomuceno, 
and prayed that said will be admitted to probate;</p>
<p>(4) That on the 12th day of July, 1913, the Honorable Vicente Jocson, judge, 
upon a consideration of the petition of the defendants of the 11th day of April, 
1913, appointed the <em>defendants</em> as administrators of said estate;</p>
<p>(5) That on the 19th day of July, 1913, the lower court appointed 
commissioners to hear claims against the estate of the deceased, as it was being 
administered by the <em>defendants</em>;</p>
<p>(6) That on the 30th day of July, 1913, the defendants herein presented their 
opposition to the probation of the alleged will of Tomasa Nepomuceno which had 
therefore been presented for probate on the 14th day of April, 1913;</p>
<p>(7) That on the 30th day of October, 1913, the Honorable Vicente Jocson, 
judge, admitted said will to probate notwithstanding the opposition of the 
defendants herein;</p>
<p>(8) That from the decision admitting said will to probate the defendants duly 
appealed to the Supreme Court. The order legalizing said will was affirmed by 
the Supreme Court on the 15th day of December, 1914,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> the record being returned to the trial 
court on the 30th day of January, 1915; and on the same day the court appointed 
the plaintiff as administrator of the estate of Tomasa Nepomuceno, deceased;</p>
<p>(9) That on the 7th day of February, 1914, the defendants, acting as 
administrator of the said estate, presented a report of their 
administration;</p>
<p>(10) That on the 19th day of February, 1914, the de: fendants, still 
continuing to act as administrators of the estate, presented a motion asking for 
an order of partition of the property of the estate, which motion was granted on 
the 27th day of February, 1914;</p>
<p>(11) That on the 9th day of March, 1915, the plaintiff presented a motion in 
the lower court asking that the court annul and set aside all the proceedings 
which had been taken by the defendants in the course of the administration of 
the estate of Tomasa Nepomuceno, after the presentation of the will, in 
accordance with the provisions of section 657 of Act No. 190.</p>
<p>From the foregoing it will be seen that two administrators were proceeding 
with the administration and settlement of the estate of the deceased, at the 
same time in the same court. It is difficult to understand, in view of the 
provisions of section 657 of Act No. 190, why the court permitted the two 
administrators to continue to act.</p>
<p>Section 657 (Act No. 190) provides that the appointment of an administrator 
shall be revoked if a will is subsequently discovered. Said section 
provides:</p>
<p>"If, after granting letters of administration by a court on the estate of a 
person as if he had died intestate, a will of such deceased person is proved and 
allowed by the court, the letters of administration <em>shall be revoked</em> 
and the powers of the administration cease, and he shall thereupon surrender the 
letters of administration to the court, and render his account within such time 
as the court directs."</p>
<p>The defendants cannot claim ignorance of the presentation of the will for 
probate, for the reason that they appeared in the probate proceedings for the 
legalization of the will and opposed it. The defendants had been appointed 
administrators on the 11th day of April, 1913. The will was presented by the 
plaintiff for probation on the 14th day of April, 1913, and the defendants 
appeared on the 30th day of July, 1913, and opposed the probation of said will. 
Notwithstanding the opposition of the defendants, the Honorable Vicente Jocson, 
judge, admitted said will to probate and appointed the plaintiff as the 
administrator of the estate in question under the will, of which the defendants 
had due notice. Notwithstanding the appointment of an administrator under the 
will, the defendants continued to act as administrators of the estate in 
accordance with the appointment of the 12th of July, 1913. Having full knowledge 
that a will had been presented, proved and allowed, it is difficult to 
understand how the defendants could have continued in good faith with the 
administration of the estate.</p>
<p>Considering that the defendants had full knowledge of the existence of the 
will as well as the fact that the same had been proved and allowed; and</p>
<p>Considering that the defendants, in disregard of the provisions of said 
section 657, continued in the course of the administration of said estate after 
such knowledge, it is hereby ordered and decreed:</p>
<p>(<em>a</em>) That the letters of administration heretofore granted to the 
defendants be revoked;</p>
<p>(<em>b</em>) That they render an account of their administration to the court 
within a time to be fixed by the lower court; and</p>
<p>(<em>c</em>) That they immediately turn over to the plaintiff, as 
administrators of said estate, all property and effects which came into their 
hands by virtue of their appointments as administrators.</p>
<p>It is further provided and decreed that all persons holding claims against 
the estate, and which were presented for allowance to the commissioners in the 
administration of the estate by the defendants, shall be considered to have been 
submitted to the commissioners appointed in the administration of the estate by 
the plaintiff as of the date when they were presented to the first 
commissioners. The claimants who presented their claims in due time should not 
be prejudiced by anything ordered or decreed herein.</p>
<p>With the foregoing modifications, the judgment of the lower court is hereby 
affirmed, without any finding as to costs. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Street, Malcolm, Avance√±a</em>, and <em>Fisher, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
