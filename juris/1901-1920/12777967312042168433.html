				G.R. No. 12958, November 28, 1917</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. JAO LI SING (ALIAS CHUA WAT), CHOA SEEM, AND GO PO, DEFENDANTS. JAO LI SING AND CHOA SEEM APPELLANTS.

				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, the defendants Jao Li 
Sing alias Chua Wat, Choa Seem, and Go Po were charged with the illegal 
possession of opium. Jao Li Sing was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for 
a period of five months, to pay a fine of P500, and to pay one third of the 
costs. Choa Seem was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for a period of six 
months, to pay a fine of P500, and to pay one third of the costs. Go Po was 
acquitted. Jao Li Sing and Choa Seem have appealed.
<p>The facts as found by the trial court, and which we should not disturb 
without good reason, may be stated briefly as follows: The defendant Choa Seem 
was in 1916 the owner of a hotel for Chinamen located at No. 640, Calle Juan 
Luna, city of Manila. The defendant Jao Li Sing lived in the same house and was 
the assistant to Choa Seem. When arrested, the two defendants had occupied the 
house for the period of a year. About 2 o'clock on the afternoon of September 
22, 1916, the police came to search the house for opium. They were required to 
wait about eight minutes before the door was opened. They found in the house the 
two defendants and other Chinamen. The main room was full of smoke and the odor 
of opium was apparent. On a search, the police discovered 2 kilos and 91 grams 
of opium and 610 grams of opium ash. This opium together with numerous other 
articles for its use was found secreted under an aparador and in the attic. A 
towel with stains of opium was also discovered. Water in a washbasin was taken, 
and on analysis found to contain traces of opium. The defendants endeavored to 
establish that they were ignorant of the existence of the contraband, that the 
contraband might have been the property of some of the guests, that the opium 
and opium ash as well as the pipes and other instruments are old, and that the 
water contained in the bottles as well as the towel had been used on the day of 
the search by Captain Manning.</p>
<p>Appellants allege six errors.</p>
<ol><li>The first assignment of error is that the trial court erred in not esteeming 
the testimony of Alejandro Herrera. The trial court was surely warranted in not 
believing a portion of the testimony of Alejandro Herrera in view of the quality 
and quantity of evidence contradicting and refuting his statements.<br><br>
</li><li>The second assignment of error is that the trial court erred in admitting 
the exhibits presented by the prosecution and in presuming that they are the 
property of the accused. The trial court was justified from every aspect of the 
case in admitting these exhibits.<br><br>
</li><li>The third assignment of error is that the trial court erred in not 
appreciating the absence of <em>animus possidendi </em>on the part of the 
accused. The rule as to <em>animus possidendi</em> is as stated in United States 
<em>vs</em>. Bandoc ([1912], 23 Phil., 14), in which it is held that, "While it 
is true that in the case of United States <em>vs.</em> Tan Tayco and Co Sencho 
(12 Phil. Rep., 739) we held that the discovery of opium in the house or upon 
the premises of an accused person is not conclusive evidence that such opium was 
in his possession and control, nevertheless it is under the law <em>prima 
facie</em> evidence to that effect, and is sufficient to sustain a conviction in 
the absence of a satisfactory explanation." In connection with this rule, it 
should further be noted that, as was said in the case of United States 
<em>vs</em>. Tin Masa ([1910] 17 Phil., 463), "direct proof of facts of this 
nature in a criminal proceeding is rarely forthcoming, except in cases of 
confession, and their existence may, and usually must be inferred from the 
varying circumstances in each particular case." An analogous rule was recently 
announced in the case of United States <em>vs</em>. Sy Toon ([1917], 36 Phil., 
736), by which the existence of an opium joint could be established by facts and 
circumstances tending to prove that it was such. We have, therefore, to resolve 
whether the explanation of the defendants to the effect that they were ignorant 
of the presence of the opium is satisfactory, or whether on the contrary there 
are circumstances from which <em>animus possidendi</em> can be inferred. We have 
as circumstantial evidence against the accused their conduct when apprehended, 
the condition of the room in which they were found with a strong odor of opium, 
the water and towel showing traces of opium, the barricaded nature of the house, 
and their being in control of a place said not to be a hotel at all but merely a 
gambling and opium den. We think that the circumstantial evidence herein is 
sufficient to warrant a finding of animus possidendi.<br><br>
</li><li>This assignment of error is covered in No. 3.<br><br>
</li><li>This assignment of error relates to the question of reasonable doubt, a 
discussion of which would not prove profitable.<br><br>
</li><li>The sixth assignment of error raises the question of the validity of Act No. 
2381, the Opium Law. There are two branches to this assignment. In the first 
place it is contended that the penalty imposed by the Opium Law for the illegal 
possession of opium is violative of those provisions of the Philippine Bill of 
Rights, prohibiting the imposition of excessive fines, or the infliction of 
cruel and unusual punishment. This question was decided against such an argument 
in United States <em>vs</em>. Valera Ang Y ([1914] 26 Phil., 598), and need not 
therefore be again discussed. The second claim of appellant is that Act No. 2381 
is repugnant to the Act of Congress of January 15, 1915 (December 17, 1914). 
This contention also has been adversely disposed of by this-court in United 
States <em>vs.</em> Tan Oco ([1916] 34 Phil., 772), holding that Act No. 2381 
has not been repealed by the said Act of Congress. The late case of United 
States<em> vs.</em> Wayne Shoup ([1916] 35 Phil., 56) further found the local 
opium law to be valid. </li></ol>
<p>Believing that we should not disturb the findings of the trial court, having 
disposed of the assignments of error of the appellants, and finding the penalty 
imposed to be within the discretionary limits fixed by law, it results that the 
judgment of the lower court should be, and is hereby affirmed, with one-half of 
the costs of this instance against each appellant. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson, Carson, Araullo, Street,</em> and 
<em>Avancena, JJ.</em>, concur.</p></div>
