				<H3>EVARISTA SINAPILO, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. PETRA GRACIA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">A bill of exceptions in this case was forwarded to us through an appeal taken 
by the defendant from a judgment rendered on December 16,1912, by the Honorable 
Herbert D. Gale, judge of the Court of First Instance. In the said judgment, it 
was held that the plaintiff was the absolute owner in fee simple and entitled to 
the possession of the parcel of land in question, and the defendant, who 
unlawfully held the said land, was ordered immediately to restore possession 
thereof to the plaintiff and to pay the costs in the Court of First Instance and 
the justice of the peace court. The defendant was also perpetually enjoined from 
in any manner disturbing1 the plaintiff in her possession of the said land.
<p>On May 9, 1912, Evarista Sinapilo, with the permission of her husband, sued 
in the justice of the peace court of Candelaria, Tayabas, for the recovery of 
possession of a parcel of land belonging to her, valued at P150, which had been 
detained and held since the previous year by the defendant, Petra Gracia, but 
the latter, in her answer, denied that the plaintiff possessed any title of 
ownership to the said land or that she, the defendant, had unlawfully held and 
detained the land in question, and she therefore prayed that she be absolved 
from the complaint, with the costs against the plaintiff.</p>
<p>After a hearing of the case, the justice of the peace rendered judgment for 
the plaintiff, from which the defendant appealed to the Court of First 
Instance.</p>
<p>The plaintiff consequently reproduced before the said appellate court the 
complaint she had filed in the justice of the peace court. Counsel for the 
defendant, after denying each and all of the paragraphs of the same, excepting 
the facts admissible at trial and in special defense, alleged in an additional 
answer that the land in dispute was acquired by the defendant and her deceased 
husband, Juan Gala, from Tomas Regidor, in 1889; that since that time she had 
held the property quietly, peaceably and without any interruption whatever, and 
that the plaintiff's action had already prescribed. Said counsel therefore 
prayed that the defendant be absolved from the complaint, with the costs against 
the plaintiff.</p>
<p>After trial in the Court of First Instance the judgment aforementioned was 
rendered, to which counsel for the defendant excepted and moved for a new 
hearing. This motion was denied by an order of February 7, 1913, and the 
defendant entered a written exception and announced her intention to file a bill 
of exceptions because Acts Nos. 2041 and 2131 of the Philippine Legislature, 
which are in conflict with the Philippine Bill of July 1, 1902, and the Organic 
Act, No. 186, were applied in the present case; she further alleged that the 
judgment was executed over the protest of the defendant that her motion for 
rehearing was still pending.</p>
<p>By a written motion of March 3, 1913, plaintiff's counsel prayed that the 
exception taken on the 13th of the previous month of February against the said 
judgment be overruled and the bill of exceptions presented be rejected, because 
the judgment of the Court of First Instance, being rendered on appeal from the 
court of the justice of the peace of Candelaria, was already conclusive and 
final. He maintained that the constitutional question set up as a ground for the 
defendant's appeal was not raised either in the justice of the peace court or in 
the Court of First Instance, neither before nor after the rendering of judgment 
by.the latter tribunal, but only after twelve days had elapsed from the denial 
of the motion for a rehearing; that both the exception to the order issued on 
the motion for a rehearing and the. bill of exceptions were filed after time, 
for as the said motion was denied on February 7, 1913, the defendant failed to 
take exception thereto within the legal period, and furthermore had no intention 
of excepting to that ruling, inasmuch as on the 15th of the same month of 
February counsel for the son of the defendant Petra Gracia filed a suit in the 
Court of First Instance against Antonio Ona and his wife, the plaintiff Evarista 
Sinapilo, with respect to the very same land, involved in the present suit; that 
he mentioned therein as one of the causes of action the fact that the said 
spouses were in possession of the land in litigation by reason of the judgment 
of December 16,1912, now appealed from, and he submitted a copy of the said 
written complaint; that not till the 19th of the same month did the defendant 
for the first time raise the question of the constitutionality of the laws 
aforementioned and take exception to the judgment of the Court of First 
Instance, after it had already become final. Counsel therefore prayed that the 
court grant the prayer of his petition, and, in case it should be disallowed, 
that the court order the present motion, the ruling thereon and, if a denial, 
his exception thereto, included in the bill of exceptions. Both the regular and 
the additional bills of exceptions having been filed, they were approved and 
sent up with a transcript of the record of the proceedings referred to by the 
appellant, and of the parol evidence, to the clerk of this court.<br><br>In 
order to determine whether or not the Court of First Instance lacked 
jurisdiction to render the judgment appealed from, it becomes necessary to 
inquire whether the constitutional question and that of the jurisdiction of the 
justice of the peace of Candelaria to try the action for recovery of possession 
brought by Evarista Sinapilo, who, as owner, demanded the restitution of a piece 
of her land valued at P150, were brought up in due time at the hearing.</p>
<p>That the action for recovery brought by the plaintiff against the defendant, 
by reason of the latter's unlawful usurpation and detention of the land in 
question, was not one that lay within the jurisdiction of the justice of the 
peace court of Calendaria, is undoubted, since it involved the title and 
ownership of real estate. Therefore the trial held before the said justice of 
the peace is completely null and void and can produce no legal effect whatever 
because of his clear lack of jurisdiction to try the question brought up before 
him by the interested parties relative to the ownership of a piece of land.</p>
<p>However, the defendant having appealed from the judgment rendered by the 
justice of the peace in favor of the plaintiff, the case in its entirety was 
heard by the Court of First Instance, and during the whole course of the trial 
until the judgment appealed from was rendered on December 16,1912, no 
constitutional question whatever was raised and no exception was taken to the 
lack of jurisdiction of the justice of the peace to try the case, or of the 
judge of first instance to exercise his appellate jurisdiction. Not until after 
judgment had been rendered did the appellant, in her petition of February 21, 
1913, raise the question of constitutionality.</p>
<p>In a case like the one at bar, where no question of lack of jurisdiction was 
raised either in the justice of the peace court or in the Court of First 
Instance, and where no objection was made to the jurisdiction of the justice of 
the peace or of the judge of first instance in the exercise of his appellate 
jurisdiction, if the latter is empowered and has original jurisdiction to try 
the case by reason of the subject matter involved, a complaint brought before 
him relative to the ownership of a parcel of real estate will be considered as 
presented for the first time and the judge of first instance will be deemed to 
have taken cognizance of the case by reason of his original jurisdiction, 
inasmuch as during the trial no exception whatever was taken on the ground of 
lack of jurisdiction of the justice of the peace or of the judge of first 
instance in his appellate jurisdiction. For these reasons the trial is 
understood to have been validly held in first instance. Consequently, an appeal 
from the judgment of the Court of First Instance would be proper and the Supreme 
Court can decide such appeal in this second in stance. (Carroll and Ballesteros 
<em>vs.</em> Paredes, 17 Phil. Rep., 94.)</p>
<p>In order that the said exception of lack of jurisdiction on the part of the 
justice of the peace or of the judge of first instance may be sustained, it is 
imperative that at least it be made at the hearing of the case in the Court of 
First Instance and prior to the rendition of judgment. If this requisite is 
omitted, no attention or consideration can be given to the exception upon the 
hearing of the appeal before the Supreme Court, for the reason of its having 
been taken out of season and dehors the trial by the Court of First Instance. 
Such an important omission cannot be repaired by entering the exception after 
judgment has been pronounced, nor by alleging it as a ground for the appeal to 
this court.</p>
<p>For the foregoing reasons, whereby the errors assigned to the judgment 
appealed from have been refuted, the said judgment is held to be in accordance 
with law and should be, as it is hereby, affirmed, with the costs against the 
appellant.</p>
