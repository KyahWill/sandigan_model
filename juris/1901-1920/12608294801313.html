				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The defendants in this case Avere charged with the  crime of robbery with homicide (<em>robo con homicidio</em>), alleged to have been committed as  follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"On the night of the 28th of December, 1904, the accused assaulted the house  of  Dalmacio  Indap,  situated in the barrio of Anilao of the municipality of Pinamalayan in the Province of Mindoro, and by  means  of intimidation and violence appropriated to themselves  12 pesos and 50 centavos, in silver;  a  shirt, and a  tortoise-shell  comb ornamented with gold valued at 4 pesos,  the property of the owner of the said house; and killed Rufino Calderon, a servant of the said owner of the house; said crime was committed against the provisions of paragraph 1 of article 503 of the Penal Code."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before entering  upon  the  trial,  the  complaint was dismissed as to Julian Macalalad, on motion of the prosecuting attorney, on the ground that he did not have sufficient evidence to sustain the charge as to him.</p>
<p>Gelasio de la Pe単a, Juan Aguila, Pructuoso Esguerra, and Clem en te Sol is were convicted of the crime with which they were charged and  on all and each of them the trial court imposed  the penalty of death.</p>
<p>None of the defendants appealed, but,  in  accordance with the provisions of law in such cases, the record has been forwarded to this court for examination and review. Gelasio de la Pefia having died in Bilibid Prison on the  25th day of October, 1905,  the complaint should be, and is hereby, dismissed as to him, with his proportionate share of the costs <em>de oficio.</em></p>
<p>The following is a summary of the pertinent evidence disclosed by the record:</p>
<p>Salvador Camara testified that he was in the house of Dalmacio Indap on  the night  of the 28th of December, 1904, and with him  at  that time were Dalmacio  Indap, Dominga  Capangyarihan, the  wife  of  Dalmacio  Indap, and Rufino Calderon; that on the said night Gelasio de la Pefia, Clemente Sol is, and one Fausto, who was absent at the time of the  trial, entered the house and came upstairs; that these persons, being armed, by means of threats and violence, took and carried away the sum of 5 pesos; that Fructuoso, one of the accused, together with  Julian, attacked Dalmacio Indap;  that the witness and Rufino Calderon were  bound and  taken downstairs;  that  when they came downstairs the accused  Clemente Solis and Juan Aguila were waiting below; that the accused Gelasio de la Pe単a and Clemente Soils took the witness and the said Rirftno Calderon out into a field; that the witness was tied to a tree, and that  Rufino Calderon was taken some little distance farther away and killed by the said Gelasio and  Clemente,  for the reason  that the robbers believed that Rufino Oalderon recognized who they were.  In the course of  the testimony of this witness, when called  upon to identify the person who struck the deceased, he pointed to a bystander in the court room, one Alejo Reyes,  identifying him as the guilty person, and it appears from the" record that in doing so the witness mistook this individual for one of the defendants on  trial.</p>
<p>Dalmacio Indap testified that on  the night of the 28th of  December, 1904,  he was  sleeping in his house and was awakened by some armed persons, who entered and demanded  money; that the persons entering the  house were Gelasio de la Pe単a, Fructuoso fesguerra, and another who was absent at the time of the trial; that after being wounded  and abused by said persons, he gave them  12 pesos and 50 centavos, a shirt, and a comb; that in the house with him at the time were his wife, Salvador Camara, and Rufino Oalderon;  that the persons who entered the house, after tying the said Salvador Camara and Rufino Calderon,  took them out of the, house into the field; that five persons came to his house, including the three who came upstairs, but  that he did not know  the  two who remained  downstairs;  that he  believed  that one of the attacking  party had been wounded  above the knee  with a dagger.</p>
<p>Dominga Capangyarihan, wife of  Dalmacio Indap, testified that she and her companions  were sleeping in the house on the night of the 28th of December, 1904, when three armed persons entered and by  means of threats and violence compelled her husband to  deliver  to  them  12 pesos and 50 centavos, a  shirt, and a comb;  that the shirt and comb were  worth 4 pesos and 25 centavos; that of the three who entered the  house  she recognized Fructuoso Esguerra; that those who entered the house tied Salvador Camara and Rufino Calderon and carried them out of the house and into the field;  and that Rufino Calderon never returned to the  house  because he had  been killed by the persons who carried him away.</p>
<p>Ruperto Macalalad, whose  name  was included  in the original complaint filed in this case, and as to whom the complaint was dismissed for  lack  of  evidence, testified that on the evening of the 28th of December,  1904, Fructuoso Esguerra came to see him and invited him to go to the barrio of Anilao for the purpose of robbing the house of  Dalmacio Indap; that  the witness asked Esguerra who were his companions; that the latter stated that they were Gelasio de la Pe単a, Fausto Lualhati, and Juan Aguila; and that he did not accompany the party and did not know whether the party had carried out their plan  to rob the house of Dalmacio Indap or not.</p>
<p>Isidro Umali testified that he was a councilor of  the barrio of Anilao; that the robbery of the house of Dalmacio Indap had been reported to him as well as the death of Rufino Calderon; that he and others found the dead body of Rufino Calderon near the banks of a river called Papay; that Fructuoso Esguerra confessed to him that he was one of the persons guilty of the said robbery, and that his companions were Gelasio de la Peiia, Juan Aguila, Clemente Solis, and another whose name the witness did not remember;  that  Fructnoso Esguerra  testified in his own behalf at the preliminary trial held  by  the justice of the peace of Pinamalayan; that on that occasion  Fructuoso Esguerra. again  admitted  that he was one of the persons who committed  the robbery and that he, Fructuoso Esguerra,  was present when Gelasio de la Peiia, with Juan Aguila,  killed the deceased.</p>
<p>Gelasio de la  Pefia, the accused  who died  in Bilibid Prison pending  the review  of this case, testified on his own behalf and  said that  he was a servant of one Atong, and that he made k confession before the justice of the peace because his master ordered him to, and had promised to cancel his debts and give him 300 pesos; that he took no part  in said robbery and knew nothing about it. Juan Aguila testified in his own behalf and  denied all knowledge of the robbery in the house of Dalmacio Indap, and explained a scar  of a wound above his left knee by saying that he had been bitten by a fish on  the day he was arrested.</p>
<p>Fructuoso Esguerra testified in his own behalf and said that he did not take part in the robbery of the house of Dalmacio Indap and that on the day  in question he was in the house of one Pacio Maliung<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 
 in the barrio of Cucel; that he remembered  having made a statement in the court of the justice of the peace of Pinamalayan, but that the statement he  made  then was not  true and that he had signed the said statement because he feared he  would be punished if  he did not do so.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned  Isidro  Umali, councilor of the barrio of Anilao, declared that he was present in the court of the justice of the peace when Fructuoso Esguerra made his statement, and that no threats, force, or violence of any kind was used to secure the confession made at that time.</p>
<p>From  an  examination of the foregoing testimony it will be seen  that  the  identity of Clemente Solis and Juan Aguila as members of the party who committed the offense charged  in the complaint rests solely upon  the testimony of the witness Salvador Camara.   This witness appears to have been an ignorant man; in various minor details his testimony is uncertain and confused, and although we are inclined  to  believe that his testimony  during the trial of this case was true, to the best of his knowledge and belief, we do not think that his uncorroborated testimony establishes the identity of these accused beyond a reasonable doubt.  The statement of Ruperto Macalalad was, as to these defendants, admittedly  hearsay; and the confessions of Fructuoso Esguerra and Gelasio de la Pefia were only admissible as evidence against themselves, and could not be used against their coaccused, unless  it were fully established by other evidence that these coaccused'  were members of the party who jointly  committed the  crime.</p>
<p>We are of opinion that, though there is much in the record to cast suspicion upon these defendants,  a finding of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt can not be sustained as to them.</p>
<p>We are satisfied, however,  that  the  guilt of Fructuoso Esguerra is  established  by the evidence of record beyond a reasonable doubt.   Not only was he identified by Salvador Camara, but also by Dalmacio Indap and his wife, Dominga Capangyarihan.  He it was who invited Ruperto Maealalad to join a party which he said was going  to commit the crime upon the night of the 28th of December. This evidence of itself would probably  be sufficient  to identify him with the painty committing  the  offense, but in addition it was shown that he had twice confessed his participation in the crime and that he was one of the party who committed the robbery and was present at the murder of the deceased,  Rufino Calderon.</p>
<p>While it does not appear that this  defendant  himself struck the fatal blow which caused the death of Rufino Calderon, he must be adjudged guilty as  principal of the complex crime of robbery with homicide with which he is charged, it having been proved that he was present, aided, abetted, and  took part therein.  The testimony  of the witnesses for the prosecution fully establishes the guilt  of the defendant as a principal in the commission of the robbery, and, even were we to disregard his confession, which he repudiated at the trial of the case, and wherein he admitted he was present at the  killing of Rufino Oalderon, we would, nevertheless, be compelled to find him guilty  of the crime of <em>robo con homicidio </em>(robbery with homicide). The supreme court of Spain, interpreting the provisions  of the Penal Code touching the  complex crime of <em>robo con homicidio</em> has frequently decided that, where the complex crime has been committed, all those who took part as principals in the commission of the robbery are guilty as principals in the commission of the crime of robo con, homieidio, unless it appears that they endeavored to  prevent the unlawful killing.   (Decisions of the supreme court of Spain, April 30 and February 23, 1872, and June 19, 1890. See also Viada, vol. 3, pp. 347, 354, and 356.)</p>
<p>Accepting as  true  the exculpatory  statements  of  the accused in his repudiated confession, it does  not  appear therefrom that he made any genuine effort to prevent the murder of Rufino Calderon.</p>
<p>Sentence was imposed in the maximum degree because the trial court was of opinion  that the commission of the crime was marked with the following aggravating circumstances: First, <em>alevosia</em> (treachery);  second, at night, in a deserted place, and  by an armed band; third, ensanamiento  (<em>ensa単amiento</em>, when means are employed or circumstances brought about which  add ignominy to the natural effect of the act).   We do not think that the latter circumstance was established by the record,  but it  was conclusively  proven  that the  crime was committed with "treachery," at nighttime,  in a deserted place, and by an armed band, and the penalty was,  therefore,  correctly imposed on Fructuoso Esguerra in its maximum degree.</p>
<p>Pending the review of this case, a motion for a new trial was submitted by counsel for the appellants on the ground of "newly discovered evidence."  It is alleged that at the trial  of one Fausto Lualhati,  who  was  arrested  some time after the conclusion of the trial of these accused and charged with the same crime, the witness Salvador Camara declared on oath that he did not know  or  recognize any of those  who entered the house of Dalmacio Indap on the night of the 28th of December,  1904, and  that the party was composed of but three individuals.   The acquittal of Clemente Solis and Juan Aguila renders this new evidence of no importance as to them, and  the identification of Fructuoso  Esguerra having been established  beyond  a reasonable doubt, without the aid of the testimony of this witness,  we do not think that the introduction of the new evidence could affect the result; hence  motion for a new trial for the  purpose of introducing it  should be, and is hereby, denied.</p>
<p>The judgment of the trial court, in  so far as it convicts the defendants Olemente Solis and Juan Aguila, is reversed and they are hereby acquitted of the crime with which they are charged, aad will be set at liberty forthwith, with their proportionate share of the costs <em>de oficio.</em></p>
<p>The judgment of conviction and the  sentence of the trial court as to Fructuoso Esguerra is affirmed, with his proportionate  share of the costs  of the  proceedings against him.  So ordered.</p>
