				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This action was commenced in the Court of First Instance of the Province of 
Pampanga on the 10th day of October, 1910. The petitioner alleged that he was 
the owner of a piece or parcel of land which is particularly described in 
paragraph 2 of the complaint; that the defendants, without right or 
justification, were illegally and maliciously interfering with the petitioner's 
possession of said land and would undoubtedly continue to molest him and 
interfere with his peaceful enjoyment of said property unless they were enjoined 
from so doing. The petitioner prayed for both a preliminary and perpetual 
injunction. A bond was given by the plaintiff in the sum of P1,500 and a 
preliminary injunction was issued. Each of the defendants were served with a 
copy of the complaint on the 27th day of October, 1910, together with a copy of 
the preliminary injunction issued.
<p>On the 10th day of November, 1910, the defendant Hipolito Balatbat entered an 
appearance in said case. For the reason that none of the said defendants 
answered the petition within the time fixed by law, the petitioner presented a 
motion for a judgment by default, which was granted by the Hon. Julio Llorente 
upon the 26th day of November, 1910. The case was finally set down for hearing 
and was heard upon the 4th day of January, 1911. After hearing the proof adduced 
by the plaintiff, a judgment was rendered on the same day ordering and enjoining 
the defendants, their agents and representatives, and all other persons acting 
in their behalf, to desist in their acts of whatever character which molested or 
tended to molest the plaintiff in the peaceful enjoyment of the possession of 
his property. A copy of said final injunction was served upon the 
defendants.</p>
<p>Later, on the 15th day of June, 1914, the plaintiff presented an affidavit in 
the court below, alleging that the defendant Hipolito Balatbat, his agents and 
representatives had maliciously and illegally and by means of violence committed 
acts in violation of the terms of said injunction, and prayed that said 
defendant and his representatives should be cited to appear to show why they 
should not be punished for a violation of the injunction theretofore granted. In 
accordance with said citation or order the defendant Hipolito Balatbat and 
others appeared. Hipolito Balatbat confessed that he was guilty of a violation 
of said injunction, but attempted to excuse his acts upon the theory that he was 
the owner of the parcel of land in question. The same confession and the same 
defense were presented by the other persons who had been cited to appear and 
explain why they had violated said injunction. After hearing the confession of 
the defendant Hipolito Balatbat, the Hon. Julio Llorente found that he was 
guilty of a violation of said final injunction and imposed a fine upon him in 
the sum of P50, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency. From that 
sentence he appealed to this Court. The other persons cited to show why they 
should not be punished for contempt were not punished.</p>
<p>In his first assignment of error, the appellant alleges that the lower court 
committed an error in sentencing him to a fine without having first presented a 
complaint in due form in accordance with the provisions of General Orders No. 
58, and in declaring that he had not been duly notified of the injunction 
therefor rendered. The appellant, in his argument in support of said error, 
makes no reference to the provisions of General Orders No. 58, but alleges that 
the procedure followed in the lower court was not in accordance with the 
provisions of articles Nos. 231 and 232 of Act No. 190. The record shows that 
the appellant had been ordered not to do certain particular acts described in 
the injunction, and that he had notice of said injunction; that after the lapse 
of more than three years, after being cited to show cause why he had violated 
said injunction, and after due hearing was given him, he confessed that he had 
violated said order but attempted to justify his acts. The record shows that a 
complaint had been presented in writing and filed with the clerk, and that he 
had been given an opportunity to be heard in accordance with the provisions of 
article 233 of Act No. 190. The procedure in the court below was entirely 
regular and in accordance with the provisions of the law.</p>
<p>In his second assignment of error he alleges that the lower court committed 
an error in hearing the case and condemning the appellant. The only argument in 
support of said error is that, inasmuch as the lower court had issued the 
injunction, it is not just for it to consider the questions presented for a 
violation of the same. In reply to that argument it may be noted first that no 
objection was presented or challenge made to the hearing of the question 
relating to the violation of said injunction by the lower court; and second the 
record does not show any reason why the Hon. Julio Llorente was not fully 
competent to inquire into the question whether or not his order of injunction 
had been violated. The judge who grants an injunction may punish those who 
violate its mandates.</p>
<p>In his third assignment of error the appellant alleges that the lower court 
committed an error in condemning the defendant for "desacato;" and in support of 
that assignment alleges that there was no proof showing that the defendant had 
violated the terms of said injunction. In reply to that argument it is 
sufficient to say that the defendant and appellant himself admitted that he had 
violated the terms of said injunction; and the only excuse offered therefor was 
the fact that he claimed to be the owner of the lands in question.</p>
<p>While, we find nothing in the record which would justify a reversal of the 
penalty imposed by the lower court for the violation of the terms of the 
injunction, yet, considering the apparent ignorance of the defendant and 
appellant, we are of the opinion that every purpose of the plaintiff in justice 
and equity may be conserved by a modification of said fine. Therefore, the 
judgment of the lower court is hereby modified; and it is hereby ordered and 
decreed that a fine of P5 only be imposed upon the defendant, and the costs. So 
ordered.</p>
<p>Moreover, in view of the constant practice which we have observed in certain 
of the judicial districts of the Courts of First Instance in granting 
injunctions for the purpose of obtaining possession of land, we deem it proper 
to make the following observations:</p>
<ol><li>That injunction should not be granted to take property out of the possession 
and control of one party and to place it in the hands of another whose title has 
not been clearly established by law. Another adequate, summary and speedy remedy 
exists for almost every case. (Devesa <em>vs</em>. Arbes, 13 Phil. Rep., 273; 
Palafox <em>vs</em>. Madamba, 19 Phil. Rep., 444; Evangelista <em>vs</em>. 
Pedreños, 27 Phil. Rep., 648; Gilchrist <em>vs</em>. Cuddy, 29 Phil. Rep., 
542.)</li><p></p><li>The writ of injunction is one of the special remedies provided by the Code 
of Civil Procedure (Act No. 190). It should not be issued except upon condition 
that no other ordinary, speedy and adequate remedy is available to avoid or 
repair the damage done, or which may be done by a new violation of the 
plaintiff's rights. (Palafox <em>vs</em>. Madamba, 19 Phil. Rep., 444; Gilchrist 
<em>vs</em>. Cuddy, 29 Phil. Rep., 542.)</li><p></p><li>That an injunction for the issuance of which provision is made in the Code 
of Civil Procedure, while it resemble the <em>interdictal </em>actions of the 
Spanish procedural law in some respect, is wholly distinct therefrom and, as a 
rule, the circumstances under which, in accordance with the Spanish law, 
"interdictos de adquirir, de retener, de recobrar, o de despojo" were properly 
issued would not justify nor sustain the issuance of an injunction as defined in 
said Code. (Devesa <em>vs</em>. Arbes, 13 Phil. Rep., 273.)</li><p></p><li>While the writ of injunction may be issued to restrain acts of trespass and 
the illegal interference with the possession of land, the cases are very few 
when said writ should issue ex parte and before the defendant is given a 
hearing; and it should never issue when an action for damages would adequately 
compensate the injuries caused. The very foundation of the jurisdiction to issue 
the writ rests in the probability of irreparable injury, the inadequacy of 
pecuniary compensation, and the prevention of the multiplicity of suits, and 
where facts are not shown to bring the case within these conditions, the relief 
of injunction should be refused. (Western Union Telegraph Co. <em>vs</em>. 
Judkins, 75 Ala., 428; High on Injunctions, section 697; Clark <em>vs</em>. 
Jeffersonville R. R. Co., 44 Ind., 248; Poughkeepsie Gas Co. <em>vs</em>. 
Citizens' Gas Co., 89 N. Y., 493.)</li><p></p><li>Injunctions to prevent trespass and the illegal interference with the 
possession of land should not be granted, when the plaintiff's title is in 
dispute and has not been established at law, until the question of title is 
settled in a proper proceeding brought for that purpose. (Maloon <em>vs</em>. 
White, 57 N. H., 152; Greasap <em>vs</em>. Kemble, 26 W. Va., 603.)</li><p></p><li>There are cases, however, where an injunction may be granted in order to 
preserve the <em>statu quo</em> of property until the title can be determined in 
a proper action. (Clayton <em>vs</em>. Shoemaker and Newcomer, 67 Md., 216.) But 
even then it should not be granted <em>ex parte</em>. The defendant should be 
given an opportunity to be heard.</li><p></p><li>The remedy by injunction is never the proper remedy to deprive a person of 
the possession of property. If the person in possession is in possession 
illegally there exist other adequate, speedy and summary remedies—forcible entry 
and detainer and ejectment. These remedies are adequate. (Devesa <em>vs</em>. 
Arbes, 13 Phil. Rep., 273; Palafox <em>vs.</em> Madamba, 19 Phil. Rep., 
444.)</li></ol>
<p>In the present action had the defendants appeared when they were cited so to 
do and alleged and showed that they were in possession of the land in question 
as owners thereof, the action would have resolved itself into one of desahucio 
or ejectment, and a motion properly presented and properly supported to dissolve 
the temporary injunction would have been denied. Of course, upon the theory of 
the plaintiff, as presented in the record, that he was the owner of the land in 
question and in possession thereof—and that fact not having been denied—and that 
the defendants were mere trespassers thereon and were illegally and maliciously 
interfering and molesting the plaintiff in his quiet and peaceable enjoyment of 
the possession of his property, then injunction was the proper remedy for the 
purpose of preventing a repetition of said illegal acts. (Maloon <em>vs</em>. 
White, 57 N. H., 152.)</p>
<p>The remedy by injunction is the proper remedy to prevent repeated trespasses 
upon real property. (Merced Mining Co. <em>vs</em>. Fremont, 7 Cal., 130; 
Anderson <em>vs</em>. Harvey's Heirs, 10 Grattan [Va.], 386; Jerome <em>vs.</em> 
Ross, 7 Johnson's Ch. Rep., 315.) But the trespass which will be enjoined must 
be of such a nature that an action for damages will not adequately compensate 
the loss occasioned thereby. (Smith <em>vs</em>. Pettingill, 15 Vt. 82; Norton 
<em>vs</em>. Snyder, 4 Thomp. &amp; C, 330.) So ordered.</p><em>Arellano, C. J., 
Araullo, Street</em>, and <em>Malcolm, JJ.,</em> concur. <br><br><br>
<hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1">

<p>CARSON, J., dissenting:</p>
<p>I dissent.</p>
<p>I am convinced that the grant of the preliminary injunction in this case was 
clearly unauthorized by law, illegal and voidable if not absolutely void.</p>
<p>It is very evident that the court below wholly misapprehended the nature of 
the writ, and granted it improvidently in the erroneous belief that the 
circumstances under which the special remedy of injunction furnished by the new 
Code of Civil Procedure may be invoked are substantially the same as those under 
which the <em>interdictal</em> actions of the Spanish law were maintained, and 
under which <em>interdictos de adquirir, de retener and de recobrar or de 
despojo</em> issued under that system. (Devesa <em>vs</em>. Arbes, 13 Phil. 
Rep., 273.)</p></div>
