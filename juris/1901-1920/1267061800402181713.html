				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">An appeal by the defendants from the order directing delivery of pawned 
jewels. A complaint was presented by the prosecuting attorney charging Marcelina 
Bantog with having defrauded Quintina Reyes of various jewels, described in said 
complaint, and which the accused received to sell on commission for P400, tfhe 
value thereof, obligating herself to return them to their owner in case they 
should not be sold, or in case of their sale to deliver the price thereof. 
Instead of carrying out the contract Bantog fraudulently disposed Of said jewels 
for her own profit and advantage and to the prejudice of the aggrieved party by 
pawning theni in the pawnshops of Antonio Matute &amp; Co., Geronimo Sanchez, 
Guillermo F. Ruiz, and Fausto 0. Raymundo, as appears from the pawn tickets Nos. 
49427 and 49297 of Matute'.s pawnshop; No. 28402 of Raymundo's; No. 12497 of 
Ruiz'; and No. 5128 of that of Geronimo A. Sanchez.
<p>Upon arraignment the accused pleaded guilty and the court upon the merits of 
the case sentenced her to the penalty of four months and one day of <em>arresto 
mayor,</em> to pay an indemnity of P400 to the injured party, and in case of 
insolvency to the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment, provided that the 
latter should not exceed a third of the principal penalty, and the payment of 
the costs. The accused did not appeal and on November 19, 1913, began to serve 
her sentence.</p>
<p>By a written motion of November 20, of the same year, counsel for the injured 
party, the owner of the said jewels, petitioned that, in accordance with the 
provisions of article 120 of the Penal Code, the owners of the four pawnshops 
mentioned be directed to restore the jewels described in the petition without 
any indemnity on the part of the petitioner.</p>
<p>The said pawnbrokers, Antonio Matute, Geronimo Sanchez, Guillermo F. Ruiz, 
and Fausto 0. Raymundo, were notified and summoned to appear at the hearing of 
the motion at 8 o'clock a. m. on November 26,1913, and, as none of them 
appeared, the court by order of the same date directed that they deliver to 
Quintina Reyes, without indemnity on her part, the jewels specified in said 
order. When the pawn-brokers had been informed of this decision, Geronimo 
Sanchez, according to the statement of counsel for the offended party, returned 
to her the jewels referred to in pawn ticket No. 5128, but counsel for Guillermo 
F. Ruiz, Fausto 0. Raymundo, and Antonio Matute appealed to this court and in 
their brief asked that the said order be set aside with the costs against the 
appellee, alleging that the lower court erred in ordering restitution of the 
jewels in question without due indemnification; that it also erred in accepting 
as a fact that said jewels were pawned in their shops, without the corresponding 
pawn tickets having been exhibited as proof; and, finally, that it erred in 
ordering restitution of the jewels without due process of law.</p>
<p>It is beyond dispute that the jewels referred to in the pawn tickets issued 
by the pawnshops of Guillermo F. Ruiz, Fausto 0. Raymundo, and Antonio Matute, 
which were the subject matter of the estafa committed by the accused and 
convicted party, Marcelina Bantog, were the property of Quintina Reyes, who 
delivered them to Bantog for sale, with the obligation of returning them if they 
were not sold; but the latter, acting in bad faith, converted and disposed of 
said jewels by pawning them with the appellants, without the knowledge of their 
lawful owner and to her prejudice; and, moreover, the perpetrator of the estafa 
kept the money received from pawning the jewels.</p>
<p>Among the civil responsibilities incurred by a person committing estafa there 
appears in the first place, according to article 119 of the Penal Code, that of 
restoring the thing taken. </p>
<p>Article 120 of the same Code says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The restitution of the thing itself must be made, if possible, with payment 
for deterioration or diminution of value to be appraised by the court.</p>
<p>"Restitution shall be made, even though the thing may be in the possession of 
a third person, who had acquired it in a legal manner, reserving, however, his 
action against the proper person.</p>
<p>"This provision is not applicable to a case in which the third person has 
acquired the thing in the manner and with the requisites established by law to 
make it unrecoverable."</p></blockquote>
<p>According to the text of the foregoing article the jewels were not acquired 
by the appellants in the manner and with the legal requisites that would make 
them unrecoverable under the provisions of article 464 of the Civil Code. The 
jewels were pawned without the consent of their owner, to her fraud and 
prejudice, and must be restored by the appellants even though they acquired them 
under a legal contract and notwithstanding the fact that they are third parties 
with respect to the agreement between the owner of the jewels and the accused, 
for they are under a definite obligation to restore them to their owner without 
any obligation on her part to make good the amount for which they were pawned, 
and for which the three appellants can make demand upon the accused who 
appropriated them to her own benefit.</p>
<p>The provision of law is positive and there is no sound reason for failure on 
the part of the appellants to obey it, and it has always been thus observed in 
various similar cases decided by this court, as may be seen in the decisions in 
the cases of Varela <em>vs.</em> Matute (9 Phil. Rep., 479) and Varela 
<em>vs.</em> Finnick (9 Phil. Rep., 482).</p>
<p>It is to be noted that when the appellants were summoned in due form to the 
hearing upon the motion presented by the appellee, who was entering claim for 
the jewels, not only did they not allege any reason against the claim of the 
owner of the jewels, but they did not even appear in the court when the hearing 
took place.</p>
<p>The indemnity ordered in the judgment is understood in the case that 
restitution of the jewels would be impossible, as the order established for 
making effective the responsibility under article 119 of the Code is: first, 
restitution; second, reparation for the injury; and third, indemnity. </p>
<p>For the foregoing reasons, whereby the errors assigned to the order appealed 
from are deemed to have been refuted, it is proper to affirm the order, as we 
hereby do, with the costs in equal parts against the appellants.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Johnson, Carson, Moreland,</em> and <em>Araullo, 
JJ.,</em> concur.<br></p></div>
