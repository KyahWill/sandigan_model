				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This defendant was charged with a violation of the Opium Law.&nbsp;&nbsp; The complaint alleged "that on or about&nbsp; December 24, 1913, within the&nbsp; municipal&nbsp; limits of the municipality of Cebu, of&nbsp; this province and&nbsp; judicial district,&nbsp; the said Go Seng, being in no manner authorized by law, did willfully, unlawfully, and criminally smoke, chew, swallow, and inhale opium, thus incurring the risk of becoming&nbsp; a recidivist; with violation of the law."<br><br>After&nbsp; hearing the evidence, the Honorable Cayetano Lukban, auxiliary judge of the Court of First Instance of the Twentieth District, found the defendant guilty of the&nbsp; crime charged&nbsp; and sentenced him to pay a fine of P350&nbsp; and costs, and to suffer subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency.<br><br>From&nbsp; that sentence the defendant appealed to this court. A question of fact only is presented by the appellant.<br><br>From&nbsp; an examination&nbsp; of the&nbsp; evidence, we find that two witnesses, whose credibility has not&nbsp; been impeached in the slightest degree, swore&nbsp; positively that they caught the defendant in the act of smoking&nbsp; opium.&nbsp; The pipe used and the opium which was found in the possession of the accused were&nbsp; presented as proof during the&nbsp; trial of the cause. In addition to that proof, we find&nbsp; from an exhibit&nbsp; presented during the trial of the cause that the defendant had heretofore been accused and&nbsp; found guilty of a violation of the Opium Law, and had been sentenced, on the 29th day of September, 1910, to pay a fine of P350.<br><br>The Attorney-General, in view of the fact that the defendant had been once before convicted&nbsp; of the same crime, recommends that the sentence of the lower court be modified, and that in addition to the fine imposed by the lower court, a&nbsp; sentence of imprisonment for a period of&nbsp; three months be also imposed.<br><br>With that recommendation we are inclined to agree.&nbsp; We think,&nbsp; in view of the fact that the defendant has been found guilty&nbsp; of a violation of the Opium Law twice, that the penalty to be imposed for the second offense should be more severe than that which was imposed for&nbsp; the first offense. (See U. S. <i>vs.</i>. Lim Sing, 23 Phil. Rep., 424.)<br><br>Therefore, the sentence of the lower court is hereby modified and it is hereby ordered and decreed that the defendant be sentenced to be imprisoned&nbsp; for&nbsp; a period of&nbsp; three months and to pay a fine of P350 and the costs, and in case of insolvency to suffer subsidiary imprisonment in accordance with the provisions of the law.&nbsp; So&nbsp; ordered.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Arellano, C.
