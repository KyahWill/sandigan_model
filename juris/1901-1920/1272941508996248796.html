				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Narciso Marigsa, as the administrator of the intestate estate of Esteban Marigsa,&nbsp; demands from Ildefonsa Macabuntoc,&nbsp; the widow&nbsp; of&nbsp; the said Esteban Marigsa,&nbsp; certain property for administration, on the ground that it belonged exclusively to the deceased.<br><br>The property specified in&nbsp; the&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; consists of&nbsp; six carabaos, which, on the death of Esteban&nbsp; Marigsa, were sold by his widow - two, to Anatalia Isidro,&nbsp; for P120 each; one, to Agapito Mercado, for P150; one, to Agustin Deliso, also for P150; one, to Sabas&nbsp; Doro, for the same price; and the other, to Gaspar Umipig, for P120.<br><br>The plaintiff endeavored to&nbsp; prove the&nbsp; alleged exclusive ownership of Esteban Marigsa, by means of the certificates of transfer issued in the municipality of Cuyapo, Province of Nueva Ecija, which read:<br><blockquote>"Record of transfer of large cattle. - Province of Nueva Ecija. - Municipality&nbsp; of&nbsp; Cuyapo. - July&nbsp; 12,&nbsp; 1906. - This record&nbsp; certifies that Mr. Esteban Marigsa&nbsp; (deceased), represented by his wife,&nbsp; Ildefonsa&nbsp; Macabuntoc, a resident&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; as owner, transferred by&nbsp; sale&nbsp; to&nbsp; X., a resident&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; as purchaser, for the sum of one hundred and&nbsp; twenty pesos&nbsp; (P120),&nbsp; one carabao cow, the&nbsp; description of which,&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *."</blockquote>The defendants attempted to prove that the carabaos belonged exclusively to the widow&nbsp; as paraphernal property brought on her second marriage&nbsp; to&nbsp; her husband,&nbsp; Esteban Marigsa, whom she married&nbsp; thirty years before, and that the husband&nbsp; brought&nbsp; nothing to&nbsp; the conjugal partnership. These&nbsp; facts were averred by&nbsp; the widow and two other witnesses.&nbsp; The widow&nbsp; moreover testified that there was no issue by her marriage with Marigsa,&nbsp; and that she&nbsp; no longer had any ascendants, nor knew of any&nbsp; collateral relative of her deceased husband; that the plaintiff himself was named Marigsa only&nbsp; as a nickname,&nbsp; his father's family name being Magcauayan, and that the&nbsp; carabaos had been registered in the name&nbsp; of Esteban Marigsa because the latter was her husband.<br><br>The Court of First Instance&nbsp; of Nueva Ecija, in accordance with the petition appearing in the complaint, declared that&nbsp; the six animals specified therein belonged&nbsp; exclusively to the intestate estate of Esteban Marigsa and were subject to the plaintiff's administration, and ordered the defendants to return them to Narciso Marigsa as such administrator. The court also declared rescinded and&nbsp; invalid the&nbsp; sales made by the defendant, Ildefonsa Macabuntoc, to her codefendants, with one-sixth of the costs of the trial against each of the defendants.&nbsp; The latter appealed from the said judgment and alleged the following assignments of error:<br><br>First. That the court found that the plaintiff had&nbsp; fully proved the allegations of his complaint&nbsp; by means&nbsp; of the certificates&nbsp; of ownership issued by&nbsp; the municipality&nbsp; of Cuyapo.<br><br>Second. That the court found that the carabaos sued for belonged&nbsp; exclusively&nbsp; to&nbsp; the intestate Esteban Marigsa, formed a part of his estate&nbsp; under administration, and adudged their return to the defendants; and<br><br>Third. That the court declared the sales made by the defendant, Ildefonsa Macabuntoc, to her codefendants to be rescinded and invalid.<br><br>This court has already decided that the initiation of intestate proceedings must not disturb the&nbsp; possession, either of the surviving&nbsp; spouse, or&nbsp; of the legitimate&nbsp; heirs, much less that of a third party.<br><br>In the registration of animals belonging to husband and wife, the record thereof is often made&nbsp; out only in the name of the husband, on account&nbsp; of his being the administrator of the conjugal partnership;&nbsp; so that the registration herein concerned is not conclusive evidence of the exclusive ownership of the husband.&nbsp;&nbsp; Other kind of proof&nbsp; is necessary to destroy the presumption implied by&nbsp; article 1407 of the Civil Code, which&nbsp; provides;<br><blockquote>"All the property of the marriage shall be considered&nbsp; as partnership property until it is proven that it belongs exclusively to the husband or to the wife."<br></blockquote>Although the property appears as registered&nbsp; in the name of the&nbsp; husband, if it was acquired for a valuable consideration during the marriage it&nbsp; has&nbsp; the inherent character&nbsp; of partnership property, whether the acquisition&nbsp; is made for the partnership or for one of the spouses only.&nbsp; (Art. 1401, par. 1, Civil Code.)<br><br>The marriage of Marigsa with Macabuntoc having lasted for more than thirty years, according to the testimony, and some of the&nbsp; carabaos being the offspring of others which were purchased, as stated&nbsp; by the defendant, during&nbsp; the marriage, such animals are not paraphernal property of the widow, as she claims, for even such offspring is considered as community&nbsp; property, according to paragraph&nbsp; 3 of&nbsp; the said article 1401; nor were they the private property of the deceased husband.<br><br>The community property of the marriage, at the dissolution of this bond by the death of one of the spouses, ceases to belong to the legal partnership and becomes the property of a&nbsp; community, by operation&nbsp; of law, between the&nbsp; surviving spouse and the heirs of the deceased Espouse, or the exclusive property of the widower or the widow if he or she be&nbsp; the heir of the deceased spouse.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the present suit, no proof was adduced to show what right the plaintiff has to call himself coowner with the defendant widow, the only action which could appertain to him&nbsp; in order that he might interfere with the acts of a person who, in the exercise of her rights with respect to property of which she is a coowner, or perhaps an absolute owner, disposed of such property by transferring&nbsp; the&nbsp; same, without the need therefor of&nbsp; any authorization whatever.&nbsp; Although it were&nbsp; upon no other basis than that of coownership, which coownership is irrefutably shown to have existed by the&nbsp; evidence in this case, the surviving widow&nbsp; acted perfectly&nbsp; within&nbsp; her&nbsp; rights in transferring the property in question.&nbsp; Whenever&nbsp; it shall be shown that there is another coowner as the hem of the deceased husband, then there will&nbsp; be occasion to prosecute an action for the annulment&nbsp; of the sale with respect to one-half of&nbsp; the said property; in&nbsp; order that it may be inventoried as belonging to the testate or intestate succession of the predecessor in interest.<br><blockquote>"ART.&nbsp; 399. Every coowner shall have full&nbsp; ownership of his part and in the fruits and benefits derived therefrom, and he therefore may alienate, assign, or mortgage it, and even substitute another&nbsp; person&nbsp; in its&nbsp; enjoyment, unless personal rights are in question.&nbsp; But the effect of the alienation or mortgage, with regard to the coowners, shall be limited to the share which may be awarded him in the division on&nbsp; the dissolution&nbsp; of&nbsp; the community."&nbsp; (Civil Code.)<br><br>"SEC. 685. <i>Community Property.</i> - One-half the&nbsp; community property,&nbsp; as determined by the law in force in the Philippine Islands before the thirteenth&nbsp; day of&nbsp; August, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, belonging to a husband and wife, shall be deemed to belong to the deceased husband or wife, and shall be inventoried&nbsp; and accounted for, and distributed as a part of the estate, in the same manner as all other property belonging to the estate."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Code of Civil Procedure.)</blockquote>From the preceding premises it is concluded:<br><br>First. That sufficient grounds&nbsp; have not been&nbsp; shown in this&nbsp; suit to adjudge that the property in question was the private property of the deceased spouse, as against the legal presumption&nbsp; that it was&nbsp; the&nbsp; community property&nbsp; of both spouses; and, consequently, the first part&nbsp; of the first finding of the judgment appealed from, declaring it to be&nbsp; such,&nbsp; is improper and should be reversed.<br><br>Second. That the second finding&nbsp; of the said judgment&nbsp; is premature, in so far as it declares the sales made by the defendant, Ildefonsa Macabuntoc, to be&nbsp; rescinded&nbsp; and invalid, as this could be done only after it had been proven, in a proper action, that there is another coowner as heir of the deceased husband&nbsp; of the vendor;&nbsp; and,&nbsp; consequently, this finding also should be reversed.<br><br>Third. That the second part of the first finding, in so far as it declares all the animals&nbsp; claimed to be subject to the intestate estate of Esteban Marigsa, is likewise improper, inasmuch&nbsp; as, by virtue of the legal presumption that has until now prevailed,&nbsp; only a one-half&nbsp; interest that might have pertained to the deceased husband in the said property, presumptively the&nbsp; community&nbsp; property of the dissolved marriage, can, in&nbsp; principle, be considered as subject thereto, until proof to the contrary be adduced.&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently, this finding must also&nbsp; be disapproved.<br><br>The judgment appealed from is reversed, without&nbsp; special finding as to costs.<br><br><i>Torres, Johnson,&nbsp; Carson, </i>and <i>Moreland, JJ.</i>, concur.<br></div>
