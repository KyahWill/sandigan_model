				<H3>THE BISHOP OF CEBU, REPRESENTING THE ROMAN CATHOLIC  CHURCH, PLAINTIFF AND  APPELLEE,  VS.  MARIANO MANGABON,  DEFENDANT  AND  APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The complaint  in  this case relates to a tract of land in the district of  Ermita of this city, which  it is alleged is at present occupied by the defendant.  The  object of the original complaint was to recover the possession of the said land, while in the amended complaint the  plaintiff prays that the said land be declared to be the property of the  Catholic Church and that it  be restored to the latter.  Counsel  for  appellant admits in his brief that the object of the action is the recovery of possession when he refers to the judgment of the court below as being "in favor of the plaintiff in an <em>action to recove</em>r the possession of certain real estate."  (Record, p. 1.)</p>
<p>Neither party has exhibited any title papers to the land in question nor any other documentary proof.  They have only offered certain parol evidence as to the former possession  of the land and as to certain acts of ownership exercised by the parties over the same.</p>
<p>The court  below  found  (<em>a</em>)  "that  the  defendant's parents and brothers had been in possession of the land in question until about the year 1877;" (<em>b</em>)  "that it had not been clearly shown in what capacity they had occupied the lands;" (<em>c</em>) "that,about the year 1878 the defendant and his relatives vacated the land by virtue of an  order from the municipality,  which declared that the land  was included within the zone of <em>materiales fuertes</em> (fire zone) and the houses in which they lived upon the said land were of light materials, and that they so vacated the land without objection;" (<em>d</em>) "that after the land was vacated the parish priests of the Ermita Church fenced the land and cleaned the same without any objection whatsoever on  the part of anyone; that the plaintiff claimed that this  property had  belonged to  the Catholic Church  from time  immemorial, the defendant, his parents and brothers having occupied a part thereof by the mere tolerance of the  Catholic Church;" (<em>e</em>) "that in the year 1898 the defendant, without the consent of anyone, entered upon the land in question and built thereon a nipa house and continued to live thereon without the consent of the parish priest of the  Ermita Church or the  plaintiff in this case."   (Bill of exceptions, p. 11.)   The court then "that the defendants vacate the land described in the complaint and pay the costs of this action"  (p. 12).</p>
<p>Counsel for appellant  says in his brief "that the defendant  claims to be the owner of the  land by inheritance." (Brief, p. 8.)   It is not necessary for this court to apply to the present case the well-settled doctrine that it  is not sufficient to allege a universal title of inheritance without showing the manner and form in which such title was converted into a singular title in favor of the person invoking the same, particularly where, as in the present case, the question involved does not relate to the ownership  of the property but rather to who has the better right to the possession of the same.  But the court below suggests that there are several brothers of the defendant who might also claim the same right to occupy the land but who, however, have not done  so.  The court says "from the evidence introduced at the trial and from the fact that the defendant's brothers d6 not claim any right to the land in question, it seems that the claim of the plaintiff is the more credible."  (Bill of exceptions, p. 11.)</p>
<p>The complaint  is directed against the  illegal act of spoliation committed by the defendant, in October,  1898, while as he himself says there was no  priest in Ermita who could take care of the church and of the land in question,  the American troops having  occupied the parish house according to  the defendant,  and the Filipino troops having  occupied it according  to  other witnesses.   This is one of the points as to  which there is no dispute between the  parties,  the defendant  and  the  witnesses of  both parties  agreeing in the main  as well  as upon all  the important details relating to this matter.</p>
<p>Counsel for appellant sums up hm brief in the following paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The defendant was  the  legal  owner of the property when he was unlawfully ejected by the plaintiff in  1879, and we insist that he had a right to reenter upon the land when  he did so, the time  for prescription not  having expired since he was ejected in 1879" (p. 8).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon this point the court below said:  "The occupation of the land by the defendant in the year  1898 was illegal, for, if he thought he had a right  to the land,  he should have, applied to the courts for the possession of what belonged  to him, and not proceed to  occupy property claimed  (he  should have said possessed)  by  another against the will of the latter."</p>
<p>This conclusion of law of the trial court is entirely in conformity  with the provisions of article 441 of the Civil Code.  Any other conclusion would sanction the recovery of  possession through  violence or other unlawful and arbitrary means, and would permit a person to take the law into his own hands:  "If a person thinks that he is entitled to the property which another possesses  he  should claim the same from the person in possession.   If the latter accedes and voluntarily returns possession and acknowledges that the property does  not belong to him,  there  is no necessity of any one interfering, but if the person in possession refuses to deliver the property, the one who believe^ himself to be entitled to it, however well founded his belief may be, can not take the law into his own hands but must seek the aid of  the competent authorites."  (4 Manresa, Commentaries on the Civil Code, p. 163.)  The action of the defendant in 1898 was therefore absolutely unlawful.</p>
<p>This possession held by the  defendant  in 1898 can  not be added to the  former possession,  which  was interrupted in 1877 by the order of the municipality, so as to consider such possession continuous, the time intervening not being of sufficient duration  to cover the  statutory  period  of prescription.  Article 466 of the Civil Code provides that "a person who recovers possession <em>according to law</em>, which was improperly lost, is considered as having enjoyed it without  interruption for  all  the  purposes which may redound to his benefit."   But in this case it appears (1) that it can not be affirmed that the possession enjoyed by the defendant was improperly lost; that possession ceased by virtue of an order from the municipality and no proof to the contrary has been offered on this point; (2) that it is impossible to say what was the nature of the possession prior to the year 1877—that  is to say, whether it was held by right or by the mere tolerance of the plaintiff in  this case.  The code refers to the recovery of the possession, according to tow?,'which was improperly  lost, and to  "recover according to law means through the proper writs and actions, or by requesting the aid of the competent authorities in the special cases where the provisions of article 441 may  apply."   (4 Manresa,  Commentaries  on the Civil Code, p. 329.)  "Of course," continues Manresa "the  acts of violence or secrecy or mere tolerance can  not affect the right of possession."   Consequently the defendant in  this case could never have lawfully and legally done  what he did, to wit, to reenter  upon  the  land from which he  had been ejected by the  city  of  Manila.   If the order of the municipality was illegal, and the possession was  improperly lost, the  defendant should  have requested the assistance of  the competent authorities to recover it.  He should  have applied to  the executive or administrative officials, as  the case might have  been, or to  the courts of justice in a plenary action for possession, for  a year having elapsed since he  was ejected from the premises, he could not maintain a summary action for possession.</p>
<p>The legal provisions  hereinbefore quoted would be  sufficient ground upon which to base the confirmation of the decision of  the trial court,  but  on account of the facts involved in this case a question of law has been raised by the members of this court which has not been urged by the parties themselves.  It is absolutely necessary to decide this question, which naturally arises from the facts alleged in the complaint.  The  question is whether, after  the promulgation of the Civil Code, the  <em>accion publiciana</em>, which had for its object the recovery of possession in a  plenary action before an action for the recovery of title could be instituted, still existed.  It is well known that under the legislation prior to the Civil Code, both  substantive and adjective, there were three remedies which a  party unlawfully dispossessed could avail  himself of, to wit: The <em>accion interdictal</em>, which could be brought within a year, in a summary proceeding; the plenary action for possession in an ordinary proceeding, which could only be brought after the expiration of a year; and the  action for title in an ordinary proceeding, which was brought in case the plenary action for possession  failed.   The <em>accion interdictal</em> had for its object the recovery of the  physical possession; the plenary  action for possession, the  better right to such possession ;  and the  action for title, the  <em>recovery of the ownership</em>.</p>
<p>We lay down as a conclusion that if the plaintiff, when he was deprived in October, 1898, of the possession which he had enjoyed quietly and peacefully  for twenty years, more or  less, had within a year instituted the <em>accion interdictal</em>, or summary action for possession, he would  have been, necessarily and undoubtedly, restored to the possession of the land.  It would  have availed  the  defendant nothing  to allege, as he now alleges,  that he had merely recovered the possession which he  improperly lost in 1877, when he  dispossessed the plaintiff as he did.  Any tribunal, in the same arbitrary  manner in which the defendant dispossessed the party in possession, would have condemned the said defendant to return the possession to that party.</p>
<p>But a year elapsed  and the plaintiff brought this  summary action for possession, and  we also lay down  as a conclusion that such summary action for possession could not be maintained, either  under  the old Code  of Civil Procedure or under the new  Code of Procedure  in Civil Actions.   (Laws 1 and 2, title 34  of the  <em>Novisima Recopilacion</em>; art. 1635 of the  Spanish Code of Civil Procedure and sec. 80  of  the present Code of  Procedure  in Civil Actions.)</p>
<p>This quiet and peaceful possession of twenty years, more or less, thus lost in a moment, could not be recovered in a  summary action for possession  after  the expiration of one year, but possession could still be recovered  through the <em>accion publiciana</em>,  which involved the right to possess. This latter action would be  then based upon the fact that he, having been in possession for  twenty years,  could not lose the same until he had been given an  opportunity to be heard and had been defeated in an action in court by another with a better right  (The same laws.)   This fact of itself would have been sufficient to recover the possession, not in a summary, but in a plenary action, in which it would likewise have availed the defendant nothing to allege that all that he did was to  recover a possession improperly lost in 1877.   In one way or the other the plaintiff would have recovered such possession, in the first case the physical possession and in  the second  case the right to possess, which is not lost by the mere occupation of a third person, whether such occupation was effected violently, secretly, or arbitrarily.</p>
<p>But the doubt which now exists is whether, after the promulgation of the Civil Code, the  <em>accion publiciana</em> continued to exist.</p>
<p>The doubt arises from  the provisions of article 460 of the Civil Code,  which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The possessor may lose his possession—</p>
  <p>"1. By the abandonment  of the thing.</p>
  <p>"2. By transfer to  another for  a  good or valuable consideration.</p>
  <p>"3. By the destruction  or total loss of the thing or by the thing becoming unmarketable.</p>
  <p>"4. By the possession of  another, even against the will of the former possessor, if  the new possession  has lasted more than one year."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last provision  of this article has given rise to the doubt whether possession which is lost by the occupation of another against the will of  the former possessor is merely possession <span style="font-style: italic;">de  facto</span> or possession <span style="font-style: italic;">de jure</span>.</p>
<p>The most  powerful reason why  it is thought  that it refers to possession both <em>de facto</em> and de jure is  that, whereas the two are equally lost in  the manner indicated in the first three provisions of this article, it would be rather strange that the fourth provision  should only refer to possession <em>de facto</em>.</p>
<p>This, however, is not convincing  because not only can the right of possession of any kind be lost in the aforesaid three ways, but  the right  of ownership as  well.  It could not be inferred from this, however, that the right of ownership can be lost in the fourth  manner  indicated.  The legislation  and  the  jurisprudence of all countries  will allow a party after he has  lost possession to bring an action to recover the ownership of the property—that is to say, to recover what belongs to him—except where he is barred by the statute of limitations.  There is no law fixing one year and one day as the period of prescription of such actions.</p>
<p>Manresa expressly propounds this question and says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Meditation  upon the nature of possession, being  convinced as we are of the fact that possession constitutes a right, a  right  <em>in rem</em>,  whenever it is  exercised over real  property or property rights, has merely served to strengthen as far as possible our conviction of the existence of  the <em>accion publiciana</em>.   We confess, willing to rely only upon a sound basis, that a doubt has occurred to us as to whether or not such action should be exercised by the possessor, as we find nothing definite upon which to place such reliance, although we have noticed that most of the authors admit  that he should, and we know that where there is a right there is a cause of action.</p>
  <p>"We have later seen this question  raised and the proposition advanced that although,  as  an exception to the general rule, such action is  based upon  equity,  but as equity is not sufficient to allow the exercise of it such action, it would be necessary to have a legal provision, an article in the code, establishing the  same,  a provision  and  an article which do not exist, and their nonexistence shows that there is no such thing as the <em>accion publiciana</em>.</p>
  <p>"That we have no knowledge of the existence of any legal text or recent provisions which expressly relate  to such action, is true   The same thing is true in France.  However, the majority  of the authors admit its existence. Among us its existence is  also generally admitted by the authorities on civil and procedural law.   But we do  not desire to base our conclusions upon the arguments of the authorities, particularly when we  note that Sanchez  Roman is the only one who has attempted to support in any way his  conclusions.  It is sufficient, says this  author, that the right existing, there,should be an action to protect it.  There is no necessity of any special declaration in the Civil Code.</p>
  <p>"We are of the same opinion as the author in question, but certainly not because we believe that if the possessor is deprived of the <em>accion publiciana</em> his right ceases to be a right <em>in rem</em>.   In regard to this matter we refer to what we have already said in our preliminary consideration of the question  of possession.</p>
  <p>"In regard to this matter  the idea is present in the code that  possession should be considered as an actual right and it is  so stated  in various articles of that code,  as for instance in article 438.   It  would be impossible to  admit that a mere physical act would confer all the rights  which a possessor ordinarily enjoys.</p>
  <p>"Article 445  presupposes that possession may be considered either as <em>de facto</em> or <em>de jure</em>, for when it refers to controversies arising from  the possession  <span style="font-style: italic;">de  facto</span>,  it clearly indicates that other controversies may arise  which would not relate to the possession <em>de facto</em>.   Further it can not be conceived that had its intent been different it should have preferred actual possession to any other possession.   The article in question ends with the following significant words: 'The thing shall be placed in deposit or judicial keeping until the <em>possession</em> or ownership  there of is decided in the proper manner.'   That is to say, the question of fact can not be determined until the question of law has been decided either in regard to the ownership or in regard to  the  possession (pp.  220-221).</p>
  <p>"Further, let  us take another subject, for instance, the subject of easements.  It was  generally, believed that the <em>accion confesoria</em> existed.   Vain delusion!  We have carefully examined all the provisions of the code relating to easements and we find absolutely  nothing in regard to such  an action.  Then the  <em>accion  confesoria</em> is another error.   It does  not  really exist.  Then, if the owner of the dominant estate is denied the use of the easement,  it would not be because he has not a right to  such use of it The only  thing that he has not is the action.</p>
  <p>"No;  such  an absurdity can not be admitted.   It is impossible to conceive that a person has a right which need not be respected by others, and  such  respect can not be exacted unless the law provides  an adequate remedy for its enforcement.  If a person has a right over any kind of property, such right would not be complete unless it could be enforced as against the whole  world.   The action is the recognition of the right; it is the weapon for its protection ; the right certainly does not arise from the action, but on  the contrary  the  action  arises from the right. There  is a right recognized by the  code—then this  is sufficient!  That right necessarily carries  with it the action to enforce it, the life-giving  force.  The action is, under this aspect, the actual enforcement of the right, and these  two things are so closely allied that if the action is denied the right is also virtually and actually denied The <span style="font-style: italic;">accion publiciana,</span> therefore, exists, not for  the sake of equity, but because it must necessarily exist if the right to possession exists or can exist as provided in article 445, and as is inferred from the other articles of the code dealing with this subject.</p>
  <p>"There are not, in reality, any  practical  difficulties, for the courts consider as owners many who are simply possessors, and actions for title  are maintained upon  evidence which  appears to be  proof of  ownership, but which in reality is not, for the reason that the title under which such ownership is claimed is not always in question, but merely its superiority over the claim of title of another.  In a word,  it is necessary to state the  nature of the action but not the name by which it is known, and the claim being a just one, it is allowed in an action for title which in a multitude of cases would be nothing but an <em>accion publiciana</em> (plenary action for possession).   Do  not  give the name of the action because it is not necessary; merely ask that the right be enforced.  Who can  reject the claim?" (Pages 223-224.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paragraph 4 of article 460 is not an innovation in the Civil Code, nor does it mean  the modification or reformation of the old law.  Law 17, title 30 of the third <em>Partida</em> contains the same provision: "One who  holds property can not lose the possession thereof except in one of the following manners: (1) If he is ejected from it by force;  (2) if another person occupies.it while he is absent and upon his return refuses him admission.   *  *  *  But although he may lose the possession in either of the aforesaid manners, he can, however, recover the same, and even the title thereto by an action in court."  There is no doubt that paragraph 4 of article 460 is nothing but a repetition of the law in force prior to the Civil Code.  He who loses possession in either of these ways may demand the return  of the same in an action in court, as well as the ownership of the property, the glossator in expounding, the word <span style="font-style: italic;">juizio </span>which appears in the law, saying, "by means of an action, <em>unde vi</em> namely, that of recovery, or by any such <em>restorative means</em>."  So that the possession thus lost may be recovered not only in an  action <em>unde vi</em> but by some other restorative means, such as the <em>accion publiciana</em> or a penal action; this aside from an action for title.</p>
<p>Law 2, title 34, book 11 of the <em>"Novisima Recoplacion"</em> contains in its title the following prohibitive provision: "No one shall be deprived of his  possession until he has had an opportunity to be heard and his right is  defeated in accordance with the law."</p>
<p>As  a legal precedent to  paragraph 4 of  article 460 we have law 3, title 8, of the same book 11, which says:  "The laws of some cities provide that he who has been in possession of a building,  vineyard, or other land for one year and one day, peacefully and adversely to the person claiming to be entitled to such possession who  travels in and out of the village, shall not be held responsible therefor. There being doubt as to whether  such possession for the period of one year and one day requires title in good faith, we, to dispell this doubt, do hereby order that he who holds such possession for the period of one year and  one day <em>shall not be exempt from liability therefor while in possession</em> unless such possession of one year and one  day was accompanied by <em>title in good faith."</em></p>
<p>If the whole provision of article 460, paragraph, was contained in the old law and such was the meaning and efficacy that that possession of one year and one  day had under the said old law, the courts must give  some satisfactory and  convincing explanation  why  the  meaning  and efficacy of such possession of one year and one day referred to in the code should be different.  We are unable to give such explanation, because in the act which was the basis pf the present code nothing new was provided upon this subject, nor was any rule or procedure specified by which the various sections of the new law should be governed.  Therefore the provisions of the code should be construed, as to the possession of one year and one day,  as they were construed in the prior Iegislati6n, unless it appears that the intention of the legislature  was otherwise—that is to say, unless it appears that the said legislature intended exactly the contrary of what had been established preceding the enactment of the code.</p>
<p>The right acquired by the person who has been in possession for one year and one day is the right that the former possessor lost by  allowing  the year and  one  day to expire.   The right is lost by the prescription of the  action. And the action which prescribes upon the expiration of the year  is "the action to recover or to retain <em>possession</em>;" that is to say, the interdictory action.  (Art. 1968, par 1.) Then the only right that  can be acquired now, as  before, by the person  who was in  possession for one year and one day is that he can not be made to answer in an interdictory action, but this  is  not  so in  a  plenary  action unless he had some title in good faith.   The former possessor who had been in possession for twenty years, more or less, was considered as owner, and unless he was given an opportunity to be heard, and was defeated in law, he could not be deprived of such possession; and notwithstanding all this, and in spite of such prohibition, the maintenance of a possession wrongfully taken from the former possessor by a willful act of the actual possessor had to be sustained.</p>
<p>The lessee, the depositary, the pledgee, the intruder, the usurper, the  thief himself, after the expiration of  a year would not  be responsible for the possession of which the lawful possessor was wrongfully deprived, and if the latter could produce no evidence of his right of ownership—the only  thing that he could do according to the contrary theory—it  would be  impossible for him to  recover such possession thus lost by any other means.</p>
<p>If, in addition to the fact of possession, the action for the enforcement of which prescribes after the expiration of one year and one day, there exists without any doubt what-soever the right to possess  (or more properly speaking in the case at bar, to continue to possess), which said right of possession would be a  right in rent, such  possession would not be on a less favorable footing than a mere possession <em>de facto</em>; and, if in the latter case the interdictory action lies, the action which existed prior to the enactment of the code, to wit, the <em>accion, publiciana</em>, should continue to lie in the former case.   The code establishes rights and the Law of Civil Procedure prescribes actions for the protection of such rights, and  we can not look to the code to find any  provision defining the  action which every  civil right carries with it.</p>
<p>This is the reason why as a title of chapter 3 of the code in which article 460 is included, and as a sanction of the whole of title 5, book 2, which deals with possession, article 446  provides  that every  possessor  has a right to be respected  in  his possession, and  should  he be  disturbed therein, he must be protected or possession must be restored to him by the means <em>established in the laws of procedure.</em></p>
<p>The code refers to the laws of procedure enacted in Spain in 1881 and extended to the Philippines in 1888.  Article 1635 of the old Code of Civil Procedure makes provision for summary proceedings to retain or to recover, to protect or to restore, possession, provided the action is brought within a year, but after the expiration of this period the party may bring <em>such action as may be proper</em>.  This latter action, as has been explained before, may be either the plenary action for possession referred to or an action for title.  This assumed, and reading article 1635 of the old Code of Civil Procedure immediately before article 446 of the Civil Code, we are unable to conceive how that could be successfully denied after the 8th of December 1889, when the  Civil Code went into effect, which could not be denied prior to that date, to wit, the existence of the <em>accion, publiciana</em> to recover the right of possession, to enforce the  right to possess, which although it could not be brought  within the year as a mere interdictory action for the protection of the mere physical possession, there can be no valid reason why it could not  be brought  after the expiration of the  year in order  to protect the right and not  the mere  physical possession.</p>
<p>Article 1635 of the old  Code of Civil Procedure not having been repealed by the Civil Code, if the <em>accion publiciana</em> existed prior to its enactment,  it must necessarily exist after such enactment.  We  consequently  conclude  that the action brought by the plaintiff in this case to recover the possession of which he was unlawfully deprived by the defendant can be properly maintained under the provisions of the present Civil Code considered as a substantive law, without prejudice to any right which he  may have to the ownership of the property, which ownership he must necessarily establish in  order  to  overcome the presumption of title which exists in favor of the lawful possessor, the plaintiff in this case, who had been in the quiet and  peaceful possession of the land for twenty years, more or less, at the time he was wrongfully dispossessed by the defendant.</p>
<p>Having reached  this conclusion,  the judgment of the court below is accordingly affirmed,  with the costs of this action against the appellant.  So ordered.</p>
