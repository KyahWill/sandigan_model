				<H3>BENITO POBLETE, PETITIONER, VS. THE COURT OP FIRST INSTANCE OF CAVITE ET AL., RESPONDENTS.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MORELAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an action for a writ of mandamus to compel the Court of First 
Instance of the Province of Cavite to take cognizance of and continue an 
election contest pending in that court between the petitioner here, Benito 
Poblete, and several respondents.
<p>It appears that, in the elections held on the 6th of June 1916, Elias 
Poblete, one of the defendants in this action, was duly declared elected to the 
office of municipal president of Naic, Cavite. Benito Poblete, the plaintiff 
here, contested the election of Elias Poblete. After the beginning of the 
proceeding a motion was made to dismiss the same on the ground that the 
contestant had not notified one Francisco Punzalan, one of the persons who 
received votes for the office contested. It appears also that the fact that 
Punsalan received votes for the office contested was not disclosed until after 
the opening of the ballot boxes after the proceedings had been instituted and 
the hearing begun. The proclamation of the result of the election by the 
municipal board of canvassers did not show that Punsalan had received a vote or 
votes for the office contested. It is conceded that all of the persons who, 
according to the proclamation of the municipal board of canvassers, received 
votes for the office contested were made parties to the contest and were duly 
notified. The name of Punsalan not appearing in the proclamation of the 
municipal board of canvassers he was not made a party to the proceedings nor was 
he notified of the contest.</p>
<p>The trial court on the motion to dismiss held that inasmuch as Punsalan had 
actually received votes for the office contested and had not been notified of 
the contest as required by law the court acquired no jurisdiction to proceed and 
dismissed the contest.</p>
<p>We believe that the court erred in this ruling; and by that error deprived 
the contestant of his day in court and of his right to contest the election. The 
contestant cannot be held to do impossible things or to know facts which are 
beyond the possibility of ascertainment prior to the beginning of his contest. 
This court has held on several occasions that the duty of a contestant with 
regard to the persons who shall receive notice of the contest is, in the first 
instance, limited to those named in the proclamation of the municipal board of 
canvassers; and that, if he duly notifies all such persons of the contest, he 
has done all that the law requires him to do up to that time and is entitled to 
have his contest submitted to the court for consideration. The fact that the 
opening of the ballot boxes discloses that some person or persons other than 
those named in the proclamation of the municipal board of canvassers actually 
received a vote or votes for the office contested does not deprive the court of 
jurisdiction to proceed; but the court should allow the contestant to make such 
person party to the contest and to bring him in in the regular way.</p>
<p>We are of the opinion that the plaintiff here was deprived of the opportunity 
to be heard by an error of the court committed in determining a question 
presented by a preliminary objection and that the mandamus should be issued as 
prayed.</p>
<p>Let mandamus issue directed to the Court of First Instance of the Province of 
Cavite directing it to proceed with the hearing of the contest mentioned in this 
proceeding after Francisco Punsalan has been duly made a party to the proceeding 
and brought in in the regular way by the contestant.</p>
<p>If the contestant fails within a reasonable time to bring said Punsalan in as 
a party to the proceedings or fails to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the 
court that he was not a candidate for the office contested the Court of First 
Instance will be authorized to dismiss the proceedings upon the proper 
representations. Costs against Elias Poblete. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Carson, Trent</em>, and <em>Araullo, JJ.</em>, concur.</p></div>
