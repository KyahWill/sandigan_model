				G.R. No. 2939, October 02, 1906</h4>
				<H3>JAIME  SERRA, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE,  VS. GO-HUNA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>TRACEY, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The defendant denies that the lumber, for a part of the price of which this action was brought, was  either bought by him or sold by the plaintiff.  His testimony on  both points is  outweighed by that of the two witnesses for the plaintiff,  who satisfactorily explain the circumstance that the receipt for part of the lumber was signed not by the defendant, but by another Chinaman.  The doubt in the case arises from the failure to prove directly either the fact that the lumber was the property of the estate in plaintiff's hands or the other fact that he was its administrator.</p>
<p>If the lumber had been sold by the intestate, formal proof of the representative character of his administrator might have been required, but inasmuch as the point was not. expressly made  on the trial below and  as  the sale was made in the name of  the plaintiff,, we are of the opinion that the documentary proof, consisting of the bill presented to the defendant made out against him in the name of the plaintiff as administrator and  the receipt for part  of the lumber, running to the plaintiff by  name and signed by defendant's agent, in  the light of the testimony of plaintiff's witnesses and in  the absence of contradictory proof, suffice to  supply the lack of the usual formal testimony.</p>
<p>The judgment of the court  below is affirmed with costs. After the expiration of twenty days let judgment be entered in accordance herewith and ten days thereafter the cause be remanded  to the lower court for proper  procedure.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano,  C. J.,  Torres,  Mapa, Johnson,  Carson,</em> and <em>Willard, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
