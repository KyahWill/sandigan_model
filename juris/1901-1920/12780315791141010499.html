<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The accused appeals from a decision of the Honorable Simplicio del Rosario, 
judge of first instance, city of Manila, finding that the condition of a pardon 
granted by the Honorable Francis Burton Harrison, Governor-General of the 
Philippine Islands, has been violated, and ordering the recommitment of the 
accused in Bilibid Prison for the unexpired portion of his original 
sentence.
<p>The application of the assistant fiscal of the city of Manila to the Court of 
First Instance for the arrest of Exequiel S. Villalon, the accused, and an 
investigation of the facts and action thereon, containing as it does the 
undisputed facts, is here quoted in full:</p>
<p>"Comes now the undersigned and to this Honorable Court respectfully 
states:</p>
<p>"1. That Exequiel S. Villalon about the 5th day of May, 1910, was convicted 
and sentenced by the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija for the crime of 
illegal marriage to imprisonment for eight years and one day of <em>prision 
mayor</em>, with the accessory penalties provided by law, and to pay the 
costs;</p>
<p>"2. That on the 17th of November, 1913, the Hon. Francis Burton Harrison, 
Governor-General of the Philippine Islands, pardoned the said Exequiel S. 
Villalon as to the unexpired portion of the said sentence on condition that the 
accused would not again be guilty of any infraction of the law punishable by 
imprisonment for one year or more, a copy of which conditional pardon is as 
follows:</p>
<p>" 'Office of the Governor-General of the Philippine Islands.—Manila, November 
17, 1913. By authority of the President of the United States, the unexecuted 
portion of the sentence of imprisonment in the case of Exequiel Villalon, 
convicted by the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija of illegal marriage and 
sentenced on June 5, 1910, to imprisonment for eight years and one day, is 
hereby remitted, on condition that he shall not again be guilty of any 
infraction of the law punishable by imprisonment for one year or more. Should 
the condition stated be violated, Exequiel Villalon will be proceeded against in 
the manner prescribed by sections 3 and 4 of Act No. 1524.</p>
<p>" 'Upon acceptance of this pardon, Exequiel Villalon will be released from 
confinement. Francis Burton Harrison, Governor-General.'</p>
<p>"3. That in violation of the conditional pardon above set out, the said 
accused Exequiel S. Villalon, on or about the 17th of November, 1915, in the 
city of Manila, committed and was charged with the crime of <em>estafa</em>, and 
after trial in the Court of First Instance of Manila the said accused was 
sentenced on the 25th day of March, 1916, in accordance with article 535, 
paragraph 1, in connection with article 534, paragraph 2, of the Penal Code, to 
imprisonment for six months of <em>arresto mayor,</em> with the accessory 
penalties provided by law, to indemnify the offended party in the sum of P269.25 
with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay one-half of the 
costs; and</p>
<p>"4. That the accused Exequiel S. Villalon appealed from said sentence to the 
Supreme Court, which court after due hearing affirmed the sentence appealed from 
on November 24, 1916.</p>
<p>"Wherefore, the undersigned, assistant prosecuting attorney of the city of 
Manila, respectfully asks this honorable court to order the appearance of the 
accused, Exequiel S. Villalon, before this court; that due investigation be made 
of the facts set forth in this petition; that it be declared that the accused, 
Exequiel S. Villalon, has violated the conditions of the pardon of November 17, 
1913, and that the said accused be reincarcerated to serve the unexpired portion 
of his sentence, and further asks whatever else may be deemed proper by this 
court in the premises. Angel Roco, assistant prosecuting attorney.</p>
<p>"Subscribed and sworn to before me on June 7, 1917, in the city of Manila, 
Philippine Islands, by Angel Roco, assistant prosecuting attorney of the city of 
Manila. Ramon Avancena, judge, Court of First Instance."</p>
<p>The assignments of error concern the question of whether or not there has 
been a violation of the pardon granted by the Governor-General. The condition of 
the pardon is "that he (Villalon) shall not again be guilty of any infraction of 
the law <em>punishable</em> by imprisonment for one year or more." Recall here 
that Villalon was prosecuted for the crime of <em>estafa</em>, that he was 
convicted and sentenced to six months of <em>arresto mayor</em>, etc., and that 
the limits of the penalty prescribed by the articles of the Penal Code under 
which convicted are two months and one day of <em>arresto mayor</em> to two 
years and four months of <em>presidio correctional</em>.</p>
<p>"Punishable" is defined in the dictionaries as "deserving of or liable to 
punishment." The term refers to the <em>possible</em> not to the <em>actual</em> 
sentence. It is concerned with the penalty which <em>may be</em>, and not which 
is, imposed. Villalon, in committing the crime of <em>estafa</em> and in 
receiving sentence for six months, broke the condition of his pardon just as 
effectively as if he had been convicted of the same crime and sentenced to two 
years and four months imprisonment. The only difference is that the court did 
not, in its discretion, find and apply some aggravating circumstance. 
Undoubtedly what the Governor-General intended to except as favorable to the 
person pardoned were mere convictions for misdemeanors in contrast to what we 
may term, broadly speaking, felonies. Since, therefore, Villalon, in committing 
the crime of <em>estafa,</em> was liable thereby to imprisonment for more than a 
year, he violated both the letter and the spirit of his pardon. The American 
authorities are a unit in corroborating" the views here enunciated. 
(<em>See</em> U. S. <em>vs</em>. Watkinds [1881], 6 Fed., 152; People 
<em>vs</em>. Hughes [1893], 137 N. Y., 29; Benton <em>vs</em>. Commonwealth 
[1893], 89 Va., 570; 7 Words and Phrases, PP. 48, 49.)</p>
<p>The decision of the trial court is affirmed. The accused shall be 
reincarcerated in Bilibid Prison to serve the unexpired portion of the sentence 
imposed upon him for the crime, of illegal marriage by the judge of first 
instance of Nueva Ecija on June 5, 1910; the costs of both instance against the 
appellant. So ordered.</p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Araullo</em>, and

<p><strong>STREET, J.,</strong> dissenting:</p>
<p>It is admitted that the offense of estafa, committed by Exequiel S. Villalon 
upon December 17, 1915, and which is alleged to have constituted a breach of the 
pardon dated November 17, 1913, was an offense punishable under subsection 2 of 
article 534 of the Penal Code. That article permits the application of penalties 
in three degrees, consisting of <em>arresto mayor</em> in its medium degree, 
<em>arresto mayor</em> in its maximum degree, and <em>prision correccional</em> 
in its minimum degree. These penalties, in their complete range, cover a period 
from four months and one day to two years and four months. But as the court 
found that there were neither aggravating nor extenuating circumstances present, 
it became necessary to apply the medium penalty, in accordance with subsection 1 
of article 81, in connection with paragraph 1 of article 97 of the Penal Code. 
Under these provisions it was not possible for the Court of First Instance 
lawfully to impose a penalty of imprisonment of greater duration than six 
months, or <em>arresto mayor</em> in its maximum degree. The finding that there 
was no aggravating circumstance was absolutely determinative on this point; and 
the court had no discretion to go beyond that limit. The intimation contained in 
the principal opinion that, a court may <em>in its discretion</em> find and 
apply an aggravating circumstance is doubtless attributable to oversight.</p>
<p>The word "infraction," to our mind, is used in the pardon with special 
reference to the particular violation of law of which the accused might be 
guilty and not in a general sense as referring to the type or class of offense 
to which such infraction may belong. The word "infraction" is here apparently as 
little liable to be understood in a general sense as any word which could have 
been inserted in the pardon; and the fact that such word was used instead of the 
more general term "offense" or "crime" strongly argues that the draftsman of the 
pardon intended to use the word with special reference to the particular 
violation of law of which the accused might be guilty. The opinion of the court 
has the effect of construing the language of the pardon as if it read, "shall 
not again be guilty of any infraction of law <em>falling within some class of 
crime</em> punishable by imprisonment for one year or more." We think that this 
is an illegitimate interpretation of that language.</p>
<p>The question whether the pardon has been violated depends upon the character 
of the infraction of which the accused has been convicted. The mere fact that 
the defendant was convicted under a complaint which charges <em>estafa</em>—an 
offense punishable with penalties ranging over many different degrees—is not 
sufficient to establish the breach of the pardon. Nor is the duration of the 
penalty which the court actually imposed conclusive as to the fact of the 
infringement of the pardon. To determine whether the infraction was punishable 
by imprisonment for one year or more it is necessary to look to the finding of 
facts upon which the judgment was entered, in this case, that the accused was 
guilty of <em>estafa</em> and punishable under a certain provision of the code, 
without mitigating or aggravating circumstances. If the court had found the 
accused guilty, with aggravating circumstances, the offense would have been 
punishable by the imposition of the penalty of <em>prision correccional</em> in 
its minimum degree; and this would have brought it within the power of the court 
in its discretion to impose a penalty of a year or more. That circumstance would 
have established the infringement of the pardon though the court might in fact 
have imposed imprisonment for only six months and one day.</p>The American 
authorities, it is submitted, in no wise support the conclusion reached by the 
court in the principal opinion. In the American penal system the courts have 
complete liberty, to consider, in the imposition of penalties, all the 
circumstances, whether aggravating or attenuating; and they have entire 
discretion in fixing the penalty at any point between the minimum and maximum 
permitted by law, just as our courts may use a more limited discretion in 
adjusting their penalties within the degrees determined by the presence or 
absence of aggravating circumstances. The American precedents cited in the 
principal opinion are therefore not in point. <br><br><br>
