				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This defendant was charged with the crime of "faithlessness in the custody of documents," in violation of the provisions of&nbsp; paragraph 2 of article 360 of&nbsp; the Penal Code.<p>After&nbsp; hearing the&nbsp; evidence, the lower court found the defendant guilty of the crime&nbsp; charged and sentenced him to be imprisoned for the period of one year and nine months of <em>prision correctional,</em> with the accessories of the law, to pay to Alejo Anupol the sum&nbsp; of&nbsp; P16,&nbsp; to suffer subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, giving him the benefit of one-half the time of imprisonment which he has already suffered, to&nbsp; pay the costs and&nbsp; to&nbsp; be disqualified for twelve years from holding the office of justice of the peace or any other public office in the Philippine Islands.</p><p>From that sentence the defendant appealed.</p><p>The complaint filed against the defendant was as follows:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"On&nbsp; or about&nbsp; the month of October, 1907,&nbsp; the said accused, being auxiliary justice of the peace of San Antonio, and as such entrusted with the documents of that&nbsp; court, heard and decided a civil cause between Leocadio Aguirre and Alejo Anupol, from which decision the latter appealed; but the accused,&nbsp; for the purpose of keeping the deposit of P16 which&nbsp; the appellant made with him,&nbsp; did maliciously and criminally conceal and&nbsp; destroy said cause instead of forwarding it to the Court of First Instance of this province; with serious injury to the parties and to the&nbsp; public. The act occurred in the municipality of San Antonio, Province of Nueva Ecija, P. I., in violation of law."</p></blockquote><p>An examination of&nbsp; the evidence brought to this court discloses the following undisputed facts:</p><p>First. That the defendant was auxiliary&nbsp; justice&nbsp; of the peace of the municipality&nbsp; of San Antonio,&nbsp; Province&nbsp; of Nueva Ecija, in the month of October, 1907.</p><p>Second. That in said month of October, 1907, a&nbsp; case was pending before the said auxiliary justice of the peace between Arcadio Aguirre, as plaintiff, and Alejo Anupol,&nbsp; as defendant.</p><p>Third. That in that action the said defendant herein rendered a decision&nbsp; in favor of the plaintiff and&nbsp; against the defendant.</p><p>Fourth. That after&nbsp; receiving notice of the&nbsp; decision&nbsp; of the defendant herein, Alejo Anupol appealed to the Court of First Instance of the Province&nbsp; of Nueva Ecija, and for that purpose presented a bond and deposited P16&nbsp; with the said defendant herein, thus&nbsp; complying&nbsp; with the&nbsp; requirements for the perfection of an&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; from a decision of the justice of the&nbsp; peace to the Court of First Instance.</p><p>Upon the perfection&nbsp; of the appeal as above stated,&nbsp; it was the duty of&nbsp; the defendant herein to forward to the Court of First Instance the record in the appealed case,&nbsp; together with the P16 (section&nbsp; 38, Act No. 1627) to the Court of First Instance.&nbsp; The defendant&nbsp; herein attempted&nbsp; to prove that he&nbsp; did deliver a certified copy of the record,&nbsp; together with P16 to one Nazario Cando, for the purpose of having said documents&nbsp; and money delivered&nbsp; to&nbsp; the clerk of the Court of First Instance of the Province of Nueva Ecija. This fact is positively denied by Nazario&nbsp; Cando.&nbsp;&nbsp; The defendant presented no receipt showing that he had delivered said documents&nbsp; and money to Nazario Cando, and makes no explanation of his failure to take from&nbsp; Nazario Cando a receipt for the&nbsp; documents and&nbsp; money.&nbsp; The&nbsp; fact is that neither the documents nor the P16 were&nbsp; ever received by the clerk of the Court of First Instance.</p><p>Some time after the perfection of the&nbsp; appeal,&nbsp; the said Alejo Anupol&nbsp; inquired of the clerk of the Court&nbsp; of First Instance if his&nbsp; appeal had been received&nbsp; in the&nbsp; office of the clerk, and upon being&nbsp; informed that the appeal&nbsp; had not been received,&nbsp; he put&nbsp; on foot&nbsp; an administrative investigation concerning&nbsp; the loss&nbsp; of the documents, which investigation was conducted by the Court of First Instance of said province.&nbsp; At the conclusion pf said investigation, the court ordered that the defendant be prosecuted for the crime herein charged against him.</p><p>Another&nbsp; very important fact which goes to show the culpability&nbsp; of&nbsp; the defendant with&nbsp; reference to&nbsp; the facts charged in&nbsp; the complaint is that&nbsp; at the close of his services as auxiliary justice of the peace he delivered to&nbsp; the clerk of the Court of First Instance of said province a list of the causes which had been pending before him as such auxiliary justice of the peace and the&nbsp; cause between Aguirre&nbsp; and Anupol&nbsp; was not included in said list.&nbsp; No explanation&nbsp; is given of this omission.</p><p>The Hon. Julio Llorente,&nbsp; the judge who&nbsp; tried the defendant, commenting upon the&nbsp; declaration of&nbsp; the defendant at the trial of the cause, said:</p><blockquote><p>"The accused testified falsely, and we are convinced that he effected the disappearance of the&nbsp; cause prosecuted against Alejo&nbsp; Anupol in order to make it appear that he had forwarded it to the court with the P16."</p></blockquote><p>The attorney for the defendant in this court attempts to show that&nbsp; the evidence adduced during&nbsp; the&nbsp; trial of the cause demonstrates that&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant is guilty&nbsp; of the crime of estafa and not of the crime charged in said complaint.</p><p>Groizard,&nbsp; in&nbsp; his&nbsp; valuable Commentaries on the&nbsp; Penal Code, with special reference to article 360, in speaking of the essentials of the crime of&nbsp; faithlessness in the custody of documents says:</p><blockquote><p>"Four circumstances are required to establish the crime: (1) that the agent be a public officer; (2) that he abstract, destroy&nbsp; or conceal&nbsp; documents;&nbsp; (3) that&nbsp; the documents which he abstracts, destroys or conceals be entrusted to him by reason of his office; and&nbsp; (4) that injury to a third party or to&nbsp; the&nbsp; public follow&nbsp; from the abstraction, destruction or concealment.&nbsp;&nbsp; If any of these circumstances be not present,&nbsp;&nbsp; the crime&nbsp; disappears, or&nbsp; rather,&nbsp;&nbsp; does&nbsp; not&nbsp; arise." (Groizard, Penal Code of 1870, Vol. IV, p. 146,&nbsp; edition of 1891.)</p></blockquote><p>Viada, in discussing the&nbsp; provisions of the same article of the Penal&nbsp; Code, says:</p><p>"Remember that for the existence of the crime&nbsp; herein specified it is an <em>essential </em>condition&nbsp; that&nbsp; the papers&nbsp; or documents, whose abstraction,&nbsp; destruction or concealment is in question, should have been entrusted to a public officer <em>by reason&nbsp; of his&nbsp; office:</em> otherwise,&nbsp; the&nbsp; abstraction would be converted into the&nbsp; act&nbsp; of a mere private person, and would not&nbsp; be punishable under&nbsp; this article but&nbsp; under number 9 of 548, which applies to those who commit fraud by abstracting, concealing, or&nbsp; rendering useless in&nbsp; whole or in part some cause, record,&nbsp; document or other paper of that kind."&nbsp; (Viada,&nbsp; vol 2, p. 563, edition of 1890.) <br></p><p>It&nbsp; seems clear from all the facts that the defendant&nbsp; is guilty of the crime charged in the complaint and not of the crime of estafa.</p><p>It will be noted&nbsp; that the&nbsp; punishment provided for under article 360 includes imprisonment <em>and</em> <i>a</i> <em>fine. </em>The lower court&nbsp; failed&nbsp; to&nbsp; impose the fine.&nbsp; Under all&nbsp; the circumstances surrounding the commission of the crime charged, as demonstrated by the evidence&nbsp; adduced during the trial of the cause, we are of the opinion that the sentence of the lower court should be affirmed and that in addition thereto a fine should be imposed upon the defendant in the sum of 1,000 pesetas.&nbsp; With this&nbsp; modification, the sentence of the lower court is hereby affirmed.&nbsp; It is so ordered.</p><p><em>Torres, Mapa,&nbsp; Carson,</em> and <em>Moreland, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
