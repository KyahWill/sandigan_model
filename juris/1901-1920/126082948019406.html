				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On the 11th  of December,  1906, a  written information was presented  by George W. Walker  accusing Macaria Ramirez of the crime of estafa committed as  follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"That on or  about the 15th day of April, 1906, in the city of Manila, P. I., the said Macaria Ramirez did then and there willfully, unlawfully, feloniously, with intent of gain, and  without the consent of  the owner thereof, appropriate and convert to her own use P65,  the property of George  W. Walker, then and there received by and in the hands of the said  Macaria Ramirez for the purpose of buying fish and using the said sum in  the business of buying and selling fish  in the said city  of Manila and under the  obligation  then and there to  account  for and deliver the said sum of P65, or the proceeds thereof either in money  or  property of  the said business to the said George W.  Walker; to the damage and prejudice of the said George W. Walker in the sum of P65, equivalent to and of the value of 325 pesetas.  All contrary to law."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Proceedings having been  instituted by virtue  of  the foregoing complaint, the accused pleaded not guilty, and on the 28th of December her  lawyer demurred thereto on the ground  that the facts stated in the complaint did not constitute the crime of  estafa and asked that the case be dismissed and  the accused acquitted, with  the  costs de ofioio.   The prosecuting attorney,  however, moved that the demurrer be overruled, alleging that the complaint had been filed in accordance with paragraph 5 of article 535 of the Penal Code, and cited the case of the United States <em>vs</em>.  Mateo Perez (1 Phil. Bep., 203), a case similar to the present one, wherein, a demurrer having been considered by the court below, the Supreme Court revoked the decision appealed from in  view  of  the  fact that the charge made in the complaint constituted, under the law, a crime and contained all the elements which constitute the crime of estafa; and that, if the accused had actually appropriated the  money received and did not  return  it when requested to do so, the demurrer should be overruled and the accused  obliged to answer the complaint.</p>
<p>The  lower court, however, by an  order dated January 16, sustained the demurrer because the commission of the crime had not been proven and because the  accused had not been given an opportunity  to render accounts or to return the money as required.  From said  decision the prosecution  appealed to this  court.   Article 535, No. 5, of the Penal Code  provides:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Those who, to  the prejudice of another,  shall appropriate  or misapply any money, goods, or any  kind  of personal property which they may have  received as  a deposit on commission for administration or in any other character producing the obligation to deliver or return the same, or who shall deny having received it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The appropriation or conversion of money, among other personal property, received on deposit,  on commission, for administration, or in any other character, producing the obligation to return it,  constitutes  the crime of estafa, the two essential elements  of  which  are deceit and fraud or the  intent to commit the same.</p>
<p>The accused, Macaria Ramirez, received from George W. Walker on or about the 15th day of  April, 1906, the sum of P65 for the purpose of investing the same in the business of buying and selling fish  in  this city, under the  precise obligation  to account for the sum received,  and as,  notwithstanding the lapse of seven months and  twenty-seven days, the accused did not account for the money received nor produce the fish which she ought to have bought with the said P65, it can not be denied that George W. Walker, the owner of the money, has been deceived and is the victim of fraud, because he was fraudulently deprived of the  said sum to his damage and to the prejudice of his interests.</p>
<p>George W. Walker did  not deliver the P65 to Macaria Ramirez as a gift or present in order that she might dispose of the  same at will.  She received the  money for  the purpose of using it in the business of buying and selling fish, and  when  seven months and  some days  transpire without the appearance of the fish or of the money which according to the accused was to have been invested therein, it becomes  evident that Ramirez acted with deceit and bad faith to the prejudice of Walker, and that, therefore, the acts stated in the complaint have been committed and they constitute the crime of estafa.   And if it is true, as alleged by the defense, that the accused had not appropriated the money received by her, but supposing that it was used in the purchase of  fish,  the latter should have been sold at once, and in such case it can not be denied that the proceeds of the sale  remained in the hands of the accused, Ramirez, who managed the business, and, from the fact that she did not return  the money to the owTner thereof, as it was her duty to do, she has appropriated the same,  because  the said sum of P65 was  delivered to her not in order that she might convert it to her  OAvn use but to be returned after the business for which the money was intended  had been transacted.</p>
<p>The consummation  of the crime of estafa—that is,  the fraudulent appropriation of the said P65—does not depend on the fact that a request for the return of the  money is first made and refused in order that the author of the crime should  comply  with  the  obligation  to return  the  sum misapplied. The appropriation or conversion  of money received to the prejudice of the owner thereof are the  sole essential facts which  constitute the  crime of estafa,  and thereupon the author thereof incurs  the penalty imposed by the Penal Code.</p>
<p>For the  foregoing considerations  there  was no  legal reason whereby the exception to the complaint should have been  considered,  and the  court below should have  overruled the same and ordered that the case be proceeded with. Therefore; in view of the provisions of section 44 of General  Orders, No.  58,  it is our opinion that the judgment, dated January 16, this year, appealed  from  must  be reversed and  the demurrer overruled.  Let  the cause be remanded to the court from whence it came, with instructions to proceed accordingly, and that judgment be entered in  conformity with the law, with  the costs de oficio.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano,  C. J., Johnson,  Willard,</em> and<em> Tracey,  JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
