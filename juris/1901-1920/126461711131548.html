				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE, VS. E. S. LEWIS, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>LADD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The appellant was convicted  October 24, 1902, by  the Court of First Instance of Manila,  of  larceny,  and sentenced to  eight months of <em>presidio correccional</em>.  He appealed, and November 4, 1902, he furnished a bond and wa^s admitted to bail by the trial court.  The appeal has not yet come on for hearing in this court.</p>
<p>Two motions have been presented, one  by the Government asking that a period be fixed within which the sureties on the bail bond be required  to bring the accused  before this court, and that upon their failure so to do the bond be declared forfeited; the other by  Mr. Tutherly, counsel for the appellant, who  makes affidavit to the effect that  his client has left Manila for parts unknown, and is probably beyond the jurisdiction of the  court, and asks  that  all proceedings in the case be  suspended during his absence.</p>
<p>The presence of the appellant  in  this court is not necessary in order that the appeal may be heard and judgment rendered, nor do the sureties on the bail bond given by him undertake that he will be present in this court either before the hearing or at the hearing; their undertaking is "that lie will pay such fine as the appellate court may direct, or will surrender himself in  execution of such judgment as the appellate court may render, or tluit, in case the cause is remanded for a new trial, lie will appear in the court to which  it  may  he remanded  and  submit himself  to  the orders and processes thereof" (G.O., No. 58, sec. 65).  The sureties may of course prevent the accused from leaving the jurisdiction, if they think it is unsafe to allow him to do so (G. O., No. 58,  sec. 75) ; the court may increase the amount of the. bond  if it is  insufficient  (G. O., No.  58, sec. 72), hut the Government can not enforce a forfeiture of  the bond  until a breach  of the condition has occurred, which can not  be before the rendition of judgment by this court.</p>
<p>For the reasons stated, both motions are denied.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C.J.,Cooper. Willard, Mapa</em> and <em>McDonough, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em> Torres, J.,</em> did not sit in this case.<br>
