				<H3>IN RE ESTATE OF THE DECEASED CHINAMAN BERNARDO RAFANAN LAO SAYCO, ALIAS SAYA.  LAY CHUYTING, APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> This is  an appeal by the Chinaman Lao Chiama, administrator of the estate  of  the  decedent  Bernardo Rafanan Lao Sayco,<em> alias</em>  Saya,  and  guardian of the minor  Lay Chuyting,  from the judgment  rendered  in these  special proceedings by the Honorable Judge, Ramon Avancena.</p>
<p> Counsel for  the  municipal president of  the  pueblo of Mambajao,  complying with a resolution  of  the council of the said pueblo, set forth in an undated petition filed with the Court of First Instance of Misamis:</p>
<p> That, on January 23, 1906, the municipal council of Mambajao  appeared in the said proceedings  and prayed that, since Bernardo Rafanan died in that pueblo without leaving any known  legitimate successor,  the  real and  personal property left  by the said decedent within the district of the aforementioned municipality be awarded to the latter, pursuant to the provisions of section  571 (<em>sic</em>) of Act  No. 190, which  property was specified in the inventory presented by the testamentary executor, Lao Chiama, and that no  ruling had  been  made on the  said  petition; that,  on October  19 of  the same year,  the  administrator,  Lao Chiama,  filed  a written petition wherein he alleged  that there were no longer any debts to pay and therefore requested that,  upon the approval of his final account, his administration be closed, and, as the guardian of the Chinaman Lay Chuyting, requested  that the property referred to be delivered  to the latter as the son and sole heir of the decedent Raf anan; that the municipal council of Mambajao, which believed that it was entitled to the said property, opposed  its delivery to the alleged heir, whose character as  such  was denied by the petitioner, who therefore prayed that he be admitted as a party to the proceedings and that a day be set for the hearing of the case, in order that the alleged heir, Lay Chuyting, might prove his right, and  should he fail so to do,  then that the right of the municipal council  of  Mambajao be recognized,  with such other findings,  in addition,  as law  and justice  might demand.</p>
<p> Lao  Chiama,  administrator of the property  of the  decedent Rafanan and guardian of the minor Lay Chuyting, opposed in writing the petition of the municipality of Mambajao,  on the ground that the said decedent left a  legal heir, the minor Lay Chuyting, residing in China, who  was a son of the  deceased Lao Ta, the latter a brother of the decedent Bernardo Rafanan Lao Sayco, and that, therefore, Lay  Chuyting was the latter's nephew,  and not  his son, as previously erroneously stated  in the  course of  these  proceedings.  Petitioner  stated that he desired to take the depositions of witnesses in the city of  Cebu, in order to establish the facts set forth by him  and asked that the hearing of the case be set for the month of June, 1907.</p>
<p> A hearing in these proceedings was had on February 20, 1908, after notice had been served on all who might have any interest in the intestate succession concerned, and after the publication of  the decrees for three weeks prior to the date set.   In  view of the  depositions  of witnesses  presented at the  trial, the court,  on March 5, 1908, rendered judgment ordering that the property left by the decedent,  Bernardo Rafanan Lao Sayco, known by the name of Saya, be assigned  to the municipality of Mambajao, Province of Misamis,  to be administered by its municipal council and placed at  the  disposal of  the schools  in  the  same manner as other property intended for the same use.  It was further ordered that the administrator of the intestate estate, after  paying the actual expenses and debts  chargeable thereto, deliver the remainder to  the  municipality of Mambajao, and afterwards  report  to  the  Court of  First Instance his  compliance with and fulfillment  of the order. From this judgment the said administrator and guardian of the minor Lay  Chuyting appealed,  for which purpose a  certified copy of the record was forwarded to the clerk of this court.</p>

  This case concerns the reversion to the State of certain property which was left at death by the Chinaman Bernardo Rafanan Lao Sayco, <em>alias</em> Saya, who died in the pueblo of Mambajao, Province of Misamis, apparently without having executed any will during his lifetime and without  leaving any known heirs in said locality.<br>
  <br>
<p>Section 750  of the  Code of Civil  Procedure, applicable to the case, reads as follows:</p>
 <blockquote>
   <p> "When  a person  dies intestate, seized of  real or  personal property  in the Philippine Islands, leaving no heir or person by law entitled to the same, the president and municipal council  of the municipality where the deceased last resided, if he was an inhabitant of these  Islands, or of the municipality  in which he had estate, if he resided out of the Islands, may, on behalf of the municipality, file a petition with  the Court of First Instance of the  province for an  inquisition in the premises; the court shall thereupon appoint a  time  and place of hearing and  deciding on such petition, and cause a notice thereof to be published in  some newspaper of general circulation in the province of which the deceased was last  an inhabitant, if within the  Philippine Islands, and if not in some newspaper of general circulation in the province in which he  had  estate.   The notice shall recite the substance of the facts and request set forth in the petition, the time and place at which persons  claiming the estate may appear and be heard before the court, and shall be published at least six weeks successive the last of which publications shall be at least six weeks  before  the  time appointed by the court to make inquisition."</p>
 </blockquote>
<p>From the record of these proceedings it does not appear that there was made, at the request of counsel for the  president and the municipal council of Mambajao, the inquisition provided by law, specified in the preinserted section, for the record is not accompanied by any certified copy of the inventory of the real and personal .property that belonged to the said decedent, with a statement of the places where the realty is located.  Neither is it shown to have been ascertained whether the deceased Chinaman executed any will during his lifetime, or whether he left  in  Mambajao or  in any other place in these Islands any relative entitled to inherit from  him,  information  in regard to which points might be furnished by those who were his friends or with whom he had friendly  dealings during  his lifetime.   Moreover, the notice summoning the persons who believed they were entitled to his property  should have  been published for at least  six consecutive  weeks,  and not for three  as was directed in the order of December 16, 1907.</p>

  <p>In order that the property which belonged to the decedent Bernardo Rafanan  Lao  Sayco, situated  in these Islands, may be  decreed to have reverted to the State, pursuant to the provisions of section 751 of the Code of Civil  Procedure,  it is indispensable that the requirements contained in the above-quoted section of the said code should have been complied with by making the inquisition with regard to the matters specified, at the instance  of the interested municipality.  Furthermore,  the person who lays claim to the property left  by the decedent  at  death, as  the latter's successor or heir, must prove his  identity and  rights.</p>
  <br>
  Counsel for the municipality of Mambajao merely prayed for an order of reversion and for the adjudication in behalf     of the municipality of the property aforementioned; he  did not  comply with  the provisions of the  law by furnishing the  required proofs  in regard to  the matters  hereinabove indicated, which must  be the subject of an investigation.<p></p>
<p> For the reasons aforestated, it is proper,  in our opinion, to reverse the judgment  appealed from, and we  dismiss these  proceedings,  without  prejudice to  any  rights that may pertain to the parties with respect to the property in question.   No express finding is made of the costs.</p>
