				<H3>MANILA ELECTRIC RAILROAD AND LIGHT COMPANY, PLAINTIFF, VS. SIMPLICIO DEL ROSARIO, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MANILA, AND DOROTEO JOSE, DEFENDANTS.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>One Doroteo Jose, a resident of the city of Manila, had a contract with the Manila Electric Railroad and Light Company, by virtue of which Jose received, and the Light Company furnished electricity for lighting purposes for several years.   The Light Company suspected Jose of unlawfully appropriating electric current, by the use of a device whereby the meter installed in Josh's residence failed to register all the current used by  him. A criminal complaint charging Jose with this offense, was dismissed, and Jose" acquitted of the offense with which he was charged.  Thereafter the Light Company presented a bill to Jose" for the amount which it claimed he was indebted to it on account of the electricity which it alleged  in the criminal  complaint  had been unlawfully appropriated  by  him,  and  upon Jose's refusal to pay the bill, the company cut the wire connecting Jose's residence with its power house, and  refused thereafter to furnish electric current  to Jose,  unless and until its  claim for current  which  it alleges  was unlawfully appropriated by him is paid.</p>
<p>Thereupon Jose filed  a complaint in the Court of First Instance of Manila,  praying for a writ of mandamus to compel the Light Company to furnish him with electricity under his contract with the  company; and under the rules, regulations, ordinances  and laws under and by virtue of which the Light Company is operating in the city of Manila; and procured, ex parte,  the issuance of a preliminary mandatory injunction directing the  Light Company to continue furnishing electricity to Jose upon the terms and conditions set forth in the  complaint, pending the final determination of the mandamus proceedings.</p>
<p>The Light Company is now before us, praying that a writ of certiorari issue to the judge of the court below who granted  the preliminary mandatory  injunction, on  the ground  that in  doing so he exceeded his jurisdiction, or rather that he was without jurisdiction to issue an injunction of this nature.</p>
<p>Counsel for the  Light Company bases his contentions in this court strictly on his  proposition that the Courts of First Instance in these Islands are wholly without jurisdiction to issue preliminary mandatory injunctions under any circumstances whatever; and in open court he waived all objections based on other alleged defects and informalities in the proceedings had in the court below.</p>
<p>Counsel's contention appears to be that the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure touching the issue of preliminary injunctions do not contemplate the granting of preliminary mandatory injunctions, and that in the absence of express statutory authority the courts of these Islands have no jurisdiction to issue such injunctions.</p>
<p>This  contention cannot be maintained.  Modeled  as  are our courts and indeed our whole judicial system upon  Anglo-American precedents, we are of opinion that the power to grant preliminary injunctions, both preventative and mandatory,  is a logical  and necessary  incident of the general powers  conferred upon  Courts of  First Instance in these Islands as courts of record of general and unlimited original jurisdiction both legal and equitable. to secure the rights of the litigants in actions  pending in these courts it may, and often does become necessary to preserve the status quo of the parties or of the subject matter in litigation.  To this end the power to grant  preliminary injunctions, where no other adequate remedy is provided in the ordinary course of law, is an important and, if complete justice  is to be done between the parties, a  necessary incident  of the general jurisdiction conferred upon these courts.  Of course, in so far as the statute limits or prescribes the exercise of this power it must be followed; but beyond this, and in cases not covered or contemplated by the statute, our courts must exercise their jurisdiction in the issuance of preliminary injunctions upon sound principles applicable  to the circumstances of each particular case, having  in mind the nature of the remedy, and  the  doctrine established in the  courts upon which our judicial  system is based, </p>
<p>Section 55 of Act No. 136, in express  terms confers upon Courts of First Instance the jurisdiction to  grant writs of injunction generally, but prescribes that they shall be issued in the <em>"manner"</em> provided in the Code of Civil Procedure. The  <em>"method"</em> of obtaining preliminary injunctions generally is set forth in section 166 of Act No. 190, the Code of Civil Procedure; and while there is ground for the contention that the legislator in prescribing that method had in mind the granting of preliminary preventative injunctions only, we think that it provides at the same time the <em>"manner"</em>  in  which  preliminary  mandatory injunctions should be obtained. As we have said already, the power to issue injunctions generally, including, as we hold,  mandatory as well as preventative injunctions, is not only a logical and essential incident of the general and unlimited equitable and  legal jurisdiction conferred upon Courts of First Instance, but is expressly  conferred upon them  under the provisions  of  section 55  of Act No. 136,  with the single proviso, that this jurisdiction is to be exercised in the manner provided in the Code of Civil Procedure.  It follows that whether or not the code in express terms provides the manner for the issuance  of a particular class of injunctions, jurisdiction to issue such injunctions must be maintained, if the manner in which such injunctions  may be  issued can fairly be inferred from the general provisions of the code, or from its  provisions for the issuance of injunctions generally.</p>
<p>It  may be admitted that since an injunction mandatory in its nature usually tends to do more than to maintain the <em>status quo</em>, it is generally improper to issue such an injunction  prior to the final hearing: but on the other hand,  in cases of extreme urgency; where the right is very clear; where considerations of relative inconvenience bear strongly in complainant's favor; where there is a willful and unlawful invasion of plaintiff's right against his protest and remonstrance, the injury being a continuing one; and where the effect of the mandatory injunction is rather to reestablish and maintain a preexisting continuing relation between the parties, recently  and arbitrarily interrupted  by the defendant, than to establish a new relation, we hold that the jurisdiction to grant  such injunctions undoubtedly exists; and while caution must be exercised in their  issuance, the writ should not be denied the complainant when he makes out a clear case, free from doubt and dispute.</p>
<p>We agree with counsel  for petitioner that a mandatory preliminary injunction should not issue where mandamus proceedings in  themselves furnish an adequate remedy; or indeed in .any case where adequate relief for the threatened injury will be furnished by an action at law or where adequate means of redress are in the hands of the complainant without the need for its issuance. But cases do and will arise wherein no adequate remedy  exists  other  than the issuance of a preliminary mandatory injunction, and we think the case at bar furnishes an excellent illustration of a considerable class of such cases.</p>
<p>Where a public service corporation which has acquired a substantial monopoly of the supply of light, power, water, transportation  or the like, undertakes arbitrarily,  and in manifest defiance and violation of the laws, ordinances and regulations under and by virtue of which it operates, to discriminate against one of those dependent upon it for the supply of such necessaries, and without just cause or excuse, arbitrarily and in manifest violation of a continuing duty imposed upon it by law and its  own contracts,  ceases to furnish such necessaries under such conditions that a mandamus will lie to compel it to do so, we think there  can be no doubt that pending the final determination of the mandamus proceedings the court wherein such proceedings are pending has jurisdiction to issue a temporary mandatory injunction in a case where the injury complained of is a continuing one and  where the invasion of the rights of the  complainant during  the  pendency of  the  proceedings  would  work  a serious injury for which there is no other adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law.</p>
<p>The undisputed facts in the case at bar  clearly disclose that the Light Company has no valid claim against Jose on account of electricity furnished or received by him; that its action in refusing to continue to furnish electricity to his residence constitutes an arbitrary invasion of his rights, in open violation of the laws, regulations and ordinances under which the company operates; that the continued refusal to furnish electricity  pending  the  mandamus  proceedings instituted in the court below would result in serious injury to Jose for which he has no other adequate remedy than a preliminary mandatory injunction; and that the court below had therefore jurisdiction to issue the preliminary injunction complained of.</p>
<p>The petition in this case should be and is therefore dismissed, with the costs against the petitioner.</p>
