				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On the 27th of May, 1908, the complaint was filed against Tan Tok.&nbsp; The crime charged was estafa, consisting in that on&nbsp; the 1st of April, 1908, he had been sold upon credit a bale of gray cloth for P260, and this bale afterwards appeared&nbsp; included in&nbsp; an attachment,&nbsp; made on&nbsp; petition of Findlay &amp; Co., of the store at No. 144 Calle Rosario, as of the property of another Chinaman named Uy Chieng Can and sold as a result of Findlay &amp; Co.'s claim against this other Chinaman - Behn, Meyer &amp; Co., who had sold the bale to Tan&nbsp; Tok, losing&nbsp; the price thereof.&nbsp; Had Tan Tok not assured Behn, Meyer &amp; Co. that the store at No. 144 was exclusively his and that he had already severed connections with the business&nbsp; carried on by Uy Chieng Can, who conducted the store at&nbsp; No. 156 on the same street, he&nbsp; would not have been trusted with that bale of gray cloth valued at P260.<br><br>The order for the merchandise was given by Tan Tok to Behn, Meyer &amp; Co. on March 26, 1908.&nbsp; On April 1 or 2 the bale was taken to the store at No. 144, which was supposed to belong to Tan&nbsp; Tok.&nbsp; On&nbsp; April&nbsp; 4,&nbsp; 1908, the document evidencing the debt&nbsp; for the price of the bale, that is, for P260, was signed.&nbsp; First it was signed with a square stamp, which meant nothing.&nbsp; The document was again taken to the store at No. 144&nbsp; and was returned&nbsp; signed with another stamp which reads:&nbsp; "Benito <i>Uy Chieng Can</i>, Rosario, 156."<br><br>Tan Tok says that on March 29,&nbsp; 1908, the said store at No. 144 was sold by him to Uy Chieng Can.<br><br>So that when, on April 1 or 2, 1908, the bale of gray cloth ordered by&nbsp; Tan Tok on the&nbsp; 26th of March previous was received in the said store,&nbsp; it was in&nbsp; fact received in a store belonging to Uy Chieng Can, and&nbsp; this is how that document of debt&nbsp; for&nbsp; the price of&nbsp; the&nbsp; bale appears as signed by Uy Chieng Can; and Deogracias Zamora, a clerk in the employ of Behn, Meyer &amp; Co., says that he called the matter to the attention of a principal employee of the firm, who had Tan Tok come to the office; but&nbsp; what the said employee did afterwards does not appear in the record.<br><br>Up to May,&nbsp; when the bale in question was in the possession of the sheriff for sale,&nbsp; the only thing done was to prosecute the criminal action&nbsp; for <i>estafa.</i><br><br>In this class of operations where, with more or less caution, one relies upon a person's credit, there is no estafa. If a person already&nbsp; enjoyed&nbsp; credit&nbsp; and it was afterwards withdrawn, but subsequently, because of his apparently conducting his operations in a manner which appears to warrant it he again secures credit and does&nbsp; not pay for what he gets by reason of&nbsp; the credit thus continued, he does not thereby commit the crime of&nbsp; <i>estafa</i>, which it is evident he would not have committed by availing himself of the credit in the beginning.<br><br>To the creditor, the firm of Behn, Meyer &amp; Co,, is reserved the right to bring such civil&nbsp; action as may be proper for the recovery of the&nbsp; value of the&nbsp; merchandise sold upon credit, against the debtor, Tan Tok,&nbsp; or whoever may be found to be indebted&nbsp; for its price.<br><br>The judgment of the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila is reversed, with costs in both instances <i>de oficio.</i> So ordered.<br><br><i>Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson,</i> and <i>Moreland, JJ.</i>, concur.<br></div>
