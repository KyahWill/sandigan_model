				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>It is a fact, fully proven in the present case, that on the afternoon of July 11, 1902, Felix Manalang, a member of the Constabulary forces stationed in the Province of Pampanga, went with two companions to the  house of Tomas Lacsamana, situated  in Bacolor, in search  of a revolver. Lacsamana denied that he had such a weapon in his possession.  He was  thereupon seized and stretched on the ground and tortured by being compelled to swallow water, which was forced into him through a  piece of  cane placed in his mouth.  In the course of the proceedings his assailants broke one of his teeth.  He was then taken to one of the stations in the town of Santa Rita, where he was kept until the night of the 12th following.  On this  date the defendant obtained from Ines Garcia, the wife of Lacsamana, the delivery of the sum of 15 pesos, which Eugenio Tayo, by order of the accused, demanded from Lacsamana's wife as a  condition of his liberation.   She was told that if she did not pay the sum of money it would go hard with her husband.  This sum, which Felipe Garcia loaned Lacsamana's wife, having been  received by the accused, one of his companions, Felix Alejo, Avent to the station and told Lacsamana that he might go, which  he did.  The delivery of the money to Manalang, on the night of July 12, 1902,  was witnessed by the wife of the complainant, by Eugenio Tayo, and  by Catalino Lacsamana.   Pedro de Jesus, member of the municipal council for the barrio of Potrero, reported these facts to the municipal president of the town, who,  in turn, reported them to the provincial fiscal, and the latter thereupon filed the information upon which this case is prosecuted.</p>
<p> These facts, which are fully  proven by  the evidence, constitute  the offense defined and punished by section 19 of Act No. 175, passed July 18, 1901.  The defendant, a inember of the Constabulary, by means of the persecution, ill treatment,  and arrest of  Tomas Lacsamana obtained the sum of 15 pesos, which the said accused converted to his own use, holding tin; complainant in his custody until this sum was paid, thereby committing  the crime defined and punished by the said law.</p>
<p> The accused pleaded not guilty to the charge, but, notwithstanding his denial and exculpative allegations, which are entirely unsupported by evidence, the record sufficiently discloses his guilt.  The fact that the complainant was ill  treated and tortured  by being compelled to swallow a considerable  quantity of water through a bamboo thrust into his mouth, and in which proceeding one of his teeth was broken; that Tomas Lacsamana was unlawfully imprisoned for more than twenty-four hours in a barrio police station without having been taken before any proper authority; that the defendant demanded the sum of 15 pesotf from the wife of the complainant as a condition to his release and did not liberate him until the money was paid, are facts which are fully  established by the evidence in the case1.   It follows, consequently, that the defendant, Felix Manalang, is the  author,  by direct participation, of the crime  prosecuted, and  that he  has  incurred the  penalty prescribed by section 19 of Act No. 175, above referred to.</p>
<p> The counsel  for the defendant contends that the information was defective by reason of its failure to state that the accused at the time of  the commission of the offense was an officer or member of the Constabulary forces, this being essential  for the existence of the crime prosecuted. This objection is unavailing, as no exception  was taken to this  defect by counsel for the defendant in  the court below, in which it might have been successfully raised by demurrer.  Furthermore,  the  objection is not well taken, because the defendant was  arrested, appeared before the judge,  and was present throughout the trial, and even testified in his own behalf as a member of the Constabulary, without  having denied  his  character as such, or making any  objection  to  being  so considered and prosecuted. Therefore such a defect does not vitiate the proceedings, nor has it prejudiced any essential right of the defendant. For those reasons this  objection,  raised in the appellate court,  does not constitute sufficient  ground  for  the annulment of the proceedings below or the reversal of the judgment.</p>
<p> The offense punished in section 19 of Act No. 175 is complex and consists  of various acts  specified by the law, all of which are included in the punishable act to which the law refers.  For this reason it is not strange that an information charging the offense  punished by the law should contain a statement of the various acts which constitute an integral part of the crime in question.</p>
<p> For  these reasons, therefore, and considering that the commission of the  crime prosecuted and the guilt of the defendant are  fully established by the record, the  judgment appealed should be affirmed, with the penalty therein imposed upon  the  defendant,  and  with the costs  of this instance against him.  So ordered.</p>
<p> <em> Arellano, C. J., Cooper,  Willard,  Mapa,</em> and <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
