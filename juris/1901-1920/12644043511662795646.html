				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from an order of the Court of First Instance of Misamis, 
sustaining a demurrer to a complaint, wherein plaintiff sought relief from a 
judgment of a justice of the peace, alleging that that judgment was void for 
lack of jurisdiction.<br><p><br>Plaintiff in this action alleges that the justice 
of the peace assumed jurisdiction to hear and decide a complaint, wherein 
plaintiff sought possession of certain real estate, alleging that by virtue of a 
contract for the sale thereof, under the terms of which the vendor retained the 
right to repurchase prior to a certain date (<em>venta con pacto de retro</em>), 
he had become the owner of this real estate, the vendor having failed to 
exercise his right to repurchase within the time stipulated. The justice of the 
peace assumed jurisdiction on the ground that the facts set forth gave the 
vendor the right to an action in his court for the possession of the land, under 
the provisions of section section 80 of Act No. 190. </p>
<p>The trial judge, in the case at bar, was of opinion that the justice of the 
peace had jurisdiction to hear and decide the case, and on that ground sustained 
the demurrer to the complaint. But this court, in the case of Falcon 
<em>vs.</em> Barretto (26 Phil. Rep., 72), held that justices of the peace have 
no jurisdiction to hear and decide cases in summary proceedings as provided in 
section 80 of Act No. 190, wherein plaintiff seeks possession of land by virtue 
of alleged rights of ownership acquired under the terms of deeds of sale with 
the right to repurchase (<em>ventas con pacto de retro</em>).</p>
<p>It is clear that under the ruling in that case the justice of the peace had 
nq jurisdiction to enter the judgment, relief from which is sought in the case 
at bar, and that the order entered in the court below, sustaining the demurrer 
to the complaint, should be set aside.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Moreland, Trent,</em> and <em>Araullo, J.,</em> 
concur.<br></p></div>
