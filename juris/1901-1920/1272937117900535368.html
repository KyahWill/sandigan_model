				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The question before the court arises upon an appeal from a&nbsp; judgment of the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of the city of Manila entered upon an order&nbsp; sustaining a demurrer and dismissing the complaint.<br><br>The action was brought by the plaintiff personally against the defendant&nbsp; personally.&nbsp; The plaintiff's cause of action, however, shows that the action should have been&nbsp; brought by the&nbsp; plaintiff as administrator&nbsp; of&nbsp; the estate of&nbsp; Antonio de Inchusagarri against the defendant as administrator of the estate of Julian Almenara.&nbsp;&nbsp; The complaint prays that a&nbsp; sale of certain goods&nbsp; belonging&nbsp; to the estate represented by the&nbsp; defendant be set aside&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the ground that said property was bought by the defendant himself, for his own benefit, in violation of law.<br><br>The body of the complaint shows, in substance, that Antonio de Inchusagarri&nbsp; at&nbsp; the time of his demise was&nbsp; a creditor of Almenara, and, on the latter's death, presented a claim against his estate,&nbsp; which was duly allowed&nbsp; in form of law; that it was ascertained eventually&nbsp; that there was not sufficient property to pay all&nbsp; of the debts outstanding against the&nbsp; estate of Almenara, and therefore the careful conservation of the property of the estate became a matter of prime importance to all the creditors; that this action was&nbsp; brought on the&nbsp; theory that&nbsp; a certain portion of the property of the estate of AJmenara having been bought by the defendant&nbsp; for his&nbsp; own&nbsp; personal use and&nbsp; benefit, he being at&nbsp; the time&nbsp; administrator of the estate, said estate was by that transaction defrauded of assets&nbsp; which ought to have gone to pay the legitimate debts of the estate, among which was that&nbsp; held&nbsp; by the plaintiff&nbsp; as administrator of the estate of said Inchusagarri.<br><br>That the action was wrongfully brought in&nbsp; the name of the plaintiff personally is beyond question.&nbsp; That the demurrer to the complaint, based upon that ground, should have been&nbsp; sustained is equally beyond question.&nbsp; This&nbsp; court has repeatedly held, however (Balderrama <i>vs.</i> Compania General de Tabacos de Filipinas, 13 Phil. Rep., 609; Molina vs. La Electricista, 6 Phil.&nbsp; Rep., 519; Serrano <i>vs.</i> Serrano, 9 Phil. Rep., 142), that where a demurrer to a complaint is sustained and the complaint dismissed, the court, in dismissing the complaint,&nbsp; should give the&nbsp; plaintiff an opportunity to amend in such way as to eliminate the objection&nbsp; presented by the demurrer&nbsp; (sec. 101, Code of Civil Procedure).&nbsp; This was not done by the court below.<br><br>The judgment appealed from should be and is hereby modified in that&nbsp; particular and the cause remanded to the lower court, with instructions that the plaintiff&nbsp; be given five days within which&nbsp; to present an amended complaint after due notice of this decision.&nbsp;&nbsp; If an amended complaint is not filed within that time, the lower court shall enter an order dismissing the complaint upon&nbsp; the merits.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is so ordered.<br><br><i> Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson,</i> and <i>Trent, JJ., </i> concur.<br></div>
