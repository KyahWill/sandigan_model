				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This was an&nbsp; action commenced to foreclose a&nbsp; mortgage executed by the defendant to the plaintiff's assignor.&nbsp; The trial of the cause was set for the 22d day of October, 1908. The defendant, who appeared&nbsp; and answered in person, was sick on that day and notified the court&nbsp; of his inability to be&nbsp; present.&nbsp; The court&nbsp; thereupon adjourned the trial of the cause to the 2d day&nbsp; of November following.&nbsp; A notice of the adjournment, giving the date to which the cause had been continued, was sent to the defendant.&nbsp;&nbsp; He claims that he did not receive it until after the day to which the cause was adjourned for trial.&nbsp; As a result&nbsp; a&nbsp; default was taken against the&nbsp; defendant,&nbsp; the&nbsp; usual proceedings were&nbsp; had before the court, and on&nbsp; the 6th day of November the usual judgment of foreclosure in the cause was rendered.<br><br>The defendant&nbsp; upon receiving notice of the rendition and entry of the judgment made the following motion:<br><blockquote>"The defendant in the above entitled cause appears and respectfully shows that&nbsp; he asks upon&nbsp; reasons of justice a new trial&nbsp; upon the following ground:&nbsp; For the reason that I have been the&nbsp; victim of&nbsp; an&nbsp; accident which ordinary prudence&nbsp; would not have been able to avoid, having been sick at the time of the trial and having for that reason been prejudiced in my legal&nbsp; rights in the&nbsp; case; therefore, the judgment is contrary to law."</blockquote>In&nbsp; order to&nbsp; determine whether or not this court can review the evidence in this case, it is necessary to&nbsp; decide whether the ground upon which the&nbsp; above motion for a new trial&nbsp; is based is a sufficient ground under section 497,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>subdivision 2, of the&nbsp; Code of Civil Procedure.&nbsp; That sub-division reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"2. If the excepting party&nbsp; filed a motion in&nbsp; the Court of First&nbsp; Instance for a new trial, upon the ground that" the. evidence was insufficient to&nbsp; justify the&nbsp; decision, and the judge overruled said motion,&nbsp; and due exception was taken to his overruling the same, the Supreme&nbsp; Court may review the evidence and make such&nbsp; findings upon the facts by a" preponderance of the evidence, and render such final judgment, as justice and equity may&nbsp; require.&nbsp; But,&nbsp; if the Supreme Court shall be&nbsp; of&nbsp; the opinion that this exception is frivolous and not made in good faith, it may impose double or treble additional costs upon&nbsp; the&nbsp; excepting&nbsp; party, and may order them to be paid by the counsel prosecuting the bill of exceptions, if in its opinion justice so requires."</blockquote>Having in&nbsp; mind the provisions of that section, we are of the opinion that&nbsp; the motion is not sufficient to&nbsp; permit this court to review the evidence.&nbsp; Said motion is not based upon any of the grounds specified in said section.&nbsp;&nbsp; A motion for a new&nbsp; trial upon the ground that the&nbsp; decision is contrary to law raises no question as to the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the decision.<br><br>The court in deciding the case said:<br><blockquote>"At the trial&nbsp; of the case, the&nbsp; defendant not&nbsp; having appeared at the time fixed by the court and the plaintiff having proved the allegations of his complaint, which were&nbsp; denied by the answer,&nbsp; by means of documentary proofs, Exhibit A, Exhibit&nbsp; Cause No. 45, relating to the. guardianship&nbsp; of the children of&nbsp; F. Suarez, as to&nbsp; the payment to D. Angel Ortiz by the&nbsp; defendant of&nbsp; the sum of four hundred and ninety-five pesos and thirty-three centavos&nbsp; (P495.33) and the interest at 10 per cent&nbsp; annually from the 17th day&nbsp; of November, 1906, to the time of its payment, with the costs of the present trial - It is ordered that&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant deposit&nbsp; the sum above named&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; clerk's&nbsp; office&nbsp; of this court, etc."<br></blockquote>The part of the decision above&nbsp; quoted contains all of the findings of fact.<br><br>The second&nbsp; question in this case is whether or not such findings&nbsp; are sufficient to support the decision.&nbsp;&nbsp; The reference to Exhibit A in the decision, which Exhibit A is the mortgage being&nbsp; foreclosed,&nbsp; is not sufficient&nbsp; to&nbsp; make that mortgage a part of the decision.&nbsp;&nbsp; We may not, therefore, examine said mortgage upon the theory that such reference incorporated it into the decision so as to become an integral part thereof.&nbsp; Such mortgage could easily have&nbsp; been made a part of the decision if appropriate words for that purpose had been used.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such mortgage is not before us.<br><br>The&nbsp; only finding of fact contained in the decision is the statement that the facts&nbsp; alleged in the complaint were proved.&nbsp;&nbsp; The weight of authority seems to be that the findings of the court may refer to the pleadings for the facts found if&nbsp; such reference is sufficiently distinct and if&nbsp; the facts are sufficiently stated&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; pleadings,&nbsp; (McEwen <i>vs.</i> Johnson, 7 Cal., 258; Breeze <i>vs</i>. Doyle, 19&nbsp; Cal., 101; Osment <i>vs.</i> McElrath, 68 Cal., 466; Knudson <i>vs.</i> Curley, 30 Minn., 433; School District No.&nbsp; 73 <i>vs.</i> Wrabeck, 31 Minn., 77; Downer <i>vs.</i> Sexton, 17 Wis., 29; Badger<i> vs.</i> Daenieke, 56 Wis., 678; McFadden <i>vs.</i> Friendly, 9 Mich., 222; Pollock <i>vs</i>. Pollock, 71 N. Y., 137.)<br><br>The third question to be decided is whether the facts in the&nbsp; complaint are&nbsp; sufficiently&nbsp; stated;&nbsp; in&nbsp; other&nbsp; words, whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.&nbsp; The complaint says:<br><blockquote>"First.&nbsp; That the plaintiff, D. Angel Ortiz, is of full age and a resident of Manila, P.&nbsp; L,&nbsp; and is represented in this Province of Sorsogon, P. I., by D. Eduardo Roteache, of full age and a&nbsp; resident of Sorsogon, Sorsogon, P. I.<br><br>"Second. That the defendant,&nbsp; Ramon Garcia, is of full age and a resident of the municipality of Bacon, Sorsogon, P.I.<br><br>"Third. That the defendant is&nbsp; indebted to the widow and daughters of F. Suarez in the sum of four hundred and ninety-five pesos and thirty-three centavos Philippine currency (P495.33), with interest at 10 per cent per annum from the 17th day of November, 1906, with a mortgage of a house, with its corresponding&nbsp; lot, described as follows: (Here follows a description of the land.)<br><br>"Fourth. That the said&nbsp; debt&nbsp; and mortgage have been transferred by the widow and children of&nbsp; F. Suarez to the plaintiff, D. Angel Ortiz.<br><br>"Fifth.&nbsp; That said mortgage by its terms was to become due on or before one year and six months from the 17th day of November, 1906.<br><br>"Sixth.&nbsp; That said mortgage became due on the 17th day of May, 1908, without the&nbsp; plaintiff having been paid said sum of four hundred and ninety-five pesos and thirty-three centavos, Philippine currency (5M95.33)&nbsp; or the interest at 10 per cent from the 17th day of November, 1906."</blockquote>We are of the opinion that the&nbsp; complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.&nbsp; It is not required in an action of foreclosure to state in detail every fact required by law to make the mortgage valid.&nbsp; The allegation that&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; executed and delivered to the plaintiff a mortgage upon specified property is a sufficient allegation of the validity&nbsp; of the mortgage and of every act required to be done&nbsp; by either party thereto to&nbsp; make that mortgage valid.&nbsp; It is not necessary to allege evidentiary facts.&nbsp;&nbsp; Only ultimate facts should be pleaded.&nbsp; On the trial it is&nbsp; necessary, of course, to prove&nbsp; every fact required to make the mortgage valid and&nbsp; enforceable.&nbsp; We&nbsp; conclude, therefore, that the finding of the court that the facts&nbsp; stated in the complaint had been proved is a sufficient&nbsp; finding of the facts, and as such is adequate to support the decision.<br><br>The judgment of the court below is therefore affirmed with&nbsp; costs against the appellant.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson,</i> and <i>Carson, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="left"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Amended by&nbsp; Act No. 1596.<br></div>
