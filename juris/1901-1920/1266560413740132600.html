				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This defendant was charged with&nbsp; the&nbsp; crime&nbsp; of&nbsp; <em>estafa</em>, alleged to&nbsp; have been committed as follows:<p></p><blockquote>"The said accused (about the 22d of May, 1910), being sergeant of municipal police&nbsp; of the municipality of Sorsogon, P. I., and as&nbsp; such a public officer, did, with&nbsp; abuse of his office, about the 7th to the 22d of May of said year, demand and receive, from Claro Rentoria the sum of P4 for payment of the&nbsp; latter's cedula for the year 1909; and said accused, upon receiving the said sum, instead of purchasing the required cedula for the aggrieved party, appropriated and diverted it to his own use, to the detriment of said Rentoria,&nbsp; and refused to return it or the cedula, although the interested party&nbsp; demanded that he&nbsp; do so; in violation of law."</blockquote><p>After&nbsp; hearing the&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; adduced during the trial of the cause,&nbsp; the Honorable Jose C. Abreu, judge, found&nbsp; the defendant guilty of the crime charged in said complaint and sentenced him to be imprisoned for a period of three months of <em>arresto&nbsp; mayor</em>, with eleven years and&nbsp; one day of disqualification from&nbsp; holding any public office, and to pay the costs.&nbsp; From that sentence the defendant appealed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>After hearing the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Honorable Jose C. Abreu, made the following findings of fact, which we find, upon examination, are fully supported by said evidence:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> "In&nbsp; the month of May,&nbsp; 1910, and for some time prior thereto, the accused was municipal police sergeant of Sorsogon.&nbsp;&nbsp; As such police officer he was ordered&nbsp; to arrest all persons delinquent in the payment of their personal cedulas. Upon arresting the delinquents and taking them to the city hall, the accused was in the habit of receiving from them various sums of money wherewith to pay their cedula taxes, issuing receipts to&nbsp; the persons who thus delivered money to him.&nbsp; Once&nbsp; he turned into the&nbsp; treasury P50, which he received in the manner before stated, with a list of the persons to whom cedulas were to be issued in exchange for the receipts issued&nbsp; by him.</p><p> "One Claro Rentoria,&nbsp; who was arrested in the barrio of Guinlajon for&nbsp; not&nbsp; having&nbsp; a&nbsp; cedula, upon&nbsp; being&nbsp; taken to the house of the lieutenant of the barrio,&nbsp; there delivered to the accused the sum of two pesos wherewith to get a cedula for the year 1909, which said Rentoria had not yet bought, the latter promising&nbsp; to&nbsp; deliver later on two&nbsp; more&nbsp; pesos, for he was obliged to&nbsp; pay&nbsp; the penalty for&nbsp; delinquency. This took place on May 7, 1910,&nbsp; and on May 22 the said Rentoria delivered the two pesos remaining to be paid to complete the sum required for the purchase of his cedula for the year 1909.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the&nbsp; accused did not&nbsp; turn&nbsp; in this amount with the P50 before mentioned nor did he get Claro Rentoria's&nbsp; cedula for the year 1909, nor did he return to the latter the said&nbsp; sum, notwithstanding the repeated demands made upon him for the delivery&nbsp; of the cedula or the return of the money.&nbsp; Only&nbsp; some time in&nbsp; October or November, 1910, after it had been discovered that the accused was collecting money without authority from&nbsp; various persons for the payment of their respective cedulas, and after several complaints had been made against him to the captain of the&nbsp; Constabulary,&nbsp; who in&nbsp; turn&nbsp; submitted the matter to the provincial governor, in accordance with the first provision of Act No. 610, did the accused deposit in the keeping of a clerk of&nbsp; the&nbsp; municipal treasury of Sorsogon the said sum of four pesos, instead of returning it to Rentoria."</p></blockquote><p> The appellant attempts to show in his brief that the crime described in the complaint and proven during the trial, does not constitute the crime of <em>estafa.</em><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>We think that the facts proven clearly constitute a violation of paragraph 5 of article 535 of the Penal Code, and that the defendant is guilty of the crime charged in the complaint.&nbsp; The sentence of the lower court is therefore hereby affirmed, with costs.<br>&nbsp; <br><em>Arellano,&nbsp; C. J., Mapa, Carson</em>, and <em>Trent,&nbsp; JJ</em>,, concur.<br></p></div>
