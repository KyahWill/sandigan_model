				<h4>
				G.R. No. 1070, February 28, 1903</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE, VS. PABLO JUDIT, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>LADD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> The evidence shows that the defendant and his brother were fighting and making a disturbance in their house, that the complaining witness, Apinan, an elderly man, reproved them, whereupon the defendant, incensed by  the rebuke, bit  off a part of one of Apinan's ears.</p>
<p> The loss of a portion of an ear constitutes a deformity within  the meaning of  article  416,  No. 3, of the Code. (Judgment in cassation of October 28, 1887.)</p>
<p> The conviction was right;  the penalty, in the absence of either extenuating or aggravating circumstances, was properly applied in the medium grade, the indemnification was fixed at an appropriate sum, and the judgment is therefore affirmed in all  respects.  Let the cause be returned to the court below for the execution of the judgment.</p>
<p> <em>Arellano, C. J., Cooper, Willard,</em> and <em>Mapa, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p> <em>Torres, J.,</em> did not sit in this case.</p>
