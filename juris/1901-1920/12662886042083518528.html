				G.R. No. 9291, March 02, 1914</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. CAMILA CUNANAN, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>TRENT, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal by the defendant, Camila Cunanan, from a judgment of the 
Court of First Instance of Tarlac, condemning her to fifteen years imprisonment 
in Bilibid, to indemnify the injured party, and to pay the costs of the case, 
for the crime of frustrated parricide.<br><p><br>The evidence of record establishes 
beyond a reasonable doubt the guilt of the appellant of the crime charged. The 
penalty imposed is not in accordance with the law and the facts in the case. The 
information charges that the crime was committed with treachery. Treachery not 
being an element of the crime of frustrated parricide it must be taken as a 
generic aggravating circumstance. (U. S. <em>vs.</em> Villanueva, 2 Phil. Rep., 
61.) There being no extenuating circumstances the maximum degree of the penalty 
must be imposed in accordance with articles 65 and 95 of the Penal Code.</p>
<p>The judgment is therefore modified by substituting seventeen years four 
months and one day of <em>reclusion temporal, </em>for the fifteen years imposed 
by the court. The appellant in also condemned to suffer the accessory penalties 
provided by law. In all other respects the judgment is affirmed.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Carson, Moreland,</em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.,</em> 
concur.</p>
