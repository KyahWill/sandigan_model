				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. FRANCISCO CASTRO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The accused in this case is charged with the falsification of a private document in  that on or  about the 25th day of February, 1903, he (signed the name of one Eegino Sevilla, deceased, to a certain bill of sale of a boat or <em>barangay</em>, the property of the estate of the said Sevilla.</p>
<p>Evidence was introduced at the trial strongly tending to prove that the accused did in fact attach the signature of Regino Sevilla to the document in question for the purpose of defrauding Sevilla's heirs and  depriving them of their property in the said boat.  It does not appear, however, that any attempt  was made to simulate the genuine signature, and there is evidence of record that Sevilla himself did not know how to write or even to sign his own name. This court, adopting the doctrine laid down by the supreme court of Spain, has frequently held that upon a charge of falsification  by attaching  the signature of  another to a written document conviction  can not  be had unless it appears that an attempt has been made to simulate the genuine signature of that person; and, therefore, while the accused may have been guilty of the crime of <em>estafa</em> or one of its allied offenses, he can not be convicted of the crime offalsification of a private document as charged in the information  and as  defined and penalized in article 304, taken  in  relation with article 300  of the Penal  Code. (Decisions of the  supreme court of Spain, December 27, 1882, and April 15, 1885; U. S. <em>vs</em>. Paraiso, 1 Phil. Rep., 66; U. S. <em>vs</em>. Roque, id., 372; U. S. <em>vs</em>. Buenaventura, id., 428.)</p>
<p>The accused is acquitted of the crime with which he is charged and the judgment and  sentence appealed, from is reversed  with the  costs of both instances <em>de  oficio</em>.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J.,  Torres, Mapa, Johnson,</em> and <em>Willard, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
