				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This was a petition for the writ of <i>certiorari,</i> presented in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Pampanga, on the 29th of October, 1912.&nbsp; To the petition the defendants duly&nbsp; answered.<br><br>After hearing the respective parties, the Honorable Julio Llorente,&nbsp; judge, rendered the following decision upon&nbsp; the questions&nbsp; presented:<br><br>"Section 217 of Act No.. 190 provides as follows:<br><blockquote>" 'When the ground of the complaint in an&nbsp; action&nbsp; in a Court of First Instance is that an inferior tribunal, board, or officer exercising judicial&nbsp; functions, has&nbsp; exceeded&nbsp; the jurisdiction of such tribunal, board,&nbsp; or officer, and there is no appeal, nor&nbsp; any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy, and the court, on trial, finds the&nbsp; allegations of the complaint to be true, it shall render a judgment ordering such inferior tribunal,&nbsp; board, or officer, or&nbsp; other person having the custody&nbsp; of the record or proceedings, at a specified time&nbsp; and place, to certify to the court a transcript of the record&nbsp; and the proceedings&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; that the same may be reviewed by the court; etc.'<br></blockquote>"According to the law,&nbsp; it is therefore necessary, in order that a writ of certiorari may issue, that the inferior court, board, or officer have exceeded his jurisdiction.&nbsp; The provincial board of Pampanga, in annulling&nbsp; the resolution passed by the municipal council of San Fernando, mentioned in the complaint, did not exceed its jurisdiction.&nbsp; Section 5 of Act&nbsp; No. 1791 confers power upon the provincial board to approve all acts, ordinances, resolutions and orders which are within the&nbsp; powers conferred upon the council or the municipal president, and to declare null and void such as are not within said powers.&nbsp; Whether the provincial board of Pampanga&nbsp; erred or not in annulling the resolution&nbsp; of the municipal&nbsp; council of San&nbsp; Fernando, by ordering a new auction sale, such&nbsp; error, if&nbsp; committed,&nbsp; can be&nbsp; corrected by an appeal,&nbsp; but does not&nbsp; warrant the issuance&nbsp; of a writ of certiorari.<br><blockquote>"The writ of certiorari&nbsp; prayed&nbsp; for, is&nbsp; denied.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered."<br></blockquote>From that decision the defendants appealed to this court. The only question presented by the appellant is one relating to the jurisdiction&nbsp; of the provincial board in annulling a resolution of the municipal council.<br><br>Without discussing in detail,&nbsp; at this&nbsp; time, the question presented, we are of the opinion and so hold that the conclusions reached by the lower court are in conformity with the law.&nbsp; Its judgment is therefore hereby affirmed,&nbsp; with costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano,&nbsp; C. J., Torres, </i>and<i> Araullo, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><i>Trent, J., </i>dissents.</div>
