				G.R. No. 3860, February 05, 1908</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. FAUSTINO TREMOYA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT <BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>TRACEY, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In the Court of First Instance of Ambos Camarines the appellant was convicted of <i>coaccion</i> and sentenced to two months and one day of <i>arresto mayor</i> and a fine of 325 pesetas and the accessories, together&nbsp; with the restitution of the hemp taken by him, and the costs of the action.<br><br>Faustino Tremoya and Gregorio Tremoya, brothers, on the one side and Santiago Pu単ado on the other were adverse claimants to a parcel of hemp land which, in company with four workmen, the accused visited and, finding Prudencio and Aniceto Rodriguez cutting hemp there, ordered them to desist.&nbsp; Thereupon there arose a dispute, during which Prudencio Rodriguez showed a bolo and the accused drew his revolver and pointed it at him, threatening that if he did not get out he would fire upon him&nbsp; and his companions.&nbsp; They took themselves off and left Tremoya and his&nbsp; party in possession of the hemp.<br><br>The two Rodriguez were employed by Pu単ado and this fact, and the claim of their owner, must have been known to tie accused, for the reason that some time before they had been arrested at the instance of his brother for stealing hemp from this lot,&nbsp; but on trial had been acquitted by the justice of the peace on the ground that, being mere employees of Santiago Pu単ado, they acted by his orders. It is plain that Pu単ado and his men were in possession of this land under claim of right and that the remedy of the accused was to assert his title, if any, in the courts and not by forcible dispossession.&nbsp; The violence and intimidation which he exercised to drive them off and obtain possession of the hemp against their will constitute the offense of <i>coaccion</i> as denned in article 497 of he Penal Code. We find no error in the judgment of the court below, which is affirmed with costs of this instance.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano,&nbsp; C. J., Torres, Mapa,&nbsp; Johnson,&nbsp; Carson, </i> and <i>Willard, JJ.,</i> concur. </div>
