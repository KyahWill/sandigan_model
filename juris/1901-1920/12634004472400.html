				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>In  a written  complaint filed on  the 12th  of October, 1904, by Attorney  Wade H.  Kitchens, in behalf of  Agatona, Victor, Anacleto, and  Juana Tuason, in the Court of  First  Instance  of  Pangasinan, the  plaintiffs to  this action prayed that judgment be rendered therein declaring that the house and lot referred to in the complaint as being situated on Calle San Vicente,  in the town of Lingayen,  Province  of Pangasinan, belonged to  them,  and that they  were  entitled  to the possession of  the same; and that the defendants Ignacia Uson be directed to  pay to them P1,550 as  damages for the wrongful use and occupation of  the premises, and costs of the suit, alleging in support thereof  that they were the owners of the said house and lot bounded on the north by Calle San Vicente, on  the  east by  the lot  of the heirs of Wenceslao Puson, on  the  south by the Agno River, and  on the west by the lot  of Leoncia George; that in 1898,  while  they wore in possession of the property, the defendant  entered  upon the same unlawfully and has continued in  the wrongful possession thereof depriving the plaintiffs of the use and enjoyment of the premises; and that on account of this wrongful possession of the defendant,  the plaintiffs have suffered damages  to  the extent  of P1,550,  Philippine currency.</p>
<p>The defendant ignacia Uson filed an answer to the said complaint  through her attorney Isabelo Artacho, wherein she denied each and all  the allegations of  the said complaint, Hotting up as a special defense that  the defendant and her minor children Rafael and Antonio Uson were the owners of the property described in the complaint.</p>
<p>After the testimony introduced by both parties had been taken and  the documentary proof  had  been  joined to the record, the court directed counsel  for plaintiffs to amend his said  complaint so as  to  conform with the facts established at the trial, and  the complaint was amended as follows:</p>
<p>That in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the complaint the figures representing  the year 1898 be changed  to read 1900; that the receipt which the defendant had in her possession for the sum of 200 pesos, alleged  to  have been received  by Agatona Tun son from Vicente  Puson in 1893, as an advance  payment on  the purchase price  of the  house, was. false  as  it was not signed either by Agatona Tuason or her nephew;  that  the receipt signed by  Agatona Tuason for the sum of 70 pesos, delivered to her by Ignacia Uson,. was for the accumulated rents for the said house and that it  was false  that the said sum represented  the purchase price  of the house and  lot referred  to; that Anacleto Tuason, who signed a receipt for 30 pesos delivered  to him by Ignacia Uson, had nothing to do with and knew nothing of the alleged sale of the said house and lot, he having signed the receipt by order of the  defendant without the knowledge or consent of the other plaintiffs, who  did not receive any part of the aforesaid amount of 30 pesos j wherefore,  the plaintiffs  prayed that the receipt  for 200 pesos  alleged to have been signed  by Agatona Tuason  in 1893 be declared false; thai; it be  adjudged that the 70 pesos referred to in the receipt signed in 1900 by Tuason in favor of Ignacia Uson represented accumulated rent due for the use and occupation of  the property, and not an advance payment on the purchase price of the  property; and that the receipt for 30 pesos signed by Anacleto Tuason in favor of the defendant be declared void  in so far as it relates to the sale of  the said house and lot.</p>
<p>In view of the evidence the court below  rendered judgment, December 28, 1904, declaring that Agatona Tuason and her coplaintiffs were  the lawful owners of  the house and lot involved  in this case and directed the defendant, Ignacia Uson, to turn over the possession  of the same to the plaintiffs and pay to  them the sum of P280, Philippine currency, for the use and occupation of said premises, with the costs of proceedings.  The  defendant excepted to this judgment, and moved for a new trial on the ground that the judgment of  the court below  was not justified by the evidence, it being contrary to law, which said motion was overruled, the defendant having excepted to  the order of the court overruling the same.</p>
<p>In order to  decide  this case properly and justly it becomes necessary: to take as a starting point the  main and all important  fact established by  the evidence that the house and  lot in  question belonged to Agatona Tuason and her brothers, one  of whom was the father of the other plaintiff  to  this action.   It was so admitted by the defendant, Ignacia Uson, in her affidavits appearing on pages 1 and 34 to 38 of the  record.</p>
<p>The defendant, however, denied the  facts alleged by the plaintiffs and that she occupied the premises as  a tenant, and insisted that she and her minor children are  the owners of the said house and  lot,  she and her deceased husband, Vicente Puson,  during his lifetime, having acquired the  same  in or prior to the year  1885, under  a verbal  contract of purchase.</p>
<p>It is a settled principle  of law that  the burden of proof lies with the person making the allegation, and this principle is recognized in article 1214 of the Civil Code. Section 297 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Each party must prove his own affirmative allegations. Evidence need not be given in support of a negative allegation except when such negative allegation is an essential part of the statement  of  the right or title on which the cause of action or defense is  founded, nor even in such case when the allegation is  a denial of  the existence of a  document, the custody of which belongs to the opposite party."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It having  been admitted  that  the plaintiffs were the original owners  of the  property in question, in order that the defendant may prevail in this action it is absolutely necessary for her to prove in a satisfactory manner that she is in possession of the said property as owner of the same and that she acquired  or  purchased it from the real owner.  This she  must establish  by competent proof in accordance with law.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs allege that the defendant, Ignacia Uson, is in possession  of the said house and lot in  the same capacity as she and her  husband,  during the latter's lifetime, occupied the same, that is to say as tenants, by virtue of a lease executed in or prior to the year 1885, at the rate of 4 pesos per month, the  lease  being for an indefinite period. We shall now ascertain what the real facts are in the case, whether the  defendant purchased the  property  or  held the same under a lease.</p>
<p>Exhibit H, which is a document executed on the 29th of March, 1893, does not show that the owners of the  property in  question sold the  same to  Vicente  Puson,  the deceased husband  of the defendant.   Agatona Ttiason and the witness Leoncia George denied the authenticity of the signatures  appearing on the said document purporting to be theirs.   We can not therefore infer from the said  document the existence of the alleged contract of sale.</p>
<p>Vicente Puson, the deceased  husband of  the defendant, in his lifetime seems to have been very careful when  he drew up the  document marked "Exhibit B," showing the payment to Agatona Tuason of the  sum of 200 pesos,  as part of the purchase price, in 1893.  It is difficult, therefore, to explain why  he was  so careless as to draw up the alleged bill of sale of the property in question on an ordinary piece of paper.</p>
<p>The statement of Agatona Tuason  to the effect that she did not receive the 200 pesos referred to and did not sign the document marked "Exhibit B" is not contradicted or in any way affected by her subsequent admission that she received from the defendant  the sum of  70 pesos as rent for the use  and occupation of the property in  question. This admission on the part of Agatona that she received this sum of 70 pesos in payment of the rent for the premises is the best evidence of her good faith and  in the absence of proof to the effect that the house and lot in question were purchased by  the defendant and that the  signature of Agatona Tuason appearing on Exhibit B is authentic, we must necessarily conclude that she received the 70 pesos in payment  of the rent  of the  said house and lot,  and not as a partial  payment of the purchase price on the alleged contract of sale, defendant's contention to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>
<p>Even if the document marked "Exhibit  B" were rejected in its entirety, yet there is sufficient proof to show that the defendant Ignacia Uson  now  occupies the premises  as a tenant that is to say, in the same capacity in which she and her deceased husband, Vicente Puson, occupied it during the latter's lifetimeâ€”and not as the owner  of the property.  Exhibit  C is  not sufficient to  show  that the defendant was the owner of the property,  especially as the plaintiff, Agatona, denied the sale and the defendant has failed to establish this very important fact in a manner that would  justify a judgment in  her  favor.  Antonia Nable Jose,  a witness for the defendant,  testified that he was appointed  the  executor  of the  will  alleged to  have been left by Vicente Puson, and that the deceased  made reference to  the said house and lot in his said will.  The fact, however,  that he  may have even  disposed of the property as though he were the owner of the same, as contended by the defendant,  is not sufficient to show that the property actually belonged to him.   Moreover,  the will in question was not introduced in evidence.</p>
<p>Nazario del Castillo likewise testified that Vicente Puson left a will  which was  forwarded by the local president, Francisco Castro, to the <em>consejero de justicia</em> of the province; that he did not know the present whereabouts of the said will, and that he had no recollection as to whether the testator had disposed of  the property in question by the said will.   This  witness further testified that Wenceslao Puson, a brother of the deceased Vicente Puson, told him, the witness, that the house and lot in question belonged to the plaintiff, Agatona Tuason, and that  he being then the municipal president of  the  town, attempted  to settle this matter between the parties but without success for the reason that  Ignicia Uson  refused to accept the proposition made to her by Agatona Tuason, notwithstanding the fact that her brother-in-law, Wenceslao Puson, who knew that the property belonged to the  latter, advised her to do it. He? further  testified that he had seen receipts  for certain amounts paid by the  deceased,  Vicente Puson, as rent, which  said  receipts were then  in the possession  of  the plaintiff.</p>
<p>In addition to  the plaintiffs Agatona  Tuason and Anacleto Tnason, who testified at the trial under oath,  the witnesses Victorina Puson, Francisco Orozco,  Clara Manuel, and Leoncia Tuason swore that the defendant Ignacia Puson  occupied  the property in question as  a tenant. These  witnesses all testified to the same effect upon this point,  and there being nothing in the record to overcome their testimony,  there  is no  doubt  that the capacity  in which  the defendant occupied the premises, to wit, as a tenant, has been fully established.</p>
<p>If the defendant had  set up as a defense that plaintiffs action was  barred by  the statute of limitations, such a defense would not have  been sustained for the reason  that she did not occupy the property in question under a claim of title.</p>
<p>As to the damages sought to be recovered for  the wrongful occupation of the premises in question, article 1556 of the Civil Code provides  among other things that the lessee who does not comply with the obligation imposed upon him either  by law  or  by the terms of his lease shall be liable for  the losses  and  damages incurred by the  lessor on account thereof.</p>
<p>For the reasons hereinbefore set out we art1 of the opinion that the judgment of the court  below  should be, and it is hereby, affirmed, with the costs against the appellant, the defendant only to pay to the plaintiffs the sum  of 4  pesos per  month, as rent  for the  use and  occupation of  the premises,  from the 28th of October, 1903, until  the plaintiffs recovered  the possession thereof.  After the expiration of twenty days from the date hereof,  let judgment be entered in accordance herewith  and the case remanded in due time to the court below for execution.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Carson, Willard,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em>Arellano C. J.,</em> and <em>Mapa, J.,</em> dissent.</p>
<p><em>Johnson, J.,</em> did not sit in this case.<br>
