				<H3>GREGORIO JIMENEZ, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. PEDRO RABOT, NICOLASA JIMENEZ AND HER HUSBAND, EMILIO RODRIGUEZ, DEFENDANTS. PEDRO RABOT, APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>STREET, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This action was instituted by the plaintiff, Gregorio Jimenez, to recover 
from the defendant, Pedro Rabot, a parcel of land situated in the municipality 
of Alaminos, in the Province of Pangasinan, and described in the complaint as 
follows:
<p>"Approximate area of three hectares; bounded on the north and west with land 
of Pedro Reynoso; on the south with land of Nicolasa Jimenez; and on the east 
with land of Calixta Apostol before, at present with that of Juan Montemayor and 
Simon del Barrio. It is situated in Dinmayat Tancaran, barrio of Alos of this 
same municipality of Alaminos, Pangasinan."</p>
<p>From a judgment rendered in favor of the plaintiff, Pedro Rabot has appealed; 
but his codefendants, Nicolasa Jimenez and her husband, who were cited by the 
defendant for the purpose of holding her liable upon her warranty in case of his 
eviction, have not appealed.</p>
<p>It is admitted that the parcel of land in question, together with two other 
parcels in the same locality originally belonged to the plaintiff, having been 
assigned to him as one of the heirs in the division of the estate of his father. 
It further appears that while Gregorio was staying at Vigan, in the Province of 
Ilocos Sur, during the year 1911, his property in Alaminos was confided by him 
to the care of his elder sister Nicolasa Jimenez. On February 7 of that year he 
wrote this sister a letter from Vigan in which he informed her that he was 
pressed for money and requested her to sell one of his parcels of land and send 
him the money in order that he might pay his debts. This letter contains no 
description of the land to be sold other than is indicated in the words "one of 
my parcels of land" ("uno de mis terrenos").</p>
<p>Acting upon this letter Nicolasa approached the defendant Pedro Rabot, and 
the latter agreed to buy the parcel in question for the sum of P500. Two hundred 
and fifty pesos were paid at once, with the understanding that a deed of 
conveyance would be executed when the balance should be paid Nicolasa admits 
having received this payment of 9250 at the time stated; but there is no 
evidence that she sent any of it to her brother.</p>
<p>About one year later Gregorio came down to Alaminos and demanded that his 
sister should surrender this piece of land to him, it being then in her 
possession. She refused upon some pretext or other to do so; and as a result 
Gregorio, in conjunction with others of his brothers, and sisters, whose 
properties were also in the hands of Nicolasa, instituted an action in the Court 
of First Instance for the purpose of recovering their land from her control. 
This action was decided favorably to the plaintiffs upon August 12, 1913; and no 
appeal was taken from the judgment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, upon May 31,1912, Nicolasa Jimenez executed and delivered to Pedro 
Rabot a deed purporting to convey to him the parcel of land which is the subject 
of this controversy. The deed recites that the sale was made in consideration of 
the sum of P500, the payment of which is acknowledged. Pedro Rabot went into 
possession, and the property was found in his hands at the time when final 
judgment was entered in favor of the plaintiffs in the action above mentioned. 
It will thus be seen that Pedro Rabot acquired possession under the deed from 
Nicolasa during the pendency of the litigation in which she was defendant; but 
it does not positively appear that he was at the time cognizant of that 
circumstance.</p>
<p>In considering the questions presented by this appeal one or two preliminary 
observations may be made. The first is that, as a matter of formality, a power 
of attorney to convey real property ought to appear in a public document, just 
as any other instrument intended to transmit or convey an interest in such 
property ought to appear in a public document. (Art. 1280, Civil Code.) But 
inasmuch as it is an established doctrine that a private document is competent 
to create, transmit, modify, or extinguish a right in real property (Thunga Chui 
<em>vs</em>. Que Bentec, 2 Phil. Rep., 561; Couto Soriano <em>vs</em>. Cortes, 8 
Phil. Rep., 459), it follows that a power of attorney to convey such property, 
even though in the form of a private document, will operate with effect. Again, 
supposing that the letter contained adequate authority for Nicolasa to sell the 
property in question, her action in conveying the property in her own name, 
without showing the capacity in which she acted, was doubtless irregular. 
Nevertheless, such deed would in any event operate to bind her brother, the 
plaintiff, in its character as a contract (Lyon <em>vs</em>. Pollock, 99 U. S., 
668; 25 L. ed., 265), and supposing that the authority was sufficient, he could 
be compelled by a proper judicial proceeding to execute a document to carry such 
contract into effect. (Art. 1279, Civil Code.)</p>
<p>The principal question for consideration therefore in the end resolves itself 
into this, whether the authority conferred on Nicolasa by the letter of February 
7, 1911, was sufficient to' enable her to bind her brother. The only provisions 
of law bearing on this point are contained in article 1713 of the Civil Code and 
in section 335 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Article 1713 of the Civil Code 
requires that the authority to alienate land shall be contained in an express 
mandate; while subsection 5 of section 335 of the Code of Civil Procedure says 
that the authority of the agent must be in writing and subscribed by the party 
to be charged. We are of the opinion that the authority expressed in the letter 
is a sufficient compliance with both requirements.</p>
<p>It has been urged here that in order for the authority to be sufficient under 
section 335 of the Code of Civil Procedure the authorization must contain a 
particular description of the property which the agent is to be permitted to 
sell. There is no such requirement in subsection 5 of section 335; and we do not 
believe that it would be legitimate to read such a requirement into it. The 
purpose in giving a power of attorney is to substitute the mind and hand of the 
agent for the mind and hand of the principal; and if the character and extent of 
the power is so far defined as to leave no doubt as to the limits within which 
the agent is authorized to act, and he acts within those limits, the principal 
cannot question the validity of his act. It is not necessary that the particular 
act to be accomplished should be predestinated by the language of the power. The 
ques^ tion to be answered always, after the power has been exercised, is rather 
this: Was the act which the agent performed within the scope of his authority? 
In the case before us, if the question is asked whether the act performed by 
Nicolasa Jimenez was within the scope of the authority which had been conferred 
upon her, the answer must be obviously in the affirmative.</p>
<p>It should not escape observation that the problem with which we are here 
concerned relates to the sufficiency of the power of attorney under subsection 5 
of section 335 of the Code of Civil Procedure and not to the sufficiency of the 
note or memorandum of the contract, or agreement of sale, required by the same 
subsection, in connection with the first paragraph of the same section. It is 
well settled in the jurisprudence of England and the United States that when the 
owner, or his agent, comes to make a contract to sell, or a conveyance to effect 
a transfer, there must be a description of the property which is the subject of 
the sale or conveyance. This is necessary of course to define the object of the 
contract. (Brockway <em>vs</em>. Frost, 40 Minn., 155; Carr <em>vs</em>. Passaic 
Land etc. Co., 19 N. J. Eq., 424; Lippincott <em>vs</em>. Bridgewater, 55 N. J. 
Eq., 208; Craig <em>vs</em>. Zelian, 137 Cal., 105; 20 Cyc, 271.)</p>
<p>The general rule here applicable is that the description must be sufficiently 
definite to identify the land either from the recitals of the contract or deed 
or from external facts referred to in the document, thereby enabling one to 
determine the identity of the lana and if the description is uncertain on its 
face or is shown to be applicable with equal plausibility to more than one 
tract, it is insufficient. The principle embodied in these decisions is not, in 
our opinion, applicable to the present case, which relates to the sufficiency of 
the authorization, not to the sufficiency of the contract or conveyance. It is 
unquestionable that the deed which Nicolasa executed contains a proper 
description of the property which she purported to convey.</p>
<p>There is ample authority to the effect that a person may by a general power 
of attorney authorize an agent to sell "all" the land possessed by the 
principal, or all that he possesses in a particular city, county, or state. 
(Roper <em>vs</em>. McFadden, 48 Cal., 346; Rownd <em>vs</em>. Davidson, 113 
La., 1047; Carson <em>vs</em>. Ray, 52 N. C, 609; 78 Am. Dec, 267; 31 Cyc, 
1229.) It is also held that where a person authorizes an agent to sell a farm 
("my farm") in a certain county, this is sufficient, if it be shown that such 
party has only one farm in that county. (Marriner <em>vs</em>. Dennison, 78 
Cal., 202.) In Linton <em>vs</em>. Moorhead (209 Pa. St., 646), the power 
authorized the agent to sell or convey "any or all tracts, lots, or parcels" of 
land belonging to the plaintiff. It was held that this was adequate. In Lyon 
<em>vs</em>. Pollock (99 U. S., 668), the owner in effect authorized an agent to 
sell everything he had in San Antonio, Texas. The authority was held sufficient. 
In Liñan <em>vs</em>. Puno (31 Phil. Rep., 259), the authority granted was to 
the effect that the agent might administer "the interests" possessed by the 
principal in the municipality of Tarlac and to that end he was authorized to 
purchase, sell, collect, and pay, etc. It was held that this was a sufficient 
power.</p>
<p>In the present case the agent was given the power to sell either of the 
parcels of land belonging to the plaintiff. We can see no reason why the 
performance of an act within the scope of this authority should not bind the 
plaintiff to the same extent as if he had given the agent authority to sell "any 
or all" and she had conveyed only one.</p>
<p>From what has been said it is evident that the lower court should have 
absolved the defendant Pedro Rabot from the complaint. Judgment will accordingly 
be reversed, without any express adjudication of costs of this instance. So 
ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Johnson, Malcolm, Avanceña</em>, and <em>Fisher, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p></div>
