				<BR><STRONG>MAPA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The conclusion reached by the  court below with respect to the sufficiency of the evidence as to the commission  of the act charged, and the guilt  of  the defendants as principals, is in conformity with th,e law.   The offense has been properly classified in the judgment as that of robbery with homicide, denned and punished in section 1 of article 503 of the Penal Code. The judge has imposed upon the defendants the penalty of death, considering the  concurrence, in  the commission of the crime, of  the aggravating circumstances of <em>aleviosa</em>, premeditation,  and the perpetration  of the offense in an uninhabited place.  We can not concur in this conclusion. No witness was present at  the commission of  the crime, and therefore no one can testify  from his own knowledge as to  the manner and form  in which the crime  was committed.   These  data being absent, there is no foundation upon which to rest the  circumstance of <em>alevosia</em>, which is, in its essential  characteristics, a  modifying condition  in the commission of the crime.   It can not even be presumed that the  defendants tied  the hands of the  deceased—and this is apparently the fact upon which the judge relied for the purpose  of considering that this  circumstance  was present—because the vague indications which appear in the record to have been made upon this point as a mere matter of hearsay are overcome by the certain and unquestionable fact that the deceased crawled on his hands and knees some 300 meters from the place where the crime was committed to the police station, where he Avas found wounded by the people of  the barrio in which the crime occurred.   This proves positively that his hands were free and not tied. This conclusion is  corroborated by the circumstance that none of the various witnesses.who saw him in the station could testify to the contrary at the trial.</p>
<p>With respect  to premeditation, there are no data whatever to <em>show</em> when the idea of killing and robbing the deceased first arose in the minds of  the accused.  This idea might well have occurred to them at the very moment they met him in the place where the crime was committed.   This mooting, in accordance with all conjectures possible upon the record of the case, was casual,  and therefore it can not be affirmed, because of the lack of any evidence, that the commission of the crime was  preceded by a reflexive and premeditated purpose or intent, this being precisely what constitutes premeditation.  In consequence,  we hold that this circumstance did not exist in this case.</p>
<p>With respect to the circumstance of the commission of the crime  in  an uninhabited  place,  we  do not find this circumstance sufficiently proven in the case, in consideration of the fact that a short distance from the place where the crime was committed there was a station, the precise purpose of which was to serve as a shelter for the peace officers of the town.  On the other hand, it does not appear that when the offense in the  case at bar was committed there wore no watchmen at the station; therefore it can not be said,  strictly speaking, that the place in question was an uninhabited, solitary place, and that its isolation made it easy to  commit the crime with  impunity.  This is the very el onion t upon which rests the increased responsibility for crimes committed in uninhabited places.</p>
<p>There being no aggravating circumstance which can be considered to have concurred  in the commission of the crime, the accused should be convicted, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2  of article 80 of the Penal Code, to suffer the  lesser of the two  indivisible penalties prescribed by paragraph 1 of article 503, which, as we have already stated, is the one applicable to the case.</p>
<p>We therefore condemn the accused to the penalty of life imprisonment (<em>cadena perpetua</em>)  and to the payment  of the sum of 500 Mexican pesos to the heirs of the deceased. The judgment of the court below, so modified, is affirmed, Avith the  costs  of  this instance to the defendants.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Cooper, Willard,</em> and Ladd, JJ., concur.<br>
