				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The purpose of the present action was to obtain possession of a small tract or parcel of land which is particularly described in paragraph&nbsp; 2 of the complaint.&nbsp;&nbsp; The plaintiff prays for the possession&nbsp; of the land,&nbsp; as owner, together with the sum of P200, as damages for the illegal detention thereof.&nbsp; The plaintiff claims that he is the&nbsp; owner of the land in question by virtue&nbsp; of the fact&nbsp; that&nbsp; he purchased the same at sheriff's&nbsp; sale, under an&nbsp; execution against the original owners, on the 16th of June, 1911.&nbsp; The defendant claims that he is the owner of the land in question by virtue of a deed of sale executed and delivered to him by the original owners, on the 18th of&nbsp; May, 1911.<br><br>After&nbsp; hearing the evidence adduced&nbsp; during the&nbsp; trial of the cause, the Honorable Percy&nbsp; M. Moir, judge, found that the defendant was the owner of the land in question and rendered a judgment relieving him from all liability under the complaint.<br><br>From that judgment the plaintiff appealed to this court. From an examination of the record, we think the following facts are proved by&nbsp; a large preponderance of&nbsp; the evidence:<br><br>First.&nbsp; That some time prior&nbsp; to&nbsp; the 18th&nbsp; of May,&nbsp; 1911, an action was commenced in the court of the&nbsp; justice of the peace of the municipality of Malinao, by Chino Co Singo against Quirino Austero and his&nbsp; wife, Januaria Ciencia, for a sum of money.<br><br>Second. That on the 18th of May, 1911, the said justice of the peace rendered a judgment&nbsp; in favor of the plaintiff in said cause and against the defendants, for said&nbsp; sum&nbsp; of money.<br><br>Third. That an execution was issued upon&nbsp; said judgment and was placed in the hands of the&nbsp; sheriff who, at public auction on the 16th of June, 1911, sold to the plaintiff herein the land in question, for the sum of P244.18.<br><br>Fourth. That the original owners&nbsp; (Quirino Austero and his wife, Januaria Ciencia)&nbsp; not having redeemed the land in question within a period of twelve months, said sheriff, on the 7th of August, 1912, issued to the plaintiff herein a certificate of sale.<br><br>Fifth. That on the 18th of May, 1911, Januaria Ciencia, together with her husband, Quirino Austero, sold to the defendant herein the land in question for the purpose of paying a debt&nbsp; which the defendant herein&nbsp; held against them.&nbsp;&nbsp; The deed of sale was executed and delivered on the 18th of May, 1911.&nbsp; The same was acknowledged before a notary public on the 12th of October, 1911.<br><br>Sixth. That at the time of the sale of the land in question at public auction,&nbsp; on&nbsp; the 16th of June,&nbsp; 1911, the&nbsp; sheriff was notified that the land did not belong to the said Quirino Austero and Januaria Ciencia, and that the same had been sold to the defendant herein, Bruno Monjardin.<br><br>Seventh. That at the&nbsp; time of the&nbsp; sale&nbsp; to the&nbsp; defendant herein&nbsp; (May 18, 1911)&nbsp; the said Quirino&nbsp; Austero and his wife, Januaria Ciencia, were the owners of other property.<br><br>Eighth. That&nbsp; on the 18th&nbsp; of May,&nbsp; 1911, at the time the land in question was sold by Quirino&nbsp; Austero and his wife, Januaria Ciencia, to the&nbsp; defendant herein,&nbsp; the former were legally indebted&nbsp; to the latter in the sum of P800, and that the sale of the land was made for the purpose&nbsp; of paying said indebtedness.<br><br>The&nbsp; plaintiff-appellant alleges that the lower court committed an error in deciding that&nbsp; the sale from Quirino Austero and Januaria Ciencia to the&nbsp; defendant herein was not a fraudulent sale.&nbsp; In reply to that contention, it may be said, in addition to the argument presented by the appellee in his brief, that&nbsp; the plaintiff neither&nbsp; alleged nor attempted to prove fraud, in relation to&nbsp; the&nbsp; transfer&nbsp; of the land in question.&nbsp; Of course, in the absence of an allegation of fraud in the complaint, the plaintiff could not prove it&nbsp; if proper&nbsp; objection were made.&nbsp;&nbsp; While perhaps&nbsp; there may be&nbsp; a presumption&nbsp; of&nbsp; fraud&nbsp; (art. 1297, Civil&nbsp; Code) arising from the nature and character of the transfer or sale, yet, nevertheless, it is a rebuttable presumption and it may be shown that the same was made for a valuable consideration and in good faith.&nbsp; Granting that the&nbsp; appellant properly alleged fraud, we are of the opinion that even in that case, the proof adduced by the defendant shows, beyond question, that the&nbsp; sale was a bona fide sale and that Qurino Austero and Januaria Ciencia had other&nbsp; property, free from encumbrance,&nbsp; subject to execution.<br><br>In view of all of the facts of the record&nbsp; and considering that the defendant was a purchaser in good faith, for a valuable consideration, of the land&nbsp; in&nbsp; question,&nbsp; and considering that he was a purchaser prior to&nbsp; the purchase of the plaintiff and considering&nbsp; that he entered into the possession of the land under and by virtue of said&nbsp; purchase, we are of the opinion and so hold that the judgment of the lower&nbsp; court should be and&nbsp; is hereby affirmed, with costs. So&nbsp; ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J.,&nbsp; Torres, Carson,</i> and <i>Araullo JJ.,</i> concur.<br></div>
