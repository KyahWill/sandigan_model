				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On the 26th of August, 1898, in the capital of the Province of Capiz, Dona Luisa Asis y Diangco and Don Jorge Pardo y  Acevedo,  by  a public  document entered into a contract,  the principal features of which were: (1)  That Dona Luisa Asis received from Don Jorge Pardo, as a loan, without  interest, the sum of 2,300  pesos.  (2)  That as security for this loan Dona Luisa executed a mortgage, in favor of Don Jorge Pardo, on seven parcels  of real estate. (3)  That Dona Luisa  Asis bound herself to pay the sum loaned within  five years from the date  of the contract, and to apply each year toward the extinction of the indebtedness the total amount of the rents and profits received from the mortgaged property.   (4) That Jorge Pardo was to have the management of the mortgaged  property, and that its enjoyment should not revert to  Dona Luisa Asis until the  entire sum loaned should be repaid.   (5) That the mortgage of  the property referred to was to include all manufactories,  buildings, receptacles, apparatus, and everything else  thereon necessary for the distillation of nipa alcohol.</p>
<p>On the 22d of  February, 1902, Luisa Asis filed a complaint against Jorge Pardo in which she asked that he be ordered to  give  an account of his management of the property referred to, and that all profits which might have accrued therefrom be applied toward the extinction of the indebtedness.  Luisa Asis based her complaint on the contract of loan above referred to.</p>
<p>The court below made  the above-mentioned  contract a part of its decision, and further found that  after its date the appellant, the plaintiff below, borrowed from the appellee $470, which  was to be added  to the original loan; that the  distillery on the place was operated by the appellee, but that some time after the making of the original contract  the appellant assumed the management of the nipa lands; that  her tenants carried the tuba to the distillery, and she received credit from the appellee for the amount due to her for each delivery.</p>
<p>The only question in this  case is  thus stated by the appellant: <em>Has the defendant  the usufruct of the distillery, or ought the revenue derived from the distillery to he also applied  toward the  extinction of the debt?</em></p>
<p>If we had to decide the case upon the contract of August 26 alone, it might  be difficult  to sustain the judgment; but the court has found that this contract was afterwards changed by the parties.  The  management of the nipa lands was taken from the defendant and given to the appellant.</p>
<p>The court also  found that the parties  had  two settlementsâ€”one on June 12, 1900, and  the other on January 1, 1902.  The written receipts delivered on the  settlements stated that "on this  day we have made a settlement of the products of the nipa lands and  distillery."</p>
<p>The court also finds :</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"In the  said settlements nothing was said  concerning the use of the distillery or its apparatus, nor was the plaintiff given any credit therefor.   The plaintiff fully understood the method employed in rendering accounts, as well as  the contents of  the  documents  executed, and at  the time of the execution of these documents no opposition was made, nor  were the profits claimed, or the rendering of accounts demanded,  with respect to the use of the distillery and apparatus."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This practical construction put upon the contract by the parties themselves is almost conclusive that the appellant, at the time the settlements were made, had no right to the profits of the distillery.  If  she had had such right,  she certainly would have claimed  it.   The contract between the parties consisted not only of the document of August 26 but also of its subsequent  modifications.</p>
<p>The article of chapter 4,  title 2, book 4, of the Civil Code  applicable to the  case  is not article 1283, cited by the appellant as infringed by the  judgment  below, but article 1282.   While the present Code of Civil Procedure contains  several rules for the construction of contracts (sees. 286-294), they are not inconsistent with the provisions  of  this article, 1282,  &gt;vhich  therefore  remains in force.</p>
<p>The appellant is concluded by the settlements  already made, and as to the years prior to 1902 we hold that she is not entitled to any credit for the rent of the distillery for such years.   As to 1902, the time for a settlement had not arrived  when this action  was commenced, and we decide  nothing  as to the appellant's rights for that and subsequent years.</p>
<p>The judgment is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Cooper,</em> and <em>McDonough, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em> Mapa, J.,</em> did not sit in this case.<br>
