				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On September 2, 1905,&nbsp; Gregorio Mallari, accompanied by his wife, Julia Sunga, presented himself to Emigdio&nbsp; Bundoc Taliri and&nbsp; requested the latter&nbsp; to&nbsp; trust&nbsp; him with some embroidered <i> jusi </i> cloth&nbsp; to sell&nbsp; on commission.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mallari agreed to deliver to the owner of the cloth the proceeds of the sales, or the&nbsp; cloth itself in case it should not have been sold,&nbsp; by the 30th of&nbsp; December of that year.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pursuant to the request, the accused spouses received from&nbsp; Taliri 66 pieces of embroidered <span style="font-style: italic;">jusi, </span>valued at P198, and thereupon Fulgencio Jaime drew up a contract in Spanish from data furnished him in the Pampanga dialect.&nbsp;&nbsp; After this document had been written it was&nbsp; read to the said spouses and interpreted to them in Pampanga,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; next&nbsp;&nbsp; day&nbsp; it was ratified before the notary, Simplicio Mangila, although Julia&nbsp; Sunga did&nbsp; not appear before the notary, saying that she did not think her presence was necessary as, according to the offended party, she had already signed the document. As Mallari did not fulfill his agreement to deliver the value of the cloth or the cloth itself,&nbsp; should it not have been sold, the owner of the goods made a demand upon him, at the time the agreement was broken, and on several&nbsp; occasions afterwards, once in writing and the other times verbally through Nicolas Quiambao, for the return of the cloth or the delivery of its price; but&nbsp; Mallari always replied that the cloth was not yet sold, when Taliri knew that it was; wherefore the latter, believing that he was the victim of a fraud, made a complaint to the court of the justice of&nbsp; the peace of San Fernando, Pampanga,&nbsp; and the record of the proceedings in the case was afterwards&nbsp; forwarded to&nbsp; the Court of First Instance.<br><br>On the basis of the foregoing facts, the provincial fiscal, on November 5,&nbsp; 1908, filed&nbsp; a complaint with the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of the&nbsp; said&nbsp; province charging&nbsp; the spouses Gregorio Mallari and Julia Sunga with the crime of<i> estafa,</i> and the cause having been tried, the judge, in&nbsp; view of the evidence adduced, rendered&nbsp; judgment therein&nbsp; on&nbsp; October 12, 1908, and sentenced each of the accused to the penalty of six months' <i>arresto mayor</i>, to the accessory penalties, to indemnify Emigdio Bundoc&nbsp; Taliri severally and jointly in the sum of P198, with subsidiary imprisonment in&nbsp; case of insolvency, and each to pay one-half of the costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Gregorio Mallari died on the&nbsp; 4th of the said month of October, in the pueblo of Macabebe, wherefore, by order of December 24, 1908, the case was dismissed in so far as it concerned him, and an appeal was taken by the surviving defendant, Julia&nbsp; Sunga.<br><br>Starting from the hypothesis that due proof was actually adduced&nbsp; in this cause&nbsp; of the existence&nbsp; and reality of the crime&nbsp; of <i>estafa </i>herein charged, and of&nbsp; the&nbsp; guilt of&nbsp; the accused Gregorio Mallari, although, on&nbsp; account of the latter's death on October&nbsp; 4,&nbsp; 1908, a few days before the judgment&nbsp; appealed from was&nbsp; rendered,&nbsp; the case was dismissed with respect to the deceased, by order&nbsp; of December 23 of the same year (p. 101 of the record), withal the proceedings had in the case&nbsp; do not show full proof of the&nbsp; guilt of the other&nbsp; defendant, Julia Sunga, the&nbsp; wife&nbsp; of the&nbsp; deceased defendant, Gregorio Mallari, as a coprincipal of the crime under prosecution.<br><br>The circumstance of Julia Sunga's having been present when her husband Gregorio Mallari received from the aggrieved party the 66 pieces&nbsp; of embroidered <i>jusi</i> cloth, and when the instrument of contract was executed, expressive of the delivery and receipt of the cloth and of the obligation to deliver the price thereof, or to return the cloth, in case it should not have been sold by December 30, 1905,&nbsp; to its owner,&nbsp; Emigdio Taliri, does not determine, on account&nbsp; of the husband's nonfulfilment of his agreement, criminal liability on the part of the wife.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because she&nbsp; accompanied her husband on that occasion, it does not follow that she was criminally liable for&nbsp; the deceitful and fraudulent conduct of&nbsp; her&nbsp; husband, so&nbsp; long as it&nbsp; is not shown that the wife participated directly or even indirectly in the appropriation or abstraction of the cloth received&nbsp; for its sale on commission by the husband.<br><br>Between the document Exhibit A, on the one hand, which contains a&nbsp; copy of the memorandum written by the notary Simplicio Mangila on page 37, back, of the registry book of instruments executed&nbsp; or&nbsp; ratified&nbsp; in&nbsp; his office - a copy subscribed&nbsp; by the notary Cosme Garcia, because the said Mangila who wrote the&nbsp; copied memorandum afterwards died - and on the other hand, the Exhibit B, which is said to be a transcript or reproduction of&nbsp; the instrument alleged to have&nbsp; been&nbsp; executed by the said spouses and in which record was made of the receipt of the cloth and the agreement to return it&nbsp; or its&nbsp; value on December 30, 1905, since the authenticity&nbsp; of this document Exhibit B does not appear to have&nbsp; been&nbsp; proved at the trial, the&nbsp; contents, of the memorandum copied in Exhibit A must necessarily be relied upon, inasmuch as&nbsp; it is&nbsp; a proven fact&nbsp; that the defendant&nbsp; Julia Sunga did not appear before the notary&nbsp; to ratify the contents of&nbsp; the document alleged to have been written by the witness&nbsp;&nbsp; Fulgencio Jaime&nbsp; which,&nbsp; having disappeared,&nbsp; was substituted by the Exhibit B, an imitation or reproduction of the same.&nbsp;&nbsp; The memorandum copied in Exhibit A reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"Don&nbsp;&nbsp; Gregorio Mallari, executor of the instrument, D. Emigdio B. Taliri,&nbsp; creditor, D. Fulgencio Jaime,&nbsp; witness, Venancio Reyes.&nbsp; By commission&nbsp; on sale value of P198, Sept. 3,&nbsp; 1905.&nbsp; The commission is on&nbsp; sixty-six pieces of embroidered <i>jusi,</i> the proceeds from the sale of which shall be delivered to Taliri&nbsp; on the 30th day of&nbsp; December of the present year."</blockquote>In this note, which&nbsp; must be a true extract of the instrument drawn up by the witness Jaime and which was ratified before a notary&nbsp; by the executor thereof, Mallari, neither the name of the&nbsp; appellant Julia Sunga,&nbsp; nor&nbsp; any mention thereof, appears.&nbsp; It was therefore not necessary for her to ratify the contents of the documents executed by her husband, as is made to appear in Exhibit B,&nbsp; for accepting as certain and exact the memorandum copied in Exhibit A, as averred by the notary who transcribed it from the registry book kept by the deceased&nbsp; notary Simplicio Mangila&nbsp; who wrote the memorandum and before whom the ratification was made, the participation&nbsp; of Julia Sunga in the aforesaid agreement of her husband, such as it appears in the document reproduced by Exhibit B,&nbsp; can not properly be admitted as a fact. It would not be hazardous to affirm that were&nbsp; the notary Mangila&nbsp; now living he perhaps would&nbsp; not&nbsp; have exhibited the&nbsp; said document, Exhibit B,&nbsp; after&nbsp; the disappearance of&nbsp; its original authentically abstracted in the instrument Exhibit A.<br><br>The fraud or the deceit must not&nbsp; be looked for in the act of making the contract of commission and of executing the instrument&nbsp; annotated&nbsp; by the notary according to Exhibit A.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; malice and&nbsp; the elements constituting&nbsp; the crime of <i>estafa</i> supervened after the receipt&nbsp; of the cloth, and under this assumption the record of the cause does not disclose conclusive proof that Julia Sunga participated in the&nbsp; punishable acts committed by&nbsp; her husband who,&nbsp; according to the testimony of the aggrieved party himself,&nbsp; was&nbsp; the sole person who took charge of the cloth for the purpose of selling it on commission and came&nbsp; to terms of agreement with&nbsp; the&nbsp; owner&nbsp; thereof,&nbsp; wherefore the demands&nbsp; made through a third party in behalf of the offended person were addressed to the said Mallari.&nbsp; The criminal liability of the appellant can not be established by the circumstance&nbsp; that her name appears beside that of her husband in the charges preferred against the latter in connection&nbsp; with the alleged <i>estafa.</i><br><br>For the foregoing reasons,&nbsp; and in view&nbsp; of the fact that the trial of&nbsp; this cause disclosed no conclusive proof&nbsp; of the guilt of&nbsp; the defendant&nbsp; Julia&nbsp; Sunga, it&nbsp; is&nbsp; proper,&nbsp; in our opinion,&nbsp; with a reversal of the judgment&nbsp; appealed from, to&nbsp; absolve Julia&nbsp; Sunga,&nbsp; with the&nbsp; costs&nbsp; of both&nbsp; instances <i>de&nbsp; oficio</i>, and it is so ordered.<br><br><i> Arellano, C. J., Johnson, Moreland,</i>&nbsp; and <i>Trent, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
