				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This  is an action for the recovery of a certain  tract of land.  The  court below entered judgment in favor of the plaintiff, to which judgment the defendant, Mariano Aguilan, only, excepted.  A motion for  a new trial was made on  the  ground that the finding of facts contained in the judgment of the  court  below was plainly and manifestly against the weight of the evidence. The court below made the following findings:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"(1) That some time ago there were mortgaged to Agustin Villanueva a certain tract of land belonging to Pedro Maguyon  (the plaintiff)  and another  tract belonging to the mother-in-law of Marcelino Agra.  Agustin Villanueva in turn mortgaged the land  to one Ocampo.  This mortgage was later transferred to  one of Ocampo's heirs, named Alad.</p>
  <p>"(2) That some time afterwards Marcelino Agra went to Agustin Villanueva and  told him  that  he  wished to redeem his mother-in-law's land.  Agustin Villanueva and Marcelino  Agra then went to Alad and  there redeemed the mortgage.   As the mortgage of the land of Pedro Maguyon and that of the mother-in-law of Marcelino Agra, executed by Agustin Villanueva to Ocampo, was  in one single instrument,  when  the mortgage in favor  of  Alad  was redeemed, Agustin Villanueva  told Marcelino  Agra  to separate the land of Pedro Maguyon  from that of his mother. Marcelino Agra to include  it in  the contract of sale executed by them.</p>
<p>"(3) That Marcelino Agra subsequently sold this land of his mother-in-law's to Mariano Aguilan (the appellant.) IJoth went to Agustin Villanueva to get the latter to draw up the document.   Agustin Villanueva drew up  tlie  instrument and advised the contracting  parties to exclude from the contract the land of Pedro Maguyon.   Aguilan and  Marcelino  Agra  answered  that  the land was not included.</p>
  <p>"(4) That when  Pedro Maguyon attempted to  redeem the mortgage of Agustin Villanueva it was discovered that the said land was included in the sale to Mariano Aguilan, whereupon  Marcelino  Agra and  Pedro Maguyon went to the justice court to settle their differences and then agreed to exclude  from the sale  made by Agra to Aguilan the land of Pedro  Maguyon,  and as  a consequence  of this agreement Mariano Aguilan fenced the land, excluding the portion thereof  belonging to Pedro Maguyon."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon the foregoing  facts the court below held that the land in question belonged to the plaintiff, Pedro  Maguyon, and Marcelino Agra to include it in the contract of sale executed by them.</p>
<p>The foregoing  facts were fully established at the trial by the testimony of three witnesses who  testified of their own knowledge that the same were true.   It  should  be? noticed that these witnesses had more or less to do with the land in question.   One of them, Agustin Yillanueva, is the person to whom the plaintiff had mortgaged the land,  the other witness was the defendant,  Marcelino Agra, through whom the appellant claimed, and the third witness was the justice of the peace before whom the  agreement between The plaintiff, the appellant, and Agra was made, excluding from the land purchased by the appellant from'the latter the land involved in this action,  doubtless because it was then admitted to be the property of the plaintiff.   To rebut this testimony the appellant presented  three  witnesses, two of  whom testified as to certain details  which, even though they were true, would not necessarily prove that the defendant was the real owner of the land.  For instance, the fact that when the appellant took possession  of  the land purchased from  Marcelino  Agra, the. plaintiff  was at a short distance from the lfitter, and this is one of  the most important facts to which those two witnesses testified, proves nothing against plaintiff's contention; first, because the witness who so testified did  not  know whether  the plaintiff saw  what the appellant was  doing,  and second, because the plaintiff had not as yet recovered  the physical possession of the land which he had turned over to Agustin Villanueva when  he mortgaged  the same to the latter and therefore had no  right to interfere directly with such possession.  The Hiird  witness  testified,  in  short,  that  the land in question had never belonged to the plaintiff.</p>
<p>The court below in weighing the evidence found that  the witnesses of the plaintiff were more credible than those of the appellant.  This finding  of the court not only is not erroneous but, on the contrary, is supported by the evidence in the case.  This  conclusion of the court below is justified by the preponderance of evidence.</p>
<p>The appellant further  introduced in evidence the judgment rendered in his favor in the action formerly brought by him against the plaintiff in this case to recover the possession of the land in question.  It may  be  said, however, that a final judgment rendered in an action to recover possession  does not  in  any  way  affect the question of title and such judgment is not and can  not be admitted as conclusive proof ill, an action for title such as the present one.  Section SI of the Code of Civil Procedure contains an express provision  to  this effect.   The facts  found by the court below in  regard to the possession  of the  land only can not be  successfully invoked to overcome the evidence introduced  in  this case  by  the plaintiff, not  as to the right of possession but as to the ownership of the land. The appellant himself contends that the conclusion of the court below to the effect that it was never  the intention of  Mariano Aguilan  and Marcelino Agra to include the said land in the contract of sale made by them, is contrary to  the stipulation of  facts entered into by the  parties to this action.  One of the facts agreed to by the  parties is, <em>that the land in question is included in the contract of sale made between Agra and Aguilan.</em> There seems to  be  no dispute upon this  point.  The stipulation refers  to the material fact resulting from  the sale,  whereas  the court below referred to  the real intention  of the  parties when they made the contract.   By reason of some mistake as to the boundaries of the land the property in question was as a matter of fact included in the land sold by Agra to Aguilan, but it clearly appears from the testimony of Agra and Agustin Villanueva that it was not the intention of the contracting parties to include the same in the said sale.</p>
<p>We accordingly affirm the judgment appealed from, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.   After the expiration of twenty days let judgment be entered in accordance herewith and let the record be remanded in due time  to the Court  of  First  Instance for execution.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano,  C. J.,  Torres, Johnson, Carson,  Willard,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
