				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The evidence of record in this case is  substantially as follows:</p>
<p>A  detachment  of Constabulary operating in  the Province  of Ambos Camarines discovered a group of  bandits rendezvoused on  the hemp farm or <em>late</em> of one Gamboa, who, as it appears, was one of the chiefs of the band.  The soldiers promptly opened fire on the brigands, all of whom, however, made their escape.  On reaching the  rendezvous the Constabulary found a  sack containing 70 chupas  of rice and the hat of the defendant lying on top of the sack, with his personal cedula stuck in  the lining.  They also discovered  a small box containing some  papers,  among which was a memorandum with the names of various persons thereon,  and  following  each name figures  which seemed to represent varying quantities of  hemp.   Among other names was that of the accused, and the words "50 piculs 3, 15."  Upon the return of the detachment to its headquarters fruitless search was  made for the accused at his home, which  was located not far distant from the Constabulary quarters.  On the third  day after  the  incident just related the accused presented  himself  to the Constabulary, stating that his wife had informed him that they  were searching for him, whereupon he was arrested, and charges of brigandage preferred against  him. The accused  admitted that he had been with  the bandits at the time  when they were discovered, but  alleged that he had been  captured  a few hours before  while working  in his master's hemp fields; that he made his escape in the confusion resulting from  the Constabulary attack, but that he did not dare to await their arrival for fear that he might be shot  before he could make himself known; that his return to his home had been  delayed by the floods and high waters then prevalent; that  he knew nothing whatever as to how the brigands came into possession of the rice  which had been found in their camp, and that he had been  found in that neighborhood because he was  a  laborer employed in the hemp fields of Gamboa.</p>
<p>Upon  this evidence  the accused  was convicted  of the crime of  knowingly aiding and abetting a band of brigands by  furnishing them  with the said rice, which  offense is defined and penalized in section 4 of  Act No.  518  of the Philippine Commission.</p>
<p>There  is no evidence whatever contradicting  the  statement  of  the accused that he had been captured by the bandits a few hours before their encounter with the Constabulary, nor is there anything inherently  improbable in the story.  There is no evidence whatever connecting the accused with the sack of rice found at the brigand rendezvous beyond  the mere fact, which  he admits, that he was in  their camp when the Constabulary  discovered them. There is no evidence that the accused knew  that  Gamboa was a brigand chief, nor does the fact  that the  accused was a laborer  upon the hemp farm of the  said  Gamboa tend in any  way to show that he was  a  brigand, or in sympathy with  the brigands, and  the memorandum  containing  the name of the accused and others is naturally and sufficiently explained, in view of the relations  between the accused and his employer.</p>
<p>We do not think that the evidence of record is sufficient to  sustain  a  conviction, and the judgment  and sentence appealed from is reversed, with the costs of both instances <em>de  oficio</em>, and the accused  is acquitted of the crime with which he is charged and will be set at liberty  forthwith. So  ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J.,  Torres, Mapa, Johnson,</em> and <em>Willard, JJ., </em>concur.</p>
