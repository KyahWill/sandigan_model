				G.R. No. 1007, May 10, 1903</h4>
				<H3>PAULINO REYES, PETITIONER, M.  HON. FEUX M. ROXAS, JUDGE OF FIRST INSTANCE OF RIZAL, RESPONDENT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MAPA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>In the case of the United States vs. The Municipality of Santa Cruz de Malabon, decided February  16, 1903,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> we have enunciated the doctrine that in accordance with section 107 of General Orders, No. 58,  no  private individual, other than the person injured may maintain a  criminal action for the prosecution of a crime.  The petitioners are not the persons injured in the present case.   The mere circumstance that  they are inhabitants of the municipality of Pasig does not confer upon  them this character in the sense in which the words <em>person injured</em> are used in that section,  with  respect  to  the embezzlement of the public funds of which the accused, as president of the town, may have been guilty.   It  can not be said, properly  speaking, that  such  funds  were the  property of the complainants. The person offended  in  such a case would be the municipality, and not the petitioners.</p>
<p>The petitioners,  therefore, have no  right to  bring any penal action  for the  purpose of  prosecuting and  punishing the said  crime.  Not having this right, they have in consequence no  right  to appeal against the order of dismissal entered by the judge in the preliminary investigation.   Such a right would be merely consequential to the right to maintain the penal action which, as above stated, they are not entitled to bring in this  case.</p>
<p>For this reason, and not upon the  grounds stated by fhe judge below, in his order, the <em>recurso de queja</em> brought by the petitioners is denied.  So ordered.</p>
<em>Arellano, C. J., Willard</em> and <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
