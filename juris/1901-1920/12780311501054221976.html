				<BR><BR><div align="justify">It appears from the record that on the 6th day of June, 1916, an election was 
held in the Province of La Union for the office of governor of said province; 
that at said election the protestant and protestees were each candidates; that 
at the close of said election the provincial board of canvassers, after a 
canvass of the votes of the respective municipalities of said province, declared 
that each of said candidates had received the following number of votes: 
<blockquote>
<table width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="50%">&nbsp;</td>
<td width="50%">
<div align="right">Vote.</div></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Pio Ancheta</td>
<td>
<div align="right">3,331</div></td></tr>

<div align="right">3,499</div></td></tr>

<td>
<div align="right">1,989</div></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Vicente Valpiedad</td>
<td>
<div align="right">55</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>
<p>Immediately on the announcement of the result of said election by said 
provincial board of canvassers the said Pio Ancheta filed the present protest in 
the Court of First Instance of the Province of La Union. The protestant alleged 
that certain irregularities and frauds had been practiced in the following 
municipalities: Bacnotan, San Juan, San Fernando, Bauang, Agoo, Balaoan, Balacan 
and Tubao.</p>
<p>The protestant alleged that if the illegal votes which had been cast in said 
municipalities were rejected from the total number of votes cast, that he (Pio 
Ancheta) would have received a majority of the votes cast.</p>
<p>Each of the candidates were duly notified of the presentation of said 
protest.</p>
<p>On the 26th day of July, 1916, the protestee, Mauro Ortiz, presented his 
answer, in which he interposed a general and special defense. In his general 
defense he denied generally and specifically all of the facts alleged in said 
protests. In his special defense he alleged that certain frauds and 
irregularities had been practiced by the municipal board of canvassers in the 
following municipalities: Luna, Bangar, Santo Tomas and Caba.</p>
<p>On the 26th day of July, 1916, the court appointed, by consent of the 
parties, the following commissioners for the purpose of hearing the proof to be 
adduced by the respective parties relating to the frauds and irregularities 
alleged in their respective protest and answer: Rafael Lete, Cosme Abenoja and 
H. W. Widdees. Said commissioners entered upon the performance of their duties 
on the 31st day of July, 1916, and continued their work up until about the 18th 
day of August, when they made their report. Their report is a very carefully 
prepared statement relating to the questions presented by the protest and 
answer. After hearing the respective parties and considering their proof, and an 
examination of the ballots cast in each of the said municipalities to which the 
protest related, the commissioners reached the following conclusion:</p>

<p>Said commissioners in their report stated that they had rejected 222 ballots 
for various reasons given.</p>
<p>Upon the presentation of said report the respective parties agreed that the 
same was correct and exact with reference to the number of ballots, "clear" and 
"questioned," found in the ballot boxes of the various municipalities. Both 
parties, however, the protestant as well as the protestee, Mauro Ortiz, asked 
permission to adduce additional proof with reference to the frauds and 
irregularities alleged to have been committed in the municipality of Bacnotan. 
Said permission was granted. Proof was adduced with reference to said alleged 
frauds, and the cause was submitted to the court for decision.</p>
<p>On the 9th day of May, 1917, the Honorable Manuel Camus, in a very carefully 
prepared opinion, reached the conclusion that Mauro Ortiz received 3,272.54 1/31 
legal votes, and that Pio Ancheta had received 3,285.59 1/31 legal votes and 
issued an order directed to the provincial board of canvassers to correct its 
return in accordance with said conclusion. It will be noted from the decision of 
the lower court that each candidate was given the number of votes which he had 
been accorded in the report of the commissioners except in the municipality of 
Bacnotan. In said municipality the commissioners gave to Mauro Ortiz 46 votes 
and to Pio Ancheta 467 votes, while the Court of First Instance, after a careful 
examination of the ballots, gave to Mauro Ortiz 80.54 16/31 votes and to Pio 
Ancheta 465.59 1/31 votes. In other words, upon a reexamination of the ballots 
found in the ballot box in said municipality, the lower court reached the above 
result after dividing between the various candidates eleven disputed ballots. It 
was by that means that the lower court reached the conclusion that the 
candidates received a fraction of a vote. Said eleven votes will be discussed 
later.</p>
<p>From that decision of the lower court the protestee, Mauro Ortiz, appealed 
and made several assignments of error, many of which may be discussed 
together.</p>
<p>The appellant contends that an error was committed by the lower court in not 
being- present and presiding over the sessions of the commissioners during the 
time they were examining the ballots and hearing proofs relating to the alleged 
frauds and irregularities. The appellant, either personally or by his attorney, 
was present during the sessions of the commissioners. He presented no objection 
to the fact that the sessions of said commission were not held in the presence 
of the court. He gave his consent to the method of conducting the investigation 
by the commissioners. He entered no protest. Shall he be heard now to enter a 
protest for the purpose of annulling the acts of the commissioners ? The 
doctrine is so well established that it no longer needs the citation of 
authorities to support it, that, generally, an objection which is not presented 
in the lower court will not be heard for the first time on an appeal. The 
appellant not only failed to present any objection in the court below, but 
actually gave his consent to the method of conducting the examination by the 
commissioners (pp. 2 to 5, stenographic notes.) And moreover, while it is not 
denied that the commissioners are subject to the control and direction of the 
court, their work would be of but little assistance to the court if they were 
required to act in its presence and under its direct supervision. The principal 
purpose in the appointment of commissioners is to save busy courts from the 
necessity of the detailed work of counting ballots. That purpose would be 
completely defeated if, notwithstanding the appointment of commissioners, the 
court should be required personally to assist in the counting of the votes.</p>
<p>Considering the fact that the parties consented to the method of examining 
the ballots by the commissioners in the court below without protest, and 
considering especially the fact that they agreed expressly to the method adopted 
by said commissioners, we are not now inclined to reverse or to modify the 
conclusions of the lower court upon the first assignment of error. (Hontiveros 
<em>vs</em>. Altavas, 24 Phil. Rep., 632.)</p>
<p>The second contention of the appellant is that the lower court committed an 
error in accepting the report of the commissioners with reference to various 
municipalities without hearing proofs relating to the frauds and irregularities 
charged. In answer to that contention it is sufficient to say that the 
appellant, as well as the appellee, admitted, when the report of the 
commissioners was presented, that it was true and an exact reference to all of 
the said municipalities in question, except that of Bacnotan. The proof adduced 
in the court below by the respective parties was limited to the alleged frauds 
and irregularities committed in the municipality of Bacnotan. Having thus 
agreed, and having thus accepted the report of the commissioners, and having 
failed to present any proof which in any way tended to affect the result reached 
by said commissioners in all of said municipalities, except Bacnotan, we see no 
reason now, the objection having been presented for the first time, for 
modifying the conclusions of the lower court.</p>
<p>The next contention of the appellant is that the municipal board of 
inspectors of the municipality of Bacnotan committed an error (<em>a</em>) in 
permitting certain ignorant and incapacitated persons to be assisted by the 
members of said board without first taking the oath required by law, and 
(<em>b</em>) in permitting certain persons to vote who had not theretofore been 
duly registered and qualified as voters.Whether or not said errors were 
committed is a question of fact. Proof relating to said alleged errors was 
adduced pro and con during the hearing before the lower court. While the proof 
is in conflict, and while several of the witnesses contradicted themselves 
frequently upon each of said questions, we are of the opinion that a fair 
preponderance of the proof adduced shows that neither of said irregularities 
were committed by the municipal board of inspectors.</p>
<p>In addition to what we have here stated we desire to make that part of the 
decision of the lower court relating to these particular alleged errors a part 
of this decision, without the necessity of repeating it here.</p>
<p>The protestee alleged and attempted to prove that ten or eleven persons voted 
at the election in the municipality of Bacnotan who had not been theretofore 
registered and qualified as voters. While the lower court reached the conclusion 
that that allegation had not been proved, yet, nevertheless, out of the 
abundance of caution, and without being able to determine for which particular 
candidate said eleven, votes had been cast, it divided the said eleven votes 
among the respective candidates in proportion to their total votes in said 
municipality. By that method the lower court reached the conclusion that each of 
the candidates in the municipality of Bacnotan received a fractional part of a 
vote. The lower court refused to annul the result of the election even though 
some persons had voted who were not qualified as voters. This conclusion, of 
course, was reached after it had found that a preponderance of the evidence 
shows that no such fact existed. But even though the eleven votes in question 
had all been given to the protestee, still that would not be sufficient to 
change the result.</p>
<p>After a careful examination of the record, and for the reasons above given, 
as well as for the reasons given in the decision of the lower court, we are of 
the opinion and so hold that the judgment of the lower court should be and is 
hereby affirmed, with costs against the protestee and appellant Mauro Ortiz. So 
ordered.</p>
