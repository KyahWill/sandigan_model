				<BR><STRONG>TRENT, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The information filed&nbsp; in this&nbsp; case is as follows:<br><blockquote>"That on or about the 31st of October, 1908, within the territory of the&nbsp; municipality&nbsp; of Cebu, in this province and judicial district, the said Miguel Villano, voluntarily, illegally, and criminally imported and knowingly introduced fraudulently into&nbsp; the said municipality&nbsp; merchandise&nbsp; consisting of 190 tins of opium valued at 10 <i>taels</i>, <span style="font-style: italic;">ex</span> steamship&nbsp; <i>Kaifong</i>, which vessel&nbsp; runs between Hongkong&nbsp; and Cebu; that&nbsp; the said Miguel Villano, knowing that the 190 tins of opium had&nbsp; been illegally&nbsp; imported received, secreted, purchased and sold the&nbsp; same; all contrary to&nbsp; law."<br></blockquote>Upon this information the defendant Miguel Villano&nbsp; was tried, convicted&nbsp; and sentenced to one year and two months of imprisonment,&nbsp; to pay a fine&nbsp; of two thousand&nbsp; five hundred&nbsp; (P2,500) pesos, and to&nbsp; pay the costs of the&nbsp; cause.<br><br>The 190 tins of opium, alleged&nbsp; in the complaint to have been imported into the Philippine&nbsp; Islands by the defendant, were not all imported at the same time, but came&nbsp; in on the steamer&nbsp; <i>Kaifong</i>&nbsp; on&nbsp; the following voyages: Voyage&nbsp; No. 121, 20 tins; No.&nbsp; 122, 20 tins;&nbsp; No. 123, 50 tins; and&nbsp; No. 124, 100 tins.&nbsp; As the&nbsp; importation of&nbsp; these&nbsp; 190 tins of opium in this manner constituted four separate&nbsp; and&nbsp; distinct crimes, on&nbsp; motion&nbsp; of the defendant the court ordered the prosecution to confine itself to the last shipment.<br><br>About the time the steamer <i>Kaifong</i>&nbsp; was in the port of Cebu on voyage No. 123 the defendant, a resident of Cebu, entered into a contract&nbsp; with one&nbsp; Lao Loc Hing,&nbsp; the <i>sobre-cargo</i> of this steamer, in which contract or agreement Lao Loc Hing promised and agreed to purchase in Hongkong, and bring into the port of Cebu, 100 tins of opium and turn same over to the defendant,&nbsp; for which the defendant promised to pay&nbsp; him the sum of P3,000.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lao Loc Hing complied with his part of this contract and upon the arrival of the steamer in the bay of Cebu on its one hundred and twenty- fourth&nbsp; voyage,&nbsp; he,&nbsp; Lao Loc&nbsp; Hing, notified&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant that the opium was aboard.&nbsp; The defendant, after having paid Lao Loc Hing the&nbsp; sum of P2,500 proceeded alongside the steamer about 11 o'clock on&nbsp; the night of October 31, 1908, and received the 100 tins of opium, which&nbsp; he carried ashore and later disposed of by sale to&nbsp; residents of Cebu. This opium was not manifested and was imported without the knowledge or consent&nbsp; of either the customs authorities or the owners or managers of the steamer <i>Kaifong.</i>&nbsp; The opium was not only imported into the&nbsp; Philippine Islands in violation of&nbsp; the Customs Administrative Act, but also in violation of&nbsp; Act No. 1761, known as the Opium Law, which was then in full force and effect and which prohibits the importation of opium, in any&nbsp; form,&nbsp; into the&nbsp; Philippine Islands&nbsp; by persons not duly authorized to do so.<br><br>The foregoing facts have not only been established by the testimony of Lao Loc Hing, who gave a detailed&nbsp; statement of everything which occurred with reference to the importation of this&nbsp; opium, but also by the testimony of&nbsp; one Apao, a stoker on the steamer Kaifong,&nbsp; who testified that he assisted Lao Loc Hing, on the night the opium was delivered to the defendant, in letting same down over the ship's side into the defendant's <i>baroto.</i>&nbsp; Other witnesses testified that they purchased from the defendant large quantities&nbsp; of opium about that time.<br><br>The defendant attempted to establish an&nbsp; alibi and testified&nbsp; that he was not in&nbsp; the town of Cebu on&nbsp; the night of October 31,&nbsp; 1908; that he left Cebu&nbsp; on&nbsp; the morning of the 31st and did&nbsp; not return until the afternoon&nbsp; of&nbsp; the 1st of November.&nbsp; He&nbsp; admitted that he was&nbsp; at that time an employee of Smith, Bell &amp; Co. and that his duty was to look after the discharging of merchandise from the steamer <i>Kaifong,</i> but that at&nbsp; this particular time he had obtained permission from his employers to visit another town.&nbsp; This alibi&nbsp; was completely&nbsp; destroyed by documentary&nbsp; evidence. The prosecution showed by&nbsp; a number&nbsp; of receipts signed by the defendant himself, and bearing date&nbsp; of October&nbsp; 31, 1908, that he was on&nbsp; that particular date looking after&nbsp; the discharge of&nbsp; that cargo; that he was&nbsp; on the steamer at the time and receipted&nbsp; for the&nbsp; merchandise as it left&nbsp; the ship's side.<br><br>The sentence imposed by the learned trial&nbsp; court, under all the facts and circumstances, is not excessive, especially when we take into consideration the gravity of the offense committed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The judgment&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from&nbsp; is,&nbsp; therefore, affirmed: <i>Provided</i>, That in case of insolvency the defendant shall&nbsp; suffer&nbsp; the corresponding&nbsp; subsidiary&nbsp; imprisonment. Costs against the defendant.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J., Mapa, Carson</i>, and <i>Moreland, JJ.</i>, concur.<br></div>
