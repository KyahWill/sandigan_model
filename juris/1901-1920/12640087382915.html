				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>In  this  case the plaintiffs, who  are the children and grandchildren of Vicente Andres Cam and Florentina Juan, both now deceased, commenced this action in the Court of First Instance  of  the Province of  Ilocos Norte, for  the purpose  of  obtaining  possession  and determining the title to five parcels  of land and for the value of the products of said land.  Judgment having been rendered by the  court below, Honorable  Dionisio Chanco  presiding,  denying  the plaintiffs' right to recover for the value  of the  products, but  declaring  that they  are the  owners  and entitled  to the possession of said lands,  both parties appealed and presented separate bills  of exceptions; but  the  plaintiffs  now ask that the judgment appealed from be affirmed in all of its  parts, so it will not  be necessary to examine into the question of  the plaintiffs'  right to a judgment for the products of the  land.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs base their title to the lands in dispute upon a purchase and sale made by their father, Vicente Andres Cam,  on  the 18th day of August, 1886, from Loreano Pimentel, father of the defendant Valeriana Pimentel, while, on the other hand, the defendant claims to have inherited these lands from her mother, Dona Ines Guerrero.  Both parties presented oral and documentary  evidence  for the purpose  of establishing their respective claims.</p>
<p>One of the defenses interposed by the defendant is <em>res judicata</em>,  based upon a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Norte, wherein Angelo Andres et al. were plaintiffs and Domingo Caluya was defendant.  The question here presented is whether or not the judgment in that case is an adjudication of the subject-matter  in the  case at bar, so that it  can not be retried.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs  in the former  case were Angelo Andres, Cenona Andres,  Eduvigis  Andres,  Venancio Andres, Alejandro Andres, Maria Reyes, Sotera Fondevilla, and Maria Andres;  and the defendant was Domingo Caluya.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs  in  the present case are Angelo Andres, Cenona Andres,  Eduvigis  Andres,  Venancio Andres, Alejandro Andres, Maria Andres, Juan Andre's, Higino Andres, Margarita Andres, Maria Andres, and Pedro Andres; and the defendant is  Valeriana Pimentel.</p>
<p>The subject-matters of the  actions are exactly the same in both  casesâ€”the  lands  in question.  The same documentary  material evidence was presented by both  parties in both cases, but the record  does not disclose whether the oral testimony was the same or not.  The plaintiffs  in both cases as  appears from the evidence thus submitted claim ownership of the  lands in dispute by inheritance from their deceased parents, Vicente Andres Cam and Florentina Juan, and  that  their deceased father  acquired these lands  by purchase from  Loreano Pimentel, father of the defendant in the present case.  While on the other hand, the defendant in the former case alleged that said lands belonged to his mother-in-law, the defendant in this case, and  she, in the present case, claims  ownership of  these lands  by inheritance from her deceased mother, Ines Guerrero.   The judgment in the former case is the following:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="right"> "LAOAG, <em>August 2, 1905</em>.</p>
  <p>"The plaintiffs claim the land described  in the complaint, alleging that the same belonged to their deceased parents.</p>
  <p>"The defendant  opposes this claim on  the ground that the land in question  belongs to  his mother-in-law, Valeriana Pimentel.</p>
  <p>"The plaintiffs and  the defendant respectively presented documents to show their alleged title to the lands.  It appears from the documents presented by plaintiffs that the ownership claimed  by  them is derived from an assignment or cession made by Laureano Pimentel in favor of their parents in payment of a debt, and the documents presented by defendant show that the  lands were  inherited by Valeriana Pimentel from her mother,  Ines Guerrero.</p>
  <p>"It is necessary to first establish the title of the assignor, Laureano Pimentel, which is rebutted by the allegation and proof of ownership on the part of Valeriana Pimentel, in order that the assignment may not be considered prejudicial to the latter's  right, she not having been  a party  to  the said assignment or cession.   The  documents presented by the plaintiffs may be sufficient as between  them and Laureano Pimentel and his heirs, but  they are not binding upon a  third person who asserts a different right or title derived from that of the said Laureano.</p>
  <p>"The  title in  the  assignor Laureano Pimentel not having been  duly  established  in this case, the allegations of the complaint are not sufficient, and the court  hereby absolves the defendant therefrom, with the costs  against the  plaintiffs.</p>
  <p>"It is so ordered."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Counsel for the defendant, in discussing the question of <em>res judicata,</em> confine themselves to one point.  This point is stated by them in the following language:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Both the preponderance of authority in this country, and the  weight of sound legal reason sustain the doctrine that the former judgment, if admissible under the general issue, is just as conclusive when so presented as if it had been specifically set up by a plea at bar."</p></blockquote>
<p>Let it be admitted  that this is the law upon  this point. Yet the question of <i>res judicata</i> is  not, by any means, disposed of, as it will be  seen  that the parties of record  in both actions are not exactly  the same, neither are the defendants the same.  But it  does appear that exactly the same material question was submitted to the court in both cases;  that is,  the ownership of  the  land.  While it  is difficult  to determine with absolute certainty the precise point upon which the  first judgment was based,  let us say, for the purpose of determining the question  of <em>res judicata</em> with reference to  the defendant  Valeriana  Pimentel, that the real question presented and determined in the former case was whether or not Laureano Pimentel  was the owner of these lands at the time he ceded them to the father of the plaintiffs, and that this  question was decided in the negative.  Valeriana Pimentel  was  not a party of record in that suit.  Her son-in-law  was the only defendant.   The record fails to disclose whether  or not she was present during the trial or took any part  whatever in  the same. The statement "which is rebutted  by the allegations and proof of ownership on  the part of Valeriana  Pimentel" might indicate  that she was present and  furnished  the proof, but this fact is not by any means clear.</p>
<p>In the case of Tanguinlay vs. Quiros (10 Phil. Rep., 360), this court said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The law  of <em>res judicata </em>is  well settled  in the United States and is laid down in a series of decisions of the  Supreme Court  to the effect that as between the  parties to the first judgment and their privies it operates as a bar to a second action upon the same  claim, not only as to issues actually in litigation but also as to all matters which might have been litigated therein, whereas in an action between them upon a different  cause it is a bar only as to matters actually litigated.   (Cromwell <em>vs.</em> County of  Sac, 94 U. S., 351; Werlein <em>vs.</em> New Orleans, 177 U. S., 390; United States <em>vs.</em> California  Co., 192 U. S., 355; Fayerweather <em>vs.</em> Hitch, 195  U.  S., 276, 299; N, P. Railway Co. <em>vs.</em> Slaght,  205 U.S., 122.)"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The phrase  "between  the parties  to the first judgment and their privies" is not defined in that case, so we must look  to  other  authorities for the purpose  of  determining the meaning of the words "parties and their privies" when used in  this connection.</p>
<p>The general rule is thus stated in  24 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. Law (2ded.), 724:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The  persons between whom the judgment  or decree in a suit is conclusive in a  subsequent suit are the parties to the prior suit  and their privies,  and  as a general rule it is conclusive only between them.  The mere fact that a person had an interest in the subject-matter of the prior suit will not render the  judgment or decree therein conclusive upon him."   (Citing in support of this rule a long list of cases.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It  is also stated in the same volume,  page 827, that:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Judgments in actions  or suits in personam are inter partes and  binding and  conclusive only upon the parties of record, and, in some instances, persons  who actually participate in  the litigation and their privies.</p>
  <p>"It is a rule that estoppels must be  mutual; and therefore a party  will not be  concluded, against his contention, by a former judgment, unless he could have used it as a protection,  or as the foundation of  a claim had the judgment been the other way; and conversely no person  can claim the benefit of a judgment as an estoppel upon "his adversary unless he would have been prejudiced by a contrary decision of the case."  (23 Cyc,  1238, and a  large number  of cases cited thereunder.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Valeriana Pimentel, as we have said, the defendant in the present case, was not a defendant of record in the former  case.  This being true, would she have been bound by the judgment of the court had it  been against the contention  of her  son-in-law, Domingo Caluya, the  defendant in that  action?  In other words, if the court had declared in the former case that the lands in question  were the property of those plaintiffs, would Valeriana Pimentel have been bound by that judgment?  If so, then her defense of <em>res judicata</em> is well founded; but if not, then she cannot interpose  this  defense against the present plaintiffs.   As she was not a party of record in that case, and as the record in the  present case fails  to show that she was present and took part  in the former trial, we think that that judgment, had it  been in favor of the plaintiffs, would not be binding upon her.  Consequently, the judgment in  that case is not <i>res judicata</i> between  the parties in the present case.   The plaintiffs  appealed from  the judgment in the former case, but said  appeal was dismissed by  this court  for failure to prosecute.  We do not know why the plaintiffs failed to prosecute  their appeal unless  it be said that they knew that a judgment against the  defendant Domingo Caluya could not prejudice the  rights of Valeriana Pimentel,  and they therefore  decided to abandon that case  and institute new proceedings against the real  party, the defendant.   If the record had shown that Valeriana  Pimentel had full notice of the  pendency of the former suit and did in fact advise with the defendant as to the  plan  of the defense, the question might have been different.  Again, the former judgment could not be <em>res  judicata</em> against those plaintiffs in the present case who were not parties to the former.</p>
<p>The  other questions raised relate to the probative force of the oral and documentary evidence presented by the parties.</p>
<p>Counsel for the plaintiffs, on page 6 of his printed brief, says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"We make this  assertion with  such  certainty and confidence that we hereby declare that our clients are agreeable and will  not object to the honorable court declaring the defendant owner of the lands to which the  witnesses of the latter refer, and which  are described in Exhibits AA and BB."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the lands in dispute are those described in defendant's documents, then said  lands must be the property  of the defendant, as the plaintiffs  lay no claim to the lands described in those documents.  While on the other hand, if the lands described in the complaint and  in  the  documents  of the plaintiffs are separate and distinct from  those described in the defendant's documents then said lands must necessarily be  the  property  of the plaintiffs,  as the defendant only claims title to the lands described in her documents.  It is necessary to examine the proof in order to determine these questions.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs assert title to five parcels of  land, three within the municipality of Dingras and two within the municipality of  Laoag.  These lands,  according  to the  amended complaint, are described as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>" (<em>a</em>)  The first is located in the sitio of Santa Regina in the municipality of Dingras, Province of Ilocos Norte, P. I., having a perimeter of 1,426 meters; bounded on the north by a part of the land which is the subject of this litigation and described under letter (6), and Dona Mariana Pimentel ; on the east by Mariana Pimentel; on the south by a river and Dona Vicenta Luz;  and on the west by said Dona Vicenta Luz.</p>
  <p>"(<em>b</em>)  The second is situated in the sitio of Caniogan vel Ave Maria of the said municipality, having a perimeter of 762.30 meters; bounded on the north by  a <em>carrizal</em>; on the east by Juan  Alvano Pimentel; on the  south by the land above described; and on the west by Vicenta Luz and heirs of D. Jose M.a Albornos.</p>
  <p>"(<em>c</em>)  The third is situated in the sitio of Caniogan  of the said municipality of Dingras, having a perimeter of 1,269 meters; bounded on the north by a <em>carrizal</em>; on the east by Antonio Bustamante, formerly Mariana  Pimentel;  on the south by Jose  Bustamante and Valeriana Pimentel; and on the west by Mariana Pimentel.</p>
  <p>"(<em>d</em>)  The fourth is situated in the sitio of Doro, municipality of Laoag, Province of Ilocos Norte, P. L,  having a perimeter of 429.30 meters; bounded on  the  north by Nemesio Segundo, formerly the woman  called Guillerma; on the east by  Jose Bustamante, formerly  Francisco  Bustamante, on the south by the Palangoy Estero,  and on the west by Antonio Bustamante, formerly Francisco Bustamante.</p>
  <p>"(<em>e</em>) The fifth is located in the said sitio of Doro, having a perimeter of 165.20 meters; bounded  on the north  and west by Antonio Bustamante, formerly Francisco Bustamante; on the east by the heirs of Eduardo Fontanilla,  formerly Leocadio Guerrero; on the south by Pedro Hernando."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The lands in plaintiffs' Exhibit Q, which they claim that their father purchased from Laureano Pimentel, are located and described as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"(1) Situated  in the sitio of Santa  Regina,  bounded on the north and east by lands belonging to the heirs  of Don German Pimentel; on the south and west by lands  of Don Sabas Luz; with a perimeter of 719 brazas.</p>
  <p>" (2) Situated in the sitio of Caniogan,  a field and garden, bounded on the north by virgin, unkept lands;  (no eastern boundary  given)  ; on the south by  lands belonging to  the heirs of Don German Pimentel; on the west by lands of Don Norberto Garces; with a perimeter  of 612 brazas.</p>
  <p>"(3)  Situated  in the sitio of Caniogan  vel Ave  Maria, bounded on the north by virgin lands; on the east by lands of Juan Alzano Pimentel; on the  south by lands belonging to the heirs of Don German Pimentel;  and on the west by lands of Don Sabas Luz; with a perimeter of 554 brazas.</p>
  <p>"(4)  Situated in the sitio of  Doro, bounded on the north by lands of a woman called Guillerma, on the east and west by lands of Don  Francisco  Bustamante,  and on the south by an estero, with a perimeter of 340 varas.</p>
  <p>"(5)  Situated in the sitio of Doro, bounded on the north and west by lands of Francisco Bustamante, on  the east by lands of Leocadio Guerrero, and on  the south by lands of Pedro Hernando; with a perimeter of 171 varas."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The lands described in plaintiffs'  Exhibit R,  which is a possessory  title duly recorded, are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"(1)  Situated in the sitio of  Santa Regina, having a  perimeter of 719 brazas; bounded on the north and east by land belonging to the heirs of the deceased Don German Pimentel ; on the south and west by lands of Vicenta Luz.</p>
  <p>"(2)  Situated in the sitio of  Caniogan,  composed of a field and garden, having a perimeter of 612 brazas; bounded on  the north by uncultivated lands,  on the east and west by lands of Maria Pimentel; on the south by lands belonging to the heirs of the deceased German Pimentel.</p>
  <p>"(3)  Situated in the sitio of  Caniogan vel  Ave Maria, having a  perimeter of 354 brazas; bounded on the north by  uncultivated  lands; on the east by lands of Apolonia Alvano, on the south by lands belonging to the  heirs of the deceased Don  German Pimentel, on  the west by  lands of Dona Vicenta Luz."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The  lands in defendant's  Exhibit  AA are  described as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"(1)  Situated in the sitio of Sta. Maria, having a perimeter of 1,459.5 varas;  bounded on the north and east by lands of Don Jose Maria  Albornos, on the west by lands of Don Juan Alvano Pimentel,  and on the south  by lands of Don Francisco Bustamante and  the  said Don  Jose Maria Albornos.</p>
  <p>"(2)  Situated in the sitio of San Agustin, having a perimeter of 1,600 varas;  bounded on the north and east by Dona Simona Pimentel, on the south with land of Don Sabas Luz, on the west by lands of Dona Felipa Pimentel, and on the  east by lands of the said Don Jose Maria Albornos.</p>
  <p>"(3)  Situated in the sitio of Santa Regina, having a perimeter of 1,500 varas; bounded  on the north and west by lands of the said Dona Felipa Pimentel, on the east by lands of the said Don Francisco Bustamante, and on the south by lands of Don  Mariano Gonzales.</p>
  <p>"(4)  Situated in the  sitio of San  Jose, having a perimeter of 1,600 varas; bounded on the north and east by lands of the said Don Jose Maria Albornos,  on the west by lands of the said Don Francisco Bustamante,  and on the south with lands of the said Don Sabas Luz."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The  lands described in defendant's  Exhibit BB are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"(1)  Situated in the sitio of Doro, having an area of 27 ares and 87 centares;  bounded on the north by the garden of Bernabe Segundo, on the south by a footpath, on the east by land of the minor Don Jose Bustamante, and on the west by lands of Dona Manuela Bustamante and the said minor Don Jose Bustamante.</p>
  <p>"(2)  Situated in the sitio of Doro, having an area of 10 ares and 7  centares; bounded on  the north with the land of Dona Valeriana Pimentel y Guerrero, on the south by land of Don Pedro Hernando, on  the east by land of Don Cosme Asuncion, and on the west by land of Don  Francisco Bustamante."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be noted that there are only three parcels of land included in the possessory information filed by the  plaintiffs. These three parcels are situated in the municipality of Dingras.  The other two parcels claimed by the plaintiffs are in the municipality of Laoag.  These lands being in different municipalities may  be the reason why they were not all included in the same  petition for a possessory title.</p>
<p>The description of the lands in question  given by the plaintiffs in the case instituted in 1904 is exactly the same as that given  in the present case.  The location of  these lands as given  in these complaints is exactly the same as that given in Exhibit Q, the document of transfer from Loreano Pimentel to  the father  of the plaintiffs, but the descriptions are not exactly the  same, neither  are the perimeters.  The perimeters in the first are  given in meters, while in Exhibit Q they are given in brazas.   The perimeters in brazas reduced to meters show a difference which is not so very great. The names of  the landowners joining these parcels as given in the complaint are not exactly the same as those stated in Exhibit Q.   This discrepancy is necessarily due to changes in ownership of such lands since the year 1886.   Considering the oral testimony, together with the description of the lands given in  the complaint, in Exhibit Q, and in Exhibit R, it  is established by a  preponderance of  evidence  that the lands referred to in these  three documents are the same.</p>
<p>As far as the parcels  in Dingras are concerned, it is impossible to reconcile the descriptions given in defendant's Exhibit AA with any of the descriptions.   There are four parcels described in this Exhibit AA, one in Santa Maria, one in San Agustin,  one in Santa Regina, and one in  San Jose.  The plaintiffs claim no lands in either Santa Maria, San Agustin, or San Jose.  While  some of the boundaries of the land in  Doro given in Exhibit BB coincide with the description of the lands claimed by  the  plaintiffs in that same sitio, nevertheless the record clearly establishes the fact that the plaintiffs and their parents were in possession of all the lands in question for more than ten years, or from the time the same were transferred to them in 1886 until they were  finally ousted about the year 1899 by the son-in-law of the defendant.   This son-in-law  illegally took possession of  these lands in that year in  violation of the judgment of the Court of First Instance in  a case wherein Florentina Juan was plaintiff and  Caluya was defendant. In this judgment, which was rendered August 5, 1895, the court directed Caluya to abstain from molesting Florentina Juan in the possession of these lands.</p>
<p>We think, after a close examination of the entire record, that the judgment appealed from should be  affirmed, with costs against the appellant.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano,  C. J., Torres,  Mapa,  Johnson,  Carson,</em> and <em>Moreland,  JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
