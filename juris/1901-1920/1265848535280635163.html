				<H3>ASUNCION NABLE JOSE ET AL., PLAINTIFFS AND APPELLANTS, VS. MARIA IGNACIA USON ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>MORELAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The question involved in this appeal arises from the interpretation of the 
first and second clauses of a codicil to the will of Filomena Uson. They read as 
follows:
<blockquote>
<p>"First. I declare that all the property which belongs to me as conjugal 
property, referred to in my said testament, shall be the property of my 
aforesaid husband, Don Rafael Sison; in case all or part of said property exists 
at my husband's death, it is my will that at his death my sisters and nieces 
hereinafter named succeed him as heirs.</p>
<p>"Second. I declare to be my sisters in lawful wedlock the persons named Dona 
Antonia Uson, now deceased, who has left two daughters called Maria Rosario, 
widow, and Maria Paz, unmarried; Maria Romualda Uson, widow of Estanislao 
Lengson; Ignacia Uson, married to Don Vicente Puzon; Eufemia Uson, now deceased, 
who is survived by three daughters called Maria Salud, Maria Amparo, and Maria 
Asuncion; and Maria Pilar Uson; Maria Manaoag Uson, unmarried, issue had by our 
deceased father Don Daniel Uson with one Leonarda Fernandez, alias Andao de 
Lingayen, so that they may have and enjoy it in equal parts as good sisters and 
relatives."</p></blockquote>
<p>The court below found that the children of the deceased sisters should take 
only that portion which their respective mothers would have taken if they had 
been alive at the time the will was made; that the property should be divided 
into six equal parts corresponding to the number of sisters; that each living 
sister should take one-sixth, and the children of each deceased sister should 
also take one-sixth, each one-<br>sixth to be divided among said children 
equally.<br><br>This appeal is taken from the judgment entered upon that 
finding, appellants asserting that under a proper construction of the paragraphs 
of the codicil above-quoted the property should be divided equally between the 
living sisters and the children of the deceased sisters, share and share alike, 
a niece taking the same share that a sister receives.</p>
<p>We are of the opinion that the appellants' contention is well founded. We see 
no words or phrases in the clauses quoted which lead necessarily to the 
construction placed upon those paragraphs by the learned court below. On the 
other hand, we find expressions which seem to indicate with fair clearness that 
it was the intention of the testatrix to divide her property equally between her 
sisters and nieces. The court below based its construction upon the theory that 
the other construction would be "an admission that the testatrix desired to 
favor her deceased sister Eufemia Uson, who left three children, more than her 
other deceased sister Antonia Uson, who left two children, and moreover both 
would be more favored than any of the other four surviving sisters, one of whom 
was married at the time of the execution of the said codicil-and without doubt 
had children."</p>
<p>As we look at the codicil we observe, first, that the testatrix, in the first 
paragraph thereof, declares that after her husband's death she desires that "my 
sisters <em>and nieces, as hereinafter named,</em> shall succeed him as 
heirs."</p>
<p>We note, in the second place, that the testatrix, in the second paragraph of 
the codicil, names and identifies each one of her heirs then living, or each one 
of the persons whom she desires shall succeed her husband in the property. Among 
those mentioned specifically are the nieces as well as-the sisters. The nieces 
are referred to in no way different from the sisters. Each one stands out in the 
second paragraph of the codicil as clearly as the other and under exactly the 
same conditions. </p>
<p>In the third place, we note, with interest, the last clause of the second 
paragraph of the codicil which, it seems, to us, taken together with the last 
clause of the first paragraph of the codicil, is decisive of the intention of 
the testatrix. In the last clause she says that she names all of the persons 
whom she desires to take under her will by name "so that they may take and enjoy 
the property <em>in equal parts</em> as good sisters <em>and 
relatives.</em>"</p>
<p>We have then in the first paragraph a declaration as to who the testatrix 
desires shall become the owners of her property on the death of her husband. 
Among them we find the names of the nieces as well as of the sisters. We have 
also the final declaration of the testatrix that she desires that the sisters 
and nieces shall take and enjoy the property in equal parts. That being so, it 
appears to us that the testatrix's intention is fairly clear, so clear in fact 
that it is unnecessary to bring in extraneous arguments to reach a conclusion as 
to what she intended.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from is hereby modified by declaring that, of the 
property passing under the codicil herein-above referred to, the living sisters 
and the children of the deceased sisters shall take per capita and in equal 
parts, and as so modified the judgment is affirmed. No costs in this 
instance.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Carson </em>and <em>Araullo, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em>Trent, J</em>., dissents.<br></p></div>
