				G.R. No. 1089, October 31, 1902</h4>
				<H3>ANGEL GUSTILO, PETITIONER, VS. ESTANISLAO YUSAY, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF NEGROS OCCIDENTAL, RESPONDENT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> It can be gathered from the petition that the defendant demurred to  the  complaint; that the demurrer  was overruled;  the case  tried, and  a judgment against the defendant entered on the 30th of August  The defendant presented a so-called bill of exceptions on the 5th of September.   The judge has  failed to sign this  bill and the defendant seeks relief under article 499 of  the Code of Civil Procedure.  His petition states: "I base my exception  upon  the  fact that  our demurrer was overruled." Under article 142  an exception to the order overruling the demurrer should have been taken "forthwith" upon receiving notice thereof.   This does not appear to have been done. The defendant can not wait until after the trial and then for the first time  except  to such an order by including a statement to that effect in his proposed bill of exceptions.</p>
<p> The petition also states that  the defendant appealed from the judgment.  The only way of appealing  from a judgment in an ordinary  action is by presenting an exception to  it, having  that exception  incorporated in a bill of exceptions signed by the judge and certified to this court. (Article 143.)</p>
<p> The petition with the proposed bill of exceptions is very vague and indefinite, and we can not Bay that  by his so-called appeal he intended to present for review any questions other than those raised by his demurrer.</p>
<p> <em> Arellano, C.  J., Torres, Cooper, Smith, Mapa </em>and <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
