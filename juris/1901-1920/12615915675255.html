				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>There is  no competent evidence in the record of this case connecting the appellants with the crime with which they were charged.</p>
<p>The prosecution introduced in evidence written statements purporting to be  confessions of guilt signed and sworn to by each of the appellants before the justice of the peace of Mabalacat, but we are of opinion  that these statements must be excluded because "it does not affirmatively appear that they were "freely and voluntarily made and not the result of  violence,  intimidation,  threats, menace,  or promises  or offers of reward or  leniency." (Sec. 4,  Act No. 619, Philippine Commission.)</p>
<p>The fact  that these  alleged confessions were executed before the justice of the peace was not denied,  but at the trial of  the case in the Court of First Instance the defendants did deny the truth of the facts set out therein and alleged that these confessions were the result of violence, intimidation, and threats on the part of certain Constabulary officers and soldiers and that they were not  freely and voluntarily made.</p>
<p>The justice of the  peace testified  that no improper measures were used while the statements were being executed in his  presence, but the testimony of  the accused was to the effect that these statements were the result of the violence and intimidation to which they were subjected before being brought into his presence, and  it does not appear that he took any  measures to  relieve  their minds of the fear occasioned by any abuse to which they might have been previously  subjected.  Where violence or intimidation has been used to extort a  confession from an accused  person, the mere fact that a confession made by him some time thereafter appears to have been made freely and voluntarily is not  sufficient to justify the  admission of such confession unless it is proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the mind of the accused was wholly relieved of the fear which would naturally ensue from being subjected to such violence or intimidation.</p>
<p>A number of witnesses were introduced by the prosecution in rebuttal of the testimony of the accused, but we do not feel that their evidence was sufficient to sustain a finding that  the accused were not  in fact subjected  to violence  and intimidation while in the hands  of the Constabulary.</p>
<p>Anacleto Antonio, Ignacio Barmiento, and Juan Tullo having died pending their appeal, the complaint is  dismissed as to  them, with their proportionate share of the costs of both  instances <em>de oficio</em>, and the remaining appellants are acquitted of the crime  with which  they are charged,  with their proportionate share  of the costs of both instances <em>de oficio</em>, and they will be  set at  liberty forthwith, and to this end judgment will be entered immediately upon the filing of this decision.   So ordered.</p>
<em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa,</em> and <em>Willard, JJ., </em>concur.
