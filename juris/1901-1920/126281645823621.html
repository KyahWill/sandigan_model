				G.R. No. 2947, October 19, 1906</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE, VS. VICENTE RUIZ, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C.J.: </STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The defendant has been sentenced to five months' imprisonment (<em>arresto mayor</em>) with the accessories of article 61 of the Penal Code, to pay to the New York Life Insurance Co., of this city, the sum of $172.74, United States currency, or its equivalent, P345.58, Philippine currency, or in case of insolvency,  to  suffer subsidiary imprisonment to the extent of one-third of the principal penalty, and to pay the costs.</p>
<p>The defendant has appealed from the judgment, but has pointed out no fundamental error.  Article 535, paragraph 5, of the Penal Code, provides that the crime of <em>estafa</em> is committed by those who, to the prejudice of another, convert or misappropriate money or any other chattel which they may have  received on  deposit, on commission, or for  administration.   The accused misappropriated money received in commission for that company for which he was soliciting agent, to the amount expressed in the judgment. He  has  consequently been guilty  of the crime charged. One of the arguments advanced  by the defendant in  this instance is that he who fails to deliver or return the same thing which  he was under obligation to return or deliver is guilty of <em>estafa</em>, and that as the accused did not receive the  money in question in United States currency, he could not  be guilty of misappropriating it in United States currency.  The court did not convict him for having converted a chattel received other than on commission—that is,  received under any other title than that included  in the words "on  deposit,  on commission, or for administration"—but convicted him for having misappropriated money received on commission.   To this end it was not necessary that he should have failed to deliver the same coins received.   It was sufficient if he failed to deliver the money received under these circumstances.  The  code furthermore punish as guilty of  <em>estafa</em> he who converts to his own use any chattel received by  him,  on deposit, commission,  or  for administration, or by virtue of any other contract from which "arises the obligation of delivering it up, or returning," as  for  example, <em>comodato</em>,  pledge, and  others.   In this  case the delinquent converted a specific thing which it was  his duty to deliver or return.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the case of money, it is a legal  maxim that "one owes 'the same' as one receives, and that 'the same' is  the thing  or amount  itself  or. its proper  equivalent." It is contended by the defense that  no evidence has been introduced in order  to establish the equivalence between the two sums.   This is not correct, inasmuch as the defendant himself, .in his letters to the complaining witness and in his testimony, indicates the rate of exchange upon which he acted in collecting the insurance premiums,  and issuing receipts expressed in United States currency.  It follows, therefore,  that the judgment appealed from is in accordance with law,  with the exception that  the words "fifty- eight cents" should be amended to read "forty-eight cents." The judgment is, therefore, affirmed in its entirety with the costs of this instance.   The  amount of 345.58 pesos in the judgment  is to  be   changed to  345.48  pesos, Philippine currency.</p>
<p>After the expiration of ten days from the entry of judgment the  cause  will  be remanded  for  execution.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres,  Mapa, Johnson, Carson, Willard,</em> and  <em>Tracey, JJ., </em>concur.</p>
