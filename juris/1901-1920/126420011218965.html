				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. HILARIO DE LA CRUZ, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The  guilt of  the defendant and appellant of the  crime of homicide of which he was convicted in the court  below is conclusively established by the evidence of record.</p>
<p>The  trial court was of opinion that its  commission  was not marked by either aggravating or extenuating  circumstances, and sentenced the convict to fourteen years eight months and one  day  of <em>reclusion temporal</em>,  the  medium degree of the penalty prescribed by the code.  But we are of  opinion that  the extenuating  circumstance set out in subsection 7 of article 9 should have been taken into consideration, and  that the prescribed penalty should have been imposed in its minimum degree.  Subsection 7 of article 9 is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The following are extenuating circumstances:</p>
  <p align="center">*       *       *       *      *      *      *</p>
  <p>"That of having acted upon an impulse so powerful as naturally to have produced passion and obfuscation."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The evidence  clearly discloses that the convict, in the heat of passion, killed the deceased, who had theretofore been his <em>querida </em>(concubine or lover) upon discovering her <em>in  flagrante</em>  in  carnal  communication  with  a  mutual acquaintance.  We think that under the circumstances the convict  was entitled to have this fact taken into consideration in  extenuation of his offense under the provisions of the above-cited article. This was the view taken by the supreme court of Spain upon a similar state of facts as set forth in its sentence of July 4,  1892,  which  is summarized by Viada  (p. 69, in question 19, art. 9 of vol. 6) as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Shall he who kills a woman with whom he is living in concubinage for having caught her in her underclothes with another party and afterwards shoots himself, inflicting a serious  wound, be responsible for that  crime with the extenuating circumstance of having acted with violent passion and obfuscation?  The Audiencia of Santiago de Cuba did not so hold and its judgment was reversed by the supreme court for improper disregard of article 9, number 8, of the Penal Code for Cuba and Puerto Rico: 'The facts held to be true by  the trial court, and which were the immediate cause of the crime by producing in the accused strong  emotion which impelled him to the criminal act and even to attempt his own life, were a sufficient impulse in the natural and ordinary course to produce the violent passion and obfuscation which the law regards as a special reason for extenuation, and as the judgment did not take into consideration the 8th circumstance of article 9 of the code, the Audiencia rendering it seems to have violated this legal provision."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is  true that in the  case of  U. S. vs. Hicks (14 Phil. Rep., 217), we held that the "causes which mitigate the criminal responsibility for the loss of self-control are such as originate from legitimate feelings, not those which arise from vicious, unworthy, and immoral passions," and declined to give the benefit of the provisions of this article to the convict in that  case on the ground that the alleged causes for his loss of self-control did not "originate from legitimate feelings."   But  in that case we found as facts that :</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"All the foregoing circumstances conclusively prove that the accused, deliberately and after due reflection  had resolved to kill the woman who had left him for another man, and in order to  accomplish his  perverse intention  with safety, notwithstanding  the fact that he was already provided  with a clean and  well-prepared weapon  and carried other loaded cartridges besides those already in his revolver, he  entered the  house, greeting everyone  courteously and conversed with his victim, in what appeared to be a proper manner,  disguising his  intention  and calming her by his apparent repose and tranquility, doubtless in order to successfully accomplish his  criminal design, behaving himself properly as he had planned to do beforehand."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the former case the cause of the alleged "passion and obfuscation" of the aggressor was the convict's vexation, disappointment and deliberate anger engendered by the refusal of the woman to continue to live in illicit relations with him, which she  had a perfect right to do; his reason for killing her being merely that he had elected to leave him and with his full knowledge to go and live with another man.   In the present case however, the impulse upon which  defendant acted and which naturally "produced passion and obfuscation" was not that the woman declined to have illicit  relations with  him,  but the sudden revelation that she was untrue to him, and his discovery of her <em>in flagrante</em> in the arms of another. As said by  the supreme court of Spain in the above  cited decision, this was a  "sufficient impulse" in the ordinary and natural course of things to produce the passion and  obfuscation which the law  declares to be one of the extenuating circumstances to be taken into consideration by the  court.</p>
<p>Modified by a finding that the commission of the crime was marked with the extenuating circumstance set out in subsection 7 of article 9, and by the reduction of the penalty of fourteen years eight months and one  day of <em>reclusion temporal</em> to twelve years and one day of <em>reclusion temporal</em>, the judgment of conviction and the sentence imposed by the trial court should be and are hereby affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.</p>

<p><strong>MORELAND, J.:</strong></p>
<p>I agree except as to the application of the extenuating circumstance presented by paragraph 7, article 9, Penal Code. In my judgment it is not warranted by the facts or the law.</p>
