				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal brought up by bill of exceptions filed by counsel for the plaintiffs 
from the judgment of April 10, 1913, whereby the Honorable P. M. Moir, judge, 
dismissed the complaint, with the costs against the plaintiffs.
<p>On September 1, 1906, Macario Samson filed in the Court of First Instance of 
Albay a suit for recovery of possession of a tract of land located in Mabaryu, 
of the municipality of Polangui, Albay, from the married couple, Vicenta 
Salvilla and Pascual Sierra, who held it by usurpation. After due trial, the 
court absolved the defendants, declaring that the plaintiff is not the owner of 
the land claimed in the complaint, wherein it was also prayed that said 
defendants be sentenced to pay the plaintiff P1,000 as damages.</p>
<p>A bill of exceptions was brought into this court by virtue of an appeal 
raised by the plaintiff Samson from the judgment of the court below, and such 
appeal having been found to be proper, the court, under date of January 16, 
1909, reversed the judgment appealed from and declared that ownership and 
possession of the land claimed pertained to the plaintiff. Defendants were 
sentenced to deliver and restore possession of the same to the plaintiff, but 
they were absolved from the claim for damages, as neither the existence nor the 
amount thereof had been proven (Samson <em>vs.</em> Salvilla and Sierra, 12 
Phil. Rep., 497).</p>
<p>At this point, as in the meanwhile the said Macario Samson had died, counsel 
for his widow Juliana Solano and their children and only heirs, Domingo Samson 
and Felisa Samson, filed suit on October 24, 1912, to recover rents from the 
said Vicenta Salvilla and Pascual Sierra. He alleged that, by virtue of the 
decision rendered by the Supreme Court, the sheriff of the Province of Albay 
had, on March 10,1909, carried out its mandates by placing the predecessor in 
interest of the plaintiffs in possession of the land in litigation, which the 
defendants had held by usurpation from June, 1906, to March 10, 1909. They had 
tilled it and enjoyed the products thereof but had failed to deliver to the 
owner of the land, the predecessor in interest of the plaintiffs, the third of 
the crops that belonged to the latter in the years 1907, 1908, and 1909. This 
third was the rent of the said land, of which they were only tenants on shares, 
and consisted of 51 trojes and 35 manojos of paddy, -as harvested each year, 
equivalent to 103 cavanes and 10 gantas, worth P413.60 a year. The value of the 
three crops for the years 1907, 1908, and 1909 amounts to the total sum of 
P1,240.80, which was not paid to the deceased Macario Samson in his lifetime, 
nor to his heirs the plaintiffs, although the defendants knew that they were 
obligated to deliver to the owner of the land a third of its products in those 
three years, or the value thereof. They refused to make delivery of the same and 
appropriated the third to their own use, wherefore counsel for the plaintiffs 
asked for judgment ordering the defendants to deliver to the plaintiffs 310 
cavanes and 5 gantas of paddy, or the value thereof, P1,240.80, together with 
the interest on this amount, and to pay the costs of the case;</p>
<p>The demurrer filed to the foregoing complaint by counsel for the defendants 
was overruled on the ground that the plea of <em>res adjudicata</em> cannot be 
set up in a demurrer, but must be alleged as a special defense in answer and 
must be afterwards proven as such. In answer to the complaint, counsel for the 
defendants then denied each and all of the allegations contained therein and not 
expressly admitted in the answer, but he admitted the allegations set forth in 
paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 of the complaint and the documents forming a 
part thereof, marked "A" and "B". He especially denied the allegations in 
paragraphs 7 and 8 thereof.</p>
<p>In special defense he alleged that the subject-matter of this litigation is 
<em>res adjudicata</em> in the civil case No. 636 of the Court of Albay and No. 
4461 of the general docket of the Supreme Court, as appears in the said Exhibits 
A and B, and he therefore prayed the court to absolve the defendants from the 
complaint and to sentence the plaintiffs to pay the costs and forever hold their 
peace.</p>
<p>As a result the court rendered the decision that has been mentioned, 
whereupon counsel for the plaintiffs excepted thereto and appealed by filing the 
corresponding bill of exceptions.</p>
<p>The question arising in this suit is whether the claim for rent, or price of 
leasing the land usurped, which was ordered restored in the said judgment, 
consisting of the third of the products of the said land at the rate of 103 
cavanes and 10 gantas of paddy for each of the three years 1907, 1908 and 1909, 
or the value thereof, P1,240.80, is involved and included in the complaint filed 
in the previous suit and the final judgment rendered therein, and therefore 
whether it has already been finally decided.</p>
<p>In the complaint filed in the previous suit the plaintiff Macario Samson 
asked that the defendants be sentenced to pay him the sum of Pl ,000 as damages, 
and in reversing the judgment appealed from this Court declared that the 
plaintiff Samson was not entitled to such damages as he had not proved the 
existence or the amount thereof.</p>
<p>In the present suit the widow and heirs of Macario Samson pray that the 
defendants be directed to pay them a third of the paddy crop they harvested from 
the land usurped during those three years, which in all amounts to 310 cavanes 
and 5 gantas, the value whereof is P1,240.80, alleging that the defendants 
failed to deliver said third of the products as rent or price of the lease 
stipulated, after presentation in September of 1906 of the complaint in said 
previous suit, up to March, 1909, when possession of the land in question was 
restored to the plaintiff. This claim for rent for these three years cannot be 
regarded as included in the previous suit for recovery, wherein among other 
things payment was demanded from the defendants of the sum of P1,000 as damages, 
for these damages referred to injury done before the filing of the complaint, in 
which no claim was set up with reference to later damages.</p>
<p>Counsel for the defendants alleges that the plaintiff, in fixing the sum of 
P1,000 as the amount of damages caused him, did not specify that they were 
incurred only up to the date of the complaint and he asked for payment thereof 
without any distinction and without reservation of his right to claim damages 
subsequent to the filing of the complaint, since indemnity for damages, although 
it might have two sources, ought to be the subject matter of a single action, 
which cannot be divided merely on account of time. The right of the owner of the 
tract to be indemnified arose and could be enforced from the moment when the 
occupation of the property became illegal on the part of the defendants until 
the time when the owner should be restored to possession, the action being 
single for the reason that the cause thereof, the illegal occupation of the 
property, is single.</p>
<p>In order that a final and executory judgment justify the plea of <em>res 
adjudicata</em> in another suit subsequently instituted, and that such plea be 
admissible, it is indispensable that there exist in both actions identity of 
persons, things and rights of action requisites that must concur in common 
between the first suit already carried to judgment and the one subsequently 
instituted, by showing that in this second suit the complaint is based upon the 
same thing that was the subject matter of the previous litigation, that the same 
ground was alleged and that it was between the same parties. (Bowler 
<em>vs.</em> Estate of Alvarez, 23 Phil. Rep., 561.)</p>
<p>Every question determined by final judgment in a trial before the courts is 
considered <em>res adjudicata.</em> (Civil Code, art. 1252; Code of Civil 
Procedure, sees. 306, 307.) </p>
<p>Identity of the parties litigant does really exist between the previous suit 
finally determined by the decision, Exhibit B, and the present one, for the 
defendants in this suit are the same persons who were sentenced in the preceding 
one to restore possession of the land they held by usurpation, and as Macario 
Samson, the plaintiff in that suit, had died, the claimants in the present 
action are his widow and children, his legal successors in interest to his 
rights to the land in question and to the damages the usurpers of the tract 
caused him.</p>
<p>Likewise identical is the right of action arising from the right to claim 
indemnity for damages caused by said usurpation of the land belonging to the 
plaintiff in the first suit, Macario Samson, to whose rights his heirs, now the 
plaintiffs, have succeeded through his death, since the same ground for seeking 
indemnity for said damages has been alleged in both actions.</p>
<p>But a like identity does not exist in the subject matter of the two suits, 
for in the previous one claim was made upon the defendants for payment of the 
sum of P1,000 as damages caused to the plaintiff from the date of the usurpation 
until that of the complaint, September 1, 1906, by the illegal occupation of the 
land which is the subject matter of the action for recovery of possession; and 
in the present suit it is prayed that the same defendants be sentenced to 
deliver the third of the crops harvested by them from the land they usurped 
during the years 1907, 1908, and 1909, as rent for the tract, which third part 
of the crops amounts to 103 cavanes and 10 gantas of paddy a year, worth 
annually P413.60 and for the three years P1,240.80. The defendants kept that 
third of the products of the land detained during the three years subsequent to 
the action for recovery until the land recovered was, in compliance with the 
judgment of execution, restored to its owner, the predecessor in interest of the 
herein plaintiff.</p>
<p>Accordingly, with respect to damages, the things that were the subject matter 
of the complaint in the first action and those of the claim herein are not the 
same nor are they identical. In the former action indemnity was sought for 
damages caused to the plaintiff from the commencement of the usurpation until 
the date of the complaint, and in the present one payment is demanded of the 
amount of the rent of the land detained, consisting of the third of the crops 
grown during the three years following the complaint, until the land was 
returned to its owner or the value of each of the said crops of paddy was 
paid.</p>
<p>On the supposition therefore, that the subject matter in each case is 
different, the first being with reference to damages, it is evident that there 
is a lack of one of the requisites indispensable to make the result of the first 
suit, as shown by the final judgment, Exhibit B, res adjudicata, in the present 
one, and consequently the absolution of the defendants from the complaint for 
damages, calculated by the plaintiffs at P1,000, is not <em>res adjudicata</em> 
in the present case. Their prayer that the defendants be sentenced to deliver to 
the plaintiffs 310 cavanes and 5 gantas of paddy, or the value thereof, 
P1,240.80, was not made or decided in the previous suit, so it cannot be 
understood to have been duly included in the judgment therein rendered, Exhibit 
B.</p>
<p>This being the case, and as it has been shown in this decision that the 
plaintiffs, successors in interest of Macario Samson, are entitled to claim the 
said quantity of paddy, a third part of the crops of three years or the value 
thereof, from the defendants, whose plea that the claim was finally decided in 
the previous action is inadmissible and as the parties have not introduced their 
respective proofs to show whether or not such crops are owed as rent, trial of 
the case should be proceeded with in first instance for that purpose.</p>
<p>Therefore, the judgment appealed from is set aside, and the case will be 
returned to the court from which it comes, with a certified copy of this 
decision, so that the Court of First Instance may, in accordance with law, 
direct the taking of such evidence as the parties may present in these 
proceedings. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Johnson, Carson, Moreland, Trent</em>, and <em>Araullo, 
JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
