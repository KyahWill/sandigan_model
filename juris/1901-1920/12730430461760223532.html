				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>STREET, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The Orientalist Company is a corporation, duly organized under the laws of 
the Philippine Islands, and in 1913 and 1914, the time of the occurrences which 
gave rise to this lawsuit, was engaged in the business of maintaining and 
conducting a theater in the city of Manila for the exhibition of cinematographic 
films. Under the articles of incorporation the company is authorized to 
manufacture, buy,, or otherwise obtain all accessories necessary for conducting 
such a business. The plaintiff J. F. Ramirez was, at the same time, a resident 
of the city of Paris, France, and was engaged in the business of marketing films 
for a manufacturer or manufacturers, there engaged in the production or 
distribution of cinematographic material. In this enterprise the plaintiff was 
represented in the city of Manila by his son, Jose Ramirez.
<p>In the month of July, 1913, certain of the directors of the Orientalist 
Company, in Manila, became apprised of the fact that the plaintiff in Paris had 
control of the agencies for two different marks of films, namely, the 
"<em>Eclair</em> Films" and the "<em>Milano</em> Films;" and negotiations were 
begun with said officials of the Orientalist Company by Jose Ramirez, as agent 
of the plaintiff, for the purpose of placing the exclusive agency of these films 
in the hands of the Orientalist Company. The defendant Ramon J. Fernandez, one 
of the directors of the Orientalist Company and also its treasurer, was chiefly 
active in this matter, being moved by the suggestions and representations of 
Vicente Ocampo, manager of the Oriental Theater, to the effect that the securing 
of the exclusive agency of said films was necessary to the success of the 
corporation.</p>
<p>Near the end of July of the year aforesaid, Jose Ramirez, as representative 
of his father, placed in the hands of Ramon J. Fernandez an offer, dated July 4, 
1913, stating in detail the terms upon which the plaintiff would undertake to 
supply from Paris the aforesaid films. This offer was declared to be good until 
the end of July; and as only about two days of this period remained, it appeared 
important for the Orientalist Company to act upon the matter speedily, if it 
desired to take advantage of said offer. Accordingly, Ramon J. Fernandez, on 
July 30, had an informal conference with all the members of the company's board 
of directors except one, and with the approval of those with whom he had 
communicated, addressed a letter to Jose Ramirez, in Manila, accepting the offer 
contained in the memorandum of July 4th for the exclusive agency of the 
<em>Eclair</em> films. A few days later, on August 5, he addressed another 
letter couched in the same terms, likewise accepting the offer of the exclusive 
agency for the <em>Milano</em> films.</p>
<p>The memorandum offer contained a statement of the price at which the films 
would be sold, the quantity which the representative of each was required to 
take, and information concerning the manner and intervals of time for the 
respective shipments. The expenses of packing, transportation and other 
incidentals were to be at the cost of the purchaser. There was added a clause in 
which J. F. Ramirez described his function in such transactions as that of a 
commission agent and stated that he would see to the prompt shipment of the 
films, would pay the manufacturer, and take care that the films were insuredâ€”his 
commission for such services being fixed at 5 per cent.</p>
<p>What we consider to be the most material portion of the two letters of 
acceptance written by R. J. Fernandez to Jose Ramirez is in the following 
terms:</p>
<p>"We willingly accepted the offer under the terms communicated by your father 
in his letter dated at Paris on July 4th of the present year."</p>
<p>These communications were signed in the following form, in which it will be 
noted the separate signature of R. J. Fernandez, as an individual, is placed 
somewhat below and to the left of the signature of the Orientalist Company as 
signed by R. J. Fernandez, in the capacity of treasurer:</p>
<p align="right">"The Orientalist Company,<br>"By R. J. 
Fernandez,<br>Treasurer.</p>
<p>"R. J. Fernandez."</p>
<p>Both of these letters also contained a request that Jose Ramirez should at 
once telegraph to his father in Paris that his offer had been accepted by the 
Orientalist Company and instruct him to make a contract with the film companies, 
according to the tenor of the offer, and in the capacity of attorney-in-fact for 
the Orientalist Company. The idea behind the latter suggestion apparently was 
that the contract for the films would have to be made directly between the 
film-producing companies and the Orientalist Company; and it seemed convenient, 
in order to save time, that the Orientalist Company should clothe J. F. Ramirez 
with full authority as its attorney-in-fact. This idea was never given effect; 
and so far as the record shows, J. F. Ramirez himself procured the films upon 
his own responsibility, as he indicated in the offer of July 4 that he would do, 
with the result that the only contracting parties in this case are J. F. 
Ramirez, of the one part, and the Orientalist Company, with Ramon J. Fernandez, 
of the other.</p>
<p>In due time the films began to arrive in Manila, a draft for the cost and 
expenses incident to each shipment being attached to the proper bill of lading. 
It appears that the Orientalist Company was without funds to meet these 
obligations and the first few drafts were dealt with in the following manner: 
The drafts, upon presentment through the bank, were accepted in the name of the 
Orientalist Company by its president B. Hernandez, and were taken up by the 
latter with his own funds. As the drafts had thus been paid by B. Hernandez, the 
films which had been procured by the payment of said drafts were treated by him 
as his own property; and they in fact never came into the actual possession of 
the Orientalist Company as owner at all, though it is true Hernandez rented the 
films to the Orientalist Company and they were exhibited by it in the Oriental 
Theater under an arrangement which was made between him and the theater's 
manager.</p>
<p>During the period between February 27, 1914, and April 30, 1914, there 
arrived in the city of Manila several remittances of films from Paris, and it is 
these shipments which have given occasion for the present action. All of the 
drafts accompanying these films were drawn, as on former occasions, upon the 
Orientalist Company; and all were accepted in the name of the Orientalist 
Company by its president, B. Hernandez, except the last, which was accepted by 
B. Hernandez individually. None of the drafts thus accepted were taken up by the 
drawee or by B. Hernandez when they fell due; and it was finally necessary for 
the plaintiff himself to take them up as dishonored by nonpayment.</p>
<p>Thereupon this action was instituted by the plaintiff on May 19, 1914, 
against the Orientalist Company, and Ramon J. Fernandez. As the films which 
accompanied the dishonored drafts were liable to deteriorate, the court, upon 
application of the plaintiff, and apparently without opposition on the part of 
the defendants, appointed a receiver who took charge of the films and sold them. 
The amount realized from this sale was applied to the satisfaction of the 
plaintiff's claim and was accordingly delivered to him in part payment thereof. 
At trial judgment was given for the balance due to the plaintiff, namely, 
P6,018.93, with interest from May 19, 1914, the date of the institution of the 
action. In the judgment of the trial court the Orientalist Company was declared 
to be a principal debtor and Ramon J. Fernandez was declared to be liable 
subsidiarily as guarantor. From this judgment both of the parties defendant 
appealed.</p>
<p>In this Court neither of the parties appellant make any question with respect 
to the right of the plaintiff to recover from somebody the amount awarded by the 
lower court; but each of the defendants insists the other is liable for the 
whole. It results that the real contention upon this appeal is between the two 
defendants.</p>
<p>It is stated in the brief of the appellant Ramon J. Fernandez, and the 
statement is not challenged by the Orientalist Company, that the judgment has 
already been executed as against the company and that the full amount has been 
made, so that if this Court should find that the Orientalist Company is 
exclusively and primarily liable for the entire indebtedness, the question as to 
the liability of Ramon J. Fernandez would be academic. But if the latter is 
liable as principal obligor for the whole or any part of the debt, it will be 
necessary to modify the judgment in order to adjust the rights of the defendants 
in accordance with such finding.</p>
<p>It will be noted that the action is primarily founded upon the liability 
created by the letters dated July 30th and August 5, 1913, in connection with 
the plaintiff's offer of July 4, 1913; and both of the letters mentioned are 
copied into the complaint as the foundation of the action. The action is not 
based upon the dishonored drafts which were accepted by B. Hernandez in the name 
of the Orientalist Company; and although these drafts, as well as the last 
draft, which was accepted by B. Hernandez individually, have been introduced in 
evidence, this was evidently done for the purpose of proving the amount of 
damages which the plaintiff was entitled to recover.</p>
<p>In the discussion which is to follow we shall consider, first, the question 
of the liability of the corporation upon the contracts contained in the letters 
of July 30 and August 5, 1913, and, secondly, the question of the liability of 
Ramon J. Fernandez, based upon his personal signature to the same documents.</p>
<p>As to the liability of the corporation a preliminary point of importance 
arises upon the pleadings. The action, as already stated, is based upon 
documents purporting to be signed by the Orientalist Company, and copies of the 
documents are set out in the complaint. It was therefore incumbent upon the 
corporation, if it desired to question the authority of Fernandez to bind it, to 
deny the due execution of said contracts under oath, as prescribed in section 
103 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Said section, in the part pertinent to the 
situation now under consideration, reads as follows:</p>
<p>"When an action is brought upon a written instrument and the complaint 
contains or has annexed a copy of such instrument, the genuineness and due 
execution of the instrument shall be deemed admitted, unless specifically denied 
under oath in the answer."</p>
<p>No sworn answer denying the genuineness and due execution of the contracts in 
question or questioning the authority of Ramon J. Fernandez to bind the 
Orientalist Company was filed in this case; but evidence was admitted without 
objection from the plaintiff, tending to show that Ramon J. Fernandez had no 
such authority. This evidence consisted of extracts from the minutes of the 
proceedings of the company's board of directors and also of extracts from the 
minutes of the proceedings of the company's stockholders, showing that the 
making of this contract had been under consideration in both bodies and that the 
authority to make the same had been withheld by the stockholders. It therefore 
becomes necessary for us to consider whether the admission resulting from the 
failure of the defendant company to deny the execution of the contracts under 
oath is binding upon it for all purposes of this lawsuit, or whether such 
failure should be considered a mere irregularity of procedure which was waived 
when the evidence referred to was admitted without objection from the plaintiff. 
The proper solution of this problem makes it necessary to consider carefully the 
principle underlying the provision above quoted.</p>
<p>That the situation was one in which an answer under oath denying the 
authority of the agent should have been interposed, supposing that the company 
desired to contest this point, is not open to question. In the case of Merchant 
vs. International Banking Corporation (6 Phil. Rep., 314), it appeared that one 
Brown had signed the name of the defendant bank as guarantor of a promissory 
note. The bank was sued upon this guaranty and at the hearing attempted to prove 
that Brown had no authority to bind the bank by such contract. It was held that, 
by failing to deny the contract under oath, the bank had admitted the 
genuineness and due execution thereof, and that this admission extended not only 
to the authenticity of the signature of Brown but also to his authority. Said 
Justice Willard: "The failure of the defendant to deny the genuineness and due 
execution of this guaranty under oath was an admission, not only of the 
signature of Brown, but also of his authority to make the contract in behalf of 
the defendant and of the power of the defendant to enter into such a 
contract."</p>
<p>The rule thus stated is in entire accord with the doctrine prevailing in the 
United States, as will be seen by reference to the following, among other 
authorities:</p>
<p>The case of Barrett Mining Co. <em>vs</em>. Tappan (2 Colo., 124) was an 
action against a corporation upon an appeal bond. The name of the company had 
been affixed to the obligation by an agent, and no sufficient affidavit was 
filed by the corporation questioning its signature or the authority of the agent 
to bind the company. It was held that the plaintiff did not have to prove the 
due execution of the bond and that the corporation was to be taken as admitting 
the authority of the agent to make the signature. Among other things the court 
said: "But it is said that the authority of Barrett to execute the bond is 
distinguishable from the signing and, although the signature must be denied 
under oath, the authority of the agent need not be. Upon this we observe that 
the statute manifestly refers to the legal effect of the signature, rather than 
the manual act of signing. If the name of the obligor, in a bond, is subscribed 
by one in his presence, and by his direction, the effect is the same as if his 
name should be signed with his own hand, and under such circumstances we do not 
doubt that the obligor must deny his signature under oath, in order to put the 
obligee to proof of the fact. <em>Quit facit per aliam facit per se</em>, and 
when the name is signed by one thereunto authorized, it is as much the signature 
of the principal as if written with his own hand. Therefore, if the principal 
would deny the authority of the agent, as the validity of the signature is 
thereby directly attacked, the denial must be under oath."</p>
<p>In Union Dry Company <em>vs</em>. Reid (26 Ga., 107), an action was brought 
upon a promissory note purporting to have been given by one A. B., as the 
treasurer of the defendant company. Said the court: "Under the Judiciary Act of 
1799, requiring the defendant to deny on oath an instrument of writing, upon 
which he is sued, the plea in this case should have been verified.</p>
<p>If the person who signed this note for the company, and upon which they are 
sued, was not authorized to make it, let them say so upon oath, and the 
<em>onus</em> is then on the plaintiff to overcome the plea."</p>
<p>It should be noted that the provision contained in section 103 of our Code of 
Civil Procedure is embodied in some form or other in the statutes of probably 
all of the American States, and it is not by any means peculiar to the laws of 
California, though it appears to have been taken immediately from the statutes 
of that State. (Secs. 447 448, California Code of Civil Procedure.)</p>
<p>There is really a broader question here involved than that which relates 
merely to the formality of verifying the answer with an affidavit. This question 
arises from the circumstance that the answer of the corporation does not in any 
way challenge the authority of Ramon J. Fernandez to bind it by the contracts in 
question and does not set forth, as a special defense, any such lack of 
authority in him. Upon well established principles of pleading lack of authority 
in an officer of a corporation to bind it by a contract executed by him in its 
name is a defense which should be specially pleadedâ€”and this quite apart from 
the requirement, contained in section 103, that the answer setting up such 
defense should be verified, by oath. But it should not here escape observation 
that section 103 also requiresâ€”in conformity with the general principle above 
statedâ€”that tha denial contemplated in that section shall be specific. An attack 
on the instrument in general terms is insufficient, even though the answer is 
under oath. (Songco <em>vs</em>. Sellner, 37 Phil. Rep., 254.)</p>
<p>In the first edition of a well-known treatise on the law of corporations we 
find the following proposition:</p>
<p>"If an action is brought against a corporation upon a contract alleged to be 
its contract, if it desires to set up the defense that the contract was executed 
by one not authorized as its agent, it must plead <em>non est factum</em>." 
(Thompson on Corporations, 1st ed., vol. 6, sec. 7631.)</p>
<p>Again, says the same author:</p>
<p>"A corporation can not avail itself of the defense that it had no power to 
enter into the obligation to enforce which the suit is brought, unless it pleads 
that defense. This principle applies equally where the defendant intends to 
challenge the power of its officer or agent to execute in its behalf the 
contract upon which the action is brought and where it intends to defend on the 
ground of a total want of power in the corporation to make such a contract." 
(Opus citat. sec. 7619.)</p>
<p>In Simon <em>vs</em>. Calfee (80 Ark., 65), it was said:</p>
<p>"Though the power of the officers of a business corporation to issue 
negotiable paper in its name is not presumed, such corporation can not avail 
itself of a want of power in its officers to bind it unless the defense was made 
on such ground."</p>
<p>The rule has been applied where the question was whether a corporate officer, 
having admitted power to make a contract, had in the particular instance 
exceeded that authority, (Merrill <em>vs</em>. Consumers' Coal Co., 114 N. Y., 
216); and it has been held that where the answer in a suit against a corporation 
on its note relies simply on the want of power of the corporation to issue 
notes, the defendant can not afterwards object that the plaintiff has not shown 
that the officers executing the note were empowered to do so. (Smith 
<em>vs</em>. Eureka Flour Mills Co., 6 Cal., 1.)</p>
<p>The reason for the rule enunciated in the foregoing authorities will, we 
think, be readily appreciated. In dealing with corporations the public at large 
is bound to rely to a large extent upon outward appearances. If a man is found 
acting for a corporation with the external indicia of authority, any person, not 
having notice of want of authority, may usually rely upon those appearances; and 
if it be found that the directors had permitted the agent to exercise that 
authority and thereby held him out as a person competent to bind the 
corporation, or had acquiesced in a contract and retained the benefit supposed 
to have been conferred by it, the corporation will be bound, notwithstanding the 
actual authority may never have been granted. The public is not supposed nor 
required to know the transactions which happen around the table where the 
corporate board of directors or the stockholders are from time to time convoked. 
Whether a particular officer actually possesses the authority which he assumes 
to exercise is frequently known to very few, and the proof of it usually is not 
readily accessible to the stranger who deals with the corporation on the faith 
of the ostensible authority exercised by some of the corporate officers. It is 
therefore reasonable, in a case where an officer of a corporation has made a 
contract in its name, that the corporation should be required, if it denies his 
authority, to state such defense in its answer. By this means the plaintiff is 
apprised of the fact that the agent's authority is contested; and he is given an 
opportunity to adduce evidence showing either that the authority existed or that 
the contract was ratified and approved.</p>
<p>We are of the opinion that the failure of the defendant corporation to make 
any issue in its answer with regard to the authority of Ramon J. Fernandez to 
bind it, and particularly its failure to deny specifically under oath the 
genuineness and due execution of the contracts sued upon, have the effect of 
eliminating the question of his authority from the case, considered as a matter 
of mere pleading. The statute (sec. 103) plainly says that if a written 
instrument, the foundation of the suit, is not denied upon oath, it shall be 
deemed to be admitted. It is familiar doctrine that an admission made in a 
pleading can not be controverted by the party making such admission; and all 
proof submitted by him contrary thereto or inconsistent therewith should simply 
be ignored by the court, whether objection is interposed by the opposite party 
or not. We can see no reason why a constructive admission, created by the 
express words of the statute, should be considered to have less effect than any 
other admission.</p>
<p>The parties to an action are required to submit their respective contentions 
to the court in their complaint and answer. Theise documents supply the 
materials which the court musMise in order to discover the points of contention 
between the parties; and where the statute says that the due execution of a 
document which supplies the foundation of an action is to be taken as admitted 
unless denied under oath, the failure of the defendant to make such denial must 
be taken to operate as a conclusive admission, so long as the pleadings remain 
in that form.</p>
<p>It is true that it is declared in section 109 of the Code of Civil Procedure 
that immaterial variances between the allegations of a pleading and the proof 
shall be disregarded and the facts shall be found according to the evidence. The 
same section, however, recognizes the necessity for an amendment of the 
pleadings, in all cases where the variance is substantial, to bring them into 
conformity with the facts proved. That section has, in our opinion, by no means 
abrogated th6 general and fundamental principle that relief can only be granted 
upon matters which are put in issue by the pleadings. A judgment must be in 
conformity with the case made in the pleadings and established by the proof, and 
relief can not be granted that is substantially inconsistent with either. A 
party can no more succeed upon a case proved but not alleged than upon a case 
alleged but not proved. This rule, of course, operates with like effect upon 
both parties, and applies equally to the defendant's special defense as to the 
plaintiff's cause of action.</p>
<p>Of course this Court, under section 109 of the Code of Civil Procedure, has 
authority even now to permit the answer of the defendant to be amended; and if 
we believed that the interests of justice so required, we would either exercise 
that authority or remand the cause for a new trial in the court below. As will 
appear further on in this opinion, however, we think that the interests of 
justice will best be promoted by deciding the case, without more ado, upon the 
issues presented in the record as it now stands.</p>
<p>That we may not appear to have overlooked the matter, we will observe that 
two cases are cited from California in which the Supreme Court of the State has 
held that where a release is pleaded by way of defense and evidence tending to 
destroy its effect is introduced without objection, the circumstance that it was 
not denied under oath is immaterial. In the earlier of these cases, Crowley vs. 
Railroad Co. (60 Cal., 628), an action was brought against a railroad company to 
recover damages for the death of the plaintiff's minor son, alleged to have been 
killed by the negligence of the defendant. The defendant company pleaded by way 
of defense a release purporting to be signed by the plaintiff, and in its answer 
inserted a copy of the release. The execution of the release was not denied 
under oath; but at the trial evidence was submitted on behalf of the plaintiff 
tending to show that at the time he signed the release, he was incompetent by 
reason of drunkenness to bind himself thereby. It was held that inasmuch as this 
evidence had been submitted by the plaintiff without objection, it was proper 
for the court to consider it We do not question the propriety of that decision, 
especially as the issue had been passed upon by a jury; but we believe that the 
decision would have been more soundly planted if it had been said that the 
incapacity of the plaintiff, due to his drunken condition, was a matter which 
did not involve either the genuineness or due execution of the release. Like the 
defenses of fraud, coercion, imbecility, and mistake, it was a matter which 
could be proved under the general issue and did not have to be set up in a sworn 
reply. (Cf. Moore <em>vs</em>. Copp, 119 Cal., 429, 432, 433.) A somewhat 
similar explanation can, we think, be given of the case of Clark <em>vs</em>. 
Child (66 Cal., 87), in which the rule declared in the earlier case was 
followed. With respect to both decision's we merely observe that upon the point 
of procedure which they are supposed to maintain, the reasoning of the court is 
in our opinion unconvincing.</p>
<p>We shall now consider the liability of the defendant company on the merits 
just as if that liability had been properly put in issue by a specific answer 
under oath denying the authority of Fernandez to bind it. Upon this question it 
must at the outset be premised that Ramon J. Fernandez, as treasurer, had no 
independent authority to bind the company by signing its name to the letters in 
question. It is declared in section 28 of the Corporation Law that corporate 
powers shall be exercised, and all corporate business conducted by the board of 
directors; and this principle is recognized in the by-laws of the corporation in 
question which contain a provision declaring that the power to make contracts 
shall be vested in the board of directors. It is true that it is also declared 
in the same by-laws that the president shall have the power, and it shall be his 
duty, to sign contracts; but this has reference rather to the formality of 
reducing to proper form the contracts which are authorized by the board and is 
not intended to confer an independent power to make contracts binding on the 
corporation.</p>
<p>The fact that the power to make corporate contracts is thus vested in the 
board of directors does not signify that a formal vote of the board must always 
be taken before contractual liability can be fixed upon a corporation; for the 
board can create liability, like an individual, by other means than by a formal 
expression of its will. In this connection the case of Robert Gair Co. 
<em>vs</em>. Columbia Rice Packing Co. (124 La., 194) is instructive. It there 
appeared that the secretary of the defendant corporation had signed an 
obligation on its behalf binding it as guarantor of the performance of an 
important contract upon which the name of another corporation appeared as 
principal. The defendant company set up by way of defense that its secretary had 
no authority to bind it by such an engagement. The court found that the guaranty 
was given with the knowledge and consent of the president and directors, and 
that this consent was given with as much observance of formality as was 
customary in the transaction of the business of the company. It was held that, 
so far as the authority of the secretary was concerned, the contract was 
binding. In discussing this point, the court quoted with approval the following 
language from one of its prior decisions:</p>
<p>"The authority of the subordinate agent of a corporation often depends upon 
the course of dealings which the company or its directors have sanctioned. It 
may be established sometimes without reference to official record of the 
proceedings of the board, by proof of the usage which the company had permitted 
to grow up in the business, and of the acquiescence of the board charged with 
the duty of supervising1 and controlling the company's business."</p>
<p>It appears in evidence, in the case now before us, that on July 30, the date 
upon which the letter accepting the offer of the Eclair films was dispatched, 
the board of directors of the Orientalist Company convened in special session in 
the office of Ramon J. Fernandez at the request of the latter. There were 
present the four members, including the president, who had already signified 
their consent to the making of the contracts. At this meeting, as appears from 
the minutes, Fernandez informed the board of the offer which had been received 
from the plaintiff with reference to the importation of films. The minutes add 
that the terms of this offer were approved; but at the suggestion of Fernandez 
it was decided to call a special meeting of the stockholders to consider the 
matter, and definitive action was postponed.</p>
<p>The stockholders meeting was convoked upon September 18, 1913, upon which 
occasion Fernandez informed those present of the offer in question and of the 
terms upon which the films could be procured. He estimated that the company 
would have to make an outlay of about P5,500 per month, if the offer for the two 
films should be accepted by it.</p>
<p>The following extracts from the minutes of this meeting are here 
pertinent:</p>
<p>"Mr. Fernandez informed the stockholders that, in view of the urgency of the 
matter and for the purpose of avoiding that other importers should get ahead of 
the corporation in this regard, he and Messrs. B. Hernandez, Leon Monroy, and 
Dr. Papa met for the purpose of considering the acceptance of the offer together 
with the responsibilities attached thereto, made to the corporation by the film 
manufacturers of <em>Eclair</em> and <em>Milano</em> of Paris and Italy 
respectively, inasmuch as the first shipment of films was then expected to 
arrive.</p>
<p>"At the same time he informed the said stockholders that he had already made 
arrangements with respect to renting said films after they have been once 
exhibited in the Cine Oriental, and that the corporation could very well meet 
the expenditure involved and net a certain profit, but that, if we could enter 
into a contract with about nine cinematographs, big gains would be obtained 
through such a step."</p>
<p>The possibility that the corporation might not see fit to authorize the 
contract, or might for lack of funds be unable to make the necessary outlay, was 
foreseen; and in such contingency, the stockholders were informed, that the four 
gentlemen above mentioned (Hernandez, Fernandez, Monroy, and Papa) "would 
continue importing said films at their own account and risk, and shall be 
entitled only to a compensation of 10 per cent of their outlay in importing the 
films, said payment to be made in shares of said corporation, inasmuch as the 
corporation is lacking available funds for the purpose, and also because there 
are 88 shares of stock remaining still unsold."</p>
<p>In view of this statement, the stockholders adopted a resolution to the 
effect that the agencies of the Eclair and Milano films should be accepted, if 
the corporation could obtain the money with which to meet the expenditure 
involved, and to this end appointed a committee to apply to the bank for a 
credit. The evidence shows that an attempt was made, on behalf of the 
corporation, to obtain a credit of P10,000 from the Bank of the Philippine 
Islands for the purpose indicated, but that the bank declined to grant this 
credit. Thereafter another special meeting of the shareholders of the defendant 
corporation was called at which the failure of their committee to obtain a 
credit from the bank was made known. A resolution was thereupon passed to the 
effect that the company should pay to Hernandez. Fernandez, Monroy, and Papa an 
amount equal to 10 per cent of their outlay in importing the films, said payment 
to be made in shares of the company in accordance with the suggestion made at 
the previous meeting. At the time this meeting was held three shipment of the 
films had already been received in Manila.</p>
<p>We believe it is a fair inference from the recitals of the minutes of the 
stockholder's meeting of September 18, and especially from the first paragraph 
above quoted, that this body was then cognizant that the offer had already been 
accepted in the name of the Orientalist Company and that the films which were 
then expected to arrive were being imported by virtue of such acceptance. 
Certainly four members of the board of directors there present were aware of 
this fact, as the letters accepting the offer had been sent with their knowledge 
and consent. In view of this circumstance, a certain doubt arises whether the 
stockholders meant by their final resolution really to repudiate the contracts 
which had been made in the name of the company or whether tliey meant to utilize 
the financial assistance of the four so-called importers in order that the 
corporation might get the benefit of the contracts for the films, just as it 
would have utilized the credit of the bank if such credit had been extended. If 
such was the intention of the stock- holders their action amounted to a virtual, 
though indirect, approval of the contracts. It is not, however, necessary to 
found the judgment on this interpretation of the stock-holder's proceedings, 
inasmuch as we think, for reasons presently to be stated, that the corporation 
is bound, and we will here assume that in the end the contracts were not 
approved by the stockholders.</p>
<p>It will be observed that Ramon J. Fernandez was the particular officer and 
member of the board of directors who was most active in the effort to secure the 
films for the corporation. The negotiations were conducted by him with the 
knowledge and consent of other members of the board; and the contract was made 
with their prior approval. As appears from the papers in this record, Fernandez 
was the person to whose keeping was confided the printed stationery bearing the 
official style of the corporation, as well as a rubber stencil with which the 
name of the corporation could be signed to documents bearing its name.</p>
<p>Ignoring now, for a moment, the transactions of the stock-holders, and 
reverting to the proceedings of the board of directors of the Orientalist 
Company, we find that upon October 27, 1913, after Fernandez had departed from 
the Philippine Islands, to be absent for many months, said board adopted a 
resolution conferring the following among other powers on Vicente Ocampo, the 
manager of the Oriental theater, namely:</p>
<p>"(1) To rent a box for the films in the 'Kneedler Building.'</p>
<p>"(4) To be in charge of the films and of the renting of the same.</p>
<p>"(5) To advertise in the different newspapers that we are importing films to 
be exhibited in the Cine Oriental.</p>
<p>"(6) Not to deliver any film for rent without first receiving the rental 
therefor or the guaranty for the payment thereof.</p>
<p>"(7) To buy a book and cards for indexing the names of the films.</p>
<p>"(10) Upon the motion of Mr. Ocampo, it was decided to give ample powers to 
the Hon. R. AcuÃ±a to enter into agreements with cinematograph proprietors in the 
provinces for the purpose of renting films from us."</p>
<p>It thus appears that the board of directors, before the financial inability 
of the corporation to proceed with the project was revealed, had already 
recognized the contracts as being in existence and had proceeded to take the 
steps necessary to utilize the films. Particularly suggestive is the direction 
given at this meeting for the publication of announcements in the newspapers to 
the effect that the company was engaged in importing films. In the light of all 
the circumstances of the case, we are of the opinion that the contracts in 
question were thus inferentially approved by the company's board of directors 
and that the company is bound unless the subsequent failure of the stockholders 
to approve said contracts had the effect of abrogating the liability thus 
created.</p>
<p>Both upon principle and authority it is clear that the action of the 
stockholders, whatever its character, must be ignored. The functions of the 
stockholders of a corporation are, it must be remembered, of a limited nature. 
The theory of a corporation is that the stockholders may have all the profits 
but shall turn over the complete management of the enterprise to their 
representatives and agents, called directors. Accordingly there is little for 
the stockholders to do beyond electing directors, making by-laws, and exercising 
certain other special powers defined by law. In conformity with this idea it is 
settled that contracts between a corporation and third persons must be made by 
the directors and not by the stockholders. The corporation, in such matters, is 
represented by the former and not by the latter. (Cook on Corporations, sixth 
ed., sees. 708, 709.) This conclusion is entirely accordant with the provisions 
of section 28 of our Corporation Law already referred to. It results that where 
a meeting of the stockholders is called for the purpose of passing on the 
propriety of making a corporate contract, its resolutions are at most advisory 
and not in any wise binding on the board.</p>
<p>In passing upon the liability of a corporation in cases of this kind it is 
always well to keep in mind the situation as it presents itself to the third 
party with whom the contract is made. Naturally he can have little or no 
information as to what occurs in corporate meetings; and he must necessarily 
rely Upon the external manifestations of corporate consent. The integrity of 
commercial transactions can only be maintained by holding the corporation 
strictly to the liability fixed upon it by its agents in accordance with law; 
and we would be sorry to announce a doctrine which would permit the property of 
a man in the city of Paris to be whisked out of his hands and carried into a 
remote quarter of the earth without recourse against the corporation whose name 
and authority had been used in the manner disclosed in this case. As already 
observed, it is familiar doctrine that if a corporation knowingly permits one of 
its officers, or any other agent, to do acts within the scope of an apparent 
authority, and thus holds him out to the public as possessing power to do those 
acts, the corporation will, as against any one who has in good faith dealt with 
the corporation through such agent, be estopped from denying his authority; and 
where it is said "if the corporation permits" this means the same as "if the 
thing is permitted by the directing power of the corporation."</p>
<p>It being determined that the corporation is bound by the contracts in 
question, it remains to consider the character of the liability assumed by Ramon 
J. Fernandez, in affixing his personal signature to said contracts. The question 
here is whether Fernandez is liable jointly with the Orientalist Company as a 
principal obligor, or whether his liability is that of a guarantor merely.</p>
<p>As appears upon the face of the contracts, the signature of Fernandez, in his 
individual capacity, is not in line with the signature of the Orientalist 
Company, but is set off to the left of the company's signature and somewhat 
below. Observation teaches that it is customary for persons who sign contracts 
in some capacity other than that of principal obligor to place their signatures 
to one side; but we hardly think that this circumstance alone would justify a 
court in holding that Fernandez here took upon himself the responsibility of a 
guarantor rather than that of a principal obligor. We do, however, think that 
the form in which the contract is signed raises a doubt as to what the real 
intention was; and we feel justified, in looking to the evidence to discover 
that intention. In this connection it is entirely clear, from the testimony of 
both Ramirez and Ramon J. Fernandez, that the responsibility of the latter was 
intended to be that of a guarantor. There is, to be sure, a certain difference 
between these witnesses as to the nature of this guaranty, inasmuch as Fernandez 
would have us believe that his name was signed as a guaranty that the contract 
would be approved by the corporation, while Ramirez says that the name was put 
on the contract for the purpose of guaranteeing, not the approval of the 
contract, but its performance. We are convinced that the latter was the real 
intention of the contracting parties.</p>
<p>We are not unmindful of the force of that rule of law which declares that 
oral evidence is inadmissible to vary the effect of a written contract. But it 
must be remembered that ambiguities with respect to the meaning of the language 
used by the parties may be explained by parol evidence and we see no reason why 
an ambiguity arising, as in this case, from the form in which the contract was 
signed may not be explained in the same way. It is certainly the duty of a court 
to seek the means of giving effect to the intention of the contracting parties 
rather than to seek pretexts for defeating it.</p>
<p>If the name of a person not interested in the performance of these contracts 
had appeared written in the place where the name of Ramon J. Fernandez is 
signed, and the evidence had shown that such name was there written merely to 
attest the signature of the corporation, or of Ramon J. Fernandez as treasurer, 
no court would have had any hesitation in holding that no liability had been 
incurred though words were wanting to show how the name was signed.</p>
<p>We are of the opinion that where a name is signed ambiguously, parol Evidence 
is admissible to show the character in which the signature was affixed. This 
conclusion is perhaps supported by the language of the second paragraph of 
article 1281 of the Civil Code, which declares that if the words of a contract 
should appear contrary to the evident intention of the parties, the intention 
shall prevail. But the conclusion reached is, we think, deducible from the 
general principle that in case of ambiguity parol evidence is admissible to show 
the intention of the contracting parties.</p>
<p>It should be stated in conclusion that as the issues in this case have been 
framed, the only question presented to this court is: To what extent are the 
signatory parties to the contract liable to the plaintiff J. F. Ramirez? No 
contentious issue is raised directly between the defendants, the Orientalist 
Company and Ramon J. Fernandez; nor does the present action involve any question 
as to the undertaking of Fernandez and his three associates to effect the 
importation of the films upon their own account and risk. Whether they may be 
bound to hold the company harmless is a matter upon which we express no 
opinion.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs equally against the two 
appellants. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Johnson, Malcolm, AvanceÃ±a</em>, and <em>Fisher, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p></div>
