				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>One Seldner made three different contracts with  th.e defendant for the sale to the latter of certain merchandise. This merchandise Seldner procured to  be sent to Manila from the United States after  the contracts were made.</p>
<ol>
  <li> The  price of  the goods involved in the first contract was $1,641.95.   The defendant received and paid for goods amounting  to $446.32.   The  remainder  of the  goods, amounting in value to $1,195.63, he failed to take or pay for.  At the request  of the defendant, Seldner sold these goods for account  of the defendant for $1,052.95, at a loss, therefore, of $142.68.   Seldner paid freight and duties on the goods, which by the terms of the contract, the defendant was required to pay.  Upon this contract, which is set out in the first cause of  action, the defendant is bound to pay $306.53, the amount claimed therein as damages  for his failure to take and pay for the goods.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> The  second contract related to watches of the value of $359.28, which  the plaintiff did  not take nor pay for. Seldner sold a part of them, and received therefor $355, a loss, therefore, of $4.28.  It appears, however, that this sum of $355 was the price of a part of the watches only. How many watches Seldner still has, which he did not sell, does not appear.  It  does not appear but that those still kept by him would reimburse him for the price of the whole, and the money paid by him  for duties.  It is not proved, therefore, that any damage was suffered by him by reason of  the failure of the defendant to take and pay for the watches.  There can be no recovery upon this second cause of action.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> The third cause of action relates to two orders given by the defendant  to  Seldner for merchandise.  Concerning one of these amounting to $182.40, there is no dispute, since  the  defendant  received and  paid  for these goods.</li>
</ol>
<p>The  contest between the parties arises over  the order amounting to $385.69.  The merchandise arrived in Manila in January or  February,  1903.  It remained  in the custom-house until some time in June of that year.  The defendant then paid the duties, and the goods were taken to the office of the plaintiff, where they were  kept until the 8th of October of that year.  On that day the defendant stated to Seldner that he was prepared to take  and pay for them, but when  the boxes were opened and examined it appeared that fifty-eight pairs  of  shoes were  missing. The defendant thereupon refused  to take or pay for any of the goods.   Seldner then sold the goods to third persons at a profit, but it does not appear at what profit, and he now seeks to recover in this cause of action the  value of the fifty-eight pairs  of shoes which were lost.</p>
<p>We do not think the evidence in the case is sufficient to show that the defendant is responsible for this loss.  He never had  possession of the goods.  It  does not appear whether the fifty-eight pairs of shoes were lost while the goods were in the store of Seldner, or while  they were in the custom-house, or during the voyage, nor does it appear whether they were ever placed  in the boxes in the United States.   That the goods remained so long  in the custom-house and in the office of Seldner was due, perhaps, to the failure of the defendant to take and pay  for  them, but, as has been  said, there is no proof that  the  fifty-eight pairs disappeared during that time.   There is no  proof, therefore, that this failure of the defendant was the cause of the loss.</p>
<ol start="4">
  <li> The complaint  contains a fourth  cause  of action, which is for  services rendered by Seldner in selling the goods after the defendant had refused to take them.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the reasons above stated, there can be no recovery for any  such services rendered in connection with the goods mentioned in the second and third causes of action. As to the goods mentioned in the first cause of  action, we think it is  proved that they  were  sold by Seldner  at the request of the defendant.   Seldner was in the commission business, and the defendant, under the circumstances, was bound to pay him a  reasonable price for his services.  In view of  all the evidence in the case we fix that price at the sum  of $50.</p>
<ol start="5">
  <li>This action was brought by Salvador Brocal.  The complaint alleges the making of various contracts between Seldner  and the defendant, and the performance of services by Seldner in a sale of  the goods.  It then alleges a  sale and assignment of all the causes of action by Seldner  to the  plaintiff.  At the trial  it  appeared that the plaintiff paid  Seldner nothing  for  this assignment, and that Seldner was still the owner of the claim, and was the real party  in interest in the suit.   In his answer the defendant set up a counterclaim for damages suffered by him by reason of Seldner's failure to deliver the goods to him within the  time required by the contract.  During the trial and after it had appeared that Seldner was the real party in interest, the following colloquy took place between counsel and the court:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Counsel for Defendant.  I  can  not  get judgment against Mr. Seldner unless he is made a party to this suit. "Counsel for Plaintiff. I  have no objection.  I ask the court that  Mr. Phil Seldner be  made a party  to the suit.</p>
  <p>"Counsel for Defendant. I object at this time.</p>
  <p>"The Court.  Upon application of the plaintiff's attorney to make  Phil Seldner a party plaintiff, the court is of the opinion  that he is a necessary party, being a party in interest,  and it is ordered by the court that he be made a party plaintiff  in this case.</p>
  <p>"Counsel for Defendant. Exception."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon the next day the following proceedings took place during the trial:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Counsel  for Defendant. I desire  to make a motion this morning, that it having been conclusively shown by the evidence of the  plaintiff that the original plaintiff, Salvador Brocal, has no  interest  whatever in this controversy,  I move that his, name be  eliminated from the complaint.   There is liable to  be  confusion about the matter.</p>
  <p>"The Court. There will be no confusion in the rendering of the judgment, as far as the proof is concerned.  I will reserve my decision on that until the final disposition of the case.</p>
  <p>"Counsel for Defendant.  Saving me an exception." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The court does not seem to have made any ruling upon this question, but in his final decision he ordered judgment against the defendant in  favor of Seldner.  The original plaintiff, Brocal, took no  exception to this judgment, and has not appealed.  The effect of the first order of the court was to add Seldner as a party plaintiff, so that  at the time judgment was rendered there were two plaintiffs in the case, Seldner and Brocal.  Judgment was rendered in favor  of one  only of these plaintiffs,  Seldner.  Brocal might have objected to  this  judgment, but he  did  not. The assignment of error, based upon the addition of Seldner as a plaintiff in the case, can  not be sustained.   Section 110 of the Code of Civil Procedure expressly provides that the court, at any stage of the proceedings, may amend any pleading  by adding  the name  of  any  party,  either plaintiff or defendant. That was all that was  done in this case.</p>
<p>The court below  ordered judgment  for the plaintiff, Seldner, for f619.47, and interest from  the date of the presentation of the complaint.  We do not think  that the plaintiff is entitled to recover more than $356.53, with interest as aforesaid.</p>
<p>The judgment of the court below is reversed, and after the expiration of twenty days the case should be remanded, with instructions to the court below  to enter judgment in favor of plaintiff, Seldner, and against the defendant, for the sum of $356.53, money of the United States,  with interest thereon at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from the 11th day of November, 1903, until the satisfaction thereof, and for the costs.   No costs will be allowed to either party in this court.  So ordered.</p>
