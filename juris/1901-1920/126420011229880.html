				<H3>DAMASA LAFORGA ET AL., PLAINTIFFS AND APPELLANTS, VS. BRUNO LAFORGA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>MAPA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is an  action for the recovery of possession of two parcels of land described in the complaint and situate, one in the <em>sitio</em> of Balayoac and the other  in  Lubec, of the pueblo of Badoc, Province of Ilocos Norte.</p>
<p>The defendant in his written answer admits  that these parcels of land belong to the plaintiffs but alleges that  he is in possession of them through their delivery  to him  by the plaintiff Damasa Laforga on a mortgageâ€”the first of the two parcels, that in Balayoac, as security for the sum of  P95 and the second, that in Lubec, for the sum of P200, and states  that he is willing to  return said parcels to the plaintiffs whenever they pay him said sums.</p>
<p>Upon the evidence adduced at the trial, the court ordered the defendant to deliver immediately to the plaintiffs the Balayoac land, and also P203, likewise to  deliver to them the Lubec land.   No special finding was made as to the costs.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs have appealed from the judgment only with respect to the obligation it imposes upon them to  pay to the defendant the sum of P203 as a condition precedent to his returning the Lubec land to them.</p>
<p>The grounds upon which  this part of the judgment appealed from rests are thus stated therein:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"From the evidence adduced it has been proved that the defendant has been paying money up to the sum of P203 to the attorney for the plaintiff for the  expenses of the suit which they have been maintaining, with the agreement that the said defendant should continue in  the usufruct of the Lubec land until he should be reimbursed for the aforementioned sum paid by him."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The record discloses that the agreement  referred to in the judgment was excuted  solely  and exclusively by the plaintiff, Damasa Laforga, the grandmother of the other plaintiffs, who are still minors, and that the land in question, that of Lubec, belongs exclusively to them.  Damasa Laforga was not the legal representative of the said minors at the time of the execution of that agreement and she evidently acted merely as their grandmother.  Even supposing that she might then have been acting as the guardian <i>ad litem</i> of  said minors, which is  the most that could be admitted from the  evidence adduced  at the trial,  such capacity  could  not authorize her  validly to execute  the agreement  concerned,  which,  therefore,  lacks  the  legal force requisite to make it binding upon  the  minors.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from is reversed, in so far as it declares that the plaintiff minors must pay the sum of P203 to the  defendant, and the latter is ordered  to deliver immediately to them the  disputed Lubec land, but the right is reserved to the defendant to prosecute his  claim for said payment against Damasa Laforga in the manner and form provided by  law.  No  special finding is made of the costs in this instance.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano,  C. J., Torres, Johnson, Carson, Moreland,</em> and <em>Trent, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
