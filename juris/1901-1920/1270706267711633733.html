				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">After the&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; appealed from&nbsp; had been&nbsp; rendered, the appellant herein moved for a new&nbsp; trial,&nbsp; and on&nbsp; his motion&nbsp; being overruled he excepted to&nbsp; the ruling and duly presented the proper bill of exceptions.&nbsp; He did&nbsp; not, however, base his motion for a new trial on&nbsp; the&nbsp; ground of the judgment being contrary to the weight of the evidence or upon&nbsp; its&nbsp; being insufficiently&nbsp; supported thereby; at least, neither the original&nbsp; bill&nbsp; of exceptions nor the printed copy thereof show any evidence of his having done so.&nbsp; In both documents it is stated that a&nbsp; new&nbsp; trial was asked for, but the ground on&nbsp; which his request was based was not stated. For this reason we&nbsp; can not review the evidence, according to the definite provisions of the law which expressly prohibit the review of questions of fact on appeal, in cases brought before this court by bill of exceptions, when the appealing party does not ask in first instance for a new&nbsp; trial on that ground,&nbsp; which is&nbsp; the formula adopted by the law for the expression of the appellant's disapproval of the trial judge's findings&nbsp; of fact.&nbsp; The appeal not&nbsp; having been&nbsp; prepared in the form expressly prescribed by law, it is understood that the right&nbsp; to a&nbsp; review of the evidence was waived by the appellant, and that only the questions of law raised by the bill of exceptions are submitted for the decision of this court.&nbsp; (Sec. 497,&nbsp; Code of&nbsp; Civil Procedure,&nbsp; amended&nbsp; by Act No. 1596.)<br><br>The question involved in the case at bar is the collection of medical fees amounting to P340, to the payment of which the estate represented by the appellant was sentenced in first instance.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the judgment appealed from it was found to be proven that the&nbsp; plaintiff was called to render medical attendance to Maria&nbsp; Pilar Lucero, the predecessor in interest of the said estate, whom he found dangerously ill; that he in fact attended her during several days, visited her two or three times,&nbsp; prescribed proper treatment and gave special care and&nbsp; attention to her case;&nbsp; that&nbsp; on the night of the patient's death the plaintiff was again called,&nbsp; as&nbsp; was also another physician with whom he held a&nbsp; consultation with regard to the patient's condition; and&nbsp; that both these&nbsp; physicians remained in the patient's house&nbsp; and attended&nbsp; her continuously until her death&nbsp; on&nbsp; the early morning of the following day.&nbsp; It is also stated in the judgment that several physicians testified at the&nbsp; trial that the&nbsp; bill of P340 presented by the plaintiff for his professional services aforementioned, was very reasonable.<br><br>Such being the&nbsp; facts, and&nbsp; we can&nbsp; not take account&nbsp; of others for the reason before indicated, we see no occasion for reversing the&nbsp; judgment of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance pronounced in favor&nbsp; of the plaintiff.<br><br>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.&nbsp; So&nbsp; ordered.<br><br><i> Arellano, C. J., Carson </i>and <i>Moreland, JJ.</i>, concur.<br></div>
