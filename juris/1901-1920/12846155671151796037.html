				<h4>
				G.R. No. 12690, September 27, 1917</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. LIM BIN (ALIAS) FERMIN V. C. BIO GUAN, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The only question presented by this appeal is whether the son of Chinese 
parents, who was born in the Philippine Islands in the year 1882, and who has 
lived continuously therein since 1898, can be deported, as a Chinese laborer, 
for having failed to register under the provisions of Act No. 702.
<p>The undisputed facts of the record show; that the appellant was born in the 
city of Manila in the month of July, 1882; that his father and mother were 
Chinese; that he, together with his parents, went to China when he was five or 
six years of age; that he returned to Manila in the year 1898; that he returned 
to Manila for the purpose of making the Philippine Islands his home; that he has 
continued to live in the city of Manila since his return; that having been born 
in the Philippine Islands he considered that he was a citizen thereof.</p>
<p>The Government presented no proof to contradict the foregoing facts; and the 
Attorney-General in this court renounced his right to present a brief. He 
renounced his right to present arguments in support of the contention of the 
Government.</p>
<p>When the appellant returned to the Philippine Islands in 1898, he was a minor 
and was still a minor on the 27th day of March, 1903, when Act No. 702 was 
adopted. Furthermore, he was yet a minor at the termination of the year within 
which Chinese aliens were required to register under the provisions of said Act. 
He had established his residence in the Philippine Islands on the 11th day of 
April, 1899, when, by virtue of the Treaty,of Paris, the Philippine archipelago 
became territory of the Government of the United States. He was less than 
seventeen years of age when the Treaty of Paris was concluded. At the 
termination of the period within which he was required to register under Act No. 
702 he was less than twenty-one years of age. Under the laws in force at that 
time he did not reach his majority until the month of July, 1905.</p>
<p>By virtue of the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution 
of the United States all persons born within the United States, if they so 
elect, are citizens thereof, except children born of parents in the diplomatic 
service. If, therefore, he had been born in the United States as above 
indicated, he would have been a citizen thereof. (U. S. <em>vs</em>. Wong Kim 
Ark, 169 U. S., 649, 676, 682, 693, and other cases therein cited.)</p>
<p>Having been born within the Philippine Islands, and having adopted the same 
as his home prior to the acquisition of said territory by the Government of the 
United States, we do not believe that it was the intention of Congress, or of 
the Legislature of the Philippine Islands, to require him, or any other person 
in his class and in his condition, to register under said Act No. 702, as an 
alien. While this conclusion may be in conflict with the political laws in force 
here under the Spanish sovereignty, we believe that it is in harmony with the 
spirit of the law of the United States. (Boyd <em>vs</em>. Thayer, 143 U. S., 
135, 157, 181; U. S. <em>vs</em>. Go-Siaco, 12 Phil. Rep., 490; Munoz 
<em>vs</em>. Collector of Customs, 20 Phil. Rep., 494; Roa <em>vs</em>. 
Collector of Customs, 23 Phil. Rep., 315; Vano Uy Tat Tong <em>vs</em>. 
Collector of Customs, 23 Phil. Rep., 480; U. S. <em>vs</em>. Ong Tianse, 29 
Phil. Rep., 332.)</p>
<p>Neither do we believe that it was the intention of the Legislature to require 
minors to register in accordance with the provisions of Act No. 702. (U. S. 
<em>vs.</em> Tan Chuy Ho, 31 Phil. Rep., 383.)</p>
<p>Having reached the conclusion that the appellant was not required, under the 
provisions of said Act No. 702, to register in order to remain in the Philippine 
Islands, he cannot be deported for his failure so to do.</p>
<p>Therefore, the judgment of the lower court is hereby revoked; the complaint 
presented against the defendant is hereby dismissed; and it is hereby ordered 
and decreed that he be set at liberty, and without any finding as to costs. So 
ordered.</p><em>Arellano, C. J., Araullo</em>, and <em>Street, JJ</em>., concur.

<p>CARSON, J., concurring:</p>I concur with the disposition of this case.

<p>MALCOLM, J., concurring:</p>
<p>I agree in substance with the decision of the court. I can, however, see how 
the facts permit of a different line of reasoning leading to the same 
conclusion. I prefer an unequivocal ruling as to the status of children born of 
Chinese parents in the Philippines.</p>
<p>I think these rules are clear—(1) If a child was born of Chinese parents in 
the Philippines prior to the extension of the Spanish Civil Code to the Islands, 
the citizenship of the child is determined by the laws then in force in the 
Philippines, naming especially the Royal Decree of November 17, 1852, the law of 
September 18, 1870, and Law 3, title 11, book 6 of the <em>Novisima 
Recopilacion</em>; (2) If a child was born of Chinese parents in the Philippines 
subsequent to the extension of the Spanish Civil Code to the Islands but prior 
to acquisition of the Philippines by the United States, the citizenship of the 
child is determined by the provisions of the Civil Code; (3) If a child was born 
of Chinese parents in the Philippines after acquisition of the Islands by the 
United States, the citizenship of the child is determined by the American law of 
citizenship, naming especially the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States 
Constitution and the leading construction of the United States Supreme Court in 
the case of U. S. <em>vs</em>. Wong Kim Ark ([1897], 169 U.S., 649.)</p>
<p>The facts of the present case fall under rule 1. The parents of Lim Bin under 
the Spanish law were considered as Spanish subjects. (Laws cited supra; 
decisions of the supreme court of Spain of November 14, 1859, and of August 
29,1861; Sy Joe Lieng <em>vs</em>. Sy Quia [1910], 16 Phil., 137, affirmed by 
the United States Supreme Court, 228 U. S., 335; ruling of the United States 
Department of State on the Jose Velasco Chua Chienco application for a passport, 
September 11, 1911.) The citizenship of the child followed that of his parents 
(father). (Citations <em>supra</em>.) The father, if then alive, appears not to 
have taken advantage of the provisions of the Treaty of Paris, so that both he 
and the child became citizens of the Philippine Islands. (<em>In re</em> Arnaiz 
[1906], 9 Phil., 705.) Chinese descent did not change Lin Bim's status. (Vaño 
<em>vs</em>. Collector of Customs [1912], 23 Phil, 480.) On attaining majority 
it is possible he could choose his citizenship, which he has done by claiming to 
be a citizen of the Philippine Islands. (Roa <em>vs.</em> Collector of Customs 
[1912], 23 Phil., 315.)</p>
<p>If a citizen of the Philippine Islands, obviously Lim Bin does not come 
within the purview of Act No. 702 relating to the registration of Chinese 
laborers and cannot therefore be deported from the Philippine Islands.</p>
<p>"The Chinese Exclusion Law can not be invoked for the purpose of keeping out 
of the Philippine Islands actual <em>bona fide</em> citizens of said Islands." 
(Vaño <em>vs</em>. Collector of Customs, <em>supra</em>.)</p></div>
