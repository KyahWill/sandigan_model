				<BR><STRONG>MAPA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> The defendant was on intimate terms with Marcosa Peñalosa,  18 years of age, while the latter lived at the house of her father, Gregorio Peñalosa, who is  the private prosecutor in this case and who was opposed to these relations. During the afternoon of May  2, 1901, Marcosa left her house of her own free will and went to that  of the defend ant for  the purpose of demanding from him  the fulfilment of the promise of marriage which he had repeatedly made her on  previous occasions.  Two witnesses were present in the defendant's house, dealing with him on business matters, when she presented herself there between 1 and 2 of that afternoon.  These witnesses were  informed that very afternoon that Marcosa would be married to the defendant and were asked by the latter to act as witnesses to the marriage which  was celebrated the following day, May 3, as appears  from the corresponding certificate which is a part of the record.&nbsp; <br><br>From these facts, which we consider sufficiently proved, it is seen that the departure of Marcosa Pefialosa from her house was, instead of a case of abduction, a real elopement carried  out by her as a means for contracting marriage with the defendant  against the opposition of her father, inasmuch as she acted upon her own initiative and was not seduced by the said  defendant.  But whether elopement or abduction, it is evident that the  act was not committed with unchaste designs but with matrimonial intentions which were, indeed, well known to certain persons from the  very commencement of  the affair,  and which were realized the following day by the marriage of the accused to the woman alleged to have been abducted.
<p>The unchaste designs constitute one of the essential elements that characterize the  crime  of abduction, as  well when  committed with  violence  against the will  of the woman as when carried out with her consent in case of her minority.  This is  precisely  the point which constitutes one  of the principal differences which distinguish  this crime from crimes against personal liberty and security. If the removal of a woman from her house, although she be a virgin under the age of 23 years, is  committed for the purpose of murdering her or demanding a ransom, or holding her a prisoner somewhere, it would undoubtedly constitute a  crime but would by no means fall under the provisions of the sections of the Penal Code which define and punish the crime of abduction, but of other  sections quite distinct, although there exists  in such case the material fact of the stealing away of a woman.   This consideration demonstrates  that the unchaste purpose is essential in all cases to the crime of abduction, and this  same conclusion is deduced from the fact that the crime is classified in the Code among the crimes against chastity.  Article 445 of the said Code establishes clearly and conclusively the necessity of said circumstance in order that the crime of abduction may exist, and even though section 446, invoked by the complainant as applying to the present case, in speaking of the abduction of a virgin under the age of 23 years and over 12, committed with her consent,  does not make express mention  of unchaste designs,  the  provisions of this article should be considered in connection  with  those of the  preceding one, which requires this circumstance as indispensable and essential.  Article 445 is the complement of article 446, the two forming, as they do, a part of one and the same chapter included in the title which the Code devotes  to crimes against chastity.</p>
<p>In addition to this, paragraph 2 of article 448, which treats of causes for abduction, speaks only of abduction committed with unchaste designs, and the preceding interpretation is still  further confirmed  by article 449 in that it provides  that those convicted of abduction  shall be sentenced, by way of indemnity, to endow the complainant and acknowledge the offspring.   This impliedly  presupposes the idea of unchaste purpose in  all cases  of abduction, for the provisions of this article as well as in  that of article 448 above-mentioned are applicable to all cases of abduction for the reason that  the Code expressly declares them to be of common application to all crimes against chastity.</p>
<p>In  view of the foregoing considerations  we  are of the opinion that the judgment appealed  from should  be affirmed with costs in this instance <em>de oficio</em>. It is so ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Cooper, </em>and <em>Willard., JJ.,</em> concur.</p><p><em>Ladd, J.,</em> did not sit in this case. </p>
