				<h4>
				G.R. No. 1464, February 11, 1904</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE, VS. MAXIMO OANGOANG ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MAPA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The evidence plainly shows that the defendants are guilty of the robbery of 
80 Mexican pesos of which they are charged, and that they committed the,crime by 
exercising violence upon the persons of Tita Porfirio and Dionisia Barut, whom 
they beat and kicked until the former showed them the place where the said money 
was kept, whereupon they took the same.
<p>This case falls within the provisions of paragraph 5 of article 503 of the 
Penal Code, as the crime was not committed under any of the circumstances 
indicated in the first four paragraphs of said article.</p>
<p>The aggravating circumstance of nocturnity must be considered against the 
defendants, but this circumstance is offset by the mitigating circumstance of 
drunkenness with respect to Julian Jimenez, for we consider it to have been 
proven that the latter was intoxicated at the time the crime was committed, and 
that intoxication was not habitual with him. For these reasons the penalty 
prescribed by the law should be imposed upon the said Jimenez in its medium 
degree, and upon the other defendant, Maximo Oangoang, in its maximum degree; as 
with respect to the latter there are no mitigating circumstances to be 
considered.</p>
<p>The motion filed on behalf of the defendant Oangoang for release on bail is 
denied.</p>
<p>We therefore affirm the judgment appealed, the penalty imposed upon Maximo 
Oangoang to be ten years of <em>presidio mayor</em> and that imposed upon Julian 
Jimenez to be six years, also <em>presidio mayor,</em> the defendants to pay the 
costs of this instance equally between them. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Cooper, Willard, McDonough,</em> and 
<em>Johnson, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
