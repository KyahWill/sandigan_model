				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The purpose of the complaint&nbsp; filed&nbsp; in this&nbsp; case is&nbsp; to recover possession of a&nbsp; parcel&nbsp; of land&nbsp; and&nbsp; to&nbsp; obtain&nbsp; the payment of damages for its unlawful occupation.&nbsp; The plaintiff alleged:&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;&nbsp; That he was the&nbsp; owner of&nbsp; certain urban property, consisting of a house and lot, in the district of Molo of the municipality of Iloilo, which was sufficiently described in the complaint;&nbsp; (2) that, adjoining his property on&nbsp; the north is the lot belonging to the defendants, and on which the latter erected, northeast of the plaintiff's&nbsp; house, a temporary <i>camarin </i>or warehouse with&nbsp; roof&nbsp; and&nbsp; sides of old burnt galvanized iron;&nbsp; (3) that this temporary&nbsp; warehouse&nbsp; occupied an area of about 90 square <i>varas </i>on the northeastern part of the land of the plaintiff, and that nothwithstanding the demands&nbsp; made by the latter upon the defendants to vacate the said land by removing the warehouse with which they had occupied it, they refused to&nbsp; do so and,&nbsp; instead, claimed title, ownership, and control over the disputed land, thereby&nbsp; causing the plaintiff damages&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; extent of P3,000.&nbsp; The complaint concluded by asking that judgment be rendered whereby, first,&nbsp; it be found that the plaintiff is the exclusive&nbsp; owner of the portion of land, of&nbsp; 90 square <i>varas</i>,&nbsp; occupied by the temporary warehouse of the defendants, as&nbsp; an integral part of the land described and which belongs to the plaintiff;&nbsp; second, that the defendants be compelled&nbsp; to remove and place elsewhere the said warehouse constructed on the said northeastern portion of the plaintiff's land; and, third, damages in the amount mentioned in&nbsp; the complaint, and the costs.<br><br>The&nbsp; defendants denied all the facts alleged&nbsp; in the complaint, and, in a cross complaint,&nbsp; asked for a&nbsp; partition of the lot claimed by the plaintiff to be his own, alleging that they were entitled to an equal share therein, for the reason that the said property belonged to an&nbsp; estate, as&nbsp; yet&nbsp; undivided, in which they&nbsp; were interested.&nbsp; The&nbsp; plaintiff, in turn, denied the facts set forth in this cross complaint.<br><br>The case having come to trial, the Court of First Instance of Iloilo&nbsp; rendered a judgment, in&nbsp; which he found&nbsp; the&nbsp; following:<br><blockquote>"1.&nbsp; That the original&nbsp; owner and possessor of the land in question, as established by the evidence, was the Chinaman, Liboro Ramiro (<i>alias </i>Bonga), whose heirs succeeded him in his ownership and possession and subsequently transferred their rights, ownership and interest in the aforesaid land to the&nbsp; herein&nbsp; plaintiff, who has, continuously and&nbsp; without interruption, maintained his possession as owner;<br><br>"2.&nbsp; That the&nbsp; plaintiff and&nbsp; his&nbsp; predecessors in&nbsp; interest have possessed and occupied the land in question, as owners, in good faith, openly, notoriously, and publicly for a period of more than thirty years prior to&nbsp; the initiation of this suit;<br><br>"3. That&nbsp; about&nbsp; eight or nine years ago,&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants constructed on the plaintiff's land a camarin or warehouse made of old galvanized iron and other second-hand material, as&nbsp; shown in&nbsp; the&nbsp; photograph, Exhibit C,&nbsp; as No. 2, and erected on that part of the plaintiff's land that is indicated in the rough sketch, Exhibit B, as No. 3;<br><br>"4. That&nbsp; the true boundary line of the northern part of the plaintiff's land is that given as&nbsp; "4&nbsp; to 6"&nbsp; in the rough sketch,&nbsp; Exhibit B, and within which boundary is&nbsp; included the aforementioned warehouse constructed&nbsp; by the&nbsp; defendants;<br><br>"5. That&nbsp; the said&nbsp; defendants refused to remove the said warehouse from the place before cited, after a demand had been made&nbsp; upon them so to do, and, instead, alleged that they owned&nbsp; the land on which it is built;<br><br>"6. That,&nbsp; owing to the form of&nbsp; construction of&nbsp; the roof of the said&nbsp; warehouse, the water shed by&nbsp; this roof&nbsp; falls against the&nbsp; wall of the&nbsp; plaintiff's house&nbsp; and has thereby caused him&nbsp; damage to the extent of P100;<br><br>"7. That the just and reasonable rental for the plaintiff's parcel of land, illegally occupied by the defendants during eight years,&nbsp; is two pesos for each month, or, for the period of eight years, P192.<br><br>"Therefore, this court&nbsp; is of the opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to&nbsp; a&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; against the defendants for the recovery of the&nbsp; ownership and possession&nbsp; of the land in question as&nbsp; described&nbsp; in the complaint and shown in the plan; Exhibit B,&nbsp; and for damages in the sum of P292, with the costs, moreover, against the defendants."<br></blockquote>From this judgment, rendered on&nbsp; August&nbsp; 3, 1909, the defendants appealed&nbsp; and&nbsp; also moved for a new trial, which motion was&nbsp; denied by the&nbsp; court and the record&nbsp; does&nbsp; not show that the defendants took any exception to such ruling.<br><br>The latter filed a bill of exceptions with this court wherein they made five assignments of error; but in&nbsp; view of&nbsp; the provisions of the law, it does not lay within the power of this court in&nbsp; the present case, to review the evidence,&nbsp; the conclusion upon&nbsp; which, by the lower court, is argued in the specification of the errors alleged against the judgment appealed from.<br><br>Pursuant to section&nbsp; 497,&nbsp; paragraph 3, of the&nbsp; Code of Civil Procedure now&nbsp; in force, if the excepting party files a motion in the Court of First Instance for a new trial upon the ground that the findings of fact are plainly and manifestly against the weight of evidence, and the&nbsp; judge&nbsp; overrules the&nbsp; motion, and&nbsp; due exception&nbsp; is taken, the Supreme Court may review the&nbsp; evidence, make such findings&nbsp; upon the facts and render&nbsp; such&nbsp; final judgment as&nbsp; justice and equity may require.&nbsp; The appellant not having taken exception to the denial of his motion for a new trial, this&nbsp; court ought not to review the evidence adduced in first&nbsp; instance nor could it&nbsp; do so in the present case, though it&nbsp; required review, owing to the failure to bring up the&nbsp; evidence pursuant to the provision of law above quoted, and&nbsp; must accept the findings of fact established by the trial court and only examine the&nbsp; direct application of the findings of law,&nbsp; on which the judgment rests, to the facts that&nbsp; were proved. This examination having been made, it is our opinion that the judgment accords with the facts found by&nbsp; the learned Court of First Instance to have been proved, and&nbsp; that the conclusions based thereon are in agreement with the provisions of law governing the matter at&nbsp; issue.<br><br>We therefore affirm&nbsp; that&nbsp; judgment, with the&nbsp; costs&nbsp; of this&nbsp; instance against the appellant.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i> Torres, Johnson, Moreland,</i> and <i>Trent, JJ.</i>, concur.<br></div>
