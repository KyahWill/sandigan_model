				<BR><STRONG>MORELAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is&nbsp; an appeal in an action&nbsp; brought to recover the possession, or, in default thereof, the value of certain jewels pawned&nbsp; to&nbsp; the defendants, who constitute&nbsp; the association known as "The U. S. Loan Co.," a pawnbroking establishment.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is claimed&nbsp; by the plaintiff&nbsp; that the jewels in question belonged to her and&nbsp; that&nbsp; they were&nbsp; pawned by her&nbsp; husband to the defendants without her knowledge and consent&nbsp; and during her absence&nbsp; from&nbsp; the country;&nbsp; that the&nbsp; defendants,&nbsp; at the&nbsp; time that the jewels were pawned, knew that they belonged to the plaintiff and that her&nbsp; husband had no right or authority from her to pawn them.<br><br>The learned&nbsp; trial court&nbsp; found in favor of plaintiff and entered&nbsp; judgment against&nbsp; the defendants&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; return of the jewels, or, in default of their return, that they pay to the plaintiff the sum of P2,800, the value thereof.&nbsp; From this&nbsp; judgment the defendants appealed, raising here both questions of law and of fact.<br><br>We have given very careful&nbsp; consideration to the facts presented by the record on this appeal.&nbsp; While the evidence is somewhat conflicting, we are,&nbsp; nevertheless, clearly of the&nbsp; opinion that the following&nbsp; findings of fact made by the&nbsp; learned trial court are supported by a great preponderance of the&nbsp; evidence:<br><br>First.&nbsp; That the jewels in question belonged to the plaintiff and&nbsp; that that fact was known to the defendants at the time they received the same&nbsp; from her husband. <br></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">Second. That the&nbsp; pledge&nbsp; in pawn of said jewels by the husband of the&nbsp; plaintiff was without her knowledge&nbsp; and consent,&nbsp; and that by no conduct of hers was that act subsequently ratified.<br><br>The defendants, in this court, for the purpose of avoiding liability, assert&nbsp; that the plaintiff&nbsp; and her&nbsp; husband constituted a company known as C. W. Mead &amp; Co., a contracting firm, and that the jewels in question were pawned to the defendants by&nbsp; the plaintiff's husband for&nbsp; the&nbsp; purpose of raising funds to conduct the business of&nbsp; that company; that said funds went into and formed a part of the assets of that company and&nbsp; that the&nbsp; plaintiff thereby received the benefits of such pawn; that this being so,&nbsp; she ought not now to be heard to impugn the pawn or to escape the results of the act of the managing member of the company.<br><br>In reply to this, it is&nbsp; sufficient to say that&nbsp; the jewels were pawned personally by the plaintiff's husband; that the plaintiff knew nothing of such pawn and never consented thereto; that she knew nothing&nbsp; of the purpose to which&nbsp; such funds were&nbsp; destined and knew nothing whatever of that transaction or of&nbsp; any detail thereof until she had returned to this country from abroad several months after it had been consummated; that she never ratified that act,&nbsp; but always disavowed any&nbsp; part&nbsp; in it; that such assertion&nbsp; of the&nbsp; defendants is in opposition&nbsp; to the allegation of their answer, in which&nbsp; they&nbsp; say that&nbsp; the&nbsp; proceeds&nbsp; of the&nbsp; pawn were dedicated to the ordinary uses of the family as such.&nbsp; But, under any view, no person may be deprived&nbsp; of his property without his knowledge&nbsp; or consent upon the assertion that the proceeds&nbsp; of such property or&nbsp; a portion thereof have gone&nbsp; to the. beneficial use of a company of which he may have&nbsp; been a member.<br><br>Upon the whole, we are fully convinced that the case was correctly decided by the learned trial court.&nbsp; After a careful&nbsp; consideration of&nbsp; the&nbsp; arguments&nbsp; presented in&nbsp; the very&nbsp; able briefs of counsel and a thorough study of&nbsp; the record,&nbsp; we are clearly&nbsp; of the opinion that the judgment ought to be affirmed.<br><br>The judgment appealed from is, therefore, affirmed, with costs&nbsp; against&nbsp; the appellants.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J., Mapa, Carson, </i>and <i>Trent,&nbsp; JJ.</i>, concur.<br></div>
