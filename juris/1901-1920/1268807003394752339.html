				<BR><STRONG>TRENT, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a motion to dismiss an appeal on the ground that the appellant has 
not complied with the rules of this court in the preparation of his brief. Rules 
19 and 20 read as follows:
<blockquote>
<p>"19. Prefixed to the brief of the appellant, but stated separately, shall be 
an assignment of errors intended to be urged. Each specification of error shall 
be separately, distinctly, and concisely stated without repetition, and they 
shall be numbered consecutively. All briefs shall be printed and shall exhibit 
an extract of the argument on the points of law or fact to be discussed, with 
reference to the pages of the record and the authorities relied upon in support 
of each point. The brief of the appellant shall also contain a concise statement 
of the facts in the case.</p>
<p>"20. No error not affecting the jurisdiction over the subject matter will be 
considered unless stated in the assignment of errors and relied upon in the 
brief.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The appeal is from a judgment dismissing the complaint with costs after 
sustaining a demurrer to the complaint on the ground that it does not state a 
cause of action. Under the usual heading, the brief starts off with the 
following paragraphs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This is an appeal in the above-entitled cause against an order handed down 
on January 24, 1914, dismissing the complaint, and excepted to by the 
appellant.</p>
<p>"In the opinion of the appellant, the complaint sets forth facts of 
sufficient weight to constitute a cause of action, and the demurrer interposed 
against the same ought to be overruled, notwithstanding the opinion of the 
Honorable (judge) Crossfield, who holding the personal action of the appellant 
to be a real action, arrived at the conclusion that article 335 of the Code of 
Civil Procedure must be applied in this case. This, in our opinion, is an error 
which greatly prejudices the interest of the plaintiff, * * *."</p></blockquote>
<p>The brief then continues to discuss the facts alleged in the complaint and 
their sufficiency in law to constitute a right of action. It is urged that this 
is not a compliance with the above-quoted rules nor with our decision in Paterno 
<em>vs.</em> City of Manila (17 Phil. Rep., 26), to which we also add Santiago 
<em>vs.</em> Felix (24 Phil. Rep., 378).</p>
<p>In the first case, "counsel for appellant in his printed brief makes no 
specific assignment of errors, but argues in a general way two questions." In 
the second case, the single error assigned was, "The Court of First Instance of 
this city incurred error in rendering the judgment appealed from, for it is 
contrary to law and the weight of the evidence." </p>
<p>It is apparent that the case at bar is to be distinguished from the first 
case, because there is in the opening statement of the appellant a reasonable 
specific assignment of error, to wit, that the court erred in holding that the 
complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. While 
not being set off by itself and labeled as an assignment of error, this 
statement makes the point as effectually if not as artistically. Such a 
statement requires an inspection of the complaint and of the complaint alone for 
its determination. To set off the error assigned with an appropriate title would 
tend to clearness of style and hence be more acceptable to the court, but it 
would not avoid the necessity of examining the contents of the complaint.</p>
<p>The present case may also be readily distinguished from the second case 
cited. There are so many ways in which a judgment may be contrary to law and the 
weight of the evidence that such a general statement leaves the court absolutely 
in the dark as to what to look for. An alleged error should have definite bounds 
and be limited as far as possible to a single point. Nothing could be more 
irreducible than the statement that the complaint does not state facts 
sufficient to constitute a cause of action, without limiting the extent of the 
inquiry. For such a statement requires an inspection of the complaint as a 
whole, and nothing less will suffice to dispose of it. It requires an 
examination of only one particular portion of the record, to wit, the initial 
pleading—the complaint.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in the two cases cited, the cases had gone to judgment on 
the merits and a mere general discussion of what had transpired or the statement 
that the judgment was contrary to law left the court to struggle through the 
briefs and records in an effort to pick out something wrong.</p>
<p>Although the brief of the appellant is not a literal compliance with the 
rules of the court, nor is it a work of art from a professional point of view, 
still, we do not believe the departure from the prescribed practice has been so 
radical as to call for a dismissal of the case. We do not desire, however, to be 
understood as holding that it is not absolutely necessary to comply 
substantially with the above-quoted rules.</p>
<p>The motion is therefore denied.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Carson,</em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.,</em> 
concur.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>CONCURRING</strong></p>
<p><strong>MORELAND, J.</strong></p>
<p>I agree to the decision. There are some expressions used therein, however, 
which may be misleading in view of other decisions of this court, and it is to 
that situation that I desire to call attention.</p>
<p>The court, in comparing an assignment of error providing that "the Court of 
First Instance of this city erred in rendering the judgment appealed from, for 
it is contrary to law and the weight of the evidence" with a demurrer to a 
complaint upon the ground "that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to 
constitute a cause of action," makes the observation that "nothing could be more 
irreducible than a statement that the complaint does not state facts sufficient 
to constitute a cause of action, without limiting the extent of, the inquiry." 
The purpose of the court in making this comparison is to demonstrate that the 
allegation that a judgment is contrary to law and the weight of the evidence is 
a reducible statement, that is, a statement so general that it means nothing and 
points put no error of which the appellate court can take notice; whereas the 
statement that a complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause 
of action is a statement so specific and direct and points out so clearly the 
error in the complaint as to be entirely irreducible; that is, by no language 
could, the error in the complaint be more specifically pointed out or attention 
more directly and definitely called thereto.</p>
<p>I take exception to the statement with. regard to the irreducibility of the 
allegation that a complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a 
cause of action and support my contention in the decision of this court in the 
case of Lizarraga Hermanos <em>vs.</em> Yap Tico (24 Phil. Rep., 504).</p>
<p>In that case one of the questions presented to and resolved by the court 
arose upon the sufficiency of a demurrer which simply alleged that the complaint 
did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action; and, far from 
holding that said statement was an irreducible statement and was so definite and 
certain, and so direct in calling the attention of the court to the error 
charged, that it could not be improved on in that regard, this court held 
precisely the contrary, namely, that a demurrer containing such a statement was 
so general and indefinite and failed so completely to comply with the express 
provisions of section 91 of the Code of Civil Procedure, that it was a defective 
demurrer <em>for that reason</em> and, if objected to upon that ground, could 
not be held to have raised any question as to the sufficiency of the complaint. 
The court laid down the doctrine in that case that, when a defendant demurred to 
a complaint upon the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute 
a cause of action, he must point out the precise objection to which he alluded 
and state specifically wherein the complaint failed to state a cause of 
action.</p>
<p>In discussing that question we said: "A demurrer * * * should not leave the 
court and the party against whose pleading it is aimed as ignorant of the defect 
in the offending pleading as before the demurrer is filed. Many times the 
objection that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a 
cause of action means very little. There are occasions, of course, when it is 
sufficient. But it is certain that no injury can ever result from naming the 
<em>precise reason</em> why the complaint does not state facts sufficient to 
constitute a cause of action; and, in the great majority of cases, great good 
will come of it."</p>
<p>And further on in the decision the court also said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When a demurrer is made to a complaint, whether upon one ground or another, 
it should set out distinctly the grounds upon which the objection is based. It 
cannot be couched simply in the language of the code. It must set-forth 
distinctly the grounds upon which that language is founded. The reason for. this 
is plain. It is not fair to the plaintiff to interpose to a complaint the simple 
objection that it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of 
action. Neither is it fair to the court. Neither the plaintiff nor the court 
should be left to make, possibly, a long and tiresome examination and 
investigation and then, perhaps, finally be compelled to guess. The grounds of 
the objection should be pointed out so that all may see. A demurrer was not 
invented to make useless work for a court, or to deceive or delude a plaintiff. 
Its purpose was to clarify all ambiguities; to make certain all indefinite 
assertions ; to bring the plaintiff to a clear and clean expression of the 
precise grievance which he has against the defendant; to aid in arriving at a 
real issue between the parties; to promote understanding and prevent surprise. 
To that end, a demurrer should specify, for the benefit of the plaintiff and the 
court as well, the very weakness which the demurrant believes he sees in the 
complaint. It should be so presented and handled as to bring to a quick 
determination the question whether the plaintiff has, at bottom, a legal claim 
against the defendant. To attain this object, the demurrer should be clear, 
specific, definite, and certain as to the precise weakness of the complaint. 
Being an instrument to cure imperfections, it should not itself be 
imperfect.</p>
<p>"To the complaint before us a demurrer was interposed, stating merely that 
the complaint did not allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. 
No particular ground was specified. No specific failure was asserted or named. 
No precise weakness was pointed out. The order overruling the demurrer does not 
indicate that the court was informed as to the specific grounds upon which it 
was based. Certainly, so far as the record goes, the plaintiffs never knew until 
after the demurrer was decided precisely what the defendant was driving at when 
he presented it."</p></blockquote>
<p>The court says that the statement that a complaint does not state facts 
sufficient to constitute a cause of action is so definite, direct and clear that 
it cannot be made more so "without limiting the extent of 'the inquiry." The 
"extent of the inquiry" in such a case is to determine whether the complaint 
states a cause of action or not; and it in no wise limits the extent of the 
inquiry for the demurrant to point out where and in what particular the 
complaint fails to state a cause of action. Precisely the same inquiry exists in 
one case as in the other. The inquiry always is: Does the complaint state facts 
sufficient to constitute a cause of action ? And that inquiry is not limited by 
requiring the demurrant to point out the particular ground upon which he makes 
the allegation.</p>
<p>The statement quoted is not necessary to a decision of the case at bar, and I 
would not refer to it except that it might cause confusion in the mind of the 
bench or the bar in such a way as to weaken the doctrine laid down in the case 
above cited. With modification in this respect, I would not hesitate to concur 
fully in the decision as written.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>DISSENTING</strong></p>
<p><strong>JOHNSON, J.</strong></p>
<p>From an examination of the record, I fail to find any sound reason for not 
requiring the appellant to comply, with Rules 19 and 20 of this court, as we 
have done in other cases. (Paterno<em> vs. </em>City of Manila, 17 Phil. Rep., 
26; Santiago <em>vs.</em> Felix, 24 Phil. Rep., 378.) </p>
<p>In the case of Paterno<em> vs.</em> City of Manila (<em>supra</em>), this 
court said: "The rules of this court are few and simple. They have been 
promulgated for several years, and every practicing attorney should be familiar 
with them. They are the laws of the court and <em>must</em> be obeyed until 
repealed, unless it can be shown that they are in conflict with the laws of the 
United States or the Philippine Islands."</p>
<p>In the case of Santiago <em>vs.</em> Felix (<em>supra</em>), this court said: 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is an established rule of this court, <em>uniformly applied in many 
cases,</em> that if the appellant fails to make an assignment of errors and 
merely confines himself to a discussion of facts in general, this court can not 
disturb the adverse finding of the trial court alleged to be contrary to law and 
the weight of the evidence; it is necessary that the appellant point out 
specifically the alleged error or errors in the judgment appealed 
from."</p></blockquote>
<p>As was said in the case of Paterno<em> vs.</em> City of Manila:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The rules of this court are few and simple. They have been promulgated for 
several years and every practicing attorney should be familiar with them." Said 
Rule 19 requires an assignment of errors by the appellant; it requires that 
there shall be prefixed to the brief of the appellant an assignment of errors 
intended to be urged; that each assignment of error shall be separately, 
distinctly and concisely stated, without repetition. Said rule or requirement 
follows practically the rule of the Supreme Court of the United States. The 
purpose of the rule, as has been repeatedly stated by the Supreme Court of the 
United States, is to enable a busy court and the opposing counsel to see on what 
points opposing counsel intend to ask a reversal of the judgment, and for the 
further, and perhaps just as important a reason, to limit the discussion of the 
parties on the appeal to particular points, either of fact or of law. (Philipps 
<em>vs.</em> Seymour, 91 U. S., 646.) See also the following cases in which the 
Supreme Court of the United States dismissed the appeals for the reason that the 
appellants failed to make an assignment of error, in accordance with the rules; 
Treat <em>vs.</em> Jemison (20 Wall., 652); Maxwell <em>vs.</em> Stewart (21 
Wall., 71); Gumbel <em>vs. </em>Pitkin (113 U. S., 545); Dugger <em>vs.</em> 
Tayloe (121 U. S., 286); Benites <em>vs.</em> Hampton (123 IL S., 519); Rowe 
<em>vs</em>. Phelps (152 U. S., 87).</p></blockquote>
<p>I suppose that in each argument by each appellant there might be found, upon 
reading it, the particular error of which he complains. Courts, however, should 
not be required to read the arguments of appellants for the purpose of sifting 
out the particular error upon which they rely, especially when there have been 
established a "few and simple" rules for the purpose of facilitating the work of 
the courts, as well as of counsel.</p>
<p>I see no reason why the motion of the appellee in the present case should not 
have been granted, at least to the extent of requiring the appellant to make a 
special assignment or assignments of error upon which he expected to ask the 
court to reverse the judgment appealed from.</p>
