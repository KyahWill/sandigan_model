				<BR><STRONG>MORELAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila dismissing the plaintiffs' complaint upon the merits after trial with costs.<br><br>The action is founded upon a written agreement between the plaintiffs&nbsp; and the defendant,&nbsp; Matson, Lord&nbsp; &amp; Belser Company, for the construction of&nbsp; a reservoir constituting a part of the water system of the city&nbsp; of Manila.&nbsp; The plaintiff, the Manila Construction Company, is a subcontractor, the original contract for the construction of said reservoir having&nbsp; been made between the&nbsp; Matson, Lord &amp; Belser Company and the city of Manila.&nbsp; Upon application to the court soon after the action was&nbsp; commenced,&nbsp; the city of Manila was made a party defendant&nbsp; and is, in reality, the only defendant in the case which is&nbsp; defending.&nbsp; The contract&nbsp; between the Manila&nbsp; Construction Company and the Matson, Lord &amp; Belser Company was&nbsp; exactly the same in its terms as the contract between the&nbsp; Matson, Lord &amp; Belser Company and the&nbsp; city of Manila&nbsp; except as to&nbsp; the prices to be paid for the various&nbsp; classes&nbsp; of work.&nbsp; As a necessary result,&nbsp; if&nbsp; the Matson, Lord &amp;&nbsp; Belser&nbsp; Company is liable&nbsp; to the plaintiffs upon the contract between&nbsp; them, then the city&nbsp; of&nbsp; Manila is liable&nbsp; to the&nbsp; Matson, Lord &amp; Belser Company upon the contract&nbsp; between them,&nbsp; the question before us being simply a construction of the terms of the contract.<br><br>The matter in controversy relates solely to the building of the reservoir.&nbsp; Paragraph 14 of division E&nbsp; of&nbsp; said contract&nbsp; provides:<br><blockquote>"The entire inner&nbsp; surface of the reservoir shall then be lined&nbsp; in&nbsp; the following manner: Over all surfaces in solid rock without defects a plaster coat shall be applied of&nbsp; the same&nbsp; consistency and by the same&nbsp; methods as specified&nbsp; for unlined sections of the tunnel.&nbsp;&nbsp; On all surfaces of embankments, defective rock, or elsewhere where ordered by&nbsp; the engineer a layer of concrete 4 inches in thickness shall be placed, and this layer shall be finished with a top skim coat conforming in all respects to the skim coat specified for lined sections of the tunnel.&nbsp; All linings shall be kept wet and&nbsp; protected from the sun until entirely set and to the satisfaction of the engineer,"<br></blockquote>The references contained in the foregoing paragraph to lined and unlined sections of the tunnel refer to paragraphs 17 and 18 under division D of said contract, which read as follows:<br><blockquote>"17. All interior surfaces of unlined tunnel sections shall be given&nbsp; a plaster coat of cement mortar composed of 1 part cement and 1 part sand upon the&nbsp; scored surfaces heretofore described.&nbsp; This plaster coat shall be as thin as possible, flowed and troweled to a smooth and true surface, and shall in surface and appearance be equal to a plaster's finish coat.<br><br>"18. All lined sections or&nbsp; portions of sections and&nbsp; all chambers shall, immediately after forms are removed and pointing&nbsp; done, have a skim coat of cement mortar, consisting of 1&nbsp; part cement and&nbsp; 1 part&nbsp; sand, applied by a&nbsp; skillful plasterer in a workmanlike manner.&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp; skim coat shall in surface and&nbsp; appearance be equal to a&nbsp; plaster's finish coat."<br></blockquote>The plaintiff&nbsp; alleges that it has placed&nbsp; upon the inner surface of the reservoir a plaster&nbsp; coat to the extent of about 43,000 square yards, for 41,592 of which it has not received pay.&nbsp; Under&nbsp; the contract&nbsp; between&nbsp; the&nbsp; Matson, Lord &amp; Belser Company and the city of Manila the contractor was to be paid 55 cents gold for each square yard of plaster coat placed on the inside&nbsp; of the reservoir.&nbsp; In&nbsp; its subcontract with&nbsp; the plaintiff the Matson,&nbsp; Lord&nbsp; &amp; Belser Company agreed to pay to the plaintiff the sum of 44 cents gold for each&nbsp; square&nbsp; yard of plaster coat placed on the&nbsp; inside of said reservoir.&nbsp; The city asserts&nbsp; that it is not&nbsp; liable to the Matson,&nbsp; Lord &amp; Belser Company and, therefore, the latter is not liable to the plaintiff, for the placing of&nbsp; said 41,592 square yards of alleged plaster&nbsp; coat for&nbsp; the&nbsp; reason that said 41,592 square yards is not plaster coat but skim coat, the city maintaining that there is a vital distinction between the two.&nbsp; The&nbsp; city contends that under the terms of the contract it is not liable to pay anything whatever for the so-called skim coat, as&nbsp; it is a part of the concrete&nbsp; lining and other&nbsp; work for which the contract specifies&nbsp; plaintiff shall be paid $9.18 per cubic yard, claiming that the plaintiff, in order to complete the work under the terms of the contract, was obliged to place upon the outside surface of the concrete lining of the reservoir the skim coat mentioned in the contract, and that the payment&nbsp; for said skim coat was included in the $9.18 per cubic yard paid&nbsp; by&nbsp; the city to the plaintiff for the concrete work in&nbsp; said reservoir.<br><br>The contention of&nbsp; the parties in&nbsp; this&nbsp; action is clearly presented by the letters passing between the various companies interested and the chief engineer of sewer and waterworks construction on behalf of the city prior to the termination of the work and the commencement of the action. They follow: "<br><blockquote><center>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "EXHIBIT A.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></center><div style="text-align: right;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "MANILA, P.

contract.'<br><br>"Section 1 of the contract between this company and the subcontractor is as follows:<br><br>"'The subcontractor&nbsp; hereby agrees to provide&nbsp; all the necessary machinery, including all suitable cars and necessary tracks, tools, apparatus,&nbsp; and other means of construction, which shall be efficient, appropriate, and large&nbsp; enough to effect a satisfactory quality of&nbsp; work,&nbsp; and at a rate of progress sufficient to complete the work within the&nbsp;

The failure of&nbsp; the engineer or contractor to give such order shall not relieve&nbsp; the&nbsp; subcontractor of his&nbsp; obligation to insure the quality and quantity of work herein&nbsp; provided.'<br><br>"Section 14 of the&nbsp; contract between&nbsp; this company and&nbsp; the subcontractor is as follows:<br><br>"'The estimate of the <i>amount </i>of work done each month shall be made by the engineer as provided in section 20 on&nbsp;

and decision shall be precedent to the&nbsp; right of the subcontractor to receive any money hereunder.'<br><br>"Under date of October 12, 1908, the subcontractor, through its attorney, demanded&nbsp; pay for&nbsp; '41,592 square yards of plaster coating on the inner surface&nbsp; of the reservoir.'&nbsp; Pursuant&nbsp; to&nbsp; your letter of October 29 you claim that only 1,224.5 square yards of plaster coat was placed at the reservoir.&nbsp; You will see there is a great discrepancy between the claim of the Manila Construction&nbsp; Co. and your statement under date of October 29, 1908, as to the amount of plaster&nbsp; coat placed&nbsp; in the reservoir.&nbsp;&nbsp; We understand that the Manila Construction Co. claims that this difference arises in this way:<br><br>"The subcontractor claims that the entire inner surface of the&nbsp; reservoir has been covered with&nbsp; a&nbsp; plaster coat, and that this surface amounts to more than 41,000 square yards. The subcontractor claims, as we understand, that the price stipulated for the concrete lining mentioned in section&nbsp; 17, page 63, of the city's contract, does not include the plaster coat thereon.&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, that the concrete lining is complete in itself without the plaster coat, and that the engineer is in error in not making an estimate of the amount of plaster coat placed on the&nbsp; concrete lining and inner surface of the core wall.&nbsp; This matter is now&nbsp; of&nbsp; vital importance, inasmuch as&nbsp; suit has actually&nbsp; been commenced against this company by the subcontractor for payment for that plaster coat.<br><br>"We therefore request that you again make an&nbsp; estimate of the&nbsp; amount of plaster&nbsp; coat placed on the inner surface of the reservoir and submit the same to the Municipal Board for payment, and that you state your reasons for a refusal so to do. if such be your final decision.<br><br>"Respectfully yours,<br><br><div style="text-align: right;">&nbsp;&nbsp; "MATSON, LORD &amp; BELSER COMPANY,<br>By "____ _____<br></div><center><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "EXHIBIT J.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </center><br><div style="text-align: right;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "NOVEMBER 15, 1908.<br></div><br>"MATSON, LORD &amp; BELSER COMPANY, <i>Manila, P.

Our affirmance is based on the following grounds:<br><ol type="1"><li>There is, by the&nbsp; terms of the contract itself, a vital difference between&nbsp; "plaster coat" and "skim coat."</li></ol>In the first place, there is no provision in the contract anywhere relative&nbsp; to&nbsp; payment for services rendered and materials furnished in putting on skim coats; independent of other work.&nbsp; In other&nbsp; words, under the terms&nbsp; of the contract, "skim coat" has&nbsp; no separate, independent existence as a thing apart.&nbsp; It is regarded as&nbsp; something in connection with&nbsp; other&nbsp; things&nbsp; and other&nbsp; services.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, "plaster coat" has its own individual existence, its own independent functions, and forms no integral part of any other work.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; given a separate&nbsp; paragraph in the contract and a value is therein&nbsp; set for the&nbsp; services rendered and materials furnished in putting it on, namely, 55 cents gold per square yard.&nbsp; From this point of view, nothing could be recovered, under the terms of the contract, for placing the skim coat alone.&nbsp; Its&nbsp; existence has no set financial value.<br><br>In the second place, while the plaster coat&nbsp; and the skim coat perform some functions which are identical, they perform others quite different.&nbsp; Both fulfill&nbsp; the office of making a smooth surface for the free passage of&nbsp; the water, of preventing&nbsp; the adherence of&nbsp; foreign substances, and&nbsp; of rendering easier the cleansing of the reservoir.&nbsp; It is true also that their composition is the same.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each is composed of&nbsp; 1 part cement and 1 part&nbsp; sand.&nbsp; But the point which is important is that the functions which are&nbsp; vital to each are the very functions&nbsp; which show the difference between them.&nbsp; Under&nbsp; the terms&nbsp; of&nbsp; the contract plaster coat was to be placed on those portions of the reservoir upon which, aside from the mere excavation, no work of any kind had theretofore been done, that is to say, on solid rock free from defects; while the skim coat was to be placed only on concrete surfaces.&nbsp; The difference between&nbsp; them consists&nbsp; in the different ends they were to subserve as indicated by the different surfaces on which they were to be put.&nbsp; A plaster coat placed&nbsp; on a surface of solid rock torn apart by the forces&nbsp; making the&nbsp; excavation&nbsp; would evidently perform a service different from and additional to that of a skim coat placed on the level, even and comparatively smooth surface of concrete adjusted to forms.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is thus seen that, apart from the difference in&nbsp; meaning signified by the technical definition of the two terms, plaster coat and skim coat, there is a real difference in their use and the results obtained thereby.&nbsp; Such difference&nbsp; is&nbsp; emphasized by&nbsp; those&nbsp; provisions of the contract relative to the construction of the tunnel, which,&nbsp; at a reading, disclose the different ends to which the two&nbsp; substances were destined by the contracting parties.&nbsp; We conclude, then, that plaster coat&nbsp; and&nbsp; skim coat are not the same thing&nbsp; under the contract we are construing.<br><ol start="2"><li>The skim&nbsp; coat is an integral part of the finished concrete lining and payment for the latter includes payment for the former.<br></li></ol>That this is so we regard as having been clearly demonstrated by the proofs in the case.&nbsp; The&nbsp; arguments already adduced to show the difference between the plaster coat and the skim coat are equally effective in proving our present assertion, speaking from the&nbsp; standpoint of the contract itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the&nbsp; skim coat has no independent or separate existence of its own, then it must be an integral part of some other structure mentioned&nbsp; in the&nbsp; contract by which it is completely swallowed up.&nbsp; If it has no separate and independent value given to it as work performed and materials furnished, then&nbsp; its value must be included in that of some part or structure to which it is attached;&nbsp; for surely it was not intended that it should be composed and attached for nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the contractor&nbsp; who provides and places it gets no pay for it as a separate part of the work, then he undoubtedly gets it as a part&nbsp; of some other&nbsp; work&nbsp; or structure.<br><br>As we have seen, it is provided in the contract that the whole&nbsp; interior&nbsp; of the reservoir&nbsp; was to be lined, certain parts with plaster coat,&nbsp; certain parts&nbsp; with 4&nbsp; inches&nbsp; of concrete surfaced with skim coat,&nbsp; and certain parts with skim&nbsp; coat&nbsp; alone.&nbsp;&nbsp; For part of&nbsp; this work&nbsp; payment&nbsp; was separately provided.&nbsp; For other parts&nbsp; no provision&nbsp; was made for separate payment.&nbsp; Unless such work,&nbsp; therefore, is paid for by being included&nbsp; as&nbsp; part of the&nbsp; price&nbsp; of other work, then&nbsp; the contractor,<i> under the terms of the contract</i>, is not entitled to pay for doing such work.&nbsp; This naturally and&nbsp; inevitably follows&nbsp; from the finding already made that the plaster coat is different from the&nbsp; skim coat and&nbsp; was intended&nbsp; for a purpose&nbsp; which&nbsp; the&nbsp; use of the latter&nbsp; would not&nbsp; accomplish.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; can not fairly be assumed, however, that a contractor will voluntarily furnish materials and perform services for nothing; and we are accordingly forced to the conclusion that&nbsp; he received his compensation for the&nbsp; skim coat through&nbsp; the&nbsp; medium of the structure to which the skim coat&nbsp; was attached.&nbsp; And this is&nbsp; precisely the contention of the&nbsp; city in this case, as presented in the words of the chief engineer when he stated in&nbsp; his letter to the defendant, the Matson, Lord &amp; Belser Co., that Mr. Thurber confounded the plaster coat on <i>unlined </i>sections of the tunnel with the skim coat "required as the <i>finish for concrete lining</i>" and asserted the proposition that the "skim coat finish is included in the price for concrete lining as per paragraph 17, page 63 of the contract." The paragraph referred to reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"17.&nbsp; The prices hereinafter stipulated for concrete lining and for concrete in parapet walls and elsewhere shall include the entire cost of the materials&nbsp; and labor&nbsp; for the finished work.&nbsp; It&nbsp; shall include the cost of expansion joints&nbsp; as herein before specified, and shall&nbsp; also include the cost of all forms, centers, and any other work incidental to the mixing and placing&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; finished&nbsp; concrete masonry."<br></blockquote>When the excavation for the reservoir was complete the sides thereof were composed of various materials: a portion consisted of solid rock without defects; a portion was composed of rock with defects; while still another portion was earth.&nbsp; In finishing the reservoir, that is, in lining it, these various&nbsp; materials composing the sides as excavated,&nbsp; in order to finish the reservoir&nbsp; for&nbsp; satisfactory and enduring results,&nbsp; required different treatment, depending on the materials which composed them.&nbsp; That this was so is evident. The sides composed&nbsp; of earth&nbsp; or defective rock&nbsp; must be lined&nbsp; differently from the&nbsp; sides formed by solid rock free from defects, if the work was to be done in a workmanlike manner.&nbsp; To meet this requirement there was inserted in the contract paragraph 14, division&nbsp; E,&nbsp; above quoted.&nbsp; Under its&nbsp; provisions the plaster coat was the only thing required to be placed on the sides composed of perfect rock. But "on all surfaces of&nbsp; embankments&nbsp; (earth),&nbsp; defective rock, or elsewhere where ordered by the engineer, a layer of concrete 4 inches in thickness shall be placed, <i>and this layer shall be finished with a top skim coat </i>conforming in all respects to the skim coat specified&nbsp; for lined sections of the tunnel."&nbsp; Now, take this&nbsp; provision in connection with that in&nbsp; paragraph 17 above quoted which says that&nbsp; "the prices hereinafter stipulated for <i>concrete lining</i>&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; * shall include the <i>entire cost of materials and&nbsp; labor</i> for the <i>finished work</i>," and the inference&nbsp; is&nbsp; clear that the skim coat is a part of the <i>finished</i> concrete&nbsp; lining.&nbsp;&nbsp; When paragraph 14 said&nbsp; that the 4-inch concrete layer should be "finished with&nbsp; a top skim coat," it&nbsp; meant that such lining would not ue complete, <i>as a lining</i>, until it had received such skim-coat finish.&nbsp; This being so, it follows necessarily that the placing of the skim coat was paid for when the concrete was paid for.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; payment&nbsp; for the&nbsp; latter was provided for in item 39, page 78 of the&nbsp; contract, which&nbsp; reads:<br><blockquote><i>"Item 39</i>. - For Portland cement concrete masonry lining on reservoir, composed of 1 part Portland cement, 2 1/2 parts sand, 5 parts broken stone or gravel, the sum of nine dollars and eighteen cents&nbsp; ($9.18) per cubic&nbsp; yard."<br></blockquote>This is one of the ''prices" referred to in paragraph 17 of division E, page 63 of contract, above quoted when it said: "The prices hereinafter stipulated for concrete lining and for concrete in&nbsp; parapet walls and elsewhere&nbsp; shall include the entire cost of materials and labor for the finished work." Moreover, the&nbsp; provisions&nbsp; of the&nbsp; contract relating to the tunnel require&nbsp; the&nbsp; contractor, under certain conditions, to introduce concrete as a lining for the tunnel.&nbsp; It appears clear that the concrete lining so required is&nbsp; of the same genera] character as the concrete lining required for certain parts of the reservoir and&nbsp; for the same reasons.&nbsp; Having this in mind, the terms of paragraph 20 of division D, page 60 of the contract, relative to the construction of the tunnel, are interesting&nbsp; and&nbsp; significant.&nbsp; They are:<br><blockquote>"20. The quantity of concrete to be paid for&nbsp; shall be that actually built in accordance with the plans and specifications and the requirements of the engineer thereunder. The prices herein stipulated per&nbsp; cubic yard for concrete shall include the total cost of labor and materials, including the skim coat and water stop herein before described.&nbsp;&nbsp; The plaster coat&nbsp; on unlined sections&nbsp; or portions of sections shall be paid for at the stipulated price&nbsp; per square&nbsp; yard.. Said&nbsp; payments&nbsp; shall include all&nbsp; expenses&nbsp; incidental to the furnishing&nbsp; of materials and construction of the tunnel."<br></blockquote>Here, as is seen, the skim coat is expressly required as a part of the concrete lining which would be incomplete&nbsp; without it.&nbsp; We can see no&nbsp; good reason for holding that concrete lining which is not&nbsp; complete without the skim coat in one&nbsp; place is&nbsp; complete without it in another when such lining is precisely the same and serves precisely equivalent purposes in both cases.&nbsp;&nbsp; We are aware that it may be urged that the skim coat&nbsp; having been&nbsp; in the&nbsp; one case expressly required to complete the&nbsp; lining and in the other not expressly required, the presumption might well be that&nbsp; it was not the intention to require it in the&nbsp; latter case. , This argument would be&nbsp; sound if it were not for the fact that the provisions&nbsp; of the contract under consideration on the subject, although not direct, are so clear in their general intendment as&nbsp; to amount in law substantially to express provision.<br><br>In addition it should&nbsp; be borne in mind that paragraph 30, page 66 of the contract, provides that:<br><blockquote>"The entire specifications for&nbsp; all portions of the work of building&nbsp; the gravity water supply&nbsp; complete shall&nbsp; be considered&nbsp; as a&nbsp; whole, and items specified&nbsp; under one&nbsp; class of work which&nbsp; are applicable to another&nbsp; class shall be of force and effect though&nbsp; not specifically mentioned."<br></blockquote>We also feel the force of plaintiffs' contention based on the fact that the fanners&nbsp; of the&nbsp; contract once&nbsp; used the words "plaster coating" as&nbsp; a substitute for&nbsp; the words "skim coat."&nbsp;&nbsp; We&nbsp; do not believe, however, that&nbsp; decisive&nbsp; weight ought to be&nbsp; given to that fact.&nbsp; The words&nbsp; used are not precisely the same as "plaster coat" and, as appears from the context, they were used in the general sense.<br><br>The plaintiffs lay much stress on the wording of paragraph 28 of Article IV, headed "General Specifications - General Conditions.&nbsp; Information for&nbsp; Bidders,"&nbsp; wherein, estimating the quantities of work to be done, the amount of "plaster coat for reservoir" is estimated at 43,500 square yards.&nbsp; It&nbsp; should&nbsp; be borne in mind, however, in gauging the strength of plaintiffs' argument in this regard that, prior to actual excavation, the character of the&nbsp; soil to be met with could not accurately be determined.&nbsp; It could not be known to a certainty what proportion of the sides of the reservoir would be solid&nbsp; rock clear of defects, and what part&nbsp; defective&nbsp; rock or&nbsp; earth.&nbsp; As&nbsp; a matter&nbsp; of&nbsp; necessity, therefore, each party was obliged to take his chance on the amount of each particular kind of side, and, consequently, on the amount of plaster coat and skin coat that would be required.&nbsp;&nbsp; Paragraph 28 meets this condition of uncertainty by providing that the estimates of "quantities of work to be done" shall be "subject to change."<br><br>It is&nbsp; admitted by the plaintiff, by the testimony of Mr. Thurber, that all of the skim coat&nbsp; for the&nbsp; composing and placing of&nbsp; which it is in this action demanding&nbsp; payment was&nbsp; attached to the concrete&nbsp; lining inside the&nbsp; reservoir described in&nbsp; paragraph 14, page 63 of the contract.<br><br>The foregoing reasons&nbsp; lead us to&nbsp; affirm the judgment of the&nbsp; court below.&nbsp; No&nbsp; special finding as to costs.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Torres,&nbsp; Mapa, Johnson, </i>and&nbsp; <i>Carson,&nbsp; JJ.,</i> concur.<br></div>
