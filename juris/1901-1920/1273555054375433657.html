				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The defendant in this case was convicted of the crime of homicide&nbsp; in the&nbsp; Court of First Instance&nbsp; of Masbate and sentenced&nbsp; to six years and one day of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision mayor</span>,&nbsp; to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P500 and to pay the costs of the trial. The defendant appealed.<br><br>It&nbsp; appears&nbsp; that the accused,&nbsp; being a&nbsp; member of the municipal&nbsp; board&nbsp; of the municipality of Dimas-Alang, subprovince of Masbate, Sorsogon, on or about the 31st day of December, 1905, in the court-house of said municipality, assaulted&nbsp; one&nbsp; Pedro Abejero by kicking and striking him, thereby causing various contusions upon his body, particularly in a portion of the head just back of and below the left ear, and in the right side.&nbsp; By reason&nbsp; of these wounds the injured party was at once confined&nbsp; to his bed and died in consequence of such injuries&nbsp; on the third&nbsp; day after receiving&nbsp; them.<br><br>The proofs&nbsp; of the parties&nbsp; in this case&nbsp; are in complete contradiction.<br><br>Camilo&nbsp; Samson, a witness for the prosecution, testified that on a certain occasion he was called by the mother&nbsp; of the injured party above mentioned and found him in bed, unable to&nbsp; speak; that&nbsp; he noticed&nbsp; that the head&nbsp; and neck just back of and below the left ear, near the throat, appeared to be discolored&nbsp; to a&nbsp; certain extent; that the ribs&nbsp; upon the right&nbsp; side appeared to be inflamed and that when he pressed his hand over that portion the&nbsp; injured&nbsp; person appeared to suffer pain.<br><br>Francisco Avenir, another witness for the prosecution, testified that during the month of January, 1906, the said deceased was&nbsp; in the court-house&nbsp; aforesaid and&nbsp; that the accused asked him why he had not cleaned the&nbsp; street&nbsp; in front of the court-house;&nbsp; that the deceased answered that he had not yet been able to do&nbsp; so as he had been occupied in other duties; that thereupon the&nbsp; accused struck him a blow with&nbsp; his fist under the left ear which felled&nbsp; him&nbsp; to the floor;&nbsp; that thereupon the accused with the heel of his shoe kicked him in the side below the ribs; that the deceased died on the 3d day of January, about three days after he had been thus assaulted.<br><br>Juan Morada, another witness for the prosecution, swore that the deceased died on the 3d day of January, 1906; that the witness was called to see him; that when he saw him he was not able to eat and was in a condition of great agony; that he saw and observed that the skin was discolored below the left ear; that the mother of the deceased showed the witness&nbsp; a contusion&nbsp; upon the right side&nbsp; over the lower ribs; that the witness noticed at that time that the lower rib projected beyond the others and that it had a mark upon it about the size of a shoe heel.<br><br>The last&nbsp; witness&nbsp; for the&nbsp; prosecution,&nbsp; Julian Amante, declared that the accused&nbsp; beat the deceased in the court-house&nbsp; aforesaid; that he first struck him a blow with his fist below the ear which felled&nbsp; the&nbsp; deceased to&nbsp; the floor; that thereupon the accused with the heel of his shoe kicked him in the&nbsp; right side below&nbsp; the&nbsp; ribs; that this occurred on Monday, the 1st day of January, 1906.<br><br>The medical expert produced by&nbsp; the prosecution,&nbsp; Dr. Julio Ruiz, a licensed physician, who was at the time the sanitary inspector of the district&nbsp; of&nbsp; Sorsogon, testified as follows:<br><blockquote>"Q.&nbsp; State, from the experience&nbsp; you have had&nbsp; as a&nbsp; physician, what would happen to a man if he should receive from another a blow with the fist&nbsp; on&nbsp; this part of the right side of the neck, below the ear, which blow had occasioned a bruise resulting in a swelling and&nbsp; a discoloration of the part touched by the fist? - A.&nbsp; A tumefaction of the tissues and a livid color or wound from a heavy blow in this region indicate a severe contusion of the tissues and, considering the organs&nbsp; situated&nbsp; partly in this region, the pathologic phenomena&nbsp; that&nbsp; may&nbsp; be suffered can be&nbsp; very&nbsp; different. The tumefaction and the black color denote an extravasation of the blood on the inside.&nbsp;&nbsp; As in&nbsp; this region&nbsp; there&nbsp; are blood vessels and nerves&nbsp; and the larynx,&nbsp; which are very delicate organs, and this blow, as I&nbsp; said before, was&nbsp; undoubtedly the result of a&nbsp; quarrel and must&nbsp; have been&nbsp; a violent one; in these conditions, there is not only extravasation of the blood, but also a traumatic inflammation may be produced in a part of the larynx, and this inflammation gives rise to&nbsp; an oedema which&nbsp; hinders respiration, for it&nbsp; is through&nbsp; this orifice that the air necessarily&nbsp; must pass. The cerebral circulation will be retarded by the compression, and these nerves give life to the respiratory&nbsp; movements also; so that various&nbsp; phenomena can be produced in consequence of this contusion.&nbsp;&nbsp; At all events, the symptoms shown by him were those of a serious injury.<br><br>"Q. Do you believe&nbsp; that the individual&nbsp; who received that blow could swallow food? - A. It would be very difficult to swallow food, much more so while the patient was in this condition of the development of the contusion; it would be very difficult to&nbsp; take food, and especially liquids.<br><br>"Q. If this same individual&nbsp; who received the blow&nbsp; on the right side&nbsp; of&nbsp; the neck&nbsp; had fallen&nbsp; to the floor and received&nbsp; a blow with&nbsp; a shoe heel on&nbsp; this part of the last right rib, or&nbsp; on the right side,&nbsp; by&nbsp; a&nbsp; man as strong as&nbsp; is the accused - and&nbsp; if,&nbsp; as a&nbsp; result of&nbsp; this shoe-heel blow in the region&nbsp; of the lower rib, this rib was crushed inward, what might be the result&nbsp; or what might happen to&nbsp; the patient? - A.&nbsp; Such a&nbsp; blow is&nbsp; still more serious than&nbsp; the first blow received on the side of the neck.&nbsp; In this region is the liver.&nbsp; It is supposed that this blow was produced by a hard body, and from the condition in which the accused probably was and considering that the blow was the result of a quarrel, it is to be supposed that&nbsp; it was a very violent one. This blow could have produced a rent in the liver in the right lobule and an effusion of the bile, which&nbsp; would give rise&nbsp; to inflammations of the peritoneum, that is, to peritonitis.&nbsp; In the first moment of this blow the individual must have fallen into a syncope through a traumatic shock, which is always produced and always shown in those heavy contusions of the&nbsp; organs;&nbsp; and&nbsp; if the rib was fractured, the condition was more serious.<br><br>"Q. In your opinion, after all the contusions and&nbsp; blows you have just&nbsp; mentioned, could the&nbsp; man&nbsp; live? - A. The most prudent opinion is that the man could not have withstood the phenomena produced&nbsp; by both blows.&nbsp; They&nbsp; in themselves,&nbsp; considered&nbsp; separately,&nbsp; are&nbsp; sufficient causes&nbsp; to have produced death."</blockquote>From the testimony&nbsp; above&nbsp; epitomized it appears established&nbsp; with&nbsp; sufficient conclusiveness&nbsp; that&nbsp; the death&nbsp; of Abejero was caused by the injuries which are alleged&nbsp; to have been inflicted by the accused.&nbsp; As to whether or not such injuries&nbsp; were actually sustained at the hands of the accused, we are unable&nbsp; to say, after a careful examination of the evidence,&nbsp; that the&nbsp; conclusions of the court below in that&nbsp; regard are not well founded in the proofs.&nbsp; The witnesses upon that point are in direct contradiction, those for the&nbsp; Government testifying one&nbsp; way and those of the defense&nbsp; the other.&nbsp; Under such circumstances the credibility of the witnesses is, of course,&nbsp; of the&nbsp; utmost&nbsp; importance. There being little on the face of the record from which that may&nbsp; be judged, we&nbsp; must rely&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the&nbsp; judgment and discretion of the trial court who saw the witnesses in the act of testifying and judged of their relative truthfulness. Having&nbsp; this in mind, we are satisfied that the conclusion of the court below upon the facts is fully justified by the evidence.<br><br>The objection to the conviction of the&nbsp; defendant which is argued at greatest length by his attorney is founded upon the fact that the trial court adjourned the&nbsp; trial&nbsp; of the cause from&nbsp; September, 1908, to the succeeding term of the court which was held in February, 1909.&nbsp;&nbsp; Counsel for the defendant held this adjournment to be an abuse&nbsp; of discretion.&nbsp;&nbsp; In making&nbsp; this adjournment of the trial, the court said:<br><blockquote>"By reason of the gravity of the charges which are made against the accused, I am going to adjourn this cause until the next session of the&nbsp; court in spite of the opposition&nbsp; of the counsel for defendant.&nbsp; In view of the fact that Julian Amante has not appeared in court, notwithstanding&nbsp; that he was&nbsp; duly subpoenaed,&nbsp; and by reason&nbsp; of&nbsp; the fact&nbsp; that the&nbsp; witness Epifania Barruga&nbsp; is&nbsp; sick of fever,&nbsp; and by reason of the fact that the fiscal does not know what the witnesses will testify to, and also by reason of the fact that it is&nbsp; the first&nbsp; time that this cause has been brought&nbsp; on for trial, the cause may be adjourned for a term, especially in view&nbsp; of the fact that the&nbsp; accused&nbsp; is admitted to bail."</blockquote>Under the circumstances of the case, we do not&nbsp; believe that the court below abused&nbsp; its discretion in ordering&nbsp; an adjournment of the cause.<br><br>The judgment of the court below is affirmed, with costs against the appellant.<br><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>Arellano, C.&nbsp; J., Mapa, Johnson,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Carson, JJ.,</span>&nbsp; concur.<br><br><br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="center"><br><br><center><br><i>DISSENTING</i><br></center><br><br><b> TORRES, <i> J.</i>, </b><br><br>The writer, with&nbsp; due respect&nbsp; to&nbsp; the decision&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; the majority, believes, however,&nbsp; following the opinion&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Attorney-General, that the&nbsp; special circumstance&nbsp; of&nbsp; article 11 of the Penal Code can not be taken into account in favor of the defendant,&nbsp; and&nbsp; that,&nbsp; even if it be considered&nbsp; as present,&nbsp; it&nbsp; is not&nbsp; very marked, according to article&nbsp; 81, paragraph 5, of&nbsp; the&nbsp; code.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, the&nbsp; presence&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; the mitigating circumstance No.&nbsp; 3&nbsp; of&nbsp; article 9 of&nbsp; the same code being the only one that may&nbsp; be taken into account, it is my opinion that&nbsp; the defendant should be&nbsp; sentenced to twelve years and one day of <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion temporal</span>, with the accessory penalties of&nbsp; article 59 of the Penal&nbsp; Code, and to pay an&nbsp; indemnity&nbsp; and costs.</div>
