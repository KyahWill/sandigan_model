				G.R. No. 1462, April 08, 1904</h4>
				<H3>LA RAZON SOCIAL DE HIJOS DE I. DE LA RAMA, PLAINTIFFS AND APPELLANTS, VS. ROSENDO LACSON, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>COOPER, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The plaintiffs brought this action against Don Rosendo Lacson for the 
recovery of the sum of 2,950 pesos. The instrument upon which the demand is 
founded is as follows, to wit:
<blockquote>
<p>"I acknowledge to be in debt to Don Esteban de la Rama in the sum of 2,950 
pesos, and in security for the same I sign these presents.</p></blockquote>
<p align="right">"R. Lacson.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"July 10, 1897."</p></blockquote>
<p>This document was transferred by successive indorsements to the 
plaintiff.</p>
<p>It is alleged in the complaint that the said sum of money was loaned without 
interest and without a, fixed time of payment.</p>
<p>In his answer the defendant sets up as a defense that the note was given in 
consideration of a debt won by the plaintiff from the defendant in a game of 
monte.</p>
<p>The Court of First Instance found that the note was given for a gambling debt 
and held it upon these grounds to be invalid.</p>
<p>It is expressly provided in article 1798 of the Civil Code that no action can 
be founded upon a claim for a debt won in a game of chance, luck, or hazard.</p>
<p>This question arose in the case of Jose Escalante <em>vs.</em> Venancio 
Francisco (1 Off. Gaz., 855<span class="style2"><sup>[1]</sup></span>) and in the 
case of Palma vs. Canizares (1 Off. Gaz., 516<span class="style2"><sup>[2]</sup></span>), which were suits founded upon notes the 
consideration of which were gambling debts. In these cases we have held that 
such actions can not be maintained.</p>
<p>The Court of First Instance properly rendered judgment in favor of the 
defendant and the judgment must be affirmed, with the cost of proceedings 
adjudged against the plaintiff, which is accordingly done.</p>
<p><em>Torres, McDonough,</em> and <em>Johnson, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J.,</em> and <em>Mapa, J.,</em> dissent.</p>
