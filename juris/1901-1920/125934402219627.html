				<BR><STRONG>LADD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> The offense with which the defendant was charged and of which he has been convicted is that defined in section 14 of Act No. 292 of the United States Philippine Commission, which is as follows:  "Any person  who shall have taken any oath before any military officer of the Army of the United States, or before any officer under  the Civil Government of the Philippine Islands, whether such official so administering the oath was specially authorized by law so to do or not,  in which oath  the affiant in substance engaged  to recognize or  accept the supreme authority of the United States of America in these Islands or to maintain true faith and allegiance thereto or to obey the laws, legal  orders, and  decrees promulgated by  its duly constituted  authorities and  who shall, after the passage of this act, violate the  terms  and  provisions  of such oath or any of such terms or provisions, shall be punished by a fine not  exceeding  two thousand dollars or by imprisonment not exceeding ten years, or both."</p>
<p> The  defendant is a former insurgent officer and  is entitled to the benefit of the proclamation of amnesty if the offense is one of those to which the proclamation applies. Assuming, for the purposes of the present motion, that the defendant is guilty of the offense, there is no evidence in the record showing that it was committed  pursuant to orders issued by the civil or military insurrectionary authorities, or that it grew  out of internal political feuds or dissensions between Filipinos and Spaniards or the Spanish  authorities, or that it resulted from internal political feuds or dissensions among the Filipinos  themselves.  If it is covered by the amnesty it must be because it  is embraced within the  words employed in  the  proclamation to designate the first class, of offenses amnestied, namely, "offenses of treason and sedition."</p>
<p> If these  words are to be given  a construction  in accordance with their strict  technical signification, there will be some difficulty in holding  that they include the offense in question.  Treason is defined in section 1 of Act No. 292 to consist in levying war against the United States or the Government  of the Philippine Islands, or adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the Philippine Islands or elsewhere.   Sedition is defined in section 5 of the same act as the rising publicly and tumultuously in order to obtain by force or outside of legal methods certain enumerated objects of a political character.  A violation of an oath containing the comprehensive engagements of that in question may be committed without by the same act committing either the crime of treason or that of sedition as thus defined, as, for example, in the case of a conspiracy to commit these crimes or to commit the crime of insurrection.   (Act No. 292, sees. 3, 4, 7.)  And, conversely, the crime of treason or that of sedition may be committed, without a  violation of the oath of allegiance when it is committed, as it, of course, may be, by a person who has never taken such oath.   The act, therefore, by which the offense of violation of oaths of  allegiance, as defined in section 14 of Act No. 292, is committed, is not necessarily  identical, although it  may  be  in particular cases,  with that by  which the technical crime of treason or that of sedition  is committed.  And in all  cases the offense of violation  of an oath of  allegiance  involves, in a sense,  an  element, namely,  the breaking  of an express promise, which may not be present in treason or sedition.</p>
<p> In the present case the act by which the defendant is found by the court below to have violated the oath was that of denying to an officer of the United States Army the existence of certain rifles,  which had been concealed by his orders at the time of his surrender in  April, 1901, and of the existence and whereabouts of which he was cognizant at the time of the denial.  If this act was a violation of the oath, which upon the evidence  in the case may  be doubtful, it was probably also an act of treason, as being an act of adhering to the enemies of the United States,  giving them aid and comfort, and if the element of breach of promise is to be  regarded as merely  an incidental circumstance forming no part of the essence of the crime of  violation of oaths of allegiance, the  offense in this  particular  case might, perhaps, be held to be covered by the  amnesty as being,  in substance, treason  though prosecuted  under another name.</p>
<p> We prefer, however, to base our decision upon a broader ground, and one which will cover all cases of prosecution for the offense of violation of oaths of allegiance.  </p>
<p> There are a variety of offenses in the criminal codes of all countries which are not directed primarily against individuals, but rather against the existence of the state, the authority of the government or the general public tranquillity.   All or nearly all of the offenses created and denned in Act No. 292 are distinctly of this character.  Among them are treason properly so called (section 1), misprision of treason  (section 2), insurrection (section 3), conspiracy to commit  treason or insurrection  (section  4),  sedition properly so called (sections 5 and 6), conspiracy to commit sedition (section 7), seditious  words and libels (section 8), the formation of secret political societies  (section 9), and finally the offense in question (section  14).  The line of distinction between  some of  these offenses  is often difficult to draw.  They are all closely related and may all be embraced under the general description of offenses of a treasonable and seditious nature.  When the  framer of the proclamation  used the words "treason and sedition" to describe the purely political  offenses  covered by the amnesty, we think it was his intention, without specially enumerating the political offenses defined in Act No. 292, to include them all under those two general heads.</p>
<p> Treason, in its  more general sense, is the "violation by a subject of his allegiance to his sovereign  or liege lord, or to the supreme authority of the state."   (Century Dictionary. )   Sedition, in its more general  sense, is "the raising of commotions or disturbances in the state."   (Bouvier's Law Dictionary, title "Sedition.")  Technical terms of the law whqn used in a statute are ordinarily to be given their technical signification.   But in construing  an  executive act of the character of this proclamation, as in construing a remedial statute, a court is justified in applying a more liberal rule of  construction in order to effectuate, if possible, the beneficent purpose intended.  Certainly a limitation of the  words in question to their literal and technical signification  would utterly defeat the unmistakable general  object  of  the amnesty.   Upon  such  a construction treason, the highest of all political  crimes, a crime which may be punished by death under section 1 of Act No. 292, would  be included in the  amnesty, while insurrection, which is a crime of precisely the same nature and differs from it solely in being inferior in degree and punishable by fine  and imprisonment only, would  be excluded,  A construction leading to such manifest inconsistencies could be accepted only when the language  admitted of no other. We think  the  construction  suggested as  the  true one though  somewhat  less restricted than the precise legal signification of the terms "treason"  and  "sedition?' might warrant, may be  adopted without doing violence to the language of the proclamation,  and  there is no room for doubt in our minds that by adopting that construction we carry out the real intention of the President.</p>
<p> We hold, therefore, that the offense of violation of oaths of allegiance, being one of the political offenses defined  in Act No. 292, is included in the general words "treason and seditibn," as  used in  the proclamation.  The defendant is entitled to the  benefits of the proclamation, and  upon filing in this  court the prescribed oath the cause will  be returned to the court below with directions that he be discharged.  So ordered.</p>
<p> <em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Cooper,</em> and <em>Willard, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p> <em>Smith</em> and <em>Mapa, JJ., </em>did not sit in this case.</p>
