				<H3>DANIEL TANCHOGO, PLAINTIFF AND  APPELLEE, VS.  SIMPLICIO SUAREZ ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This action was commenced in  the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila by the plaintiff to recover of the defendants the sum of 420 pesos, upon a promissory note, which note was alleged  to have been executed and delivered on the 5th of December, 1904.</p>
<p>The defendant Marciano Eraña  did not appear in said cause.  The defendant Simplicio Suarez appeared and filed a general and a special denial.  At the close of said cause the lower court rendered a judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant Simplicio Suarez for the full amount of said promissory note.   From this decision the said Simplicio Suarez appealed to this court.</p>
<p>The plaintiff claims that by the terms of the said promissory  note  the defendants  were liable "de mancomune&nbsp; insolidum." </p>
<p>In the special answer of the defendants, Simplicio Suarez practically admits the execution of the  said promissory note, together with the said Marciano Eraña, but denies that by the terms of the note he was individually liable for the payment of the full amount.</p>
<p>No motion for a new trial was made in the court below and none of the evidence was made a part of the bill of exceptions, not even the promissory note.  This court can not, therefore, review the evidence.  (Ismael <em>vs</em>. Ganzon, 1 Phil.  Rep., 454;_Thunga Chui <em>vs</em>. Que Bentec, 1 Phil. Rep.,1 356; Pastor <em>vs</em>. Gaspar, 2  Phil. Rep., 592; Sugar Estates Co. <em>vs</em>. Del Rosario, 2 Phil. Rep., 651.)</p>
<p>The question before this court presented by the record is, Are the facts stated in the opinion of the lower court, together with those admitted  in the pleadings, sufficient to sustain the judgment of the lower court?</p>
<p>The only fact admitted by the pleadings is that said note was executed and delivered by the appellant Suarez and his  codefendant, as alleged in the complaint, and the lower court found as a fact in his judgment that the defendants were liable "de mancomum  6 ins61idum."  These facts are sufficient to justify the conclusion of the lower court that the defendant Simplicio Suarez was liable individually for the payment of the full amount of the said note with interest and costs.</p>
<p>The judgment of the lower court is therefore affirmed, with interest at 6 per cent from the date of the judgment of the lower court,  and  costs.   After the expiration  of twenty days from the date hereof let judgment be entered in accordance  herewith and  ten days thereafter  let  the case be remanded  to the court  below for proper action. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano,  C.  J., Torres,  Mapa,  Carson, Willard,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
