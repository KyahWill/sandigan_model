				<BR><STRONG>AVANCEÃ‘A, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In this case the plaintiff claims from the defendant the payment of the sums 
of P7,779.76, P1,225.04 and P1,500, which make the total of P10,504.80. The 
defendant, on the other hand, demands from the plaintiff, as a counterclaim, the 
sum of five thousand six hundred dollars ($5,600). At the trial on October 29, 
1917, counsel for both parties appeared and, after hearing the evidence of the 
plaintiff, the counsel for the defendant asked the court to grant him a fix time 
within which to present the evidence for the defense on the ground that the 
defendant, who was a witness, had not yet arrived. The counsel for the defendant 
also asked the court that, at all events, the right to bring a separate action 
for the recovery of the sum mentioned in the defendant's counterclaim be 
reserved to him. The court denied these requests and, after the trial of case, 
rendered its decision, on the 30th of the said month, absolving the plaintiff 
from the counterclaim and sentencing the defendant to pay to the plaintiff the 
sums of P7,779.76 with interest at the rate of 9 per cent per annum beginning 
January 25, 1916, until the full payment of P1,225.04, and of P1,500, together 
with the costs. From this decision the defendant appealed, and in this instance 
assigns the following errors:
<blockquote><p>"1. The court erred in pronouncing judgment with the case intthe condition it 
was on the day of trial.</p>
<p>"2. The court erred in overruling the motion of the defendant praying for the 
reservation of a separate action for the sum mentioned in his counterclaim.</p>
<p>"3. The court erred in absolving the plaintiff from the counterclaim or cross 
complaint.</p>
<p>"4. The court erred in sentencing the defendant to pay plaintiff the sums he 
demanded."</p></blockquote>
<p>These assignments of error do not merit any consideration, unless, under the 
supposition that the defendant may have satisfactorily explained his 
non-appearance on the day of the trial of the case. However the defendant has 
neither submitted, nor tried to submit, any explanation of his non- 
appearance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, after reviewing the evidence, we have found that it sufficiently 
justifies the decision of the court.</p>
<p>In regard to the motion by which the right shall be reserved to the defendant 
to present his counterclaim in a separate action against the plaintiff, it ought 
to be observed that, according to the allegations in the briefs of the parties, 
this counterclaim necessarily has a bearing on the complaint and, in accordance 
with section 97 of the Code of Civil Procedure, must be set up in this same 
action, on pain of defendant losing his right of action. Wherefore, the 
reservation by which the defendant would be able to present his counterclaim in 
a separate action against the plaintiff is tantamount to depriving the plaintiff 
of defense against the counterclaim, a defense which this section 97 grants him 
in the event that this counterclaim is not set up in said action. The court 
cannot arbitrarily deprive the plaintiff of this right, as would have done had 
the motion of the defendant been granted. Consequently, the court did not err in 
overruling the said motion.</p>
<p>From another view point, considering the appellant as plaintiff in connection 
with his counterclaim asking for the dismissal of this counterclaim without 
prejudice to the right of presenting, it as a principal action at some later 
time, the court did not err in overruling this motion. Section 127 of the Code 
of Civil Procedure allows the dismissal of an action at the request of the 
plaintiff <span style="font-style: italic;">provided a counterclaim may not have been presented</span>. As a counterclaim 
always takes for granted a complaint, it appears that, for the same reason the 
dismissal of a counterclaim, with a reservation by which it may be presented 
again by means of another action, ought not to be permitted. Courts can, in 
their discretion, deny the setting aside of any case whatsoever when the 
defendant has already prepared for the trial in such a way that to allow the 
setting aside of a case without a hearing in conformity with law would be 
unjust. Such is the circumstance in the present case, for the plaintiff appeared 
on the day fixed, not only by his complaint but also by the counterclaim of the 
defendant, presented his evidence, and submitted the case for decision. Under 
such conditions it would have been unjust to the plaintiff not to take action on 
the counterclaim of the defendant.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed with the costs against the 
appellant. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Johnson, Araullo, Street</em>, and <em>Malcolm, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p></div>
