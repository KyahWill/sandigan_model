  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The record in this case was received in this court from the Court  of First Instance on the 30th of March,  1905. It was ordered transferred to the Attorney-General's office on April 5, 1905,  in order  that the testimony might be translated  into Spanish.  When it was received here, and when it was sent to the Attorney-General's office, it contained a certificate of the stenographer to the  effect that the testimony  therein contained was all of the  evidence taken by him in the case.  That testimony was limited to the evidence of the defendant's  witnesses and one witness of the Government in  rebuttal.  When  it was returned from the  Attorney-General's office, the  translation contained a statement to the effect  that the fiscal in the court below presented as proof the signed statements made by the witnesses who were examined before the justice of the peace in the preliminary investigation.  The record when transferred to  the Attorney-General's office, contained no such statement, and it must  therefore be  disregarded.</p>
<p>We think it sufficiently appears from the original record sent here from the court below that six witnesses  were presented by the Government at the trial of the case in the Court of First  Instance.  The evidence of these witnesses was not preserved  as required  by section 32  of General Orders, No. 58. The five pages of manuscript apparently purporting to contain an abstract of the testimony of these witnesses,  but not  signed by anyone nor certified  to  be correct by  anyone, was not in compliance with the provisions of said section.</p>
<p>We do not have before us, therefore, the evidence which was presented in  the trial court.   In accordance with the decisions in the cases of U. S. <em>vs</em>. Pablo Tan<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> (4 Off. Gaz., 177), U. S. <em>vs</em>. Hollis<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> (4 Off. Gaz., 152),  and  U. S <em>vs</em>. Quilatan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> (3 Off.  Gaz., 414) the judgment must be reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>
<p>The judgment is  accordingly reversed and the case remanded to the court below for a new trial.  At the new trial it will not be necessary to retake the evidence already taken,  but either party  may introduce such  additional evidence as  he sees fit.   At  the expiration of ten days judgment should  be  entered in accordance with this decision and the case remanded to  the court below for execution of said judgment.   So ordered.</p>
<em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Carson,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
