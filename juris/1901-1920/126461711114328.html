				<H3>JOSE ACUNA,  PLAINTIFF AND  APPELLEE, VS.  MUNICIPALITY OR THE CITY OF ILOILO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.

				<BR><STRONG>COOPER, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On the 16th of  March,  1901,  the appellee, Jose Acuna, made a contract with Fermin del Rosario, the then  municipal attorney of the city of Iloilo, as representative of the municipality,  by  which  Seiior Acuiia undertook from the 18th day of March until the 31st day of  December, 1901, the performance  of  the service  of cleaning  and watering the streets comprehended within a certain zone in the  city of Iloilo, for which he was to receive the sum of 450 pesos monthly, to be paid at the end of each month.</p>
<p>About four months after the celebration of the contract the provincial governor of Iloilo, by letter written to the president of the municipality,  ordered the municipal council to rescind all contracts then  existing between that  municipality and persons contracting with it.</p>
<p>In compliance with this direction the municipal council, on the 29th day of June,  1901,  declared as  rescinded  the contract above referred to.</p>
<p>Senor Acuna instituted this action in the Court of First Instance of Iloilo to recover from the municipality indemnification for liis damages, by reason of the failure of the city to comply with the terms of the contract, alleging the amount to be 2,220 pesos.</p>
<p>The city of Iloilo answered the complaint, justifying its Action on the grounds that the rescission had been  made in obedience to the order of the provincial governor, and further that the  municipal attorney had no authority to execute the contract, and that the contract was invalid.</p>
<p>To this a.llegation the plaintiff replied that, if the contract was  not valid at the date of its inception, it was subsequently  ratified by the municipal council.</p>
<p>The Court of First Instance rendered judgment in  favor of Senor Acuna for the sum of 700 pesos, with interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from the 1st day of January, 1902, and costs of suit.</p>
<p>The case is appealed by the city of Iloilo by bill of exception.</p>
<p>A number of errors have been assigned by the appellant. It will be necessary to  consider only that assignment which relates to the power of the municipal attorney to enter into the contract  in behalf of the city,  and the  assignment which relates to the sufficiency of the proof to show a subsequent ratification of the contract by the municipality.</p>
<p>Under the provisions of  article  53 of General Orders, No. 40, of the United States Military Governor, by and under which municipalities Avere created and governed, of dute the 29th day of March, 1900, it is provided that the governor of the province shall  be <em>ex officio president</em> of all ihe municipal  councils within the province and  shall have general supervisory charge of the municipal affairs of tin1 several towns and cities organized under the order.</p>
<p>While it is true that this provision of law was in  force at the date of the entering into  the contract, yet, at the time the provincial governor  directed the  cancellation of: the contract the Municipal Act,  as contained in General Orders, No. 40, had been repealed by act of the Philippine Commission, No. 82, for the organization of municipal governments in the Philippine Islands.  In this act the provisions referred to  as contained in article 53, General Orders, No. 40, were omitted, and at the date of the order of the provincial  governor directing the cancellation  of the contract he had no control over municipal affairs.</p>
<p>By clause 6 of article 33 of General Orders, No. 40, which was in force at the date of the making of the contract, the municipal council  was empowered to provide for lighting and sprinkling the streets.</p>
<p>Article 20 of said order created the office of municipal attorney and denned his duties and powers.  It imposed upon him the duty to attend to all suits and matters and things in which the town was legally interested; to give his advice  or opinion in writing whenever required by the alcalde  or  municipal  council;  to  act as censor of the minutes of the sessions of the  municipal council and all other documents  decreed  or provided for by the municipality; to attend all sessions of the council and to do and perform  all  such  things  touching his office  as may be required by ordinance or by the council.</p>
<p>The contract in  question purports to have been entered into by and between  Seiior Acuiia on the one part, and by Beiior Fermin del Rosario, as municipal attorney, in representation of the municipality.   It was signed in the name of Fermin  del Kosario and was approved by  Senor Jose M. Gay, <em>alcalde </em>of Iloilo.</p>
<p>It is very clear from  the provisions of  General Orders, No. 40, which has been cited, that the municipal attorney had no authority to  enter  into such a contract, and that the power to  make such contract was vested in the municipal council alone.</p>
<p>By article  39 of said  General Orders, No. 40, it is provided that the ayes and  noes of the council shall be taken upon the passage  of all ordinances and propositions to create any liability against the  town, and shall be entered upon the journal, and that the concurrence of the majority of the members shall be necessary  to the passage of  any ordinance or of any proposition creating indebtedness.</p>
<p>The contract between Acuna  and the municipal council was a contract creating an indebtedness under the provisions of this article, and it was necessary to the making of a valid contract that a concurrence of the majority of the members of the municipal council should be had.</p>
<p>It is not. claimed that any ordinance was passed by the municipal council under which the contract between Acuna and the municipal council was made.   All that was shown upon this subject at the trial was a resolution passed by the city council on the 7th day of March, 1901, which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The secretary having read the opinion of the municipal attorney, Soil or  Fermin del llosario, upon the communication received  from the contractor for the cleaning and watering of the streets of  this  city, wherein he asks an increase of l50  pesos per month over the  stipulated sum therefor or a  rescission of the  contract, the  members of the council resolved that  said contract be  rescinded  with the forfeiture of fhe  bond,  at the same time  tendering a vote of  confidence to  the  Heiior  Alcalde and that he take such action as he may  deem expedient in  order that this service be not  interrupted."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the terms of the contract with Acuna had been duly agreed upon  by  Acuiia and the municipal council, then the authority might have been conferred upon the <em>alcalde</em> to execute the contract in the name and in behalf of the city, but no such contract has been shown.   It  is clear that this resolution does  not  evidence any contract  between Acuiia. and the municipal council; on the contrary, it shows very clearly that the contract had not at  that time been entered into and that the proposition made by Acuna to the citv had been withdrawn.                    '</p>
<p>The subsequent ratification relied  upon by the  plaintiff arises  solely  from the fact that he had cleaned  and sprinkled the streets in accordance with the contract made with the municipal attorney, and had received his compensation for such work up to the time of the cancellation and rescission of the  contract.   It does not appear from whom he received  the  compensation,  or whether there was an allowance voted by the municipal council or otherwise, nor whether a majority of the  city council participated at any subsequent meeting which  may have occurred.   A ratification, whatever its form may be, must be made  by the principal or the party having  originally the authority to act. If a contract is not made in accordance with the law, and is invalid by reason of the failure to comply with its provisions, its ratification by the corporation requires the observance of the same formalities necessary for the making of a valid contract in the first instance.   The power to ratify necessarily presupposes the power to make the contract. In order that there should have been a valid ratification of the contract with Actifia the concurrence of a majority of the members of the  municipal  council was necessary, for this was the requirement  of  the law in order that the municipal council may have legally entered into the contract in the first instance.</p>
<p>If the express  provisions of the statute, in which the mode and manner of contracting by the municipal council is prescribed, can be dispensed with by subsequent ratification in a less formal way than that originally required,  or by officers who are not shown to have the authority to make such contract, this would result in virtually repealing the statute.</p>
<p>It appears from the record that Acuila has collected the full amount for the work which he performed and for which the city received the benefits.  It is, therefore, unnecessary to determine whether he could have maintained an action on an implied contract, or quantum merit it, for the  work and services actually performed.</p>
<p>For the reasons herein  indicated,  the  judgment of the lower court must be reversed  and the  cause  remanded, and the costs of this appeal is adjudged against the appellee, Jose Acuna.</p>
<p>It is so ordered and directed.</p>
<p> <em>Torres</em> and <em>Ladd, JJ.:</em></p>
<p>We concur in the opinion, but think that direction should be given that the case be remanded to the court below with instructions to enter judgment for the defendant.</p>
<p><em> Arellano, C. J.,</em> and <em>Willard, J.,</em> concur in the results  of this opinion.</p>
<p><em> Mapa </em>and McDonough, JJ., did not sit in this case.</p>
