				<BR><BR><div align="justify">By a public instrument dated June 11, 1914, the plaintiff sold to the 
defendant Marciana Felix, with the consent of her husband, the defendant Balbino 
Tioco, four parcels of land, described in the instrument. The defendant Felix 
paid, at the time of the execution of the deed, the sum of P3,000 on account of 
the purchase price, and bound herself to pay the remainder in installments, the 
first of P2,000 on July 15, 1914, the second of P5,000 thirty days after the 
issuance to her of a certificate of title under the Land Registration Act, and 
further, within ten years from the date of such title, P10 for each cocoanut 
tree in bearing and "P5 for each such tree not in bearing, that might be growing 
on said four parcels of land on the date of the issuance of title to her, with 
the condition that the total price should not exceed P85,000. It was further 
stipulated that the purchaser was to deliver to the vendor 25 per centum of the 
value of the products that she might obtain from the four parcels "from the 
moment she takes possession of them until the Torrens certificate of title be 
issued in her favor."
<p>It was also covenanted that "within one year from the date of the certificate 
of title in favor of Marciana Felix, this latter may rescind the present 
contract of purchase and sale, in which case Marcianar'Felix shall be obliged to 
return to me, A. A. Addison, the net value of all the products of the four 
parcels sold, and I shall be obliged to return to her, Marciana Felix, all the 
sums that she may have paid me, together with interest at the rate of 10 per 
cent per annum."</p>
<p>In January, 1915, the vendor, A. A. Addison, filed suit in the Court of First 
Instance of Manila to compel Marciana Felix to make payment of the first 
installment of P2,000, demandable, in accordance with the terms of the contract 
of sale aforementioned, on July 15, 1914, and of the interest in arrears, at the 
stipulated rate of 8 per cent per annum. The defendant,, jointly with her 
husband, answered the complaint and alleged by way of special defense that the 
plaintiff had absolutely failed to deliver to the defendant the lands that were 
the subject matter of the sale, notwithstanding the demands made upon him for 
this purpose. She therefore asked that she be absolved from the complaint, and 
that, after a declaration of the rescission of the contract of the purchase and 
sale of saidjands, the plaintiff be ordered refund the P3,000 that had been paid 
to him on account, together with the interest agreed upon, and to pay an 
indemnity for the losses and damages which the defendant alleged she had 
suffered through the plaintiff's nonfulfilment of the contract.</p>
<p>The evidence adduced shows that after the execution of the deed of sale the 
plaintiff, at the request of the purchaser, went to Lucena, accompanied by a 
representative of the latter, for the purpose of designating and delivering the 
lands sold. He was able to designate only two of the four parcels, and more than 
two-thirds of these two were found to be in the possession of one Juan 
Villafuerte, who claimed to be the owner of the parts so occupied by him. The 
plaintiff admitted that the purchaser would have to bring suit to obtain 
possession of the land (sten. notes, record, p. 5). In August, 1914, the 
surveyor Santamaria went to Lucena, at the request of the plaintiff and 
accompanied by him, in order to survey the land sold to the defendant; but he 
surveyed only two parcels, which are those occupied mainly by the brothers Leon 
and Julio Villafuerte. He did not survey the other parcels, as they were not 
designated to him by the plaintiff. In order to make this survey it was 
necessary to obtain from the Land Court a writ of injunction against the 
occupants, and for the purpose of the issuance of this'writ the defendant, in 
June, 1914, filed an application with the Land Court for the registration in her 
name of the four parcels of land described in the deed of sale executed in her 
favor by the plaintiff. The proceedings in the matter of this application were 
subsequently dismissed, for failure to present the required plans within the 
period of the time allowed for the purpose.</p>
<p>The trial court rendered judgment in behalf of the defendant holding the 
contract of sale to be rescinded and ordering the return to the plaintiff of the 
P3,000 paid on account of the price, together with interest thereon at the rate 
of 10 per cent per annum. From this judgment the plaintiff appealed.</p>
<p>In decreeing the rescission of the contract, the trial judge rested his 
conclusion solely on the indisputable fact that up to that time the lands sold 
had not been registered in accordance with the Torrens system, and on the terms 
of the second paragraph of clause (<em>h</em>) of the contract, whereby it is 
stipulated that "* * * within one year from the date of the certificate of title 
in favor of Marciana Felix, this latter may rescind the present contract of 
purchase and sale * * *."</p>
<p>The appellant objects, and rightly, that the cross complaint is not founded 
on the hypothesis of the conventional rescission relied upon by the court, but 
on the failure to deliver the land sold. He argues that the right to rescind the 
contract by virtue of the special agreement not only did not exist from the 
moment of the execution of the contract up to one year after the registration of 
the land, but does not <em>accrue</em> until the land is registered. The wording 
of the clause, in fact, substantiates the contention. The one year's 
deliberation granted to the purchaser was to be counted "from the date of the 
certificate of title * * *." Therefore the right to elect to rescind the 
contract was subject to a condition, namely, the issuance of the title. The 
record shows that up to the present time that condition has not been fulfilled; 
consequently the defendant cannot be heard to invoke a right which depends on 
the existence of that condition. If in the cross-complaint it had been alleged 
that the fulfillment of the condition was impossible for reasons imputable to 
the plaintiff, and if this allegation had been proven, perhaps the condition 
would have been considered as fulfilled (arts, 1117, 1118, and 1119, Civ. Code); 
but this issue was not presented in the defendant's answer.</p>
<p>However, although we are not in agreement with the reasoning found in the 
decision appealed from, we consider it to be correct in its result. The record 
shows that the plaintiff did not deliver the thing sold. With respect to two of 
the parcels of land, he was not even able to show them to the purchaser; and as 
regards the other two, more than two-thirds of their area was in the hostile and 
adverse possession of a third person.</p>
<p>The Code imposes upon the vendor the obligation to <em>deliver</em> the thing 
sold. The thing is considered to be delivered when it is placed "in the hands 
and possession of the vendee." (Civ. Code, art. 1462.) It is true that the same 
article declares that the execution of a public instrument is equivalent to the 
delivery of the thing which is the object of the contract, but, in order that 
this symbolic delivery may produce the effect of tradition, it is necessary that 
the vendor shall have had such <em>control</em> over the thing sold that, at the 
moment of the sale, its material delivery could have been made. It is not enough 
to confer upon the purchaser the <em>ownership</em> and the <em>right</em> of 
possession. The thing sold must be placed in his <em>control</em>. When there is 
no impediment whatever to prevent the thing sold passing into the tenancy of the 
purchaser by the sole will of the vendor, symbolic delivery through the 
execution of a public instrument is sufficient. But if, notwithstanding the 
execution of the instrument, the purchaser cannot have the enjoyment and 
material tenancy of the thing and make use of it himself or through another in 
his name, because such tenancy and enjoyment are opposed by the interposition of 
another will, then fiction yields to reality—the delivery has not been 
effected.</p>
<p>As Dalloz rightly says (Gen. Rep., vol. 43, p. 174) in his commentaries on 
article 1604 of the French Civil Code, "the word 'delivery' expresses a complex 
idea * * * the abandonment of the thing by the person who makes the delivery and 
the taking control of it by the person to whom the delivery is made."</p>
<p>The execution of a public instrument is sufficient for the purposes of the 
abandonment made by the vendor, but it is not always sufficient to permit of the 
apprehension of the thing by the purchaser.</p>
<p>The supreme court of Spain, interpreting article 1462 of the Civil Code, held 
in its decision of November 10, 19Q3, (Civ. Rep., vol. 96, p. 560) that this 
article "merely declares that when the sale is made through the means of a 
public instrument, the execution of this latter is equivalent to the delivery of 
the thing sold: which does not and cannot mean that this fictitious tradition 
necessarily implies the real tradition of the thing sold, for it is 
incontrovertible that, while its ownership still pertains to the vendor (and 
with greater reason if it does not), a third person may be in possession of the 
same thing; wherefore, though, as a general rule, he who purchases by means of a 
public instrument should be deemed * * * to be the possessor in fact, yet this 
presumption gives way before proof to the contrary."</p>
<p>It is evident, then, in the case at bar, that the mere execution of the 
instrument was not a fulfillment of the vendor's obligation to deliver the thing 
sold, and. that from such nonfulfillment arises the purchaser's right to demand, 
as she has demanded, the rescission of the sale and the return of the price. 
(Civ. Code, arts. 1506 and 1124.)</p>
<p>Of course if the sale had been made under the express agreement of imposing 
upon the purchaser the obligation to take the necessary steps to pbtain the 
material possession of the thing sold, and it were proven that she knew that the 
thing was in the possession of a third person claiming to have property rights 
therein, such agreement would be perfectly valid. But there is nothing in the 
instrument which would indicate, even implicitly, that such was the agreement. 
It,is true, as the appellant argues, that the obligation was ineumbent upon the 
defendant Marciana Felix to apply for and obtain the registration of the land in 
the new registry of property; but from this it cannot be concluded that she had 
to await the final decision of the Court of Land Registration, in order to be 
able to enjoy the property sold. On the contrary, it was expressly stipulated in 
the contract that the purchaser should deliver to the vendor one-fourth "of the 
products * * * of the aforesaid four parcels from the moment when she takes 
possession of them until the Torrens certificate of title be issued in her 
favor." This obviously shows that it was not foreseen that the purchaser might 
be deprived of her possession during the course of the registration proceedings, 
but that the transaction rested on the assumption that she was to have, during 
said period, the material possession and enjoyment of the <em>four parcels of 
land</em>.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as the rescission is made by virtue of the provisions of law and not 
by contractual agreement, it is not the conventional but the legal interest that 
is demandable.</p>
<p>It is therefore held that the contract of purchase and sale entered into by 
and between the plaintiff and the defendant on June 11,1914, is rescinded, and 
the plaintiff is ordered to make restitution of tlie sum of P3,000 received by 
him on account of the price of the sale, together with interest thereon at the 
legal rate of 6 per cent per annum from the date of the filing of the complaint 
until payment, with the costs of both instances against the appellant So 
ordered.</p>
