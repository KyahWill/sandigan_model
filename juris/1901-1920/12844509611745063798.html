				G.R. No. 9487, September 04, 1917</h4>

				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The purpose of the present action was to recover rents due and unpaid for the 
use and occupation of certain property described in the complaint, together with 
a certain sum due as taxes, which, it is claimed, the defendant promised to pay 
under the contract of rent. The action was commenced in the Court of First 
Instance of the city of Manila in the month of March, 1908. On the 25th day of 
November, 1909, the respective parties entered into an agreement or stipulation 
of facts. Upon said stipulation of facts the case was finally submitted to the 
court, and a judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiffs and against the 
defendant for the sum of P3,063.65, with interest at 6 per cent from the 15th 
day of March, 1908, and costs. From that judgment the defendant appealed.
<p>The record was received in the Supreme Court upon the 4th day of October, 
1912, and the case was finally submitted for decision upon the 6th day of 
August, 1917.</p>
<p>The amount mentioned in the judgment of the trial court was composed of two 
items: (<em>a</em>) the sum of P1,900, the balance of the rent due and unpaid, 
(<em>b</em>) the sum of P1,163.65, an amount alleged to be due as a portion of 
the taxes which the defendant promised to pay upon the rented property.</p>
<p>An examination of the facts agreed upon and upon which the decision was 
finally based, shows that the defendant acknowledged that there was still due 
and unpaid under the contract of rent the sum of P1,900 as rent. Said agreement 
further shows that the defendant promised to pay a proportional amount of the 
taxes on said property. Said agreement fails, however, to show what was the 
amount of said taxes which the defendant agreed to pay. Said agreement as to the 
facts is the only proof presented to the court below. There being no proof of 
the amount of said taxes due and payable, we are unable to render a judgment for 
any amount covering that item.</p>
<p>In view, therefore, of the admission of the defendant that she owed to the 
plaintiff the sum of P1,900, and in view of the fact that there was no proof 
adduced during the trial of the cause showing the amount of the taxes which she 
promised to pay, the judgment of the lower court must be modified and the sum of 
P1,163.65 must be eliminated from said judgment. With that modification, the 
judgment of the lower court is hereby affirmed, with- out any finding of costs 
in this instance. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Carson, Araullo, Street</em>, and <em>Malcolm, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p></div>
