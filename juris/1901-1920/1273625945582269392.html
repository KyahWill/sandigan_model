				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The subject of Specific Performance, with reference to its common law and 
civil law status, is to be considered on this appeal. The particular action is 
for the specific performance of a contract for the sale and purchase of real 
estate.
<p>The plaintiff is the owner of a certain parcel of realty consisting of 
2,695.24 square meters, situated in the city, of Manila, and fully described in 
the complaint. About the month of December, 1916, the defendants made a 
proposition to the plaintiff for the purchase of this property. After 
negotiating for some time, it was agreed that the defendants would pay plaintiff 
the sum of "P10,000 for the land, P2,000 of which was to be handed over upon the 
signing of the deed, and the balance of P8,000, paid in monthly installments of 
P150. The property was to be mortgaged to the-plaintiff to secure the payment of 
this balance of P8,000. The plaintiff proceeded to have survey made of the land 
and to prepare the deed and mortgage. Expenses to the amount of P83.93 were 
incurred for these purposes. The deed was ready about December 28, 1916, when 
the defendants were notified to appear and sign the same. They failed to do 
this, and instead, the defendant, Patrocinio R. Afzelius, wrote a letter to 
plaintiff, as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p align="right">'Manila, <em>January 3, 1917</em>.</p>"Mr. Francisco 
Gutierrez,<br>"<em>Manila</em>.

<p>"My Dear Sir : It is with regret that I inform you that it is now absolutely 
impossible for us to effect the purchase of the property at Juan Luna Street, as 
it was our desire to do. The reason for this is that the business has failed, in 
which we had invested all the money we had and from which we hoped to obtain 
sure gains and to get the P2,000 which we were to give you in advance for the 
purchase of said property, and consequently, we have lost our savings and our 
hope of being able to purchase the property for the time being.</p>
<p>"Before closing, I request you to pardon us for the troubles we have caused 
you, for, in truth, we acted in good faith, but, as you will readily realize, 
without having the P2,000 in our hands, it will be impossible for us to effect 
the purchase.</p>
<p>"Reiterating my request that you pardon us for all the trouble, I am</p>
<p align="right">"Very truly yours.<br>(Sgd.) "Patrocinio R. Afzelius."</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition to the letter above quoted, Afzelius testified on the trial that 
although he and his wife had available the sum of P2,000 to pay the first 
installment on the purchase price of the land, yet it belonged in part to his 
wife's sister, and that, as she subsequently needed the money for something 
else, they had to return it to her, and in. order to give excuses to the 
plaintiff, his wife wrote this letter to the plaintiff.</p>
<p>Plaintiff was, and still is, willing to execute the deed in accordance with 
the terms agreed upon with the defendants. Accordingly, plaintiff, in his action 
in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, asked judgment against the 
defendants condemning them to sign the deed and mortgage to the land in 
question, and to pay the purchase price stipulated, with costs. The defendants 
filed a general denial, alleging that the plaintiff has not sustained damages of 
any kind or character, and praying that the case be dismissed at the cost of the 
plaintiff. The trial court, after finding the facts as herein stated, made 
application thereto of the law of Specific Performance. After stating the 
general principles of this branch of the law, the court deduced therefrom that 
the remedy by specific performance is one the granting or denying of which rests 
in the exercise of sound judicial discretion. The court said:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Whether or not the defendants are able to perform the contract is a matter 
of defense, and there is no special defense on that subject in the answer; but 
it appears from the evidence that the defendants have not the funds available 
for the cash payment on the contract, and apparently the performance of the 
contract in the terms agreed between the plaintiff and defendants would be 
impracticable; the court would not be able to enforce a decree for specific 
performance, and such a decree might operate as a great hardship upon the 
defendants; therefore, the court is of the opinion that it would be useless, 
unjust and inequitable to render judgment herein for specific performance."</p></blockquote>
<p>The judgment then was in favor of the defendants, dismissing the plaintiff's 
complaint, without prejudice to any other remedy which the plaintiff might have, 
and without any finding as to the costs.</p>
<p>The plaintiff and appellant bases his argument on articles 1254, 1258, 1278, 
1450, and 1279 of the Civil Code. The provisions of the five articles first 
cited and others that could be mentioned merely tend to corroborate what is 
self-evident, namely, the existence of a valid contract between the parties. 
Indisputably, there has been an offer and an acceptance, and all that remained 
to effectuate the contract was the execution of the deed and the mortgage.</p>
<p>The article of the Civil Code chiefly relied upon by appellant, No. 1279, 
would seem to settle favorably the first branch of the prayer of the complaint, 
asking that the defendants be required to sign the deed and mortgage to the land 
in question. This article of the Civil Code appears to have been prepared to 
meet exactly such a situation, to the end that the contracting parties can 
reciprocally compel the observance of the necessary formalities.</p>
<p>Other portions of the Civil Code not called to our attention by the 
appellant, notably articles 1096, 1098, 1124, and 1451, recognize what is 
denominated in the common law as Specific Performance. Article 1451 provides 
that, "A promise to sell or buy, when there is an agreement as to the thing and 
the price, entitles the contracting parties reciprocally to demand the 
fulfilment of the contract." But the article in recognition of a negative result 
also provides, "whenever the promise to purchase and sell cannot be fulfilled, 
the provisions relative to obligations and contracts, contained in this book, 
shall be applicable in the respective cases to the vendor and the vendee." 
Turning to these provisions relating to obligations and contracts, we find 
article 1096 making a distinction between a specific thing to be delivered and 
an indeterminate or generic thing; article 1098 providing that a person is 
obligated to do a certain thing according to the tenor of the obligation; and 
finally, article 1124 in absolute approval of contractual mutuality decreeing 
that "the person prejudiced may choose between exacting the fulfillment of the 
obligation or its resolution with indemnity for damages and payment of interest 
in either cases."</p>
<p>As to whether the vendor can compel the vendee to perform, which is the point 
before the court, the jurisprudence of the supreme court of Spain and the 
commentaries of Manresa do not in the least attempt to distinguish between one 
or the other party, the vendor or the vendee, but constantly and without 
exception use the word "reciprocamente." The following decisions of the supreme 
court of Spain interpretative of these articles can be noted: April 17, 1897; 
October 10, 1904; February 4, 1905.</p>
<p>The vendee is entitled to specific performance essentially as a matter of 
course. Philippine cases have so held. (Irureta Goyena <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Tambunting [1902], 1 
Phil, 490; Thunga Chui <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Que Bentec [1903], 2 Phil., 561; Couto Soriano <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. 
Cortes [1907], 8 Phil., 459; Dievas <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Co Chongco [1910], 16 Phil., 447.) If 
the doctrine of mutuality of remedy is to apply, the vendor should likewise be 
entitled to similar relief . Philippine jurisprudence, however, has never as 
yet been afforded an opportunity to so hold. The nearest approach to the idea 
has been, with reference to merchandise, in a decision to the effect that if the 
purchaser of merchandise refuses without lawful reason to accept delivery when 
tendered by the seller in conformity with the contract of sale, the seller may 
elect to enforce compliance or to rescind. (Matute <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Cheong Boo [1918], 37 
Phil., 372.)</p>
<p>Thus far, in this opinion we have discussed the question of whether the 
vendor as well as the vendee is entitled to the specific performance of the 
contract for the sale of land, from the standpoint of the civil law. Now, of 
course, specific performance of contracts is, under this name, an equitable 
remedy. As such, since there exist no courts of equity and no equity 
jurisprudence in this jurisdiction, the authority arising from the common law is 
not of binding force in the Philippines. Nevertheless, as the civil law and the 
common law seem to arrive at the same goal on this subject, we should at least 
notice as persuasive authority the jurisprudence of the United States and Great 
Britain.</p>
<p>The American and English cases that relate to specific performance by the 
vendor are with a few exceptions all one way. In the language of Chief Justice 
Marshall, "The right of a vendor to come into a court of equity to enforce a 
specific performance is unquestionable." (Cathcart <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Robinson [1831], 5 Pet., 
264.) The rule in nearly all jurisdictions is that specific performance may be 
had at the suit of the vendor of land, the vendee being decreed to accept the 
deed and pay the purchase price. (Freeman <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Paulson [1909], 107 Minn., 64; 
Migatz <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Stieglitz [1905], 166 Ind., 362; Robinson <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Appleton [1888], 124 
111., 276; Hodges <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Kowing [1889], 58 Conn., 12; Curtis Land &amp; Loan Co. 
<span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Interior Land Co. [1908], 137 Wis., 341; The Maryland Clay Co. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Simpers 
[1903], 96 Md., 1; Old Colony R. Corp. vs. Evans [1856], 6 Gray, 25; Raymond <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. 
San Gabriel etc. Co. [1893], 53 Fed., 883; 36 Cyc, 565.) The reasoning 
supporting the authorities is that the performance of contracts must and should 
be mutual. The contract is ordinarily bilateral. So should the respective rights 
of the parties be. Nor does an action to recover damages for breach of contract 
ordinarily afford a complete and adequate remedy. The equitable doctrine is not 
applied where it will be productive of great hardship.</p>
<p>Here we have presented a good and valid contract, bilateral in character, and 
free from all taint of fraud. The stability of commercial transactions requires 
that the rights of the seller be protected just as effectively as the rights of 
the buyer. If this plaintiff had refused to comply with the contract, specific 
performance of the obligation could have been asked by the defendants. Just as 
surely should the plaintiff who has lived up to his bargain and who has been put 
to expense to do so, be permitted to coerce the defendant into going through 
with the contract.</p>
<p>The excuse of the defendants is that they do not now have the money to pay 
the first installment. In other words, they plead impossibility of performance. 
The rule of equity jurisprudence in such a case is that mere pecuniary inability 
to fulfill an engagement does not discharge the obligation of the contract, nor 
does it constitute any defense to a decree for specific performance. (Hopper <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. 
Hopper [1863], 16 N. J. Eq., 147.) Now, the courts will not make an order 
obviously nugatory. But the courts should lend their assistance to the plaintiff 
to compel the defendants to fulfill their obligation. Besides requiring the 
defendants to sign the contract and the mortgage, the judgment of the court can 
be aided by execution on the property of the defendants. If, then, it is found 
that it is impossible for the defendants to live up to their agreement, 
naturally the plaintiff will rest content if for no other reason than for the 
protection of his financial interests.</p>
<p>Judgment shall be reversed, and an order shall issue, condemning the 
defendants to sign the deed and mortgage to the land in question and to pay the 
first installment of the purchase price as stipulated.</p>
<p>The appellant shall recover costs of both instances. The Code of Civil 
Procedure in its Chapter XXI entitled "Costs in the Several Courts" states in 
section 487 that "Costs shall ordinarily be allowed to the prevailing party as a 
matter of course * * *." Philippine law is, in this respect, identical with the 
general rule, which is that "On reversal, * * * the costs will generally go to 
the prevailing party, that is, to' the appellant." (7 R. C. L., 801, citing 
cases.) No special reasons exist in this case for modifying the general rule. So 
ordered.</p>
<p><em>Johnson, Street, Avanceña</em>, and <em>Fisher, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>

<p align="center"><em><strong>CONCURRING OPINION</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>TORRES, J.</strong>, <em>concurring:</em></p>
<p>The undersigned concurs in the result, but nevertheless believes that all the 
costs of this action and half of those of the first ought to be paid by the 
defendants.</p>
<p>The reasons upon which the reversal of the judgment is based are those 
prescribed by section 487 of Act No. 190 whereby the costs are allowed to the 
prevailing party who, for good cause, appealed and obtained the reversal of the 
judgment, so in accordance with law the plaintiff should not pay the costs of 
both instances, but a part or half only of the costs of the first 
instance.</p></div>
