				G.R. No. 1599, June 01, 1906</h4>
				<H3>THE  CITY OF  MANILA,  PLAINTIFF  AND APPELLANT, VS.  LEONARDA SALGADO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On the 18th of July,  1902, the city of  Manila brought this action to recover a tract  of land of which the defendant was then in possession, alleging that it was the owner of the same, and further, to recover  the sum  of 15,000 dollars, United States currency, damages for the wrongful occupation of the land, by the defendant and her father.</p>
<p>It is  alleged in paragraph  2 of the  complaint that the father of the defendant had been in possession of the land in  question from the 28th of February,  1869,  when  he instituted possessory information proceedings before the authorities of the district of Santa Cruz, where the land is situated, in accordance with the practice at that time. These proceedings were subsequently recorded in the office of one of the clerks of court of the city of Manila.</p>
<p>It will be noted that it is alleged in the complaint that the defendant had been in the adverse  possession of the land under claim of ownership for more  than thirty years.</p>
<p>The defendant has  confirmed  this allegation  by  documentary proof,  which, considered even  as a foundation, supported as it is by parol evidence from which it appears that such possession had continued for not less than forty-five years, shows not only this fact but a right of possession now supported  by a  title of heriditary  succession,  the derivation  and  transmission of which  have also been admitted in paragraph 3 of the complaint.</p>
<p>The city of Manila  has  not proved that it has been in possession of the land claimed at any time whatever, nor has it proved that it  has a better right  to the possession of  the land  than the defendant, and  much less has it proved that it has any  title  to the property.  The only proof offered by the plaintiff city is evidence to the effect that it has opened streets through that  vicinity and a number of legal provisions enacted  by the former Board of the city of Manila in regard  to taxation,  which were properly rejected by the court below as immaterial to the issue.</p>
<p>The judgment of the court below whereby the action of the plaintiff was  dismissed with costs  is in conformity with  the law, and is therefore hereby affirmed in  all respects, with the costs of this instance against the  appellant, and after the expiration  of twenty days  let judgment  be entered in Accordance  herewith and  ten  days thereafter the record be remanded to the court below  for execution.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Mapa, Johnson, </em>and <em>Carson, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
