				<H3>THE UNITED STATES,  COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE, VS. PRAXIDIO  PENOSO, DEFENDANT  AND  APPELLANT.
  
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> In the Court of First Instance of Ambos Camarines on the 17th day of January, 1901, the defendant was convicted of the crime of sedition defined in article 8 of Act No. 292.  He appealed.</p>
<p> In his brief, filed in this court on November 29, 1902, he asked that he be acquitted, but if the court was of the opinion that this could not be done, then he asked that he be included in the amnesty of July 4, 1902.</p>
<p> Afterwards, and on January 8, 1903, he joined with the Solicitor-General  in a petition  to the  court  that he be declared entitled to the benefit of said amnesty.</p>
<p> We are justified, under these circumstances, in not passing upon  the  merits  of  the case.   (The United  States vs. Santillana, decided November 10, 1902.)</p>
<p> The offense is clearly included in the amnesty proclamation of July 4, 1902.   The acts  charged were committed in  the month  of  December,  1901.  If proved, they  constituted  an offense  under Act No. 292, section 8  of the Commission. All offenses included in that Act are covered by the amnesty.   (The United  States vs. Abad, decided October  22, 1902.)   It is certainly  clear that offenses included in section 8 of the Act are so covered.</p>
<p> It is therefore declared that  the defendant is. entitled to the benefits of the amnesty, and upon his filing in this court the required oath the case shall  be dismissed and remanded to the court below with direction that defendant be discharged.  So ordered.</p>
<p> <em>Arellano, C.  J., Torres, Cooper,</em> and <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p> <em>Mapa, J.,</em> did not sit in this case.</p>
