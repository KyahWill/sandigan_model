				<H3>LEOPOLDO FERRER, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. RAMON NERI ABEJUELA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>According to the last amended complaint,  this action was brought by Leopoldo Ferrer, as the legal representative of his minor children,  Vicenta, Amparo, and Enrique Ferrer y Moreno.</p>
<p>On the 16th day of November, 1895, the defendant borrowed of Leopoldo Ferrer, the legal representative of his minor children, Vicenta, Amparo, and Enrique Ferrer y Moreno, 2,100 pesos.   The purpose  of the action was to recover the amount due upon the written  agreement  evidencing that loan.</p>
<p>The defendant claims that at the trial in the court below it appeared from the testimony of Leopoldo Ferrer that the money thus borrowed  by  the defendant  from these minor children in fact  belonged to the  conjugal  partnership formerly existing  between Leopoldo  Ferrer and his wife.</p>
<p>It is seen that this action is brought by the very persons who are named in the  document of 1895  as the persons from whom the defendant borrowed the money.   The court below held that the testimony above referred to, given by Leopoldo Ferrer, was of no importance,  saying:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"He [the defendant] must return the money to the person with whom he contracted."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This holding is in conformity with the rule of this court in the case of Dougherty <em>vs</em>.  Evangelista  (7  Phil. Rep., 37).  It was there said, at page 39:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"We consider that it is not open to the defendant, when the day of payment has come, to challenge the right which he did not question at  the  time of borrowing.   From  the Roman  Catholic bishop of Nueva  Segovia he took  the money, and to the  Roman  Catholic  bishop of Nueva  Segovia he must repay it,  whatever may have been the title under which the latter held  the funds of the <em>cofradia</em>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The defendant in the court below moved for a new trial on  the ground that  the evidence did not justify the decision.  He now claims that this court has no right to review all the evidence, but only such part thereof as he saw fit to mention in his bill  of  exceptions.   His claim  is that we must decide the case upon the oral testimony given by Leopoldo Ferrer,  and that we can not consider the document. which was received  in  evidence.</p>
<p>The  appellant says  that the only evidence which  he mentioned in  the bill of exceptions was this testimony of Leopoldo Ferrer, and that it was the duty of the appellee, if he wished the other  evidence to be brought  before this court, to procure an amendment of the bill  of  exceptions.</p>
<p>It  is  apparent  that  no  such claim can  be  sustained. It is the duty  of the appellant, and not of the appellee, to prepare a  bill  of exceptions.  If the appellant wishes this court to review the evidence introduced at the trial below, it is his business to see  that all of that evidence is brought here.  He can not bring a part of  it here and claim a reversal on the ground that the evidence so presented to this court does not support  the judgment.</p>
<p>The judgment of  the court below is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the  appellant.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson, Carson,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ., </em>concur.<br>
