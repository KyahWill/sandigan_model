				<H3>CARLOS PALANCA, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. FRED WILSON & CO., DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">As the culmination of negotiations, on June 11, 1913, Song Fo &amp; Co., of 
Manila, through its manager Carlos Palanca, entered into a contract with Fred 
Wilson &amp; Co. for the purchase of a distilling apparatus for P10,000. Wilson 
&amp; Co. ordered the apparatus of Turner, Schon &amp; Co., London, installing 
it in January, 1914. On May 18, 1914, or about five months after the machine was 
installed, Palanca wrote Wilson &amp; Co. that the rectifying machine had been 
examined by a number of competent persons who stated that the machine was not 
capable of producing the amount of alcohol stipulated in the contract. Getting 
no satisfaction from the reply of Wilson &amp; Co., action for damages for 
breach of contract was begun in the Court of First Instance of the city of 
Manila, praying first that the defendant be ordered to comply strictly with the 
terms of the contract and second that the defendant be ordered to pay as damages 
the amount of P16,713.80.
<p>Defendant answered with a general denial and a cross-complaint asking 
judgment against the plaintiff in the sum of P5,000, the final installment 
claimed to be due as the purchase price of the machine. By the judgment handed 
down by the Honorable James A. Ostrand, judge of first instance, it was ordered 
that the plaintiff take nothing by his action, and that the defendant have and 
recovered judgment against the plaintiff for the sum of P5,000, with interest 
thereon at the rate of 12 per cent per annum from the first day of September, 
1914, without special finding as to costs.</p>
<p>It is around the first clause of the contract (Exhibit D) that all the 
argument centers. This clause reads: "Un aparato 'Guillaume' para la 
destilacion-rectificacion directa y continua; tipo 'C,' Agricola, de una 
capacidad de 6,000 litros cada 24 horas de trabajo, de un grado de 96-97 Gay 
Lussac, todo segun el grabado de la pagina 30 del catalogo Egrot, edici6n de 
1907." We believe in the first place, that it is undeniable from the evidence, 
that the apparatus in question, while it could treat 6,000 liters of raw 
material a day, did not produce 6,000 liters a day, but on the contrary only 
something over 480 liters a day of rectified alcohol of the required grade. This 
being true, appellant vigorously asserts that there has been a breach of the 
contract in that instead of the machine having a capacity of 6,000 liters for 
every 24 hours of work, it only had (a producing) capacity of 480 liters for 
this period of time. Appellant would require that all the terms of the contract 
be given effect with special emphasis upon the phrase "de un grado de 96-97 Gay 
Lussac." This last phrase in connection with the previous one "de una capacidad 
de 6,000 litros cada 24 horas de trabajo" according ta appellant could not 
possibly mean that the machine was only to take in 6,000 liters for this would 
be improbable in view of the express mention of the grade of the product. 
Appellee on the other hand relies on the ordinary meaning of the word "capacity" 
as indicating receptivity and on the preliminary negotiations as explaining the 
intention of the parties. The evidence is of little assistance in resolving the 
question. Thus, Carlos Palanca, the manager of Song Fo &amp; Co., and now the 
successor of the company, testified that he told the agents of Wilson &amp; Co. 
<em>that he need a machine that would produce at least 6,000 liters of alcohol a 
day</em>. The agent of Wilson &amp; Co., James F. Loader, squarely contradicted 
this on the stand and said <em>that Palanca asked him to get a price on an 
apparatus to treat 6,000 liters</em>.</p>
<p>Beginning anew, in order to reach a proper conclusion as to the meaning of 
clause one of the contract, we approach the subject from two directions. Under 
the first view, we take up the meaning of the words themselves. Under the 
second, believing that it is necessary to explain intrinsic ambiguity in the 
contract, we can go, as we are permitted to do under chapter IV title II, book 
IV of the Civil Code, and chapter X of the Code of Civil Procedure, especially 
section 285, to evidence of the circumstances under which the agreement was 
made.</p>
<p>The terms of the contract disclose the following essential constituents: (1) 
A machine Guillaume, type "C" (Agricola) as described on page 30 of the 
Catalogue Egrot, edition of 1907; (2) a machine of a capacity of 6,000 liters 
for every 24 hours of work, and (3) a machine producing alcohol of a grade 96-97 
Gay Lussac. Type C (Agricola) as described on pages 30 and 31 of the catalogue 
mentions the grade of alcohol guaranteed of 96-97 Gay Lussac, but contains no 
mention of a capacity of 6,000 liters a day. Passing the second element for the 
moment, there is no dispute in the record, or more properly speaking the 
plaintiff did not prove, that the machine did not turn out alcohol of the grade 
96-97 Gay Lussac. Predicated therefore on the description to be found in the 
catalogue, it is plain that the defendant sold to the plaintiff the machine 
there mentioned. This leaves for interpretation the one word "capacity."</p>
<p>That in connection with the distilling of liquor, the word "capacity" may 
have different meanings unless restricted in terminology, is disclosed by the 
decision of the United States Supreme Court in Chicago Distilling Co. 
<em>vs</em>. Stone ([1891] 140 U. S., 647), where the qualifying phrases 
"working capacity" and "producing capacity' are specifically" mentioned. The 
ordinary meaning of the word is denned in the English Dictionaries as "ability 
to receive or contain; cubic extent; carrying power or space; said of that 
within which any solid or fluid may be placed, and also used figuratively; as 
the keg has a <em>capacity</em> of 10 gallons; the ship's capacity is 1,000 
tons." The ordinary meaning of the Spanish equivalent "capacidad" as disclosed 
by the Spanish dictionaries is "ambito que tiene alguna cosa y es suficiente 
para contener en si otra; como el de una vasija, area, etc. En el vaso se debe 
atender la disposicion y capacidad." Both definitions denote that which anything 
can receive or contain.</p>
<p>We think, however, that it can be laid down as a premise for further 
discussion that there is intrinsic ambiguity in the contract which needs 
explanation. Section 285 of the Code of Civil Procedure providing that a written 
agreement shall be presumed to contain all the terms, nevertheless "does not 
exclude other evidence of the circumstances under which the agreement was made, 
or to which it relates, or to explain an intrinsic ambiguity." Turning, 
therefore, to the surrounding circumstances, we find the following: Wilson &amp; 
Co. in their offer to Song Fo &amp; Co. on June 9, 1913, while mentioning 
capacity, only did so in express connection with the name and description of the 
machine as illustrated in the catalogue. They furnished Song Fo &amp; Co. with 
plans and specifications of the distilling apparatus; and these describe a 
capacity of 6,000 liters of <em>jus</em> (ferment). Wilson &amp; Co.'s order to 
manufacturer, while mentioning a capacity of 6,000 liters per day, does so again 
in connection with the description in the maker's catalogue. And, finally, it 
was stated during the trial, and it has not been denied, that a machine capable 
of producing 6,000 liters of rectified alcohol every 24 hours from nipa ferment 
would cost between P35,000 and P40,000.</p>
<p>We are accordingly constrained to hold that the proper construction of clause 
1 of the contract, in question in connection with the conduct of the parties and 
surrounding circumstances, is that Wilson &amp; Co. were to furnish Song Fo 
&amp; Co. a distilling apparatus, type C (Agricola), as described on page 30 of 
the maker's catalogue, capable of receiving or treating 6,000 liters every 24 
hours of work and of producing alcohol of a grade 96-97 Gay Lussac.</p>
<p>We conclude that the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed without 
special finding as to costs. So ordered.</p>
