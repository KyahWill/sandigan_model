				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On&nbsp; September&nbsp; 7,&nbsp; 1907, Ricardo Nolan filed&nbsp; an amended complaint&nbsp; in the Court of First&nbsp; Instance of&nbsp; Occidental Negros against Emilio Escay and Cristeta Gonzaga, alleging that by means of an instrument ratified on the 6th of June, 1903, the defendant Escay acknowleged that he was owing the&nbsp; Compania&nbsp; General de Tabacos&nbsp; de Filipinas the sum of P22,086.43, with&nbsp; interest at 9&nbsp; per cent per annum, and he bound himself to pay it, together with the interest,&nbsp; on or before the 1st day of March, 1905; that in order to guarantee the payment of the said sum and the interest due thereon, the defendant debtor executed a lien on the hacienda called&nbsp; Lanoglanog,&nbsp; now&nbsp; known&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; name&nbsp; of Teresa, and&nbsp; on&nbsp; all&nbsp; the buildings, machinery, and other appurtenances thereof, and, further, on a house of strong materials,&nbsp; the property of defendant's wife,&nbsp; Cristeta Gonzaga, who conferred&nbsp; upon her&nbsp; husband power&nbsp; for this purpose; that the instrument above referred to set forth the location of the said house and the area,&nbsp; the metes and&nbsp; bounds&nbsp; of the land; that the said Hacienda&nbsp; Teresa&nbsp; is situated in the pueblo of Saravia and has the area and boundaries mentioned in the complaint; that on the&nbsp; 30th of June,&nbsp; 1905, the defendant Escay, while still living, was owing the said company the sum of P29,824.43, with&nbsp; interest at 9 per cent per annum from&nbsp; the said date; that on&nbsp; the 25th&nbsp; of October of that year, Luis G. Espoy, the&nbsp; head of the Iloilo branch&nbsp; of the aforementioned company,&nbsp; delivered to Alejandro&nbsp; Montelibano y Ramos, among other&nbsp; credits,&nbsp; that of the defendant Escay,&nbsp; for collection; that, on&nbsp; the&nbsp; 3d&nbsp; of August, 1906, Vicente Muntadas, the head of the&nbsp; said Iloilo branch, transferred&nbsp; to the said Montelibano y Ramos, by a public instrument, all&nbsp; the rights&nbsp; and&nbsp; actions&nbsp; that pertained to the Compania&nbsp; General&nbsp; de&nbsp; Tabacos&nbsp; with respect to the&nbsp; said&nbsp; debt which&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant Escay still owed, together with the interest thereon&nbsp; from June&nbsp; 30, 1905; that by an&nbsp; instrument&nbsp; of&nbsp; the 20th&nbsp; of February,&nbsp; 1907, Montelibano&nbsp; y&nbsp; Ramos&nbsp; transferred to&nbsp; the plaintiff&nbsp; Nolan all his rights in&nbsp; the said credit against the defendant Escay, who was duly notified of the&nbsp; transfer made by the company of his&nbsp; debt in favor of Montelibano y&nbsp; Ramos and of the transfer effected by the latter in favor of the plaintiff Nolan;&nbsp; that,&nbsp; notwithstanding&nbsp; the demands, which several times were made to Escay for the payment of his debt, he had not paid the same in whole or in part, nor the interest thereon; that, one day in May,&nbsp; 1907, Emilio&nbsp; Escay died, and by an order issued by the judge of the Tenth District, on the&nbsp; 14th of August following, his&nbsp; widow, Cristeta Gonzaga, was&nbsp; appointed administratrix of his intestate&nbsp; estate, she having been duly sworn for&nbsp; the purpose on&nbsp; the 2d of September of the same year; that to the amended&nbsp; complaint is&nbsp; attached as&nbsp; a&nbsp; part&nbsp; thereof Exhibit&nbsp; 1,&nbsp; a&nbsp; copy&nbsp; of the public instrument of June 6, 1903, executed by the deceased Escay during his lifetime&nbsp; in favor of the&nbsp; said Compañia General de Tabacos; and that a&nbsp; copy of the present complaint has been filed with the land registry&nbsp; office&nbsp; of the province; and&nbsp; therefore this court is prayed to&nbsp; render a decision against Cristeta Gonzaga, personally&nbsp; and as the administratrix of the intestate estate of the deceased&nbsp; Escay, by ordering her to pay to the plaintiff the sum of P29,824.43, with interest thereon at the rate&nbsp; of 9 per cent per annum from the&nbsp; 30th of June,&nbsp; 1905, until its&nbsp; complete&nbsp; payment, and to&nbsp; pay the costs of the suit, and that, in case&nbsp; of insolvency, the sheriff proceed to sell the property given as security, or the part&nbsp; thereof that it&nbsp; be&nbsp; necessary to sell; and to&nbsp; provide any other just and adequate remedy.<br><br>The document Exhibit 1,&nbsp; which accompanies&nbsp; the complaint, is the instrument executed on the 6th of June, 1903, before the notary Gregorio Yulp, by Emilio Escay y Hernandez and Eduardo Cedrun, as the representative in Iloilo of the Compañia General de Tabacos, and it appears therein that, according to an instrument of the 30th of June, 1902, the said company granted to Emilio Escay a loan of 8,000 pesos,&nbsp; Mexican&nbsp; currency, wherewith&nbsp; to pay the&nbsp; expenses of the Hacienda Lanoglanog, belonging to him and situated within&nbsp; the&nbsp; district of Saravia, Island&nbsp; of Negros,&nbsp; which loan was made&nbsp; for a period of two&nbsp; years&nbsp; from&nbsp; the said date, with&nbsp; interest at 9 per&nbsp; cent per annum,&nbsp; and that&nbsp; as a guaranty and security for compliance with the obligation the debtor, Escay, mortgaged to the said company the said Hacienda&nbsp; Lanoglanog,&nbsp; subsequently called the Teresa,&nbsp; of 179 hectares&nbsp; in&nbsp; area, bounded as described therein, the same being provided with a warehouse of strong materials, a&nbsp; steam engine of&nbsp; 9 horsepower, a furnace and&nbsp; other appurtenances for the making of sugar; that, according to the settlement had on the 21st of March, it was found that Escay owed the creditor company the sum of P15,086.43; that notwithstanding this debt, the Compania General de Tabacos granted&nbsp; another new credit of 7,000 pesos to the same party,&nbsp; Escay, in&nbsp; order that&nbsp; he&nbsp; might continue the work of grinding, on his&nbsp; aforesaid hacienda,&nbsp; which sum was to&nbsp; be&nbsp; delivered to him in installments&nbsp; in the&nbsp; months and for the purposes expressed in the&nbsp; instrument and, added to the previous sum of&nbsp; 15,086.43 pesos, made a total of P22,086.43,&nbsp; the&nbsp; debtor being allowed, by regular deliveries of&nbsp; sugar&nbsp; in Iloilo, P1.50 for each picul of sugar; that the debtor Escay&nbsp; agreed&nbsp; to deliver to&nbsp; the creditor company the entire crop of the years&nbsp; 1903&nbsp; and 1904 that should&nbsp; be&nbsp; produced on&nbsp; his hacienda, estimated at 5,000 piculs of sugar, without his selling&nbsp; or&nbsp; assigning to&nbsp; anyone else or&nbsp; deducting therefrom the smallest portion for any consideration or under any pretext; that&nbsp; the deliveries of the sugar were to be made until the&nbsp; 1st of&nbsp; March, 1905, fixed as the date when&nbsp; the entire crop should be ground, the company reserving the right to place an agent on the hacienda, at&nbsp; the&nbsp; expense of the debtor Escay, whenever it&nbsp; should so consider proper; that the amounts received, as well&nbsp; as&nbsp; those the debtor should&nbsp; receive up to the total of the credit allowed, should draw&nbsp; interest at the&nbsp; rate of 9 per cent&nbsp; per annum, from the date of their receipt, the aforesaid 1st of March, 1905, being fixed as the date for the settlement&nbsp; of the&nbsp; payments of capital and interest; that it was agreed that, if the sugar of the crop of 1903-4 should be insufficient to balance the accounts of the&nbsp; debtor, the crop of&nbsp; 1904-5 should be&nbsp; delivered to the creditor company in the same manner&nbsp; and under the same conditions,&nbsp; the date for the&nbsp; complete payment and settlement of the capital&nbsp; and&nbsp; interest in such case&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; extended; that, among other conditions and in all cases, Escay should allow the company 1% per cent as commission on the total amount of the sugar delivered;&nbsp; that as&nbsp; security and for the purpose of an exact compliance with the engagements contained in the said instrument, the debtor Escay deeded, conveyed, and sold to the creditor company&nbsp; all the fruits and crops of his hacienda, delivering them by <i>traditio manu longa </i>and transferring&nbsp; full dominion over them until the debt should be satisfied; that in case of failure to pay the same on&nbsp; the&nbsp; conditions expressed,,&nbsp; the&nbsp; creditor company could,&nbsp; if&nbsp; it so wished,&nbsp; take possession of the said fruits and crops, sell them or store them, .for which&nbsp; purpose the debtor Escay conferred ample&nbsp; and&nbsp; sufficient power, without limitation whatever, in favor of the creditor company, binding himself to hold as proper and final whatever proceedings might be taken by the latter by virtue of this instrument; that,&nbsp; notwithstanding all the foregoing, the debtor Escay had agreed to sell under <i>pacto de retro,</i> as a guaranty&nbsp; for the&nbsp; due fulfilment of the obligation assumed by&nbsp; him, the Hacienda Lanoglanog, now called the&nbsp; Teresa, of which he was the owner, together with all the buildings, machinery, and other appurtenances existing thereon, and a house constructed of&nbsp; stone and wood&nbsp; with&nbsp; a zinc&nbsp; roof, belonging to&nbsp; his&nbsp; wife,&nbsp; Cristeta&nbsp; Gonzaga, and&nbsp; situated in the town of Bacolod, for the sum of P22,086.43, on condition that if, during the&nbsp; term stipulated or before the 1st of March,&nbsp; 1905,&nbsp; he&nbsp; should pay all&nbsp; the said sum, with the interest due&nbsp; thereon, to the creditor&nbsp; company, with the deliveries of sugar agreed upon, the latter would execute to him an instrument of reversion of the said hacienda and house; but if the said&nbsp; term, to&nbsp; terminate on the 1st of March,&nbsp; 1905,&nbsp; should elapse and&nbsp; the debtor Escay should be unable to avail himself of his right of redemption, then this sale should assume the character of one absolutely and irrevocably consummated and the company should be considered&nbsp; to have acquired all the rights pertaining to&nbsp; it in connection with the&nbsp; said properties; that it was also stipulated&nbsp; between both parties that, if the company should take possession of the properties sold for any reason whatever,&nbsp; at any time, that it should collect the principal and interest owing by&nbsp; Escay,&nbsp; the latter or&nbsp; his heirs should recover the absolute ownership of the said properties, the debtor binding himself,&nbsp; in&nbsp; his own name and in that of his wife,&nbsp; who, for&nbsp; this purpose, had conferred power on him by an instrument executed in Bacolod,&nbsp; June 1,&nbsp; 1903, to guarantee the company&nbsp; the peaceful possession of the property.<br><br>On the&nbsp; 25th of November,&nbsp; 1907, the defendant Cristeta Gonzaga filed, with the permission of the court, an amended answer, setting forth that&nbsp; she admitted the facts alleged in paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and&nbsp; 10 of the amended complaint; that she denied the facts alleged in&nbsp; paragraphs 4 and 9 of the same, and reserved her answer with regard to the exactness of the copy of the said instrument, Exhibit 1, until she should have compared it with its original; that as a special defense she alleged that in the instrument of acknowledgment of&nbsp; the&nbsp; debt,&nbsp; executed on June&nbsp; 6,&nbsp; 1903, before the notary Yulo,&nbsp; the following condition&nbsp; was stipulated between the&nbsp; parties: It is agreed by both contracting parties that should the&nbsp; Compania General de Tabacos, for any reason whatever, take possession of the properties sold, as soon as the latter shall have collected the principal and interest owing it by the said Escay,&nbsp; it shall return to him or to his heirs the ownership of the properties concerned; and,&nbsp; therefore,&nbsp; the defendant prayed the&nbsp; court to absolve her from the complaint, with the costs in her favor.<br><br>The case having come to trial and&nbsp; the parol evidence having been adduced by both parties,&nbsp; the exhibits being made a part of the record, the judge, on January 30,&nbsp; 1908, rendered judgment in the&nbsp; case, sentencing the defendant personally and as the administratrix of the intestate estate of&nbsp; her deceased husband,&nbsp; Emilio&nbsp; Escay, to pay to the plaintiff the sum of P29,824.43 and the interest thereon at the rate of 9 per cent per annum from the 1st of&nbsp; July, 1906,&nbsp; until paid, and the&nbsp; costs.&nbsp; Against this judgment the defendant party took exception and prayed for a new trial, on the ground that the said judgment was manifestly contrary to the&nbsp; weight of the evidence, which petition was denied&nbsp; by&nbsp; the court,&nbsp; on February 8,&nbsp; 1908, and exception taken&nbsp; thereto by the appellant, who duly filed the&nbsp; corresponding bill&nbsp; of exceptions&nbsp; which was&nbsp; approved&nbsp; and transmitted to the office of the clerk&nbsp; of this&nbsp; court.<br><br>It is asserted in appellant's&nbsp; brief that the&nbsp; lower court, in passing judgment&nbsp; in this case, incurred the following errors:<br><ol type="I"><li>The lower&nbsp; court erred in&nbsp; finding that Emilio Escay owed the&nbsp; Compañia General de&nbsp; Tabacos de Filipinas, on June 20, 1905, the net&nbsp; sum of P29,824.43.<br><br></li><li>The&nbsp; lower court erred in&nbsp; stating that&nbsp; it&nbsp; had been proved&nbsp; that the&nbsp; deceased Escay, while still living, received a demand for the payment of the said balance of P29.824.43, and that he gave no heed whatever thereto.<br><br></li><li>The lower court erred in finding that Exhibit 1 sets forth stipulations whjch clearly show that the credit&nbsp; was a mortgage one.<br><br></li><li>The&nbsp; lower court erred in&nbsp; deciding, when interpreting the substance of the contract, that the parties to this suit are convinced that the amount claimed is a mortgage debt, and that&nbsp; the contract,&nbsp; Exhibit&nbsp; 1,&nbsp; is a&nbsp; mortgage&nbsp; credit against Escay, and not a&nbsp; sale under <i>pacto de&nbsp; retro. </i><br><br></li><li>The&nbsp; lower court erred&nbsp; in finding that the covenant alleged&nbsp; by&nbsp; the defendant&nbsp; in the&nbsp; special defense contained in her answer, is a conditional&nbsp; covenant which gave to the creditor the right to take&nbsp; and keep possession&nbsp; of the properties&nbsp; during the term allowed&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; payment&nbsp; of the debt, and&nbsp; never could&nbsp; be understood to be&nbsp; a perpetual covenant.</li></ol>Apparently, it is shown by the statements&nbsp; set forth in the judgment appealed from&nbsp; and by the terms of the sentence contained&nbsp; therein,&nbsp; that the court, in harmony with the tenor&nbsp; of&nbsp; the complaint,&nbsp; was of the opinion that the complaint claimed payment of a mortgage credit by virtue of the stipulations&nbsp; of an&nbsp; instrument of the date of June 6, 1903.<br><br>It is true that, judging&nbsp; from the&nbsp; statements made&nbsp; by the debtor Emilio Escay in the said instrument, the latter received as a loan from the Compania General&nbsp; de Tabacos various sums aggregating P22,086.43, bearing&nbsp; interest at 9&nbsp; per cent per annum; but it is no less true that the said debtor, to&nbsp; insure the fulfillment of the engagement&nbsp; to pay his debt with the sugar that he might succeed in producing on his&nbsp; Hacienda Lanoglanog or Teresa during the years 1903,1904, and&nbsp; 1905, had to deed over and convey by sale to his creditor all&nbsp; the fruits and crops&nbsp; of the&nbsp; said hacienda, authorizing the&nbsp; latter, in case of nonpayment, to take possession of the said&nbsp; fruits and&nbsp; crops, to dispose of them and to sell them, and he also agreed&nbsp; to sell to the creditor company the&nbsp; said hacienda under pacto de retro, together with&nbsp; its buildings,&nbsp; machinery, and. other&nbsp; appurtenances existing thereon, and&nbsp; the house owned&nbsp; by&nbsp; his&nbsp; wife, Cristeta Gonzaga, situated in&nbsp; the&nbsp; town&nbsp; of Bacolod, for&nbsp; the aforesaid&nbsp; sum received as a loan, the company binding itself to resell&nbsp; to him the&nbsp; said properties&nbsp; if&nbsp; the&nbsp; debtor should be able to pay his&nbsp; debt&nbsp; with&nbsp; sugar; otherwise&nbsp; the sale was to be absolute and irrevocable.<br><br>It was&nbsp; also stipulated&nbsp; between&nbsp; the&nbsp; contracting parties that should the company take possession, for any&nbsp; reason whatever, of the properties&nbsp; sold, once it had collected&nbsp; the principal&nbsp; and interest due, the&nbsp; ownership of the said properties&nbsp; should revert&nbsp; to the debtor Escay or&nbsp; to&nbsp; his heirs.<br><br>With the exception&nbsp; of these stipulations&nbsp; and the clause guaranteeing possession, the aforesaid instrument expresses no special&nbsp; contract&nbsp; of mortgage&nbsp; of the said&nbsp; properties, nor any agreement nor even a statement reproducing&nbsp; or maintaining, in&nbsp; the said instrument of 1903, the mortgage contracted&nbsp; in the previous&nbsp; instrument of June, 1902,&nbsp; for this latter&nbsp; concerns&nbsp; a loan of P8,000, and&nbsp; the mere reference made in the former to this credit, secured by a mortgage on the said hacienda, and the fact of such&nbsp; loan being included, on account of its not having&nbsp; been paid,&nbsp; in a larger one which is the subject of the said subsequent instrument of&nbsp; 1903, is not sufficient to show the&nbsp; existence of a mortgage, without the manifest will of the&nbsp; interested parties, when what was expressly stipulated afterwards&nbsp; is a sale with right of repurchase.<br><br>On the foregoing hypothesis, it is unquestionably evident that the plaintiff&nbsp; party,&nbsp; the&nbsp; cessionary of the rights&nbsp; of the Compañia General de Tabacos, is not entitled&nbsp; to prosecute an action&nbsp; for the&nbsp; collection of a mortgage credit on realty, under the&nbsp; authority&nbsp; of the provisions&nbsp; of articles 254 et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure and by virtue of a contract of mortgage based on, articles 1874 et seq. of the Civil Code and articles 138 et seq. of the Mortgage Law.<br><br>The sum loaned to&nbsp; the debtor was converted&nbsp; into the selling price&nbsp; of the properties specified in the said instrument, according to the stipulations therein made between the contracting parties, and the term agreed&nbsp; upon for the repurchase has much more than elapsed; and although the debtor remained in possession of the&nbsp; said properties sold, notwithstanding his not&nbsp; having&nbsp; duly repurchased them, the creditor has not thereby lost his right thereto,&nbsp; provided he exercises&nbsp; it in due time, by virtue&nbsp; of the contract contained in the said instrument of June 6,&nbsp; 1903.&nbsp; (Arts. 1507,&nbsp; 1509, 1518, Civil Code.)<br><br>The defendant appellant acknowledges the fact and the legitimacy of the sale with right of repurchase aforementioned, and he has not alleged any ground whatever by virtue of which the said contract of sale may be considered dissolved and without&nbsp; legal&nbsp; effect and&nbsp; the return of its price&nbsp; demanded; wherefore the suit filed by the plaintiff Ricardo Nolan&nbsp; is&nbsp; from all points of&nbsp; view improper, and therefore&nbsp; the judgment appealed&nbsp; from&nbsp; can not be&nbsp; sustained, the court below having incurred errors 3&nbsp; and 4 of those&nbsp; alleged by the appellant, as hereinbefore shown.&nbsp; In view of the nature and fundamental basis of this&nbsp; decision, it is not necessary to discuss the propriety or impropriety of the other&nbsp; errors attributed to the judgment.<br><br>Wherefore, it is proper in our opinion, in reversing the judgment appealed from,&nbsp; to absolve, as we do hereby absolve, from the said complaint the defendant Cristeta Gonzaga,personally&nbsp; and as the administratrix&nbsp; of the estate of&nbsp; her deceased&nbsp; husband&nbsp; Emilio&nbsp; Escay,&nbsp; without special finding as to the&nbsp; costs in both instances, and to the plaintiff is reserved his rights pursuant to the agreement contained&nbsp; in the instrument&nbsp; aforesaid, and&nbsp; he&nbsp; may exercise the same, should he&nbsp; deem&nbsp; proper so to do, in conformity with&nbsp; the law.<br><br><i> Arellano, C. J.,&nbsp; Johnson, Moreland</i>, and <i>Trent, JJ.</i>, concur.<br></div>
