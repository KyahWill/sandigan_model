				<BR><BR><p></p><div align="justify">This defendant&nbsp; was&nbsp; charged&nbsp; with the crime of libel, alleged to have be committed as follows:<blockquote><p>"I. On or about&nbsp; the&nbsp; month of December,&nbsp; 1907, in the municipality of Santa Maria,&nbsp; Province of Bulacan, P. I., the said&nbsp; accused, Jose S. Serapio, did and criminally, with the&nbsp; intention of attacking, reviling, and expose in public hatred and scorn the good name,&nbsp; virtue, and reputation of&nbsp; Bonifacio Morales, write, publish, and send by mail,&nbsp; addressed&nbsp; to the Executive Secretary,&nbsp; an anonymous communication,&nbsp; the pertinent&nbsp; portion whereof is as follows:<br></p><p>" '11.&nbsp; Bonifacio Morales is the murderer of 12 peaceful and&nbsp; honest&nbsp; men are: Mariano&nbsp; Ramirez,&nbsp; municipal president of Bocaue; the teacher of the primary school of Marilao, Emigdio Perez, Candido del Rosario, Juan de Ve Manuel Valderrama, a boy 13 years&nbsp; old&nbsp; of the&nbsp; barrio of Alangalang, one Budio, musician, Mariano Mendoza, all of Santa Maria, an old man of the barrio of Sapang-palay of San&nbsp; Jose and two brothers, sons of Francisco Pascual of Norzagaray.&nbsp;&nbsp; He has committed various assaults and robberies, which are: The robbery of Captain Ciano Caluloua of Meycauayan, the robbery of Simeona of Angat, whereby a girl 12 or 13 years old was killed the robbery of P420 from Juana&nbsp; Reyes of Bocaue, all in the year 1899.'</p><p>"II.&nbsp; On the same date or time, to wit, December, 1907, in the&nbsp; municipal Santa Maria, Province of Bulacan, P. I., the said accused, Jose S.&nbsp; Serapio willfully&nbsp; and criminally, with the intention of attacking,&nbsp; reviling,&nbsp; a to public hatred and scorn the good name, virtue, and&nbsp; reputation of Bonifacio Morales,&nbsp; write, publish,&nbsp; and send by mail, addressed&nbsp; to the Executive Secretary,&nbsp; an anonymous communication,&nbsp; the&nbsp; pertinent portion whereof is as follows:</p><p>" '12. Bonifacio Morales is known in the&nbsp; Secret Service Department of Ma a&nbsp; criminal,&nbsp; whose&nbsp; crimes&nbsp; the detective&nbsp; Manuel&nbsp; Arbona discovered in year 1903 *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *'</p><p>"III. At the same time, to&nbsp; wit, December, 1907, in the same place and pr the said accused, Jose S. Serapio, did willfully and criminally, with the of attacking, reviling, and exposing to public&nbsp; hatred and scorn the good name,&nbsp; virtue,&nbsp; and reputation&nbsp; of Bonifacio Morales,&nbsp; write, publish, an by mail, addressed to the Executive Secretary, an anonymous communication the pertinent portion whereof is as follows:</p><p>"'15. Bonifacio Morales is an inveterate gambler find to get money he&nbsp; us diabolical methods, as in the case of the General Santa Ana in 1903, who surrendered voluntarily in order to get within the pale of the law, but M tried to demonstrate to the Government that he was caught by him in order to secure the reward offered by the Government.</p><p>"'All the foregoing is little, if the provincial government would get int discovering many crimes committed in the province by Morales and his people.'</p><p>"IV. All&nbsp; the facts above specified were written,&nbsp; published, and address the&nbsp; Executive Secretary of the Islands by the said accused, maliciously, willfully, and at the time the slandered Bonifacio. Morales was discharging duties of the office of justice of the peace of the municipality of Santa Maria, Province of Bulacan, P. I., and all the acts above specified were committed in violation of the law."</p></blockquote><p>Upon said complaint the defendant was duly arraigned. Upon&nbsp; arraignment the defendant, by his attorneys,&nbsp; presented the following&nbsp; demurrer:</p><blockquote><p>"I. The facts alleged in the complaint&nbsp; do not constitute a crime.</p><p>"II. It appears from the allegation in&nbsp; the complaint that if there were it has prescribed."</p></blockquote><p>The fiscal of the Province of Bulacan and the attorney for the defendant, each&nbsp; presented written and oral arguments against and&nbsp; in&nbsp; support of&nbsp; said demurrer.&nbsp; The attorney for the defendant&nbsp; (p.&nbsp; 82 of Expediente)&nbsp; seems have&nbsp; waived&nbsp; his contention that the facts stated in the complaint were insufficient to constitute a cause of action.</p><p>After hearing the&nbsp; arguments of&nbsp; the&nbsp; respective parties, the Honorable Alberto Barretto, judge, in a very interesting opinion, decided that the ground of said demurrer was not well founded,&nbsp; but sustained the&nbsp; second and&nbsp; ordered the prosecuting attorney of the province to present a&nbsp; new complaint.</p><p>With reference&nbsp; to&nbsp; the second ground of the demurrer. Judge Barretto in decision said:</p><blockquote><p>"With reference to the&nbsp; second ground for exception, counsel for the defe maintains that the crime has&nbsp; prescribed under&nbsp; the provisions of the law force in the Islands and supports&nbsp; such conclusion&nbsp; by asserting that absence of a definite provision in Act No. 277 of the Philippine Commission which fixes the time during which the&nbsp; penal action&nbsp; arising from the crime of libel&nbsp; may be exercised, the time which article 131 of the Penal Code fix the prescription of the crimes of calumny and insists is strictly applicable.</p><p>"Against this contention&nbsp; of the defense, the&nbsp; Attorney-General and the private prosecutor maintain&nbsp; that the prescription of a general nature contained in said article 131 is not applicable,&nbsp; for two reasons:</p><p>"First, because the crime of libel is entirely distinct and independent f calumny and insults; and</p><p>"Second, because that provision of the code&nbsp; in the matter of prescriptio crimes is not applicable to the crimes created and&nbsp; punished by special l promulgated by the Philippine Commission or the Philippine Legislature.</p><p>"After carefully considering the case,&nbsp; the court finds that while the crime of&nbsp; libel differs from that of calumny, defined and penalized in article 452, not so with respect to the crimes of insults provided for and penalized i articles&nbsp; 456<em> et seq</em>. of the Penal Code.&nbsp;&nbsp; Under said articles and paragraph of article 277, the court does not understand&nbsp; to&nbsp; exist the&nbsp; same essential&nbsp; difference&nbsp; between the crime&nbsp; of&nbsp; insults in writing and that In both the object of the perpetrator of&nbsp; the crime&nbsp; is to attack&nbsp; the honesty, virtue,&nbsp; or the reputation of a person, exposing him to public scorn, or ridicule, characteristic elements that are likewise&nbsp; found in t insults in writing, defined and penalized in article 456 of the Penal Cod connection with 458 thereof.&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>It is certain that Act No. 277 has not way fixed the prescription for the penal action in&nbsp; the crimes of libel.</em> There is no&nbsp; provision in said Act that fixes the time within which the a arising from a libelous imputation may prescribe, but it is&nbsp; not less certain that by applying the <em>rule that a criminal act is&nbsp; not prescriptible unless law&nbsp; expressly fixes&nbsp; such prescription,</em> the crime of libel and other prosecuted at any time, which would naturally make the provisions of&nbsp; the Act absurd, for a case might arise where a&nbsp; penal&nbsp; action might&nbsp; be exercised even after the person concerned&nbsp; in&nbsp; the crime or responsible t had died.</p><p>"In support of his contention, the Attorney-General cites the precedent established by the court in the cases of U. S. <em>vs.</em>&nbsp; Lao Lock Hing Rep., 86) and U. S. <em>vs</em>. Calaguas&nbsp; (14 Phil. Rep.,&nbsp; 739).&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>What Supreme Court has established in these cases is&nbsp; that the rules of the Penal Code cannot be applied in the penalty to be imposed in the crimes punished by&nbsp; a special Act,&nbsp; but only the characteristic&nbsp; and special American principles of discretion in the punishment.</em> In said cases the Supreme Court has down no principle applicable to the case at bar, that is, to prescription the crime.</p><p>"The court believes that the provisions of the Penal Code with reference extinction of penal responsibility are applicable to the case, like those general character included in Book&nbsp; I of&nbsp; the Penal Code,&nbsp; which refer to essential requisites common to all&nbsp; crimes.&nbsp; No special law fixes these defines crime,&nbsp; but starting from the definition previously laid down by the common penal legislation it defines and establishes the requisites peculiar special crime it is sought to correct; but still, the court thinks that n deny that before classifying an act as a special crime it becomes necessary see whether&nbsp; or not the essential&nbsp; requisites&nbsp; common&nbsp; to&nbsp; every&nbsp; crime present.&nbsp;&nbsp; If such principles are of undoubted application, even without provision of the special law, the court thinks that those of&nbsp; the general legislation fixing the&nbsp; period within which the penal responsibility is e are likewise, for both are essential to make the law consistent and reason Under these considerations,&nbsp; the court holds&nbsp; that the ground for exception indicated should be sustained, and he therefore sustains the second ground demurrer or exception, and understanding that&nbsp; said objection&nbsp; can be corrected, orders the presentation of&nbsp; a new complaint."</p></blockquote><p>From that decision an appeal was taken to this court by Mr.&nbsp; Imperial, a for the Government, who made the following assignments of error:</p><blockquote><p>"The trial&nbsp; court incurred a legal error in&nbsp; sustaining the second ground demurrer, and in declaring that the crime alleged in the complaint has prescribed in accordance with the third paragraph of article 131 of the Code of the Philippines."</p></blockquote><p>Under this assignment of error the only question presented by the appellant is, whether the prescription fixed by article 131 of the Penal Code for offense of calumny and insults (arts. 452-457) is applicable to the crime of&nbsp; libel as defined and&nbsp; punished&nbsp; under an Act&nbsp; (No.&nbsp; 277)&nbsp; of the Philippine Commission.</p><p>Calumny, as defined by the Penal Code, is: "The false imputation of a crime upon which a prosecution might&nbsp; be instituted by the Government on its own motion."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Art. 452.)&nbsp; This false&nbsp; imputation&nbsp; of crime may be expressed publicly&nbsp; in writing&nbsp; (art.&nbsp; 453)&nbsp; or orally (art. 454).&nbsp; The punishment provided, when the calumny is expressed publicly in writing, <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correccional </span>in its minimum and medium&nbsp; degrees" (imprisonment six months and one day to four years and two months) "and&nbsp; a fine of not more than 12,500 <em>pesetas</em>" (P2,500)&nbsp; (art. 453).&nbsp; If the calumny expressed orally simply, the punishment is "<em>arresto mayor</em> in its degree (imprisonment from one month and one day to two months) and a fine of not less than 625 and not more than 6,250 <em>pesetas</em>" (P125 Pl,250)&nbsp; (art. 454).</p><p>It will be noted by reading said articles 453 and 454, that the punishment calumny depends not only upon whether it was expressed publicly, in writ or orally, but also whether&nbsp; the&nbsp; crime imputed was "a grave felony,"&nbsp; o less grave felony'&nbsp;&nbsp; When a felony is&nbsp; grave or less&nbsp; grave is defined the Penal Code.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Art. 6.)</p><p>In the case of the crime of "insults," it may be either a <em> statement act</em>. In case it is a statement, it may also be either in writing or The penalty fixed for insults also depends on whether the offense is "gr "less grave," or "trifling."&nbsp;&nbsp; The punishment for the&nbsp; offense of "insult or "less grave" is banishment,&nbsp; in its minimum and maximum degrees&nbsp; (for period of two years four months and one day, to six&nbsp; years) "and a fine of not less than 325 and not more than 6,250 <em>pesetas</em>" (P65 to P1, (Art. 458.)&nbsp; If the insult is "trifling" the punishment is "<em>arresto mayor minimum degree" (imprisonment for a period of one month and one day to two months) "and a fine of not less than 325 and not, more&nbsp; than 3,250 pesetas</em>" (P65 to P650).</p><p>The crime of libel is defined by the law&nbsp; (Act No. 277)&nbsp; of the Philippine Commission as "a malicious defamation, expressed either in writing, printing or by&nbsp; signs or pictures, or&nbsp; the like, or&nbsp; public theatrical exhibitions, blacken/the memory of one who&nbsp; is dead or to impeach the honesty, virtue,&nbsp; or&nbsp; reputation, or to publish the alleged&nbsp; or natural defects o who is alive, and thereby expose him to public hatred, contempt, or ridicule."</p><p>Under this law (Act No. 277)&nbsp; it will be noted that the crime of libel c never be committed by <em>oral expressions</em>; it must always be express either in writing, printing,&nbsp; or by signs&nbsp; or pictures or the like, or p theatrical exhibitions.&nbsp; The punishment provided under said Act (No. 277 always within the sound discretion of the court.&nbsp; The court, in fixing t penalty, is not limited by any of the rules of the Penal Code in&nbsp; relations the grades of punishment therein prescribed.</p><p>It is contended by the appellee, that inasmuch as the Act (No. 277) of t Philippine Commission covers a part of the offenses of calumny and insults, that it is not a special law, as that phrase is used in article&nbsp; 7 of the Code, and that the&nbsp; provisions of article 131 (of the Penal Code) relation calumny and insults apply to the crime of libel&nbsp; as defined by said Act 277).&nbsp;&nbsp; This contention makes it necessary to define "special laws," as phrase&nbsp; is used in article 7&nbsp; of the Penal Code.&nbsp;&nbsp; Does this phrase <em>" especiales</em>" as used in the Penal&nbsp; Code (article 7) have the meaning applied to the phrase "special laws," as the same is generally&nbsp; used?&nbsp; B under the&nbsp; common&nbsp; law and the civil law, one of the general classifications of laws is that of (a) general and (b) special.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first, or general defined as a law which applies&nbsp; to<em> all of&nbsp; the&nbsp; people</em> of the state or to <i>all of a</i> <em>particular class of persons</em> in the state, with&nbsp; equal and obligation.&nbsp; A special&nbsp; law,&nbsp; as the phrase is&nbsp; generally used, is a which applies to&nbsp; particular individuals in the state or to a particular or portion of the state only. The phrase "general law" is sometimes subs by the phrase "public law" in&nbsp; contradistinction to special or private Mr. Black,&nbsp; in his very valuable law&nbsp; dictionary, defines a general law, contra-distinguished from&nbsp; one that is special or local, as a law that em a class&nbsp; of&nbsp; subjects or places, and does not omit any subject or place naturally belonging to such class. (Van Riper&nbsp; et al. <em>vs.</em> Parsons Law,&nbsp; 1.)&nbsp;&nbsp; It is confidently contended that the phrase "<em>leyes especiales," </em>as used&nbsp; in the Penal Code (article 1) is not used with&nbsp; this general signification: <em>In fact, said phrase may refer not to a special&nbsp; law a defined, but to a general law.</em>&nbsp; A careful&nbsp; reading of said article 7 indicates, that the phrase "<em>leyes especiales"</em>&nbsp; was not used&nbsp; to s "special laws" in&nbsp; the general signification of that phrase.&nbsp;&nbsp; The artic be noted, Simply says,&nbsp; in effect,&nbsp; that when a crime is made punishable under some other law than the Penal Code, it&nbsp; (the crime)&nbsp; is not subjec the&nbsp; provisions of said code.&nbsp; We are confirmed in this opinion by an examination of the Spanish jurisprudence upon the same subject. Viada (1 Viada, 84),&nbsp; in his valuable commentaries&nbsp; on the provisions of the Pena Code, in discussing article 7, practically limits himself to an examination <i>"leyes especiales"</i> to which the provisions of the Penal Code are not applicable. In answering the question:&nbsp; <em>"Cuales son las leyes especia penan delitos,</em>" he simply enumerates such laws as follows, to wit:&nbsp; </p><ol><li>Ordenanza Militar;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; </li><li> Ley de Organizacion y Atribuciones de los Tribunales de Guerra:&nbsp; </li>&nbsp; <li>Codigo Penal del Ejercito;&nbsp; </li>&nbsp; <li> Ley de Enjuiciamiento Militar;<br>&nbsp; </li><li>Delitos de Contrabando y Defraudacion;<br></li>&nbsp; <li> Delitos Electorates;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></li><li>Ordenanzas&nbsp; de Montes;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></li><li>Ley Municipal;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </li><li> Ley de Reclutamiento y reemplazo del Ejercito;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br></li><li> Ley sobre policia;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></li><li> Ley sobre conservacion de los Ferrocarriles;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </li><li> Ley de Caza;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></li><li>Ley sobre Usurpation;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></li><li>Ley sobre la Falsification de Patentes de Invencion;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></li><li> Ley sobre Proteccidn a los Menores; and others which might be mentioned.</li></ol><p>An examination&nbsp; of these&nbsp; laws&nbsp; denominated&nbsp; "<em>leyes&nbsp; especiales</em>," that phrase is used in the Penal Code, shows that, in fact, most of them general laws in the sense that they apply to all the persons in&nbsp; the state to all of a particular class.&nbsp; The rule which we now adopt,&nbsp; to wit: That when a crime is made punishable by a law other than by the provisions of the Penal Code, the provisions&nbsp; of said code do not apply, as has been heretofore announced&nbsp; by this court.&nbsp;&nbsp; (U. S. <em>vs.</em> Lao Lock Hing, Rep., 86; U. S. <em>vs.</em> Calaguas, 14 Phil. Rep., 739).&nbsp; In the case o vs. Lao&nbsp; Lock Hing, <em>supra</em>, the defendant was charged&nbsp; with a violation of the Opium Law.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Sec.&nbsp; 31, Act No. 1761.)&nbsp; In deciding the the court,&nbsp; speaking through Mr.&nbsp; Justice Torres, said:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"The crime under consideration consists of the violation of a special la referred to in article 7 of the Penal Code, and consequently the provision said code and the classification of the crimes comprised therein are&nbsp; no applicable in the present case.&nbsp; The crime must be punished under the provisions of&nbsp; the Act&nbsp; (No. 1761) which the sovereign power,&nbsp; by virtue its authority, saw fit to enact for the good of the country and its inhabitants.&nbsp; Wherefore, inasmuch as it is an act which&nbsp; the lawmaker ha declared to be invested with the attributes of a crime, the overruling o demurrer and the prosecution of the case are in accordance with the law."</p></blockquote><p>In the case of U. S. <em>vs</em>. Calaguas, <em>supra,</em>&nbsp; the defendant w charged with having, by means of a wrench, removed several screws and fishplates from the line of the railroad, in the municipality of Santa R Province of Nueva Ecija, It was&nbsp; alleged that he thereby damaged the lin and that a derailment of the train would&nbsp; have occurred, had it not been discovered in time.&nbsp; The court decided that the "<span style="font-style: italic;">Ley de Ferrocarrile</span>s was a <em>ley especial,</em> under said article 7, and&nbsp; that the general provi the Penal&nbsp; Code did not apply.&nbsp; This court, speaking through its chief justice&nbsp; Mr. Arellano, said:</p><blockquote><p>"Crimes which are punished by special laws are not subject to the provision of this article (article 7 of the. Penal Code).&nbsp;&nbsp; The act&nbsp; of wrenching screws and fishplates from the rails of a railroad line is punished by a law,&nbsp; that which governs the policing and preservation of railroads, came by the law of November 23, 1877, made applicable to the Philippine by royal decree of August 6, 1875.&nbsp; In reality this provision relates to th November 14,&nbsp; 1855, one almost&nbsp; identical to that of 1877, article 16 of reads: 'He who shall voluntarily destroy or damage a&nbsp; railway&nbsp; line * * * shall be&nbsp; punished with the penalty of <em>prision correctional</em>'"</p></blockquote><p>In the more recent case of U. S. <em>vs</em>. Fuster (10 Off. Gaz., 1048) very brief opinion,&nbsp; when the&nbsp; question&nbsp; was squarely presented whether provisions&nbsp; of the Penal "Code relating to the prescription or limitatio action for calumny and insults were applicable, <em>this court refused to the rule of prescription&nbsp; or limitation of the Penal Code to the&nbsp; crime as defined&nbsp; by the law of&nbsp; the United States Commission.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; (Act No. 277.)</p><p>This court has refused in many cases to apply some of the general provisions of the Penal Code to the laws of the United&nbsp; States&nbsp; Commission,&nbsp; or to special decrees of&nbsp; the Kingdom of Spain&nbsp; applicable to the Philippine I thereby holding,&nbsp; in effect, that such laws, when&nbsp; they&nbsp; provided a penal for their violation, were "<em>leyes especiales</em>," as that phrase is u Penal Code.</p><p>See U. S. <em>vs.</em> Hutchinson&nbsp; (5 Phil. Rep., 343, November 21, 1905), court refused to apply the provisions as to subsidiary&nbsp; imprisonment the nonpayment of a fine&nbsp; under Acts Nos. 610&nbsp; and 652 of the United States Commission;</p><p>U.

Rep., 570, January 24,&nbsp; 1906), where refused to apply the rule with reference to subsidiary imprisonment to a of Act No. 619 of the United States Commission;</p><p>U. S. <em>vs</em>.

S. <em>vs.</em> Carvajal et al. (4 Off. Gaz,, 705, April 16,1906), wher refused again to apply the rules as to subsidiary imprisonment of the Penal Code to&nbsp; section 8 of Act No. 292 of the United States&nbsp; Commission; in t case, the court, speaking through Mr.&nbsp; Justice Torres, said:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"The provisions of the Penal Code which authorize the imposition of subsi imprisonment for the nonpayment of a fine imposed are not applicable to those guilty of&nbsp; crimes punished under said Act&nbsp; (No. 292) and other Acts of the Commission, <em>the Penal Code being based upon an entirely different system of&nbsp; legislation.</em>"</p></blockquote><p>U.&nbsp; S. <em>vs.</em> Ang&nbsp; Kan&nbsp; Ko (6 Phil.
