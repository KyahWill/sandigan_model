				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In this case the action brought is not the action <em>ex delicto 
</em>provided for in section 30 of the Code of Civil Procedure. No attempt has 
been made to proceed against the defendants for contempt, nor has any demand 
been made that they be imprisoned until they pay over the money unlawfully in 
their hands. The action brought is the action eno contractu arising from the 
contract of agency which appears in the record. Mr. Mobley, having paid the sum 
of 300 pesos into court, one of the defendants, who appeared for Roman Sarmiento 
in a criminal case prosecuted against him, asked that the money be delivered " 
to the wife of the accused," and made this request in the conditional form " 
they being poor people." Then Sarmiento's wife expressly authorized Messrs, 
Montagne &amp; Dominguez to receive from the clerk the amount so paid into the 
court, the judge approved this authorization, and by virtue thereof Messrs. 
Montagne &amp; Dominguez received the money in question. Hence the defendants' 
title to the possession of this sum of money is the contract of agency referred 
to, and not the payment of fees as alleged. An agent does not become the owner 
of that which he receives in the name and as the property of his principal.
<p>If the agent believes that such a sum of money in his possession should be 
paid to him as a compensation for fees still owing, he should bring the proper 
action for that purpose against his client, Sarmiento, and not against his 
principal, Angela Cabrera. Whatever action Messrs. Montagne &amp; Dominguez may 
believe they can successfully maintain for unpaid fees is open to them, and only 
in such action would the evidence introduced by them in the trial of this case 
be competent.</p>
<p>For the reasons stated we affirm the judgment below, with the costs of this 
instance against the appellants. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Mapa, McDonough,</em> and <em>Johnson, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
