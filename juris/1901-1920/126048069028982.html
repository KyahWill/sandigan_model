				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> Under Genera! Orders, No. 58, series 1900, which is the law of criminal procedure in force, the Government has the right of  appeal from all judgments of acquittal rendered in criminal cases.  The letter and spirit of the order itself are the most conclusive argument in support of this right on the part of the Government.</p>
<p> Its letter, because this right is thus expressly declared in section 43.  "From all final judgments," it says, "of the Courts of First Instance or courts of similar jurisdiction, and  in all cases  in which the law now provides  for appeals  *  *  *  an appeal may be taken to the Supreme Court *   *   *."  If an appeal can be taken against all final  judgments,  the judgment of  acquittal being also final judgment, it is evident that an appeal lies against a judgment of acquittal.  This law grants the right of appeal in all cases in which it was formerly allowed by the local "existing laws," declared in force by section 1 of said General Orders, No. 58.  If prior to this law the right of appeal in cases of acquittal was allowed, as will be more explicitly shown hereafter,  now as then, and  after the publication of said order, the right of appeal from  judgments of acquittal will  continue to be granted.</p>
<p> Moreover, section 64 is quite plain and reads as follows: "In case of appeal after judgment, the defendant  may be admitted  to bail  pending action on the appeal:  (1)  As a matter of right if  <em>the appeal  is from an acquittal</em> *  *   *."  Under the letter of the order, then, the Government has the right of appeal  from  an acquittal.</p>
<p> In its spirit, General Orders, No. 58, undoubtedly contemplates the  allowance of the right of appeal from judgment of acquittal.   Such phrases as that contained in section 43, to wit: "*   *  *  in all cases in which  the law now provides  for appeals  *  *  *,"  and the provision contained in section  50 to the effect that cases in the Supreme Court "shall thereafter take the same course as is now provided by law," or as that contained in  section 107, "the privileges now secured  by law to the  person claiming to be injured by the  commission of the crime *  *   *," show that the purpose of the legislator  in this respect was to bring into the new  law some of the provisions previously in force on the subject, and to establish a criminal procedure not entirely new, as are the majority of the provisions of  General Orders, No. 58, based  on principles of American law, but mixed, preserving part of the local legislation which is the principle upon which sections 50 and 107 are based.</p>
<p> Therefore the right of the Government to appeal from a. judgment of acquittal being well founded, the motion is overruled without costs.</p>
<p> <em>Torres, Cooper, Willard, Mapa,</em> and <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
