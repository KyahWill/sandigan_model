				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of the Province of Tarlac, convicting the appellant of the crime of attempted rape and sentencing him&nbsp; to two years and five months&nbsp; of <i>prision correccional,</i> accessories and costs.<br><br>The learned trial court found proved the following facts:<br><blockquote>"That on&nbsp; the 10th&nbsp; of&nbsp; January, 1909, at about 10&nbsp; o'clock in the morning, the complainant, Nieves Espinosa, left her house to get some water, carefully locking the door; that on her return, accompanied by a&nbsp; little boy seven&nbsp; years&nbsp; of age, she found the door unfastened and the accused within; that he instantly seized, embraced and kissed her, throwing her to the&nbsp; floor and attempting to ravish her by&nbsp; force; that he was prevented from&nbsp; accomplishing his purpose by the arrival&nbsp; of succor called&nbsp; to the spot&nbsp; by&nbsp; her cries and those of the little boy; that one Sotera Baltazar who heard the cries,&nbsp; hurried at once to the house and saw the accused leap from the&nbsp; house by means of the<i> batalan</i> and run away; that the father of the complainant, Joaquin Espinosa, and oney&nbsp; Ponciano&nbsp; Mallari,&nbsp; who&nbsp; were&nbsp; fishing in the&nbsp; river&nbsp; at the rear of&nbsp; the house,&nbsp; also hurried to her assistance,&nbsp; attracted by the cries of the little boy; that Joaquin Espinosa saw the accused when he leaped from the house and fled; that these facts were&nbsp; placed immediately before the authorities;&nbsp; that there had&nbsp; been no trouble or ill feeling between the parties or their families prior to the time of the assault."</blockquote>The prosecution presented, in support of its charge against the accused, the complainant and her father.&nbsp; There was presented in evidence a torn <i>camiseta,</i> alleged to have been worn&nbsp; by the complainant at the time&nbsp; of the assault and to have been torn by the accused in his efforts to ravish her. <br></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">It&nbsp; should&nbsp; be observed&nbsp; (<i>a</i>) that&nbsp; the crime is alleged&nbsp; to have been committed&nbsp; on Sunday and in the middle&nbsp; of the day;&nbsp; (<i>b</i>)&nbsp; that the accused is alleged&nbsp; to have attempted the violation of the complainant in the presence of a little boy seven years of age; (<i>c</i>)&nbsp; that the&nbsp; house wherein the assault is alleged to have been made is situated in a locality where there were other habitations, being only about forty yards from the house of Sotera Baltazar, who, it is alleged, came instantly&nbsp; at the call of the complainant;&nbsp; (<i>d</i>)&nbsp; that the father and a companion were fishing within forty yards of the&nbsp; house&nbsp; at the&nbsp; time&nbsp; and that,&nbsp; it&nbsp; is asserted by the prosecution, there were a&nbsp; number&nbsp; of other people in close proximity; that they&nbsp; were attracted&nbsp; by the cries of the child and not&nbsp; of the complainant.<br><br>It should be&nbsp; particularly noted&nbsp; <i>(e)</i>&nbsp; that although&nbsp; it is alleged&nbsp; that&nbsp; two disinterested&nbsp; witnesses,&nbsp; namely, Sotera Baltazar and Ponciano Mallari, saw the accused&nbsp; leap from the house&nbsp; and flee, they have not been presented as witnesses for the prosecution; and that the little boy, although presented by the prosecution&nbsp; as&nbsp; a witness&nbsp; against the accused,&nbsp; was not&nbsp; permitted&nbsp; to&nbsp; testify for the reason that, in the judgment of the court, he did not display sufficient intelligence to make him a competent&nbsp; witness.<br><br>It thus appears that the only evidence against the accused is that produced by&nbsp; the complainant and her father. While&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; of this character would&nbsp; generally be sufficient, everything else being equal, nevertheless,&nbsp; under the circumstances of this particular case, we do not regard the case made by it as satisfactory.&nbsp;&nbsp; The failure of the prosecution to&nbsp; present the two disinterested witnesses above- mentioned&nbsp; seriously&nbsp; weakens its&nbsp; case&nbsp; against the accused. The prosecution&nbsp; asserts that it caused subpoenas to be issued for the witnesses in&nbsp; question and&nbsp; that&nbsp; they could not be found.&nbsp; There are found in the record simply two subpoenas, one directed to&nbsp; Ponciano&nbsp; Mallari,&nbsp; dated&nbsp; August 10,&nbsp; 1909, and&nbsp; another&nbsp; to&nbsp; Sotera&nbsp; Baltazar,&nbsp; date&nbsp; the&nbsp; 16th of&nbsp; the same month and year.&nbsp; The trial began on the <i>fifth day of March preceding, at which time the prosecution&nbsp; put in its proofs and closed its case without ever having&nbsp; issued a subpoena for the two witnesses referred to. </i>&nbsp; Nothing more seems to have been&nbsp; done with the case until the&nbsp; 20th of August, 1909,&nbsp; when the accused began his defence.&nbsp; It was just prior to this date that the two subpoenas above-mentioned were issued.&nbsp; As&nbsp; to these, the&nbsp; record does not disclose when they were delivered to the sheriff for service or what effort, if any, he&nbsp; made to find the witnesses; nor does&nbsp; it appear that&nbsp; other or further&nbsp; effort&nbsp; was&nbsp; made&nbsp; at any time.<br><br>We do not believe the evidence&nbsp; warrants the conviction of the accused.&nbsp;&nbsp; (U. S. <i>vs</i>. Obregon,&nbsp; 3 Phil. Rep., 320; U. S.<i> vs. </i> Flores, 6 Phil. Rep., 420.)<br><br>The judgment of conviction&nbsp; is reversed and&nbsp; the accused is ordered forthwith discharged&nbsp; from custody by&nbsp; virtue thereof.&nbsp; Costs <i>de oficio. </i><br><br><i>Arellano, C. J., Mapa,&nbsp; Carson,</i> and <i>Trent, JJ.</i>, concur.<br></div>
