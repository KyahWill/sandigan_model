				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On or about the 5th day of September, 1903, the steamship  <em>Umballa</em> arrived in  the  port of Manila, having on board 50,000 bags  of rice, the property of the  plaintiff. Plaintiff originally  intended to ship  this rice from Singapore to Japan, but afterwards  diverted  it  to Manila. Upon its arrival here the plaintiff's agent made a contract with  the  defendants by the terms of which the defendants agreed to land the rice and store it  in a bonded warehouse. In accordance with  this agreement the  defendants  did land the rice, and stored 40,000 bags of it in a bonded warehouse, but the remaining 10,000 bags they stored in their <em>godown</em> in San Miguel, a warehouse which was not bonded.</p>
<p>The plaintiff sold 4,000 of the  bags of rice here in Manila, which bags  were delivered out of  the bonded  warehouse, and customs duties paid thereon.   He then determined to ship the  rest of  the  rice to Japan, and called upon  the defendants for its delivery to him.  The defendants  delivered to him the rice that was left in the bonded warehouse, and he was enabled to and did reship it without the payment of any customs duties  thereon.  As to the rice in the San Miguel <em>godown</em>, it then transpired  that customs duties had been levied upon this rice by the Government, which duties the defendants had paid without the knowledge or consent of the plaintiff.   The amount thereof was $6,000.55,  United  States  currency.  The  defendants refused to deliver the rice to the plaintiff unless they were repaid this amount of $6,000.55.   The plaintiff, in order to get possession of his rice, was obliged to and did pay under protest to  the defendants this amount, securing the rice and reshipping it to Japan.  He then brought this action to recover the amount so paid by him under protest.</p>
<p>Articles delivered into a bonded warehouse immediately upon arrival in Manila can be shipped out of the country from such  bonded  warehouse without the  payment of duties.   Articles  delivered into a warehouse not bonded must, however, pay duties whether they are shipped out of the country or not.  If Smith, Bell &amp; Co. had complied with their contract, and stored all of  the rice in a bonded warehouse, no duties would have been charged upon any of it, and the payment  of the $6,000.55 would have been avoided.  A  warehouseman is entitled to reimbursement for the expenses  which he incurs in  the performance of his contract.  For expenses which he incurs in violation of his contract he is not entitled to reimbursement.   The payment of  these duties was an expense which  Smith, Bell &amp;  Co.  did not incur  in the  performance of  their contract.  They incurred it by reason  of their violation of the contract, and consequently they were not entitled to reimbursement.</p>
<p>Plaintiff's  principal argument seems to be that this is an action to recover damages for the breach of a contract on the part of the defendants, and that no damages  were proven.   If the plaintiff, instead of paying the defendants the $6,000.55 had refused to pay it and had  brought an action to recover possession of the rice, it is very clear that in such an action the claim of the defendants to a lien upon the property for the payment of this $6,000.55, and the right to retain it until that payment had been made, could not have been sustained, and the plaintiff in such an action would have recovered the possession of the rice without paying this demand.   So if Smith, Bell &amp; Co. had delivered the rice  without  insisting upon  a reimbursement at that time for  this expense, and had afterward brought an action against the plaintiff to recover this  amount, it is clear that they could not have prevailed in such an action. In neither one of these cases would the court have gone into the  question as to whether the plaintiff made or lost money by the reshipment of his rice to Japan.  In both of them  the court would have said that the property belonged to the  plaintiff, and that he had a  right to dispose of it as he saw fit, and that the only right or claim which the defendants had was  a right to be reimbursed for the expenses which  they had incurred in the  performance of their contract, and the  expense which they incurred in the payment, of  the duties not being an expense incurred in the performance of the contract, they would neither be entitled  to recover  the amount in an independent action nor to retain  the rice until they were repaid.   What the rule would  have been had an action been brought for damages for breach of the contract, it is not necessary to decide, for this is not such  an action.</p>
<p>The plaintiff  having been compelled, in  order to get possession of  his property, to pay an. unlawful demand made by  the defendants upon him,  and such  payment having been  made under protest, the latter have in their hands money which does not belong  to them, but which belongs to the plaintiff.  In such cases the law imposes upon them the obligation to repay it.</p>
<p>The judgment of the court  below is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellants  and after the expiration of twenty days judgment should  be entered in accordance herewith and the case  remanded to the court below for execution.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Mapa, Johnson,</em> and  <em>Carson, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
