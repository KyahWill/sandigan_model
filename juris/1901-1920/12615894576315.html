				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>September 22, 1903,  Francisco  Gonzalez,  on his own behalf, and as representative of his sons, Matias and Joaquin Gonzalez, sold to the Oasa Comision de Pilar Corrales, represented by Jose Basa, a country property, in consideration of the  sum of 9,120 pesos, Philippine currency, upon the following conditions:</p>
<p>(<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) That the consideration for the sale was to remain in possession of the purchasing firm as security for a promissory note  executed by the vendors which  matured on the 22d day of December of the same year, but extendible to September 22,1904.</p>
<p>(b) That the sale was to be rescinded if, on the 22d day of  September, 1904, before 12 o'clock noon,  the vendors should return the consideration together with the interest accrued;  the purchasing firm undertaking for  itself or for its successors to reconvey the property in question.</p>
<p>(c) That  the purchasing  firm was to acquire by this <em>contract</em> the right to sign, sell, or  convey the same—that is,  the contract—to any person, natural or juridical, who was to be subrogated to these rights or obligations.</p>
<p>The vendors executed a promissory note in favor of the purchasing  firm, for the sum mentioned^ f*9,120, which was extended on the 22d of March,  1904.  The instrument was signed  by the vendors.  The note at the date of the complaint was in the possession of the International Banking Corporation, by which this action  for its enforcement was brought.</p>
<p>The action brought by the plaintiffs has  two objects, (1) that  of  freeing themselves  from the debt for which they executed the note, and  (2) that of discharging the lien upon the property, the sale to  the Casa Comision de Pilar Corrales by the performance  of the resolutory condition, to which the sale was subjected.</p>
<p>The efficacy of the two actions depends upon  the payment into court of the P9,120, the  debt acknowledged in the note, and the price received for the sale of the property as appears from a notarial instrument executed to this end.</p>
<p>The International Banking Corporation is a creditor and should receive the payment of the debt as the holder of the documents upon which it had made a loan of P2,120, as an operation of discount.</p>
<p>The International Banking  Corporation  also  appears on the books of the register of property as the purchaser of the property  which was sold subject to the right of repurchase, and  therefore  upon  it devolves the  duty of executing the deed of resale.   The books of registry show that this corporation is now in possession of this property by virtue of the power of transfer and conveyance established in the deed of sale.   As to whether or not such a transfer of right as that provided for  in the deed in question was or was not made, or whether it was or was not lawful, is a question which can only interest the original purchaser and the person or persons  appearing as subsequent transferees, but it is of no importance to the plaintiffs who have a clear right of action to enforce a reconveyance against any person in possession of the property, recognizing,  as does the International Banking Corporation, the stipulated resolutory condition of repurchase.</p>
<p>The judgment of the court below  is therefore correct, and it is hereby affirmed, with the costs of this instance to be paid by the appellant.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Mapa,  Carson,</em> and  <em>Willard, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
