				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, denying&nbsp; the appellant's petition for the writ of permanent&nbsp; injunction to restrain and prohibit the Collector of Customs from interfering with the exportation of rice from Manila to Hongkong.<br><br>The only questions presented&nbsp; by this appeal are:&nbsp; (1) Whether or not Act No. 2869 of&nbsp; the Philippine Legislature was in full force and effect on the&nbsp; 6th day of August, 1919; and (2) whether or not said Act is constitutional. Said Act No. 2869 was approved on July 30,&nbsp; 1919, and reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"SECTION 1. The&nbsp; Governor-General is hereby authorized to prohibit, with the consent of the Council of State, by proclamation&nbsp; and subject to such rules as he may publish, the exportation of rice&nbsp; or palay, except to the United States, whenever in his judgment&nbsp; the public interest may require it.<br><br>"SEC. 2. Upon&nbsp; the express or implicit approval of this Act by the President of the United States, as provided in the Act of Congress approved on August twenty-ninth, nineteen hundred and sixteen, entitled 'An Act to declare the purpose of the people of the United States as to the future political&nbsp; status of&nbsp; the people of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippine Islands, and to provide a more autonomous government for&nbsp; those Islands,' the Governor-General shall so announce forthwith, by means of a proclamation, and this&nbsp; Act shall take&nbsp; effect on the date of such proclamation."</blockquote>The appellant contends that said Act was not in full force and effect at the time of the trial of this cause (August 6, 1919) because (1) the President of the United States had not approved it, and (2) the Governor-General had not, by proclamation, announced that the President had approved it. It appears&nbsp; that&nbsp; on the 6th day of August, 1919, the Governor-General, by a proclamation, declared that said Act was in full force and effect and,&nbsp; with the&nbsp; consent of the Council of State, prohibited "the exportation&nbsp; of&nbsp; any rice from the Philippine Islands to&nbsp; any&nbsp; country except the United States."&nbsp; (See proclamation No.&nbsp; 14, 17 Off.&nbsp; Gaz., 1174.)<br><br>When that proclamation was made, however, the President of the United States had not&nbsp; yet approved&nbsp; said Act (No. 2869)&nbsp; either expressly&nbsp; or implicitly.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; view of the provisions of section 2 of said Act the&nbsp; question arises as to whether that&nbsp; proclamation could be legally made before such approval;&nbsp; in&nbsp; other&nbsp; words,&nbsp; could said Act be made effective before its express or implicit approval by the President of the United States?&nbsp; The Attorney-General, on behalf of the appellee, maintains the affirmative, and argues as follows:<br><blockquote>"From&nbsp; a reading of the&nbsp; section of law above quoted (sec. 2),&nbsp; it is evident that, in passing the Act under consideration, the Philippine Legislature was&nbsp; under the impression that its approval by the&nbsp; President of the United States was required by the provisions of the&nbsp; Jones Law.&nbsp; It transpired, however, that the Chief of the Bureau of Insular Affairs, the official representative of the President of the United States in matters relating&nbsp; to the Government of the Philippine Islands, held that such approval&nbsp; was not necessary.&nbsp; Such being the case, it is submitted that, as a matter of law, there has been a substantial compliance with the conditions prescribed by section 2 of the Act."</blockquote>The alleged action or ruling of the Chief of the Bureau of Insular Affairs with reference to the approval of the Act in question by the President of the United States does not appear of record in this&nbsp; case.&nbsp; But an&nbsp; examination of the provisions of the Act of Congress&nbsp; of August 29, 1916 (the Jones Law) really shows that the approval by the President of Act No. 2869 is perhaps not necessary, under the said Act of Congress (the Jones Law).&nbsp; The only acts of the Philippine Legislature which, under the Jones Law, appear to require the approval of the&nbsp; President&nbsp; of the&nbsp; United States are:&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; Those having reference to "land of the public domain, timber, and mining; (2) tariff acts&nbsp; or acts amendatory to the tariff of the&nbsp; Philippine Islands;&nbsp; (3) acts affecting immigration; and (4) acts affecting the currency or coinage laws of the Philippine Islands"&nbsp; (sees. 9 and 10, Jones Law).&nbsp; The Act here in question (No. 2869) does not belong to any&nbsp; of these&nbsp; classes.<br><br>It being evident that the main purpose and intent of the Philippine Legislature in enacting Act No. 2869 was to authorize the Governor-General, by proclamation, to prohibit the exportation&nbsp; of rice or&nbsp; palay, and the approval by the President being unnecessary, under the Jones Law, to carry that purpose into effect, we are of the opinion and so decide that said Act became effective when it was so proclaimed by the Governor-General on the 6th day of August, 1919. The appellant further contends that the Act in question is unconstitutional because&nbsp; it attempts to&nbsp; regulate commerce with foreign nations.&nbsp;&nbsp; Counsel&nbsp; alleges, but does not argue, that the trial court "erred in holding that the Government of the Philippine Islands has&nbsp; authority to regulate commerce with foreign nations," and in "holding that Congress may delegate to the Philippine Government power to regulate commerce with foreign nations."&nbsp; In answer&nbsp; to this contention of the appellant it is sufficient to cite our decision in the case of the United States <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Bull (15 Phil.,&nbsp; 7, 30), wherein we expressly held that the Philippine Government has, by delegation from&nbsp; Congress, the power&nbsp; "to regulate commerce between foreign nations and the ports of the territory."&nbsp; <br><blockquote>"The power to regulate foreign commerce is vested in Congress, and by virtue of its power to&nbsp; govern&nbsp; the territory belonging to the&nbsp; United States, it may regulate foreign commerce with&nbsp; such&nbsp; territory. It&nbsp; may do this directly,&nbsp; or indirectly through a&nbsp; legislative&nbsp; body created by it, to which its power in this respect is delegated."</blockquote>For the foregoing reasons the judgment appealed from should be and is hereby affirmed, with costs.&nbsp; So&nbsp; ordered.<br><br><i>Mapa, C. J., Araullo, Malcolm, Avancena</i>, and <i>Villamor, JJ., </i>concur.</div>
