				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is an appeal from a judgment rendered in the course of interpleader 
proceedings, adjudicating a controversy between several claimants to the 
proceeds of a judgment rendered in favor of the defendant Crisanto Lichauco 
against the defendant Chu Chan Chac.</p>
<p>After a careful review of the whole record we find nothing therein which 
would justify us in disturbing the findings of fact by the trial judge. But it 
is necessary, for the proper disposition of the contentions of counsel on this 
appeal, to add a further finding, to the effect that at the time when these 
proceedings were had in the court below, an appeal was pending from the judgment 
in favor of Antonio Flor Mata, though by special order of the court execution 
thereon was not stayed pending the appeal.</p>
<p>Accepting the findings of the trial judge as correct, the only real question 
raised on this appeal relates to the preference given by the trial judge to the 
claim of Antonio Flor Mata over that of Clara Lichauco.</p>
<p>Antonio Flor Mata claims by virtue of a judgment rendered in his favor 
against Crisanto Lichauco on October 6, 1910, for P8,465.42 of which there 
remains unsatisfied the amount of P7,243.88. From this judgment an appeal was 
still pending at the time when the interpleader proceedings were had in the 
court below, but, by special order of the court, execution on the judgment was 
not stayed pending the appeal.</p>
<p>Clara Lichauco, who is the aunt of Crisanto Lichauco, claims by virtue of a 
judgment for P17,666.60, rendered in favor of herself and her husband against 
Crisanto Lichauco on February 2, 1911.</p>
<p>Under the doctrine laid down in the case of Peterson <em>vs.</em> Newberry (6 
Phil. Rep., 260), there can be no question that Mata, whose judgment bears date 
of October 6,1910, having duly asserted his claim thereto, has a preference in 
the distribution of his judgment debtor's funds over Clara Lichauco whose 
judgment bears date of February 6, 1911, unless it be held that the right of 
preference does not exist in favor of Mata because of the appeal from his 
judgment.</p>
<p>We are of opinion that, both on reason and authority, Mata's right of 
preference should be secured to him notwithstanding the appeal; though of course 
the decree for the distribution of the funds should be so formulated that the 
amount to which he is entitled under his judgment will not be definitely turned 
over to him until and unless his judgment is affirmed on appeal; and the decree 
should further provide for the disposition of the amount thus retained, in the 
event that his judgment should be reversed in whole or in part.</p>
<p>Two substantial objections have been advanced to our ruling in this 
regard.</p>
<p>In the first place it is contended that the statutory authority for the 
preference in favor of Mata's judgment must be found in the provisions of 
article 1924 of the code, and that this article secures the preference to 
sentencias firmes onlyâ€”that is to say, to judgments which are final in the sense 
that no appeal lies therefrom. It must not be forgotten however that both the 
classification and the incidents of judgments, orders and decrees have been 
largely modified under the new Code of Civil Procedure, which is drawn in large 
part from American and English precedents, so that it is necessary to look 
rather to the spirit than the letter of the technical legal terminology used in 
the Spanish code, when rules of law couched in the legal phrasing of that code 
are made applicable to the judgments, orders or decrees mentioned in the 
other.</p>
<p>Section 144 of Act No. 190 provides that in certain cases the perfecting of a 
bill of exceptions does not have the effect of staying execution upon the 
judgment from which the appeal is perfected. No recourse lies from the order of 
the court which secures this result, and it follows that when such an order is 
issued, the judgment creditor has the right to the immediate execution of his 
judgment, or in other words to have immediate recourse to the property of the 
judgment debtor for the recovery of the amount of the judgment. Until and unless 
the time allowed for the perfecting of a bill of exceptions has expired without 
an appeal being taken, such a judgment is not a sentencia firme in the strictly 
technical sense of the word as used in Spanish legal terminology. The limitation 
of preferences by the Spanish legislator to <em>sentencias firmes,</em> as 
distinguished from <em>sentencias</em> generally, would appear to be founded on 
the fact that the right to share in the distribution of the funds of the debtor 
could not logically accrue to the judgment creditor until and unless he has 
secured the right of immediate recourse to the funds in course of distribution, 
and speaking broadly, it was by virtue of a <em>sentencia firme</em> that the 
judgment creditor secured this right to have immediate recourse to the judgment 
debtor's property.</p>
<p>The peculiar quality of <em>sentencias firmes</em> on which this preference 
rests having been impressed upon judgments under the new Code of Civil Procedure 
upon which execution is not stayed, the preference given to the former class of 
judgments must be held to be impressed in like manner on the latter class of 
judgments. We conclude therefore, without much hesitation, that where the new 
code of procedure provides for judgments which give to the judgment creditor the 
right of immediate recourse to the judgment debtor's property, such judgments 
come within the purview of the provisions of article 1924 of the Civil Code 
securing preference to <em>sentencias firmes.</em> In other words, a judgment 
upon which execution has not been stayed, under the provisions of section 144 of 
Act No. 190, is entitled to the preference provided for in article 1924 of the 
Civil Code.</p>
<p>The second objection to our ruling in this case seems to be based on the 
theory sometimes advanced in the United States that upon an appeal, the judgment 
of the lower court is merged in that of the superior court, and that as a result 
any preference incident to the former judgment is necessarily lost and destroyed 
thereby. We think, however, that the better doctrine, supported by the great 
weight of authority in the United States is that the lien of a judgment is not 
necessarily destroyed by the perfecting of an appeal therefrom.</p>
<p>Thus Black on Judgments (vol. I, par. 473) lays down the doctrine as follows, 
and supports the text with numerous citations of authority: "It is generally 
held that the lien of a judgment is not discharged by an appeal being taken, but 
merely suspended; nor is the judgment on appeal a discharge of the lien of the 
judgment below. 'Even if there be a new judgment (e. g., of affirmance on 
appeal), this does not necessarily destroy the lien which the law has given, for 
it is competent for the law to keep the lien in existence, although a new 
judgment be predicated on the first.' And where a decree is reversed in part and 
affirmed as to the residue, the reversal in part does not destroy the lien of so 
much of the decree as is unreversed."<br><br>In the case of Thompson's 
Administrator <em>vs.</em> Chapman's Administrator (83 Va., 215) the court said: 
"It is familiar doctrine, that where a decree is reversed in part, and affirmed 
in part, the reversal does not destroy the lien of so much of the decree as is 
unreversed or affirmed."</p>
<p>In the case of Curtis vs. Root (28 111., 367), it was held that "an appeal 
does not vacate the lien of the judgment, it only suspends its execution. A 
judgment during appeal not only holds its lien, but will extend it over property 
acquired pending the appeal."</p>
<p>In the case of Planters Bank <em>vs.</em> Calvit (3 Smedes and Marshall, 
Miss., 143), it was held, quoting the syllabus, that "judgment is but a security 
for a debt, and the payment of the debt is the object of the lien. Lien of 
judgment arises by mere implication of law; and although a new judgment is 
predicated on the first, this does not necessarily destroy the lien which the 
law has given, for it is competent for the law to keep the lien in 
existence."</p>
<p>In discussing this case, Chief Justice Starkey said: "To me it seems a 
contradiction that the judgment of affirmance, the act which declares the 
judgment was regular, and constituted a perfect lien from the time it was 
rendered in the circuit court, should be considered as the act which destroys 
the validity of the lien. <em>Affirmed</em> means to ratify or confirm, and not 
to destroy. Still it is said, this must be the effect, because the original 
judgment is satisfied, or merged or extinguished by the new judgment. Now I 
maintain that the first judgment is neither satisfied, merged, nor extinguished, 
by the new judgment of affirmance."</p>
<p>See also Hardee <em>vs.</em> Stovall (1 Ga., 92); Dewey <em>vs.</em> Latson 
(6 Cal., 130); Moore <em>vs. </em>Rittenhouse (15 Ohio St., 310).</p>
<p>It is true that in a few states it has been held that where a judgment has 
been superseded on error, the judgment of the inferior court is merged in that 
of the superior court, and the lien of the former is destroyed by the suing out 
of the writ of error and the giving of bond with surety (Campbell vs. Spence, 4 
Ala., 943); but we think that in this jurisdiction the general doctrine as above 
set forth correctly sets forth the rule which should prevail under our Code of 
Civil Procedure.<br><br>The judgment of the trial court correctly declares a 
preference in favor of Mata's judgment, but the trial judge seems to have 
overlooked the fact that this judgment was at that time pending on appeal and 
subject to modification or reversal. Provision should have been made either for 
the retention of a sufficient part of the funds in the hands of the clerk, 
pending the determination of the appeal on Mata's judgment, or the filing of a 
satisfactory refunding bond in the event of modification or reversal of that 
judgment on appeal.<br><br>The judgment appealed from is therefore affirmed, 
with costs against the appellant; but upon the return of the record to the court 
below, the proper orders will be entered as above indicated, with a view to 
securing the rights of the parties in the event of the reversal or modification 
of Mata's judgment.<br><br><em>Arellano, C. J., Trent </em>and <em>Araullo, 
JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em>Moreland, J.,</em> concurs in the result.<br></p></div>
