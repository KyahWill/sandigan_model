				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE, VS. CANDIDO REPOLLO ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.

				<BR><STRONG>COOPER, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The defendants, Candido Repollo, Manuel Repollo, Julian  Repollo,  and Bruno  Dolor,  are charged with the murder of  Proceso Vallesteros, committed on the night of the 16th of May, 1902, and  each has been sentenced to the penalty of death.  From this sentence they have appealed.</p>
<p>On the 23d day of December, 1902, after the cause had been  transferred to this court,  the defendants  presented a motion for a new trial, alleging that  they were entitled to the benefits of the amnesty proclamation issued by the President of the United States on the 4th day of July, 1902, and in support  of their application presented this  covirt certain affidavits made by each of them.</p>
<p>The affidavits of Manuel Repollo states that on the date of the killing of  the deceased lie was  a member of the Katipunan, and also one of the councilors of the barrio of Han Manuel; that the defendants Candido Repollo, Julian Repollo,  and  Bruno Dolor also accompanied  him on the night in  question, as  well as several individuals and soldiers armed with bolos under the command of one Agustin Alejo.</p>
<p>That on the night of  the 17th of December,  upon the arrival of the American troops, Agustin Alejo, captain of insurrectos, came to his house and told him to call the soldiers together for the purpose of seizing Proceso Vallesteros; that in view of Alejo's rank in the insurgent forces he was obliged to obey his orders.   That the captain said, "Let us go,"  and he followed with his  soldiers and  eight individuals armed with bolos, going to the house of Proceso Vallesteros;  that  when  they arrived at  the foot of the staircase of the house of the deceased, the captain, who remained outside  of the  lot, commanded them to order Proceso  Vallesteros to come down stairs; that he came down, and the captain then ordered him to take Vallesteros outside,  but  that  the  deceased  refused to follow.   That they informed the captain, and he said, "Kill him," and the three1 soldiers and the eight individuals armed with bolos killed him.  That they killed the deceased because the captain  (Alejo) said he was a spy  of the  Americans, and was the party who had indicated the  place of the barrio where the insurrectos were  located.   That by  order of Captain Alejo the body was dragged out into the street, and that the captain  then said, "Now you can go, but take care that nobody hears of what's happened, because if it reaches my knowledge that I'm prosecuted for having killed this individual I'll kill you also."</p>
<p>The affidavits of the defendants Candido  Repollo and Bruno Dolor are substantially to the  same  effect, each of them stating  that he was  a member of the Katipunan Society and admitting their  connection with  the murder of the deceased  and stating  the killing as mentioned by Manuel Repollo.  Candido Repollo stated  that he is a brother of Manuel Repollo, and Bruno Dolor declared that Agustin Alejo, the captain, was executed by the Americans in the pueblo of  Binalonan,</p>
<p>It was shown at the trial below that the defendants came to the house of the deceased and commanded him to come down stairs, and that upon doing so they stabbed him with their  bolos at the foot of the ladder,  after  which they dragged the body into the street where they left it.  It does not appear from the record that any ill feeling was known to exist between  them, nor is  there any motive for the killing of the deceased other than the  fact that it is stated he was a spy of the  Americans.  There is a strong probability of the killing being of a political character, resulting from internal political feuds or dissensions among the Filipinos during the insurrection.</p>
<p>While  this motion for  a new trial is not  based  upon strictly newly discovered evidence, yet it is  based  upon testimony which was not material  at the time of the trial in the court below, but has become of vital importance to the defendants by reason of the amnesty proclamation of the President.</p>
<p>This case is very similar to  the case of the United States vs.  Manuel Repollo,  Candido Repollo, Bruno Dolor, and Florencio Nicolas,[1 ] in  which we  have  decided that the defendants, under the provisions of section 42 of General Orders, No. 58, should  be granted a new trial, and for the reasons stated'in the opinion  in that case we set aside the judgment, grant  a new trial to the defendants, and remand the case to the Court of First Instance for a new trial, with costs <em>de oficio</em>.</p>
<em>Torres, Mapa,</em> and <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
