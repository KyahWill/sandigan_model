				<BR><STRONG>TRENT, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The questions  involved in this appeal are (1) the ownership of a small parcel of rice land situated in the Province of Leyte, and (2)  the products  of  the  same since  1904. The trial  court  found the plaintiff to be the  owner  of a part of the land described in his complaint and entitled to receive the products therefrom, amounting to P175.  The defendant appealed.</p>
<p>For the  purpose of  establishing his title,  the plaintiff presented a  certified  copy  of  a  possessory information obtained  in 1897 and  duly registered  the following year, and also the testimony of himself and one other witness to the effect that the plaintiff had been  for more than twenty years prior to 1904 in  possession of the land in question. On the other hand, three witnesses, including the defendant, testified that the defendant  is now and  has been  in  possession of a part of the  land described  in the complaint since  the  year 1890, and  that the other  part is  possessed by one Epifanio  Blancaflor.  The  defendant also presented a notarial document in which it appears that he purchased from  Tiburcio, Felipe,  Placido, and Paulino  Cirera the land claimed by him.</p>
<p>While it  cannot be said that a possessory information, although  duly  registered, which was  obtained  in  1897, is conclusive either as to ownership or possession,  yet, in this case, the possessory information presented by the plaintiff, taken  in connection with the oral testimony presented by him, shows  clearly that he is the real owner of that part of the land sought to be recovered which is now in possession of the defendant.  It is  true  that  the defendant claimed that he purchased this land in 1890 from the above-named parties and that in support of this claim he presented the notarial document which was  executed on April  30,  1910 (some ten days before the institution of this action).  The defendant testified that this notarial document was executed at the time  he  made the purchase in 1890 and that this is the same identical document which he received at that time, while the  document shows upon its face and also from the notary's certificate that it was executed on April 30, 1910. So the defendant's testimony in reference to having received this document in 1890 cannot possibly be true.  The defense attempted to explain this point by trying to show  that this notarial document is a copy of the private document executed in favor of the  defendant in that year.  The old document, if it existed, was  not  presented, neither was  there any attempt made to present the same.   The record  shows conclusively that the  execution of this notarial document was made for the sole  purpose of trying  to defeat the  plaintiff, and that the defendant never purchased any part of this land.</p>
<p>CounseI for the  defendant,  in his printed brief,  insists that the trial court erred in admitting the certified copy of the possessory  information presented by the plaintiff, and bases this contention upon the provisions of section 284 of the Code of Civil Procedure.   This section treats of original writings and provides that there can be no evidence of the contents of a writing other than the writing itself, except in certain cases, one of these cases being when the original is a  record or  other document in the custody of a public official.  The  document presented by the plaintiff is a copy of the possessory information  taken from  the property registry and duly certified by the registrar of deeds.  And furthermore,  his objection, which was raised for the first time on appeal, comes too late.</p>
<p>It  was also contended that the trial court  erred in rendering judgment against the defendant for the products of that portion of  the land which he has occupied since 1904. We  think  this  contention  is well founded.   The plaintiff, prior to 1904, had been in possession of this land cultivating it almost every year for a period of more than  twenty years. But it appears that  about the latter part of 1903 he ceased to cultivate this land and  that the defendant entered into possession of part of the same and has continued in the use and occupation  of that part up to the present time.  The plaintiff has paid very little attention to this land since that year.  So little  that he did not know at the time this case was tried that one Blancaflor was in possession of a part of the land sought  to be recovered by him.  All of this land is occupied by the defendant and Blancaflor,  but it does not appear how much is occupied by each one.  The plaintiff testified that when he cultivated all of the land he produced some 80 to 100 <em>cavanes</em> of <em>palay</em> annually.  Another witness testified that palay since 1904 has sold for from two pesos to two and one-half pesos per cavan.  There is nothing in the record to show what portion of the crop should belong to the landlord and what portion to the  occupant, neither does the record show with any degree of certainty how much of the 2.2625 hectares  in the entire piece is in possession  of the defendant.  The testimony presented by the plaintiff is so indefinite and uncertain that a money judgment for the unlawful use and occupation of the land by the defendant cannot be sustained.</p>
<p>Therefore, the judgment appealed from  should be  and hereby is modified by disallowing  recovery for the products of the land.  As thus modified, the same is affirmed without costs.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Mapa, Johnson,</em> and <em>Carson, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
