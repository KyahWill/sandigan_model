				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Plaintiffs claiming a right of way across the lands of the defendant allege 
that it has been and is being obstructed by him by the erection of fences, which 
compel them to make a sharp turn near the boundary of his land, and to cross his 
land on a line parallel with and a little to the north of the ancient right of 
way. The evidence of record, read together with the excellent and manifestly 
fair and unbiased report of the commissioner appointed by the trial court, 
clearly establishes the existence of the ancient right of way as set forth in 
the complaint, and leaves no room for doubt that the defendant, for his own 
convenience and without the consent of the plaintiffs, has and is obstructing 
the ancient right of way by fencing it off and thus compelling the plaintiffs to 
use another and less convenient means of passage across his land. Plaintiffs' 
evidence and the commissioner's report tend very strongly to maintain a finding 
that the new right of way is not much less convenient and commodious than the 
old one, defendant's object in making the change being merely to move the road a 
little farther away from his house. The commissioner suggests that the principal 
objection to the new right of way could be overcome by making the turn from the 
old road into the new one at an angle not quite so sharp as that in actual use, 
and his clear and comprehensive report would appear to sustain his contentions. 
But it must be remembered that this is not a question of laying out a new road, 
in which questions of relative convenience to the public and the land owners 
whose property is taken for the public use may properly be taken into 
consideration. The question here submitted is whether the defendant is or is not 
obstructing an ancient right of way as alleged in the complaint; and the 
allegations of the complaint having been established in a proper action, the 
plaintiffs' right to relief cannot be defeated by proof that defendant has 
furnished a new right of way, nearly but not quite as convenient and commodious 
as the old one. Such evidence would be of much importance if plaintiffs had 
undertaken to establish their claim of damages, but since there is no competent 
proof in the record in support of their allegations as to damages it can have no 
controlling influence in the disposition of the real issues involved on this 
appeal.
<p>We are of opinion that the trial judge correctly held that the record 
sustains the plaintiffs' claim of a right of way as indicated by the arrows 
marked number 1 on the plan of the land submitted by the commissioner and filed 
with the record. We think however that the form of the judgment entered by him 
must be modified. He directed merely that this road "be opened for the public 
use" and by inference imposed upon the defendant the duty of so doing. But there 
is nothing in the record which would justify a finding that the defendant is 
charged with a duty to maintain or construct a road across his land. So far as 
the record discloses his only obligation in regard to this right of way over his 
land is a negative one, that is to say, not to obstruct or hinder the free 
passage over it of any persons entitled to make use of it. While the prayer of 
the complaint does not clearly indicate the relief sought by the plaintiffs, we 
think that it may fairly be construed as a prayer for a permanent injunction, 
and as that is the relief to which the plaintiffs are entitled upon the facts 
alleged and proven, the trial court should have granted a permanent injunction 
prohibiting the defendant from obstructing, by the maintenance of fences or 
otherwise, the plaintiffs' passage over the ancient right of way, which the 
trial court found to be in a direct line as indicated by the arrows marked No. 1 
on the commissioner's plan.</p>
<p>Let judgment be entered reversing the judgment entered in the court below, 
without costs to either party.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Moreland, Trent,</em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.,</em> 
concur.<br></p></div>
