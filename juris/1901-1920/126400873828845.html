<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MORELAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This case is closely connected  with the case of Faustino Cabacungan <em>vs.</em> Pedro Barut and another, No. 6284,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> just decided by this court, wherein there was  an application for the probate of an alleged last will  and testament of the same person the probate of whose will is involved in this suit.</p>
<p>This appeal arises out of an application on the part of Pedro Barut to probate the last will and testament of Maria Salomon, deceased.  It is alleged in the petition for probate that Maria Salomon died on the 7th day of November, 1908, in the pueblo  of Sinait,  Ilocos Sur, leaving a  last will and testament bearing date March 2, 1907.   Severo Agayan, Timotea Inoselda, Catalino Ragasa, and A. M.  Jimenez are alleged  to  have  been witnesses  to the  execution thereof. By the terms  of said will Pedro Barut received the larger part of decedent's property.</p>
<p>The original will appears on page 3 of the record and is in the  Ilocano dialect.  Its  translation  into  Spanish appears at page 11.  After  disposing of her property the testatrix revoked all former wills by her made.  She also stated in said will that being unable to read or write, the same had been read to her by Ciriaco Concepcion and Timotea Inoselda and that she had instructed Severo Agayan to sign her name to it as testatrix.</p>
<p>The probate of the will was contested  and opposed by a number of the relatives of the deceased on various grounds, among  them that  a  later will had been executed by the deceased.  The will referred to as being a later will is the one involved in case No. 6284 already referred to.  Proceedings for the probate of this later will were pending at the time.  The evidence of the proponents and of the opponents was taken by the court in  both cases  for the  purpose of considering them together.</p>
<p>In  the case before us the learned probate court found that the will was not  entitled to probate upon  the  sole ground  that the handwriting  of the person who it is alleged signed the  name of the testatrix to the will for and on her behalf looked more like the handwriting of one of the other witnesses  to the will than that of the person whose handwriting it was alleged to be.   We  do  not believe  that the mere dissimilarity  in writing thus mentioned by the court is sufficient to overcome the uncontradicted testimony of all the  witnesses to  the will that the signature of the testatrix was written by Severo  Agayan at her request and in her presence and in the presence of all of the  witnesses to the will.  It is immaterial who writes the name of the testatrix  provided it is written  at her request  and in her presence and in the presence of all the witnesses to the execution of the will.</p>
<p>The court seems, by  inference at least,  to have had in mind  that  under the law relating to  the execution of a will it is necessary  that the person who signs the name of the testatrix must afterwards sign his own name;  and that, in  view of the fact that, in the case at bar, the name signed below that of the testatrix as the person who signed her name, being,  from its appearance, not the same handwriting as that constituting the name of the testatrix, the will is accordingly invalid,  such fact indicating  that the person who signed the name  of the testatrix failed to sign his own.   We do  not believe that this  contention can be sustained.  Section 618 of the Code of Civil Procedure reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"No will,  except as provided in the  preceding section, shall be valid to pass any estate, real or personal, nor charge or affect the same,  unless it be in writing and signed by the testator,  or by the testator's name written  by some other person in his presence,  and  by his express direction, and attested and subscribed by three or more credible witnesses in the  presence of the testator and of each other.  *  *  *"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is  the important part of the section under the terms of which  the court holds that the person  who signs the name of the testator for him  must also sign  his own name. The remainder of the section reads:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The attestation  shall state the fact  that the testator signed the will,  or caused  it to be signed  by some  other person, at his express direction,  in  the  presence  of  three witnesses, and that they attested and subscribed  it in his presence  and  in  the presence of each other.  But the absence of such form of attestation shall not render the will invalid if it is proven that the will was in fact signed and attested as in this section provided."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From these provisions  it  is entirely clear that,  with respect to the <em>validity</em> of the will, it is unimportant whether the person who writes the name of the testatrix signs his own or not.  The important thing is that it clearly appears that the name of the  testatrix was signed at her express direction  in the presence of three  witnesses and that they attested and subscribed it in her presence and in the presence of each  other.  That is all  the statute requires.  It may be wise as a practical matter that the  one who signs the testator's name signs also his own; but that is not essential to the <em>validity </em> of the will.   Whether one person or another signed  the name  of the  testatrix in this case is absolutely unimportant so far as the validity of her will is concerned.  The plain wording of the statute shows that the requirement laid down by the trial  court,  if it did lay it down, is absolutely unnecessary under the law; and the reasons underlying  the provisions of the statute relating to the execution of wills do not in any sense require such a provision.   From the standpoint  of language  it is an  impossibility to draw from the words of the law the  inference that the person who signs the name of the testator must sign his own name also.  The law requires only three witnesses to a will, not four.</p>
<p>Nor is such requirement found in any other branch of the law.  The name of  a person who is unable to write may be signed by another by express direction to any instrument known  to the law.   There is no necessity whatever, so  far as  the  validity of the instrument  is concerned, for  the person who writes the name of the principal in the document to sign  his own name also.  As a matter  of policy it may be wise that he do so inasmuch as it would give such intimation as would enable a person proving the document to demonstrate more readily the execution by the  principal.  But as a matter of essential validity of the document, it is unnecessary.   The main thing to be established in the execution of the will is the signature of the testator.   If that signature is proved, whether it be written by himself or by another at his request, it is none the  less valid, and the fact of such signature can be proved as perfectly and as  completely when the person signing for the  principal omits to sign his own name as it  can when  he  actually signs.  To hold a will invalid for the  lack of the  signature of the person signing the name of the principal is, in the particular case, a complete abrogation  of the law of wills, as it  rejects and destroys a will which the statute expressly declares is valid.</p>
<p>There have been cited three cases which it is  alleged are in opposition to the doctrine which we have herein laid down. They are <em>Ex parte</em> Santiago (4 Phil. Rep., 692), Ex parte Arcenas (4 Phil. Rep., 700), and Guison <em>vs.</em>  Concepcion (5 Phil. Rep., 551).  Not  one of  these  cases is in point. The headnote in the case last  above stated gives an indication of what all of the cases are and the question involved in each one of them.  It says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The testatrix was not able to sign her name to the will, and she requested another person to sign it for her.  Instead of writing her name he wrote his own upon the will.  Held, That the will was not duly executed."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All of the above  cases are  precisely  of  this  character. Every one of them  was a  case in which the  person who signed the will for the testator wrote his own  name to  the will instead  of 'writing that of the testator,  so that  the testator's name  nowhere appeared attached to the will as the one who executed it.  The case of  <em>Ex parte</em> Arcenas contains the  following paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Where  a testator does not  know how, or is unable  for any reason, to sign the will himself, it shall be signed in  the following manner: 'John Doe, by the testator, Richard Roe;' or in this form: 'By the testator.  John  Doe, Richard Roe.' All this must be written by the witness  signing  at the  request of the testator."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only question for decision in that case,  as we have before stated, was presented by the fact that the person who was authorized  to sign the name of  the testator to  the will actually failed to sign such name but instead signed <i>his own</i> thereto.  The decision in  that case related only to that question.</p>
<p>Aside from the presentation of an alleged  subsequent will the contestants in this case have set forth no reason whatever why the will involved  in the  present litigation should not be probated.  The  due  and legal execution of the will by the testatrix is clearly established by the proofs in this case.  Upon the facts, therefore, the will must  be probated. As to the defense of a subsequent will, that is resolved in case No. 6284 of which we have already spoken.  We there held that said later will was not  the will of the deceased.</p>
<p>The judgment of the probate court must be and is hereby reversed and that court is directed to enter  an  order in  the usual form probating the will involved in this litigation and to proceed with such probate in accordance with law.</p>

  CONCURRING
</div>
<p><strong>TORRES, J.:</strong></p>
<p>The undersigned agrees and admits that section 618  of the. Code of Civil Procedure does not expressly require that, when the testator or testatrix  is unable or does not know how to sign, the person who, in the presence and under the express direction  of either of them, writes in the  name  of the said testator or testatrix must also sign his own name thereto, it being sufficient for the validity of  the will that the said person so requested  to sign for the testator  or testatrix write the name of either in  his own  handwriting.</p>
<p>Since this court began to decide cases with regard to the form, conditions and validity of wills executed in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, never has the specific point  just above mentioned been brought into question.  Now for the first time it is  affirmed in the majority opinion, written by the learned and distinguished Hon. Justice Moreland, that, not being required by the said code, the  signature of  the name of the person who, at the request of the testator or testatrix, writes the name of either of the latter to the will executed, is not necessary.</p>
<p>Various and considerable in number have been the decisions rendered by this court in which, as will be seen further on, upon applying the said section 618 of the Code of Civil Procedure and requiring its  observance in  cases  where the testator or testatrix is unable or does not know how  to sign his or her  name, expressly prescribe the practical method of complying with the provisions of the law on the subject.   Among  these decisions several were written by various justices of this court, some of whom are no longer on this bench, as they have ceased  to hold such position.</p>
<p>Paragraph 2  of the  syllabus  of case No. 2002, <em>Ex parte</em> Delfin Santiago,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> concerning the probate  of a will,  reads  as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"<em>Wills, authentication of</em>. Where a will is not signed by a testator but by some other person in his presence and by his direction, such other person should affix the name of the testator thereto, and it is not sufficient that he sign his own name for and instead of the name of the testator."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paragraph 1 of the syllabus of case No.  1708, <em>Ex parte</em> Arcenas,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> in the matter of the probate of a will, states:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"1. <em>Wills, requisites of; Civil Code, article repealed</em>.—Article 695 of the Civil Code was repealed by section 618 of the Code of  Civil Procedure; consequently where a testator is unable to sign his name, the person signing at his  request must write  at the bottom of the will  the full name of the testator  in the latter's presence, and by his express direction, and then sign his own name in full."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the  syllabus of  decision No. 2586,  Tomas Guison <em>vs.</em> Maria Concepcion,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> the following statements appear:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"<em>Wills; inability to sign; signature by another.</em>—The testatrix was not able to sign her name to the will, and she requested another person to sign it for her.  Held,  That the will was not duly executed.   (Following <em>Ex parte</em> Arcenas et ah, No. 1708, August 24,  1905;  <em>Ex parte </em>Santiago, No. 2002, August 18, 1905.)"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following syllabus precedes decision No. 3907:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"<em>Execution of wills</em>.—Where it appears in a will that the testator has stated that by reason of his inability to sign his name he requested one of the three witnesses present to do so, and that as a matter of fact, the said witness wrote the name and surname of  the testator who, stating that the instrument executed by him contained his last will, put the sign of the  cross between his said name  and surname, all of  which details are set forth in a note which the witnesses forthwith subscribed in the presence of the testator and of each other, said  will may be probated.</p>
  <p>"When the essential requisites  of section 618 of the Code of Civil Procedure for the execution and validity of a will have been complied with, the fact that the witness who was requested to sign the name of the testator, omitted to state the words 'by request of................the testator,' when writing with his own hand the  name and surname of the said testator, and the fact that said witness subscribed his name together with the other witnesses and not below the name of the testator,  does not constitute a defect nor  invalidate the said will."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following statement appears in the syllabus of case No. 4132, in the matter of the will of Maria Siason:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The recital of the name of the testator as written below the will at his  request  serves as a  signature by  a  third person."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moreover, among the  grounds given  as a  basis for this same decision, the following appears:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"In sustaining this form of signature, this court does not intend to qualify the decisions in <em>Ex parte</em> Santiago (4 Phil. Rep., 692), <em>Ex  parte</em> Arcenas, above quoted, or in Abaya vs.  Zalamero.   In the Arcenas case the court pointed out the correct formula for a signature which ought to be followed, but did not mean to exclude  any other  form  substantially equivalent."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the syllabus of decision No.  4454,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <em>Ex parte</em> Ondevilla et al., the following appears:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The testatrix was unable to sign her will with her own hand and requested another person to sign for her in her presence.   This the latter did, first  writing the name of the testatrix and signing his own name below: Held, Thet the signature  of the testatrix so affixed is sufficient and a will thus executed is admissible to probate.  (<em>Ex  parte</em> Arcenas, 4 Phil.  Rep., 700.)"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The syllabus of decision No. 5149<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> sets forth that: "The legality of a will is not affected by the insertion, supposed to have been made subsequently, of another name before that of the testator when such  name may be treated as nonexistent without affecting its validity."<br><br>
  Among the conclusions  contained  in  this  last decision the following is found:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Although the said words 'For Simplicia de los Santos be considered as inserted  subsequently,  which we neither affirm nor deny, because a specific determination either way is unnecessary,  in  our opinion the signature for the testatrix placed outside of  the body of  the will contains the name of the testatrix as if she signed the will, and also the signature of the witness who, at her request, wrote the name of the testatrix and signed for  her, affirming the truth of this fact, attested by the other witnesses then present.   And  this fully complies with the  provisions of section  618 of the Act."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It  is true that in none of the decisions above quoted was the rule established that the person who, at the request of the testator or testatrix,  signed the latter's or the former's name and surname to the will must affix his own signature; but it is no less true that, in prescribing the method in which the provisions of the said section 618 were  to be complied with, it was stated that, in order that a will so executed might be admitted to probate, it was  an indispensable requisite that  the  person  requested  to  sign in  place of the testator or testatrix, should write the latter's or the former's name and surname at the foot of the will in the presence and under the  direction of  either, as the case  might be, and should afterwards sign the instrument with his own  name and surname.</p>
<p>The statement that the person who writes the name and surname of the testator or testatrix at the foot of the will should likewise affix his  own signature thereto, name and surname, though it be considered to be neither a rule nor a requisite necessary to follow for the  admission of the will to probate, yet it is unquestionable that, in inserting this last  above-mentioned detail in the aforesaid decisions,  it was  deemed to be a complement and integral part of the required conditions for the fulfillment of the provisions of the law.</p>
<p>It is indisputable that the latter does not require the said subscription and signature of the person requested to affix to the will the name of the testator or testatrix who is not able to sign; but by stating  in the decisions  hereinabove quoted that the name and surname of the said person should be affixed by him, no act prohibited by law was recommended or  suggested, nor may such a detail  be  understood  to be contrary or opposed to the plain provisions thereof.</p>
<p>In the preceding decision itself, it is recognized to be convenient and even prudent to require that the person requested to write the name of  the testator or  testatrix in the will also sign the instrument with his  own name and surname. This statement induces us to believe that, in behalf of the inhabitants of this country and for the sake of an upright administration  of justice, it should be maintained that such a signature must appear  in the will, since  no harm could accrue to anyone thereby and, on the contrary, it would serve as a guarantee of the certainty of the act performed and also might eliminate some possible  cause of controversy between  the  interested parties.</p>
<p>The undersigned feels it his duty to admit that, though convinced of the complete repeal of article 695 of the Civil Code and,  while  he concedes that, in the examination and qualification of a will  for the purpose of its probate, one has but to abide by the provisions of  the said section 618 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the sole  law applicable in the matter, yet, perhaps imbued with and strongly impelled by a traditional conception of the laws  which he has known since his youth, relative to the form of execution of testaments, he believed it to be a very natural and common sense requisite that the signature, with his  own name and surname, of the person requested to write  in the will the name and surname of the testator or  testatrix should form a part of the provisions  of the aforementioned  section  618. He undoubtedly thought, perhaps mistakenly, that such a requisite of the signature of the person  before referred to—a requisite deemed to be convenient and prudent in the majority opinion—formed a part of the provisions of the law, since the latter contains nothing  that  prohibits it.  The aforementioned different decisions were drawn  up  in  the form in which they appear, and signed without dissent by all the justices of the court on various dates.  None of them hesitated to sign the decisions, notwithstanding that it was expressly held  therein that the person above mentioned should, besides  writing in the will the name and surname of  the testator  or testatrix, also sign the  said instrument with his own name and surname.</p>
<p>Without being understood to criticise  the provision contained in the said section 618 of the Code of Civil Procedure, it will not be superfluous to mention that the system adopted in this section is the same as was in vogue under the former laws  that governed in  these  Islands, with  respect to witnesses who were not able or did not  know how to sign their  testimony given  in  criminal or civil  cases, in  which event any person at all might write the name and surname of the witness who was unable or did not  know how to sign, at the foot of his deposition, where a cross was then drawn, and, this done,  it was considered that the instrument had been signed by the witness, though it is true that all these formalities were performed before the judge and the clerk or  secretary of the court, which  thereupon certified that such procedure was had in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>The difference is that in the will, pursuant to section 618 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the person who writes the name and surname of the testator or testatrix does so by the order and express direction of the one  or of the other, and this fact must be recorded in the will; but in the matter of the signature of a deposition, the witness, who could not or  did not know how to sign, did not need to  designate anyone to write the  deponent's name and surname,  and in practice the witness merely made a cross beside his name and surname, written by whomever it be.</p>
<p>With regard to the execution of wills in accordance with the provisions of previous statutes, among them those of the Civil Code, the person or witness requested by the testator or testatrix who was not able or did not know how to sign, authenticated  the will by signing it with his own name and surname, preceded by the words "at the request of the testator or testatrix."  Paragraph 2 of article 6§5 of the Civil  Code contains the following  provisions bearing on the subject:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Should the testator declare that he does  not know how, or is  not able  to sign, one of the attesting witnesses or another person shall do so for him at his request, the notary certifying thereto.  This shall also be done if any one of the witnesses can not sign."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that, prior to the  enforcement in this country in 1901 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the procedure prescribed by the old laws with  respect  to the signing of  a will  by  a testator or testatrix who did not know how or  who could not sign, consisted in that  the person  appointed  and requested by the testator or testatrix to sign in  his or her stead, such fact being recorded in the will,  merely affixed at the bottom of the  will and after the words "at the request of the testator," his own name, surname and paraph.</p>
<p>It is not at all strange that the attorneys of this country, imbued with and inspired by these legal provisions, which, it may be said, are traditional to them in the ideas they have formed of the existing  laws in the matter of procedure in compliance therewith as regards the execution  and signing of a will,  should have  believed that, after the name and surname of the testator or testatrix had been written at the foot of the will, the person  who signed the  instrument in the manner mentioned should likewise sign the same with his own name and surname.</p>
<p>If in various decisions, it has been  indicated that the person who, under the express direction of the testator or testatrix,  wrote  the latter's or the former's name  and surname, should also sign the will with his own name and surname,  and  since this suggestion  is  not opposed  or contrary to the law, the undersigned is of opinion that it      ought  not  to be modified or amended, but that, on  the contrary, it should be maintained as a requisite established by the jurisprudence  of  this court, inasmuch as such a requisite is not.contrary to law, to public order, or to good custom, is in consonance with a tradition of this country, does not prejudice the testator  nor  those interested in an inheritance,  and,  on  the  contrary,  constitutes another guarantee of the truth and authenticity of the  letters with which  the name and surname of the testator  or testatrix are written,  in  accordance  with his or  her desire as  expressed in the will.</p>
<p>Even though the requisites referred to were not recognized in jurisprudence and were unsupported by any legal doctrine whatever, yet, since it is in harmony with the juridical usages  and customs observed in this country, it  ought, in the humble opinion of the writer, to be maintained for the benefit  of the inhabitants of the Islands and for the sake of a good administration of justice, because it is not a question of a dangerous innovation or of one prejudicial to the public good, but a matter of the observance  of a convenient, if not a necessary detail, introduced by the jurisprudence of the courts and which in the present case has filled a vacancy left by  the positive written law.</p>
The foregoing considerations, which perhaps have not the support of better premises, but, in the opinion of the undersigned,  are conducive to the realization of the purposes of justice, have impelled him to believe that the  proposition should be enforced that the witness requested or invited by the testator or testatrix to write his or her name to the will, should also subscribe the instrument by signing thereto his own name and surname; and therefore, with  the proper finding  in this sense, and a  reversal of the  judgment appealed from,  that the  court below should be  ordered  to proceed with the  probate of the will of the decedent, Maria Salomon, in  accordance with the law.<br>
