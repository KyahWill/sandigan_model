				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This action was instituted to secure the judicial partition of the tract of land described in the complaint.&nbsp; Plaintiffs insist&nbsp; that they, together with the defendant, are the descendants&nbsp; of a common ancestor, the original&nbsp; owner of the land; that on his death, about forty years ago, defendant's father took possession of this&nbsp; tract of land and continued in possession&nbsp; until his death in&nbsp; the year 1897; that since that date&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; has been in&nbsp; possession;&nbsp; but&nbsp; that by right&nbsp; of inheritance, they are entitled&nbsp; to share&nbsp; with the defendant&nbsp; in&nbsp; the ownership and profits&nbsp; of this property, and in this action to have a decree&nbsp; for the judicial partition of the common&nbsp; property and&nbsp; an&nbsp; assignment&nbsp; of&nbsp; their respective shares in accordance with&nbsp; the laws of&nbsp; descent.<br><br>Defendant&nbsp; denies the allegations of the complaint,&nbsp; and alleges that she, together with her husband, acquired the tract in question by purchase from the owners of the various parcels of land of which it is composed.<br><br>Plaintiffs' evidence is&nbsp; limited to&nbsp; the oral testimony of a few&nbsp; interested witnesses speaking&nbsp; largely&nbsp; from hearsay, who testify that&nbsp; they have&nbsp; always understood&nbsp; that the land in question was originally the&nbsp; property of one Maria Bautista, the wife of Pablo Bautista; that on her death it fell into the hands of her husband, Pablo Calavia, who died some forty years ago; that on&nbsp; his death, one of his sons, the father of the defendant, took possession&nbsp; and continued in possession&nbsp; until he died 'in&nbsp; February,&nbsp; 1897,&nbsp; when his daughter, the defendant, took possession; and that since that time she has retained exclusive possession, and denied the right of the plaintiffs to share in the fruits and profits.<br><br>We do not think that&nbsp; this vague and uncertain oral testimony as to the alleged mode by which the defendant acquired possession of the land in question is sufficient to overcome the definite and positive testimony of defendant that she acquired it in her lifetime&nbsp; by purchase from the owners of the three separate parcels&nbsp; of which it is&nbsp; made up; and even if it were granted that this land did at one time belong to the common ancestor, we think that the plaintiffs' own evidence casts such a doubt upon their claim to share therein by right of inheritance,&nbsp; that&nbsp; judgment was properly rendered in the&nbsp; court below in&nbsp; favor of&nbsp; the defendant&nbsp; in possession.<br><br>Testifying on their own&nbsp; behalf,&nbsp; some of the plaintiffs admit that after the death of Pablo Calavia, a part of his property was&nbsp; divided among&nbsp; his heirs, though they&nbsp; insist that the land in question was not included in the extrajudicial partition made at that time.&nbsp; No attempt is made to account for the omission of this&nbsp; particular tract of&nbsp; land from the terms of the partition agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp; Plaintiffs also admit that until this action was instituted, no&nbsp; steps had ever been taken by themselves or their predecessors in interest to establish their claim to an interest in this property, from which they allege they have been excluded for some forty years. While&nbsp; there is&nbsp; nothing in the&nbsp; record which would justify us in&nbsp; doubting the sincerity and good faith of these plaintiffs in&nbsp; their claim of an interest in this property, we agree&nbsp; with the trial judge that&nbsp; the evidence&nbsp; on which they base their claim is wholly insufficient to overcome the presumption in favor of the&nbsp; right&nbsp; of possession and ownership of the defendant, arising from the admitted fact that an&nbsp; extra judicial&nbsp; partition of&nbsp; a part,&nbsp; at&nbsp; least,&nbsp; of the&nbsp; property of the&nbsp; common&nbsp; ancestor&nbsp; was made after his death, and&nbsp; the uninterrupted possession for so many years of this particular part of the land by the defendant and her&nbsp; father.<br><br>The judgment of the lower court in favor of&nbsp; the defendant&nbsp; should, therefore, be&nbsp; affirmed with the&nbsp; costs of this instance against the&nbsp; appellants.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; so ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J., Mapa, Moreland, </i>and <i>Trent, JJ.</i>, concur.<br></div>
