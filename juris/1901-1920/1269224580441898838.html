				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment of conviction.<p>After 8 o'clock of the evening of May 29, 1910, Francisca Pestano, having&nbsp; prepared supper, left her house, situated in the barrio of Tarug, pueblo of Mogpog,&nbsp; Island of Marinduque, Province&nbsp; of Tayabas,&nbsp; in search of her husband, Januario Mantala, going in the direction of the house of Pedro Mantala, a brother of her husband, but before reaching it she heard her husband calling her and telling her to come and help him.&nbsp;&nbsp; On approaching, she found him at a distance of some 10&nbsp; <em>brazas </em>from the road&nbsp; in a place&nbsp; about 200 <em>brazas</em> from her house.&nbsp; He was wounded and lying at full length on the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp; Francisca thereupon screamed and&nbsp; called the said Pedro&nbsp; Mantala telling him that his brother Januario was&nbsp; dying.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pedro then&nbsp; came up&nbsp; and, when informed of what had occurred,&nbsp; went to&nbsp; bring the <em>teniente </em>of&nbsp; the barrio.&nbsp;&nbsp; Francisca&nbsp; Pestano&nbsp; testified&nbsp; that, when she asked&nbsp; her husband who&nbsp; had wounded him,&nbsp; he replied that it was Dalmacio&nbsp; Paz and Agripina Mantala, the former&nbsp; with&nbsp; a&nbsp; lance and&nbsp; the latter with&nbsp; a&nbsp; penknife, while he&nbsp; was entering their house to&nbsp; notify them that, in accordance with an agreement, they must remove the house erected on&nbsp; his&nbsp; land&nbsp; and which he&nbsp; had given&nbsp; to them&nbsp; in exchange for two hogs; that while her husband was being conveyed&nbsp; from Tarug to the town, he died on the road leading through the barrio of Bulo; and that the place where her husband was found in the rice field was not less than 100<em> brazas</em>&nbsp; from the house where the fight occurred.</p><p>The post-mortem&nbsp; examination of the body of Januario Mantala, made&nbsp; by the municipal sanitary inspector, on the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; morning of the following day, the 30th of May, disclosed that it bore four wounds&nbsp; a deep wound between the second and third lower ribs of the right side; another below the last rib of the same side,&nbsp; through which a part of the intestines protruded; the third, penetrating the stomach; and the fourth, in&nbsp; the right knee.&nbsp; These wounds&nbsp; were diagnosed&nbsp; as&nbsp; having been&nbsp; infl'cted with&nbsp; a sharp-pointed instrument, such as a bolo; the first three were pronounced dangerous, the second and third being necessarily&nbsp; mortal.</p><p>On account&nbsp; of the foregoing facts, the crime having been reported to the authorities, the provincial fiscal, on&nbsp; August 9, 1910, filed an information in the Court of First Instance of Marinduque, Tayabas, charging the&nbsp; said Dalmacio Paz and Agripina&nbsp; Mantala with the&nbsp; crime of homicide;&nbsp; the court, upon the evidence adduced, rendered judgment, on the same date, sentencing each of the defendants to&nbsp; the penalty of six years and one day&nbsp; of prision mayor, to the corresponding&nbsp; accessory penalties,&nbsp; to&nbsp; indemnify,&nbsp; jointly or severally, the heirs of the deceased Januario Mantaia in the sum of P1,000, and each to pay one-half of, the costs. From this judgment the defendants appealed.</p><p>The facts above related, fully&nbsp; proved&nbsp; in&nbsp; the trial of this cause, constitute unquestionably the crime of homicide,&nbsp; provided for and&nbsp; punished by article 404 of the Penal Code, inasmuch as the evidence shows beyond all doubt that&nbsp; Januario&nbsp; Mantala died a few hours after&nbsp; he had received four wounds, two of them of a mortal nature, in the right side and in the stomach, which caused a protrusion of the intestines; that the same were inflicted as the result of a quarrel&nbsp; that the deceased had&nbsp; with his brother-in-law, the said Dalmacio Paz, in the latter's&nbsp; house; and that none of the specific circumstances enumerated in article 403 of the Penal Code were present in the commission of the crime.</p><p>At the trial it was satisfactorily proven that Dalmacio Paz was solely responsible&nbsp; for the grave&nbsp; wounds that&nbsp; occasioned the death&nbsp; of Januario&nbsp; Mantala.&nbsp; The accused testified that he was obliged, in&nbsp; self-defense, to inflict the wounds on&nbsp; the&nbsp; said&nbsp; Mantala,&nbsp; who had assaulted&nbsp; him,&nbsp; in order to save himself from certain death.&nbsp; This confession of the defendant Paz involves an exculpatory allegation, not invalidated&nbsp; by any act or proof&nbsp; to the contrary; on the other hand, his&nbsp; plea is corroborated by the conduct of the deceased who, greatly biased in mind against his sister and his brother-in-law, the defendants, entered their house on the night&nbsp; of the crime, armed with a bolo,&nbsp; while they were asleep;&nbsp; after violently entering the said house,&nbsp; without the permission of its occupants,&nbsp; he&nbsp; insulted the latter,&nbsp; ill treated&nbsp; his own&nbsp; sister, the wife of the owner of the house, and assaulted the latter&nbsp; with the bolo; and,&nbsp; during the struggle, he received&nbsp; the wounds that caused his death.</p><p>The record shows&nbsp; no&nbsp; circumstantial evidence&nbsp; whatever to weaken the said plea of self-defense; and, as there were no eye-witnesses to the occurrence, there is no reason for refusing to admit the said plea.</p><p>If Januario Mantala,&nbsp; impelled&nbsp; by resentment,&nbsp; had not entered the house of the defendants, provided with a weapon, and insulted them and provoked the quarrel, and if he had not thus attacked his own sister and his brother-in-law with the intent to do them&nbsp; bodily harm, the defendant would not have been obliged to resist the assault and to act in defense of his person and his&nbsp; rights; hence it must&nbsp; be held that the commission&nbsp; of the homicide was attended by the&nbsp; circumstance of&nbsp; complete exemption&nbsp; from criminal&nbsp; liability, inasmuch as&nbsp; the&nbsp; said&nbsp; Dalmacio Paz&nbsp; acted&nbsp; in self-defense against an unlawful assault made upon him within his&nbsp; own house, without any provocation whatever on his part; therefore the accused, Paz, in&nbsp; defending himself while stretched out on the floor, with his assailant on top of&nbsp; him holding him by the throat, had rational need of the means he employed to free himself from&nbsp; imminent danger; the method which he used to defend himself was all the more&nbsp; reasonable since at that&nbsp; moment, except&nbsp; his wife, Agripina Mantala&nbsp; who was slightly wounded and frightened, no one else was&nbsp; present to assist him.&nbsp; The two brothers of the deceased were in the vicinity of the house, but instead of coming to the rescue, they took to their heels.</p><p>The present case therefore, falls within the&nbsp; provisions of paragraph 4 of article 8 of the Penal Code, which provides that he who acts in defense of his person and rights, provided there are&nbsp; attendant the three circumstances therein mentioned, is exempt from criminal&nbsp; liability.</p><p>According to the testimony of the defendants, for several days prior to the occurrence of the facts related,&nbsp; there had been trouble between them and Januario Mantala, notwithstanding their&nbsp; being near relatives,&nbsp; owing to Dalmacio's refusal to accept,&nbsp; because of its dilapidated condition,&nbsp; the house ceded to him in exchange for two hogs; that on Friday, the 27th of May, prior to the day of&nbsp; the occurrence of the crime charged, Januario, finding that the leaves of the coconut trees on his land had been destroyed, became very angry and, without reason, insulted the&nbsp; defendant and his wife notwithstanding that the damage to the trees had not been done by them.</p><p>The testimony of the widow with reference&nbsp; to&nbsp; the statements&nbsp; made by the deceased before he died, and the averment of the justice of the peace that this defendant had confessed to him that she had in self-defense&nbsp; attacked her brother Januario who had ill-treated and wounded her, is not sufficient to&nbsp; support the criminal charge against Agripina Mantala, inasmuch as the widow of the deceased may have been driven to give such testimony through the natural resentment engendered by her&nbsp; husband's death;&nbsp; and even though the&nbsp; deceased may have made ante-mortem statements&nbsp; accusing&nbsp; his&nbsp; own&nbsp; sister&nbsp; of having aided her own husband, it is to be&nbsp; supposed that he may have believed that she did, in the confusion that must have arisen inside of a house that was at&nbsp; most&nbsp; but&nbsp; poorly lighted; besides, when the deceased&nbsp; made such&nbsp; incriminating&nbsp; statements, no one else was present or heard them except the witness. Moreover, the justice of the peace testified that neither the statements of the widow, Francisca Pestano, with&nbsp; reference to the deceased, nor those of the defendants, when brought before him, were&nbsp; taken down&nbsp; in&nbsp; writing.&nbsp; The testimony of the said justice of the peace appears to be contradicted by the defendant, Agripina Mantala, who denied that she had, even in self-defense, attacked her brother, the deceased, and also by the sanitary inspector who examined the wounds of the deceased and positively declared that they had&nbsp; been inflicted with a bolo.&nbsp; There is, in addition, the fact&nbsp; that the defendant, Dalmacio&nbsp; Paz,&nbsp; in&nbsp; his confession, made no statement whatever with regard to his wife's having taken part in&nbsp; the struggle, but, on the contrary, corroborated her testimony to the effect that, as shown by the record, she was&nbsp; ill treated by her brother,&nbsp; the&nbsp; deceased,&nbsp; when&nbsp; she screamed for help on seeing the attack made by the latter upon her husband.</p><p>From all the foregoing, it is apparent that no&nbsp; conclusive proof whatever is&nbsp; afforded by the evidence, to show&nbsp; that the said defendant Agripina took&nbsp; any part in the struggle between her husband and her brother; however, even though she had done so, she would in all respects be exempt from criminal liability, for, in any event, she would have&nbsp; had in her favor the three requisite circumstances enumerated in paragraph 4 of article 8 of the Penal Code, as she would have been in a position&nbsp; identical with that of her husband. It was the deceased who insulted the defendants, provoked the quarrel and with a bolo attacked the latter in their&nbsp; house; so if there were perversity and malicious intent to do injury, it was not on the part of the parties attacked,&nbsp; but on that&nbsp; of the aggressor.</p><p>For the reasons herein before set&nbsp; forth, it is&nbsp; proper, in our opinion, that, with a reversal of the judgment appealed from and the express&nbsp; finding that the&nbsp; defendants are entirely exempt from all liability, Dalmacio Paz and Agripina Mantala should be, and&nbsp; are, hereby acquitted.&nbsp;&nbsp; The costs in both instances&nbsp; shall&nbsp; be assessed <em>de oficio</em>.&nbsp; So ordered.</p><p><em>Mapa, Johnson,&nbsp; Carson,</em> and <em>Moreland, JJ</em>., concur.</p></div>
