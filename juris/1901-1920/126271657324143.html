				G.R. No. 2750, August 22, 1906</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. SANTIAGO ALDOS ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The defendants were positively identified  by Luis Catajay, Teodoro Catajay, and David Cervo, witnesses for the Government, as being among the people who committed the robbery of the three carabaos in question.  The robbers were followed by the Constabulary, and within twenty-four hours, and at the distance of a day's journey, the property was  found near  the residence  of the  defendants.  This evidence is sufficient to convict the defendants of participation in the robbery.</p>
<p>The objections  urged in this court to the sufficiency of the complaint can not avail  the appellants because they were not presented in the court below.  United States <em>vs</em>. Sarabia<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> (3 Off.  Gaz., 403).</p>
<p>The crime committed was <em>robo en cuadrilla</em> and the judgment is modified by imposing upon  Santiago  Aldos the penalty of fourteen  years eight months and  one day imprisonment (<em>cadena  temporal</em>)  and upon the other  appellants nine  years'  imprisonment (<em>prision mayor</em>).   In all other respects the judgment is affirmed with the costs of this instance against the appellants.  At the expiration of ten days judgment should be entered in accordance with this decision and ten days thereafter the case remanded to the court  below  for  execution of  said judgment   So ordered.</p>
<em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Carson, </em>and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
