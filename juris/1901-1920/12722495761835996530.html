				<BR><STRONG>FISHER, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Tarlac, 
dismissing plaintiff's complaint. The suit was filed against certain defendants 
alleged to be unlawfully in possession of a part of the property claimed by 
plaintiff. Affidavits were filed here, after the case was submitted, for the 
purpose of showing that the value of the property in dispute is in excess of 
P10,000.
<p>The record of this case is in such a condition that we are unable to render a 
final judgment, but are compelled to return it to the trial court for further 
action.</p>
<p>Plaintiff contends, and the record shows, that the decision in this case was 
rendered by a judge who did not hear the evidence, and that at the time the 
decision was rendered no transcription had been made of the stenographic notes 
of the testimony of several important witnesses. Under these circumstances, it 
is evident that the trial judge was not in a position to make complete findings. 
While this court has held that it is not necessary that cases should be decided 
by the judge before whom the evidence was taken, if he ceases for any reason to 
exercise judicial authority in the particular court in which the case was tried 
before rendering his decision, and must be decided by the successor of auch 
judge, it is obviously necessary that the judge by whom the decision is rendered 
shall have either heard the witnesses or read the transcript of the stenographic 
record of their testimony. When the trial judge neither hears the witnesses nor 
reads their testimony, his findings and conclusions based upon an examination of 
only a part of the record cannot be accepted as a proper disposition of the 
case. Nor can this defect be remedied by the inclusion of the missing evidence 
in the record brought before this court on appeal. We exercise 
<em>appellate</em> jurisdiction only over cases tried in the Court of First 
Instance. To require us to examine evidence which has not been heard or even 
read by the trial judge, is to require us to do something which the law does not 
authorize. We must, therefore, return the case to the trial court, in order that 
complete and specific findings may be made there upon all the issues of fact 
raised by the pleadings, and that upon such findings the court below may render 
judgment in accordance with its opinion as to the law applicable to the case. It 
will not be necessary, of course,, to retake the evidence.</p>
<p>In cases of this nature, in which an action in ejectment is brought against 
several defendants, each claiming individually the ownership of a certain tract 
of land apparently embraced within the area of the larger tract claimed by 
plaintiff, the trial court should make specific findings upon the evidence, with 
respect to the property claimed by each defendant, should determine whether or 
not it is included within the boundaries of the tract claimed by plaintiff, and 
if the defense of prescription is interposed, the length of time which in the 
opinion of the court the evidence shows that each of the defendants and their 
predecessors in interest have been in possession of the land, and the facts 
tending to show the character of that possession, as being adverse or not.</p>
<p>While it is not strictly necessary for us to say anything more in disposing 
of this appeal, we have deemed it advisable, following the practice adopted in 
other similar cases, to indicate our opinion upon a matter of fundamental 
importance in this litigation. The action being in ejectment, it is incumbent 
upon the plaintiff to show title in himself to the land in question—he cannot 
rely upon the weakness of the title of the defendants. From an examination of 
the documents upon which plaintiff relies, if appears that he contends that the 
original owner of the land in dispute transmitted his title to the persons named 
as grantors in the deed of April 15, 1911 (Exhibit B), who in turn conveyed it 
to plaintiff. It appears, however, from an examination of the deed of April 15, 
1911, that several of the persons purporting to have joined in the conveyance, 
to plaintiff were minors. There is nothing to show that any judicial 
authorization was obtained by the sale of the interests of these minors. As to 
some of them, it appears that an attempt has been made to transfer their 
interests by having their grandmother sign "for myself and my grandchildren." As 
to others a similar attempt to convey their interests was made by their mother. 
As to the interests of these minors, if any, in the land in question, such a 
conveyance is absolutely void. If those minors had any interest in the land in 
question at the time the deed of April 15, 1911, was executed, they still retain 
those interests. At best, therefore, this deed could have produced only a 
community property between plaintiff, as successor to the interests of the 
adults, who signed the deed, and the minors. The plaintiff, so far as the record 
shows, is not, as he asserts, the sole owner of the land—leaving out of 
consideration for the time being the question as to whether any part of it 
belongs to defendants—but merely a cob'wner with the minors, who appear by the 
terms of the deed of April 15, 1911, to have been the owners at that time of an 
undivided interest in the property. We hold that a coowner cannot maintain an 
action in ejectment without joining all other persons interested. Section 114 of 
the Code of Civil Procedure requires that every action must be prosecuted in the 
name of the real party in interest, and that any person who has an interest in 
this subject matter and who is a necessary party to a complete determination of 
the questions involved, should be made a party to the proceeding. The same 
article provides, in its last paragraph, that if any person having an interest 
in the subject of the action, and in obtaining the relief demanded, refuses to 
join as plaintiff with those having a like interest, he may be made a defendant, 
the fact of his interest and refusal to join being stated in the complaint. Were 
the courts to permit an action in ejectment to be maintained by a person owning 
merely an undivided interest in any given tract of land, a judgment in favor of 
the defendant would not be conclusive as against the other coowners not parties 
to the suit, and thus the defendant in possession of the property might be 
harassed by as many succeeding actions of ejectment, as there might be coowners 
of the title asserted against him. The evident purpose of section 114 is to 
prevent the multiplicity of suits by requiring the person asserting a right 
against the defendant to include with him, either as coplaintiffs or as 
codefendants, all persons standing in the same position, so that the whole 
matter in dispute may be determined pnce and for all in one litigation.</p>
<p>We desire to call the attention of counsel, furthermore, to the very 
unsatisfactory condition of the briefs filed in this case. It is the duty of the 
attorney to aid the court by making specific reference to those parts of the 
record upon which they rely for support in their contentions regarding the 
facts. (Rules of the Supreme Court, article 19.) Unless this is done, it is not 
incumbent upon us to explore the record for the purpose of discovering evidence 
upon which to reverse the findings of the trial judge, merely because the 
appellant made a motion for the new trial, and excepted to its denial. The 
presumption is that the findings of the trial court are correct and the burden 
rests upon the appellant to state explicitly wherein the court is believed to 
have erred and to designate specifically, by reference to the page of the 
record, all the evidence upon which he relies to demonstrate his contention. The 
statute does not impose upon us the absolute duty of reviewing the evidence in 
civil cases coming before us by bill of exceptions when a motion for a new trial 
upon the statutory grounds has been made and denied, but merely provides we 
<em>may</em> do so. (Code of Civil Procedure, Section 497, paragraph 2.) The 
pressure of work upon this court is so great that we cannot, in justice to other 
litigants, undertake to make an examination of the voluminous transcript of the 
testimony, unless the attorneys who desire us to make such examination have 
themselves taken the trouble to read the record and brief it in accordance with 
our rules.</p>
<p>The judgment of the court below is set aside, and the case is remanded for 
further proceedings in accordance with this opinion. No costs will be allowed on 
this appeal. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson, Carson, Araullo, Street</em> and 
<em>Avanceña, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Malcolm, J.</em>, concurs in the result.</p></div>
