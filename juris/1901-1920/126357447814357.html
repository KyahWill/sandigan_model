				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>For the purposes of this appeal it may be assumed that the plaintiff and defendant are owners of adjoining tracts of land.   The claim of the plaintiff is  that the defendant, with the permission of the plaintiff,, ten years before the commencement of the action, erected her house upon his land, very near the dividing line between the two properties, and  that  it has since remained there with his permission and consent.  The claim of  the defendant  is that the house stands  upon her own land.</p>
<p>The court below evidently found upon this part of the case in favor of the plaintiff, but ordered judgment  for the defendant on the ground that she had been in possession of the land upon  which her house stands for ten years and had acquired title thereto by prescription.</p>
<p>The plaintiff moved for a new trial on the ground of the insufficiency of the evidence and has brought the case here by bill of exceptions.</p>
<p>The evidence strongly supports the theory  of the court below that, tlie house was built upon the land  of the plaintiff.  The testimony of the defendant herself is almost conclusive upon tliis point.   She stated that during the time she occupied the land where her house stood she had never collected any of the cocoanuts growing on the trees standing thereon, but that during all of that time  the plaintiff has taken 1 hem.   Upon the evidence, judgment should have been  in favor of the plaintiff.</p>
<p>In  applying the statute  of  limitations, the  court  evidently had  in mind the provisions of the present Code of Civil  Procedure found in section 41, which fixes the period of prescription at ten years.   The prescription, however, in this case commenced prior to the enactment  of  the Code of  Civil  Procedure  and  the right of  action  had already accrual to the plaintiff when that code took  effect.  Section 41 is  not applicable because section 38  provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Thin chapter shall not apply to actions already commenced, or to cases wherein the right of action has already accrued; but the statutes in force when the action or right of action accrued shall be applicable to such cases according to the subject of the  action and without regard to the form."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The prescriptive law applicable  to the case is, therefore, that found in the Civil Code.   According to that code, in order to avail herself of the period of ten years  it was necessary for the defendant to  prove that she occupied the premises under color of title.  This, according to the finding of the court below, she did not do, and that finding  is supported by the evidence.</p>
<p>The plaintiff brought  this action not only for  the recovery of the possession of the  land,  but also  for  the recovery of 30 pesos as damages for the destruction by  the defendant of trees  which he had  planted upon the land. The evidence shows that the defendant destroyed these trees and that they were  worth the sum of 30  pesos.  The judgment  of the court below is reversed and  the case remanded to the lower court with instructions to enter judgment for the plaintiff as prayed for in his complaint, with the costs of the first instance.  No costs will be allowed to either party in this court.</p>
<p>After expiration of twenty days let judgment be entered in accordance herewith, and ten days thereafter let the case be remanded to the  court below for proper  action.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Carson,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
