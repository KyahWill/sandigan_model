				G.R. No. 3204, December 17, 1906</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. FLAVIANO SALANATIN (ALIAS ANO), DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This case is here on appeal.   The court has nothing before it except what purports to be the answers given  by the various witnesses, but not  the questions that were put to them, either in their direct or cross examination; which are  followed  by the certificate  of  one who signs himself "interpreter," to the effect that the foregoing is a correct translation of the notes taken  by the court in longhand during the absence of the official stenographer.</p>
<p>Section 32 of General  Orders, No. 58, provides that where tlie testimony and proceedings are taken in shorthand they must be certified to by the official stenographer in order to  be  considered <em>prima facie</em> as a correct  statement of such testimony and proceedings; otherwise the  testimony after  being reduced  to writing must be signed by the witness and the  judge and duly attested  by the  clerk. The testimony in  this case  not being certified  to in either of the above manners, it can not be considered as a correct statement  of  the facts which  this court  is called upon to review.</p>
<p>The judgment of the court below is accordingly set aside from the case remanded for a new trial with direction to that court to outer judgment in accordance with the  testimony introduced, which said  testimony shall be  taken and received in the manner and form prescribed by  law.   Let judgment be entered in  conformity herewith,, without special provision as to costs, and the case  returned to the lower  court forthwith.  So  ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Mapa, Carson,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em>Willard, J.,</em> dissents.</p>
<p><em>Johnson, J.,</em> did not sit in this case.<br>
