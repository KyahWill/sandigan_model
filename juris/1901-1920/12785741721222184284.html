the complaint presented he was duly arrested, arraigned, tried, found guilty and 
sentenced to be imprisoned for a period of 4 years, 2 months and 1 day of 
prision correccional, with the accessory penalties provided for in article 58 of 
the Penal Code, and to pay the costs. From that sentence the defendant appealed 
to this court.
<p>After a careful examination of the evidence brought here, the following facts 
seem to be proved, beyond a reasonable doubt:-</p>
<p>1st:- That in the month of April, 1911, one Nestor Chavez was the owner of a 
oarabao, then about nine months old, which in said month was taken and carried 
away by some person.</p>
<p>2nd:- That in the month of July, 1913, said carabao was found in the 
possession of the defendant.</p>
<p>3rd:- That said carabao was fully identified, by reason of special white 
marks that were found on its head.</p>
<p>4th:- That after the carabao was found in the possession of the defendant and 
Nestor Chavez either had or was about to present a complaint charging him with 
the larceny of said carabao, he, together with two of his friends, went to the 
said Chavez and offered to return the carabao secretly, if the owner would 
promise either not to present the complaint, or to withdraw the one which. he 
had presented.</p>
<p>5th:- That the carabao was worth about P120.00 or 600 pesetas. -</p>
<p>The defendant was sentenced by the Honorable Riohard Campbell, Judge. Judge 
Campbell made the following observations with reference to the character of the 
testimony adduced during the trial of the cause:- He said -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Court, after seeing the witnesses and hearing them testify, and after 
making careful observations as to their conduct on the witness stand, is fully 
oonvinced that both tha defendant and his witnesses gave perjured testimony with 
respect to the manner in whioh the carabao came into his hands. The whole 
transaction from beginning to end, and the circumstances surrounding it, show 
bad faith........</p>
<p>"As has been said above, the Court has every reason to believe that the 
testimony of the defendant and his witnesses, with respect to the "procedencia" 
of the animal, is false in every particular, and that the animal is in fact the 
property of the complaining witness, Nestor Chavez."</p></blockquote>
<p>After a careful examination of the record brought to this court, we are 
persuaded, beyond a reasonable doubt that the reoord fully sustains the 
conclusions of the lower court. The sentence, therefore, of the lower court is 
hereby affirmed, with costs.<br><br><br>It is so ordered.</p>
<p>After the expiration of 10 days from the date hereof, let the judgment be 
entered in accordance herewith, and 10 days thereafter let the record be 
returned to the court from whence it came, for execution.</p></div>
