				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. AGUSTIN LANSAÃ‘GAN, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E CI S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This defendant was charged with the crime of assassination, alleged to have 
been committed as follows: "That the said Agustin Lansangan, on or about the 6th 
day of December, 1913, in the municipality of Concepcion, Province of Tarlac, 
willfully, maliciously, and criminally, with premeditation and treachery, did 
kill one Marcelino Tipay, a child of 7 years of age; contrary to law."
<p>The defendant was duly arrested, arraigned, tried, found guilty of the crime 
of homicide in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Tarlac, and 
sentenced to be imprisoned for a period of fourteen years eight months and one 
day of <em>reclusion temporal,</em> with the accessories of the law, to 
indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P1,000 and to pay the costs. 
From that sentence the defendant appealed to this court. Here the appellant was 
represented by an attorney <em>de officio.</em> The only defense made by the 
appellant is that the proof adduced during the trial of the cause does not 
justify, beyond a reasonable doubt, the conclusions of the lower court.</p>
<p>From an examination of the evidence brought here we find that the following 
facts are sustained beyond a reasonable doubt:</p>
<p>That for a long time before the death of the said Marcelino Tipay, the 
defendant and Maria Bautista, the mother of the deceased, had been living and 
cohabiting together; that a short time before the 6th day of December, 1913, the 
defendant and the said Maria Bautista had a quarrel and the defendant left the 
house where he had been living with Maria Bautista, threatening to kill her or 
some of her children; that a few days after the defendant had left 'the house of 
Maria Bautista, the deceased Marcelino Tipay and one of the other children of 
the said Maria Bautista were playing in the highway on the afternoon of the 6th 
day of December, 1913; that the defendant passed by where the children were 
playing and, for some reason or other, induced the said Marcelino Tipay to 
accompany him in the direction of an estero; that later on the same day, the 
child (Marcelino Tipay) riot having returned home, a search was made for it; 
that late in the evening one of the children met the defendant in the highway or 
road, leaving the estero, and at that time the clothing of the defendant was wet 
up to his waist; that inquiry was made of him concerning the whereabouts of the 
said Marcelino Tipay, whereupon he immediately returned to the <em>estero,</em> 
went into the water and picked up the dead body of the child from the bottom of 
the <em>estero</em> and brought it ashore; that upon an examination of the body 
of the said Marcelino Tipay, it was found that the cervical vertebra had been 
dislocated. Suspicion was at once directed to the said defendant as the person 
who had caused the death of the said Marcelino. Tipay and the next day (the 7th 
of December, 1913) a complaint was presented against him in the court of the 
justice of the peace of the municipality of Conception, Province of Tarlac, and 
a preliminary examination was held by the said justice of the peace, who found 
that there was probable cause to believe that the defendant was guilty of the 
crime and ordered him to be held for trial in the Court of First Instance of 
said province. Later the case was brought to trial in the Court of First 
Instance.</p>
<p>After hearing the evidence the Honorable Julio Llorente, judge, in a 
carefully prepared opinion, in which he makes an extensive summary of the 
evidence adduced during the trial of the cause, reached the conclusion that the 
evidence showed, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant was guilty of the 
crime of homicide. The lower court found that there were no circumstances upon 
which he could qualify the crime as assassination. </p>
<p>The defendant, at the time of the trial, was a man of forty years of age. The 
deceased was a child of seven years of age. The supreme court of Spain has held 
in numerous decisions, and those decisions have been followed by this court, 
that the qualifying circumstance of treachery exists whenever one person employs 
means, methods and forms which insure the execution or commission of the crime 
without any danger arising or resulting to himself from the acts of the person 
attacked. 1 Alcubilla, 444. Decision of the supreme court of Spain of July 13, 
1897; U. S. <em>vs.</em> De Leon (1 Phil. Rep., 163); U. S.<em> vs.</em> Ricafor 
(1 Phil. Rep., 173); U. S. <em>vs.</em> Rubeta (1 Phil. Rep., 331); U. S. 
<em>vs.</em> Abelinde (1 Phil. Rep., 568); U. S. <em>vs.</em> Abaigar (2 PhiL 
Rep., 417); U. S. <em>vs.</em> Santos (2 Phil. Rep., 453); U. S. <em>vs.</em> 
Alvarez (3 Phil. Rep., 24).</p>
<p>The supreme court of Spain has also held (and this court has followed said 
decisions) in considering alevosia as a qualifying circumstance of the crime of 
assassination, that when an adult person illegally attacks a child of tender 
years and causes its death, that he runs no risk whatever of personal injury to 
himself from such attack and that therefore in such a case alevosia should be 
considered as a qualifying circumstance of the crime, and the same should be 
qualified as assassination. In the present case the child was of tender years, 
being but seven years old. Whatever method the defendant employed, in causing 
the death of the deceased, the same was done without any possibility of danger 
resulting to himself from the child. The crime, therefore, in the present case 
should be qualified as that of assassination. Decisions of the supreme court of 
Spain: January 26, 1877 (where the child was 30 months old); October 29, 1879 
(where the child was 11 years old); October 10,1883 (a child of tender years); 
November 15, 1895 (where the child was 3 years old); July 13, 1897 (a young 
child). U. S. <em>vs.</em> Irarion (2 Phil. Rep., 476) ; U. S. <em>vs.</em> De 
Jesus (14 Phil. Rep., 190).</p>
<p>From the record we find no aggravating circumstances accompanying the 
commission of the crime. Considering all of the facts and circumstances, 
however, and the ignorance of the defendant, we are disposed to give him the 
benefit of article 11 of the Penal Code as an extenuating circumstance, and 
impose upon him the minimum penalty provided for the crime of assassination. The 
sentence of the lower court is therefore hereby reversed and it is hereby 
ordered and decreed that a sentence be entered declaring that the defendant is 
guilty of the crime of assassination, with the qualifying circumstance of 
<em>alevosia,</em> and the extenuating circumstance of article 11 of the Penal 
Code, and sentencing the defendant to be imprisoned for a period of twenty years 
of <em>cadena temporal,</em> to suffer the accessory penalties provided for by 
law, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P1,000, and to pay the 
costs.</p>
