				<BR><STRONG>MAPA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is an action to recover a debt due upon a contract executed July  27, 1903, whereby plaintiff  transferred to the defendant  the abaca and coprax business theretofore carried on by him at various places in the Island of Catanduanes, with all the property and rights pertaining to the said business, for the sum of 134,636 pesos and 12 cents, payable  in  Mexican currency or its equivalent in local currency.  Defendant paid at the time of the execution of the contract, on account of the  purchase price, the  sum of 33,659 pesos and 3 cents, promising to pay the balance in three installments of 33,659  pesos and 3 cents each, with interest at the rate of 5 per cent per  annum from the date of the contract.  The first  installment became due July 27,1904.  It was for the recovery of  this first installment that this action was brought in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila.</p>
<p>Defendant demurred to the complaint on  the ground that the court  had no jurisdiction of the subject  of  the action.   The court overruled the  demurrer and defendant refused to and  did not, as a matter of fact, answer plaintiff's complaint.</p>
<p>Judgment having been rendered in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of 33,659 pesos and 3  cents, Mexican currency, equal to 30,052 pesos and 70 centavos, Philippine currency, and interest thereon at the rate of 5 per  cent per annum from July 27,1903, and costs, the defendant duly excepted.</p>
<p>The appellant relies upon  four assignments  of error. The first error  assigned by him is that the court had no jurisdiction  of  the subject of the action.</p>
<p>It is alleged in support of this  contention that' plaintiff and defendant were  residents of the Island of Catanduanes, as would appear, so far as the plaintiff is concerned, from a power of attorney, executed by him to Antonio Vallejo y Valencia and introduced in evidence during the trial.  This power of attorney was executed August 22, 1901.  The instrument in fact contains the statement that plaintiff was a resident of Catanduanes.  Nothing is said, however, either in the power of attorney or in the contract upon which this action is based, as to the residence of the defendant.</p>
<p>The complaint was filed March 10, 1905, and it alleges that both  plaintiff and  defendant were residents  of  the city of Manila.  This allegation was not either generally or specifically  denied by the  defendant, who refused and failed to file an  answer to  the complaint, having merely demurred  thereto.  This allegation, therefore, must be deemed admitted.  The power of attorney above referred to having been executed in August, 1901, does not and can not by itself prove that the parties were not residents of the city of Manila in March, 1905, when the complaint was filed.  The actual residence, and  not that which the parties had four years prior to the filing of the complaint, is the one that should govern the question as to the jurisdiction of the court.</p>
<p>A personal action  like this for the recovery  of a debt may be brought, under section 377 of the Code of Civil Procedure, in the Court of First Instance  of the province where the  plaintiff resides  or in  the province where the defendant  may reside, at  the  election of the plaintiff. Both parties to this  case being residents ,.of the city of Manila, it is apparent that the Court of  First Instance of that city  had jurisdiction to try and  determine this action.</p>
<p>It is further urged in support  of the alleged want of jurisdiction on the part of the  court below, that the parties had mutually designated  in the contract in question the town of Bato, Island of Catanduanes,  as the place where all judicial and  extrajudicial acts necessary under the terms thereof should take place.  Paragraph 9 of the contract  contains in fact a  stipulation to that  effect.  This the appellant claims  amounted to an express submission by the contracting parties to the jurisdiction of the Court of  First Instance of the Province of Albay, in which the town of Bato was located, all other courts  being thereby inhibited from exercising jurisdiction over actions arising under the contract.</p>
<p>We are of the opinion that the designation of the town of Bato made by the parties had no legal force and could not have the effect of depriving the Court of First Instance of Manila of the jurisdiction conferred on it by law.   This would be true even  though it  may  be granted that the parties actually intended to waive the rights of domicile and expressly submit themselves to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance of Albay as contended by  the appellant, all of which it may be said seems to be very doubtful, judging from the vague and uncertain manner in which the designation was made.  The jurisdiction of a court is fixed by law and not by the will of the parties. As  a matter of public policy, parties can only stipulate in regard to that which  is expressly authorized  by law.  Section 377 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides a plain and definite rule for the purpose of determining the jurisdiction of courts according to  the nature  of the action. Neither that section nor any other provision of law, of which we have any knowledge, authorizes  the parties to submit themselves by an express stipulation to the jurisdiction of a particular court to  the exclusion of the court duly vested with such jurisdiction.  We consequently hold that the  agreement between the parties to submit  themselves to the jurisdiction  of the Court of First Instance of Albay, if there was any such agreement, was null and void, in so far as it had for its object to deprive the Court of First Instance of Manila of its own jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Articles 1255 and 1278 of the Civil Code relied upon by the appellant in his brief are not applicable to cases relating to the jurisdiction of  courts.  The  Law  of Procedure and not the Civil Code fixes and defines the jurisdiction of courts.  It is not  true as contended by the appellant that the right which litigants had under the Spanish law to submit themselves to the jurisdiction of a particular court was governed by the provisions of  the Civil Code. Such right was recognized and governed by the provisions of the Law of Procedure and not by the substantive law. The right to  contract, recognized in  the  Civil  Code and referred to by appellant,  has nothing to do with the right to establish and fix the jurisdiction of a court.  This right can  only be  exercised by the  legislative branch of  the Government, the only tme vested with the necessary power to make rules governing  the subject.  In  this connection it may be said that the jurisdiction of a court can not be the subject-matter  of a contract.</p>
<p>The second error assigned by the appellant is that the court erred in fixing in Philippine currency the sum which the appellee should recover, without hearing evidence  as to the relative value of Mexican and Philippine currency.</p>
<p>The amount sought to be recovered in this action, under the terms of the contract, was 33,659 pesos and 3 cents, payable  <em>in Mexican currency</em>,  or its  equivalent in local currency.</p>
<p>In paragraph 4 of the  complaint it  is alleged  thatâ€”</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Under the  terms of the contract the actual amount due from defendant to plaintiff, converted into  Philippine currency, is 28,049 pesos and 19 centavos  *  *  *."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This contention was not denied by the defendant, who, as has been said before, simply demurred to the complaint. Plaintiff's allegation must therefore be deemed  admitted. Consequently  it was not  necessary for the court to hear evidence as to the  relative value of Mexican and Philippine currency.  There is  no dispute between the parties as to  the fact  that  the 33,659 pesos and 3  cents,  Mexican currency, referred to in the contract, were  equal to 28,049 pesos and 19 centavos, Philippine currency, at the time  of the filing of the complaint.</p>
<p>The proof required by section 3 of Act No. 1045, cited by the appellant, should be received only when the parties disagree  as to the relative value of the currency. The court below did not, therefore, err in not hearing evidence upon  this point, even under the assumption that no such evidence was heard in regard thereto, as claimed by the appellant.</p>
<p>The appellant also assigns as error the fact that defendant was given the option to pay the debt either in Mexican or Philippine currency, claiming that the court should have directed payment to be made in the latter currency as required by Act No. 1045.  Assuming that this contention is correct, it  would nevertheless be true that  it did not prejudice any  of his essential rights.   He was rather favored thereby, since he was given an option to pay in whatever currency he might see fit.   It is well known that in the case of an alternative obligation the debtor has the right to choose the method of meeting the obligation unless the creditor has expressly reserved that right to himself. (Art. 1132 of the Civil Code.)</p>
<p>The alleged violation by the court below of the provisions of Act No. 1045 in this particular respect is not, therefore, a sufficient ground for the reversal of the judgment.  Section 503 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that no judgment  shall be reversed for such  error as has not prejudiced  the substantial rights of the excepting party.</p>
<p>The third  error assigned by the appellant is that the court erred in rendering judgment in a sum larger than that sought to be recovered in the complaint.   The prayer of the complaint is for the specific amount of 28,049 pesos and 19 centavos, Philippine currency, and the court in its judgment  ordered the defendant to pay to the plaintiff 30,052 pesos  and 70 centavos, in the same currency.</p>
<p>Section  126 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides in part as  follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The relief granted to the plaintiff, if there be no answer, <em>can not exceed that which he shall have demanded in his complaint. * * *"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The defendant failed to answer.  Under such circumstances plaintiff could not have obtained more than what he had  demanded in  his complaint.  Plaintiff's demand was for the sum of 28,049 pesos and 19 centavos only.  The court had no power to  enter judgment in favor of the plaintiff for 30,052 pesos and 70 centavos.  We hold that this was error on the part of the trial court.  The judgment of the court below should be modified in this respect.</p>
<p>The fourth and last error assigned by the appellant is that the court took into consideration as the basis of its judgment the contract in question,  the same being null and void.  The appellant alleges in support of his contention that the contract did not bear the internal-revenue stamp required by Act No.  1045 of  the Philippine Commission enacted January 27, 1904, and relies particularly upon the provisions of sections 9 and 10 of the act.</p>
<p>Section 9 reads in part as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Every check, draft, note, bond, bill of  exchange,  and every  contract whatsoever  payable  in local  currency *  *  *   shall be presumably subject to the taxes levied <em>in accordance with the provisions of  this act,</em> and the obligation shall rest  upon the drawer  or maker, holder or beneficiary * * *  who claims exemption,  to  prove that he is entitled  to  any of the exemptions <em>provided in this act</em>.  No check, draft, note, bond, bill of  exchange, or any contract whatsoever payable in local  currency shall be exempted from the  payment of the stamp tax provided <em>for in sections six and  seven of this act</em> unless the contract for which exemption is claimed shall be registered with the Collector  of Internal  Revenue  or his deputy before  October first, nineteen hundred and four, and a  certificate be attached thereto by the Collector of Internal Revenue, or his deputy, certifying to the exemption."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under section 10â€”</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Every check, draft, note, bond, bill of exchange, and every contract whatsoever  which is not properly stamped <em>in accordance with the provisions of this act,</em> shall be void. * * *"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The two sections above quoted refer to other provisions of the same Act No. 1045.  Section 9 refers expressly to sections 6 and 7.  Section  9, as well  as section  10, refers to documents which should be stamped in accordance with the provisions of the same act.  These provisions are contained in sections 6 and 7 above referred to, the documents subject to the stamp tax being therein enumerated.</p>
<p>Section 6 provides thatâ€”</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Every  check, note,  draft, bond, bill of exchange, and every contract  whatsoever payable wholly  or in  part in local  currency, <em>and drawn or made  upon or subsequent to October first,  nineteen hundred and four,</em> shall bear upon  its face an internal-revenue stamp or stamps of the face value in Philippine currency  to the amount hereinafter  provided."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This same section in subsections<em> (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), and  (g) </em>enumerates  the exemptions referred to in section 9 above quoted.</p>
<p>Section 7 provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Every transfer of ownership, by indorsement or otherwise, after September thirtieth, nineteen hundred and four, of a check, draft,  note, bond, bill of exchange, or any contract  whatsoever payable  wholly  or in  part in local currency  in  the Philippine  Islands  after the  thirtieth  of, September, nineteen hundred  and  four,  *   *  *  shall be considered a separate and distinct contract,  and as such shall require a stamp or stamps."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems clear from the language of  these two latter sections  that only such contracts payable  in local currency as were made on or after October 1, 1904, are subject to the stamp tax.  The provisions of the section  in question are  very clear and leave no room  for doubt.   Sections  9 and 10  are merely supplementary to sections 6 and  7. They  provide a method for proving the exemption from the stamp tax and a penalty in case of  failure to comply with the provisions of sections 6 and 7.   These latter sections  are  the ones which require  a stamp tax upon all contracts  payable in local currency and declare  what documents shall be subject to such tax.  It  is therefore necessary to construe these sections together with sections 0  and  10 in order to arrive at the proper conclusion.  A full and correct interpretation of the act in question would not be possible if we only consider the two latter sections. They are, as has been said before, merely supplementary to the  preceding sections.</p>
<p>The  contract under consideration was executed July 27, 1903.  Such contract  was not subject to the  stamp tax provided in Act No. 1045.  The penalty of nullity prescribed in section  10 of the act is  not applicable to that contract.  The court,  therefore, committed  no  error in finding that the absence of a revenue stamp did not render the contract void.</p>
<p>The judgment of the court below  is  hereby  affirmed, provided, however, that the plaintiff shall only be entitled to recover from the defendant the sum of 28,049 pesos and 19 centavos, Philippine currency, with  accrued interest thereon from July 27,  1903, until fully paid,  at the rate of 5 per cent per annum, no special order being made as to costs of this appeal.</p>
<p>After the expiration of twenty days from the date hereof let judgment be entered accordingly, and let the case be remanded to the Court of First  Instance for such action as may be proper.  So ordered.</p>
