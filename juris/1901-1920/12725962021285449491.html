				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; was charged with the crime of <span style="font-style: italic;">estafa</span>. The complaint alleged:<br><br><blockquote>"That on October 11,1913, the accused,&nbsp; abusing the office which he then held of president of the municipality of Victoria, Province of Tarlac, received from the&nbsp; Chinaman Tiu Loco the sum of&nbsp; Ti under the obligation to deliver it to the municipal treasurer as&nbsp; a&nbsp; voluntary contribution&nbsp; from the said Chinaman for the construction of the public school of the&nbsp; said&nbsp; municipality;&nbsp; but the&nbsp; accused,&nbsp; instead&nbsp; of so doing, did appropriate to himself the said sum to the prejudice of the municipality&nbsp; of Victoria and, furthermore, did, on October&nbsp; 22,&nbsp; 1914,&nbsp; deny ever&nbsp; having received the said sum from the Chinaman aforementioned."</blockquote><br>Upon said complaint the defendant was&nbsp; duly&nbsp; arrested, arraigned, tried, found guilty of the crime&nbsp; of <span style="font-style: italic;">estafa</span>, and sentenced to be imprisoned for a period of two months and one day of <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor,</span> in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 5 of article 535, and paragraph 1 of article 534 of the Penal Code.&nbsp; He was further sentenced to suffer the accessory penalties of article 61, and&nbsp; to pay the costs. From that sentence the defendant appealed to the Supreme Court.<br><br>In&nbsp; this court the appellant presents&nbsp; a&nbsp; very interesting brief, in which he attempts to show that, considering the proof adduced during the trial of the cause, and&nbsp; the&nbsp; law applicable thereto, he is not guilty of the crime charged.<br><br>The Attorney-General,&nbsp; in a very well-reasoned brief, in which he makes a careful analysis of the proof, reaches the conclusion that the defendant&nbsp; is guilty of the crime&nbsp; charged and should suffer&nbsp; not only the period&nbsp; of imprisonment imposed by&nbsp; the lower court, but also the temporary special disqualification provided for under article&nbsp; 399 of the Penal Code.<br><br>After a careful examination of the evidence, we find that the following facts are proved, beyond a reasonable doubt:<br><ol><br><li>That on the 11th day of October, 1913, and for some time prior thereto, the defendant was the&nbsp; president of the municipality of Victoria, Province of Tarlac.<br><br></li><li>That some time prior to&nbsp; the said&nbsp; 11th day of October, in accordance with the law,&nbsp; the municipal council of the municipality of Victoria authorized the collection of money from&nbsp; the citizens of the said&nbsp; municipality&nbsp; for the&nbsp; purpose of constructing a public school building; that said resolution had been properly&nbsp; affirmed by the proper&nbsp; authorities.<br><br></li><li>That a committee was duly appointed for the&nbsp; purpose of making said collections from the people of said&nbsp; municipality ; that the defendant, as&nbsp; municipal president, was&nbsp; one of the members of said committee.<br><br></li><li>That on the 11th day of&nbsp; October, 1913, the defendant went&nbsp; to the store or&nbsp; tienda of one Tiu&nbsp; Loco and solicited from&nbsp; him a contribution to be used in the construction of the said public school; that the said Tiu Loco&nbsp; paid to&nbsp; the defendant the sum of P4 to be used for said purpose.<br><br></li><li>That the defendant,&nbsp; as president of the municipality of Victoria, and as a member of the committee duly&nbsp; appointed for the purpose of making said&nbsp; collections&nbsp; for&nbsp; the purpose&nbsp; above indicated, after having received&nbsp; the said sum of P4 from Tiu Loco, to be used in the construction of a public school, failed and&nbsp; refused to deliver the same to the proper authorities, and later&nbsp; denied that he had ever received said sum for said purpose, or for any other.<br><br></li><li>That while the fact is not important for the decision of the present case, the record shows that a number of the other members of the committee,&nbsp; including the vice-president&nbsp; of&nbsp; said&nbsp; municipality, had made similar&nbsp; collections and had appropriated various sums to their own use, and had been arrested, tried, and convicted of the crime&nbsp; of estafa.<br></li></ol>It seems to us to be clear, when the foregoing facts are taken into consideration&nbsp; with&nbsp; paragraph 5 of article 535 of the Penal Code, in its relation with paragraph 1 of article 534, that the defendant&nbsp; is guilty of the crime of estafa. (U. S. <i>vs.</i> Dacuycuy,&nbsp; 9 Phil. Rep., 84; U. S. <i>vs.</i> Dacuycuy, 9 Phil. Rep., 747; U.&nbsp; S. <i>vs.</i> Gallego, 10 Phil. Rep., 222.)<br><br>The Attorney-General recommends that the sentence of the lower court be modified&nbsp; and that the defendant be punished with the penalty of temporary special disqualification, in accordance with the provisions of article 399 of the Penal Code.&nbsp; No authority&nbsp; is cited in support of said recommendation.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Attorney-General, however, supports his recommendation with the following argument:<br><br><blockquote>"Before beginning&nbsp; to collect the voluntary contributions for the construction&nbsp; of&nbsp; the school, the municipal council, after obtaining&nbsp; permission from the&nbsp; Governor-General, passed a resolution whereby it authorized several persons, among whom was included the municipal president of Victoria, by reason of his office, to take up these contributions; and it cannot be doubted&nbsp; that when the&nbsp; Chinaman Tiu Loco delivered the sum of V4 to the&nbsp; accused, he did so in consideration of the latter's office which permitted the said accused to ask contributions from private parties for the said school.&nbsp; We are convinced that if the accused, Jose Villarta, had not been municipal&nbsp; president, an&nbsp; office that entitled him to the respect and consideration of his towns men, he would not have obtained from Tiu Loco that sum of (P4,&nbsp; as&nbsp; shown by the said&nbsp; Chinaman's attitude before the court&nbsp; in&nbsp; always employing the words "municipal president" when referring to the accused, Villarta.&nbsp; It is likewise no less certain that, in consideration of the office held by the accused, the Chinaman Tiu Loco did not require of him a receipt for the said sum&nbsp; of P4.&nbsp; The lower&nbsp; court, therefore,&nbsp; should have sentenced the accused, in addition to the penalty it imposed upon him,&nbsp; to that between temporary&nbsp; special disqualification in its maximum degree and perpetual&nbsp; special disqualification"</blockquote><br>With that&nbsp; argument of the Attorney-General we are inclined&nbsp; to&nbsp; agree.&nbsp; The collection&nbsp; of the&nbsp; funds referred&nbsp; to above was authorized by the Governor-General.&nbsp; The defendant, as president of the municipality, without&nbsp; doubt by virtue of the fact that he was president, was authorized to make collections.&nbsp;&nbsp; The municipal council, when by special&nbsp; resolution&nbsp; it authorized&nbsp; the defendant as municipal president&nbsp; to&nbsp; make collections, did so&nbsp; under the belief that as president, he would be able to render more assistance in the collection of the necessary funds than persons who were not occupying official positions.&nbsp;&nbsp; He accepted the appointment, he collected the funds, representing to the persons from whom he&nbsp; collected them that they were&nbsp; to&nbsp; be used in the construction of a public school.&nbsp; After collecting the same, he not only refused to deliver or turn over said funds to the proper authorities, but denied that he had received the same.&nbsp; It seems clear to us that the defendant, while acting as a public official, took advantage of his position as president of the municipality of Victoria, and should therefore&nbsp; be&nbsp; punished, in addition to the punishment imposed by the lower court, with temporary special disqualification for a period of eleven years and one day.<br><br>Therefore, the sentence of the lower court is hereby modified, and the defendant is hereby sentenced to be imprisoned for a period of two months and one day of <i>arresto mayor,</i> in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 5 of article 535. in its relation with&nbsp; paragraph&nbsp; 1&nbsp; of&nbsp; article 534&nbsp; of the Penal Code, and to suffer eleven years and one day of temporary special disqualification, in accordance with article 399 of the&nbsp; Penal Code, and to return to the offended person, Tiu&nbsp; Loco, or to the municipal&nbsp; treasurer, the sum of P4 and to pay the costs, and in case of insolvency to suffer subsidiary imprisonment, in accordance with the provisions of the law.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Arellano, C.
