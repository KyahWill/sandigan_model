				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Feliciano Bredejo, the appellant in this cause, is charged with having killed Cornelio Pilapil by inflicting upon him two wounds in his back, with a dagger, at a&nbsp; moment when the&nbsp; latter, who was entirely&nbsp; unwarned, was climbing the stairs&nbsp; of Ambrosio&nbsp; Medina's house.&nbsp;&nbsp; As&nbsp; a&nbsp; result&nbsp; of the wounds, which were 3 to 4 inches in depth, the victim fell lifeless to the ground.<p>At 5 o'clock one afternoon Juan Niunay and Feliciano Bredejo engaged in an altercation over a wager on a cockfight;&nbsp; Bredejo denied that the&nbsp; bet had been&nbsp; made&nbsp; and refused to pay; Niunay became&nbsp; quiet, and each went his way.&nbsp; At 7 o'clock that evening&nbsp; Bredejo returned to Niunay's store,&nbsp; near the cockpit,&nbsp; and again brought up the matter of the wager.&nbsp;&nbsp; Evaristo Tudtud was present at the time and confirmed the fact that the bet had been made; thereupon&nbsp; Bredejo, hearing&nbsp; this, turned against Tudtud and struck at him with a dagger, which&nbsp; he&nbsp; was&nbsp; able to avoid, but Bredejo immediately made another thrust at him which, owing to Tudtud's speedy&nbsp; flight, did him no injury, and only tore&nbsp; his shirt.&nbsp; Bredejo ran after&nbsp; Tudtud,&nbsp; but could not overtake him; he then returned to the place from which he had&nbsp; started&nbsp; and assaulted Niunay who at first defended himself with a cane, with which he succeeded in hitting Bredejo on the nose, but,&nbsp; as the latter&nbsp; renewed the assault Niunay also took to flight&nbsp; and was pursued by Bredejo for about 30 brazas before he gave&nbsp; up the chase and again returned to the place of&nbsp; the attack.</p><p>At this juncture, Cornelio Pilapil, who had been sleeping in&nbsp; Ambrosio&nbsp; Medina's&nbsp; store,&nbsp; was awakened&nbsp; and&nbsp; being advised of what was taking place, got up and, taking a light, started to climb to the upper floor of Medina's house; just then Bredejo rushed up excitedly&nbsp; and at the moment when Pilapil was placing his&nbsp; foot on the first step of the stair, Bredejo struck him in&nbsp; the back&nbsp; with a dagger and,&nbsp; "as the defendant was zurdo&nbsp; (left handed), when the first blow was struck, and as Pilapil was about to fall, the defendant gave him another blow with the dagger in the&nbsp; same place; it was at this moment that he fell face downwards."&nbsp; (Trial record,&nbsp; p.&nbsp; 19.)&nbsp; Thereupon&nbsp; the defendant dared Medina to come down and ascended the steps,&nbsp; but on&nbsp; reaching the last step of the stairs, as Medina and&nbsp; those&nbsp; living in the house had climbed up into the loft, Bredejo descended, shouting that he would kill all of them, especially Niunay's family.&nbsp; Such are the facts.</p><p>The fact that the defendant is zurdo, or left-handed, and that&nbsp; Pilapil was not a resident&nbsp; of Medina's&nbsp; house, apparently explains the phrase found in the decision&nbsp; of the lower court, to wit, that the&nbsp; deceased was "a stranger and, besides, deaf&nbsp; (<em>sordo</em>)"&nbsp; (record, p.&nbsp; 4)&nbsp; circumstances, however, which can have no weight in passing judgment upon the&nbsp; criminal&nbsp; acts,&nbsp; as a&nbsp; whole.&nbsp; Although the evidence clearly shows that Bredejo violated&nbsp; another's domicile, the private residence of Medina, where Pilapil&nbsp; was enjoying the confidence and abandon one&nbsp; naturally feels in the place he has chosen to rest and whither, moreover, he had gone to escape that criminal's fury,&nbsp; yet the criminal law requires, in order to consider this circumstance as an aggravating one,&nbsp; that&nbsp; the crime&nbsp; should&nbsp; have been&nbsp; committed in the offended party's&nbsp; dwelling,&nbsp; and Medina does not figure in this cause&nbsp; as an offended party, nor does it in any manner appear that Medina's house was the dwelling of the offended party, Pilapil. </p><p>The crime perpetrated by&nbsp; the appellant was duly&nbsp; classified by the trial&nbsp; judge as consummated murder, owing to the circumstance&nbsp; of treachery attending its commission and in regard. to which no question has been raised.</p><p>The penalty for the crime&nbsp; of murder is <em>cadena temporal</em> from its maximum degree to&nbsp; death.&nbsp; (Penal Code, art. 403, par. 2.)&nbsp; As this punishment is divided&nbsp; into three distinct parts, which&nbsp; are&nbsp; <em>cadena temporal,&nbsp; cadena perpetua,</em> and death, each of which&nbsp; form&nbsp; a&nbsp; separate grade&nbsp; (id., art. 97), the minimum&nbsp; penalty should&nbsp; be imposed only when a mitigating circumstance alone&nbsp; is present,&nbsp; but if there concur both aggravating and mitigating circumstances they should be reasonably balanced in fixing the penalty&nbsp; (id., art. 81).</p><p>In&nbsp; the sentence imposed,&nbsp; only one extenuating circumstance was considered in conjunction with that of article 11, to wit, non-habitual drunkenness,&nbsp; together&nbsp; with that of race,&nbsp; the penalty&nbsp; was imposed&nbsp; in&nbsp; its medium degree, while it should, in such a&nbsp; case,&nbsp; have been applied in the minimum degree.</p><p>However, in the opinion of this court, the penalty is properly applied,&nbsp; for the reason that, in considering the&nbsp; commission of the crime, account should have been taken of the fact of its being perpetrated at night, a circumstance which, according to the proofs, was not inherent in that of treachery; and as that aggravating circumstance should be considered separately, it is to be offset by the aforesaid extenuating one&nbsp; and the penalty&nbsp; must&nbsp; be applied in the medium degree.</p><p>Therefore, the judgment&nbsp; appealed from is affirmed,&nbsp; with the costs of this instance against the appellant.</p><p><em>Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson, Moreland</em>, and <em>Trent, JJ</em>.,concur.</p></div>
