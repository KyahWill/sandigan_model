				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE,  VS. ANTONIO SEVILLA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.

				<BR><STRONG> WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The testimony of the clergyman, Tranquilino Manahan, is written in such  a manner that it is almost impossible to know if, reference  is made to threats actually made in  his presence  or to  a narration of prior threats related to him in the interview referred to.  We are inclined to believe the latter, inasmuch as it  is not probable that at an interview at which  the. accused  and the complaining witness were present, which interview  seems to have  been held for the purpose of securing the money which the latter had promised to pay  to the accused, the  defendant should have threatened the  other with death if she did  not do the very thing which he was then performing.
<p> From this  testimony it appears doubtful if in the interview referred to there  was an actual and certain payment of the $125 either by  the complainant or  by the  witness. If this payment was made, then it seems  certain that there were no threats; if not, then there is lacking evidence to establish  such  payment.  The complainant so testified in her preliminary statement and the lower court in its judgment states that this was confirmed in her statement during the trial; but it does not so appear in  the record, nor does it appear that she has given any testimony whatever at the trial.</p>
<p> The witness Segunda Austria testified that the accused struck Benita  Vinson  because the latter  had taken his jewels according to his  statements.  This witness says nothing concerning the question of  whether threats  were involved.  The only witness who so affirms  is  Hermogenes de los Reyes.  The latter says that he was called to the house of Maria Vinson, where he found the accused striking the said  Maria and striking  Benita Vinson,  saying that he would kill them if they did not return to him the jewelry which he had lost.</p>
<p> With  the record in this state we can not declare the accused  guilty of a violation of article 494 of  the Penal Code. The threats which are there dealt with are those made with the dejifterate purpose of creating in the mind of the person threatened the belief that the threat will be carried  into effect.  The  said article does not  relate to threats which may be made at the time of an unlawful assault and which form  part of  the same.   The Supreme Court has so declareaTepeatedly.   (Sentences of April 13, 1874, and June 19, 1878.)</p>
<p> With reference to threats, it is seen that the accused is guilty of the  misdemeanor provided for and punished in article 589. It appears furthermore, from the evidence, that the defendant  is guilty of  the crime of compulsion (<em>coaccion</em>) according to  the provisions of article 497 of the Penal Code.  But we can not condemn him for that crime upon the present complaint.  In accordance with the provisions of article 6, No. 2, of General Orders, No. 58, the crime is specified in the complaint  as that of threatening (<em>amenazas</em>).  The facts set forth in compliance with No. 3 of the same  article state  that the accused threatened  the complainant with death  and that the latter feared that he would carry out his threat.  At the conclusion of the complaint it  is expressly stated that the defendant is prosecuted for the violation of  article 494.  This construction served as the basis throughout the entire  course of the trial and the  attorney for the defense waived the crossexamination of one of the witnesses  on the express grounds that her  testimony referred solely to the violence and not to the threats.  The two crimes of threats and of compulsion are distinct and can not be prosecuted in a single complaint according to article 11 of General Orders, No.  58. The fact  that the complaint contains allegations which disclose  that the crime  of compulsion has been committed does not justify us in  convicting the defendant of this crime, because of the lack of evidence to prove the crime of threats of which he is likewise accused in the complaint We decide that the accused can not be found guilty of compulsion upon  this complaint,  and therefore the right is reserved  to the fiscal to present  a further complaint against him for the aforesaid crime if it be deemed proper.</p>
<p> The judgment appealed from is reversed and the accused condemned to five days  of  imprisonment  (<em>arresto</em>) aild  a fine of 125 pesetas, or subsidiary imprisonment as fixed by law in case of insolvency, with costs in this instance taxed officially and  those  of first instance  taxed against appellant.  It is so  ordered.</p>
<p>  <em>Arellano, C, J., Torres,  Cooper, Mapa,</em> and <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
