				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">OFFENSES AGAINST CHASTITY ; SUFFICIENCY OF PROOF.— From the Court of Instance of Pangasinan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jenkins, J.<br><br>The complaining witness identified the accused, whom she had previously known, as the parties who committed the offense charged. Counsel for the defense attached much importance to the statement by the witness to another party, whom she first sent to make a complaint, that he should inform the authorities that the only person recognized was one Juan Coret. The following morning she made a written complaint against the defendants. No evidence to show that she had any reason for accusing the defendant unjustly.&nbsp; Judgment of conviction affirmed.<br><br>For appellants: Wade H. Kitchens.<br><br>For appellee: Solicitor-General Harvey.</div>
