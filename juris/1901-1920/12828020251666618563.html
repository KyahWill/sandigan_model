				<BR><STRONG>MORELAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">From the printed record in this case it appears that the appellee, on the 1st 
day of September, 1914, moved the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila 
for the appointment of an administrator for the estate of Jose Gregorio Rocha, 
deceased. A citation was issued by the court in pursuance of the motion 
directing the persons interested in the estate of the said decedent to show 
cause in that court on the 19th day of September, 1914, why an administrator for 
the estate of the said decedent should not be appointed. The hearing on the 
motion seems not to have been held on the return day and the proceedings were 
held in abeyance until the court should fix another day for the hearing. On the 
3d day of October, 1914, the appellant filed a paper, called in the proceedings 
a motion, objecting to the continuance of the proceedings for the appointment of 
an administrator. This objection was amplified by two or three writings filed 
later, called by the objector motions. Later upon motion of the appellee the 
hearing on the application for the appointment of an administrator was set for 
the 1st day of November, 1915, at 3 p. m., by an order dated the 26th of October 
1915. This order of the 26th of October is as follows:
<p>"The motion of Gutierrez Repide and Sodas as attorneys for Maria Eloisa Rocha 
y Casal praying that this proceeding for the appointment of an administrator of 
the deceased Jose Gregorio Rocha be brought on for a hearing and that the matter 
proceed to a final liquidation and distribution of the estate of the deceased, 
having been presented to the court together with the countermotion of Sr. 
Varela, attorney for Emilia Tuason y Patino, in which he prays that the 
proceeding be dismissed; and it appearing that commissioners to hear claims 
against the estate had not been appointed and that for that reason this 
proceeding cannot be terminated without the consent of all the parties 
interested, and in view of the fact that the executors named in the will, Doña 
Emilia Tuason y Patino and D. Ramon Despujol y Sabater are absent from the 
Philippine Islands, and that the third executor D. Lorenzo Rocha de Icaza 
died;</p>
<p>"The countermotion of Sr. Varela is denied.</p>
<p>"The 1st day of November, 1915, at 3 p. m., is hereby set for the hearing of 
this proceeding to the end that the interested parties may indicate to the court 
whom they desire shall be appointed administrator of the estate of the said 
decedent and also the persons who should act as commissioners.</p>
<p>"Let this order setting the day for a hearing be notified to Gutierrez Repide 
and Jose Varela Calderon, attorneys for the interested parties."</p>
<p>From this order the appeal before us was taken.</p>
<p>The contention of the appellee is that the order appealed from is not 
appealable and that the appeal should be dismissed.</p>
<p>We are satisfied that the appellee is right in her contention. An order of a 
court setting a day for a hearing is not an appealable order. Such an order 
decides no controversy, affects no rights, and determines nothing. It simply 
gives the parties an opportunity to be heard and the court an occasion for 
action.</p>
<p>Nor is that portion of the order which says "The counter-motion of Sr. Varela 
is denied" appealable. The objection of the appellant to the continuance of the 
proceedings for the appointment of an administrator was not in real sense a 
motion; and the expression of the court is not to be taken literally when it 
denied "the countermotion" of the appellant. The objection interposed by the 
appellant to the continuance of the proceeding to appoint an administrator, as 
stated in the objection papers, was valueless for any purpose. The proper 
procedure for appellant was to appear on the day set for the hearing and present 
her objections to the proceeding and support them by such evidence or argument 
as she may have had. Then if the court had appointed an administrator over her 
objections she would have had some definite ruling of the court, obtained in a 
legal manner, that would have been subject to exception. But the mere objection 
that a motion or proceeding be heard at all is neither a countermotion nor a 
motion, nor does it have any effect whatever in law. As a result a mere 
objection in a proceeding to appoint an administrator to the effect that the 
court should not hear the proceeding has no value and produces no effect in law. 
An interested person has a right to make a motion for the appointment of an 
administrator of a deceased person, and it is not only the right but the duty of 
a court to hear that motion. An objection that it be not heard is improper and 
without force or effect.</p>
<p>These remarks are not intended to refer to their full extent to a case where 
there is a failure to serve process on the respondent and where, accordingly, no 
jurisdiction has been obtained over his person. In such case an objection, 
properly made, on the day set for the hearing, that the hearing do not proceed 
is proper and well founded.</p>
<p>That portion of appellant's objections which asks that the proceeding be 
dismissed before the hearing raises no question that the court could decide 
prior to the hearing of the proceeding to appoint the administrator. If it was 
worth anything at all, legally speaking, it was simply a <em>defense</em> to the 
proceeding which should have been presented as such and determined on the 
hearing of the proceeding to appoint.</p>
<p>The appeal is hereby dismissed, with costs against the appellant. So 
ordered.</p><em>Torres, Trent,</em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.</em>, concur. 
<br><br><br>
<hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1">

<p>CARSON, J., dissenting:</p>
<p>I dissent.</p>
<p>I think that the real question raised and determined in the court below was 
whether or not an administrator should be appointed for the estate of the 
deceased; and an order adjudicating such a question is an order which 
constitutes a final determination of the rights of the parties thereunder, 
within the meaning of section 783 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and as such, 
appealable. (Cf. Sy Hong Eng <em>vs</em>. Sy Lioc Suy, 8 Phil. Rep., 594.)</p>
<p>The mere fact that the order, in addition to the determination of the 
question as to whether an administrator should or should not be appointed, 
contains a further provision fixing a day for a hearing as to the person who 
should be appointed administrator, does not deprive an interested party of his 
right to appeal from so much of the order as finally adjudicates the vital 
question whether the estate should or should not be placed in the hands of an 
administrator. The reasoning of the above cited case of Sy Hong Eng <em>vs</em>. 
Sy Lioc Suy seems to me to be conclusive in this regard.</p></div>
