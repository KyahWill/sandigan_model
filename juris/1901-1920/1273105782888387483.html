				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The defendant, who was the municipal treasurer of Barugo,&nbsp; Province of&nbsp; Leyte, was convicted by the&nbsp; Court of First&nbsp; Instance of the&nbsp; said province&nbsp; of the crime of the falsification of a public document.<br><br>This falsification&nbsp; was alleged to consist in his&nbsp; having signed, at the foot&nbsp; of a municipal pay roll,&nbsp; Exhibit B, the printed part thereof which reads thus: "I&nbsp; certify under official oath that the preceding pay roll&nbsp; is correct, that the services have&nbsp; been&nbsp; rendered&nbsp; and the payments&nbsp; made as stated," while in fact V. A.&nbsp; Penaranda, as municipal secretary at a salary of P33,&nbsp; and Bibiano Avestruz, as&nbsp; clerk to the president&nbsp; at a&nbsp; salary&nbsp; of P20,&nbsp; did&nbsp; not render the services as&nbsp; stated in the said pay roll.<br><br>The&nbsp; Attorney-General, who&nbsp; prays&nbsp; for the acquittal&nbsp; of the defendant, the appellant, firmly bases his petition&nbsp; on the following argument:<br><blockquote>"It is an undisputed fact that Venturito Penaranda and Bibiano Avestruz&nbsp; were duly&nbsp; appointed and&nbsp; qualified&nbsp; as municipal secretary and clerk to the municipal president of Barugo, respectively,&nbsp; when the pay roll, Exhibit B, was made out,&nbsp; and were,&nbsp; really or apparently, discharging the duties of their offices on&nbsp; that&nbsp; date; that the services&nbsp; of municipal&nbsp; secretary and clerk to the municipal president were rendered at&nbsp; the time referred to in the pay roll, and&nbsp; that Venturito Penaranda and Bibiano Avestruz received their respective salaries from the appellant.&nbsp; The latter's certification was an embodiment of these facts, and consequently, it may not be said that he was untruthful in the narration of the facts.&nbsp; The defendant certified that the services of&nbsp; municipal secretary were rendered, and this was the truth."</blockquote>Since what the defendant certified to was the truth,&nbsp; as proved at the trial, with respect to Venturito Penaranda, by documents signed by the latter as such municipal secretary of Barugo,&nbsp; he did&nbsp; not pervert&nbsp; the truth, and the charge falls to the ground.<br><br>It is not the mission of the municipal&nbsp; treasurer to take upon&nbsp; himself to investigate whether the persons&nbsp; who are accredited&nbsp; to him as&nbsp; secretary and clerk by the municipal council and whom he, in turn, acknowledges and pays their monthly salaries, really or apparently discharge the duties of these positions.<br><br>The judgment appealed from is reversed and Esteban&nbsp; T. Balais is acquitted, with the costs of both&nbsp; instances <i>de oficio</i>.&nbsp; So&nbsp; ordered.<br><br><i> Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson, Moreland,</i> and <i>Trent, JJ.</i>, concur.<br></div>
