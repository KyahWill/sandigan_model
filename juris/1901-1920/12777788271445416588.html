				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This case is one growing out of events which transpired in 1899 during the 
existence of the Filipino Revolutionary Government.
<p>On June 26, 1916, an amended information was filed in the Court of First 
Instance of Nueva Ecija, charging Daniel Pagaduan, Francisco Masibay, Evaristo 
Limpin, and Modesto Raingin with the crime of robbery with homicide. The 
defendants on arraignment entered a plea of not guilty and at the same time set 
up what amounted to a special plea of <em>autrefois acquit</em>. After trial 
before the Honorable Vicente Nepomuceno, judge of First Instance, Modesto 
Raingin was acquitted, Daniel Pagaduan, Evaristo Limpin, and Francisco Masibay 
were convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment (<em>cadena perpetua</em>). 
These last named defendants have appealed.</p>
<p>As introductory to a statement of the facts, a few preliminary observations 
are in order. And first, it is to be noted that seventeen years elapsed between 
the alleged perpetration of the crime and the institution of the prosecution. 
The duty of the court to resolve all reasonable doubt in favor of the accused is 
thus intensified. Delay in the commencement of a criminal action creates a 
suspicion unless explained. The motive of the prosecution in suddenly assuming 
activity after long continued silence, when the accused have made no effort to 
escape and the witnesses are available, may well be questioned. Herein, it is 
suggested by the evidence and in the argument that personal and political 
reasons actuated the prosecution. We proffer no comment as to this, but only 
mention it as offering a possible ulterior explanation of the prosecution. The 
lapse of time may also result in the destruction of affirmative evidence tending 
to establish the innocence of the accused. Again, and from an entirely different 
standpoint, the testimony of witnesses such as are found in the present case, 
while rightly subject to careful scrutiny, should not be rejected if found to be 
reasonable and consistent and not contradicted by evidence from any reliable 
source. These principles are here set forth, not as establishing any new and 
novel doctrines, but merely, in synthesis, as indicative of the attitude of this 
court as disclosed in numerous decisions. (<em>See</em> especially U. S. 
<em>vs</em>. Mante [1914], 27 Phil., 134; U. S. <em>vs</em>. Briones [1914], 28 
Phil., 367; U. S. <em>vs</em>. Cardona [1917], 36 Phil, 438.) Notwithstanding, 
however, instead of giving the accused the benefit of these views, the trial 
judge, in his decision, after making statements which would inevitably lead to 
acquittal, continually nullifies the same, by failing to believe the evidence 
for the defense. As opposed to such an attitude, we approach a statement of the 
case, remembering not alone the presumption of innocence in favor of the 
accused, but that the passage of time may have produced an unfavorable effect on 
the chances of the defense, remembering that, under such conditions, the 
prosecution must establish its case by evidence which taken together is found to 
be clear and convincing, and remembering, finally, that the testimony of the 
witnesses for the defense are not to be rejected without good reason but are to 
be given, in view of the circumstances of this case, special consideration.</p>
<p>The statements just made fail to disclose the unusual features presented by 
this appeal. In order to get the situation clearly before us, we must make a 
finding of the salient facts in chronological and historical form.</p>
<p>In May, 1899, the war between the American and Revolutionary forces in the 
Philippines was on. The Filipino Government, from the standpoint of 
International Law, was of the class known as "<em>de facto</em> government." 
(Macleod <em>vs</em>. U. S. [1912], 229 U. S., 416.) The capital of the 
Revolutionary Government was at Tarlac. General Aguinaldo was the Commanding 
General and President of the Revolutionary Government. General Luna was in 
command of the Revolutionary forces in the north. Colonel Pablo Tecson, who 
previously had been Secretary and Member of the Revolutionary Congress and 
Secretary of the Mixed Civil and Military Commission, in May, 1899, was Auditor 
to the Commanding General and President. General Pablo Padilla was military 
governor of Nueva Ecija. Santiago Guimson was a "Juez instructor." Benito 
Calderon was a "Delegado de justicia" in Zaragoza, Nueva Ecija. The northern 
provinces, including the Province of Nueva Ecija, were under the control of the 
Revolutionary Government. Local administration adapted from the system in force 
under Spain was in operation. The municipality of Zaragoza, Province of Nueva 
Ecija, had such a local organization. Vicente de Castro, now deceased, was the 
president or local chief of Zaragoza. Daniel Pagaduan, defendant, was "Delegado 
de policia." Francisco Masibay, defendant, was "Delegado de rentas." Evaristo 
Limpin, defendant, was a policeman in Zaragoza.</p>
<p>General Luna had earlier issued an order to the authorities of the 
Revolutionary Government under his jurisdiction to hunt down and kill all spies. 
The defendant Pagaduan testified that this order was in substance as follows: 
"There having come to the notice of the Office of the Secretary of War that with 
frequency some Chinamen serve as spies for the American forces, it is hereby 
decreed to all civil or military officials that upon the approach of the 
American forces to their town or towns, they immediately order the arrest of the 
Chinese residents in the respective towns, and should they arouse suspicion that 
they are spies, or be found to be under such circumstances as to prejudice our 
Government, that they be ordered executed." This order was received in Zaragoza. 
Certain Chinese in the municipality had been suspected of being spies of the 
Americans. Acting, therefore, pursuant to the circular of General Luna and under 
the direct order of the municipal president, on one of the days of May, 1899, 
the houses of these Chinese were sacked. The Chinese, nine in number, were 
conducted to the municipal building. A little later, the Chinese were taken to 
the barrio of Balucot and killed. The present defendants with others 
participated directly in the execution of these deeds.</p>
<p>These occurrences, coming to the notice of General Aguinaldo, Colonel Tecson 
was ordered to make an investigation. No one was in a better position to know 
what happened at this investigation than Colonel Tecson, the man who conducted 
it. We are shown no reason which would authorize us to conclude, as did the 
trial court, that the vital part of Colonel Tecson's testimony "is unworthy of 
belief." Moreover, Santiago Quimson, <em>Juez instructor,</em> and Benito 
Calderon, <em>Delegado de justicia</em>, corroborated Colonel Tecson's 
remembrance of this investigation. Colonel Tecson testified that he proceeded in 
the hearing pursuant to the provisions of the Military Code made up of orders of 
the Commanding General. After examining many persons both in Nueva Ecija and in 
Tarlac, Colonel Tecson says that he found it to be true that the dead Chinese 
had been spies, who had transmitted information to the Americans. As a result of 
the investigation, General Aguinaldo ordered the accused to be 
liberated.<br><br>Nine years passed. In October, 1908, the justice of the peace 
of Zaragoza conducted an investigation of charges against Pagaduan and Masibay. 
Nothing came of the investigation. Eight years more passed. And then, the 
present prosecution was instituted. </p>
<p>Expecting contradictions and failure of memory from witnesses, some of whom 
are ignorant men, because of the long period of time which has passed since the 
actual events transpired, and recalling our preliminary observations the 
foregoing are believed to be true facts.</p>
<p>Defendants and appellants assign three errors of the trial court, namely: (1) 
In declaring that the accused are guilty of the crime of murder; (2) in not 
declaring that the accused were previously put in jeopardy; and (3) in not 
declaring that the accused are entitled to the benefits of the Amnesty 
Proclamation issued by the President of the United States on July 4, 1902. We 
pass by the first assignment of error for on a bare statement of the proof 
unsupported by the other contentions, the assignment could not prosper. The 
second assignment of error is to the effect that the accused having been tried 
and acquitted of the same charge by a tribunal of the <em>de facto</em> 
Government, they have been twice placed in jeopardy of the same offense. A study 
of this unusual question in the light of history and jurisprudence would prove 
most interesting. Regretfully we abstain from such a fascinating investigation 
in order to resolve the last assignment of error, which is more easily decisive 
of the case.</p>
<p>Do the accused come within the provisions of the Amnesty Proclamation of the 
President of the United States of July 4, 1902? This proclamation declared:</p>
<p>"A full and complete pardon and amnesty to all persons in the Philippine 
Archipelago who have participated in the insurrections aforesaid (against Spain 
or the United States) or who have given aid and comfort to persons participating 
in said insurrections, for the offenses of treason or sedition and for all 
offenses political in their character committed in the course of such 
insurrections pursuant to orders issued by the civil or military insurrectionary 
authorities or which grew out of internal political feuds or dissensions between 
Filipinos and Spaniards or the Spanish authorities or which resulted from 
internal political feuds or dissensions among the Filipinos themselves during 
either of said insurrections."</p>
<p>The Amnesty Proclamation was intended as a humane grant of mercy and grace. 
Acts occurring during the stress of war, which under ordinary conditions would 
merit punishment, were to be forgiven and forgotten. The Government was not to 
await the passing of years, and then for some cause or other, or out of caprice, 
or even for more reprehensible motives, suddenly drag citizens from their homes, 
stand them before the bar of justice, and try and convict them as in the usual 
criminal case.</p>
<p>The Amnesty Proclamation has been held to cover three classes of offenses: 
(1) Purely political crimes, compendiously described in the proclamation as 
"treason and sedition;" (2) common crimes "political in their character," that 
is, committed in furtherance of the interest of the insurrection, if committed 
pursuant to orders from superior authority; and (3) crimes which are shown to 
have had their origin in the two classes of "internal political feuds or 
dissensions" named, without reference to whether they are in their nature 
political or common crimes, or common crimes of a political character, and 
without reference to whether they were committed under orders of a superior 
authority or not. (U. S. <em>vs.</em> Vergara [1903], 1 Phil., 638.) How do our 
facts plumb with these essential requisites of the Amnesty Proclamation? All of 
the accused were officials or employees of the Revolutionary Government. The 
defendants were taking part in a civil capacity against the United States in the 
insurrection mentioned in the Amnesty Proclamation. Murder and robbery are the 
ordinary appellations of the crimes they committed. Such are abhorrent crimes 
high in the scale of infamy. The State punishes them with long imprisonment or 
death. Yet, in times of war, such occurrences are not unexpected. The bloody 
tragedies of the French Revolution and of the American Civil War, and, even more 
recently, the events of the Russian war of liberation, convey to us a message of 
toleration and commiseration. So likewise in the Philippines, the common crimes 
of murder and robbery could be, and were, committed during the Revolution, under 
circumstances which clothed them with a political character. These crimes 
related to the Revolution, and apparently were committed to further the 
interests of the Revolution. The killing of persons who were believed to be 
American spies has been held, in many cases, to be crimes falling within the 
scope of the Amnesty Proclamation. Even where the officer not only kills 
suspected persons but robs them of their property, the robbery has been regarded 
as in the nature of a reprisal and so to be pardoned with the murder. 
(<em>See</em> U. S. <em>vs.</em> Alhambra [1903], 2 Phil., 80.) And finally, 
herein, it is not to be forgotten that the alleged crimes were committed by 
officers of the Revolutionary Government in pursuance of orders issued by their 
superior military leaders.</p>
<p>The defendants and appellants are entitled to the benefits of the Amnesty 
Proclamation. Accordingly, the judgment of the lower court is reversed and the 
defendants and appellants are acquitted, with the costs of both instances <em>de 
officio</em>. So ordered.</p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres</em>, and <em>Araullo, 
JJ.</em>, concur. <br><br><br>
<hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1">

<p><strong>JOHNSON, J.,</strong> concurring:</p>I agree with the conclusion that 
the defendants should be absolved from all liability under the complaint upon 
the ground that they are entitled to the benefits of the Amnesty Proclamation of 
July 4, 1902. It has been the policy of this court since its organization not to 
include in a decision any doctrine or argument which is not germane to the 
particular question presented. I am still of the opinion that that policy is a 
wise one and should be adhered to. Questions which are, and not. which may be, 
presented should be decided only. <br><br><br>
<hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1">

<p><strong>CARSON, J.,</strong> concurring:</p>I concur. The accused are clearly 
entitled to the benefits of the Amnesty Proclamation. <br><br><br>
<hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1">

<p><strong>STREET, J.</strong>, concurring:</p>
<p>I concur on the grounds stated by Justices Carson and Johnson.</p></div>
