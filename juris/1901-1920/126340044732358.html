				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On the 16th day of March, 1904, the defendants herein entered into  a  certain  contract with the Government  of the United States, represented by Lieutenant-Colonel M. C. Martin, constructing.quartermaster  of  the  United States ,  Army, for the erection and construction of sixty-five frame buildings at Fort Wm. McKinley, near the city of Manila, P. I.</p>
<p>On the 20th day of April,  1904, the  defendants herein made and entered into a certain agreement with the plaintiff wherein and whereby  said  plaintiff agreed  to erect and construct sixteen of the  said frame buildings, in accordance  and in conformity with the plans and  specifications for the construction thereof contained in the contract of the defendants herein and the said constructing quartermaster.</p>
<p>By the terms of the contract between  the  plaintiff and the defendants herein, the plaintiff agreed to do and perform all the manual labor required to erect and construct said sixteen frame buildings for the sum of 1,450 pesos for each of the said frame buildings.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the contract between the plaintiff and the defendants herein, it was the duty of the defendants to furnish and  place upon the ground where  said frame  buildings were to be constructed, all the necessary material for the construction of the same.</p>
<p>By the terms of the contract between the plaintiff and the defendants herein it was the duty of the plaintiff to complete his part of the contract within eight months from the said 20th day of April, 1904.</p>
<p>The  defendants herein not having complied with their contract with the said constructing quartermaster, were prohibited  on the 5th day of  January, 1905, from  continuing the erection  of all of the said sixty-five  frame buildings.   By reason of  this prohibition on the part of the constructing  quartermaster of  the  United  States Army,  the plaintiff was also thereby prohibited from  completing his contract with the defendants.</p>
<p>The  plaintiff claims that he was unable to comply  with the terms of his contract with the defendants for the  reason that the defendants failed to deliver the material  necessary for the construction  of the said sixteen frame buildings in accordance with the terms of their contract and instituted an action in the.Court of First Instance  of the city of Manila to recover the  amount due him by  reason of the breach  of  the contract on  the part  of the  said defendants.</p>
<p>Upon this question  of the noncompliance of the defendants with the terms of the contract which  prevented the plaintiff from  completing his contract  within the  time fixed, the lower court  found from the evidence as a fact:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"That the plaintiff  had been unable, to comply with the terms  of his contract with the defendants owing  to the failure of the defendants  to supply the transportation of material required under the contract."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This finding of the court  is  fully supported by the evidence adduced during the trial and waff practically admitted by the defendants,   This breach on the part  of the defendants is in itself sufficient to justify a recovery on the part of the plaintiff.</p>
<p>Much evidence was  adduced during the trial to show the quantity of labor furnished by the plaintiff under the contract and the percentage  of completion of the same. Upon  this question  the lower court  made the following finding:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"From the evidence presented  in the case, after duly considering the same and computing the percentage of the work completed on each building and making an average thereof, I find that there was completed, at the time the plaintiff ceased work under his contract, 61 per cent of the total amount of  work to  be performed by him  under the contract."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The total  amount which the  plaintiff was to receive under  the contract, had he fulfilled the same, was the sum of  23,200 pesos.  Sixty-one per cent  of  this amount is 14,152 pesos, the amount due'the plaintiff for the work actually performed by the plaintiff.  By reason  of  the breach of the contract  on the part of the defendants,  the plaintiff was entitled to  at least this  amount.  The evidence shows, however, that the plaintiff had received from the defendants  the sum  of 12,228 pesos.  Deducting "the amount  which  he had  actually  received  from  the amount to which he was entitled, we have  the sum  of 1,924 pesos.   Th.e lower court rendered judgment in favor of the  plaintiff for this amount and costs. The plaintiff failed  to show any special damages resulting to him by reason of the breach of the contract on the part  of  the defendants.</p>
<p>The  judgment of the lower court is hereby affirmed with costs.   After the expiration of ten days let judgment be entered in accordance  herewith and ten days thereafter the case be returned to the lower court for proper action. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Carson, Willard,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ., </em>concur.<br>
