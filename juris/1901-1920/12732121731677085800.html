				<BR><STRONG>MORELAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On May 12, 1908, the defendant F. C. Peters went to the Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation in the city of Manila and presented to the paying teller thereof an instrument in the form of a&nbsp; check, purporting to be drawn by a paymaster of&nbsp; the United States Navy, in&nbsp; favor&nbsp; of Peters, upon the Assistant Treasurer of the United States in&nbsp; the city of New York, for the sum&nbsp; of $3,000 United States currency and&nbsp; requested that the amount&nbsp; thereof&nbsp; be paid to him by the said banking corporation.&nbsp; The bank refused to pay to him the sum of money named in&nbsp; said instrument, and he went away from the bank, returning in a short time with the defendant Hawkes.&nbsp; Peters then&nbsp; placed his name upon the back of the instrument and the defendant Hawkes did&nbsp; likewise,&nbsp; writing&nbsp;&nbsp; his name&nbsp; below&nbsp;&nbsp; that&nbsp; of&nbsp; Peters. Neither of the defendants placed a&nbsp; date upon the indorsement made by him.&nbsp; Thereupon payment was made in one form or another by the bank to Peters of the sum named in the instrument.&nbsp; On presentation by the bank, payment of the instrument was refused by the drawee, the Assistant Treasurer of the United&nbsp; States at New&nbsp; York,&nbsp; upon the ground that the name of the paymaster of the United States Navy upon said instrument had been forged.&nbsp;&nbsp; The instrument was duly protested as a check and the notice required by law given to both of the defendants.&nbsp;&nbsp; This action was brought by the plaintiff against both Peters&nbsp; and Hawkes to recover the $3,000&nbsp; paid by&nbsp; the plaintiff&nbsp; upon&nbsp; said instrument.&nbsp;&nbsp; The following is a copy of the instrument in question :<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">"No. 312342.<br></div><br><div style="text-align: right;">"CAVITE, P. I., <i>Apr. 12, 1908.</i><br></div><br><div style="text-align: center;">"ASSISTANT TREASURER OF THE UNITED STATES,<br>"NEW YORK.<br></div><br>"Pay to the order of F. C. Peters, U. S. N., three thousand and 00/100 dollars ($3,000.00).<br><br><div style="text-align: right;">(Signed)&nbsp; "R. K. VAN MATER,<br>"<i>Asst. Paymaster,</i> U. S.&nbsp; N."<br></div></blockquote>The trial court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff against the defendant Peters for&nbsp; the full amount paid by it,&nbsp; less&nbsp; the amount theretofore realized&nbsp; from property of Peters, and dismissed the complaint as to Hawkes, absolving him from&nbsp; all&nbsp; liability in connection with the check.&nbsp;&nbsp; The court below based its&nbsp; decision in favor of Hawkes upon the proposition that he was liable, if at all, only as an indorser, and that, while under the&nbsp; English and American doctrine the acts of&nbsp; Hawkes were sufficient to charge him as indorser, nevertheless,&nbsp; under article 462 of the Code of Commerce of the Philippine Islands, his acts did not constitute an indorsement, because&nbsp; of his failure to date said indorsement as provided by subdivision 4 of said article.<br><br>The first question&nbsp; presented&nbsp; for&nbsp; determination by&nbsp; the appellant is whether&nbsp; or not the instrument in question is a&nbsp; check.&nbsp;&nbsp; The appellant&nbsp; urges that "the&nbsp; instrument in question&nbsp; is not a check; it embraces neither of&nbsp; the&nbsp; above essential features.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; not drawn&nbsp; upon&nbsp; funds of&nbsp; the drawer, but upon those of&nbsp; the United&nbsp; States; its dishonor gives the drawer no right of action&nbsp; against the drawee."<br><br>We do not&nbsp; deem it necessary for the purposes of this action to discuss or decide the general question whether this kind of instrument is or is not a check.&nbsp; We reach the same result in the decision of this case whether the instrument, strictly&nbsp; denned, is or is not a check in the general acceptation of the term.&nbsp; For the purposes of this action we assume it to be a check as denned by the Commercial Code inasmuch as, by a custom and usage thoroughly known to all the parties and voluntarily adopted and followed by them at the time, it had all of the qualities and performs all of the offices of a check.&nbsp;&nbsp; Law writes custom into contract.<br><br>We&nbsp; also find it unnecessary to pass upon&nbsp; the second question presented by the appellant in which he urges the proposition&nbsp; that&nbsp; even if said&nbsp; instrument is a check,&nbsp; its negotiability and transfer, together with all the forms and requisites necessary thereto, are matters wholly of Federal concern and are governed exclusively by the laws, rules, and regulations of the United States Government, and&nbsp; that the laws of the&nbsp; Philippine&nbsp; Islands are&nbsp; in nowise applicable thereto, especially where, as in this case, those laws are at variance with the laws, rules, or regulations of the United States Government.<br><br>The first defense interposed by the&nbsp; defendant Hawkes in this case, Peters not having offered any defense whatever, is that the defendant placed his name upon the&nbsp; back of the check simply for the purpose of identification, which purpose was known&nbsp; to the&nbsp; plaintiff at the&nbsp; time the&nbsp; name was written and&nbsp; the money was paid, and that such payment was made pursuant to such an&nbsp; understanding.&nbsp; We do not believe that this defense can be sustained.&nbsp; Even&nbsp; if parol evidence, apart from fraud or mistake, were admissible to show that the&nbsp; contract&nbsp; which appears from the&nbsp; indorsement was not the one which was actually executed, nevertheless, the&nbsp; defense&nbsp; interposed would have&nbsp; to be&nbsp; rejected for the reason that there is&nbsp; no evidence in the&nbsp; case to support it.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; only witness&nbsp; who testified to that point was one of the clerks of the bank named Evans.&nbsp; It appears from his&nbsp; testimony&nbsp; that when&nbsp; Mr.&nbsp; Peters presented the check to the bank for&nbsp; payment&nbsp; the accountant, Evans, referred the matter to Mr. Kennedy, the cashier of the bank, who, after examining&nbsp; it, stated to&nbsp; the witness that the bank would not cash the check unless Peters could secure somebody to guarantee the payment of the check who was known to the bank to be responsible; that this statement of Kennedy was transmitted to Peters by the witness; that Peters then left the bank and returned soon accompanied by the defendant Hawkes; that the check was again referred to Kennedy, who, after looking up Hawkes's account in the bank, stated to&nbsp; the witness that&nbsp; Hawkes would do as a backer of&nbsp; the check; that&nbsp; Evans then&nbsp; returned to&nbsp; the window where Peters and Hawkes were and Hawkes indorsed the&nbsp; check.&nbsp; As to the conversation had between him and&nbsp; the defendant Hawkes at the time Hawkes indorsed the check, the evidence is as follows:<br><blockquote>"Q. Did&nbsp; you say anything to him at&nbsp; that time? - A.&nbsp; I told him to sign under Mr. Peters's signature.<br><br>"Q. Is that all the conversation that&nbsp; occurred between Mr. Hawkes and yourself? - A. That is all I can remember.<br><br>"Q. Then it is a fact, is it not, that at that time all that was done,&nbsp; so far as you can say&nbsp; of your own knowledge, was that Mr. Hawkes placed his signature on the back of the check and said nothing to you at all? - A. I can not say for sure whether he said anything or whether he did&nbsp; not say anything.<br><br>"Q. But&nbsp; to the&nbsp; best of&nbsp; your memory he did not? - A. Yes, sir.<br><br>"Court&nbsp; (asking question).&nbsp; Do&nbsp; you mean to say that he did not say anything? - A.&nbsp; Yes, sir.<br><br>"Q. But&nbsp; your impression&nbsp; is that he did not say anything? - A. Yes, sir.<br><br>"Q. What do you mean by your answer 'yes, sir'?&nbsp; What do you mean by that ? - A. I mean&nbsp; that he signed the check as he was told to sign&nbsp; it without saying anything."</blockquote>On cross-examination the following questions and answers appear:<br><blockquote>"Q. Is it not a fact that at the time that Mr.&nbsp; Peters and Mr. Hawkes came to the bank together Mr. Peters said to you that he brought Mr. Hawkes, and that you&nbsp; then asked Mr.&nbsp; Hawkes&nbsp; if&nbsp; he knew Mr.&nbsp; Peters and&nbsp; could identify him ? - A. I perhaps did say that in the ordinary way.<br><br>"Q. And&nbsp; that&nbsp; he could identify him? - A. That&nbsp; is the ordinary question which we ask in cases of that kind.<br><br>"Q. But are you sure that you did not say words to that effect ? - A.&nbsp; I should not like to say at all.<br><br>"Q. But the probability is that you did say that to him? -&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Yes, sir."</blockquote>It is thus evident from the uncontradicted proof that Mr. Hawkes came to&nbsp; the bank and indorsed the check<i> without saying anything&nbsp; whatever.</i>&nbsp; It is also apparent&nbsp; that the evidence shows that the clerk of the bank <i>said nothing to Hawkes, at&nbsp; least nothing&nbsp; about identifying Peters.</i>&nbsp; All that the witness said in his testimony on that subject, upon which alone&nbsp; is based the contention&nbsp; that Hawkes&nbsp; indorsed simply to identify Peters,&nbsp; is that it was probable that he asked Mr. Hawkes if he could identify Peters, basing, as he says, that statement not upon his recollection or memory as to <i>what actually occurred </i>but upon a probability arising out of a custom which according to his own&nbsp; best recollection and memory was&nbsp; not followed on that occasion.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is not proof.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is, moreover, as before stated, the&nbsp; undisputed testimony that Hawkes himself<i> said nothing whatever at the time. </i>&nbsp; Besides, Hawkes was himself a witness on the trial of the case,&nbsp; with&nbsp; full opportunity&nbsp; (as it appears that no objection whatever was offered to this class of evidence) to testify to the&nbsp; facts which occurred&nbsp; at&nbsp; the time&nbsp; of the indorsement&nbsp; by him, and he made no&nbsp; reference to them. Upon this branch of the case he was silent.&nbsp; This&nbsp; makes the failure of proof above referred to all the more complete and striking.<br><br>From the evidence above transcribed, which is&nbsp; substantially all of the evidence upon the subject either&nbsp; of identity or guaranty, it is apparent that the defendant Hawkes can not be held as a&nbsp; guarantor.&nbsp; There is an entire failure of evidence to support such a liability, apart from the liability of indorsement, even if parol evidence were admissible under the circumstances of this case to show it.&nbsp; The talk between Peters and the bank had before the&nbsp; arrival of Hawkes as to the necessity of Peters' obtaining a responsible person to guarantee the check was never communicated to him.&nbsp; This is shown by the evidence quoted.<br><br>The second defense presented by the defendant Hawkes is that there&nbsp; is not&nbsp; a legal&nbsp; or&nbsp; enforceable contract&nbsp; of indorsement made&nbsp; by the defendant Hawkes, but that the indorsement on said check is defective for lack of date.&nbsp; We proceed to discuss&nbsp; that question:<br><br>1. There is no law in the Philippine Islands which requires the indorsement of a check to be dated.<br><br>The claim is made by the defendant Hawkes that article 462 of the Commercial Code is applicable to the indorsement of checks.&nbsp;&nbsp; The article reads as follows:<br><br>"The indorsement must contain:<br><blockquote>"1. The name and surname, firm name,&nbsp; or title of the person or company to whom or which the bill of exchange is transferred.<br><br>"2. The form&nbsp; in&nbsp; which the assignor acknowledges the consideration&nbsp; of the&nbsp; purchaser, as&nbsp; stated&nbsp; in&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 5&nbsp;&nbsp; of article 444.<br><br>"3. The name and surname, firm name,&nbsp; or title of the person from whom it is received, or to the account of whom it is charged, if it is not the same person to whom the bill of exchange is transferred.<br><br>"4. The date on which it is drawn.<br><br>"5. The signature of the indorser or of the person legally authorized to&nbsp; sign&nbsp; for him,&nbsp; which shall be&nbsp; stated in the subscribing clause."</blockquote>Article 461 reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"The ownership of bills of exchange shall be transferred by indorsement."</blockquote>It will be seen by a glance&nbsp; at article 461 that article 462 is expressly limited in its application to bills of exchange. If such article is applicable to checks, then the provision making it applicable must be found elsewhere than in these articles.&nbsp; The contention&nbsp; of the defendant&nbsp; is that&nbsp; such provision&nbsp; is found&nbsp; in article 533 of said code.&nbsp;&nbsp; A single glance at&nbsp; said article shows&nbsp; clearly and conclusively&nbsp; that this contention can not be sustained.&nbsp; Article 533 is one of the articles found under Title XI of the Commercial Code. The heading of that title and its subscription are as follows:<br><blockquote><center>"TITLE XI.<br></center><br>"Drafts, bills, and promissory notes payable to order and checks."&nbsp; There comes immediately&nbsp; thereafter the first subdivision of said title with its subscription, which follows:<br><center><br>"SECTION FIRST.<br></center><br>"Drafts, bills, and promissory notes payable to order."</blockquote>It should be noted that the word "checks," while appearing in the grand&nbsp; division "Title XI" and its&nbsp; subscription,&nbsp; is omitted in the subdivision "Section First" and its subscription.&nbsp;&nbsp; Under&nbsp; this&nbsp; "Section&nbsp; First"&nbsp; are found&nbsp; only three articles, namely, 531, 532, 533, which treat, as the subscription under "Section First" would indicate, not of checks but of&nbsp; <i>drafts,&nbsp; bills,&nbsp; and promissory notes payable to order.</i><br><br>Article 533 reads:<br><blockquote>"Art. 533.&nbsp; The indorsements&nbsp; on&nbsp; drafts&nbsp; and promissory notes payable to order must contain&nbsp; the same statements as those on bills of exchange."</blockquote>It is evident from&nbsp; the&nbsp; article that checks are wholly excluded from&nbsp; its operation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If&nbsp; more&nbsp; argument&nbsp; were needed to demonstrate such exclusion,&nbsp; it would be found in the fact that the second and last subdivision of "Title XI" <i>treats solely of checks.</i>&nbsp; It will be recalled that checks&nbsp; were omitted from the&nbsp; first subdivision of&nbsp; "Title XI" which includes article 533.&nbsp; Said second subdivision&nbsp; of "Title XI" and its subscription are as follows:<br><center><br>"SECTION SECOND.<br><br>"Checks."<br></center><br>This&nbsp; "Section Second" contains&nbsp; ten articles (534-543), all relating to and treating of checks exclusively, except the last, article&nbsp; 543,&nbsp; which&nbsp; refers to check&nbsp; stubs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless authority for the claim that article&nbsp; 462 is&nbsp; applicable to checks can be found somewhere&nbsp; among these ten articles, it does&nbsp; not exist.&nbsp; Counsel for&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants does not assert that any of these articles&nbsp; provides for such an application.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the contrary, he admits, by implication at least, that none of said articles makes applicable to checks the&nbsp; provisions of article 462.&nbsp;&nbsp; He rests his claim to such application entirely on article 533.&nbsp; Strange to say,&nbsp; however, counsel for the plaintiff admits in his brief that article 462&nbsp; is applicable to checks and bases that admission on the provisions of article 542.&nbsp; He says in his brief&nbsp; (English, p. 6) :&nbsp; "On the contrary, the requirement as to the dating of indorsements is limited to bills of&nbsp; exchange (art. 462), drafts and notes (art. 533)&nbsp; and checks (art. 542)."<br><br>We can not permit such admission to influence our decision, for the reason that we&nbsp; believe&nbsp; he is wrong in the grounds upon which that admission is made.&nbsp; Article 542 follows:<br><blockquote>"ART. 542. The provisions contained in this code relating to the several liability of the maker and indorsers, and to protests,&nbsp; as well as to the exercise of the actions&nbsp; arising from bills of&nbsp; exchange, shall be applicable to these instruments."<br></blockquote>It is evident that this article in no way&nbsp; affects the question before us.&nbsp; It in no way refers to or touches the form or the essential requisites of an&nbsp; indorsement.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; has&nbsp; no affirmative&nbsp; requirements in it.&nbsp;&nbsp; It does not provide that anything shall or shall not be, or shall or shall not be done. It simply makes applicable principles of&nbsp; liability <i>already laid&nbsp; down to a state&nbsp; of things&nbsp; already&nbsp; existing</i>.&nbsp; It&nbsp; has nothing to do with the establishment of those principles of liability; neither has it anything to do with the creation of the&nbsp; state of things to which&nbsp; it&nbsp; applies those principles. They both come to it ready&nbsp; made.&nbsp; The article simply says in effect that if a check has been drawn, and <i>if</i> it has&nbsp; been indorsed, then certain principles of liability shall be applied to the parties&nbsp; to the check.&nbsp; But it does not say what form such indorsement shall take or what requisites it shall have. As it has&nbsp; nothing to do with the form of the check or with the question of what are its requisites, so it has nothing to do with the form of the indorsement.&nbsp; The&nbsp; question&nbsp; is, "Is it an indorsement?" without regard to whether it has one form or another, that is, without regard as to whether it is made in red ink, blue ink, or black ink.&nbsp; If there is&nbsp; an indorsement, then this article&nbsp; applies certain principles to the&nbsp; responsibility of&nbsp; the parties <i>no matter whether&nbsp; the indorsement is in red, blue, or black ink.</i>&nbsp; In short, this article does not pretend to regulate the incidental form&nbsp; or special features of the indorsement.&nbsp; The Commercial Code recognizes as valid and legal at least two kinds of indorsement, namely, the indorsement of a bill of exchange, which bill, because of its special nature,&nbsp; requires special features in the indorsement (art. 462), and the common law indorsement,&nbsp; so called, recognized by the law merchant the world over, admittedly the indorsement which is required by the Commercial Code as to bottomry&nbsp; and respondentia bonds (art.&nbsp; 722) and bills of lading&nbsp; (art. 708).&nbsp; These latter instruments, being of a nature quite different from a&nbsp; bill of exchange,&nbsp; do not require, as does said bill, any special features&nbsp; in&nbsp; their indorsement.&nbsp; Now, article 535 says:<br><blockquote>"Art.&nbsp; 535. The check must&nbsp; contain:<br><br>"The name and signature of the maker, and the name&nbsp; of the person on whom it is drawn and his domicile, amount and date of&nbsp; issue, which must be written out, and if payable to bearer, to a determined person, or to order; in the latter case it shall be transferable by indorsement."<br></blockquote>This article says&nbsp; that a check drawn&nbsp; payable to order "shall be transferable by indorsement."&nbsp; This is&nbsp; just what the code requires as to the indorsement of the bonds (art. 722)&nbsp; and of the bills of lading (art. 708), above referred to.&nbsp; Nothing whatever is said in any of these three articles, 535,&nbsp; 708, 722,&nbsp; as to what requisites&nbsp; are necessary&nbsp; to constitute such indorsement.&nbsp;&nbsp; No reference is made by any of them&nbsp; to article 462, and nowhere among all the articles treating&nbsp; of checks, bonds, or bills of lading, all negotiable instruments, is there any reference whatever to article 462. There being two kinds of legal and valid indorsements and the provisions of the Commercial Code relating to checks not specifying the kind required, then a check indorsed in either way would&nbsp; be validly indorsed and&nbsp; would bring it under article 542 respecting the responsibility of the parties to&nbsp; the check.&nbsp; This&nbsp; article, then,&nbsp; has no application until after the&nbsp; indorsement is completed, that is to&nbsp; say, until after it is in&nbsp; existence.&nbsp;&nbsp; It can not be contended that a provision&nbsp; of law which has no&nbsp; operation or force until a given thing is in existence can have any influence whatever on&nbsp; those&nbsp; forces or&nbsp; acts or&nbsp; forms&nbsp; which bring it&nbsp; into existence.<br><br>Moreover, the article in question, 542, clearly indicates the extent of its&nbsp; application.&nbsp; It says:&nbsp; "The&nbsp; provisions contained&nbsp; in this&nbsp; code&nbsp; relating&nbsp; to the&nbsp; several liability (garantia) of the maker and indorsers,&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *"&nbsp; Is not that reference definite and clear?&nbsp; It is&nbsp; perfectly easy to find the articles of the code&nbsp; which regulate&nbsp; and&nbsp; provide for the&nbsp; liability of&nbsp; the&nbsp; maker&nbsp; and indorsers of&nbsp; bills of exchange.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are 456, 467, 516-526.&nbsp;&nbsp; None&nbsp; of&nbsp; them refer to the form&nbsp; or requisites of the indorsement.&nbsp; The reason is that this article does&nbsp; not&nbsp; relate to <i>indorsement,</i> but to <i>liability.</i>&nbsp; We say&nbsp; again that this article does not begin to perform its functions <i>until after the indorsement has been made.</i>&nbsp; The article can not, therefore, be a cause contributing to the&nbsp; existence&nbsp; of&nbsp; the indorsement.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not being a&nbsp; cause contributing to&nbsp; the&nbsp; creation of the indorsement it&nbsp; can&nbsp; have no influence on&nbsp; its nature or&nbsp; requisites. If this article had wanted to make article&nbsp; 462 applicable to checks it would have read: "The&nbsp; provisions contained in this code relating&nbsp; to <i>indorsements,</i>&nbsp; etc.," and not to the "several liability of maker and indorsers."&nbsp; The article says further: "The&nbsp; provisions contained in this code relating to the&nbsp; several liability&nbsp; of the maker and&nbsp; indorsers&nbsp; and to <i>protests,</i> as well as to&nbsp; the exercise of the actions&nbsp; arising from bills of&nbsp; exchange,&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *"&nbsp;&nbsp; The articles&nbsp; of the code relating to protests are&nbsp; 502&nbsp; and following articles; and those relating to the exercise&nbsp; of actions arising froni bills of exchange are 516-526.&nbsp; Nowhere in this article is there a reference, direct or indirect, to article 462.<br><br>2. The legitimate rules of statutory construction&nbsp; do not permit the interpretation that article 462 is applicable&nbsp; to checks.<br><br>The&nbsp; primal&nbsp; type of indorsement&nbsp; provided for by the Commercial Code is not essentially different from the usual indorsement&nbsp; known to the law merchant&nbsp; the world over. It seems from a careful study of the Commercial Code that that code makes&nbsp; provisions&nbsp; for&nbsp; indorsements in special forms only where the special nature of instruments of commerce requires&nbsp; it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherever, then, we find provided by the code&nbsp; an indorsement&nbsp; having peculiar requisites and unusual features, we may confidently look for an instrument of a correspondingly peculiar nature to which that indorsement applies, and we&nbsp; may as confidently expect that such indorsement&nbsp; will be expressly restricted in its&nbsp; application to that kind&nbsp; of instrument.&nbsp; Bills of&nbsp; exchange have, under the Code of Commerce, some features not common to many other forms&nbsp; of commercial paper; and we&nbsp; find the code, therefore, providing a kind of indorsement suitable to that instrument alone.&nbsp; Articles 443 and&nbsp; 444, Title X,&nbsp; define a bill of exchange and provide what it shall contain in order to be admissible in suits.&nbsp; Articles 461 and 462 define the indorsement&nbsp; which shall be made upon a bill of exchange and the features which are essential to that indorsement. These articles, also, as we&nbsp; should expect, limit the application&nbsp; of that kind&nbsp; of&nbsp; indorsement strictly <i>and expressly to bills of exchange.&nbsp; The next subject treated by the Commercial Code, after bills of exchange, is&nbsp; that of drafts,</i> bills, and promissory notes payable to order.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Title XI, subdivision&nbsp; 1.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Article 531 defines drafts (<i>libranzas</i>), bills&nbsp; (<i>vales</i>), and promissory notes payable&nbsp; to&nbsp; order, and stipulates what features these instruments&nbsp; shall&nbsp; have in order to be such.&nbsp;&nbsp; These instruments, by their definition and requisites, approach so closely in their nature the bill of exchange,&nbsp; that they are required, for valid transfer, to have the same indorsement as a&nbsp; bill of exchange.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here again&nbsp; the&nbsp; application of article 462 to these instruments is made by <i>express provision</i> of the code (art.&nbsp; 533 above quoted).&nbsp;&nbsp; The next&nbsp; subject, immediately succeeding,&nbsp; of which the&nbsp; said code&nbsp; treats,&nbsp; is the check.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Title XI, subdivision 2.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Articles 534 and 535, above quoted,&nbsp; define a check&nbsp; and&nbsp; provide what features it shall have in order to be&nbsp; such.&nbsp;&nbsp; Article 535&nbsp; also&nbsp; provides that checks&nbsp; payable to&nbsp; order&nbsp; "shall&nbsp; be transferable by indorsement."&nbsp; Now, the code having just come from applying, by <i>express provision,</i>&nbsp; article 462 to the&nbsp; several different kinds&nbsp; of commercial instruments mentioned, would it not be reasonable to suppose&nbsp; that, if the code desired that article to&nbsp; be applied to checks,&nbsp; it would say so expressly as&nbsp; it did in the other cases?&nbsp; And is not the failure of the code to so provide the very clearest&nbsp; indication that it did not want&nbsp; such article so applied?&nbsp; In&nbsp; other words, in dealing with other instruments immediately&nbsp; preceding&nbsp; the subject of checks,&nbsp; the code,&nbsp; whenever it desired article 462 to be applicable, said <i>so expressly and in so many ivords.&nbsp; In dealing with checks it has not done so. </i> What is the inference under the common rules of statutory construction?<br><br>It is admitted that there is no provision applying article 462 to checks, such as is found in&nbsp; applying it to bills&nbsp; of exchange,&nbsp; drafts, bills,&nbsp; and promissory notes payable&nbsp; to order.&nbsp;&nbsp; The most that is claimed by&nbsp; anyone,&nbsp; and that is not claimed by the defendant Hawkes in this case, is that such an application may be figured or spelled or interpreted out of the&nbsp; provisions&nbsp; of article 542.&nbsp; That such article can not be reasonably construed&nbsp; to make such application has, we believe, been&nbsp; demonstrated heretofore.&nbsp; It remains only to say that no&nbsp; court ought to interpret into the law a requirement which has for its existence no shadow of reason and which&nbsp; serves absolutely no purpose and accomplishes no result except to render more difficult and technical the ordinary transactions of commerce and to&nbsp; dig&nbsp; one more legal pitfall into&nbsp; which the&nbsp; busy man may stumble to an expensive and fruitless litigation.&nbsp; Especially should it not do so when the party benefited by such interpretation does not ask it.<br><br>The legitimate&nbsp; rules&nbsp; of statutory&nbsp; construction&nbsp; do not permit&nbsp; the application&nbsp; of&nbsp; article 462&nbsp; to checks under the facts and circumstances of this case for the further reason that the application of said&nbsp; article is&nbsp; limited to bills of exchange by <i>express provision </i>of law.&nbsp; That being so, its application ought&nbsp; not,&nbsp; ordinarily, to be extended except by provision of law <i>equally express. </i>&nbsp; Its application ought not to be extended by interpretation or construction.&nbsp;&nbsp; Article 542&nbsp; admittedly&nbsp; does not&nbsp; expressly&nbsp; apply article&nbsp; 462 to checks.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its application is at least doubtful.&nbsp; The application of article 462, being&nbsp; limited by&nbsp; express provision of law,&nbsp; will not, under the&nbsp; circumstances of this case, be extended by article 542.<br><br>3. There&nbsp; is no&nbsp; exigency&nbsp; of business&nbsp; or&nbsp; commerce&nbsp; requiring that article 462&nbsp; should be applicable to&nbsp; checks.<br><br>The inherent&nbsp; nature of&nbsp; the provisions of article 462 of the&nbsp; Commercial&nbsp; Code&nbsp; excludes&nbsp; any&nbsp; possibility&nbsp; that the article in question&nbsp; was intended to apply to checks.&nbsp; If that article is applicable to checks at all, then every&nbsp; provision and subdivision&nbsp; thereof is applicable.&nbsp;&nbsp; If any of them are found not&nbsp; to be&nbsp; applicable,&nbsp; that&nbsp; inapplicability must be grounded in some reason.&nbsp;&nbsp; A glance at subdivisions 2 and 3 of said article indicates clearly that&nbsp; they are inapplicable to an indorsement of a check.&nbsp; No one&nbsp; pretends to claim that they are applicable.&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither of the parties&nbsp; to this action has&nbsp; dreamed of asserting the applicability of&nbsp; those subdivisions to the check in litigation.&nbsp; If subdivision 4 is applicable, why should not be subdivisions 2 and 3?&nbsp;&nbsp; There is far more reason why 2 and 3 should be applicable than why 4 should be.<br><br>While there are special reasons why the&nbsp; date should appear in the indorsement&nbsp; on a bill of exchange as provided by article 462, the reason assigned why such date should so appear is the <i>very&nbsp; reason why it should not appear in the&nbsp; indorsement&nbsp; of a&nbsp; check. </i>Article&nbsp; 466&nbsp; provides that "drafts not issued to order can not be indorsed, nor those which&nbsp; have <i>fallen&nbsp; due </i>or are&nbsp; damaged."&nbsp;&nbsp; That&nbsp; article further provides that&nbsp; "the transfer of ownership&nbsp; by the means acknowledged in the common law shall be licit; if, however, an indorsement is made it shall have no further force than that of a simple cession."&nbsp; It is evident from the provisions&nbsp; of this&nbsp; article that a person who indorses a bill&nbsp; of exchange before it is due binds himself as an indorser of the instrument by virtue of making the contract of indorsement.&nbsp; It is also&nbsp; evident that a&nbsp; person&nbsp; who indorses the instrument after it is due does not bind himself as an indorser, but merely as an assignor under the common law.&nbsp; The&nbsp; obligations&nbsp; of an&nbsp; assignor and of&nbsp; an indorser are materially different.&nbsp; Therefore&nbsp; a person who takes a bill of exchange after&nbsp; it becomes due is entitled to know which&nbsp; of the persons whose names appear upon the&nbsp; back of the bill when he takes it&nbsp; are in&nbsp; reality indorsers and which&nbsp; are merely assignors.&nbsp; In&nbsp; order that he may know this important fact, it is necessary that he know when each one of the persons made the&nbsp; indorsement which his name signifies.&nbsp; To&nbsp; give him such knowledge article 462,&nbsp; subdivision 4," provides that every person writing his name on the back of a&nbsp; bill of exchange must&nbsp; date his indorsement. The&nbsp; date&nbsp; on the indorsement is the means by which a purchaser of the bill after it&nbsp; becomes due shall .know who is liable as an&nbsp; indorser and who is&nbsp; liable as an assignor. <i>This is the only reason for the requirement that the indorsement on a bill of exchange must be dated.</i>&nbsp; It&nbsp; is evident without argument that no such reason exists in the case of a check.&nbsp; A check has no time&nbsp; within&nbsp; which it must be paid.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is payable on presentation.&nbsp; There is no interval during which the drawee of the check may prepare for its payment.&nbsp; It must be paid instantly by him on presentation. There&nbsp; is no time, so far as the question we are now discussing is concerned, during which a person who indorses a check makes the contract of assignor under the common law.&nbsp;&nbsp; A person writing&nbsp; his&nbsp; name&nbsp; across the back of a check is always an indorser no matter when he does it.&nbsp; A person who writes his&nbsp; name across the&nbsp; back of a check ten years after the check is drawn is just&nbsp; as liable as indorser as he would have been had he indorsed it on the very day of its issue; so&nbsp; that it makes no difference to a subsequent holder of a check&nbsp; on what dates were made the indorsements which appeared upon the check when he took it.&nbsp; The only thing about which&nbsp; the&nbsp; holder&nbsp; needs to be careful&nbsp; to&nbsp; protect himself is the five-day&nbsp; limit&nbsp; fixed by statute within which the check&nbsp; must be presented for payment.&nbsp; This five-day limit dates from the&nbsp; date of the <i>check</i> and not&nbsp; from the date&nbsp; of the&nbsp; indorsement.&nbsp;&nbsp; The date on which the indorsement is&nbsp; made is of no consequence whatever in this connection.<br><br>The provisions of article 462 were made applicable to drafts and promissory notes&nbsp; payable to order <i>because and only because&nbsp; they are in their nature so closely allied to a bill of exchange&nbsp; as to&nbsp; make such application necessary.</i> The provisions of said article were not made&nbsp; applicable to checks because <i>a check in many of its essential features is so different from a&nbsp; bill of exchange as to make&nbsp; such application not only unnecessary&nbsp; and useless but&nbsp; positively harmful.</i><br><br>The intention of the Code of Commerce was to furnish certain&nbsp; rules and regulations, in the form&nbsp; of law, within which commerce&nbsp; and business&nbsp; might be&nbsp; carried on with safety to the property and to the investment of every person engaged&nbsp; therein.&nbsp; In the pursuit of this purpose it was not intended, by any of those rules or regulations, to impede the free intercourse of men in&nbsp; business with&nbsp; requirements which have no reason for their existence or which serve no useful purpose.&nbsp; The&nbsp; object of the code&nbsp; was to give every opportunity possible for the free, easy, quick, and safe transaction of business,&nbsp; requiring no acts which were useless and no forms not essential.&nbsp;&nbsp; To require the indorsement of a check to be dated is to require&nbsp; something wholly unnecessary, useless,&nbsp; and burdensome.&nbsp; It would make no business transaction&nbsp; more safe.&nbsp; It would furnish no additional&nbsp; protection to any business man.&nbsp; It would serve no purpose for which laws are made.&nbsp; Its sole effect would be injurious&nbsp; because&nbsp; it does nothing1 but create&nbsp; one more useless&nbsp; restriction on business intercourse,&nbsp; introducing into the administration of the law of commerce&nbsp; one more technicality,&nbsp; now altogether too numerous,&nbsp; behind&nbsp; which those&nbsp; may take&nbsp; refuge&nbsp; who seek&nbsp; to&nbsp; evade their just responsibility.<br><br>If&nbsp; we&nbsp; should&nbsp; indulge&nbsp; the construction of&nbsp; article&nbsp; 542 adopted&nbsp; by the court&nbsp; below, we should be going counter to the known intent and&nbsp; purpose of the Commercial Code.<br><br>We&nbsp; accordingly hold that the defendant Hawkes is liable as an&nbsp; indorser.<br><br>For the reasons above expressed it is&nbsp; adjudged&nbsp; and decreed:<br><ol><li>That&nbsp; the plaintiff have judgment against&nbsp; the defendants,&nbsp; F.&nbsp; C.
