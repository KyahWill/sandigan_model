				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On the 10th of July, 1907, the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendants for the purpose of recovering a&nbsp; certain number of carabaos.<br><br>The plaintiff&nbsp; alleged that he had&nbsp; been duly appointed as administrator of the estate of Jorge Capricho, deceased, and Clemencia Morales.&nbsp; This&nbsp; fact was admitted by the defendants.&nbsp; The plaintiff claims that&nbsp; the defendants were in possession of a certain number of carabaos belonging to the estate of the said deceased, and that the defendants were illegally possessing said animals.&nbsp; The plaintiff asked that the court render a judgment against the defendants, either for the&nbsp; return of&nbsp; the&nbsp; animals or for a judgment for their value, together with a judgment for the use of said animals from some time&nbsp; in the months of November or December, 1902.<br><br>The defendants presented different answers.<br><br>After&nbsp; hearing&nbsp; the&nbsp; evidence, the lower court found that the proof adduced during the trial was insufficient to show any claim whatever on the part&nbsp; of the plaintiff against the defendant Pedro Liongson, and the cause was therefore dismissed as to him.<br><br>As to the other defendant, Mariano&nbsp; Natividad, the court found that he was in possession illegally of three carabaos of the value of P300;&nbsp; that the use of&nbsp; each&nbsp; carabao per year&nbsp; was worth P30,&nbsp; and&nbsp; rendered&nbsp; a judgment against the defendant and in favor of&nbsp; the plaintiff, ordering the defendant to return said carabaos or to pay to the plaintiff the sum&nbsp; of P300, as the value of said carabaos, and also the sum of P495 for the use of said carabaos from the month of December, 1902, and to pay the costs.<br><br>From this judgment&nbsp; the defendant,&nbsp; Mariano Natividad, appealed to this&nbsp; court&nbsp; and made several assignments of error.<br><br>From an examination of the record brought to this court, the following facts seem to be established beyond question:<br><br>First.&nbsp; That&nbsp; some&nbsp; time in the month&nbsp; of August, 1902, Jorge Capricho died&nbsp; intestate&nbsp; in the pueblo of Moriones, Province of Tarlac.<br><br>Second. That some time in the month of December, his wife, Clemencia Morales, died intestate.<br><br>Third. That&nbsp; at the time of the death of Jorge Capricho he was&nbsp; indebted to the defendant,&nbsp; Mariano&nbsp; Natividad, in the sum of&nbsp; P486.94.<br><br>Fourth. That after the death of&nbsp; Jorge Capricho and on or about the 15th of&nbsp; October, the said Mariano Natividad and&nbsp; Clemencia Morales liquidated&nbsp; the account&nbsp; which the said Natividad held against the estate of Jorge Capricho, which liquidation showed that there was&nbsp; due&nbsp; from the said estate to&nbsp; Mariano Natividad the&nbsp; sum&nbsp; of P486.94.&nbsp; This indebtedness was evidenced by a written promise&nbsp; to pay, signed by Clemencia&nbsp; Morales, and&nbsp; also a promise&nbsp; in case of failure to pay to pledge certain carabaos for the payment of the said indebtedness.<br><br>Fifth.&nbsp; That after the death&nbsp; of Clemencia&nbsp; Morales (the date does not appear of record) one Sotero&nbsp; Morales, was duly appointed as administrator of said&nbsp; estate.<br><br>Sixth.&nbsp; That on the&nbsp; 10th&nbsp; day&nbsp; of August, 1903, in&nbsp; accordance&nbsp; with the&nbsp; provisions&nbsp; of section&nbsp; 669 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions, the court appointed a committee composed of Benito Soriano and Domingo Bertram, to appraise the estate of the deceased and allow claims&nbsp; against the said estate.&nbsp;&nbsp; (See&nbsp; record, p.&nbsp; 37.)&nbsp;&nbsp; The record does not contain the report of this committee.&nbsp; It is possible that the original records&nbsp; were&nbsp; not presented as a part of the record in the present case, for the reason that&nbsp; they were burned at the time the government building in the Province of Tarlac was burned.<br><br>Seventh. The first&nbsp; administrator, Sotero Morales, presented an inventory&nbsp; of the&nbsp; property of said estate (see record, p. 48),&nbsp; on the 5th day of January, 1907.&nbsp; There is nothing in the record which shows&nbsp; why the said inventory had not been filed with the court earlier; neither does the record show whether&nbsp; or not such inventory had been filed and had been burned at the time of the&nbsp; burning of said government building.<br><br>On the same day&nbsp; (the 5th of January, 1907)&nbsp; the said administrator (Morales) rendered his final account as such administrator and asked the court&nbsp; to&nbsp; confirm&nbsp; the same in accordance with&nbsp; sections 681 and 682 of the Code&nbsp; of Procedure&nbsp; in Civil Actions.&nbsp;&nbsp; The record does&nbsp; not disclose what action the court took upon this account rendered.<br><br>The inventory presented&nbsp; by&nbsp; the administrator,&nbsp; Sotero Morales, in paragraph 8 contained a statement that there existed&nbsp; seven carabaos belonging to the&nbsp; said estate, of the value of P560.&nbsp; The said account rendered by Morales,&nbsp; in paragraph&nbsp; 5, shows&nbsp; that three of these carabaos had&nbsp; been delivered to Mariano Natividad "en garantia de una deuda," but it does not show when said carabaos had been delivered to the said Mariano Natividad.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact&nbsp; however, exists, and it is not&nbsp; denied that the carabaos were delivered by the&nbsp; administrator, Morales, to Natividad, within&nbsp; a few weeks after the death of Clemencia Morales and that the said Natividad had&nbsp; been in&nbsp; possession&nbsp; of said carabaos from that date, probably in the month of December, 1902, up to and including&nbsp; the time of the commencement of the present action&nbsp; (July 10, 1907.)<br><br>Eight. Later Sotero&nbsp; Morales&nbsp; died; the&nbsp; exact date&nbsp; does not appear, and the plaintiff herein was appointed as administrator of said&nbsp; estate.&nbsp;&nbsp; The date of the appointment of the plaintiff does not appear.&nbsp; Exhibit A, which is alleged to have been a copy of his appointment, does not appear in the record.<br><br>The contention&nbsp; of&nbsp; the plaintiff is&nbsp; that&nbsp; Sotero&nbsp; Morales, the first administrator, had no authority to pay the claim of Mariano Natividad against the estate, by delivering&nbsp; to him the carabaos in question, without the express permission of the court.&nbsp; This contention of the plaintiff is valid, The plaintiff contends that&nbsp; it was the duty&nbsp; of&nbsp; Mariano Morales, if he had a claim&nbsp; against the estate&nbsp; in question, to have presented it to the committee appointed for the purpose of allowing claims.&nbsp; This contention of the plaintiff is also valid.&nbsp; It is not disputed, however,&nbsp; by the plaintiff that the carabaos were turned over to Natividad&nbsp; by the first administrator, Sotero Morales, and accepted by Natividad in good faith, believing that&nbsp; the carabaos&nbsp; had been turned&nbsp; over to him in&nbsp; part payment of his claim against the said estate.&nbsp; Sotero Morales, in his&nbsp; account rendered makes&nbsp; the statement&nbsp; that&nbsp; there were&nbsp; no debts existing against the said estate.&nbsp; (See record, p. 50.)<br><br>The simple question presented by the record is - Can an administrator maintain an action to recover personal property belonging to&nbsp; an estate, which has been in the possession of the defendant for a period of more than four years, he possessing the same in good faith?&nbsp; The defendant had held the property continuously from&nbsp; probably&nbsp; some&nbsp; time in the month of December, 1902, (certainly not later)&nbsp; up to and&nbsp; including&nbsp; the&nbsp; time of the&nbsp; commencement&nbsp; of the present action, July 10, 1907, and no question&nbsp; is&nbsp; raised here that the defendant did&nbsp; not possess the property in question in good&nbsp; faith.&nbsp; Article&nbsp; 1955 of&nbsp; the Civil&nbsp; Code provides that&nbsp; "The ownership of&nbsp; personal property prescribes&nbsp; by uninterrupted possession in&nbsp; good faith,&nbsp; for a period of three years."&nbsp; Paragraph 3 of section 43 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions provides that an action for the recovery of personal&nbsp; property shall be limited to four years. Without,&nbsp; at this&nbsp; time, attempting to discuss the effect of the&nbsp; provisions of said section&nbsp; 43&nbsp; upon the provisions&nbsp; of said section 1955 of the Civil Code, and expressly&nbsp; reserving&nbsp; that&nbsp; question for future discussion, we are of the opinion and&nbsp; so hold that under the facts in the present case, the right of the&nbsp; plaintiff to recover the carabaos in question can not be sustained, and therefore the judgment of the lower court is hereby reversed, and without any special finding as to costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Carson,</i> and <i>Moreland, JJ.</i>, concur.<br></div>
