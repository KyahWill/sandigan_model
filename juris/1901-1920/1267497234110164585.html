				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Pow Sing, the appellant herein, together with one Simeon Vega, was charge with&nbsp; the&nbsp; illegal&nbsp; importation&nbsp; into the Philippine Islands of some 336 grams morphine.&nbsp; The information, which was presented by one of the attorneys of the office of the prosecuting attorney for the city of Manila, was as&nbsp; follows:&nbsp; <blockquote><p>"The undersigned&nbsp; charges&nbsp; Pow Sing and Simeon Vega with the crime of illegal importation, committed as follows:&nbsp; </p><p>"That on or about September 2,&nbsp; 1911, in, the city&nbsp; of Manila, Philippine and in Manila&nbsp; Bay, within two and a half miles of the seashore of the cit Manila and within the jurisdiction of this court, the said Pow Sing and Si Vega&nbsp; did willfully, illegally, criminally and fraudulently, and knowingly conspiring and&nbsp; plotting between themselves, import and introduce into the Philippine Islands from a foreign country, and&nbsp; aid in the&nbsp; importation an introduction&nbsp; into the Philippine&nbsp; Islands&nbsp; from a foreign country, in violation of law, effects, articles and merchandise, to wit: opium and a derivative of that is, three hundred and thirty-six (336)&nbsp; grams of morphine,&nbsp; worth approximately two hundred pesos (P200), Philippine&nbsp; currency; and at said time and place the&nbsp; said Pow Sing and Simeon Vega,&nbsp; conspiring and plotting among themselves, did receive, hide, and aid in receiving and hiding said morphine, after it&nbsp; had been imported, knowing that said morphine had been illegally imported into the Philippine Islands from a foreign country."</p></blockquote><p>Simeon&nbsp; Vega was granted a separate trial on motion of his attorney.&nbsp; He was found guilty as charged and sentenced to pay a fine of P50, and the payment of one half of the costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; From&nbsp; this judgment and sentence he did not appeal.&nbsp; The appellant herein, Pow Sing, was found guilty as charged i the information and sentenced to pay a fine of Pl,200,&nbsp; and to the payment of one half of the&nbsp; costs. From this&nbsp; judgment and sentence the present appeal is prosecuted.</p><p>The evidence of record establishes that the steamer <i>Loongsang</i>&nbsp; was anchored in Manila Bay&nbsp; on&nbsp; September 2,&nbsp; 1911, having just recently arrived from Hongkong, and&nbsp; that two men had been sent by the customs officials to keep a close watch on the ship with a view of preventing the landing therefrom any contraband articles or goods of any character, and that for this purpose the men had stationed themselves in a casco moored alongside a lorcha, the latter being alongside and fastened to the steamer <em>Loongsang.</em> About 2.30 on the afternoon of September 2, 1911, after the men had been watching for several hours, they observed the appellant Pow&nbsp; Sing deliver&nbsp; a&nbsp; package to the defendant Simeon Vega, and the latter immediately started down from the ship into the <i>lorcha </i>by means of a rope.&nbsp;&nbsp; The officers who had been watching forthwith rushed upon, the <i>lorcha </i>and arrested Vega and seized th e package which&nbsp; at that time was supposed to contain lottery tickets.&nbsp; Upon examination later, however, the contents proved to be some 336 grains of morphine. One of the officers immediately&nbsp; went upon the ship and effected the arrest of Pow Sing, who was the steward of the <em>Loongsang.</em>&nbsp; The steamer <em>Loongsang</em> had just arrived from Hongkong&nbsp; and the morphine contained in the package taken from Vega was&nbsp; not manifested in the ship's cargo,&nbsp; nor was it included&nbsp; among or entered upon the ship's store provisions.</p><p>The appellant denied&nbsp; that he had delivered the package to Vega, and claimed that at the time he was arrested he had just come from his room where he had been asleep, and that he had been called by an employee who said that some of the passengers wanted some&nbsp; drinks.</p><p>Two other Chinos testified that Pow Sing had been asleep, and further&nbsp; that they&nbsp; had seen one&nbsp; Tat&nbsp; Wing, another member of the crew, give a package to Simeon Vega.</p><p>This&nbsp; constitutes practically&nbsp; all the testimony upon this point.&nbsp; The who seems to turn on the&nbsp; question of the credibility of&nbsp; the witnesses.&nbsp; The customs officials testified positively and directly upon this point.&nbsp; Both stated that they saw the appellant Pow Sing deliver the package in question to Simeon Vega, and the trial judge commenting upon this point said that their testimony was given in such a way as to bring conviction that they w telling the truth; and added that it was easy to see that the witnesses for defense were not telling the truth.</p><p>As the fiscal points out, this court has repeatedly held that since the trial court enjoys exceptional advantages for determining&nbsp; and passing upon the credible of opposing witnesses testifying in&nbsp; his&nbsp; presence, such conclusions as the court may reach&nbsp; in regard thereto will not be disturbed unless the record clearly indicates that the trial court has fallen into error, or failed t consideration some&nbsp; material matter which should have led him to arrive at different conclusion.&nbsp; (See U. S. <em>vs.</em> Benitez and Lipia, 18 Phil. R Other question&nbsp; are raised by counsel for appellant in his brief, but these to be very conclusively answered by the fiscal.</p><p>We find no errors&nbsp; in the proceedings prejudicial to the rights of the accused and we are satisfied beyond a reasons able doubt as&nbsp; to the guilt of the appellant of the&nbsp; crime of which he was convicted.&nbsp; The trial court&nbsp; sentenced the convict to a fine of P1,200,&nbsp; and the payment of one-half of the costs of the&nbsp; proceedings, but following the practice indicated in the case of <em>vs.</em> Castaneda et al.&nbsp; (18 Phil. Rep., 58)&nbsp; and&nbsp; U. S. <em>vs</em>. Li 7428),&nbsp; recently decided,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> we think that a&nbsp; prison sentence should be&nbsp; add this case, it appearing&nbsp; that the convict&nbsp; was engaged in the&nbsp; illegal importation of the drug.&nbsp;&nbsp; As we stated in the decision just cited, "mere however large,&nbsp; do not seem to serve as a sufficient deterrent to offender this class, doubtless because the illicit gains from&nbsp; the traffic in the d great, while the chances of detection and punishment are in most instances few as a result&nbsp; of the comparatively small bulk of the contraband article"</p><p>The judgment of conviction of the court below is affirmed, and&nbsp; the&nbsp; sentenced imposed upon the convict, modified by the addition of six months' imprisonment, is also affirmed, with the costs of both instances against t appellant.</p><p><em>Arellano,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J.,&nbsp; Torres, Mapa,&nbsp; Johnson,</em> and <em>Trent JJ</em>.. concur.<br><br><br></p><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="left"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1] </sup><span style="font-style: italic;">See</span> post.<br></div>
