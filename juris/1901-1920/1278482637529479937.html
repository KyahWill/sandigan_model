of the provisions of law. Upon the oomplaint he was duly arrested, arraigned, 
tried, found guilty and sentenced to pay a fine of P300.00 and the costs, and in 
case of insolvency to suffer subsidiary imprisonment in accordance with the 
provisions of the law. From that sentence the defendant appealed to this 
court.
<p>In this court the defendant alleges that the proof adduced during the trial 
of the cause was insufficient to show that he was guilty of the crime charged in 
the complaint.</p>
<p>After a careful examination of the evidence brought to this oourt, we are 
persuaded, beyond a reasonable doubt,that the defendant, on or about the 9th day 
of October 1913, in the City of Manila, did then and there unlawfully have in 
his possession and under his control 2 grams and 50 centigrams of of morphine, 
in violation of the provisions of the Opium Law. We find no reason for changing 
or modifying the sentence of the lower court. The same is therefore hereby 
affirmed witn costs.</p>
<p>It is so ordered</p>
<p>After the expiration of 10 days from the date hereof let judgment be entered 
in aooordance herewith, and<br>10 days thereafter let the record be returned to 
the courtfrom whence it came, for execution.<br></p></div>
