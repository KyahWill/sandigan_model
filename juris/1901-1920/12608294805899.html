				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On the 14th  of December, 1906, the provincial  fiscal of Ilocos Norte filed a complaint with the Court of First Instance of said  province accusing Justo Dacuycuy of the crime of estafa, committed as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"That in the  month of February, 1906, the said accused, being a public official and taking advantage of his office of councilor for the  municipality of  Bacarra, Province of Ilocos Norte, then and  there willfully  and  feloniously received the sum  of ?=39 from  residents of his  district named Angelo  Jose, Julian Nacuray, Gabriel Galamay, Alipio Galviso, Silverio Jose, Vicente Gervasio, Pedro Dumingsil, Julian Rivera,  Atanasio Perito, Martin  Vea, Martin Jose, Juan Sina, Cirilo Ramil, Simon Jose, Alejandro Salacup, Estanislao Galamay, Castor Vea,  Ignacio Salacup, Bernardo Edralin, Luis Jose, Cosme Ramoran, Pedro  Garcia, Eugenio Aquino, Ciriaco Bolosan, Eugenio Nacuray, Juan Nacuray, Casimiro  Pascua,  Segundo Galamay, Gabino  Galamay,  Isidoro Ramo, Tomas Galisinao, Domingo Butac, Catalino Acoba, Bonifacio Mercado, Procopio Galviso, Leon Ramoran,  Juan Butac, Tomas Butac, and  Cesario  Gapusan, for the purpose of investing the money in cedulas,  and, notwithstanding several requests made of him, he failed to invest said sum in  cedulas  or return the same to the owners thereof, and misapplied it and converted it to his own use  to the prejudice of the above-named  individuals.   Said facts constitute the crime defined and punished under article 399 in connection with article 535, No. 5, of the Penal Code, committed within the jurisdiction of  this Court of First Instance.  All contrary to law."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Proceedings having  been  instituted, by  virtue of the foregoing complaint, judgment was rendered by the court on the 4th of February,  1907, sentencing  the  accused  to the penalty of two months and one day of arresto mayor. to suffer the accessory penalties, to indemnify 23 individuals residing in the barrio of Oangagan, town of Bacarra, of said province, in the sum of P40, at the rate of P2 each, and in case of insolvency to suffer the subsidiary imprisonment of one day for every 12| pesetas unpaid, to temporary special disqualification from public office during ten years and one day, and to pay  the  costs of the proceedings. From this sentence the accused  has appealed.</p>
<p>At the time when Justo Dacuycuy was enjoying a vacation at the barrio of Oangagan, town of Bacarra, in the early part of February, 1900,  the 39  individuals whose names appear in  the complaint,  upon  being informed through the accused that cedulas had been received at the municipality, delivered to him the sum of P39, asking him to obtain an  equal number of  cedulas, one  for each of them, so as to save them from  having  to travel  the long distance to the  town, inasmuch as he  had, as councilor, done  the same thing in former years.   The accused, however,  after receiving the money, limited himself to taking out 10 cedulas for as many taxpayers, and appropriated the balance of ^23, and, notwithstanding the repeated requests made by  the 23 taxpayers who  were still without cedulas,  he failed  to either obtain them or return  the money, telling them not to wrorry, as they would eventually receive their cedulas.  The term fixed by law for the pay ment of the cedula  tax  elapsed, and  the aforesaid 23 residents were obliged to take out their  respective cedulas with a surcharge on  account of the delay, each of  them paying the cost thereof.</p>
<p>After Silverio Jose,  one of  the  injured parties,  had testified in the ease, it was agreed between the provincial fiscal  and the counsel for the accused that, if all the other witnesses who handed their money to the accused for the purchase of a cedula were to give evidence, their declarations would conform to that made by the only witness who testified in  the case.</p>
<p>In his testimony the accused confessed  to having received from several residents of the barrio on the 2d of February, 1900, the said sum of P39 to purchase an equal number of cedulas, but denied that he had gone over to the said barrio in order to collect taxes, and further stated that he was there enjoying a vacation when the residents handed him the money for the purchase of their respective cedulas, but municipal treasury one person was not permitted to take out a cedula for another. The accused, however, afterwards managed  to obtain 16  cedulas  for as many  individuals,  and  appropriated  the  remaining  P23  which belonged to 23 taxpayers who had to purchase1 and pay for their respective  cedillas with  the surcharge  incurred  on account of the expiration of the time iixed by  law.  When the accused was unable to refund the money lie had appropriated he advised tlie persons interested to procure money with  which to purchase  cedillas  and agreed to pay the same later on.</p>
<p>Probably in order to avoid a repetition by  the other witnesses of the testimony given by Silverio Jose, the only witness who testified for the  prosecution, following the practice in civil  cases, a compromise was entered into  by the parties.  The law, however, does not authorize this practice in criminal proceedings, but considering that the testimony of the sole witness is fully corroborated  by the declaration  of  the  accused,  who confessed to having received the  said sum  to be invested in cedillas, of which he only obtained 10, and then kept the P23 remaining, to the prejudice  of the 23 taxpayers, who had to procure them  with a  surcharge  and again to pay for them, one is convinced that Justo Dacuvcuv  committed the crime  of estafa defined  and  punished  under articles 534 and  535, No. 5, of the Penal Code.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the fact that the accused  pleaded not guilty, his culpability as the convicted author of said crime has been fully established, his exculpatory allegation  that at the municipal treasury one person was not permitted to obtain a cedula for another being inadmissible, in  view of the fact that he secured 16 cedulas,  and even if it were true it would never  under any consideration justify his appropriating the sum of P23 to the detriment  of the injured parties.</p>
<p>Whenever a  public official commits a crime outside  of in order to collect taxes,  and further stated that he was there enjoying a vacation when the residents handed him the money for the purchase of their respective cedulas, but that he  was unable  to  get the cedillas because at the municipal treasury one person  was not permitted to take out a cedula for another.  The accused, however, after the exercise of  his  functions,  doing acts  which are not connected with the duties of his office, he should be punished with  the penalty provided by  law for the  private individual who violates its provisions, without taking into account the official  character with which  the accused  is invested.</p>
<p>The accused was a councilor of the municipality at the time when the crime  was committed, although undoubtedly it was not in his province nor did it form a part of his official duties to collect the cedula  tax.  If because he inspired them with  confidence  it was an easy matter for him to collect from  the said 39 residents the P39  for the purchase of cedulas  in view of  his character of councilor, this circumstance  constitutes in this case one of the elements of  the crime of estafa, since he took  advantage thereof in consummating the crime;  but, considering that he committed the crime as a private individual, it is not proper to  impose on him the penalty provided by article 399 of the code for public officers, because he received  said amount not in the exercise  of his functions as councilor, though he abused the confidence of the said 39 taxpayers; hence the accused should be punished as a private individual, guilty of the crime of estafa, with  the penalty of arresto mwyor in its minimum and  medium degrees, imposed in the medium period on account of the amount misappropriated, because in the commission  of the crime neither an  aggravating nor a mitigating circumstance  is present.</p>
<p>Therefore, in view of the considerations above set forth, it is our opinion that the judgment appealed from should be reversed  and Justo Dacuycuy sentenced to the penalty of two months and one day  of arresto mayor with  the accessory penalties of  article 61,  to make restitution of the sum of P46 to the 23 persons  prejudiced,  at the rate of P2 to each of them, and in case of insolvency to suffer the corresponding subsidiary  imprisonment, and to pay the costs in both instances.  So ordered.</p>
