				<BR><STRONG>FISHER, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal by defendant from a judgment of the Court of First Instance 
of Manila by which he was enjoined for a term of five years, from September 10, 
1915, from engaging in the Philippine Islands in any business similar to or 
competitive with that of plaintiff.
<p>The record discloses that plaintiff is and for a long time past has been 
engaged in the city of Manila and elsewhere in the Philippine Islands in the 
business of manufacturing ladies' embroidered underwear for export. Plaintiff 
imports the material from which this underwear is made and adopts decorative 
designs which are embroidered upon it by Filipino needle workers from patterns 
selected and supplied by him. Most of the embroidery work is done in the homes 
of the workers. The embroidered material is then returned to plaintiff's factory 
in Manila where it is made into finished garments and prepared for export. The 
embroiderers employed by plaintiff are under contract to work for plaintiff 
exclusively. Some fifteen thousand home workers and eight hundred factory 
workers are engaged in this work for plaintiff, and some two and a half million 
pesos are invested in his business.</p>
<p>On September 10, 1915, plaintiff and defendant entered into a contract in the 
following terms:</p>
<p>"Contract of agreement made and entered into this date by and between William 
Ollendorff, of Manila, Philippine Islands, party of the first part, and Ira 
Abrahamson, of Manila, Philippine Islands, party of the second part:</p>
<p>"The party of the first part hereby agrees to employ the party of the second 
part, and the party of the second part hereby obligates and binds himself to 
work for the party of the first part for a term of two years from date 
commencing from the sixth day of September, one thousand nine hundred and 
fifteen and ending on the fifth day of September, one thousand nine hundred 
seventeen, at a salary of fifty pesos (P50) per week payable at the end of each 
week.</p>
<p>"The party of the second part hereby obligates and binds himself to devote 
his entire time, attention, energies and industry to the promotion and the 
furtherance of the business and interests of the party of the first part and to 
perform during the term of this contract such duties as may be assigned to him 
by the party of the first part, and failure by said party of the second part to 
comply with these conditions to the satisfaction of the party of the first part 
shall entitle the party of the first part to forthwith terminate this contract 
without notice and to discharge and dismiss the said party of the second part 
from the employ of the party of the first part.</p>
<p>"It is mutually understood and agreed by the parties hereto that this 
contract, upon its termination, may be extended for a like, a longer or a 
shorter period by the mutual consent of both contracting parties.</p>
<p>"The said party of the second part hereby further binds and obligates 
himself, his heirs, successors and assigns, that he will not enter into or 
engage himself directly or indirectly, nor permit any other person under his 
control to enter in or engage in a similar or competitive business to that of 
the said party of the first part anywhere within the Philippine Islands for a 
period of five years from this date."</p>
<p>Under the terms of this, agreement defendant entered the employ of plaintiff 
and worked for him until April, 1916, when defendant, on account of ill health, 
left plaintiff's employ and went to the United States. While in plaintiffs 
employ defendant had access to all parts of plaintiff's establishment, and had 
full opportunity to acquaint himself with plaintiff's business methods and 
business connections. The duties performed by him were such as to make it 
necessary that he should have this knowledge of plaintiff's business. Defendant 
had a general knowledge of the Philippine embroidery business before his 
employment by plaintiff, having been engaged in similar work for several 
years.</p>
<p>Some months after his departure for the United States, defendant returned to 
Manila as the manager of the Philippine Underwear Company, a corporation. This 
corporation does not maintain a factory in the Philippine Islands, but sends 
material and embroidery designs from New York to its local representative here 
who employs Filipino needle workers to embroider the designs and make up the 
garments in their homes. The only difference between plaintiff's business and 
that of the firm by which the defendant is employed, is the method of doing the 
finishing workâ€” the manufacture of the embroidered material into finished 
garments. Defendant admits that both firms turn out the same class of goods and 
that they are exported to the same market. It also clearly appears from the 
evidence that defendant has employed to work for his firm some of the same 
workers employed by the plaintiff.</p>
<p>Shortly after defendant's return to Manila and the commencement by him of the 
discharge of the duties of his position as local manager of the Philippine 
Embroidery Company, plaintiff commenced this action, the principal purpose of 
which is to prevent, by injunction, any further breach of that part of 
defendant's contract of employment by plaintiff, by which he agreed that he 
would not "enter into or engage himself directly or indirectly * * * in a 
similar or competitive business to that of (plaintiff) anywhere within the 
Philippine Islands for a period of five years * * *" from the date of the 
agreement. The lower court granted a preliminary injunction, and upon trial the 
injunction was made perpetual.</p>
<p>Defendant, as appellant, argues that plaintiff failed to substantiate the 
averments of his complaint to the effect that the business in which the 
defendant is employed is competitive with that of plaintiff. The court below 
found from the evidence that the business was "very similar." We have examined 
the evidence and are of the opinion that the business in which defendant is 
engaged is not only "very similar" to that of plaintiff, but that it is 
conducted in open competition with that business within the meaning of the 
contract in question. Defendant himself expressly admitted, on 
cross-examination, that the firm by which he is now employed "puts out the same 
class of goods" as that which plaintiff is engaged in producing. When two 
concerns operate in the same field, produce the same class of goods and dispose 
of them in the same market, their businesses are of necessity competitive. 
Defendant having engaged in the Philippine Islands in a business directly 
competitive with that of plaintiff, within five years from the date of his 
contract of employment by plaintiff, under the terms of which he expressly 
agreed that he would refrain from doing that very thing, his conduct constitutes 
a breach of that agreement.</p>
<p>Defendant argues that even assuming that there has been a breach of the 
agreement, the judgment of the court below is nevertheless erroneous, contending 
that (1) the contract is void for lack of mutuality; (2) that the contract is 
void as constituting an unreasonable restraint of trade; (3) that plaintiff has 
failed to show that he has suffered any estimable pecuniary damage; and (4) that 
even assuming that such damage has been caused, the injury is not of such a 
character as to warrant the court in restraining by injunction its 
continuance.</p>
<p>The contention that the contract is void for lack of mutuality is based upon 
that part of the agreement which authorizes plaintiff to discharge the defendant 
before the expiration of the stipulated term, should defendant fail to comply 
with its conditions to plaintiff's satisfaction. It is argued that by this 
contract it was sought to impose upon defendant the absolute obligation of 
rendering service, while reserving to plaintiff the right to rescind it at will. 
We are of the opinion that this question is largely academic. It is admitted 
that defendant left plaintiff's employ at his own request before the expiration 
of the stipulated term of the contract. Had plaintiff sought to discharge 
defendant without just cause, before the expiration of the term of the 
employment, it might have been a serious question whether he could lawfully do 
so, notwithstanding the terms in which the contract was drawn. (Civil Code, art. 
1256.) But even assuming this particular clause of the contract to be invalid, 
this would not necessarily affect the rest of the agreement. The inclusion in an 
agreement of one or more pacts which are invalid does not of necessity 
invalidate the whole contract.</p>
<p>We are of the opinion that the contract was not void as constituting an 
unreasonable restraint of trade. We have been cited to no statutory expression 
of the legislative will to which such an agreement is directly obnoxious. The 
rule in this jurisdiction is that the obligations created by contracts have the 
<em>force of law</em> between the contracting parties and must be enforced in 
accordance with their tenor. (Civil Code, art. 1091.) The only limitation upon 
the freedom of contractual agreement is that the pacts established shall not be 
contrary to "law, morals or public order." (Civil Code, art. 1255.) The industry 
of counsel has failed to discover any direct expression of the legislative will 
which prohibits such a contract as that before us. It certainly is not contrary 
to any recognized moral precept, and it therefore only remains to consider 
whether it is contrary to "public order." This term, as correctly stated by 
Manresa (Commentaries, vol. 8, p. 606) "does not mean, as here used, the actual 
keeping of the public peace, but signifies the public weal * * * that which is 
permanent and essential in institutions * * *." It is the equivalent, as here 
used and as defined by Manresa, of the term "public policy" as used in the law 
of the United States. Public policy has been defined as being that principle 
under which freedom of contract or private dealing is restricted for the good of 
the community. (People's Bank <em>vs</em>. Dalton, 2 Okla., 476.) It is upon 
this theory that contracts between private individuals which result in an 
unreasonable restraint of trade have frequently been declared void by the 
American courts. The same principle being recognized by article 1255 of our 
Civil Code, the courts of these Islands are vested with like authority.</p>
<p>In the nature of things, it is imposible to frame a general rule by which to 
determine in advance the precise point at which the right of freedom of contract 
must yield to the superior interest of the community in keeping trade and 
commerce free from unreasonable restrictions. Originally the English courts 
adopted the view that any agreement which imposed restrictions upon a man's 
right to exercise his trade or calling was void as against public policy. (Cyc. 
vol. 9, p. 525.) In the course of time this opinion was abandoned and the 
American and English courts adopted the doctrine that where the restraint was 
unlimited as to both time and space it was void, but that agreements limited as 
to time but unlimited as to space, or limited as to space but unlimited as to 
time were valid. In recent years there has been a tendency on the part of the 
courts of England and America to discard these fixed rules and to decide each 
case according to its peculiar circumstances, and make the validity of the 
restraint depend upon its reasonableness. If the restraint is no greater than is 
reasonably necessary for the protection of the party in whose favor it is 
imposed it is upheld, but if it goes beyond this it is declared void. This is 
the principle followed in such cases by the Supreme Court of the United States. 
In the case of Gibbs <em>vs</em>. Consolidated Gas Co. of Baltimore (130 U. S., 
396) the court said:</p>
<p>"The decision in Mitchel <em>vs</em>. Reynolds (1 P. Wms., 181 [Smith's 
Leading Cases, Vol. 1, Pt. II, 508]), is the foundation of the rule in relation 
to the invalidity of contracts in restraint of trade; but as it was made under a 
condition of things, and a state of society, different from those which now 
prevail, the rule laid down is not regarded as inflexible, and has been 
considerably modified. Public welfare is first considered, and if it be not 
involved, and the restraint upon one party is not greater than protection to the 
other party requires, the contract may be sustained. The question is, whether, 
under the particular circumstances of the case and the nature of the particular 
contract involved in it, the contract is, or is not, unreasonable. (Rousillon 
<em>vs</em>. Rousillon, L. R. 14 Ch. Div., 351; Leather Cloth Co. <em>vs</em>. 
Lorsont, L. R. 9 Eq., 345.)"</p>
<p>Following this opinion, we adopt the modern rule that the validity of 
restraints upon trade or employment is to be determined by the intrinsic 
reasonableness of the restriction in each case, rather than by any fixed rule, 
and that such restrictions may be upheld when not contrary to the public welfare 
and not greater than is necessary to afford a fair and reasonable protection to 
the party in whose favor it is imposed.</p>
<p>Examining the contract here in question from this standpoint, it does not 
seem to us to be obnoxious to the rule of reasonableness. While such a 
restraint, if imposed as a condition of the employment of a day laborer, would 
at once be rejected as merely arbitrary and wholly unnecessary to the protection 
of the employer, it does not seem so with respect to an employee whose duties 
are such as of necessity to give him an insight into the general scope and 
details of his employer's business. A business enterprise may and often does 
depend for its success upon the owner's relations with other dealers, his skill 
in establishing favorable connections, his methods of buying and sellingâ€” a 
multitude of details, none vital if considered alone, but which in the aggregate 
constitute the sum total of the advantages which are the result of the 
experience or individual aptitude and ability of the man or men by whom the 
business has been built up. Failure or success may depend upon the possession of 
these intangible but all-important assets, and it is natural that their 
possessor should seek to keep them from falling into the hands of his 
competitors. It is with this object in view that such restrictions as that now 
under consideration are written into contracts of employment. Their purpose is 
the protection of the employer, and if they do not go beyond what is reasonably 
necessary to effectuate this purpose they should be upheld. We are of the 
opinion, and so hold, that in the light of the established facts the restraint 
imposed upon defendant by his contract is not unreasonable. As was well said in 
the case of Underwood <em>vs</em>. Barker (68 Law J. Ch., 201). "If there is one 
thing more than another which is essential to the trade and commerce of this 
country, it is the inviolability of contracts deliberately entered into; and to 
allow a person of mature age, and not imposed upon, to enter into a contract, to 
obtain the benefit of.it, and then to repudiate it and the obligation which he 
has undertaken, is prima facie, at all events, contrary to the interests of any 
and every country * * *. The public policy which allows a person to obtain 
employment on certain terms understood by and agreed to by him, and to repudiate 
his contract, conflicts with, and must, to avail the defendant, for some 
sufficient reason, prevail over, the manifest public policy, which, as a rule 
holds him to his bond * * *."</p>
<p>Having held that the contract is valid, we pass to a consideration of 
defendant's objections to its enforcement by injunction.</p>
<p>It is contended that plaintiff has not proved that he has suffered any 
estimable pecuniary damage by reason of defendant's breach of the contract, and 
that for that reason his action must fail. It is further contended that in no 
event is it proper to enforce such a contract as this by injunction, because it 
has not been alleged and proved that the continuance of the acts complained of 
will cause plaintiff "irreparable damage." These objections can conveniently be 
considerated together.</p>
<p>The obligation imposed upon defendant by the particular clause of his 
contract now under consideration is negative in character. Unless defendant 
voluntarily complies with his undertaking there is no way by which the contract 
can be enforced except by the injunctive power of judicial process. Such 
negative obligations have long been enforced by the courts in this manner. As 
stated by High in his well known work on Injunctions (vol. 2, pp. 877-878):</p>
<p>"The remedy by injunction to prevent the violation of negative agreements, or 
contracts not to do a particular thing, is closely akin to the remedy by way of 
specific performance of agreements of an affirmative nature. In both cases the 
object sought is substantially one and the same, and by enjoining the violation 
of a negative agreement the court of equity in effect decrees its specific 
performance. (Lumley <em>vs</em>. Wagner, 1 DeGex, M. &amp; G., 604.)"</p>
<p>Where by the terms of a contract imposing a positive obligation the obligor 
is entitled to a specific performance, it will not avail the defendant to show 
that plaintiff will suffer nor pecuniary damage if the contract is not 
performed. Upon like reason, when the undertaking is negative in character and 
defendant is violating the obligation imposed upon him the court may interfere 
without requiring proof of actual damage. (High on Injunctions, par. 1135, 
citing Dickenson <em>vs</em>. Grand Junction Canal Co., 15 Beav., 270.)</p>
<p>The admitted fact that plaintiff has failed to establish proof of pecuniary 
damage by reason of the breach of the contract by defendant by the acts 
committed prior to the issuance of the preliminary injunction is, of course, a 
bar to any money judgment for damages for the breach of the contract, but will 
not justify us in permitting defendant to <em>continue</em> to break his 
contract over plaintiff's objection. The injury is a continuous one. The fact 
that the court may not be able to give damages for that part of the breach of 
the contract which had already taken place when its aid was invoked is no reason 
why it should countenance a continuance of such disregard of plaintiff's 
rights.</p>
<p>With respect to the contention that an injunction may only be granted to 
prevent irreparable injury, the answer is that any continuing breach of a valid 
negative covenant is irreparable by the ordinary process of courts of law. As 
stated by High, (vol. 2, p. 906) injunctive relief is granted in cases like this 
"upon the ground that the parties cannot be placed <em>in statu quo</em>, and 
that damages at law can afford no adequate compensation, the injury being a 
continuous one <em>irreparable</em> by the ordinary process of courts of 
law."</p>
<p>In the case of Gilchrist <em>vs</em>. Cuddy (29 Phil. Rep., 542), at page 
552, this court said, citing with approval the case of Wahle <em>vs</em>. 
Reinbach (76 111., 322) :</p>
<p>"By 'irreparable injury' is not meant such injury as is beyond the 
possibility of repair, or beyond possible compensation in damages, nor 
necessarily great injury or great damage, but that species of injury, whether 
great or small, that ought not to be submitted to on the one hand or inflicted 
on the other; and, because it is so large on the one hand, or so small on the 
other, is of such <em>constant and frequent </em>recurrence that no fair or 
reasonable redress can be had therefor in a court of law."</p>
<p>This definition was quoted with approval by the Supreme Court of the United 
States in the case of Donovan <em>vs</em>. Pennsylvania Co., (199 U. S., 279), 
in which the injury complained of was continuous in its nature.</p>
<p>It is true, as held in the case of Liongson vs. Martinez (36 Phil. Rep., 948) 
that "an injunction should never issue when an action for damages would 
adequately compensate the injuries caused" but it frequently happens that the 
acts of the defendant, while constituting a very substantial invasion of 
plaintiff's rights are of such a character that the damages which result 
therefrom "cannot be measured by any certain pecuniary standard." (Eau Claire 
Water Co. <em>vs</em>. City of Eau Claire, 127 Wis., 154.) The Civil Code (art. 
1908) casts upon real estate owners liability in damages for the emission, upon 
their premises, of "excessive smoke, which may be noxious to person or 
property." The injury eaused by such a nuisance might bring about a depreciation 
in the value of adjoining properties, but there is no "<em>certain pecuniary 
standard</em>" by which such damages can be measured, and in that sense the 
threatened injury is "irreparable" and may appropriately be restrained by 
injunction.</p>
<p>"* * * If the nuisance js a continuing one, invading substantial rights of 
the complainant in such a manner that he would thereby lose such rights entirely 
but for the assistance of a court of equity he will be entitled to an injunction 
upon a proper showing, notwithstanding the fact that he might recover some 
damages in an action at law." (Tise <em>vs</em>. Whitaker-Harvey Co., 144 N. C, 
507.)</p>
<p>The injury done the business of a merchant by illegal or unfair competition 
is exceedingly difficult to measure. A diminution of the volume of a business 
<em>may</em> be due to so many different causes that it is often impossible to 
demonstrate that it has in fact been caused by the illegal competition of the 
defendant. This is frequently the case in suit for the infringement of trademark 
rights, in which the courts may enjoin the continued use of the infringing mark, 
although unable to assess damages for the past injury.</p>
<p>The judgment of the trial court is affirmed with costs. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson, Street</em>, and <em>AvanceÃ±a, 
JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Malcolm, J.</em>, concurs in the result.</p></div>
