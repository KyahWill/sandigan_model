				G.R. No. 9307, March 19, 1914</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. FRANCISCO GARCIA ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>TRENT, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">An appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance condemning the 
appellants, Francisco Garcia and Ursula Buan, the first to one year eight months 
and twenty-one days of <em>prision correccional,</em> and the second to two 
years four months and one day of <em>destierro,</em> and each to pay one-half 
the costs of the cause, for the crime of concubinage.
<p>The testimony of record shows that the appellant Francisco Garcia abandoned 
his lawful wife, Benita Dizon, and took unto himself the other appellant as his 
concubine. The two appellants for a long time prior to the institution of this 
action were living together openly, publicly, and scandalously as man and wife. 
As a result of this union Buan gave birth to a child.</p>
<p>Benita Dizon filed in the justice of the peace court on December 23, 1911, a 
formal complaint, which was sworn to, against these two appellants charging them 
with having violated the provisions of article 437 of the Penal Code. A 
preliminary investigation was held, and the justice of the peace, finding that a 
crime had been committed and that there was probable cause to believe that these 
appellants had committed the crime, issued an order directing them to appear 
before the Court of First Instance to answer this charge. The provincial fiscal 
upon the record, which included the complaint filed by Dizon, prepared and 
presented to the court an information charging the appellants with the same 
offense. It is now insisted that the trial court did not acquire jurisdiction of 
the persons of the appellants and the subject matter of the action, because the 
information was signed by the fiscal and not by the offended party. We think 
this objection not well-founded for the reason that this criminal action or 
prosecution was instituted by the aggrieved person, Benita Dizon, when she filed 
her complaint in the court of the justice of the peace. The prosecution having 
been thus instituted whereby the courts acquired jurisdiction of both the 
persons and the subject matter of the action, the fiscal was authorized to file 
his information and make it the basis upon which the proceedings in the Court of 
First Instance might be continued to a final determination.</p>
<p>For the foregoing reasons the judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs 
against the appellants.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Carson, Moreland,</em> and<em> Araullo, JJ.,</em> 
concur.<br></p></div>
