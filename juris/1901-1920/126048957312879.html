				<BR><STRONG>MAPA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> The acts  with which the defendants are charged, and their  guilt as principals, are fully proven in  the  record. The judge below rightly classified  the acts  committed as robbery, but he held  that the case was covered by paragraph 5 of article  503 of the Penal  Code,  inflicting upon the defendants  the  penalty of eight years  of  <em>presidio  mayor</em>. The prosecuting  attorney appealed against  this decision, believing that the crime should be punished in  accordance with article 508  of  the Code, this being the only question which has been raised on this appeal.</p>
<p> The evidence shows  that  the malefactors were armed with guns and bolos; that the robbery of the clothes was committed in an  inhabited house and the robery of the carabaos in buildings  connected with inhabited  houses; that  the  value of the carabaos stolen (the value of the clothing  not having  been properly  ascertained)  exceeded 1,250  pesetas; and  finally  that  the  malefactors  entered the place where  the robbery was committed by scaling a fence which protected it and  which was of quite a considerable height.<br>
  <br>
  If any  of these circumstances had been lacking the case should have  been tried under  article 503,  paragraph 5, as the judge  held.  But the concurrence of all  these  circumstances evidently brings the case Avithin the scope of article 508, and the penalty prescribed  therein should be imposed in the maximum degree, in accordance with  the provisions of article 509.  The robbery was committed by a band, over thirty armed men taking part in it,  (Art. 505.)</p>
<p> We  therefore impose upon the defendants the penalty of  fourteen years  and eight months of  cadena temporal. The judgment below, thus modified, is otherwise affirmed, with the costs to the defendants.  So ordered.</p>
<p> <em>Arellano, C. J., Cooper, Willard,</em> and <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p>  <em>Torres, J.,</em> did not sit in  this case.</p>
