				G.R. No. 1928, March 09, 1906</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. NICOMEDES DINGLASAN ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Nicomedes Dinglasan having died pending his appeal, the cause, in so far as it relates to him, should be, and is hereby, dismissed,  with  his proportionate share of the costs in both instances <span style="font-style: italic;">de  oficio</span>.</p>
<p>Engracio de Mesa and Simeon Carandag were charged with the  crime of  brigandage,  the information  alleging that they had  conspired together and formed a  band of brigands  composed  of some twelve armed members,  and specifically charging  them with the  robbery of certain property in the municipality of San Juan de Bocboc on the 29th of June, 1903.</p>
<p>We do  not think  the evidence of record is  sufficient to sustain the charge of brigandage, but  we are of  opinion that appellants were proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the crime of robbery in an armed band as alleged in  the complaint, marked with the aggravating  circumstance that advantage was taken  of the darkness of the night in the commission of the crime.   Therefore, in accordance with the doctrine laid down in United States <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Ortega et al.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> (3 Off. Gaz., 366)  and  United States vs. Domingo  Macasadia et  al.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> (February 10, 1906, 4  Off. Gaz., 235), it is the duty of this court to reverse the judgment and sentence of the  trial  court,  and  to impose the appropriate sentence for the crime of  robbery, of which the appellants were proven guilty.</p>
<p>It appears from the record that during the trial of this case the hearing was suspended upon joint motion of the prosecution and  the defendants, and that the judge who sat in the case up to that time having left the Islands, the judge who presided  at the next term of court granted a new trial, and after hearing several witnesses who had not been called on the previous trial, pronounced judgment and imposed the sentence which is before us on appeal.</p>
<p>It does not affirmatively appear from the record whether this new trial was or was not granted on motion of the defendants,  but no objection was made at the time, and, without going into the question  as to whether, in view of the existing circumstances, such  new trial could have been granted over the objections of the defendants, their objection made for  the first  time in the brief of counsel  on appeal avails them nothing.</p>
<p>It is not  necessary to determine whether the evidence taken at the first trial should  or should  not have been taken into consideration upon the second  trial, because the evidence adduced at the second trial fully sustains the foregoing finding of the guilt of the accused of the robbery with which they are charged.</p>
<p>We therefore reverse the judgment and sentence of the trial court, and instead thereof  we sentence the said appellants Engracio de Mesa and Simeon Carandag and each of them to ten years' imprisonment (<span style="font-style: italic;">presidio mayor</span>) and the accessory penalties prescribed by law, to the restitution of the stolen property, or the indemnification of their value to the  owners thereof, and  to the payment of their respective share of the costs  in both  instances.  No provision  is made for  subsidiary punishment in this case, the principal penalty being  higher in degree than  that of <span style="font-style: italic;">presidio correccional</span>.   (Art.  51,   Penal  Code.)  So ordered.</p>
<em>Arellano, C. J, Torres, Mapa, Johnson,</em> and  <em>Willard,  JJ., </em>concur.<br>
