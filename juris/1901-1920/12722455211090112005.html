				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">An appeal by the Acting Insular&nbsp; Collector of Customs against a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Manila ordering&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; be discharged from the custody of the Acting&nbsp; Insular&nbsp; Collector of Customs and be permitted to land in the Philippine Islands.<br><br>The petitioner, Eugenio Pascual Lorenzo, in his application to the Court of First Instance for the&nbsp; writ of habeas corpus, alleges:<br><blockquote>"First.&nbsp; That he&nbsp; is illegally&nbsp; detained&nbsp; and restrained&nbsp; of his personal liberty by the Acting Collector of Customs&nbsp; of the Philippine Islands and&nbsp; is&nbsp; so&nbsp; detained&nbsp; and restrained at the custom-house of the city of Manila.<br><br>"Second. That&nbsp; he is not&nbsp; restrained&nbsp; of&nbsp; his&nbsp; liberty by virtue of&nbsp; any criminal&nbsp; prosecution&nbsp; or any order or&nbsp; sentence of any competent&nbsp; court or tribunal.<br><br>"Third. That the real motive for his detention, according to his best knowledge&nbsp; and belief,&nbsp; is&nbsp; that the said Acting Collector of Customs for the Philippine Islands claims that he was not a native subject of the Philippine Islands on the date of his last arrival per the steamer Taisang on April 7, 1908, when he was examined for admission by a board&nbsp; of special inquiry.<br><br>"Fourth. That&nbsp; he is the illegitimate child of a Fiiipina woman, by a&nbsp; Chinese&nbsp; subject, born&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Philippine Islands; that he has never taken the oath of allegiance to any foreign power and that he is still a subject of the Philippine Islands.<br><br>"Fifth.&nbsp; That he is restrained of his personal&nbsp; liberty for the purpose of deportation and refusing him&nbsp; the privilege of remaining in the Philippine Islands, his native country, and that there is&nbsp; no other&nbsp; nation&nbsp; or country that recognizes him as in any way belonging to them.<br><br>"Sixth.&nbsp; That he&nbsp; was duly landed&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Philippine Islands and&nbsp; released by&nbsp; means&nbsp; of&nbsp; a consular&nbsp; guaranty&nbsp; to appear for such investigation as the&nbsp; Collector of Customs, or&nbsp; the&nbsp; special board of inquiry,&nbsp; might require, and that upon hearings held by them full and complete proof of his status and of the facts heretofore alleged were furnished.<br><br>"Seventh.&nbsp; That he left.the Philippine Islands while&nbsp; he was a&nbsp; minor; that his mother and all&nbsp; his&nbsp; relatives&nbsp; are living in the Philippine Islands; and that he has no friends or relatives other than those in the Philippine Islands.<br><br>"Eighth, That from the decision of the special board of inquiry appeal was duly made to the Collector of Customs and denied by him.<br><br>"Ninth. That the special board of inquiry and the Collector of Customs of the Philippine&nbsp; Islands,&nbsp; as executory officer and&nbsp; Commissioner of Immigration,&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; investigation of the status of your petitioner, have acted&nbsp; in abuse of their power,&nbsp; discretion, and authority in denying that he is a&nbsp; citizen of the Philippine Islands, applying the Chinese immigration laws to him and&nbsp; demanding&nbsp; a certificate&nbsp; as&nbsp; required by section 6&nbsp; of&nbsp; Act of July 5, 1884, in order that he might land, and in making unlawful rulings and taking improper action on the case presented by your petitioner, and in exceeding their jurisdiction in attempting to make a final decision on&nbsp; a question of citizenship and the treaty of Paris.<br><br>"Wherefore your petitioner respectfully prays that a writ of habeas corpus may be granted, directing the&nbsp; same&nbsp; to the Acting Collector of Customs, H. B. McCoy, to have the body of the said Eugenio Pascual&nbsp; Lorenzo before your honor, at a time and&nbsp; place&nbsp; therein to be specified,&nbsp; to&nbsp; do and receive&nbsp; what shall then and there be considered&nbsp; by your honor concerning him,&nbsp; and that he may be&nbsp; restored to his liberty."</blockquote>The Court of&nbsp; First Instance issued a writ of habeas corpus,&nbsp; in pursuance of the prayer of said petition, and the Acting&nbsp; Insular Collector of Customs made return to said writ as&nbsp; follows:<br><blockquote>"Comes now H. B.&nbsp; McCoy, Acting Insular Collector&nbsp; of Customs, and in his official capacity makes return to the writ in the above-entitled case as follows:<br><br>"I. That the Eugenio Pascual Lorenzo referred to in the petition&nbsp; in&nbsp; this&nbsp; case arrived at the port of Manila from a foreign&nbsp; port, to wit,&nbsp; the&nbsp; port of Amoy, on the steamer Taisang on or about April&nbsp; 7, 1908, and is&nbsp; now seeking to be landed at the said port of Manila;<br><br>"II. That his right&nbsp; to land had been inquired into&nbsp; by a board of special&nbsp; inquiry thereunto&nbsp; duly&nbsp; authorized, and the&nbsp; questions put&nbsp; hy the said board were as shown in Exhibit A hereto attached; that the decision of the said board was adverse on the ground that the said Eugenio Pascual Lorenzo was not born in the Philippine Islands, and&nbsp; that, if born&nbsp; in the&nbsp; Philippine&nbsp; Islands,&nbsp; he was not a citizen having a right&nbsp; of entry at the present time,&nbsp; but was&nbsp; an alien of&nbsp; the Chinese race and descent who&nbsp; presented&nbsp; none of the statutory evidence of a right to land;<br><br>"III. That an appeal was taken on his behalf, copy&nbsp; of which is hereto annexed&nbsp; and marked&nbsp; 'Exhibit&nbsp; B;'&nbsp; that before any decision was rendered on said&nbsp; appeal, an application for rehearing was&nbsp; interposed on his behalf, which said application&nbsp; is hereto annexed and marked 'Exhibit C;' that this application was&nbsp; approved and&nbsp; the case went&nbsp; a second time before the board of special inquiry thereunto duly authorized;<br><br>"IV. That the questions put by the said board and the answers&nbsp; returned thereto on said rehearing&nbsp; were as shown in Exhibit D hereto attached.&nbsp; The decision of the board was&nbsp; adverse on the ground&nbsp; that even though he was born in the Philippine Islands yet he was not&nbsp; a&nbsp; citizen thereof and was not entitled to land, but no findings were made upon the question of fact as to the place of his&nbsp; birth;<br><br>"V. That thereafter an&nbsp; appeal was&nbsp; taken&nbsp; from&nbsp; said decision,&nbsp; copy of which is hereto annexed marked 'Exhibit E,' and the case coming on regularly for a decision&nbsp; upon the appeal, the Insular Collector&nbsp; of&nbsp; Customs rendered his decision adverse to the right&nbsp; of the applicant&nbsp; to land on the ground that the said Eugenio&nbsp; Pascual Lorenzo is an alien of the Chinese race and descent, and&nbsp; a subject of the Emperor of China, who is coming to Manila from foreign parts; that he does not present any section six certificate or other legal documentary proof of his right to land;&nbsp; that there has never been any finding by the board of special inquiry in favor of his claim to native birth; and that even though of native birth yet he is not shown to be a citizen of the Philippine Islands, nor&nbsp; to be entitled to enter the Islands at this time;<br><br>"VI.&nbsp; That thereafter still another&nbsp; rehearing was&nbsp; requested&nbsp; under date of August&nbsp; 5, 1908, copy of which said request&nbsp; is hereto annexed and&nbsp; marked&nbsp; 'Exhibit F.'&nbsp; This application&nbsp; was approved for the&nbsp; purpose of introducing only the evidence referred to in letter of July 23, 1908, which said&nbsp; letter is hereto annexed and marked 'Exhibit G;' that at&nbsp; said rehearing the proceedings were as shown in Exhibit H hereto annexed, and the decision of the board was still adverse for the reasons&nbsp; stated&nbsp; in&nbsp; the board's decision&nbsp; on the original hearing;<br><br>"VII.&nbsp; That thereafter an appeal having been interposed, copy of&nbsp; which appeal is hereto annexed and marked&nbsp; 'Exhibit 1,'&nbsp; and the case coming on regularly&nbsp; for decision on appeal, the&nbsp; Insular Collector of Customs&nbsp; again rendered his decision adverse to the right of the applicant to land, on the ground that the man is not a citizen of the Philippine Islands,&nbsp; but is an alien of the Chinese race who had no Eight of&nbsp; entry without the production of a&nbsp; section six certificate or other statutory documentary proof of such right (Exhibit J);<br><br>"VIII. That, in consequence of the adverse decision of the board of special inquiry affirmed on appeal by the Insular Collector of Customs, the said Eugenio Pascual Lorenzo has been ordered deported to the place whence he came, and the alleged detention is only such as is necessary to insure the due execution of the said order of deportation;<br><br>"IX. That the defendant denies each and every allegation in the petition contained, except as in this return specifically admitted, and especially denies that the immigration officers at the&nbsp; port of Manila, or any of them, have abused their authority, have denied the applicant any opportunity of presenting his witnesses and&nbsp; proofs,&nbsp; or have been guilty of any improper conduct in this case whatsoever;<br><br>"X.&nbsp; That the body of the said&nbsp; Eugenio&nbsp; Pascual Lorenzo is hereby produced in court to abide the order of the court in the premises.<br><br><div style="text-align: right;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"H.

He is, therefore, <i>refused landing,</i> and ordered to be deported to the place whence&nbsp; he came, as being a Chinese person and a subject of the Emperor of China, who&nbsp; does not present the certificate required by law for the admission of Chinese.&nbsp; He&nbsp; is&nbsp; informed&nbsp; of this decision&nbsp; and he&nbsp; is further informed that he has two&nbsp; days from this date within which to appeal to the Insular&nbsp; Collector of Customs in&nbsp; case he is dissatisfied with the decision of this board.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">"(Signed)&nbsp; JOHN R.

Under such&nbsp; circumstances it is a bad rule that will not work both ways.<br><br>"Article 9&nbsp; of the treaty of Paris provides for the preservation of the allegiance of&nbsp; Spanish subjects&nbsp; in&nbsp; default of which declaration they shall be held to have renounced it.<br><br>"Admitting that&nbsp; the&nbsp; immigrant was a Spanish&nbsp; subject and failed to make such declaration, then it is presumed that he did not renounce his allegiance to Spain, which places him in the same position as referred to in the Bosque case.

The argument presented in his behalf at this rehearing to some extent favors the claim of the applicant that he could not&nbsp; be a&nbsp; subject of China, and&nbsp; the Chinese law as interpreted to the board&nbsp; would seem to be to the effect that foreigners can not become subjects of China&nbsp; without obtaining an&nbsp; imperial decree, and also certain tax&nbsp; receipts and&nbsp; documents required of Chinese subjects.&nbsp;&nbsp; While there is no&nbsp; evidence before the board that this applicant&nbsp; ever obtained&nbsp; any imperial decree making&nbsp; him a&nbsp; subject&nbsp; of China or that he has the required documents, nevertheless there is no&nbsp; evidence presented that he did not obtain&nbsp; such documents although that would be the presumption.&nbsp; Granting,&nbsp; therefore, that he never obtained any imperial decree or other necessary documents to constitute him a subject of China, he would still be considered to have forfeited any right that he might have&nbsp; had to return to the Philippine Islands, in view of his long absence therefrom without any reasonable effort having been&nbsp; made to return&nbsp; at or about the time&nbsp; that he reached his majority and would&nbsp; ordinarily be supposed to be free from parental control.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is recognized that a citizen of a country has the right to leave his country and return after a temporary absence, but inasmuch as this man is clearly a person of Chinese descent and does not come within the terms of the treaty of Paris and the subsequent Acts of Congress defining citizens of the Philippine Islands, this board is constrained to believe that he comes&nbsp; within&nbsp; the prohibitions of the Chinese-exclusion laws, and is not entitled to enter the Philippine Islands at this&nbsp; time.<br><br>"He is informed of this decision through his attorney, Mr. O'Brien, and verbal notice was given to the board&nbsp; that an appeal would be taken from this decision within the time prescribed.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">" (Signed)&nbsp;&nbsp; JOHN B.

In fact,&nbsp; it&nbsp; appears clearly&nbsp; from the record that he&nbsp; left the Islands&nbsp; ten years before the date mentioned, and continuously resided&nbsp; in China;&nbsp; in fact that he had reached his majority previous to the date mentioned, and now for the first time claims his rights as a citizen of the Philippine Islands.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; admitted that&nbsp; he is a person&nbsp; of Chinese race and descent,&nbsp; and even though&nbsp; born in the Philippine Islands under the section of law above&nbsp; quoted&nbsp; he can not now be considered a citizen,&nbsp; and consequently his right to admission here must necessarily be governed&nbsp; by the requirements .of&nbsp; the Chinese-exclusion law, and in order to be admitted at this&nbsp; time he must&nbsp; present the certificate required&nbsp; by section 6 of the Act of&nbsp; Congress of July 5, 1884.<br><br>"The appeal&nbsp; in&nbsp; this case is, therefore, necessarily overruled.<br><br><div style="text-align: right;">"(Signed)&nbsp; GEO.&nbsp; R.&nbsp; COLTON,<br><i> "Insular Collector of Customs."</i></div></blockquote>The return by the Acting Insular Collector of Customs sets out at length&nbsp; what appears to be all that took place in the hearing before the board of special inquiry.&nbsp; These facts are neither traversed nor denied by&nbsp; the&nbsp; applicant.

right&nbsp; (the applicant's) to&nbsp; land has&nbsp; been inquired into by the board of special inquiry, thereunto duly authorized; that the decision of said board was adverse on the ground that the said&nbsp; Eugenio Pascual Lorenzo was not born in&nbsp; the Philippine&nbsp; Islands, and that if born&nbsp; in the Philippine Islands he was not a citizen having the right of entry at the present time, but was an alien of Chinese race and descent,&nbsp; who presented none of the&nbsp; statutory evidence of right to land."</blockquote>Said sections of the Act of Congress&nbsp; above referred&nbsp; to are as follows:<br><blockquote>"SECTION 10. That the decision of the board of special inquiry, hereinafter provided for, based upon the certificate of the examining medical officer, shall be final as to the rejection of aliens affected with tuberculosis or with a loathsome or dangerous&nbsp; contagious disease, or with any mental or&nbsp; physical disability, which&nbsp; would bring such aliens&nbsp; within any of the classes excluded from admission to the United States under section 2 of this Act."<br></blockquote>Section 25 provides in part as follows:<br><blockquote>"SECTION 25. That such boards of special inquiry shall be appointed&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; at the various ports .of arrival as may be necessary for the prompt determination of all cases of immigrants detained at such ports under the provisions of&nbsp; law.&nbsp; Each board&nbsp; shall&nbsp; consist&nbsp; of&nbsp; three members. *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; Such boards&nbsp; shall have authority to determine whether an alien who has been duly held shall be allowed to land or shall be deported.&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; <i>Provided, </i>That in every case where an alien is excluded from admission into the United States, under any law or&nbsp; treaty now existing or hereafter made, the decision of the appropriate immigration officers, if adverse to the admission&nbsp; of such alien, shall be final, unless reversed on appeal to the Secretary&nbsp; of Commerce and Labor (in the Philippine Islands to the Collector of Customs); but nothing in this section shall be construed to admit of any appeal&nbsp; in the case of an&nbsp; alien rejected as provided for in section 10 of this Act."</blockquote>The above sections were also&nbsp; found in earlier Acts of Congress.&nbsp; For some years eminent&nbsp; lawyers questioned the constitutionality of said provisions&nbsp; upon the ground that Congress had no power to confer upon boards of special inquiry authority to finally decide questions relating to the right of persons to enter&nbsp; territory1&nbsp; of the&nbsp; United States. The Supreme Court of the United States has time and time again upheld the legality of such statutes.&nbsp;&nbsp; (U. S. <i>vs.</i> Sing Tuck,&nbsp; 194 U. S., 161;&nbsp; V.&nbsp; S. <i> vs.</i> Ju Toy, 198 U.&nbsp; S., 253; Murray <i>vs.</i> Hoboken Co., 18&nbsp; Howard, 272, 280; Springer <i>vs.</i> U.S., 102 U.

Williams, 192 U. S.,&nbsp; 1; U. S. <i>vs.</i> Arredondo,&nbsp; 6&nbsp; Peters,&nbsp; 691, 729; Quinby <i>vs.</i> Conlan, 104 U. S., 420, 425; U.

(7 Off. Gaz., 427, 13 Phil. Rep., 34);&nbsp; (Shoemaker <i>vs. </i> U. S., 147 U. S., 282; Braun <i>vs. </i>Metropolitan West Side, etc.,&nbsp; Railroad&nbsp; Co., 166 111., 434.)<br><br>In the latter case the supreme court of Illinois said&nbsp; (p. 436):<br><blockquote>"We have&nbsp; carefully&nbsp; considered the evidence relied upon by the appellant as&nbsp; showing that this verdict&nbsp; is so inconsistent with the weight of&nbsp; the testimony as that the court below should&nbsp; have set it aside, and this court, for its failure to do so,&nbsp; should reverse the judgment.&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been often decided by this court that&nbsp; in cases of this kind, where the jury have viewed the premises and the&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; is conflicting, we will not&nbsp; interfere with the verdict unless it is so manifestly contrary&nbsp; to the preponderance of the evidence as to indicate misconduct.&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; (See also City of&nbsp; St. Louis <i>vs</i>. Brown, 155 Mo., 545.) "<br><br>"Under the Chinese-exclusion and&nbsp; the immigration laws, where a person of Chinese descent asks admission to the United States,&nbsp; claiming that he is&nbsp; a native-born citizen thereof, and&nbsp; the lawfully designated officers find that&nbsp; he is not, and upon appeal that finding is&nbsp; approved&nbsp; by the Secretary&nbsp; of&nbsp; Commerce and Labor (Collector of Customs) and it does not appear that there is any abuse of discretion, such finding1 and action of the executive officers shall be treated by the courts as having been made by a competent tribunal, with due process of law, and as final and conclusive; and in habeas corpus proceedings, commenced there- after, and based solely on the ground&nbsp; of the&nbsp; applicant's alleged citizenship, the court should dismiss&nbsp; the writ&nbsp; and not&nbsp; direct&nbsp; new and further evidence as&nbsp; to the question of citizenship."&nbsp;&nbsp; (U. S. <i>vs.</i> Ju Toy, 198 U. S., 253.)</blockquote>The Supreme Court of the&nbsp; United States has decided in many cases that&nbsp; a Chinese person can not prevail in a habeas corpus proceeding by showing simply that the decision of the inspector or board of special inquiry was wrong.&nbsp; If a&nbsp; fair, full hearing was given and full opportunity&nbsp; had to present evidence&nbsp; and a question of fact was presented&nbsp; and decided and the&nbsp; action taken was&nbsp; not arbitrary, then the decision of the inspector, affirmed&nbsp; by the department, <i>is final</i>&nbsp; (Chin Low <i>vs</i>. U. S., 208 U. S., 8, 11 (1907); U. S. <i>vs</i>. Ju Toy, 198 U. S., 253; <i>Ex parte</i> Ling Foot, 174 Fed. Rep., 70 (Nov. 22, 1909).)<br><br>This doctrine has also been repeatedly stated and relied upon by this court.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Ngo-Ti <i>vs</i>. Shuster, 7 Phil.&nbsp; Rep., 365; Ko Poco <i>vs. </i>McCoy, 10 Phil. Rep., 442;&nbsp; Luzuriaga <i>vs.</i> Insular Collector, 10 Phil.&nbsp; Rep., 762.)<br><br>In the case of&nbsp; Ngo-Ti this court decided that&nbsp; "The decision&nbsp; of administrative officers&nbsp; that a person&nbsp; seeking to enter the Islands is not a citizen <i>is final</i> when no abuse of authority by such officers is alleged."<br><br>This rule applies&nbsp; when a&nbsp; person&nbsp; seeking&nbsp; to enter&nbsp; the territory of the United States alleges that he is a citizen and&nbsp; is denied admission, as well as when he&nbsp; is&nbsp; prohibited from entering for any other reason.&nbsp;&nbsp; (U. S. <i>vs. </i>Sing Tuck, 194&nbsp; U. S., 161.)&nbsp; The rule is&nbsp; well settled that a Chinaman seeking admission into the United States because of alleged birth therein must in the first instance submit his claim to the determination of the immigration officers.&nbsp; Such officers have a right to decide upon all questions of fact, includfng that of citizenship.<br><br>The mere fact that the applicant alleged that he was a citizen of the United States or territory thereof, and the fact that the administrative officers found that he was not a citizen, is not sufficient in itself to show that such administrative officers abused their&nbsp; authority.&nbsp; Practically&nbsp; all of the cases which&nbsp; come&nbsp; before the immigration&nbsp; officers, brought&nbsp; by&nbsp; persons seeking admission&nbsp; into the&nbsp; United States, involve the question of citizenship.&nbsp; The mere fact that the&nbsp; applicant alleges that he is a citizen of the United States, and the fact that the proper department of the Government has decided that he is not, provided such applicant was given a fair, full hearing and had full opportunity to present evidence, and a question of fact was presented and decided,&nbsp; and the action taken&nbsp; was&nbsp; not&nbsp; arbitrary,&nbsp; is&nbsp; not sufficient to&nbsp; justify the&nbsp; granting&nbsp; of the writ&nbsp; of habeas corpus, when such person&nbsp; is denied the right&nbsp; of admission. A mere finding of facts, after a full and fair hearing, and opportunity given to present evidence, and all the evidence which the applicant&nbsp; has, that the applicant is not a citizen and therefore not entitled to enter the United States is not an abuse of&nbsp; authority, provided&nbsp; that such finding was based upon such evidence.<br><br>The lower court in his decision said:<br><blockquote>"The petitioner, having been&nbsp; born in the Philippine Islands and being a citizen, does not&nbsp; cease to be such citizen at law until such time as he&nbsp; has taken steps to renounce his allegiance as such citizen."<br></blockquote>This assumption&nbsp; of law is not in conformity with&nbsp; the actual decisions.&nbsp; No&nbsp; actual or express&nbsp; renouncement&nbsp; of citizenship is necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mere absence from one's country for a prolonged period, without the intention&nbsp; of returning, may be sufficient.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the present&nbsp; case the applicant left the Philippine Islands when he was about 15&nbsp; years of age and remained in China until he was 34 years of age.&nbsp; He says himself that he had no intention of returning to the Philippine Islands until&nbsp; the year&nbsp; before he did&nbsp; return. His mother and his brother say that he married a wife in China.&nbsp; This fact he denies.&nbsp; The applicant says that he owned and operated a farm in China; that he was a subject of the Chinese Empire.&nbsp; If,&nbsp; as the lower court found, he was a citizen of the Philippine Islands, notwithstanding the fact that he had resided in China for a period of nineteen years, he would be entitled to a passport from the Government of the Philippine Islands and he would be entitled to travel in foreign countries under the protection of the United States Government; and if he is really a&nbsp; citizen, he is&nbsp; entitled to the protection of the&nbsp; United States Government, even&nbsp; though he still continues to reside in&nbsp; the Empire&nbsp; of China.&nbsp; The applicant testified that he never had any intention of returning to the&nbsp; Philippine Islands until&nbsp; last&nbsp; year.&nbsp; It must have been upon this testimony that the Collector of Customs found that, if the applicant had ever been a citizen of the Philippine Islands,&nbsp; he&nbsp; had lost such citizenship by his long residence in the Chinese Empire.<br><br>Secretary Olney&nbsp; (a member of President Cleveland's cabinet) in passing upon the right&nbsp; of a person born within the United States, but who had for a number of years resided&nbsp; in Germany, to retain his citizenship in the&nbsp; United States, said:<br><blockquote>"Otherwise,&nbsp; following&nbsp; the&nbsp; precedent established&nbsp; for&nbsp; a number of years,&nbsp; this department would&nbsp; be constrained to regard Josef Georg Surmann&nbsp; as having&nbsp; voluntarily relinquished his right to continued protection as&nbsp; a citizen of the United States&nbsp; by reason of his prolonged and indefinite residence abroad after attaining his majority."<br></blockquote>In the case of Surmann, he was born in the United States and only resided in Germany&nbsp; two years after attaining his majority.&nbsp; In the present case the applicant continued to reside&nbsp; abroad for at least eleven years after he had reached his majority without in any way indicating (even admitting that he had been&nbsp; a citizen of the&nbsp; United States)&nbsp; that he intended to retain such citizenship.&nbsp; The rule adopted by the State Department of&nbsp; the United States Government with reference to&nbsp; the&nbsp; time&nbsp; within which&nbsp; a citizen of the United States, by&nbsp; residing abroad, may lose such citizenship is that a continued residence for three years abroad, after the attainment of majority, unless it is clearly proven that the animo <i>revertendi</i> had existed, is sufficient to lose citizenship.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Van&nbsp; Dyne on&nbsp; Citizenship,&nbsp; pp. 276,&nbsp; 277;&nbsp; <i>In re</i> Bosque,&nbsp; 1&nbsp; Phil.&nbsp; Rep., 88.) In the present case the Collector of Customs found that, if the applicant had ever been a citizen of the Philippine Islands, he had lost such citizenship by reason of his long residence in China.&nbsp; This conclusion of fact, in our opinion, is&nbsp; supported&nbsp; by the facts found&nbsp; in the&nbsp; return&nbsp; above quoted&nbsp; made&nbsp; by the Collector of Customs.&nbsp; No&nbsp; allegation is made that the applicant did not have a fair and full opportunity to present&nbsp; all&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; proof which he had. There is, therefore, no foundation upon which this&nbsp; court can&nbsp; base its&nbsp; conclusion that the Collector of Customs,&nbsp; in reaching the&nbsp; conclusion which he did, in any way abused the authority which was conferred upon him.<br><br>The judgment of the&nbsp; lower court,&nbsp; therefore,&nbsp; is hereby reversed, and the applicant is hereby remanded to the custody of the proper officials to be disposed of in accordance with the order of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Collector&nbsp; of Customs.&nbsp; It is so ordered, with costs.<br><br><i>Torres, Carson,</i> and&nbsp; <i>Moreland, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><i>Arellano, C.
