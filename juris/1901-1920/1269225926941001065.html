				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This defendant is the same person who was the defendant in the case of U. S.<em> vs.</em> Poh Chi.&nbsp; (See&nbsp; case No.&nbsp; 6636.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> ) In that case (No. 6636) the&nbsp; defendant was charged with the illegal possession of opium in violation&nbsp; of the provisions of section&nbsp; 31,&nbsp; of Act&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 1761, as&nbsp; amended by section 3 of Act No. 1910.<p>In this case (No. 6637) the&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; is charged with the violation of section 7 of Act No.&nbsp; 1761.&nbsp; The complaint in each case (Nos.&nbsp; 6636 and&nbsp; 6637)&nbsp; was filed in the lower court on the same day.&nbsp; The evidence adduced in both of these cases in&nbsp; the&nbsp; lower&nbsp; court was&nbsp; practically&nbsp; the&nbsp; same. The evidence shows that one&nbsp; Merrill, a lieutenant of Constabulary,&nbsp; went to&nbsp; the house of the defendant, and after making a search found under the floor a small amount of opium&nbsp; and a pipe used in smoking opium.&nbsp; The opium and the pipe were&nbsp; found together under the floor; they were found in the same place, at the same time,&nbsp; and&nbsp; by the same person.&nbsp; As was said above&nbsp; the defendant was charged and convicted&nbsp; in case No. 6636 with the illegal possession of opium.&nbsp; In this case, No. 6637, he is charged with the illegal possession of a pipe which is used in smoking opium. The lower court,&nbsp; after hearing the evidence in this&nbsp; case, found the defendant guilty and sentenced him to pay&nbsp; a fine of P400, and in case of insolvency to suffer subsidiary imprisonment and to pay the&nbsp; costs.&nbsp; From that sentence the defendant appealed to this&nbsp; court.</p><p>The question presented here is, "Is&nbsp; the defendant guilty of two distinct crimes under the facts as above stated?"</p><p>This court,&nbsp; in&nbsp; the case of U. S. <em>vs</em>. Canuto Gustilo (19 Phil,&nbsp; Rep., 208), speaking through Mr. Justice&nbsp; Moreland, said:</p><blockquote><p>"We are confident that that portion of the Philippine Bill embodying the principle that no person shall be twice put in jeopardy of punishment&nbsp; for the same offense&nbsp; should, in accordance with its&nbsp; letter and spirit,&nbsp; be made to cover as nearly as possible every result which flows from a single criminal&nbsp; act impelled&nbsp; by&nbsp; a single criminal&nbsp; intent.&nbsp; The fact should not be lost&nbsp; sight of that it is the injury to the public which the criminal action seeks to redress, and by such redress to&nbsp; prevent its repetition, and not the injury to individuals.&nbsp; In so far as a single criminal act, impelled by&nbsp; a single criminal intent, in other words, one violation, is divided into separate crimes and punished accordingly, just so far is the spirit of the&nbsp; Philippine Bill and the provisions of article 89 of the Penal Code violated.&nbsp; </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"In our judgment the possession&nbsp; of two&nbsp; firearms under the conceded facts of this case&nbsp; constitutes but one criminal act, one&nbsp; violation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Having&nbsp; been punished once&nbsp; for&nbsp; that act, he can not, under the provisions of the Philippine Bill and article 89 of the Penal Code, be punished again for the same&nbsp; act."</p></blockquote><p>The conclusion in the said Gustilo case is supported by many authorities, therein&nbsp; cited.</p><p>It is true that&nbsp; the Commission&nbsp; has provided a&nbsp; certain punishment for the possession&nbsp; of a pipe used in the smoking of opium, for the smoking of opium, as well as a punishment&nbsp; for the illegal possession of opium,&nbsp; but it&nbsp; is not believed that it was the intention of the legislature to have separate complaints filed against a person who was found in the&nbsp; illegal possession of&nbsp; opium and a pipe at the same time.&nbsp;&nbsp; If that were true then every person who was found to be smoking opium could be&nbsp; charged in three&nbsp; different complaints: <i>First</i>, with the illegal possession of the pipe; <i>second</i>, the illegal possession of the opium; and <i>third</i>, for smoking the&nbsp; opium.&nbsp;&nbsp; Certainly&nbsp; the legislature did not intend any such consequences.</p><p>For the reason stated in the said Gustilo case, the judgment of the lower court is hereby reversed, the defendant is discharged from the custody of&nbsp; the law and the complaint is hereby ordered to be dismissed.</p><p><em>Torres, Mapa, Carson,</em> and <em>Moreland, JJ.</em>, concur.<br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br></p><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="left"><p></p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; September 1,&nbsp; 1911; not published.</div>
