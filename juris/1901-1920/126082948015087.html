				G.R. No. 3807, October 08, 1907</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND. APPELLEE, VS. SANTIAGO CABIGAO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The accused, Santiago Cabigao, was sentenced by the Court of First  Instance of the city  of Manila to imprisonment  (<em>presidio mayor</em>) for six years and one day, and to pay the  costs, for having  inflicted  a wound 2 inches long  on Eduardo Trinidad, which penetrated the eighth rib,  affecting the lung,  the pleural cavity through  the diaphragm,   and  the spleen.   From this judgment  the defendant has appealed.</p>
<p>The appeal having been heard, the liability of  the accused appears as having been properly considered,  but not so the nature of the crime for which he is answerable.   The case at bar has been classified as frustrated homicide; but as recommended by the Attorney-General in  this instance, in accordance  with the judgment in cassation dated October 4, 1886,  "whenever a specified act, such as that of <em>lesiones</em>, is defined and punished separately, it is not legally proper to  attribute a  greater intent on the part of the offender when  the crime was committed, in  order to classify it as a more serious offense, except Avhen very marked circumstances  reveal in a clear and evident manner that the intent was really greater."</p>
<p>This case being  included  in paragraph 3 of article 416 of the Penal Code,  without any aggravating or extenuating circumstance,  the  accused  should be sentenced  to suffer in its medium degree the penalty of <em>prision correccional</em> in its minimum and  medium degrees.</p>
<p>Therefore, Santiago Cabigao is hereby sentenced to two years of <em>prision correccional</em> with the corresponding accessories, to indemnify Eduardo Trinidad in the  sum of P250, and in case of insolvency  to suffer subsidiary imprisonment, and to pay the costs in both instances; one-half of the detention already endured to be credited in his favor. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Johnson, Willard, </em>and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
