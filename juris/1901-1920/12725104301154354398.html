				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On November 29,&nbsp; 1912, Vicente Rodriguez filed an&nbsp; application in the Court of Land Registration for the adjudication of title and the registration in his name of 248 hectares 71 ares and 6 centares of land situated in the municipality of Sariaya, Province&nbsp; of Tayabas.&nbsp; The application was opposed by the Director of&nbsp; Lands and&nbsp; a number of homesteaders&nbsp; who claim that&nbsp; the land is a&nbsp; part of&nbsp; the public lands and is&nbsp; in their possession under&nbsp; homestead grants issued to them in accordance with law.<br><br>The lower court denied the application&nbsp; for registration upon the ground that the evidence is too uncertain ad to the area and boundaries of the land to which the applicant holds title to justify the registration of the land described in his application.<br><br>The applicant&nbsp; offered in support of his claim of title eleven documents; eight of these documents are composition titles, as follows:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Exhibit C.</span>—A composition title issued&nbsp; on May 8, 1895, by the Spanish Government in favor of Da.

Trinidad Alcala y Rodriguez for 19 hectares 32 ares and 98 centares of land in the barrio of Mangalang, pueblo of Sariaya, Province of Tayabas. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Exhibit I.</span>—A&nbsp; composition title issued&nbsp; on May 8, 1895, in favor of Da. Teresa Alcala y Rodriguez for&nbsp; 19 hectares 32 ares and 98 centares of land in the barrio of Mangalang, pueblo of Sariaya, Province of Tayabas.<br><br>The applicant&nbsp; testified that the land embraced in the above composition titles, with the exception of parcel No. 1, Exhibit F, is the land for which he is seeking a registered title.<br><br>In addition to the Composition titles the following documents were&nbsp; submitted in&nbsp; support&nbsp; of applicant's&nbsp; claim&nbsp; of title:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Exhibit J.</span>—A public document executed on September 5, 1913, by Cayetana Alcala, the mother of Vicente Rodriguez, which purports&nbsp; to be an intervivos gift in favor of Vicente Rodriguez of the&nbsp; land embraced in the&nbsp; composition title issued in favor of Da. Cayetana Alcala&nbsp; on May 8, 1895. (Exhibit C.)<br><br>It will observed that this document is dated nearly a year subsequent to the&nbsp; filing&nbsp; of&nbsp; the application herein.&nbsp; The application was&nbsp; filed in the Court of Land Registration on November 29, 1912.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Exhibit K.</span>—A deed of&nbsp; sale dated February&nbsp; 10, 1912,&nbsp; of the&nbsp; land embraced&nbsp; in Exhibit H,&nbsp; executed by&nbsp; Trinidad Alcala in favor of Vicente Rodriguez.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Exhibit L</span>.—A deed of sale dated January 23, 1912, executed by Teresa Alcala in favor of&nbsp; Vicente&nbsp; Rodriguez for the land embraced in Exhibit I.<br><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Exhibit LL.</span>—A deed of sale executed by Lorenzo Luna, Hilario Luna, and Hilarion Valderas in&nbsp; favor of Vicente Rodriguez for the land embraced in&nbsp; Exhibit G.&nbsp; This deed is dated February 10, 1912.<br><br>It will be observed&nbsp; that the composition&nbsp; title evidenced by Exhibit G was issued in favor of Hermogena&nbsp; Alcala y Rodriguez.&nbsp; The record does&nbsp; not show how the title to this land passed to Lorenzo Luna, Hilario Luna, and&nbsp; Hilarion Valderas.&nbsp; It may be that&nbsp; these parties had come into the ownership of the land by inheritance, but what&nbsp; the real fact was is not satisfactorily disclosed by&nbsp; the record.<br><br>It may be&nbsp; well to note, in passing, that counsel for the appellant have fallen&nbsp; into serious&nbsp; error&nbsp; in&nbsp; making their computation of the total area of the tracts of land&nbsp; referred to in these documents.&nbsp; In addition to the areas&nbsp; given in the seven composition grants—Exhibits C to I—-they include also, as separate tracts, the land embraced in the documents J, K, L, and LL, thus estimating the total area shown by the exhibits at 234 hectares 92 ares and 74 centares.&nbsp; It is very clear, however, that the documents J, K, L, and LL refer to the land embraced in the Exhibits C, H,&nbsp; I, and G, and that counsel, in estimating the total area of the land described in the exhibits,&nbsp; counted these parcels twice.<br><br>The area of the various tracts mentioned in the composition grants (Exhibits C to I), excluding the small parcel in Exhibit F which Rodriguez says is not included in the application, is as follows:<br><br><blockquote> <table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td width="46%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="21%"><div align="center">Hectares </div></td> <td width="20%"><div align="center">Ares. </div></td> <td width="13%"><div align="center">Centares</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="center"></div></td> <td><div align="center"></div></td> <td><div align="center"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Exhibit C </td> <td><div align="center">19</div></td> <td><div align="center">32</div></td> <td><div align="center">98</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Exhibit D </td> <td><div align="center">19</div></td> <td><div align="center">32</div></td> <td><div align="center">98</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Exhibit E </td> <td><div align="center">19</div></td> <td><div align="center">32</div></td> <td><div align="center">98</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Exhibit F (3 parcels): </td> <td><div align="center"></div></td> <td><div align="center"></div></td> <td><div align="center"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>No. 1</td> <td><div align="center"><sup>(a)</sup></div></td> <td><div align="center"><sup>(a)</sup></div></td> <td><div align="center"><sup>(a)</sup></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>No. 2 </td> <td><div align="center">19</div></td> <td><div align="center">32</div></td> <td><div align="center">98</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>No. 3 </td> <td><div align="center">19</div></td> <td><div align="center">32</div></td> <td><div align="center">98</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Exhibit G </td> <td><div align="center">19</div></td> <td><div align="center">32</div></td> <td><div align="center">98</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Exhibit H </td> <td><div align="center">19</div></td> <td><div align="center">32</div></td> <td><div align="center">98</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Exhibit I </td> <td><div align="center">19</div></td> <td><div align="center">32</div></td> <td><div align="center">98</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="center">_____</div></td> <td><div align="center">_____</div></td> <td><div align="center">____-</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Total</td> <td><div align="center">154</div></td> <td><div align="center">63</div></td> <td><div align="center">84</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br><div style="text-align: center;">a Omitted.<br></div><br>The area of the land&nbsp; claimed by the applicant is 248 hectares 71 ares and 6 centares.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a difference of 94 hectares 7 ares and 22 centares&nbsp; between the area claimed and that shown by his title document. The record shows that practically all of the 248 hectares claimed by the petitioner is now held by parties who have gone into possession under homestead grants issued by the Government.&nbsp; The applications for those homestead grants were filed in 1910,1911, and 1912.&nbsp; Most of them were filed in the year 1911.&nbsp; One application&nbsp; was&nbsp; filed in&nbsp; August, 1912, only a few months before the filing of the petition for registration by Rodriguez.<br><br>From an examination of the descriptions of the property as given in the composition grants, together with that found in the plot Exhibit A made under the direction of the Bureau of Lands, there can be little doubt that the land embraced in the composition&nbsp; grants is the identical tract which the Director of Lands is claiming as a part of the public domain, or a part of it.&nbsp; Referring to the composition grants, we find that the estero <span style="font-style: italic;">Mangalang </span>is given as the western boundary of the tracts&nbsp; described&nbsp; in Exhibits G, H, and I and also as the western boundary of parcel No. 2 in Exhibit F.&nbsp; This is&nbsp; the only natural boundary given in the&nbsp; various descriptions found in the record.&nbsp;&nbsp; A reference to the plot (Exhibit A) shows that the estero <span style="font-style: italic;">Mangalang </span>is the western boundary of the&nbsp; tract in question&nbsp; for a considerable distance.&nbsp; The irresistible conclusion is that the land embraced in these composition grants embraces, in part at least, the land for&nbsp; which the Government has issued preliminary homestead patents.&nbsp; This being the&nbsp; case, there can be&nbsp; little doubt that these&nbsp; grants were&nbsp; illegal to the extent of the land embraced in the composition grants from the Spanish Government.<br><br>From all the evidence, we think it can fairly be deduced that the various members of the&nbsp; Rodriguez&nbsp; family joined in securing&nbsp; composition title to a tract of land which they or their predecessors in&nbsp; interest claimed to have reduced to cultivation;&nbsp; that they arbitrarily divided the original parcel into lots of&nbsp; equal size, estimated to contain 19 hectares 32 ares and 98 centares each,&nbsp; the&nbsp; different&nbsp; members of the family taking one or more lots;&nbsp; that the applicant&nbsp; has acquired some if not&nbsp; all of these lots; that&nbsp; the total&nbsp; area of the lots which applicant claims to have acquired&nbsp; as shown on the face&nbsp; of the composition grants amounts to 154 hectares 63 ares and 84&nbsp; centares; that the land now claimed by&nbsp; him includes&nbsp; an area of 248&nbsp; hectares 71 ares and&nbsp; 6 centares;&nbsp; that&nbsp; some,&nbsp; if not all,&nbsp; of the land held&nbsp; by the opponent homesteaders is included within the land embraced within the composition grants; that unless it be&nbsp; held that the total area of the land granted in the various composition titles amounted to&nbsp; 248&nbsp; hectares 71 ares and&nbsp; 6&nbsp; centares, although the total area granted in terms was but 154 hectares 63 ares and 84 centares, it is impossible from the record, as&nbsp; it now stands, to ascertain the precise location of the land embraced within the composition grants.<br><br>It may be that the original tract cultivated&nbsp; by the family of the applicant actually contained 248 hectares and that the various lots for which composition titles were taken contained more&nbsp; than the amount mentioned&nbsp; therein.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the applicant failed to submit the necessary evidence&nbsp; upon which to base such a finding.<br><br>It may be, on the other hand, that the original tract contained but 154 hectares, and that the applicant is entitled to but that amount of the land described in his application. In that event, however, his evidence as to the precise location of the land embraced within his application is not sufficient to sustain a decree fixing.definitely the location of the land embraced Within the composition titles.<br><br>It should be observed, also, that while it is probable that the applicant has acquired perfect title to all the land included in the composition titles submitted by him, the formal proof of transfer of title from the original grantees as it appears in the record is highly defective.<br><br>We are satisfied, however, that the applicant, upon being advised of the nature of the defects in the&nbsp; evidence can, if given an opportunity, readily cure these defects, at least to the extent of establishing in himself a&nbsp; registerable title in 154 hectares 63 ares and 84 centares of the land included within the land described in his application, and perhaps to the entire tract.<br><br>Under these circumstances, we think his application for a new trial should not have been denied, and that he should have been given an opportunity to introduce new and additional testimony, to cure the defects in the evidence of title upon which he rested his application, so far as it lies in his power so to do, after having been advised of the nature of the defects,in that evidence as proof&nbsp; of title to the land claimed by him.<br><br>It is the policy of the law to encourage and assist owners of real estate in procuring the registry of their property. The cost and labor involved in the institution&nbsp; and maintenance of land registration proceedings from the filing of the application to the entry of judgment is always considerable and ofttimes extremely burdensome.&nbsp;&nbsp; It would seem, therefore, that only under exceptional circumstances should an application&nbsp; for registry in the Court of Land Registration be dismissed over the objection of the applicant, and with out giving him an opportunity by the grant of a new trial or&nbsp; otherwise&nbsp; (upon the payment of the costs up to the date of the grant of a new trial or upon such terms as the court may&nbsp; deem&nbsp; reasonable&nbsp; and just),&nbsp; to submit additional evidence in support&nbsp; of his claim of title, when there are strong or reasonable grounds to believe that he is the owner of all&nbsp; or any part of the land described in his application.&nbsp; This especially when the only ground for the dismissal of the application is the lack of formal or perhaps even substantial proof as to the chain&nbsp; of title upon which applicant relies, or as to the precise location of the&nbsp; land, which there is reasonable ground to believe can be supplied by the applicant upon his being advised as to the nature of the&nbsp; defects or omissions in the evidence offered by him, such defects or omissions having been the result&nbsp; of oversight or excusable error on his part in submitting his evidence in support of his claim of title to the land described in his application.<br><br>In the case at bar we&nbsp; are of opinion that the interests of the applicant, the Government, and the homesteaders will be consulted and conserved by the grant of a new trial, in the course of which the appellant will be permitted to submit such additional evidence&nbsp; as to his&nbsp; title to the land in dispute, and the location of the land embraced in the composition titles filed with his application,&nbsp; as he may see fit.<br><br>The&nbsp; judgment entered&nbsp; in the&nbsp; court below should be reversed and the&nbsp; record remanded to the court wherein these proceedings originated for a new trial, without special condemnation of costs in this&nbsp; instance, the costs of the proceedings in the&nbsp; court below up to this point to be paid by the applicant.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Trent,</i> and <i>Araullo JJ.,</i> concur.<br></div>
