				<H3>INCHAUSTI & COMPANY, PETITIONERS AND APPELLEES, VS. THE COMMANDING GENERAL OF THE DIVISION OF THE PHILIPPINES, REPRESENTING THE UNITED STATES, RESPONDENT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is an appeal by the  commanding general of the Division  of the Philippines.  It  appears that on the 2d of December, 1903,  Inchausti &amp; Company petitioned the Court of  Land  Registration for the inscription of certain land  "situate  on  Calle Rosario,  in the city of  Iloilo; bounded on the north by the lands of Agustin Monasterio, there  being between  these properties the  alley called 'Oppen;' on the east by Calle Rosario; on the south and west by the seashore,' and having an area of 6,861 square meters and 98 square centimeters; and there  being erected on the same a  warehouse of  strong material, with walls of stone construction and roof and <em>medias aguas</em> of galvanized iron; and having an assessed value of 13,723.96 dollars for the land and of 12,500 dollars  for the warehouse, in money of the United States.   Notices were published and citations were made in particular to the municipal council of Iloilo,  the chief quartermaster  of Iloilo, the commanding general of  the Division of the Philippines, and to the Attorney-General of the Philippine Islands, none of whom presented opposition except the  aforesaid  commanding general of the Division of the Philippines.  The personality of his opposition was attacked by the petitioner in a motion in which, among other things, it was alleged that the commanding general of the Division of the Philippines was not the representative of the United States in the Philippines, which motion was overruled by the court, an exception being taken by  the petitioner,  the court admitting the opposition, to which ruling another exception was taken by the petitioner.</p>
<p>It also appears that the grounds of the opposition were:</p>
<ol>
  <li> That the President of the United States, on the 10th of October, 1903, reserved for military  purposes  the lands situated in the vicinity of the <em>cotta</em> of Iloilo, which is now known by the name of "Fort San Pedro No. 22."<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> That the law  enacted  by Congress on the 1st day of July, 1902, separated from the authority of the Philippine Commission  those public lands  reserved by the President of the United States for military purposes, and  therefore laws Nos. 627, 809, and 496 of the aforesaid Commission had no effect in so far as they granted title to land situated within the military zone of which the petitioner was  not the absolute owner on the 1st of October, 1903.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> That the title of Inchausti &amp; Company was defective, inasmuch as the grant made to Juan Reyna by  the governor of the Visayas in 1870 referred to land which is within the first military zone belonging to the before-mentioned <em>cotta</em> and that the land was not uncultivated land mentioned in the royal  decree Of the 25th of June, 1880, or  in any prior law, and  therefore Juan Reyna could not transmit to his successors a better title than his own, which was defective.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> That when the property of the nation is  destined for public  uses, it acquires the status of  public property and is outside of the commerce of men, not being the  object of prescription; that prescription  can not run  against  the State as an owner in  its public or private capacity, and that such property destined to the use of the  Government is not subject to  prescription.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> That the laws in force at the time of the inception of the possessory proceedings in favor of Inchausti &amp; Company on the '20th of November, 1890, granted no good title against the Government without its acquiescence; and in conclusion, that the first grant being defective, the land being public and property of the  State, Inchausti &amp; Company could not acquire, nor could any other person, title by prescription,  the  contestant asking that the title  of  Inchausti &amp; Company be declared  null and that the title of the land be vested in the  United States.</li>
</ol>
<p>It  also appears, and was so stipulated, that the land for which inscription is asked, and which is the object of these proceedings, has been  occupied and was occupied (the  stipulation is dated the 25th of February, 1904)  by the Army of the United States by virtue of a lease executed by the  petitioners as owners  of this property, renewing annually the contract which was entered into on  the 30th of November, 1900, and which was to expire on the 30th of  June,  1904, and that this was admitted between the parties  without prejudice to  the opposition presented  by the representative  of the United States  on the one hand, and without prejudice to the objection to this personality to make opposition by such representative on the  other.</p>
<p>And it appears that only a question of law having thus been raised, the Court of Land Registration decided it  by decreeing the adjudication and registration of the land and buildings in question in favor of Inchausti &amp;  Company, without costs, which decision was appealed by the commanding general of the Division  of  the  Philippines.</p>
<p>Entering now into an examination of the debated question in this appeal, we find that the title of the property which the petitioners claim is based upon perfect contracts transferring ownership, such acts  and contracts being  essentially civil in character transmissive of ownership and other real inherent rights, with the exception of the first contract, which was essentially administrative, but also a transfer of the ownership  and  other  real rights to a specific property.</p>
<p>On the 20th of August, 1883, Tirso Lizarraga acquired from  Francisca  Garcia, its former  owner, for  Inchausti &amp; Company, by virtue of a contract of sale, the land in question, executing a notarial instrument to this effect, and on the 14th of March, 1885,  Francisco Garcia acknowledged having received from Inchausti &amp; Company the purchase price of the same, executing a notarial receipt for this amount.  Francisco Garcia had acquired this land in conjunction with Victor Gomez, from its prior owner, Juan Reyna, also by means of a contract of purchase, on the 10th of February, 1881, having executed a notarial instrument, and subsequently, on the 13th of September of the same year, the said Francisco Garcia acquired the share  of his coowner, Gomez, becoming the sole owner of the land according to a notarial deed.   Juan Reyna had acquired the land by administrative concession in the manner and form set out in the proceedings instituted to that effect.</p>
<p>On the 29th of December,  1870,  the political-military governor of the Visayas issued the following decree:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Upon consideration of  this  petition,  in  which the Spaniard, Juan Delgado Reyna, asks for the land  called '<span style="font-style: italic;">Quema</span>' at the end and on the right hand side of the street which leads to the <em>cotta</em> from this capital in order to erect thereon  his ironworks and  foundry,  with  due  regard to the damage which might be caused to the town by  establishing  this factory  in  its center,  and this Government desiring  to avoid a fire which might reduce to ashes the neighboring houses,  and equally, on the other hand,  to protect in every way possible a factory of such well-known utility to the province, this Government gives to the  Spaniard, Juan Reyna, the land asked for in order that he may transfer  the aforesaid works thereto, with the understanding that  if  at any time in the  opinion of the Government it be  necessary to use this before-mentioned land, he will be indemnified with other land suitable for his iron works and foundry.  Let a copy of this, petition  and decree  be filed in the archives of this Government and let this document be delivered to the above-mentioned Sr.  Reyna  in order that he may as soon as possible make a plan of this land and remit it to this Government for its approval.— Rojas."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the 4th of February, 1873, to a new petition of Reyna, the political-military governor of the Visayas required the report of the chief engineer of public works of that district, which he gave in the following terms:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"In my Opinion," he said, "there is no objection to the granting of  the title  to the  property to  Reyna without that condition subsequent of the former decree in order that the manufactory  may  be enlarged and developed as required by  the growth of  this town, because at present there is no necessity to use this land for the erection of any public buildings,  nor do I  see, considering  its situation, that it will prove to be needful in the future for that purpose, therefore this office does not find the least objection to  your giving the petitioner that  which  he asks without other restriction than the absolute prohibition to construct any warehouse or building,  and much less his  dwelling house, of  light  or inflammable  material thereon, since their proximity to the site designated for the public jail and to the houses of the barrio would place these in constant danger."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And on the 11th of February,  1873, the following decree was issued:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"In view of all that appears  in these proceedings, and in conformance with the opinion of the chief engineer of the Visayas, this government does definitely grant to Juan Reyna the land in  the place  called '<span style="font-style: italic;">Quema</span>'  occupied  by his ironworks and  iron  foundry, according to the sketch accompanying this  decree, and  it may be utilized in the manner best suited to  his interests, subject, however,  to the conditions set forth in  the  report of the before-mentioned engineer, on which, report this grant is based.  Let the <em>gobernadorcillo</em> of Iloilo and the <em>principalia</em> be notified so they may give formal possession of the above-mentioned land to the said Reyna under the conditions governing the concession, and this done, a record of all the proceedings had in connection therewith shall be kept at the tribunal and the original papers shall be delivered to the said Reyna for his own use.—Fajardo."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the 15th of the  same month and  year, Reyna was given possession of  the land by the municipality of Iloilo, the <em>gobernadorcillo</em> and <em>principales</em> signing the record of the proceedings.</p>
<p>Thus it was in 1881, as said before, that Reyna sold to Garcia and Gomez this land at the end of Calle Rosario, bounded by this street, by the house and lot of Jose Concolluela, and by the seashore, on which was then erected a warehouse, ironworks, and foundry provided with machinery, tools, and other appliances, and thus it was that in 1883 Garcia, after having acquired the share belonging to Gomez, sold all he had acquired from Reyna to Tirso Lizarraga, receiving the balance of the purchase price from Inchausti &amp; Company, to whom he executed a receipt.</p>
<p>On the 15th of November, 1890, this property  was recorded in the Registry of Property the same as the adjoining property (concerning which there is no question as to the validity of the title) by virtue of an order of the judge of the Court of First Instance of Iloilo made in the possessory information proceedings which were had before  him by Inchausti &amp; Company, and  since then this property appears in the  public register in the name of Inchausti &amp; Company, according to the certificate bearing the date of the 25th of November, 1890, presented in the trial of the case.</p>
<p>All of these facts are admitted ,and undisputed.</p>
<p>It is also an admitted and undisputed fact that on the 13th of August, 1898, and upon the change of sovereignty by the treaty of Paris, Inchausti &amp; Company possessed the land as owners, and from them the military authorities of the Army of the United States, in November, 1900, received a lease to this property and remained in possession thereof as lessees for more than three years up to June, 1904.</p>
<p>So that the cession by Spain to the United States of all the lands of  the public domain could not have included this  land, the  treaty of Paris containing the following provision:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"And it is hereby declared that the relinquishment or cession, as the case may be  (cession in the case of  the Philippines), to which the preceding paragraph  refers <em>can not in my respect</em> impair the property or <em>rights</em> which by law belong to the <em>peaceful possession of property of  all kinds</em>, of provinces, municipalities, public or private establishments, ecclesiastical or civic bodies, or any other  associations having legal capacity to  acquire  and  possess property in the aforesaid territories renounced or ceded, or  of <em>private individuals</em>, of whatsoever nationality such individuals may be."   (Art. VIII, sec. 2.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Inchausti  &amp; Company were  in <em>peaceful possession</em> of this land, a fact which was well known to the  contestant in the case who received the land from the said Inchausti &amp; Company, and as lessee had  been  for more than three years in the peaceful possession thereof.   The actual possession by Inchausti &amp; Company dated from 1883 and the possession derived from its former owner began in 1870, making  thirty-three years of peaceful  adverse  possession against the world, including the Government, as owner by virtue of acquisition for a valuable consideration by means of a civil contract essentially transferable of the  ownership and other real rights protected  by the civil laws.</p>
<p>The rights  of the peaceful  possessor, according to the law, are, among others:  (1) That he "has a right to  be respected in his possession, and  should he be  disturbed therein he must be protected or possession must be restored to him by the means provided in the laws of procedure;" (2) that "the peaceful possessor under claim of title has in his  favor the legal presumption that he holds possession by  reason of  a sufficient title  and he  can not  be forced to show it."   (Civil Code, arts. 446 and 448.)</p>
<p>Inchausti &amp; Company, therefore, had in their favor a well-defined legal status, even though no more  than that of  a peaceful  <em>possessor</em>,  and it must be respected and presumed to exist and they should  be protected in the possession of that which is presumed to be theirs.</p>
<p>The  Philippine bill enacted by Congress July 1, 1902, says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"That all the property and rights which may  have been acquired in the Philippine Islands by  the United States under  the treaty of peace with  Spain,  signed  December tenth, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, except  such land or other property as shall be designated by the  President of the United States for military and other reservations of the  Government of the United States, are hereby placed under the control of the Government of said Islands, to be administered for the benefit of the inhabitants thereof, except as provided in this act."  (Sec. 12.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This section does no more than to place under the control and administration of the Insular Government all the property and rights ceded by Spain to the United States— all that they <em>could</em> have acquired from Spain by the treaty of peace—with the exception of what may be set aside for military or other reservation.  If, according to article 8 of the treaty of peace,  only the public property of Spain could have been acquired by the United  States, and such public property did not include that belonging to private individuals, then the title and rights of a peaceful possessor under the law could not be affected or impaired by this cession and the land of Inchausti &amp; Company, which was not  public but private land on the date of  the  treaty, would not come under  the control of the Insular Government, nor could it be set aside as a military reservation.</p>
<p>This fact, <em>a priori</em> considering the legal status of affairs at the time the cession took place,  does not preclude an action upon a just cause to claim the recovery and reversion to the State  of property then considered private in order that it might  be declared public  and  continue  to  the State.   And  in this sense we are disposed to consider the present opposition, but not without the  following conclusion : The legal status of the land in question on the 10th of December, 1898, the date of the treaty of peace, was that of private property and not that of public property ceded by Spain to the United States, inasmuch as the land was peacefully possessed by Inchausti &amp; Company, who continued in possession until the 23d of  February, 1904, when this  opposition was made.</p>
<p>The basis of this opposition was no other than the claim that this land was public property within the meaning of article 339 of the Civil  Code, it  lying in  the first military zone, adjoining the  "<em>cotta</em> of Iloilo," now known as "Fort San  Pedro No. 22."  (Facts 3,  6, and 8 of the answer.) It is expressly alleged  by the  opposition that it  is not arable (<em>baldio</em>) land within the meaning of the royal decree of the 25th of June, 1880, nor of any prior law.  (Fact 3.)</p>
<p>This being the only ground of the opposition, it can not be  entertained because it is based upon a false assumption, to wit: That any  land  lying within a military zone is public land and should be considered, under the provisions of article 339 of the Civil Code,  as are  the walls, fortresses, and  other defenses.  The  military  zone provided for in  article  10,  title  2, part 6 of  the military ordinances  of the Spanish army, which extends over a radius of 1,500 yards from the fortifications, does not mean that the land included within that  space belongs  to the State.  It simply creates a legal  easement  in that the owners of  the  land  therein embraced  could  not  build without the necessary permit and without certain restrictions.  The opposition, therefore,  is  groundless.   It  is upon the supposition that this was a polemic  zone, and that all the land included within the 1,500 yards covered by  said zone was public property, that it is claimed by the opposition that the land in question was public land.  It has already been said that the oppositor expressly denied that the land in question was arable land—that is to say, that the land was public because it was arable.</p>
<p>But the court in disallowing the opposition based its decision upon the ground that the land was  public land because it was arable, adding that it was granted by the political-military governor of the Visayas, who was not a competent authority to  make such grant, the  proper proceedings not being had.  Notwithstanding this finding that the land in question was public  land because it was arable, the court in its decision granted authority to have the said land registered in the name of Inchausti  &amp; Company upon the theory  that  the land had become  private property because the  transfer made by Juan Reyna on the 10th of February, 1881, to Francisco Garcia and Victor Gomez, and by  the  latter to  the representatives of Inchausti  &amp; Company  on the 20th of August, 1883,  was undoubtedly considered by the court as a just and sufficient title to convey the ownership of  the land under laws 9 and 18, title 29, partida 3, and article 1952 of the  Civil  Code, according to which,  whether the period of possession  is counted from the 10th of February, 1881, or from the 20th of August, 1883, not only the ten years required by law 13, title 29, partida 3, and article  1957 but more than twenty years had elapsed, there is no doubt, according to the court below, that title by ordinary prescription may have  been acquired by the petitioners.  It was thus attempted to establish  the doctrine that arable land in the Philippine Islands, as  all  other property therein, may be acquired  by ordinary prescription of ten years provided there is a just title, such as the contracts of sale in question, and good faith on the part of the  possessor, such good faith being presumed to exist until the contrary is proven.</p>
<p>If the land in question was really public land in the sense of the decision of the court below, it would be necessary to reconsider the doctrine laid down by this court in a case in which the majority said: "We are of the opinion that from 1860 to 1892 there was no law in force in the Philippines under which the petitioner could have acquired title (to his land) by prescription without the intervention of the Government"   (Valenton <em>vs</em>.  Murciano.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>)  But  it not being such public land, as will be shown later, there is no  occasion for this court to reconsider this question as to which the majority has laid down that doctrine.</p>
<p>The contestant in his brief, disputing the theory as to the prescriptibility of arable lands in the Philippines laid down in the decision  of the court below, seems to have changed his views  so as to conform with those of that court by asserting that the land was in fact arable land (in his answer the contestant expressly denied that the land was arable land within the meaning of the royal decree of the 25th of June, 1880, or of any prior law), because he says in conclusion that "the petitioner as  well as his grantors lost whatever right they had to perfect his title on account of the failure  to comply with the provisions of the royal decree of the  <em>25th of June, 1880</em>, and subsequent decrees up to and including that of the 13th of February, 1894," which is equivalent to saying that  he had not petitioned the Spanish Government for a patent as required by the legal provisions first cited, or that he had not instituted  the  possessory information proceedings which,  in  accordance with the last-mentioned decree of 1894, had come to substitute the adjustment (<em>composicion</em>) proceedings, all of which proceedings, according to the provisions of an administrative  character above  cited,v related to arable lands.  For this reason the contestant asks that the judgment of the court below be reversed and that "the said land be declared to be public land, the property of the United States, in accordance with sections 5 and 7 of Act No. 627.of the Philippine Commission" (p. 10).</p>
<p>It would be very difficult to explain why the  land in question should be considered as arable  land when there is nothing in the record which would warrant such conclusion.  Neither in the petition, nor in the description of the land, nor in the documents presented by either party, nor in the whole discussion of the case, is there an argument or indication that would suggest that this case related to arable land; on the contrary, it very plainly  appears from the record that the case refers to land which could not be properly  called arable land; a land as to which the chief of the bureau of public  works of the district of the Visayas, in a matter within his absolute jurisdiction,  said, "there is no necessity to use this land for the erection of any <em>public buildings</em>,"  neither then nor  in the future; a land for the concession of which the  first thing required was that no structures of light or inflammable material be built thereon  in order  that the danger of fire might be avoided; a land in "proximity to the site designated for the public jail and to houses of the barrio" abutting upon a certain  street and adjoining a house and lot  of  another resident of the place and upon which there were buildings to the value of 25,000 dollars or more, and which had been expressly granted for the  purpose of placing thereon  a dangerous but useful  enterprise such as would ordinarily have been erected outside of the town, We fail  to see how such land can be termed arable land.</p>
<p>The last law on the subject in force in the  Philippine Islands at the advent of the new sovereignty was the royal decree of the 13th of February, 1894, which embodied all prior legislation in regard to public land with a new and precise tendency to protect private property and to insure the  territorial credit,  the main  object  of the mortgage law.  It will be important to read the following from the preamble:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Since the incorporation  of the  Philippine Islands in the Crown of Castile, constant and special attention has been given to  the development  of private ownership in those most fertile territories;  and although there is a large extent of land under <em>cultivation</em> this is not as yet in proportion to the population.  *   *   *  Although there will not be omitted the necessary forest reserves which, if placed under cultivation would be prejudicial to the public welfare, by directing that the necessary classification and survey  of  these , forests  be made.   *  *  *  Attention  is given to the common property of towns.   * * *  To the welfare and prosperity of the <em>agricultural</em> municipalities this measure will be  beneficial,   *   *   *  insuring in future to the natives, wherever it may be possible, the necessary land for cultivation in accordance with the traditional usages of the country and the use of the products of the forest for  the common  benefit of the  inhabitants.   Great. facility is  given for legalizing present holdings and the acquisition of lands by those who  actually and under a claim of title have been cultivating them, while  on the other hand an opportunity is given to take advantage of the provisions of the mortgage law and the proper registration of new private properties."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is sufficient to fix our attention  on this last paragraph in order to know to  what class of land or property the provisions  of the royal decree of the 25th of June, 1880, et seq,, in regard to the acquisition of public land and the provisions  of the royal decree of the 13th of February, 1894, in regard to the possessory information proceedings which were substituted for  the adjustment  (<em>composicion</em>) proceedings, relate.   All  of them  refer to  alienable public lands which are arable.  Article 19 of this last-mentioned royal decree, which provides for the possessory information as  one of the  means  of legalizing such  possession, is very clear.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Those in possession of alienable public lands <em>under cultivation</em> (and no others) who have neither obtained nor applied for a patent from the  Government  at the time of the publication  of this decree  in the "Gaceta de Manila" may  secure  such  patent free  of charge by means  of  a possessory information, in accordance with the law of civil procedure and the mortgage law, provided they prove any of the  following circumstances, to wit: First, that  they have  or have had such land  <em>under cultvation</em> uninterruptedly  for a period of six years prior thereto; second, that they have  been in possession uninterruptedly for  a period of twelve years and that the land was <em>under cultivation</em> at the time the possessory information proceedings were instituted and during the  three years immediately preceding; third,  that they have been  in  the open and uninterrupted possession of the  land  for thirty  years or more, although the land may not be <em>under cultivation</em>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course  the petitioners could not have availed themselves of these  means of legalizing their rights, assuming that  their possession was illegal, for the  simple  reason that the land in question was not arable land as  to which they  could have proven, even  if they wanted to, any of the above three circumstances.   The alienable arable land prior to the 17th of April, 1894, when the royal decree of the 13th of February of the same year was published in the Manila Gazette, and  which could be acquired by adjustment (<em>composicion</em>) with the Government, as well as subsequent thereto, by means of a possessory information, were only the rural arable lands beyond the <em>legua comunal</em> and the forestry zone,  the rural land and not the urban which already was a part of an organized town.</p>
<p>A famous legal writer, and a person of great experience on the  subject,  in treating in one of his works on  "the methods prescribed for the transformation of simple occupation into the rights of ownership," says: "In the third place, the various provisions enacted  for the purpose of issuing to the holders  of land  the corresponding titles of ownership by means of the procedure known to the old legislation of the Indies as adjustment proceedings.  But these provisions did not produce the results that the Government expected, undoubtedly on account of their limited and casuistic nature."  Further on he says: "Because, as a matter of fact, the only means of providing a firm basis to rural ownership, such  as would offer  to  agricultural industries sufficient guaranties, stability, and progress, was to make it easy for those willfully or unconsciously in the wrongful possession of lands to bring themselves within the terms of the law.   It  was so understood  by the Government when the important regulations  for the adjustment of public lands, approved  by the royal decree of the 25th of June, 1880, which contain the basis of the constitution of private territorial  ownership  in the far eastern Spanish possessions, the provisions of which have generally continued in force, were issued."  (This  was written in 1892.  Oliver, 1, "Derecho Inmobiliario  Espafiol," 818 and 819.)</p>
<p>In the preamble to the Reformed Mortgage Law of Cuba, Porto Rico, and the Philippines, the minister who counter-signed the royal decree of  the 26th of May, 1893, and the proposed act which provided for such reform, said: "Our mortgage law, which  had numerous  precedents in  the Archipelago, will be improved  with very  slight changes which, together <em>with the reform </em>of the provisions relating to the <em>adjustment of public lands</em>, will facilitate the establishment of territorial banks, the principal basis of which is a good mortgage law and legally registered titles defining and protecting rights to real estate."</p>
<p>The Land Registration Court in saying in  its decision that the politico-military governor of the Visayas was not a competent authority to grant this land to Juan Reyna in ,1870, and that the necessary proceedings were not had, means to say that no proceedings were  had in regard to the disposition and adjustment of an arable piece of land and that the governor  in question, who, by the way, was not merely the governor of the  Province of Iloilo but of all the Visayan Islands, was not the competent authority to institute any proceedings in  regard to  the disposition and adjustment of arable land.   The court proceeds upon the assumption that the land granted to Reyna was arable land, thus begging the very question in dispute, because the very thing that should be proven is what the court did assume and there is not the slightest evidence in the record on this point.</p>
<p>The  original  proceedings instituted by  two  politico-military governors of the Visayas in regard to the grant of the land to Reyna,  subject at first to a condition subsequent,  and finally unconditionally,  form a part of  the record.  This is certainly not a proceeding for the disposition or adjustment of an arable tract of land.  These proceedings related to the  disposition or grant of land which could at that time have belonged either to the municipality or the province  (its exact nature does not appear).  The report of the chief of public works in regard to this land sets out that the only question looked into was whether at that time  or in future there would  be any necessity of <em>using  the land for public buildings</em>.   This was  undoubtedly,  so far as the record shows, the only  use to which the land could be devoted, and such was the use to which it was to be put as set out in the proceedings.   Land destined for building  purposes is <em>prima  facie</em> urban  property; a building lot differs from farm land. </p>
<p>According to the  description of  the land given in  the petition and the nature of the property, it can not be said that the property in question is rural property.  It is clearly urban property as shown by  the notarial instruments executed relating to contracts  concerning the land in question.  In order to consider such land as arable land, it would be necessary that some proof or evidence be introduced to this effect, but as a matter of fact no proof of any kind was presented.</p>
<p>Whether the  politico-military governors who had to do with the grant of the land exceeded their powers, both executive and administrative, with reference to the laws then in force, is not a question here in dispute  and this court can not make any finding upon this point.</p>
<p>The only points decided by this court are: (1)  That it does not appear that the land in question was within any military zone which in accordance with the Spanish military ordinances requires such a zone of defense; (2) that, even assuming that the land in  question was within some polemic zone, publicly known as such, it could not for this reason be included in the class of lands devoted to general or special public use, thus considering the same as  public or State land; (3) that, even assuming that the land in question was embraced within some polemic or military zone, it still remained private property, subject, however, to the legal easement created by the establishment  of the polemic zone, which phrase, under the Spanish law, merely means an easement and not  ownership; (4)  that there is nothing in the record which would warrant a finding to the effect that the land in question was "public arable land" as it has been termed, unless there is a general presumption to this effect, something which we do not admit, because it is not provided for by any law, legal  principle, doctrine, or authority; (5) that all the laws concerning the necessity of applying  for adjustment  of lands in accordance with the rules <em>ad hoc</em> approved by the royal decree of the 25th of June, 1880, which adjustment was subsequently substituted by the possessory information proceedings in order to furnish the necessary patent to those in possession who had none—a quitclaim title on the part of  the Government being understood by such patent, according to the opinion of a majority of this court—relates  to uncultivated land; that is  to say, <em>arable land</em> such as farm land, and not urban land  such as the land here in question, which was granted by the politico-military  governors of the Visayas expressly for building purposes.</p>
<p>Aside from the titles of ownership  derived from the original one under which Juan Reyna entered into possession of the  land there was  recorded in the Registry of Property as such on the 15th of November, 1890, a possessory information.</p>
<p>What force  such  possessory  information would  have had, the land in question  being, as assured, arable land prior to the  enactment of Act No. 809 by the Philippine Commission, would be  a question open to  debate;  but since the passage of the  said act on  the  27th of July, 1903, there seems to be no doubt that, in accordance with section 1 thereof, which is an amplification of the provisions of section  19  of  Act No.  496, the said possessory information  has the same efficacy that all other titles enumerated in this act have. </p>
<p>Section 19 of  Act No. 496, as amended, is in part as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Application for registration of title may be made by the following persons, namely:</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
  <p>"Third. The person or persons claiming, singly or  collectively, to  own or hold any land under a possessory information  title, acquired under the provisions of  the Mortgage Law of the Philippine Islands and the general regulations  for the  execution of same."  (Act No.  809, sec.  1 ,(c).)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the reasons above set  forth the judgment of  the court below is affirmed and after the expiration of twenty days let judgment be entered accordingly,  and ten days thereafter the record be remanded to  the Court of Land Registration  for execution thereof.  So ordered.</p>

<em>DISSENTING</em></div>
<p><strong>CARSON, J.:</strong></p>
<p>I dissent..</p>
<p>This case is brought here under the provisions of section 14 of the Land Registration Act, the parties  having agreed that there is  no dispute as to  the facts.  Under these  circumstances, this court is bound by the findings of the lower court.</p>
<p>The trial court was of opinion that the lands in question were public  agricultural lands before  being reduced to possession by  the  applicant's predecessors  in  interest.</p>
<p>This court rests its decision on a finding that the lands in question were  not public agricultural lands but urban lands, and on this finding, which  is in direct conflict with the finding of the trial  court,  sustains the judgment.</p>
<p>In the case of Mateo Cariño <em>vs</em>. The Insular Government<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> (4 Off. Gaz., 751), since the majority opinion in this case was filed, this court reasserts the doctrine that prescription does not run against the Government and declares that the doctrine of presumptive grant can not apply to the Philippines in view of Spanish legislation for the  Indies.  It would appear; therefore, that the judgment of the trial court, which is based on the prescriptive title of the applicant, should not be maintained on the facts as submitted to us for consideration.</p>
<p>Other grounds for dissent are discussed at length in my dissenting opinion in the case of  Clara Alfonso <em>vs</em>. The Commanding General of  the Division of the Philippines,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> No. 1935, and it is unnecessary to repeat them here.</p>
The judgment of the trial court  should be reversed.<br>
