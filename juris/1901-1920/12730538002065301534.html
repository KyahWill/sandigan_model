				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The appellant was&nbsp; convicted in the Court of First Instance of Manila of a violation of section 3 of Act No.&nbsp; 1761 (Opium Law), upon the following information:<br><blockquote>"The undersigned accused Tin Masa of having violated the provisions of the Opium Law, as follows:<br><br>"That on or&nbsp; about&nbsp; the 26th day of February,&nbsp; 1910,&nbsp; in the city of Manila, Philippine Islands, the said Tin Masa voluntarily, illegally, and criminally had&nbsp; in&nbsp; his possession some twenty grams of opium and a pipe for smoking opium, without having been duly authorized&nbsp; to possess the same. All contrary to law."</blockquote>The trial court sentenced the defendant to pay a fine&nbsp; of P310&nbsp; and&nbsp; to pay the&nbsp; costs&nbsp; of&nbsp; the proceedings,&nbsp; or, in&nbsp; case of insolvency to&nbsp; suffer the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment as provided by law.<br><br>The accused&nbsp; when&nbsp; arrested was&nbsp; sitting on&nbsp; a bed&nbsp; in a room&nbsp; in a&nbsp; house in Calle Nueva, Binondo, Manila, talking to another Chinaman,&nbsp; who was standing there.&nbsp; The room was full of opium smoke, and upon being searched a small box of opium was found behind a clothes'&nbsp; chest close to the wall, and an opium pipe was found hidden in a hole which had been dug out in a&nbsp; post of the bed on which the accused was sitting.&nbsp; There was only one bed&nbsp; in the room.&nbsp; When the internal-revenue agents who made the arrest&nbsp; asked who had been smoking opium, each of the Chinamen pointed to the other. In the room was found also the clothes and registration certificates of the&nbsp; defendant, together with certain articles&nbsp; of feminine apparel.&nbsp;&nbsp; The defendant testified that he did not live by himself in the room;&nbsp; that the bed was not his; and&nbsp; that he knew nothing of the pipe&nbsp; or opium which was found there; but he admitted that he lived&nbsp; in the room, and&nbsp; that&nbsp; he rented&nbsp; other rooms&nbsp; in the house&nbsp; to various tenants.<br><br>The&nbsp; only error assigned on&nbsp; this appeal which need be considered was the alleged failure of proof that the defendant knew that he had&nbsp; on his premises the opium and opium pipe which were found there by the internal-revenue agents.&nbsp; Section 31&nbsp; of Act No. 1761 is as follows:<br><blockquote>"Any unauthorized&nbsp; person owning,&nbsp; carrying,&nbsp; holding, having, controlling,&nbsp; having&nbsp; possession of,&nbsp; or knowingly having on his premises, any opium, cocaine, alpha or beta eucaine, or any derivative or&nbsp; preparation of such&nbsp; drugs or substances,&nbsp; on and after March first, nineteen&nbsp; hundred and eight, shall be&nbsp; punished by a fine not exceeding ten thousand pesos, or by imprisonment for not exceeding five years, or by both such fine and imprisonment, in the discretion of the court: <i>Provided, however,</i> That in the case of the commission of a second offense under the provisions of this section, any person&nbsp; so&nbsp; convicted, if&nbsp; other than&nbsp; a citizen&nbsp; of the United States or a citizen of the Philippine Islands, may, by order of the court,&nbsp; be deported."</blockquote>It is true, as counsel for appellant insists, that a conviction can&nbsp; not be had under this section unless it affirmatively appears that defendant <i>knowingly</i> had the prohibited articles on his&nbsp; premises,&nbsp; or that the <span style="font-style: italic;">animus possidendi</span> in fact existed together with his alleged&nbsp; apparent possession or control of such&nbsp; articles,&nbsp; But direct proof of facts of this nature in a criminal proceeding; is&nbsp; rarely forthcoming, except in cases of confession, and their existence may and usually must be inferred from&nbsp; the varying&nbsp; circumstances in each particular case. In the case at bar we are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the circumstances under which the prohibited&nbsp; articles were found justify the inference that they were in the defendant's&nbsp; room&nbsp; with his knowledge, and that they were in his possession and control at the time of his arrest.<br><br>In&nbsp; the&nbsp; case&nbsp; of The United States&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Tan Tayco&nbsp; (12 Phil.&nbsp; Rep., 739),&nbsp; we acquitted&nbsp; the defendants who were charged with&nbsp; unlawfully having an&nbsp; opium&nbsp; pipe&nbsp; in&nbsp; their possession and control on the ground that the <i>animus possidendi</i> did&nbsp; not appear, although the evidence introduced by the prosecution in that case was of a very similar character to the evidence of the prosecution in&nbsp; this case.&nbsp; But it is to be observed that in the former case one of the defendants introduced testimony which furnished "a full,&nbsp; satisfactory, and sufficient explanation&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; presence of&nbsp; the utensils for smoking opium in his house at the time of their seizure, which is&nbsp; entirely consistent&nbsp; with the allegations&nbsp; of the defendants that those utensils&nbsp; were not&nbsp; at that&nbsp; time in their possession, and therefore, entirely consistent with the innocence&nbsp; of the defendants."&nbsp; In the case at bar no explanation&nbsp; was&nbsp; offered of the&nbsp; fact that the opium&nbsp; and the opium pipe were found in the bedroom of the defendant, which would even tend to&nbsp; put in&nbsp; doubt the reasonable&nbsp; inference therefrom, that under all the circumstances these articles were in the possession&nbsp; and control of the defendant, knowingly on his premises, and that as to these articles the <i>animus possidendi</i>&nbsp; did&nbsp; in&nbsp; fact exist at the time of his arrest. <br><br>The judgment&nbsp; of&nbsp; conviction and the sentence imposed upon the appellant should&nbsp; be affirmed, with&nbsp; the costs&nbsp; of this instance against the appellant.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres,&nbsp; Mapa,&nbsp; Johnson, Moreland,</i> and <i>Trent, JJ.</i>, concur.<br></div>
