				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. JUAN RIVERA AND RAFAELA VITUG, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This case was brought up on appeal filed by counsel for the defendants from 
the judgment dated October 27, 1913, whereby the Honorable Julio Llorente, 
judge, found them guilty of concubinage with scandal and sentenced Juan Rivera 
to the penalty of one year eight months and twenty-one days of <em>prision 
correccional</em> and Rafaela Vitug to two years four months and one day of 
<em>destierro</em>, forbidding her to come within a radius of twenty-five 
kilometers of the municipality of Lubao, Pampanga. Both were sentenced to the 
accessories of the law, with allowance of credit for half the time of their 
detention, and to payment of the costs in equal parts.
<p>It was fully shown at the trial that the defendant Juan Rivera legally 
married Anselma Garcia on June 3, 1893, in the town of Lubao, Pampanga, and 
during the first years of their marriage they had various children, of whom only 
Gregorio Rivera has survived; that said spouses continued to live together until 
1902 when Rivera separated from his wife and went to live in marital relations 
with Rafaela Vitug, who was likewise separated from her husband Carlos Punsalan; 
that since the said year 1902 the defendant Rivera and Vitug have been living 
together as man and wife in different places and especially in the town of 
Lubao, Pampanga; that since that time they have been seen to go about always 
together in public, in the church, and even in the streets of this city of 
Manila, for on one occasion when the injured wife met them in one of the streets 
of Manila, Juan Rivera told her that he was seeking pretexts for separating from 
his concubine; that both in the houses the defendant Rivera had in the barrio of 
Pulita of the town of Florida blanca and in the barrio of San Vicente of Lubao, 
as well as in the house of the parents of the defendant Vitug in the barrio of 
San Francisco and in that of the grandfather of the defendant Rivera himself in 
the barrio of San Nicolas of the said town of Lubao, they were seen to retire 
together and to pass the nights lying in each other's embrace in the same 
bed.</p>
<p>The facts set forth really constitute the crime of concubinage with scandal, 
provided for and punished in article 437 of the Penal Code, for the defendant 
Juan Rivera, lawful husband of the complainant Anselma Garcia, separated from 
her and has been living from 1902 up to the date of the complaint, January 24, 
1913, with Rafaela Vitug, also married, and they have been going about the 
streets of the town wherein they resided and performing overt acts of 
concubinage in sight of everybody, without any reserve or consideration of the 
offense to law and morality, their conduct producing a bad example among their 
neighbors and other acquaintances; wherefore it is beyond doubt that they have 
violated the penal law.</p>
<p>The defendants pleaded not guilty, and Rafaela Vitug, the only one who 
testified in the case, denied that she had lived in marital relations with her 
codefendant Juan Rivera.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the facts stated, it appears from the trial that since 1902, 
when Juan Rivera ceased to live with his wife Anselma Garcia, until 1912, when 
the latter filed a complaint that her husband was living in concubinage with 
another woman, with whom he lias been living within and without the conjugal 
home for a period of more than ten years, the complainant has remained silent in 
spite of the fact that she frequently saw her husband in company with his 
concubine in the same town in which she lived.</p>
<p>On June 13, 1912, the offended woman filed a complaint in the justice of the 
peace court of Lubao, charging her husband Juan Rivera and Rafaela Vitug with 
adultery, because they had entered into marital relations with great scandal (p. 
47); but by another document dated the 17th of the same month and year, the 
complainant Anselma Garcia set forth that in filing the foregoing complaint she 
had confided in the disinterested advice of certain persons, but as she could 
not rely upon the evidence to sustain it and having no interest in prosecuting 
it further, she desisted and withdrew it and asked for final dismissal of the 
case, which was ordered by the justice of the peace (p. 53). The next day, June 
18, the separated spouses executed in the presence of two witnesses the document 
at page 44, ratified before a notary public, wherein they both appear to have 
declared among other things that because of incompatibility of habits and 
because they were unable to live together as husband and wife, by common 
agreement they had been separated since the year 1902, after which date it had 
been agreed that their only child Gregorio Rivera should continue to live with 
and be under the care of its mother Anselma Garcia, but that at any time their 
said child should desire and wish to live with its father for the sake of its 
education, its mother would not oppose this; and moreover they solemnly declared 
that each one renounced any claim for damages against the other, in case they 
might have such either at that time or in the future accruing to either by 
reason of their marriage, and therefore they renounced any right that they might 
have in their favor from that time thenceforward.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, under date of January 24,1913, the injured woman again filed 
her complaint, charging her husband Rivera and his concubine Rafaela Vitug with 
the crime of concubinage with public scandal.</p>
<p>Article 437 of the Penal Code says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The husband who shall keep a concubine in his home, or out of it with 
scandal, shall be punished with the penalty of <em>prision correccional</em> in 
its minimum and medium degrees.</p>
<p>"The concubine shall be punished with banishment.</p>
<p>"The provisions of articles 434 and 435 are applicable to the case referred 
to in this article."</p></blockquote>
<p>Article 434 of the same code says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"No penalty shall be imposed for the crime of adultery except upon the 
complaint of the aggrieved spouse.</p>
<p>"The aggrieved spouse can only file such a complaint against both offenders, 
if both are living, and not at all if he or she has consented to the adultery or 
pardoned either of them."</p></blockquote>
<p>If the provisions of the second paragraph of this article 434 are applicable 
to the case of a husband accused of concubinage with scandal, according to the 
provisions of the last paragraph of the above-quoted article 437 of the code, 
then when it has once been shown in this case that the complainant Anselma 
Garcia gave her consent to the concubinage of her husband with Rafaela Vitug, 
without having appealed to the authorities to denounce the act for more than ten 
years after they began to live together in the same town in which she resided, 
it is evident that she can institute no criminal action against her husband and 
his concubine, by reason of her consent, as prescribed in the above-quoted 
article 434 of the Penal Code.</p>
<p>The long period of time of over ten years that elapsed during which her 
husband Juan Rivera was separated from her after 1902 and living in marital 
relations with Rafaela Vitug, without its having occurred to her to denounce 
such unlawful conduct, although they all lived in the town of Lubao, where the 
immoral life her husband was leading with the defendant Vitug was public and 
notorious, is proof of her consent thereto, and if only in June, 1912, it 
occurred to her to accuse him of adultery, although a few days later she 
desisted from her complaint and on the next day by common accord they executed 
the agreement of separation set forth in the document at page 44, ratified 
before a notary, the injured party has by such conduct demonstrated in an 
indubitable manner that if before 1912 she had given her consent to the illegal 
conduct of her husband, later she ratified it in a document setting forth that 
she withdrew the complaint she had presented and in the agreement of separation 
of which mention has been made.</p>
<p>It has been alleged by the defense that the injured woman filed the complaint 
against her husband in 1912 by inducement of persons opposed to him in the 
election for the office of municipal president of Lubao, for which her husband 
Rivera was a candidate; and that the later complaint filed in January of 1913 by 
like inducement was due to the fact that he had been elected president. </p>
<p>The theory to be deduced from these allegations is not impossible or 
unlikely, because the silence Anselma Garcia kept during ten years and her later 
attitude from the time when her erring husband might become president of the 
town of Lubao, as did happen, remain unexplained; but even putting aside such a 
theory and regarding it as a coincidence, it appears in the case that the 
injured woman Anselma Garcia consented to the concubinage of her husband from 
1902 up to the date of her last complaint in January, 1913; and therefore, under 
the provisions of article 434 of the Penal Code, her complaint of concubinage 
with scandal must be dismissed by reason of her consent, indicated by her 
silence for over ten years.</p>
<p>It is to be noted that said crime is of almost a public nature, although for 
the prosecution and punishment thereof the cause must be instituted by virtue of 
a complaint of the injured spouse, in accordance with the last paragraph of 
article 437 of the Penal Code; and as it is not a crime-of a private nature, it 
is not enumerated in Act No. 1773. </p>
<p>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment appealed from should be reversed and 
the case dismissed along with the complaint that instituted it, with the costs 
in both instances <em>de officio</em>. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Johnson</em> and <em>Araullo,. JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em>Carson, J., </em>concurs in the result.</p>
