				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>It  appears from  the record in  this case that on the evening of the 19th  of July,  1904, the  defendant, Angel Montes, had trouble with his tenant, Pascual de la Cruz, about the destruction of a seed plot wherein  were growing young rice plants, and that  he, the defendant, beat him across the back with some tool or instrument, and kicked him  in  the  abdomen,  thereby  causing a  rupture of the spleen and of the splenic artery which was followed by an internal hemorrhage, as a result of which the deceased died a few hours later.   The deceased, after having been thus assaulted  by the defendant,  was hardly  able to  descend from the house and return to his home, being obliged to drag himself along the ground on account of the intense pain and weakness resulting  from his injuries.  He then succeeded  in climbing the steps of his own house and, once there, informed his wife and his uncle, Baldomero Lazaro, of what had  taken place.</p>
<p>Dr. Justo Panis,  president of the provincial board of health, testified that the defendant called on him  about 7 o'clock on the following morning and,  after a short conversation about  the condition of the rice fields and his carabaos, told him, Dr. Panis, that he, the defendant, had been surprised to hear of the death  of one of his  tenants whom he  had only reprimanded and  struck across  the buttocks with a cane for some  fault.  While at the doctor's house he was arrested by the police.</p>
<p>It appears from  the investigation and examination of the body of the deceased made by the aforesaid doctor and the municipal physician, Hilario Jacinto, that blood clots had formed  in the abdominal cavity as  a result  of the rupture  of the splenic artery which was  followed by a copious flow of blood, resulting in the death of the deceased. The skin was also discolored  where  the blows had fallen, the doctors being of the opinion that death was the result of a traumatic wound upon the left hypochondrium and rupture  of the said  artery and the hemorrhage  which followed  it.</p>
<p>The trial court, after considering the evidence adduced during the trial,  sentenced the defendant to twelve years and  one  day of imprisonment (<em>reclusion temporal</em>)  and accessory penalties, and to pay an indemnification and the costs of the proceedings, from which judgment and sentence the defendant appealed.</p>
<p>The beating of the deceased, Pascual de la Cruz, by the defendant, Angel Montes, in violation of the law, is fully established by the evidence of record and it does not matter what his motive was.  If the deceased died as a result of such injuries the nature of the wrongful act committed by the defendant should be determined by taking into consideration the extent and effect of the same.</p>
<p>The facts hereinbefore set out clearly show  the commission of the crime of homicide as defined and  punished in article 404 of the Penal Code, and the evidence does  not disclose the existence of any of the  circumstances enumerated in article 403 which would require the imposition of a more severe penalty, since it appears that  the death of the deceased, Pascual de la Cruz, was caused by the rupture of the splenic  artery brought about by a traumatic wound in the left  hypochondriacal region which was  followed by a copious internal hemorrhage.</p>
<p>The acts committed by the defendant, Montes, to  wit, the beating of the deceased with a blunt instrument and kicking him in the abdominal region, were voluntarily and willfully committed.  These acts  are notoriously unlawful and contrary  to law, and the party  responsible therefor should be held liable for the crime of homicide thus committed.   He who commits an unlawful act, such as the maltreatment or beating of a person, should be held responsible for all the consequences of his criminal action, even though it was not his intention to  kill the person assaulted. (See article 1 of the  Penal Code and criminal judgments of the supreme court of Spain of March 10, 1871, June 26, 1880,  and July 3,1889, which refer to the construction and application of the provisions of the Penal Code, which is almost identical with the one in force in these Islands.)</p>
<p>The deceased, De la Cruz, walked  to the  defendant's house unaided on the  night in question and appeared to be in good health, and it does not appear that he was suffering from any illness at the time, but when he left the house of the defendant, after having been assaulted by the latter, he was obliged to drag himself along the ground to his house, as he was barely able to walk because of the intense pain and extreme weakness which he experienced, and his wife, Flora Libunao, had to help him up the stairs and into the house, he dying shortly after he was laid down upstairs. The post-mortem examination held  by the two physicians shows conclusively  that the kicks and blows received by the deceased were the direct cause of his death.  In an ante-mortem statement the deceased told his wife what had occurred, and she repeated the statement to the court under oath, her testimony being corroborated by that of the uncle of the deceased, who was also present and heard the statement made by the deceased.</p>
<p>Hearsay testimony is not as a rule admissible, but in a prosecution for the crime of murder or homicide the statement of the  deceased as to the cause of his death or  any circumstance connected therewith should be taken  into consideration if, in the judgment of the court, the deceased when making such statement was in imminent danger of death and without hope of living.   Such was the critical condition of  the deceased, Pascual de la Cruz, in this case when he made  the said statement to  his wife.   He  died almost immediately  and it is not probable that while in such a critical condition he would have made a false statement or accused the defendant falsely.</p>
<p>It is apparent that the defendant had no intention of killing the deceased, De la Cruz, and that through the fault or negligence of the latter as a tenant the  defendant's seed plot was damaged or ruined.  This loss and damage to his property caused the  latter to lose his self-control.   These facts show very plainly the existence  of  extenuating circumstances 3 and 7  of article 9 of the Penal Code, there being no aggravating circumstances to offset them.   In accordance with rule 5 of article 81 of the Penal  Code  the penalty which should be imposed upon the  defendant is that immediately lower than the one provided for in article 404, to wit, that of <em>prision mayor </em>in its minimum degree.</p>
<p>This case is similar to the case of the United States vs. Ricardo Luciano, for homicide (No. 1041, 2 Phil. Rep. 96).</p>
<p>For the reason hereinbefore stated we are of the opinion that  the judgment of the court below  should be reversed and the defendant, Angel Montes, sentenced to six years and six months' imprisonment (<em>prision mayor</em>), with the accessory penalties provided in article 61 of the Penal Code, and to indemnify  the widow and heirs of the deceased in the amount of 1,000 pesos, and to pay the costs.  After the expiration of ten days from the date of final judgment the case will be remanded to the court below for proper action. So ordered.</p>
