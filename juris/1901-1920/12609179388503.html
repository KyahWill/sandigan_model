				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is an ordinary  action on a promissory note to  recover the sum of $1,150, United States currency, with  interest thereon at the rate of 25 per cent per annum from September 14,1903, the date of the note, until its payment. The action was commenced on the 21st of April, 1904, and on the 25th of April  the plaintiff procured an attachment of the property of the defendant under the provisions of section 424 and  following sections of  the  Code of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p>The affidavit for attachment  stated  that  the defendant had  disposed of his property or is about to dispose of his property  with intent to defraud his creditors.   By virtue of the writ of attachment the sheriff levied upon the launch Ncotia,  the  property  of the  defendant.  The defendant moved in  the court below to dissolve the attachment, which motion  was denied, and to  the order denying it he took an exception.   The case was  tried in the court below,  and judgment entered for the plaintiff for the face of the note with interest at the rate of 25 per cent per  annum from the 14th day of September, 1903, until the debt was paid. The defendant  has brought the case here by bill of exceptions, and makes two assignments of errors.</p>
<p>The first relates to the sufficiency of the affidavit upon which the attachment was  granted.  The claim of the defendant  is that the  affidavit was insufficient because the allegation  as to the  transfer of  property  was in  the alternative.</p>
<p>An affidavit which stated in the alternative two reasons for the attachment, one of which  was by the statute  a ground therefor and the other was not, would be bad, because, while it stated that one or the other ground existed, it did not state which one, and the one that did in fact exist might be the one which was not sufficient to authorize the issuance of the writ.  In such a case it could be truthfully said that the affidavit did  not  state the existence of  any ground for attachment.  That, however, can not be said where the affidavit states in the alternative, as it does in this case, two grounds, either one of which would justify the attachment.  If one does not exist the other must.   It therefore states positively  the existence of a ground  for attachment.   The objection that could be made to such an affidavit is not  that it does not state a ground for attachment,  but that it is indefinite in  not  stating positively which one of several grounds alleged exists.   This ought not to be sufficient to render the attachment void.   In some cases, as in this, it might be impossible to state truthfully which one of the two grounds did in fact exist.  The plaintiff might have information that the  defendant  was attempting to dispose of his property  with intent to defraud his creditors.  At the time when he  swears to the affidavit, which must necessarily be some time after he acquires the information, he can not know just how far the defendant has proceeded in  his attempt.  At that precise time  the fraudulent sale comtemplated may have been actually consummated, without the plaintiff  knowing it.  In such  a case he would be justified  in making the affidavit in  the alternative.  In some, perhaps in a majority, of the States of the United States such an affidavit as the one in this case would be held bad.  There are other courts of the United States, however, in which it would be held good.</p>
<p>With the motion to dissolve the attachment  the defendant presented his affidavit to  the effect that he had  not disposed of and did not intend to dispose of his  property for the purpose of defrauding his creditors.  Upon this question of fact we do not think that the preponderance of the evidence is against the  decision of the trial court. At the hearing of this motion plaintiff, in  addition to the affidavit on which the attachment was granted, presented a supporting affidavit in  which he  gave the source of his information as to the proposed sale.</p>
<p>Section 426 of the  Code of Civil Procedure provides, among other things, that the judge shall grant an  order of attachment when it appears "that the case is one of those mentioned in section  four hundred and twenty-four, and that there is  no other sufficient security for the  claim sought to be enforced  by  the action."</p>
<p>It appears that the  plaintiff at the time that the launch <span style="font-style: italic;">Scotia </span>was attached in this proceeding had what is known in the United States as  a chattel  mortgage on  the said launch to secure the note sued on in this case, and  other notes.   The claim of  the appellant is that this  so-called chattel  mortgage  constituted  other security  within  the meaning of section 426, and that the attachment was therefore void.  The plaintiff's answer to this claim is that hie so-called chattel mortgage was void under the laws in force in these Islands, and therefore there was no security at all.</p>
<p>We do not find it necessary to pass upon the validity of this instrument.  The object of the  statute was to prevent the creditor, who already had  security on certain goods, from attaching other  goods to secure  the same debt.  It was not, in our opinion, intended to apply to a  case where the plaintiff caused his attachment to  be levied upon  the very article upon  which  the security  existed,  and in an action to recover the debt which was so secured.  In fact, under the Spanish law of civil procedure, in  an action to recover a debt thus secured the property first to be attached is that upon which the security rested.  What the effect of this attachment upon the security is we do not decide. We  simply hold that section 426  does  not prevent an attachment of the article upon which the security rests for the debt thus secured.</p>
<p>The question raised by the assignment of error in regard to the interest has been decided adversely to the appellant in the case of the Banco Espa√±ol Filipino <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Donaldson Sim &amp; Co., No. 2422.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> On motion for a rehearing in that case it was held that a judgment of a Court of First Instance  which directed the payment of interest from the date of default until the final payment of the judgment was authorized by the law, and that  section 510 of the Code of Civil Procedure did not apply to such a case.</p>
<p>The judgment of the court  below is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant, and after the expiration of twenty days judgment should be entered in accordance herewith and the case remanded to the court below for  execution of said judgment. So ordered.</p>
