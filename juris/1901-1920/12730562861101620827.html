				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Remigio Tongson and Doña Marcelina Florentino were husband and wife, the latter dying in the year 1899.&nbsp; Dona Marcelina Florentino brought to the marriage a considerable amount of property,&nbsp; part of which&nbsp; appears in the inventory found on page 8 of&nbsp; the bill of exceptions.<br><br>After&nbsp; the death of Doña Marcelina Florentino, her husband continued&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; administration of the property of the marital relation until on or about&nbsp; the 30th of&nbsp; April, 1906, when the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of the Province of Ilocos Sur,&nbsp; upon the petition of certain&nbsp; relatives of the deceased Doña Marcelina&nbsp; Florentino,&nbsp; appointed Prudencio Espiritu administrator&nbsp; of her estate and ordered said administrator to take possession&nbsp; of the&nbsp; property found in the said&nbsp; inventory.&nbsp;&nbsp; The appointment of the&nbsp; said administrator was opposed in the&nbsp; Court of First Instance by Remigio Tongson, upon the grounds:<br><br>First.&nbsp; That&nbsp; he was the husband of Doña Marcelina Florentino&nbsp; and was, therefore, entitled to&nbsp; the administration of the marital property; and<br><br>Second. That&nbsp; much of the property&nbsp; mentioned in said inventory was not&nbsp; the&nbsp; sole and separate property of his former wife, but was conjugal property.<br><br>Notwithstanding this objection, however, the court appointed the administrator.<br><br>During the pendency of the action in&nbsp; the Court of First Instance, Remigio Tongson died, and the defense was continued by his administrator, Jose Singson&nbsp; Tongson, who had been duly and regularly appointed by the lower court.<br><br>From&nbsp; the order of the lower court permitting the administrator of the deceased wife to administer the property in question, the defendant appealed and made several&nbsp; assignments of error in this court.<br><br>The important question presented in the record is whether or not, after the death of his wife, a husband can be deprived of the right to administer the marital property,&nbsp; composed of both conjugal and paraphernal&nbsp; property,&nbsp; by the appointment of an administrator for the estate of the deceased wife.<br><br>We have already decided in the case&nbsp; of Alfonso <i>vs.</i> Natividad (6&nbsp; Phil. Rep., 240)&nbsp; that&nbsp; when&nbsp; the conjugal&nbsp; partnership is dissolved by the death of the husband, it must be liquidated&nbsp; in proceedings for the settlement&nbsp; of the&nbsp; estate of the&nbsp; husband,&nbsp; basing said decision&nbsp; upon&nbsp; articles 685 [Code of Civil&nbsp; Procedure], and 1407, 1412, 1418, 1426, and 1428&nbsp; of the Civil Code.<br><br>In&nbsp; the case of Prado <i>vs.</i> Lagera (7 Phil. Rep.,&nbsp; 395), the decision in the case of Alfonso <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Natividad was affirmed and it was there decided that where&nbsp; the affairs of the conjugal partnership, dissolved by&nbsp; the death of the husband, are in process&nbsp; of litigation&nbsp; in proceedings for the settlement of his estate, the widow can not maintain an action against his administrator for the purpose&nbsp; of recovering either her part&nbsp; of the conjugal property or her&nbsp; <i>bienes parafernales.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; (Arts. 1421, 1422,&nbsp; 1423, Civil Code.)<br><br>The foregoing cases establish&nbsp; the&nbsp; method&nbsp; of administering the estate of&nbsp; a conjugal partnership&nbsp; when&nbsp; the same is dissolved by the death of the husband.<br><br>In the case of Enriquez <i>vs.</i> Victoria (10 Phil. Rep., 10), this court established&nbsp; the&nbsp; method of&nbsp; administering the property of a&nbsp; conjugal&nbsp; partnership&nbsp; when&nbsp; it&nbsp; is&nbsp; dissolved by the death of the&nbsp; wife.&nbsp; The method&nbsp; established is that when a conjugal partnership is dissolved by the&nbsp; death&nbsp; of the wife, the husband is the administrator of the affairs of the partnership until they are liquidated.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the&nbsp; event of a dissolution by&nbsp; the&nbsp; death of&nbsp; the husband or in&nbsp; case of the demise of the husband after the&nbsp; dissolution by the death of the wife, his administrator is also the administrator of the partnership affairs and is the legal representative of the partnership.<br><br>In the&nbsp; case of Amancio<i> vs.</i> Pardo (13 Phil. Rep.,&nbsp; 297), this court again affirmed its former decision and held that:<br><blockquote>"When a conjugal partnership is&nbsp; dissolved&nbsp; by the&nbsp; death of the&nbsp; wife,&nbsp; the surviving&nbsp; husband, and not the judicial administrator appointed in&nbsp; the proceedings for the settlement of the estate, is entitled to the possession of the&nbsp; property&nbsp; of the&nbsp; conjugal&nbsp; partnership until&nbsp; he has liquidated its affairs.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is&nbsp; an&nbsp; error to&nbsp; settle the&nbsp; affairs of the conjugal&nbsp; partnership, dissolved by the death&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; wife, in the special proceedings for the settlement of the wife's estate."</blockquote>These decisions in our opinion are conclusive on the&nbsp; question presented in the present case.&nbsp; Therefore&nbsp; the administrator of the deceased husband, Remigio Tongson, is entitled to the&nbsp; administration of the conjugal property&nbsp; until the same is liquidated.&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the view which we take of the facts in the present case and the doctrine established in the above-cited cases, we deem it unnecessary to discuss&nbsp; more in detail the assignments of error&nbsp; made by the appellant.<br><br>Basing&nbsp; our conclusions upon the above decisions of this court, it&nbsp; is hereby ordered that the appointment of the administrator of the estate of the deceased Doña Marcelina Florentino is hereby&nbsp; ordered annulled and it is further ordered that the administrator appointed for the estate of the deceased Remigio Tongson, upon giving a sufficient bond to be approved by the lower court, be given the possession of all of the conjugal property belonging to the said conjugal partnership of Remigio Tongson and Doña Marcelina Florentino, and that he be directed to proceed to the liquidation and distribution of said property as speedily as possible.<br><br>Without any finding as to costs, it is so ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Moreland,</i> and <i>Trent, JJ</i>., concur.<br></div>
