				<H3>LUIS ESPERANZA AND BALTAZAR BULLO, AS ATTORNEYS IN FACT FOR FLORENTINO ESPERANZA, PLAINTIFFS AND APPELLANTS, VS. ANDREA CATINDING, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><strong></strong>This action was instituted by Luis Esperanza and Baltazar Bullo, acting as 
<em>apoderados</em><p> (attorneys in fact) for and on behalf of Florentino 
Esperanza, for the recovery of certain described real property situated at 
Anaoaon, municipality of Surigao, Province of Surigao, and which the petition 
alleges is unlawfully held and claimed by the defendant.</p>
<p>Upon the proof adduced at the trial of the cause judgment was entered in the 
court below dismissing the complaint, and from this judgment the present appeal 
is prosecuted.</p>
<p>The trial judge made a very full statement of the facts upon which he based 
his judgment, and after a careful examination of the record we are of opinion 
that the record fully supports the conclusions reached by the lower court. 
Practically the only question presented by this appeal is the degree of credit 
which should have been accorded to the witnesses who testified. Not only have 
the plaintiffs failed to establish their contention by a preponderance of the 
evidence but even out of the mouths of their own witnesses they have refuted the 
very facts upon which their claim rests.</p>
<p>The record establishes that one Julian Catmon, the grandfather of the 
defendant, was the owner and in possession of various parcels of land during his 
lifetime, including the parcel now in question. After his death these several 
parcels of land were partitioned among his children and the parcel in question 
came into the possession of his daughter Venancia Catmon, who was married to 
Ramon Catinding and to whom there were born four children, Policarpio, Andrea 
(the defendant), Ruperto and Eulogio. The record shows that Venancia Catmon and 
Ramon Catinding were married during the lifetime of Julian Catmon and that they 
built a small house on the land and lived there for a number of years. Andrea 
Catinding, the defendant, appears to have made her home with her grandfather, 
Julian Catmon, who lived in another house nearby on the same land. Venancia 
Catmon the first wife of Ramon Catinding and the mother of the defendant, died, 
and shortly therefore Ramon Catinding married one Sabina Butron and with his 
second wife came and lived on the land in question for a short space of 
time.</p>
<p>The record does not establish the dates of these various events. It merely 
shows that for many years the land in question was in the possession of the 
grandfather; that it passed from him to his daughter Venancia, who with her 
husband Ramon Catinding and their children continued living on the land; that 
after the death of Venancia the surviving husband Ramon married again and came 
and lived with his second wife on the land for a short time only. In the 
meantime it appears that Andrea, the defendant, had married a Spaniard named 
Gonzalez, who died in 1896. During at least a part of the time that Andrea was 
married to Gonzalez she did not live on the land, but it appears that her 
brother Eulogio, who was married at this time, had been living on the land. The 
record shows that there were at least two houses on this land. After the death 
of her husband in 1896 Andrea returned to the land and has continued living 
there up to the present time, or at any rate was living on the land at the time 
his action was instituted.</p>
<p>In December, 1898, Ramon Catinding and Sabina Butron executed a deed to the 
land in question to Baltazar Bullo who claims that he purchased it for his 
grandson Florentino Esperanza, and again in May, 1904, Ramon Catinding and 
Sabina Butron went before a justice of the peace at Surigao and executed another 
deed to Baltazar Bullo for the same land. This last deed appears to have been 
executed in order to overcome any defects that might be found in the first 
instrument. A great deal of the proof offered by plaintiffs relates to the 
execution of these deeds. It is not denied that these deeds were executed but it 
is claimed by the defendant that Ramon Catinding and Sabina Butron had no title 
whatever to the land, and for that reason no rights or interests which could be 
conveyed by these deeds. </p>
<p>Plaintiffs deny that the land in question was ever a part of the land of 
defendant's grandfather, Julian Catmon, or that it had ever been the property of 
Venancia Catmon, defendant's mother; they assert that the land was entered upon 
by Ramon Catinding and Sabina Butron while it was yet unclaimed and uncultivated 
land; that it was first cultivated by them and that their title in the land was 
by reason of this original occupancy. While the plaintiffs introduced some 
evidence tending to establish this fact they utterly failed to establish it by a 
preponderance of the evidence. Even the plaintiffs' own witnesses, Maria Ciceros 
(pp. 35, 36, 37 of the record) and Baltazar Bullo, the person who claims to have 
purchased the land (pp. 41 and 42), admitted that the defendant had been in 
possession of this land for a number of years at the time the deed was executed, 
and had been cultivating the land and receiving the benefits therefrom. On the 
other hand the defendant introduced a number of witnesses who were familiar with 
the land in question and who testified positively and emphatically that the land 
had formerly belonged to Julian Catmon, had descended from him to his daughter 
Venancia, and that it had been held and claimed by her children since her death. 
The record seems to be conclusive upon the fact that Ramon Catinding's 
connection with this land was by reason of his wife's ownership and that she had 
inherited it from her father; To reach any other conclusion means absolutely to 
disregard the weight of the evidence in the record. The record does not support 
the conclusion that Ramon Catinding and his second wife, Sabina Butron, were the 
first to enter upon this land and cultivate it, and without proof of that 
alleged fact the whole case for the plaintiffs must fall.</p>
<p>But while we have reviewed the evidence of record in this case for a similar 
reason to that announced for a like action in the case of Arroyo vs. Granada (18 
Phil. Rep., 484), that is to say, in the hope that what we have said "may have 
the effect of forestalling further litigation" the judgment entered in the court 
below must be modified, under the authority of the former decision, so as to 
provide for the dismissal of the complaint, not upon the merits, but upon the 
ground that the action was not properly instituted, having been brought in the 
name of apoderados (attorneys in fact), and not in the name of the real party in 
interest.</p>
<p>Let judgment be entered modifying the judgment entered in the court below, so 
as to provide for a dismissal of the complaint, not upon the merits, but on the 
ground that it was improperly instituted, not having been brought in the name of 
the real party in interest, with the costs of both instances against the 
appellants.</p>
