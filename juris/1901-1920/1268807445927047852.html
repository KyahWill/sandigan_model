				G.R. No. 12979, January 28, 1918</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. SIXTO BALMES, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The defendant and appellant was convicted in the court below of 
<em>atentado</em>, and sentenced to two years, four months, and one day of 
<em>prision correctional</em> and to pay a fine of 625 pesetas, under the 
provisions of the first paragraph of article 250 of the Penal Code. The penalty 
was placed under this paragraph upon a finding that the accused assaulted a 
policeman with an oar. It appears that the policeman who was endeavoring to 
arrest suspected violators of an ordinance relating to the municipal fisheries, 
stepped over into the boat of an uncle of the accused to count the fish in the 
bottom of the boat, and that the accused stepped into the boat at or about the 
same time, evidently with the intention of opposing the action of the policeman 
in coming on board his uncle's boat. Words passed between them, and in the 
darkness and confusion of the moment the boat was upset, and both parties were 
compelled to struggle ashore as best they could. Some of the witnesses for the 
prosecution insist that the accused tried to strike the policeman with his oar, 
and that the boat was upset in the struggle for possession of the oar. The 
incident occurred at night, the evidence as to exactly what did occur is 
conflicting and unsatisfactory. We do not think the evidence supports a finding 
beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused made any attempt to use the oar as a 
weapon of defense, though it well may be that in trying to balance themselves in 
the small boat, both parties tried to get hold of it. We are satisfied, however, 
that the accused resisted the policeman in the performance of his duty. We think 
that the offense proved to have been committed is that penalized in the last 
paragraph of article 250 of the Penal Code.
<p>We do not find that the force used against the policeman was such as is 
contemplated in subsections 1, 2, 3, or 4 of article 250, under the rule 
announced in the case of U. S. <em>vs</em>. Tabiana and Canillas (p. 515, 
<em>post</em>) recently decided.</p>
<p>We conclude, therefore, that the penalty imposed by the trial judge should be 
modified by substituting one year, eight months, and twenty-one days of 
<em>prision correccional</em> and a fine of 375 <em>pesetas</em>, with 
subsidiary imprisonment as prescribed by law, for so much thereof as imposes two 
years, four months, and one day of <em>prision correccional</em> and to pay a 
fine of 625 <em>pesetas</em>, and that thus modified, the judgment should be 
affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Johnson, Araullo, Street</em>, and <em>Malcolm, 
JJ.</em>, concur.</p></div>
