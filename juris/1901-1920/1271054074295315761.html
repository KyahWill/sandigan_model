				<BR><STRONG>TRENT, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal from a judgment of the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of the Second Judicial District, Honorable Dionisio Chanco&nbsp; presiding, condemning the defendant,&nbsp; Isidro Madamba, to pay a fine of P200 and the costs of the cause for the crime of having violated the provisions of paragraph 8, section 29, and paragraph 20, section&nbsp; 30, of the Election Law.<br><br>A&nbsp; vacancy&nbsp; having occurred&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; office of municipal president of the town of Dingras, Province of Ilocos Norte, the provincial&nbsp; board, by resolution approved October 30, 1908,&nbsp; appointed the defendant, Isidro Madamba, to fill this vacancy.&nbsp; Immediately thereafter&nbsp; Madamba accepted&nbsp; the appointment and&nbsp; after qualifying&nbsp; entered upon the duties of his office.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the 2d of August, 1909, Madamba presented his resignation, in writing,&nbsp; as such appointed president, to the provincial board, for the purpose of becoming a candidate for&nbsp; the same&nbsp; office&nbsp; at the general election to be&nbsp; held on&nbsp; the 2d day of November of that year.&nbsp;&nbsp; His resignation was accepted&nbsp; on the 18th&nbsp; of that&nbsp; month and he received notification of&nbsp; such acceptance on the 25th of .the same month.&nbsp; Upon&nbsp; receipt of this notice he then ceased to perform the functions of that office and to receive the emoluments attached&nbsp; thereto.&nbsp; He&nbsp; then publicly&nbsp; announced to the voters of that municipality that he was a candidate for the office of municipal president.&nbsp; These facts are not disputed.<br><br>Paragraph 8, section 29, of the Election Law, as amended by section 3 of Act No. 1948, reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"No person, except a notary public, holding any appointive public office&nbsp; or employment,&nbsp; or any public office or employment by&nbsp; appointment,&nbsp; shall,&nbsp; within ninety&nbsp; days preceding any general election, or within sixty days preceding&nbsp; any special&nbsp; election,&nbsp; announce&nbsp; his&nbsp; candidacy for or be eligible to&nbsp; hold&nbsp; any elective public office&nbsp; or employment to be filled at such&nbsp; general or special election.&nbsp; No person holding an elective public office to which such person has&nbsp; been elected shall&nbsp; present his&nbsp; candidacy, nor&nbsp; shall he be eligible while holding such office, at any municipal, provincial&nbsp; or Assembly election,&nbsp; except for reelection to the office held by him.&nbsp; Resignations tendered for electoral reasons&nbsp; shall&nbsp; be&nbsp; accepted&nbsp; without delay by the officer or person called upon to accept them.&nbsp; The resignations mentioned in this section shall,&nbsp; in the case&nbsp; of Delegates to the Philippine Assembly, be tendered to the Speaker thereof. No judge of&nbsp; the Court of First&nbsp; Instance, justice ,of the peace, provincial&nbsp; fiscal, or officer or employee of&nbsp; the Bureau of Constabulary&nbsp; or&nbsp; of the Bureau of&nbsp; Education,&nbsp; or provincial treasurer, shall aid any candidate, or influence in any manner or take any part in any municipal,&nbsp; provincial, or Assembly election under penalty of&nbsp; being deprived of his office and being disqualified to hold any public office whatever for a term of five years: Provided, however, That the foregoing provisions shall not be construed&nbsp; to deprive any person&nbsp; otherwise qualified of&nbsp; the right to vote at any election: And <i>provided further, </i> That the tender in writing of a resignation&nbsp; within the time&nbsp; herein above&nbsp; fixed shall be held to&nbsp; be a compliance with the requirements of this section."</blockquote>Paragraph 20,&nbsp; section 30, of the Election&nbsp; Law provides that:<br><blockquote>"Any person who, being disqualified for an office for any reason other than nonpayment of taxes, publicly announces his candidacy for any elective office, shall be punished by a fine of not less than two hundred pesos nor&nbsp; more than five hundred pesos."&nbsp; <br></blockquote>From&nbsp; the date (August&nbsp; 2d) of the&nbsp; presentation by the defendant of his resignation&nbsp; in writing to the second of November, the date on which the general election was held, is a period of ninety-one days, excluding both dates.&nbsp;&nbsp; He therefore did not present his resignation within the ninety days specified in the section above quoted.&nbsp; It will be noted that the last part of said section reads:<br><blockquote>"<i>And provided further</i>, That the tender in writing of a resignation within the time herein above fixed shall be held to be a compliance with the requirements of this section." <br></blockquote>Under this&nbsp; provision the defendant complied with the law, and he then and there (on the second day of August) ceased&nbsp; to be such municipal president by appointment, and from that date&nbsp; to&nbsp; the twenty-fifth of&nbsp; the&nbsp; month he was <i> de facto</i> municipal president for the purposes of this case. The&nbsp; intention of the Legislature in amending paragraph 8, section&nbsp; 29,&nbsp; of the Election Law, in the manner&nbsp; above set forth was to cover such cases&nbsp; as the one under consideration.<br><br>For these reasons the judgment appealed from is reversed and the&nbsp; defendant acquitted,&nbsp; with&nbsp; costs&nbsp; <i>de&nbsp; oficio.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J., Mapa, Carso</i>n, and <i>Moreland, JJ</i>., concur.<br></div>
