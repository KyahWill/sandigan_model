				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The motion that the defendant be  included in the amnesty of July 4,1902, must be denied.</p>
<p>To entitle a  person to the benefits of this  proclamation two things, at least, must concur: (1) He must have participated in the insurrections against  Spain or the United States.   (2) The crime with which he is charged must be political  in its  nature.  Common crimes, such as murder and robbery, are not included within the amnesty unless they were  committed under  circumstances  which  clothe them with a political character.  This court has constantly adhered to this doctrine. In the present case, while it appears that the offense was  committed by insurrectionary soldiers, there  is  no evidence  that it was of a political  nature.   (United States <em>vs.</em> Villamor, 1 Off. Gaz., Dec. 31, 1902.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>)   The charge is illegal detention.  The defendant and an armed  band of six persons, of which  he  was the leader,  presented themselves at  the house of Gregorio Mistica, compelled him and his wife,  Caledonia Santos, to leave it, robbed it, and then carried the man and wife into a neighboring barrio.  The husband was separated from the wife, who was guarded by the defendant.   The rest of the band carried the husband into the woods  and soon returned with the statement that he had been killed.  The wife was kept by the defendant and his companions for nine days, when she escaped, her guards having been frightened by the approach of some American soldiers.  The woman testified that the persons. attacking the house were soldiers of  Morales.   The customary evidence that the person killed was believed by the defendants to be a spy of the Americans is entirely wanting in this case.  There is nothing in it to indicate that he was not as friendly to the Filipinos as to the Americans.  But it is said that, the  offense having been committed by soldiers, it must be presumed, in the absence of any evidence as to motive, that it was to further the purposes of  the insurrection, and therefore  political in its  nature.   The  event took place in November, 1900, in the Province of Bulacan. Malolos had been captured by the  Americans more than a year and a half before, and for a  long time this province had been garrisoned by the forces  of that Government. While at the'time here in question there may have existed in this locality small bands of former insurrectionary soldiers, like the one led by this defendant, there was nothing that could in any sense be called an organized, disciplined, fighting force—nothing that could  in any respect be called an army.</p>
<p>It is to be noted  that in this case there was evidence to prove the crime of robbery, and that of  probable murder, punished by article 483 of the Penal Code.  To apply the presumption suggested would  be to release in large numbers the members of those bands  of outlaws  who, up  to May 1, 1902, committed so many  murders and robberies throughout  the  provinces.   If  it appeared that they had been soldiers in the insurrection,  and the motive for the crime did not appear, they  would have  to be  discharged. The Government could  avoid this  result only by proving affirmatively that  the motive  for  the  crime was not political.  A construction  that leads to  such results ought not to be given to the proclamation.</p>
<p>Whatever may have been the motive in this case, whether robbery or the abduction of the woman, or something else, its political  character has not been made to appear. Tlte motion is therefore denied.</p>

<em>DISSENTING</em></div>
<p> MCDONOUGH  J.,  with  whom concurs  COOPER, J..:</p>
<p>The defendants are charged with the crime  of illegal detention in that,  in November, 1900, in the town of Marilao, Province of Bulacan, they broke into the house of one Gregorio Mistica, robbed him,  and took him and his wife prisoners.  The band who committed this crime consisted of eight persons, all of whom were soldiers except one.   After  plundering the house they took Mistica and his  wife,  in a banca, to Tagalag, and while  there the husband was taken awav bv six  of the soldiers, the  wife remaining in  the  custody of the defendant Luzon; and soon after the departure  of the husband these soldiers returned, saying that the husband was dead.   The wife, after being in the custody  of said defendant about nine days, made her escape,  taking advantage of  the  fact that two soldiers who guarded her had relaxed their vigilance because of the approach of the Americans.   She testified that she knew Luzon, that he was a friend of her husband, and had been at her house twice before this occurrence.</p>
<p>One of the witnesses testified that he himself  had been taken prisoner by this band of soldiers on  the night in question and  placed  under  the  house  of  Mistica,  from which place he escaped while the men were  upstairs.  It was  shown  by another witness  that Luzon was  one of Morales's soldiers.</p>
<p>The defendant Luzon at the trial attempted to prove an alibi, but did not succeed in doing so to the satisfaction of the court below.</p>
<p>He was found guilty and sentenced to imprisonment for a term of seventeen years four months and one day.</p>
<p>He now makes application for leave to take the oath and for his discharge, under the amnesty proclamation of the President of the United States issued July 4, 1902.</p>
<p>This proclamation recites  the  fact  of the existence of insurrection in these Islands  against Spanish sovereignty, and of the resistance to the authority and  sovereignty of the United States, since the cession of the Archipelago, and that during the course of said insurrection persons engaged therein, or in sympathy with and abetting them, committed many acts in violation of the lawrs of civilized  warfare; and recites the further fact that it is deemed to be wise and humane and conducive to peace, order, and loyalty among them that the doers of such acts shall not he held criminally responsible, but shall be relieved from punishment for participation in these insurrections <em>and for unlawful acts</em> committed during the course thereof.</p>
<p>Therefore, upon  their  taking  a prescribed oath, the President granted a full and complete pardon and amnesty :</p>
<p>(1)  To all persons in  the Philippine Archipelago who have participated in the insurrections  aforesaid; or</p>
<p>(2)  Who have given aid and comfort to persons participating in said insurrections, for the offenses  of treason or sedition, and for all offenses, <em>political in their character</em>, committed in the course  of such insuirections, pursuant to orders issued by the civil or military  insurrectionary authorities; or</p>
<p>(3) Which grew out of internal political feuds or dissensions between Filipinos and Spaniards; or</p>
<p>(4)  Which  resulted from  internal political feuds  or dissensions among the Filipinos  themselves during either of said insurrections.</p>
<p>Persons committing such crimes since May 1,1902, when the civil government was  established, and persons theretofore  finally convicted of the crimes of murder, rape, arson, or robbery by a military or civil tribunal organized under the authority of Spain or the United States, were excluded from the benefits of the amnesty.</p>
<p>The  application of Luzon is resisted on the ground that the offense of which he was convicted is not included in the amnesty proclamation, in that it is not of a political character and was not committed pursuant to orders of the civil or military authorities.</p>
<p>This  court held in the Abad case  (1 Off.  Gaz.,  357)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> that  in construing an executive act of the character  of this  proclamation, as in  construing  a remedial  statute, a court is justified in applying a more liberal rule of construction  in order to effectuate, if possible, the beneficial purposes intended.</p>
<p>This rule of construction  seems to have been strictly followed in the many cases passed upon by this court since the proclamation was issued, and by which the punishment for many horrible crimes and cruelties—acts contrary to the rules of civilized warfare—was remitted.  A reference to some  of these cases may throw  light on the present question.</p>
<p>In the case of United  States <em>vs.</em> Manuel Repollo et al. (1 Off. Gaz., 291 )<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> the defendant was charged with murder under the following circumstances: He was a member of the Katipunan Society, and one of the town council of the barrio  of San Juan.  In November, 1899, two insurgent soldiers told him there was a spy in the barrio, and that he was ordered by his superiors  to seize this man, named Limon, who, it was alleged, informed the Americans where the insurrectos Avere stationed.  Thereupon the defendant, accompanied  by four soldiers with  guns and fifteen men with bolos, seized Limon and carried him to the two insurrectos,  who, without waiting for judge, council, or verdict, immediately decapitated  the  prisoner, throwing his head on the roadway 300 feet away from his body.</p>
<p>This defendant claimed, and the court decided, that his case came within the provisions of  the proclamation, his crime being of a political character and committed, as was alleged, pursuant to orders.  Stress was laid upon the fact that the defendant and the murdered man were neighbors who knew each other many  years and between whom no ill feeling existed, and hence the strong probability that the motive for the killing was political.</p>
<p>In the  case of Maximo Abad (1 Off. Gaz., 357 )<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> the defendant had been convicted of a violation of his oath of loyalty to the United States, in that he denied to an officer of the Army the existence of certain rifles which  had been concealed by his orders when he surrendered, he well knowing the place  of concealment.  It was held in this case that the violation of his oath by the defendant was included in the words "treason and sedition," as used in the amnesty proclamation,  and that the defendant was entitled to the benefits of the proclamation, although it does not appear in the report of the case that in violating his oath he acted pursuant to orders issued  by  civil or military  insurrectionary authorities.</p>
<p>In United States <em>vs.</em> Santillana et al. (1 Off. Gaz., 379)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> it appeared that the defendant, Santillana, acted as judge-advocate of a so-called council of war held in the Province of Occidental Negros in September, 1899, by which council it was ordered that one Juan Carballo be brought before that body for trial, on a charge of being an American spy and guide,  and in case he resisted it was ordered that he should be killed.   The defendant delivered this order to those charged with its execution.  There was  no attempt made to arrest and try Juan.  He was killed  on his own hacienda  by a band of riflemen and  bolomen;  his head was cut off, wrapped in  a sack, and suspended from a bridge in the pueblo of Silay, and on it  was inscribed "Juan Carballo, hombre pernicioso a la revolucion."</p>
<p>It was held that the defendant was  pardoned by virtue of the proclamation.</p>
<p>In  the Guzman case  (1 Off.  Gaz., 380)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> the conviction was for murdering one Bonifacio, who was suspected of being a spy of the Spaniards.  He was apprehended and taken  before  Guzman, who interrogated him,  brutally assaulted him, and then directed that he be  taken to a near-by cemetery,  where he  was killed.  Guzman claimed lie acted under  orders of his superior in command.   He received the benefits  of the  proclamation and  was set at liberty. In the case of Candido Repollo (1 Off. Gaz.,  435),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> who killed  one Vallesteros with bolos and dragged his body along the highway because  one of the insurgents said he was a spy of the Americans  and had indicated  the barrios where the  insurrectos were located, defendant was  convicted and applied for pardon.</p>
<p>In  favoring the application  for  discharge,  under  the provisions  of  the proclamation,  the learned  judge who wrote the opinion stated that "there is a strong probability of the killing being of a political character, resulting from internal political feuds or dissensions among the Filipinos during the insurrection," and for this reason the application was granted.</p>
<p>The Lardizabal case (1 Off. Gaz., 183)1 shows an extraordinary case of cold-blooded murder and a  total disregard of the laws of war.  The defendant in that case, while in command of Filipino forces  operating  in  the Island  of Marinduque, being  hard pressed by the  United  States soldiers, ordered a retreat of his men.  He held an American soldier prisoner, who was sick and weak and unable to keep up with the insurgents in their retreat.  Lardizabal, fearing that  if the soldier were left behind he would give  information  of the whereabouts  of  the retreating forces, caused this unfortunate prisoner to be murdered.</p>
<p>It was held that, inasmuch as this crime was committed during the insurrection and was a measure, whether necessary  or not, inherent in the  military operations for the preservation of the troops commanded by  him,  the applicant  was entitled  to  the benefits  of  the  amnesty proclamation.</p>
<p>In the case of  Samson (1 Off. Gaz., 184)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> the defendant was charged  with a violation of section 9  of Act No. 292, in that he was concerned in prohibited secret meetings, and it was held that he was entitled to amnesty, as all violations of the whole of that act were covered by the proclamation.</p>
<p>In the Monton case (1 Off. Gaz., No. 2, p. 2)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> a Filipino named Afable was taken by insurrectos  to the mountains and an order was issued that  he be killed,  as he was said to be a spy of the Americans.   Six soldiers, including the defendant, after giving their victim time to  pray, decapitated the prisoner, cut open his stomach, cut out his heart and placed it in his stomach,  and cut out and  burned his tongue.  The defendant was  adjudged to  be entitled  to the benefit of the amnesty proclamation.</p>
<p>An extraordinary case, showing savagery,  hate, and revenge, was  that of Guzman et al.  (1 Off.  Gaz., No. 15, p. 4.)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></p>
<p>Lieut. Salvador Piera, of the Spanish army, was captured and held by the revolutionary forces.  While a prisoner he was sent from one post to another, from Aparri to llagan, by order of Simeon Villa, a major in the revolutionary army, who  stated that he desired the presence of the lieutenant in order to  have him make a  deposition. This transfer was made at the instigation of the defendant, Guzman, in order that he might take revenge on the lieutenant, who was a judge in  a military prosecution against Guzman in 1897.  On  the  arrival of the lieutenant  the defendants attacked him with guns, tied his arms behind his back, hung him from the  roof of the parochial residence, and from time to time let  him fall to the ground until death came to his relief.</p>
<p><em>Held</em>, defendants were entitled to be set at liberty, pursuant to the provisions of the amnesty proclamation. In the Carmona case (1 Off. Gaz., No. 17, p.  3)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> the defendant was charged with assassination.  As a captain in the insurrecto forces he issued an order to four soldiers to lie in wait for a tailor named Bias, in the district of Malate, Manila, and to arrest him, as he was said to be a spy of the Americans.</p>
<p>These soldiers waited at a designated place until Bias, accompanied by his  wife and another person,  passed  by, when they accosted  him, telling him that  their  superior officer, the defendant,  wanted to have his measure taken for a suit of clothes.  Bias said it was too late and refused to go, whereupon two of the soldiers threw themselves upon him, stabbed him to death, and left his body in the roadway.</p>
<p>The court held that this crime was covered by the proclamation.  In the Villamor case (1 Off. Gaz., No. 17, p. 5)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> the defendant acted as secretary to a council of insurrectos which determined that one Dumasal, having bought cows  for the  Americans, was therefore a  traitor  to  his country.  He was seized and executed.</p>
<p>It was held that this execution was an offense of a political character and that the  defendant was entitled to  the benefits of the pardon.</p>
<p>In the case of Ortiz et al.  (1 Off. Gaz., 451 )<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> the defendants  were charged with  the  murder  of  one Mariano  de Maza.  The victim was tied to a telegraph pole and could not defend himself, while he  was slashed with knives  on the head, chin, and side until he died.</p>
<p>The defendants claimed amnesty, and received it, on the ground that they acted under  orders of Major Reus, of the insurgent troops.   Inasmuch as it did not appear that the crime was due to any personal resentment, but simply to the belief that Maza  was a spy of the Americans and  an enemy of the  revolution,  it was held that the defendants were entitled to the benefits of  the amnesty proclamation.</p>
<p>In  the case of Colocar et  al. (1 Off.  Gaz., 453) <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>1  the defendant, Colocar, was an officer in  the insurrectionary movement in  Mindoro.  He killed one Finohermoso, who was regarded  as a spy of the  Americans.   The defendant claimed that he received orders from Major Cayton, of the insurgent forces, directing him to execute Finohermoso.</p>
<p>The court, considering the offense a political one, it appearing that there could have  been no other motive for the killing, held  that the defendant's case came  within the rules  of the amnesty  proclamation.</p>
<p>In  the  case of Berry,  decided by this court July 24, 1903,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> the  Solicitor-General  and the Attorney-General joined in a petition asking that the defendant be included in the amnesty.</p>
<p>The defendant  was participating  against the  United States in the insurrection in December, 1900, and claimed that he had been ordered by his chief to kill <em>all</em> spies of the Americans.</p>
<p>The defendant and the deceased met on the highway and got into an altercation which  resulted in the drawing  of knives and in  the killing in question.   The defendant contended that he killed  this man because he considered him a spy of the Americans.</p>
<p>This court held that, although the evidence was conflicting and not entirely satisfactory, the story of the defendant was probably true, and accordingly granted the prayer of the petitioner.</p>
<p>In the case  of Pacheco et al., decided July 24, 1903,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> it appeared that an old man and a boy left their home to go to Dagupan in April, 1900, to sell books from which the natives could learn English.  On the way they were attacked by ten men, including the defendant Pacheco, who ordered the old man to be taken into a wood, where he was killed.  On the return of the band  Pacheco  ordered the boy to be stabbed, and this was done and his  body was thrown into a river.  It appears that while  in the river the boy showed signs of life and he was again stabbed until he died.  Two of the defendants were convicted of murder and asked  for  amnesty  under the proclamation.  At the trial they denied their guilt and that they were insurgents. Now they introduce evidence to show that they were insurgents, and that the man and boy were killed because they were spies  of the  Americans.  <em>Held</em>, entitled to amnesty under the proclamation.</p>
<p>An examination of all these cases, and of the decisions of this  court, leads to  the  conclusion that  the amnesty proclamation has been and should be liberally construed with a view of bringing about peace, order, and good  will. It is to be borne in mind that during the trying and turbulent times  when the revolution  was on  against Spanish power, later when the soldiers of the United States and armed Filipinos united  to overthrow Spanish arms, and finally when the insurrectos defied and attempted to overthrow the lawful authority of the United States in  these Islands,  and when mandates of courts  could not be enforced, many crimes of a heinous nature were committed—crimes that were revolting in the eyes  of a  law-abiding people—and the criminals could not be apprehended or punished because "<em>inter arma silent leges</em>"</p>
<p>The crime with which the defendant in the case at bar is charged was committed  by a band  of soldiers.  The defendant himself was on good terms with the husband of the woman  for the imprisonment of whom he was  convicted and had no ill feeling against her.  Evidently this  body of soldiers was out plundering  and gathering  in objectionable prisoners—a not uncommon occurrence in revolutionary  times.  One of the witnesses in  this case was a prisoner  of the same armed body and at the same time. Nor were such crimes unusual in the  struggles in these Islands.  In a proclamation which  General MacArthur issued in December, 1900, protesting against the frequent violation of the laws of war by the insurrectos, and threatening  severe punishment for  the  same,  he enumerated, among such violations, the  kidnaping  and assassinating of residents of occupied towns, and stated that mandates had been issued  by the insurgent officers directing that such violations should be carried on.</p>
<p>It may be said that the offense charged here is  not an offense of a political  character, but rather one having for its object private  plunder.   A crime of a political character has been defined to be one which "is incidental to and forms a part of political disturbances."</p>
In view of the fact that for many years political disturbances  were quite prevalent and  quite violent in these Islands; that in furtherance of the views of one party or the other organized and unorganized bands roved about killing and plundering and  confiscating  (for when such men needed meat or drink or clothing or money they took, as is usual in  such cases, what was nearest to hand or most easily obtained),  and  did all this as an incident to and part of the insurrection.  The facts  and circumstances of this case justify the reasonable presumption that the band of armed, men in question, including the  defendant, acted under orders, especially when the  statement of General MacArthur that such orders were issued is given consideration.  Actual, legal  proof that the offenses were political in their  character has not been required in other cases.   It has been held sufficient if the defendants <em>claimed</em> that their  motives  were political.  For instance,  in the numerous cases where men were killed  because they were supposed to be spies, there  was in no one of these cases actual  and legal  proof that the victim  was a spy  of the Americans.  The  mere say-so of some one was  held to be sufficient when followed by an order to kill.   As an example let us take the Berry case above.  The excuse given by the  defendant  was  that he was ordered to kill <em>all</em> spies, that he considered his victim a spy and therefore he killed him, and claimed amnesty  and received  it.  Under this same order to kill all spies  he might have killed every man, woman, and child he met on the highway and claimed immunity on  the  ground that  he  heard they  were spies and he killed  them for that reason.   Under such a liberal construction it would seem that  in the case  at bar the defendant Luzon, who is not charged with murder, but  with illegal detention  and robbery, should have the benefit of the proclamation.<br>
