				G.R. No. 2888, October 23, 1906</h4>
				<H3>HUNG-MAN-YOC, IN THE NAME OF KWONG-WO-SING, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. KIENG-CHIONG-SENG ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The court below entered judgment against each and all of the defendants, Chua-Che-Co,  Yu-Yec-Pin,  and Ang-Chu-Keng for the sum of 7,962.14 pesos, Mexican, equivalent to 7,372.75 pesos, Philippine currency, with interest at the rate of  6  per cent per annum from December 7, 1903, and costs.</p>
<p>Chua-Che-Co is the only one who appealed. The court  below found that Chua-Che-Co, Yu-Yec-Pin, and  Ang-Chu-Keng were  partners of  Kiong-Tiao-Eng, under the firm name of Kieng-Chiong-Seng.</p>
<p>It has not been proved that Kieng-Chiong-Seng was the firm name, but rather the designation of the partnership.</p>
<p>It can not be the firm name of a general partnership because this should contain the names of all the partners, or some of them, or at least one of them to be, followed in the two latter cases by the words "and company" (art.  126 of the Code of Commerce),  whereas in  this case none of the four names of those who it is alleged were members of the firm appear  in the firm name of the partnership. Neither can it be considered as the firm name of a limited partnership for the  reason  that this should contain  the same  requisites as the firm name of a general partnership, and in addition thereto the word "limited."  (Art. 146.) The firm name in question  has absolutely none of these requisites.</p>
<p>Anonymous partnerships (corporations) do not require a firm name or  signature; a  designation adequate, for  the object or objects of the business to which it is dedicated, is sufficient.   (Arts. 151 and 152.)</p>
<p>The fact is, as alleged by  the plaintiff and appellee in his brief, that "there is no doubt that the partnership of Kieng-Chiong-Seng was  a mercantile partnership organized for the purpose of engaging in commercial pursuits, although such organization was  not evidenced  by any public document as required by article 119 of the  Code of Commerce, nor was it  registered as required by article 17 of the said code" (p. 5).</p>
<p>All these statements are correct.</p>
<p>The partnership in question was a  mercantile one, as it was engaged in the importation of goods for sale here at a profit.  It was so testified to by its manager, Yu-Yec-Pin, and Kiong-Tiao-Eng.  But  its organization is not  evidenced by any public  document.  The agent Yu-Yec-Pin himself and  some of  his so-called, partners have merely noted in the books of  the partnership, which by the way, were not introduced in  evidence, the capital which each had contributed.   The agent  further testified that the partnership was not recorded in the Mercantile Registry but in the Internal Revenue office.</p>
<p>All this being so, the alleged partnership never had any legal existence nor has it acquired any juridical personality in  the acts and contracts  executed and made  by it (Art. 116, par. 2.)</p>
<p>But as the said partneship was a partnership<em> de  facto</em>, although it had no legal standing, and contracted obligations in favor of the plaintiff, the liability arising from such obligation must be enforcible Against some one.</p>
<p>The partnership in question not being included in any of the classes of  partnership defined by the Code of  Commerce  there should be  applied to it the general provisions applicable to all partnerships contained in  article 120 of the Code of Commerce, which  reads  as  follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The persons in charge of the  management of the association who do not  comply with the provisions of  the foregoing article  (art. 119,  which requires that  the  articles of partnership be recorded in a public instrument, and  that the partnership be registered in the Mercantile Register) shall be responsible  together with the  persons hot members of the association  with whom they may have transacted business in  the name of the same."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The defendant,  Chua-Che-Co, was not in charge of the management of the association, nor did he make any contract at all with the plaintiff, as clearly appears from the testimony of the various witnesses, the agent of the partnership, Yu-Yec-Pin, being the person  who  made all the contracts for the partnership; also Kieng-Tiao-Eng according to two of the witnesses.   It is evident, therefore, that he has  incurred no liability and  that he can not be held individually responsible for  the payment  of  plaintiff's claims, as the court below found.</p>
<p>We accordingly  reverse the judgment of the court below and acquit the defendant, Chua-Che-Co,  without special condemnation as to costs in both instances.</p>
<p>After the  expiration of ten days  from the date of final judgment  the  record will be remanded to  the Court of First Instance  for execution.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres,  Mapa, Johnson, Carson,  Willard,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
