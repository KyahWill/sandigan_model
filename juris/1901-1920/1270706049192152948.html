				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Defendant-appellant in this case was charged with the crime&nbsp; of falsification of a&nbsp; public&nbsp; document by a public official; convicted of the crime of reckless negligence&nbsp; (<i>imprudencia temeraria</i>) in the falsification of a public document by a&nbsp; public official; and sentenced&nbsp; to&nbsp; four months and one day of<i> arresto mayor</i>, with the accessory penalties prescribed by the code.<br><br>Under the doctrine laid down in the case of Weems <i>vs.</i> U. S.&nbsp; (217 U. S., 349), and in the opinion of&nbsp; this court deciding the motion&nbsp; of appellant in the case of U. S. <i>vs.</i> Pico,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> register No.&nbsp; 5487, dated the&nbsp; 11th day of&nbsp; February, 1911, the court below was without jurisdiction&nbsp; to impose the&nbsp; penalty prescribed by the code for&nbsp; the&nbsp; offense&nbsp; with which&nbsp; defendant-appellant was charged, that penalty being in repugnance to the provision of the Philippine Bill&nbsp; of Rights which prohibits the infliction of cruel and unusual punishments.<br><br>As a necessary corollary of the doctrine laid down in that case, the court below was also without jurisdiction to impose any&nbsp; penalty whatever upon the defendant-appellant for the crime&nbsp; of reckless&nbsp; negligence (<i>imprudencia temeraria</i>)&nbsp; in the falsification of a public document, since the only penalties prescribed by law for reckless negligence (<i>imprudencia temeraria</i>) are to be found in article 568 of the Penal Code, and&nbsp; the penalties therein prescribed are made to depend upon the penalty prescribed for the commission of the acts with malice which are penalized in this article of the&nbsp; code when committed without malice but with reckless negligence. No lawful penalty being prescribed by the code for the falsification of&nbsp; a&nbsp; public document by a public&nbsp; official, there is nothing&nbsp; in&nbsp; article&nbsp; 568&nbsp; defining&nbsp; and penalizing reckless negligence&nbsp; (<i>imprudencia temeraria</i>)&nbsp; which authorizes the imposition of a penalty for reckless negligence in the falsification of a public document by a public official.<br><br>The&nbsp; sentence of the trial court should, therefore, be reversed, and&nbsp; the&nbsp; information filed in this case together with all the proceedings based thereon should be dismissed with the costs of both instances <span style="font-style: italic;">de oficio.</span>&nbsp; The defendant-appellant, if in detention, should be set at liberty forthwith, or if at large on bail, should have his bond exonerated.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano, C.
