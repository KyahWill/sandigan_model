				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On the 27th of August,  1906,  a complaint was filed by the provincial fiscal of  Surigao with the district  court accusing Ildefonso  Rodriguez of the  crime of parricide, in that, on the morning of Thursday,  March 8 of said year, he  did intentionally,  and with premeditation, kill  his father,  Florentine) Rodriguez, at the  latter's  own  house, and without any  provocation on the part of the deceased.</p>
<p>Proceedings having been instituted by  reason  of  the foregoing complaint, the court, in view of the conclusions, entered judgment therein on  the  26th  of November, 1906, and sentenced the accused  to the  penalty of life imprisonment and  the accessories thereof, to  indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P1,000 and to pay the costs. From the judgment the accused has appealed.</p>
<p>From the testimony of several  witnesses  in this case, it appears  that on  the morning of March 7  of said year, during  a conversation  had by the accused  with  Tomas Gereda at the house of Doming^ Eslava, the former stated that if his father, Florentino Rodriguez, ever scolded him, he was prepared to oppose and resist him because his father had  burned his clothes; the owner of the house was not present at the time.   Although the accused lived with his father and stepmother, Gregoria Lantoria,  he did not spend the night of the 7th in their company, but slept at the house of the said Dominga Eslava.  On  the morning  of the 8th, for the reason that the accused had  not summoned the laborers as his father had directed, he and his stepmother were scolded by the father,  and the accused, Ildefonso, was ordered to leave the house, which he at once did, but shortly thereafter he returned to  the house of his father  armed with a bolo with which he immediately assaulted the same, and  as the stepmother, Lantoria, tried to interfere, the accused threatened to  kill her if she did  not leave the house; she therefore,  through fear, left the house at once while the accused and his father were engaged in a furious struggle.</p>
<p>A  few moments afterwards, while the stepmother, Gregoria Lantoria, was at the house of Inocencio Nabalo, where she  had  gone  after leaving the house of  the deceased, the accused  made his appearance and upon being questioned as to what he had done to his father, lie replied that he had tied him up in the shape of a figure eight, and that a dried fish would have a  better chance  to live than his father; these statements were heard by Nabalo, the owner of the house, and he further added that he had heard the accused say, in  the presence of the witness  Mauricio Iligan, that he had  killed his father a short time previously  by strangling  him with his hands, and that he  refused to pardon his father because  the latter also  declined to forgive him, and for the further reason that his father had burned his clothes, a fact which  he  considered as if  he himself had  been burned; this is confirmed  by Iligan. Shortly before  the crime was committed Basilia Bitancol and  Maria Cruces saw, from the  house of Dominga Eslava, that the accused had  gone down, and, as they were unable to stop him, he went in the  direction of his father's house and  immediately after he had gone  upstairs they heard the father ask for forgiveness and call for assistance, and subsequently the accused appeared at the house of Maria Cruces, asking for his washed clothes, and they then saw blood stains on one of the shoulders of his coat.  Maria Lastima and Eustaquio Silos also testify to having heard the victim call for assistance  from his own house from which the accused  descended shortly after.</p>
<p>In  the evening of the day when the affray occurred the accused requested Marcelino Ebor, Severino Legaspi, and Andres Bitancol, residents of the barrio, to take the body of his father to the pueblo to be buried, and, when in the house where the  crime was committed, they saw that the deceased had a small wound in  the right hand and another in the left temple,  that the neck was discolored, and that the body was lying face downwards on the floor, on which they noticed stains of blood; the aforesaid witnesses, Silos and Lastima, testify that prior to the occurrence they saw the deceased burn the clothes of the accused.</p>
<p>The criminal act resulting  from  the statements contained in this case is fully proven by the testimony of competent witnesses,  and from conclusions derived from other facts  also proven, and because of the relationship existing between the accused and his victim, the crime committed is that of parricide, denned by and punished under article 402 of the Penal Code which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"He who shall kill his  father, mother,  *  *  *  shall be punished  as a parricide, with the penalty of <em>cadena perpetua </em>to death."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The accused, Ildefonso Rodriguez, pleaded not guilty. The facts in  the case, however, and  the  incriminating details offered therein, taken as a  whole and viewed according to the principles of sound criticism and common sense, produce in the mind a full certainty of the guilt of the accused as the only proven author of the violent death of his father, Florentino Rodriguez; his unjustified allegation that  his  father died in consequence  of  illness  contracted on the day previous to his  death is inadmissible, because, far from said allegation being  confirmed, it has been denied by Hilaria Lastima, and by Gregoria Lantoria, the wife of the deceased, who both state that he was infcgood health and that he was not suffering from any malady up to the time when he was violently killed.</p>
<p>The above-named wife of the deceased was present at the latter's house when the accused entered carrying a bolo in his hand and assaulted his father with the same, and also at  the time when the furious  struggle ensued between father and son wjierein she could not interfere because the accused,  under threat of  death, ordered her to  leave the house.  The fact that cries for help and the prayer for pardon from the deceased to his  assailant, the accused, were heard by some  neighbors shortly after; the fact that when the accused appeared  at the house of  Inocencio Nabalo where his stepmother,  Gregoria Lantoria, had taken refuge, and that upon being questioned by her as to what he had done to his father, he replied that he had tied him up and that a dried fish would have a better chance to live than  his  unfortunate father; the fact that the accused affirmed  in the presence of  said Nabalo and of  Mauricio Iligan that he had killed his father by strangling him with his hands, and also  told  Tomas Gereda, on the morning of the 7th of March, the  day before the occurrence, that he  was prepared to  resist  his father in case the latter scolded him, for the reason that the father had burned the clothes of the accused; the  fact that the accused appeared at the house of Maria Cruces Avith blood stains on one of the shoulders of the coat he then Avore, and asked for  washed clothes shortly  after the occurrence, and the fact that the body of the deceased was  found lying face downwards on the floor, of the house, with a small wound in  the  right hand  and another in the left temple, the front part of his throat being discolored, the floor of the house being stained with  blood,  all according to the  testimony  of  the  three individuals who were summoned by the accused  for the burial of the body, all of which facts were closely related, and considering the uncontradicted testimony of the above-named witnesses, the culpability of Ildefonso Rodriguez as the slayer of his unfortunate father, Florentino Rodriguez, is proven beyond a doubt.</p>
<p>In the commission of the crime there were no  aggravating circumstances and paragraph  20 of  article  10 of the code can not be considered because the accused lived in the same house as his father, and it has not been shown that he had his own and independent dwelling, and according to the well-established precedents of courts it is not proper to consider  such circumstance  when the house wherein the crime was committed is the dwelling of  both the offender and  of  the  injured party.  The proven fact that, on the day before the occurrence, the deceased burned the clothes of the accused, and the dismissal of the latter from his house shortly before the assault  because he did not fulfill an order given him by the deceased might, perhaps, be  considered as a mitigating circumstance, as he was prompted to act under loss of self-control and without the respect and regard due to his father; for this reason, the penalty in its minimum grade would apply in this case. However, whether or  not the said circumstance, which is the seventh of article 9 of the code, be considered, because no aggravating circumstance was present, it is only proper to impose on the accused the lower of the  two indivisible penalties prescribed by  said  article  402,  in accordance with rules 2  and 3 of article 80 of the Penal Code.</p>
<p>Therefore, in view  of the foregoing and accepting the conclusions of  the court below as stated in the judgment appealed from, the same should be affirmed, provided that the accessories 2 and 3 of article 54 of the Penal Code shall be  imposed  and that the indemnity shall be paid to the widow and  other heirs of the deceased, with the costs against the accused.  So ordered.</p>
