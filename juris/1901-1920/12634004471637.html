				<H3>THE MUNICIPALITY OF OAS, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE,  VS. BARTOLOME ROA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.

				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The  plaintiff brought this action  for the recovery of  a tract of land in the pueblo of Oas, claiming that it was a part of the public square of said  town.   The defendant in his answer  alleged that he was the owner of the property. Judgment  was  rendered in  favor of the plaintiff and  the defendant has brought the case here by bill of exceptions.</p>
<p>As we look at  the case,  the only  question involved is one  of fact.   Was the property  in question a part of  the public  square of the town of Gas?  The testimony upon 
  this point in  favor of the plaintiff consisted of statements
  made by  witnesses to the effect that this land had always
  been a  part of the public square, and of certain resolutions
  adopted by the <em>principalia</em> of the  pueblo reciting the same
  fact, the  most important of these  being the minutes of the
  meeting of the 27th of February, 1892.   In that document
  it is expressly stated that this land was bought in 1832 by
  the then parish  priest for the benefit  of the pueblo.  It
  recites  various proceedings taken  thereafter in connection
  with this ownership, including among them an order of the
  <em>corregidor</em> of Nueva Caceres  prohibiting the erection of
houses  upon the land by reason of the fact above recitedâ€”namely, that the land belonged to  the pueblo.  This resolution terminated with an order to the occupant of the building the standing upon the property that he should not repair it. The defendant signed this resolution.</p>
<p>It further appears  that  the same building  was almost entirely destroyed by a <em>baguio</em> on the 13th and 14th of May, 1893, and that the authorities  of  the pueblo ordered the complete demolition thereof.  The resolution  of  the 31st of May, 1893, declared that the then owner of the building, Jose Castillo, had no right to reconstruct it because it was situated upon land which did  not belong to him.  This resolution was also signed by the defendant.</p>
<p>The evidence on  the part of the defendant tends to show that in 1876 Juana Riarte and Juana Riquiza sold the land in question to Juan  Roco, and that on the 17th day of December, 1894, Jose Castillo sold it to the defendant.  No deed of conveyance from Juan  Roco to Jose Castillo was presented in evidence, but  Castillo, testifying as a witness, said that he had  bought the property by verbal  contract from Roco,  his father-in-law.   The defendant, after his purchase in 1894, procured a possesory information which was allowed by an order of the justice of the peace of Oas on  the 19th day  of January,  1895, and recorded in the Registry of Property  on the 28th of March of the  same year.</p>
<p>In this state of the evidence, we can not say  that the proof is plainly and  manifestly against the  decision of the court below. Unless it is so, the finding of face made by that court can not be reversed. (De la Rama vs. De la Rama, 201 U.S., 303)</p>
<p>The two statements signed by Roa, one in 1892 and the other in 1893, are competent evidence against him. They are admissions by him to the effect that at that time the pueblo was the owner of the property in question. They are, of course, not conclusive against him. He was entitled to, and did present evidence to overcome the effect of these admissions. The evidence does not make out a case of estoppel against him. (Sec. 333, par. 1, Code of Civil Procedure.)</p>
<p>The admissibility of these statements made by Roa do not rest upon section 278 of the Code Civil Procedure, which relates to declarations or admissions made by persons not a party to the suit has himself made an admission of any face pertinent to the issue involved, it can be received against him.</p>
<p>This action was commenced on the 17th of  December, 1902.  There is no evidence of any adverse occupation of this land for thirty years, consequently the extraordinary period of prescription does not apply.   The defendant can not  rely upon the  ordinary  period  of prescription of ten years  because  he was  not a holder  in  good faith.  He knew at the time of his purchase in 1894, and had so stated in writing, that the pueblo was the owner of the property. So  that, even if the  statute of  limitations ran against a municipality in reference to a public square, it could not avail the defendant; in this case.</p>
<p>It appears that Roa has constructed upon the property, and  that there now stands thereon, a substantial building. As early as 1852 this  land had been used by the municipality for other purposes than that of a public square.  It had constructed thereon buildings for the  storage of property of the State,  quarters for the <em>cuadrilleros</em>, and others of a like  character.  It therefore had ceased to be property used by the  public and had become a part of the bievivs <em>patrimoniales</em> of the pueblo.   (Civil Code, arts.  341, 344.) To the case  are applicable those provisions of the Civil Code which relate to the construction by one person of a building upon land belonging to another.  Article 364 of the Civil Code is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"When there has been bad faith, not only on the part of the person  who built, sowed, or planted on another's land, but also on the part  of the owner of the latter, the rights of both shall  be the same as if they had acted in good faith.</p>
  <p>"Bad faith on the part of the owner is understood whenever the act has been executed in  his  presence  with his knowledge  and tolerance and  without objection."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The defendant constructed the building in bad faith for, as we have said, he  had  knowledge of the fact,  that his grantor was not the  owner thereof.  There was bad faith also on the part of  the plaintiff in accordance  with the express provisions of article 304 since  it allowed Roa to construct the building without any opposition on its part and to  so  occupy it  for eight years.   The rights  of the parties must, therefore, be determined as if they both had acted in good faith.   Their rights in such cases are governed by article 361 of the Civil  Code, which is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The  owner of the land on which building, sowing, or planting is done in good faith shall have a right to appropriate as his own the work, sowing, or  planting after the indemnity mentioned in articles 453 and 454, or, to oblige the person  who  has  built or  planted, to pay to him the value of the land and to force the person who sowed to pay the proper rent."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The judgment of the court below is so modified as to declare that the plaintiff is the owner of the land  and that it has the option of buying the building thereon,  which is the property of the defendant,  or of selling to him the land on which it stands.   The plaintiff is entitled to recover the costs of both instances.</p>
<p>After the expiration of twenty days let judgment be entered  in  accordance herewith and  at the  proper time thereafter let the record  be remanded to the  court below for proper  action.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Johnson, Carson,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ., </em>concur.<br>
