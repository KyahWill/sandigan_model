				<BR><STRONG>MORELAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for a writ of certiorari directed to the Court of First 
Instance of the city of Manila for a review of a judgment of conviction in a 
criminal action entered by that court against the petitioners herein.
<p>It appears that the petitioners were arrested and convicted in the municipal 
court of the city of Manila for having engaged in a gambling game within the 
police jurisdiction of the city of Manila. They appealed to the Court of First 
Instance of the city of Manila. The case having been properly certified to the 
appellate court a demurrer was filed to the information upon the same grounds 
presented as the basis of the demurrer in the municipal court, namely, that the 
municipal court had no jurisdiction of the crime and that, as a consequence, the 
Court of First Instance had no jurisdiction thereof on appeal. The demurrer was 
overruled and the case tried, resulting in a conviction and a fine of P100 
against each of the petitioners. An appeal was thereupon taken to the Supreme 
Court, which appeal was denied by the Court of First Instance.</p>
<p>The basis of the petition in this case is, as already indicated, the alleged 
lack of jurisdiction of the municipal court of the city of Manila, it being 
claimed that, the information having been filed under Act No. 1757, known as the 
Gambling Law, and that Act permitting a punishment of more than six months 
imprisonment and P200 fine, the municipal court had no jurisdiction thereof and 
all proceedings in that court and subsequent thereto have neither force nor 
effect.</p>
<p>The argument in support of this contention is based on the Act of Congress of 
July 1, 1902, which confirms the jurisdiction of certain courts of the 
Philippine Islands as then exercised; and that the jurisdiction of the municipal 
court of the city of Manila at the time of the passage of the Act of Congress 
referred to being limited as aforesaid, such jurisdiction was confirmed by that 
Act as thus limited and could not thereafter be enlarged.</p>
<p>This argument overlooks an important point; and that is, that at the time 
said Act of Congress was passed, the municipal court of the city of Manila was 
enjoying the jurisdiction conferred by Act No. 267 and not that conferred by Act 
136 upon which the petitioners rely as showing the jurisdiction of that court at 
that time. Act No. 267 gives the municipal court of the city of Manila 
concurrent jurisdiction with the Court of First Instance over all violations of 
the Gambling Law committed within its territorial limits.</p>
<p>This being the case the contention of the petitioners is without grounds to 
sustain it.</p>
<p>The petition is dismissed, with costs. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Carson, Trent</em>, and <em>Araullo, JJ.</em>, concur.</p></div>
