				<BR><STRONG>MAPA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>In an action between the plaintiff and  the defendant herein judgment was rendered in the court below on the 11th of December, 1903, the adjudging part of which is as follows: "It. is  ordered that the defendant  (the  accused in these proceedings)  abstain from manufacturing canes and  umbrellas with a curved handle by means of a lamp or blowpipe fed with mineral oil or petroleum, which process was  protected  by patent No.  19228,  issued in favor  of Henry Gsell, and by him transferred to Carlos Gsell."   In the  month of February, 1904, the  plaintiff presented a petition  alleging that "on the 8th of tlie said month, and some time prior to that date, the defendant in disobedience of the aforesaid judgment, and in violation of the same, was  and is now engaged in the unlawful manufacture  of umbrella handles by the identical process described in and protected by said patent No.  19228, or a process so like the patent process as to be indistinguishable," and accordingly asked  the  court to punish the accused for contempt and  to order the latter to indemnify the plaintiff as damages in the sum of $1,000, United States currency, and  to pay the costs.</p>
<p>The parties having appeared in open court and stipulated that  "the defendant had used, and was  still using, as a process for curving canes and umbrella handles, the same process  described in the memoir  which accompanied the patent, with the exception that he has substituted for an oil an alcohol-burning lamp."</p>
<p>The court considering that  the plaintiff  had only the exclusive right to the use of the <em>coal or mineral</em> oil-burning lamp, held that the defendant was not guilty of contempt, to which  decision of the court the plaintiff duly excepted.</p>
<p>Patent No. 19228, referred to in the judgment of the 11th of December, 1903, does not appear in the  bill of exceptions.  Since these are contempt proceedings  for the disobedience of said judgment, we should have before us the patent in order to determine whether there was any actual disobedience of the order of the court.   It is evident that the accused had not committed any direct violation, plain and manifest, of the prohibition imposed upon him in the judgment.  The violation, if there has been  any, was not of such a character that it  epuld be made patent by the mere enunciation of the acts performed by the defendant, which are alleged to constitute the said violation.  These acts were not clearly and manifestly contrary to the precise terms of  the prohibition.  According, to the express language of the judgment, the prohibition is against the manufacture of canes and umbrellas  with curved  handles  by means of  the use of a coal or mineral oil-burning lamp or blowpipe, and the parties have stipulated that  the defendant did not use a coal or mineral oil-burning lamp, but an alcohol-burning lamp.</p>
<p>The question, however, arises as to whether  that prohibition included the substitution  of  alcohol for  coal  or mineral oil.  In more abstract and general terms, the appellant  propounds  this question  in his brief as follows: "The question presented by this appeal is whether or  not the use of a patented process by a third person, without license or authority therefor, constitutes an  infringement when the  alleged infringer has substituted in lieu of some <em>unessential part </em>of the patented  process a <em>well-known mechanical equivalent."</em>  It is seen that by its  very terms this question implies in the present case the existence of two fundamental facts which must first be duly established, viz: (1)  That the use of the lamp fed with petroleum or mineral oil was an  unessential part of the patented process the use of which  by the accused  was prohibited by the said judgment; and (2) that alcohol is an equivalent and proper substitute, well known as such, for mineral oil or petroleum in connection with the said process.  The appellant  has failed to affirmatively establish either of these two essential facts,  lie has  merely assumed  their existence, without proving the same, thus begging the whole question.  Consequently the  contempt with which the accused is charged has not been fully and satisfactorily  proved, and  the  order appealed from should accordingly be affirmed in so far as it holds that the defendant is not guilty of contempt. Having reached  this conclusion, it  is  unnecessary  for us to pass upon plaintiff's prayer for a preliminary injunction,  as the same is based upon the alleged infringement of the patent upon  which these proceedings for contempt were based.</p>
<p>The  order of  the court  below is hereby affirmed,  with the costs of this  instance against the appellant.  After  the expiration of twenty days let judgment be entered in  accordance herewith, and  ten days thereafter  the case be remanded to the court below for execution.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C, J., Torres, Carson, Willard,</em> and<em> Tracey, JJ., </em>concur.</p>
