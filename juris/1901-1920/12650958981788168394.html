				<H3>RAMON MEDINA ONG-QUINGCO, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. CECILIO IMAZ, ADMINISTRATOR OF THE ESTATE OF THE DECEASED SALUSTIANO ZUBELDIA, AND WARNER, BARNES & CO., LIMITED, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MORELAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of the 
Province of Albay in favor of the defendants and against the plaintiff in an 
action of ejectment.
<p>The facts in the case are substantially undisputed. It appears that in 
January, 1906, Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., Limited, the owner 'in fee simple of a 
tract of land in the town of Albay, part of which is in dispute in this action, 
began proceedings in the Court of Land Registration for the registration of its 
title thereto under the provisions of Act No. 496. In June, 1906, said company 
sold a portion of the land thus undergoing registration to Salustiano Zubeldia, 
whose estate is represented by the defendant Cecilio Imaz as administrator. By 
an oversight, however, said company failed to amend the proceedings before the 
Court of Land Registration so as to exclude from the land described therein that 
portion thereof which it had sold to Zubeldia.</p>
<p>Immediately after the sale Zubeldia entered into posession of the land in 
question, made improvements thereon, and erected a stone wall along the dividing 
line between the lot sold to him and the rest of the property retained by 
Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., Limited, undergoing registration as aforesaid. The 
fact that Zubeldia had been in actual possession of the property in question 
from the time of its sale to him down to the time of his death, which occurred 
during the pendency of this action, was known to the plaintiff.</p>
<p>About three years after the sale to Zubeldia the Court of Land Registration, 
in the proceeding hereinbefore referred to, entered a decree in favor of Warner, 
Barnes &amp; Co., Limited, registering its title to the tract of land described 
in the application, including therein the land sold to Zubeldia, the fact of the 
sale to him, as we have already said, having been overlooked by the parties to 
said proceeding.</p>
<p>In July, 1911, G, M. Laing, the agent of Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., Limited, 
in Albay, acting in behalf of the company, agreed, by a proper instrument in 
writing, to sell to the plaintiff in this case, for the sum of P3,000, <em>the 
remainder of the tract of land from which Zubeldia's lot had been sold.</em> 
That this was the land actually sold and no other is certain. Laing testified 
that before executing the contract of sale to the plaintiff he took him 
personally to inspect the land which he was buying and pointed out the 
boundaries thereof; that at that time the land sold to Zubeldia some four years 
before was entirely cut off from the rest of the land by a stone wall. Laing 
pointed out the wall as being the limit of the land under consideration, saying, 
"I took him there and showed him the walls, advising him that the part we 
desired to sell him was all that contained within the walls on the 
land."<br><br>A short time after the execution by Lamg of the contract with the 
plaintiff, Juan T, Figueras, manager of Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., Limited, arid 
in representation of said company, executed a conveyance of the land in question 
to the plaintiff, taking the description of the land set out in the conveyance 
from the description of the property <em>as registered in the Court of Land 
Registration.</em> On account of the fact, however, that the sale to Zubeldia 
had been overlooked in the proceedings for the registration of title, the 
description in the conveyance executed by Figueras on behalf of the company 
included not only the land sold to plaintiff <em>but also the land sold four 
years before to Zubeldia.</em> Plaintiff's conveyance was duly delivered to him 
and, upon its presentation to the registrar of deeds of Albay, a certificate of 
title was issued to him under the provisions of Act No. 496.</p>
<p>In November 1911 plaintiff made a demand upon Zubeldia for the possession of 
the property then occupied by him, the same being, as we have said, included in 
the description in the conveyance received by him from Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., 
Limited. The demand for possession having been refused, plaintiff commenced this 
action in December, 1911, against Zubeldia. The latter obtained an order of the 
Court of First Instance for the inclusion of Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., Limited, 
as a party defendant, and said company is the real defendant in the 
case.<br><br>The complaint alleges that the plaintiff is the owner of the land 
occupied by Zubeldia. The answer denies this and alleges that the inclusion of 
the Zubeldia lot in plaintiff's conveyance was due to a mutual mistake, and asks 
that the court make a correction of the record by the exclusion of the Zubeldia 
property from plaintiff's conveyance and the records thereof. The judgment of 
the court granted the relief prayed in the answer.</p>
<p>We have no doubt from the evidence in this case that the plaintiff knew, at 
the time the contract of the sale was executed, as well as when the conveyance 
was made, that Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., Limited, did not intend to sell him the 
land which it had already sold to Zubeldia about four years before; and that his 
purchase was restricted to the land adjoining that sold to Zubeldia and 
separated therefrom by a stone wall which, in large part, inclosed the lands 
sold to and then occupied by Zubeldia.</p>
<p>The plaintiff relies for a reversal of the judgment upon the proposition that 
a Torrens title is absolutely indefeasible and that as he has a certificate of 
title showing from the description therein that he is the owner of the lands 
occupied by Zubeldia, such title cannot be successfully resisted by the 
defendants herein.</p>
<p>There might be some force in this declaration if the litigation were between 
the plaintiff and Zubeldia alone, and the plaintiff were an innocent purchaser 
for value. Undoubtedly, so far as an innocent purchaser for value is concerned, 
the decree of registration of the Court of Land Registration cut off the title 
of Zubeldia to the land in question and left him with naked possession alone. 
But, as between plaintiff and Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., Limited, he is not an 
innocent purchaser for value; indeed, he is not a purchaser at all. As we have 
said, it is substantially undisputed that Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., Limited, and 
the plaintiff agreed, the one to sell and the other to buy, a certain parcel of 
land, with definite boundaries, perfectly visible on inspection, which lands and 
the boundaries thereof were shown to the purchaser by the seller and were 
recognized and accepted by him as the boundaries of the land which he proposed 
to buy. In other words, the minds of the parties met upon the purchase and sale 
of a given, definite parcel of land. By a mistake, an oversight, there crept 
into the instrument by which it was sought to make the proposed sale effective a 
description which included not only the land which the parties had agreed upon 
as the subject matter of their contract but also an additional piece of land 
which was not within the contemplation of either party at the time the contract 
of sale was made. As between Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., Limited, and the 
plaintiff, therefore, the latter got nothing by reason of the mistake which the 
company made in the description of the land sold. Immediately on discovering the 
error Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., Limited, could have brought an action to correct 
the conveyance and make it represent the real intention of the parties. As 
between them no question as to the indefensibility of a Torrens title could 
arise. Such an action could have been maintained at any time while the property 
remained in the hands of the purchaser. The peculiar force of a Torrens title 
would have been brought into play only when the purchaser had sold to an 
innocent third person for value the lands described in his conveyance. </p>
<p>Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., Limited, being a party to this action, and the land 
still remaining in the hands of the purchaser, the plaintiff herein, Warner, 
Barnes &amp; Co., Limited, may, on behalf of Zubeldia, or his successors in 
interest, exercise the same rights and pursue the same remedies which it could 
have exercised and pursued if it had been the plaintiff in an action to correct 
the description in the conveyance by which the property was transferred to the 
plaintiff. There having been a mutual mistake between Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., 
Limited, and the plaintiff in this case in the execution of the conveyance in 
question, that mistake can be corrected in the action before us, the defendant, 
Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., Limited, having presented in its answer facts 
sufficient for such affirmative relief and such relief having been prayed 
affirmatively therein. That is precisely what the learned trial court did, and 
we are of the opinion that it acted correctly.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the appellant.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C J., Carson</em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
