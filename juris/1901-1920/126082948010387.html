				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. WALTER B. BROWN, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Under a  complaint presented on September 15, 1906, Walter B. Brown was  accused  of the falsification of a private document—that is, of the <em>vale</em>, "Exhibit A," the original of which is attached to page 14 of the record and is of the following tenor:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Manila,  P. I.—Sept. 10,  '06.: <em>Vale</em> for P80  (Eighty Pesos, P. C.)—Payable on sight.—J. EL Taylor—Cos f Co."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the date above mentioned and in the city of'Manila, said Walter B. Brown, with intent to prejudice Walter E., Olsen &amp; Co., made, imitated, and falsified  said <em>vale</em>,  a document which appeared to be signed by J. H. Taylor for the sum of ^80, with the signature and rubric of the said J. H. Taylor imitated; that upon the presentation of the pale to J.  W. Marker, agent of Olsen  &amp; Co., the latter, believing the false statements made  by the accused, delivered to him the sum  of P63 and goods to the value of P17, the accused  Brown not being authorized by Taylor to.write the name of the latter on said  <em>vale</em> or to present the <em>vale</em> in the store of Walter E. Olsen &amp; Co. and collect the said amount.</p>
<p>The cause having been instituted under said information, the court, in view of the result, sentenced the accused to imprisonment for one year eight months  and twenty-one days in Bilibid Prison, to pay a fine of C&gt;25 pesetas, Philippine currency, to restore to Walter E. Olsen ik Co. the sum of P80,  and, in case of insolvency, to subsidiary  imprisonment  and to  pay the costs, from which judgment the accused  has appealed.</p>
<p>The facts fully proven in the present cause  are: That in the afternoon of September 10,1906, the accused, Brown, presented himself at the cigar store of  Walter E. Olsen, situated on the  Escolta, city of  Manila, and  exhibited to J. W. Marker, an employee of the store, the <em>vale</em> which is the  basis of this cause, stating  that J. H. Taylor could not give him at that time the money which he wanted and on  this account turned  over to him said  <em>vale</em> to have it cashed at said cigar store, and  as Marker considered tile signature of the <em>vale</em> genuine and had  confidence in the accused, who on other occasions had been  at  the store to cash  various checks of Taylor,  and because he had been in charge of the "Lone  Star Cafe," he accepted the <em>vale</em> and  delivered to  the  accused  its value, partly in merchandise and partly in cash; Marker, on the following day, delivered the rale to the owner of the cigar  store, Olsen, as a voucher for the sale (cash) and  goods  to  the amount of P80.   No restitution of the said sum or value was made to the offended party from that time until  the date of the information, by  the accused or  by any  other person, according to the testimony of J. W. Marker  and Walter E. Olsen.</p>
<p>John  H. Taylor denied  that the signature and  rubric written on said <em>vale</em> were his, although it  has some similarity to his signature, and  stated that he never signed or delivered such a document to the accused  or to any other person for the purpose of obtaining money and goods from the said cigar store.   The secret-service agent, George W. Marshall, testified that,  in a conversation  which he had with the accused, the latter confessed  to him  voluntarily to have written the said <em>vale</em> because he was pressed and needed money to free himself from his creditors.</p>
<p>It  is seen  from the facts as proved  that the handwriting, signature, and rubric of Taylor were  simulated or imitated on the <em>vale</em> attached to folio 14 of  the record to the prejudice of Walter E. Olsen, whose employee, J. W. Marker, at the said cigar store, delivered money and goods to the value  of P80 to the accused, Walter B.  Brown, because of the  false <em>vale</em>, the latter not having  reimbursed the injured party, the said Taylor having refused to recognize said  <em>vale</em> and  having denied the authenticity of the signature and rubric consisting of his initials and surname, written thereon in  imitation of his handwriting  and  genuine signature.</p>
<p>Article  304 of the Penal Code says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"He who, to the prejudice of a third person  or with intent of causing it,  shall, in a private document, commit any  of the falsifications specified in  article  300 shall  be punished,  etc."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No. 1 of article 300 cited says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"By counterfeiting or feigning any writing, signature, or rubric."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The crime specified in article 304  in  connection  with article 300 of the Penal  Code having been .proven, the guilt of the accused was shown upon the trial as the sole author by direct  participation  and properly convicted of the falsification  of  said <em>vale</em>,  executed for the sole purpose  of obtaining  from the cigar store managed  by J.  W. Walter [Marker]  money  and goods to the value of P80.</p>
<p>In the commission of this crime neither an extenuating nor aggravating  circumstance is to be  found, wherefore the penalty prescribed by the law is to be imposed in its medium grade.</p>
<p>With respect to the alleged nullity  of  the complaint,  as claimed by the defense, because of its amendment after the accused had made his plea of not guilty, which amendment consisted of the insertion  therein of a translation into Spanish of the falsified  <em>vale</em> or  document,  it being taken into consideration that the amendment was a matter of form and subject to the discretion of the court, and has not prejudiced  any essential right of the accused (sec. 9, General Orders,  No.  58), and taking into account  that the  defendant,  Walter  B. Brown,  understands English perfectly, and accepted service of the complaint also translated into English and  testified at the trial in the same language, the said amendment in the form of the complaint lias  not affected the proceedings, nor has it brought about the nullity of the judgment appealed.</p>
<p>For these reasons, in our opinion, the judgment appealed from should be affirmed, the accused, Walter  B.  Brown, however, should be sentenced to the penalty of one year eight months and twenty-one days of <em>presidio correccional</em>, according  to the  code,  instead of prision  as imposed  by the court, with  the costs of this instance.  So ordered.</p>
