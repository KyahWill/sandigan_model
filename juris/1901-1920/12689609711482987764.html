				G.R. No. 2339, May 05, 1905</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. BALDOMERO RAMOS ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This case has heretofore been dismissed by this court so far as the
appellant Eusebio Concepcion is concerned. The violent abduction of
Maria Josef is fully proved, as is also the participation of the
defendants in the act. Those defendants who stayed outside of the house
are equally guilty as principals with those who entered. As to
Inocencio Sulit Juan the penalty is increased to fourteen years eight
months and one day. In all other respects the judgment against the
appellants other than Eusebio Concepcion is affirmed, with one-fourth
of the costs of this instance against each of them.<p></p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Johnson, </em>and <em>Carson, JJ., </em>concur.</p></div>
