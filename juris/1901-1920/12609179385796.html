				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The defendant  in this  case was prosecuted in the Court of Customs Appeals  for a  violation of section 3 of the act of Congress  of March  3, 1903  (32 Stat.  L., 1213), and was convicted of the offense of introducing into the Philippine Islands a woman for the purpose of prostitution.</p>
<p>The defendant  insisted in the court below,  and insists here,  that the Court of Customs Appeals had no jurisdiction of the offense.   Most of the questions raised by him on this point have been  determined adversely  to him by the decision in the case of Oehlers <em>vs</em>. Hartwig, No. 2030,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> just decided (4  Off.  Gaz.,  123.)  Upon the question of jurisdiction the only difference between  that case and this one is that there  the action was commenced in the  Court of First Instance, while here the defendant was prosecuted in the Court of Customs  Appeals, and the  defendant says that while Congress has expressly  confirmed the acts of the Commission organizing  the Courts of First Instance, it has taken no  such  action  in regard to the Court of Customs Appeals. By virtue of the instructions of President McKinley to the Philippine Commission, the  latter was given power to  establish courts.  It established,  on February 6, 1902, the Court of Customs  Appeals (Act No. 355).  The  action of  the  President, in authorizing  the Commission to exercise the powers set  forth in  the said instructions was expressly ratified by Congress in the act of July 1, 1902 (32 Stat. L., 691).</p>
<p>Upon the  merits of the case the evidence is sufficient to support the judgment, which is hereby affirmed, with the costs of this instance  against the appellant.  So  ordered.</p>
<em>Arellano, C. J.,  Mapa, Johnson,</em> and <em>Carson, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
