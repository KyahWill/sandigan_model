				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The purpose&nbsp; of&nbsp; this&nbsp; action was 'to&nbsp; recover from&nbsp; the defendants the parcels&nbsp; of&nbsp; land described in paragraphs 4 and 5 of the complaint.<br><br>The plaintiffs allege&nbsp; that&nbsp; they are&nbsp; the&nbsp; only heirs&nbsp; of Maria Andrada, deceased; that Maria&nbsp; Andrada died&nbsp; intestate; that after the death&nbsp; of Maria Andrada, the defendant, Felix Sevilla,&nbsp; took possession of the land in question;&nbsp; that Felix Sevilla sold a portion&nbsp; of the said land to his co-defendant, Corazon&nbsp; Ch. Veloso;&nbsp; that&nbsp; the plaintiffs, as&nbsp; the only heirs of Maria Andrada,&nbsp; are&nbsp; entitled&nbsp; to the possession&nbsp; of&nbsp; the property in question,&nbsp; and that the defendants are wrongfully withholding from&nbsp; them the possession&nbsp; of the same.<br><br>The plaintiffs prayed&nbsp; for the&nbsp; possession of the land in question, together with damages in the&nbsp; sum of P1,000 for the wrongful withholding&nbsp; of the same,&nbsp; and&nbsp; costs.<br><br>The defendants answered the petition of the plaintiffs and alleged that Maria Andrada, on the 9th of November, 1904, by means of a public document, <i>"de donacion absoluta e&nbsp; irrevocable"</i> gave to&nbsp; the defendant,&nbsp; Felix&nbsp; Sevilla,&nbsp; the parcels of land referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5 of the complaint;&nbsp; that&nbsp; at&nbsp; the&nbsp; time of the said&nbsp; donation Maria Andrada was the absolute owner of the said property and that the same was free from any incumbrance whatsoever; that the said donation was ratified by Maria Andrada in three other public documents, bearing: date of the&nbsp; 16th of November,&nbsp; 1904, the 10th of January, 1905, and the 10th of April,&nbsp; 1905, respectively, and that the plaintiifs knew of the said&nbsp; donation as early as&nbsp; the 16th of August, 1905.<br><br>After hearing the evidence adduced during the&nbsp; trial of the cause, the lower court found&nbsp; that&nbsp; the said donation was executed in&nbsp; violation&nbsp; of the provisions of article 634 of the Civil Code and was, therefore, null&nbsp; and void.&nbsp; Said article 634 provides&nbsp; that:<br><blockquote>"A donation may&nbsp; comprise all of the actual property of the donor or a part of it, provided he reserves in fee simple or in usufruct what is required&nbsp; for his. support in a&nbsp; condition&nbsp; corresponding to&nbsp; his circumstances."<br></blockquote>The evident theory of the lower&nbsp; court was that a donation of <i>all </i>of the actual property&nbsp; of a donor or a <i>part of it</i> without a&nbsp; reservation in&nbsp; fee simple&nbsp; or in usufruct&nbsp; was void <i>ab initio</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; This interpretation of said section is not justified.&nbsp; A donation of all of the&nbsp; actual&nbsp; property of the donor or a part of it without reservation in fee simple or&nbsp; in usufruct&nbsp; is not&nbsp; void,&nbsp; but voidable&nbsp; only.&nbsp; Any other interpretation of said article would&nbsp; place a limitation upon the right of owners of property to dispose of the same.&nbsp; The article, however, does give to the donor a right to have the donation declared null and void&nbsp; if&nbsp; made in contravention of its provisions.&nbsp; (5 Manresa,&nbsp; pp. 121-130.)&nbsp;&nbsp; The donation&nbsp; was made on the&nbsp; 9th of November,&nbsp; 1904, and was ratified three times after that, dates as above stated.<br><br>Maria Andrada died on the 23d of January, 1908.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no proof in the record that she ever took any steps to have said donation annulled, or that she&nbsp; ever&nbsp; complained to any person or persons whatever concerning the provisions of said&nbsp; donation.<br><br>The foregoing would seem to be sufficient discussion of the questions presented to dispose of them, but an examination of&nbsp; document marked No. 3, dated November 9, 1904, the same being one of the documents ratifying&nbsp; the&nbsp; said donation, discloses&nbsp; that Maria&nbsp; Andrada, in paragraph 1 of said&nbsp; document,&nbsp; did&nbsp; make the following reservation:<br><blockquote>"1.&nbsp; That there is not included in the property I gave to Felix&nbsp; Sevilla y Macam&nbsp; on November 9, 1904, the monthly installment of fifty pesos&nbsp; which I then reserved to myself for suitable living&nbsp; expenses and other needs, which sum, while I&nbsp; live, shall be derived from either&nbsp; the rental or the sale of&nbsp; the property given to Felix Sevilla y Macam; and in fact,&nbsp; to date,&nbsp; I have received&nbsp; monthly not only fifty, but eighty-five pesos, in addition to what I have also asked and received from Felix Sevilla out of&nbsp; what he earns in his office."<br></blockquote>With&nbsp; this reservation in the donation, certainly there has been no violation of the provisions of said article 634.<br><br>Upon&nbsp; a full consideration of all of the facts&nbsp; adduced during the trial&nbsp; of the&nbsp; cause, we find no foundation for the claim of the plaintiffs.&nbsp; There is no proof that the donee failed at any&nbsp; time&nbsp; to&nbsp; comply with the provisions of&nbsp; said donation, nor is there any proof that Maria Andrada&nbsp; ever attempted to revoke the said donation.<br><br>For all the foregoing reasons,&nbsp; we hold that the judgment of the lower court should&nbsp; be reversed and that a judgment should be entered absolving the defendants from any liability under the said&nbsp; complaint, and without any&nbsp; finding as to costs, it is so ordered.<br><br><i>Torres, Mapa, Carson, </i> and <i>Moreland, JJ.</i>, concur.<br></div>
