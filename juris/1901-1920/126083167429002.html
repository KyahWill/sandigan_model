				<H3>ARCADIO MAXILOM, PLAINTIFF  AND APPELLEE VS. GAUDENCIO TABOTABO, AS EXECUTOR OF THE  ESTATE OF DIEGO  TABOTABO, DECEASED, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Some time  in the year 1901 one  Fausto Tabotabo  died, leaving certain assets and liabilities.   On the 21st  day of October, 1901, Diego Tabotabo, father of Fausto  Tabotabo, upon petition, was declared the  universal heir of the said Fausto Tabotabo,  and accepted  the inheritance  pure  and simple,  taking possession  of the  same.   Later  the said Diego Tabotabo died in the Province of Cebu, without having the liabilities of the said deceased Fausto  Tabotabo.</p>
<p>Luter the court appointed commissioners in the estate of the said Diego Tabotabo, in accordance with the provisions of section 669 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions. This  commission was (duly organized for  the purpose of considering claims against the estate of the said Diego Tabotabo.  The plaintiff herein presented a claim of indebtedness before the said commission for the sum of 1,062.37 pesos, Mexican currency, which claim the said commission allowed against the said estate.  From this decision of the said commission the executor appealed to the Court of First Instance.   The case was duly tried in the Court of First Instance, which court affirmed  the  decision of the said commission and allowed the claim against the estate of the said Diego Tabotabo.  From this decision of the Court of  First  Instance  the  defendant appealed  to this court and made the following assignment of errors:</p>
<p>First. The court committed an  error in permitting the plaintiff, Arcadio Maxilom, to testify as a witness during the trial of said cause.</p>
<p>Second. The court committed an error in not declaring that the action of the plaintiff was  prescribed.</p>
<p>Third. The court committed  an  error in  rendering  a decision against the defendant, basing the same upon the declaration of the said plaintiff, Arcadio Maxilom.</p>
<p>With reference to the  first above-noted assignment of error, the defendant and appellant relies upon the  provisions of section 383 of  the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions.   Said section, among other things, provides  that the following persons can not be witnesses:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"7.  Parties.or assignors of parties to an action or proceeding, or persons in whose behalf an action or proceeding is prosecuted,  against  an executor or administrator  or other representative of a  deceased  person, or against  a person of unsound mind, upon a claim or demand against the estate of such deceased person or against  such  person of unsound mind, can not testify as  to any matter  of fact occurring before the death of such deceased person or before such person  became of unsound mind."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The defendant and appellant failed to make a motion for a new trial in the lower court; therefore we can not examine the  evidence for the purpose of  ascertaining w.hether or not the facts set out in the decision of the court are sustained by such evidence; but, in view of the fact that the above assignment of error is based upon the adrnissibility of certain testimony offered by witnesses, to which objection was made and an  exception taken during the trial, we are permitted to examine such testimony for the purpose of ascertaining whether the testimony offered was of a class which is prohibited by said paragraph 7 of section 383.</p>
<p>During the trial of the cause in the lower court the plaintiff appeared as a witness and was asked certain questions concerning  an open account (Exhibit B)  existing between the plaintiff  and the deceased Fausto  Tabotabo prior to the latter's death.  The defendant objected to this testimony upon the theory that said paragraph  7 of section 383 prohibited the said plaintiff from testifying concerning the claim against the  estate of the deceased,  because the action  was  prosecuted  against  the executor or  administrator of such deceased  person.  The lower  court overruled  this  objection,  the defendant  excepted, and now relies upon said  exception for the purpose of having the decision of the lower court reversed.</p>
<p>It is clear from an  examination of the record that the plaintiff was a party to an action against an executor or administrator of a deceased person upon a claim  against the estate of such deceased person.  It seems clear also from said section  383  that  he was  absolutely prohibited  from being a witness in said action for the purpose of giving testimony concerning such  claim or demand. We are of the opinion and  so hold that said  paragraph 7 of  section &amp;83 absolutely prohibits a  party to an action against an  executor or administrator  of a deceased person  from testifying to any matter of fact  occurring before the death of such deceased person, upon a claim or demand against the estate of such deceased person.</p>
<p>The present case very  clearly exemplifies the wisdom of the provisions of said paragraph 7.   Said Exhibit B represented a settlement of the accounts between the plaintiff and the said Fausto Tabotabo, in which they both agreed on the 18th day of March, 1899, or about two .years before the death of the said Fausto Tabotabo.  This account was signed by both the plaintiff herein and the deceased Fausto Tabotabo,  showing  upon its face that  there was due at that time  from Fausto Tabotabo to the plaintiff herein the sum of 312.37 pesos, Mexican.  Notwithstanding this settlement, made by the plaintiff and  the  said  deceased Fausto Tabotabo, several years after,  in the year  1906, the plaintiff presented a claim against the estate of the deceased for the sum of 1,062.37 pesos, Mexican currency, alleging and attempting to prove that credits to the amount of 750  pesos, Mexican currency, which entered  into the settlement of the said accounts made on the 18th day of March, 1899,  had never, in  fact, been received, and that therefore instead of there being due from the said Fausto Tabotabo the sum of 312.37  pesos, there was actually due the sum of 1,062.37  pesos.</p>
<p>If testimony of the character  offered by the  plaintiff should be allowed, then all sorts of fictitious claims might be presented  and allowed by  designing persons, without any  protection whatever on the part of the estate of deceased persons.  Provisions similar  to  the article above quoted have been adopted in practically all of the States of the United States.  Article 1880  of  the Code of Procedure of California is very similar in its terms to the provisions of said section 383.   The supreme court of California has held many times, under the section of the code of California,  that "Parties to an action against an executor or administrator, upon a claim or demand against the estate  of deceased persons," <em>can not be witnesses.</em> (Blood <em>vs</em>. Fairbanks, 50 Cal., 420.)</p>
<p>In the very early history of the  common law parties interested in actions or proceedings were prohibited  from giving testimony during the trial of  said actions, or proceedings.   The theory of this original disqualification was that persons interested were likely to bear false witness. Long experience, however, has demonstrated that this rule worked greater hardship  than good.  Liberal rules for cross-examinationi have made it possible to disclose in the presence of the court whether  or not interested witnesses were actually falsifying.  However, the  original common law rule is still in force, in the majority of the states of the United States in actions where the adverse party in deceased.  As was said by Brickell, chief justice,  in the case of Louis <em>vs</em>. Easton  (50  Ala.,  471),  in discussing this Maine question, "If death has  closed the lips of one party, the policy of the law is to close the lips of the other."</p>
<p>With reference to the second above-noted assignment of error, the objection that the claim presented by the plaintiff was prescribed,  not having been raised in the lower court, it can not be  raised here.  (Domingo <em>vs</em>. Osorio,  7 Phil. Rep., 405.)</p>
<p>With reference to the third above-noted assignment of error, we are of  the  opinion, for the reasons stated in the discussion of the first above-noted assignment of error, that the lower  court erred  in  rendering a judgment against the defendant based upon the testimony of the plaintiff Arcadio Maxilom.</p>
<p>For all  of the foregoing reasons, the  judgment of  the lower court is hereby reversed and for the reason that the court committed  an error in admitting the testimony of the plaintiff contrary to the provisions of paragraph 7 of section 383,1 and believing that but for this error the plaintiff might have presented other proof in support of his claim, the cause is hereby remanded  to the court below, ordering that a new trial  be granted in said  cause by  said court. Without any statement as to costs, it is so ordered.</p>
