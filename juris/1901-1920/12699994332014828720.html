				G.R. No. 13177, March 12, 1918</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. FELINO CUNANAN, FERMIN BUCUD, PIO (POLICARPIO) BALATBAT, MARIANO BALATBAT AND HILARIA SISON, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">We have to determine whether or not Felino Cunanan, Fermin Bucud, Pio 
(Policarpio) Balatbat, and Mariano Balatbat, defendants in case No. 1991 of the 
Court of First Instance of Pampanga, and Hilaria Sison, defendant in case No. 
1989 of the same Court of First Instance, all of whom were tried together, are 
guilty of having murdered one Numeriano Regalado. The trial judge so found and 
condemned Felino Cunanan, Fermin Bucud, and Policarpio Balatbat to the death 
penalty, and Mariano Balatbat and Hilaria Sison to life imprisonment, all to 
indemnify jointly and severally the heirs of the deceased, Numeriano Regalado in 
the amount of P1,000, and each to pay one fifth part of the costs. The attorney 
for Fermin Bucud and the attorney for the other defendants, on appeal, make 
numerous assignments of error, all of which, however, can be resolved as 
relating either to the proof or to the penalty, and contend with much force that 
their clients are innocent. Counsel have also presented two motions for a new 
trial in this court.<p></p>
<p>On a careful review of the evidence, in connection with the decision of the 
trial court, we have come to the conclusion, as to the defendant Hilaria Sison, 
that she must be held to be not guilty. The theory of the trial court as to this 
defendant was that she had enticed the deceased to a lonely place to his death. 
The theory of the Attorney-General as to this defendant is that she and the 
deceased had had illicit relations and that they were together on this occasion 
to accomplish such a purpose, when her husband and his three comrades set upon 
Regalado and killed him. No direct evidence connecting her with the crime is 
found in the record. It therefore results, as held by the Chief Justice in the 
case of The United States <em>vs</em>. Guevara ([1903] 2 Phil., 528), that the 
mere presence of the defendant at the time and place of the commission of the 
crime is not of itself sufficient to show such an act of simultaneous 
cooperation as to make such a defendant an accessory to the crime.</p>
<p>As to the other four defendants, we hold that they have been proved guilty 
beyond a reasonable doubt of the crime of homicide because of having killed 
Numeriano Regalado. Briefly stated, these four defendants, on one of the early 
days of June, 1916, appear to have waited in a lonely place, armed with clubs, 
for the arrival of Numeriano Regalado and Hilaria Sison, and then to have killed 
Regalado and thrown his body into the river. This prominent fact is demonstrated 
by one eyewitness, by the evidence of other witnesses who identified these 
defendants as having been in the locality at this time, and by medical 
testimony. The defense was limited to an attempt to establish an alibi. Counsel 
on appeal also endeavor further to substantiate their alibi and to impeach the 
testimony of the principal witness for the prosecution, intimating that the 
reason why he testified against the defendants was in order to be able to live 
with Benita Sison, wife of one of the defendants. We do not think that a new 
trial would change the result.</p>
<p>The lower court took into consideration the circumstances of premeditation 
and <em>alevosia</em>. It is undeniable that the accused seem to have known that 
the deceased and Hilaria Sison would pass by a particular place, but this sole 
circumstance does not warrant the deduction of known premeditation. Says the 
supreme court of Spain:</p>
<p>"The finding by the jury that the accused had concocted the act beforehand 
well knowing that the offended parties were going to pass that afternoon at the 
point where the act was committed, does not constitute a sufficient foundation 
for the existence of the aggravating circumstance of known premeditation. In 
order that this circumstance may properly be considered it is necessary to 
determine when the intent to commit the crime was engendered in the mind of the 
accused, the motive which gave rise to it, the means which they had beforehand 
selected to carry out the criminal intention (independently of the fact of 
having waited in ambush for their victim and attacked him without danger to 
their person, which constitutes the circumstance of <em>alevosia</em>, already 
considered), in fine, all those facts and antecedents which combined show that 
the crime was <em>knowingly</em> premeditated, as required by law, or, that the 
accused acted not only with a preexisting design, which is a condition 
ordinarily found in all crime, but with that cold and deep meditation and 
tenacious persistence in the accomplishment of his criminal purpose, which is 
the distinctive characteristic of this aggravating circumstance, whether as 
qualifying or generically considered." (Decision, November 9, 1895.)</p>
<p>As to the circumstance of <em>alevosia</em> there is also doubt as to its. 
existence, but somewhat connected therewith is another circumstance, which has 
been proved, of advantage being taken of superior strength. Another aggravating 
circumstance which must be considered is that the crime was committed in an 
uninhabited place and by a band of more than three armed men. The 
Attorney-General suggests as a mitigating circumstance, working in behalf of Pio 
(Policarpio) Balatbat and Mariano Balatbat, the fact that the act was committed 
in the immediate vindication of a grave offense to the one committing the 
felony. If the theory of the Attorney-General is correct, this of course is 
possible, for Mariano Balatbat was the husband of Hilaria Sison and Pio 
(Policarpio) Balatbat was her father-in-law, and these two may have conspired to 
commit the homicide because of the illicit relations existing between Hilaria 
Sison and the deceased. We find no proof of this mitigating circumstance.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, we acquit Hilaria Sison, with one-fifth of the 
costs of both instances <em>de officio</em>. We further find the other four 
defendants, Fermin Bucud, Felino Cunanan, Mariano Balatbat, and Pio (Policarpio) 
Balatbat, guilty of the crime of homicide and sentence each of them to seventeen 
years, four months, and one day of <em>reclusion temporal</em>, with the 
accessory penalties provided by law, to pay jointly and severally to the heirs 
of Numeriano Regalado the amount of P1,000, with one-fourth of the costs of both 
instances against each appellant. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Carson, Araullo, Street, Avance√±a</em>, and 
<em>Fisher, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Johnson, J.</em>, dissents.</p></div>
