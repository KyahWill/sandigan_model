				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for the writ of habeas corpus.&nbsp; It was presented&nbsp; in the&nbsp; Court of First Instance&nbsp; of the city&nbsp; of Manila, on the 30th day of January, 1915.<br><br>From the record brought to this court&nbsp; the&nbsp; following facts appear:&nbsp; (First)&nbsp; That&nbsp; on the&nbsp; 11th&nbsp; day of December, 1914, there arrived at the port of Manila, on the steamship <span style="font-style: italic;">Taisang </span>seventy-eight aliens,&nbsp; among&nbsp; whom was&nbsp; the said Tan Lin Jo: (second) an examination was&nbsp; held concerning&nbsp; the&nbsp; right of&nbsp; the said Tan Lin Jo to enter&nbsp; the Philippine&nbsp; Islands, by the board of special inquiry, on&nbsp; the 8th&nbsp; day of&nbsp; January,&nbsp; 1915;&nbsp; that&nbsp; after investigating&nbsp; the right of the petitioner to enter, the board of special inquiry denied him the right to enter upon the ground that he&nbsp; did not present the certificate required by law for the admission of&nbsp; Chinese: (third)&nbsp; an&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; from the decision of&nbsp; the board of special inquiry was taken to the Insular Collector of Customs who, on the 19th day of January, 1915, affirmed the decision of&nbsp; said board: (fourth)&nbsp; the said Tan Lin Jo alleges that he is fourteen years of age; that he is the son of Tan Sui Bok who had been a merchant in the municipality of Surigao, in the Philippine Islands; that his father (Tan Sui Bok)&nbsp; died in the Philippine Islands in the year 1908, leaving an estate valued at&nbsp; P3,992.93.<br><br>The foregoing facts present the question whether or not the minor son of a resident Chinese merchant has a right to enter territory of&nbsp; the United States, after the&nbsp; death of his 'parent&nbsp; (father).&nbsp; There is no allegation&nbsp; that his mother ever resided in the&nbsp; Philippine Islands.&nbsp; The proof shows that his mother died in China some&nbsp; years before the commencement of the present proceeding.&nbsp; It is also admitted that the petitioner had never lived in the Philippine Islands.&nbsp; While he now makes some claim to a right to enter the. Philippine Islands as a student,&nbsp; he&nbsp; does not present the "section six certificate."<br><br>Upon the question presented here, with reference to the right of the petitioner to enter the&nbsp; Philippine Islands, we have&nbsp; heretofore decided:<br><br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) That&nbsp; the&nbsp; wife and&nbsp; minor children of a resident Chinese merchant can enter territory of the United States without the "section six certificate,"&nbsp; while such husband and father still resides there.&nbsp; (Lee&nbsp; Jua <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Collector of Customs p. 24, ante, and other cases there cited.)<br><br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) That a minor (Chinaman) who had been&nbsp; admitted into territory of the United States to enjoy the companionship and&nbsp; protection&nbsp; of his Chinese parents had a right to reenter such territory, during his minority, even after the death of&nbsp; his parents who&nbsp; had died while residing in the Philippine Islands.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Lee&nbsp; Jua <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Collector of Customs, supra, and other cases there cited.)<br><br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>) That the wife of a resident Chinese merchant and her minor children&nbsp; who had been admitted into&nbsp; territory of the&nbsp; United States,&nbsp; and who had resided therein&nbsp; for a number of years,&nbsp; had a right to&nbsp; return to the Philippine Islands, after a temporary visit to China whither&nbsp; they had gone&nbsp; with the idea of returning&nbsp; to the Philippine Islands with&nbsp; the&nbsp; husband and&nbsp; father, notwithstanding&nbsp; the fact that the father died in China during said temporary visit. (Lee Jua <i>vs.</i> Collector of Customs, supra, and other cases there cited.)<br><br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>)&nbsp; That a minor child who accompanied his father, a resident&nbsp; Chinese, on his return to the Philippine Islands was not&nbsp; permitted&nbsp; to enter after&nbsp; the father had been refused landing upon the ground that he had a contagious disease;&nbsp; that his right&nbsp; to be admitted depended upon the presence of his parents in territory of the United States. (Lee Jua <i>vs.</i> Collector of Customs, supra, and other cases there cited; Lo Po <i>vs.</i> McCoy, 8 Phil. Rep., 343.)<br><br>(e)&nbsp; That the wife and minor children&nbsp; (who never had been in the Philippine Islands) of a resident Chinese merchant, which merchant had left the Philippine&nbsp; Islands and had died in China,&nbsp; were not permitted to enter the Philippine Islands, after&nbsp; the&nbsp; death&nbsp; of the husband&nbsp; and father. (Lee Jua <i>vs.</i> Collector of Customs, supra, and other cases there cited.)<br><br>In&nbsp; discussing the question&nbsp;&nbsp; of the&nbsp; right of the&nbsp; minor children&nbsp; of a resident Chinese&nbsp; merchant to enter territory of the United States, after death of the father, the Federal&nbsp; District Court of the Northern District of California, in the case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Ex parte</span> Chan&nbsp; Fooi (217&nbsp; Fed. Rep., 308) decided, in a case where, between the time of the sailing of the minor from China and his arrival in&nbsp; territory&nbsp; of the United States, the father died,&nbsp; that the minor child had no right to&nbsp; enter.&nbsp; In&nbsp; that case the court said: "It&nbsp; is urged by petitioner that, as he was not compelled under the conditions existing at&nbsp; the time of his departure from China to procure the certificate required by section six,&nbsp; because his right to enter as&nbsp; the minor son of a merchant&nbsp; was not dependent upon&nbsp; the production of such certificate, he should now be permitted to make other proof of his&nbsp; status&nbsp; as a student or a merchant, and should not be put to the expense and trouble of returning to China to secure the certificate which, it is further urged, the&nbsp; Act makes the sole evidence permissible <span style="font-style: italic;">only&nbsp; </span>on the part&nbsp; of a&nbsp; person producing&nbsp; the same; the implication being that&nbsp; a person not producing the same may be permitted to furnish other&nbsp; evidence of his right to enter.&nbsp; To&nbsp; this latter&nbsp; contention&nbsp; I&nbsp; can not agree.&nbsp; Section 12 of the Act of Congress provides:<br><br><blockquote>" 'No&nbsp; Chinese person&nbsp; shall be&nbsp; permitted to enter the United States&nbsp; by&nbsp; land&nbsp; without producing to the proper officer of customs the certificate in this Act required of Chinese&nbsp; persons seeking to land from a vessel.'<br><br>"This&nbsp; provision&nbsp; indicates quite&nbsp; clearly the intention of Congress that&nbsp; no person falling within&nbsp; the provisions of section six may be allowed to enter the United States in the absence of the certificate therein required.<br><br>"Equally untenable is the other contention that the petitioner is relieved&nbsp; from producing the certificate, and entitled to furnish other&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; of&nbsp; his status as a student or a merchant, because of the circumstances attending his departure from China, and the hardship that would be occasioned by compelling him to return thereto.&nbsp; Had his father lived, he could have entered by virtue of his communicated status&nbsp; as the son of a resident Chinese merchant.<br></blockquote><br>With the death of the father, this status was&nbsp; destroyed; but this fact does not relieve him of the necessity of producing the&nbsp; evidence required by law, if he desires to establish another&nbsp; and very&nbsp; different status upon which&nbsp; to base a right to&nbsp; land.&nbsp;&nbsp; For students or merchants coming to the United States for the first time, the Act prescribes&nbsp; the only evidence upon&nbsp; which entry into&nbsp; the United States may be had.&nbsp; If petitioner desires to enter as a student or a merchant, coming here for the first time, he must fortify himself with the evidence which the&nbsp; law&nbsp; requires&nbsp; [declares] 'the sole evidence permissible.'&nbsp;&nbsp; (The section&nbsp; six certificate).&nbsp; That&nbsp; it would work a&nbsp; hardship&nbsp; upon him to require the production of this evidence&nbsp; is&nbsp; beside the question.&nbsp;&nbsp; That he&nbsp; left China&nbsp; without this evidence,&nbsp; because of his&nbsp; right to enter as the minor son of a merchant, cannot now&nbsp; relieve him of the&nbsp; necessity of producing it.&nbsp; The law is too clear upon this point&nbsp; to warrant a construction setting aside its terms.&nbsp; If, indeed, petitioner be a&nbsp; student, [or a merchant], as claimed, he might have procured a certificate&nbsp; to that effect before&nbsp; his&nbsp; departure from China.<br><br>Failing to do so, and relying solely, upon his communicated status, he cannot now complain&nbsp; of hardship because such communicated status&nbsp; was&nbsp; destroyed by the happening&nbsp; of a contingency, the death of his father, which in the nature of things, might happen at any time."<br><br>With reference&nbsp; to the first and&nbsp; second&nbsp; assignments&nbsp; of error, this court has heretofore decided that the Attorney-General for the Philippine Islands, in his official capacity, has a perfect right to represent the officials of the Insular Government in courts&nbsp; of record, and that he has a&nbsp; right to make return to a writ directed&nbsp; to the Insular Collector of Customs, by virtue of his official duties.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Section&nbsp; 45&nbsp; of Act No. 136;&nbsp; Tin Lio <i>vs.</i> Collector&nbsp; of Customs, p. 32,&nbsp; ante; Lee Jua <i>vs.</i> Collector of Customs, <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>.)<br><br>We have also decided in numerous cases that the department of&nbsp; Customs&nbsp; is authorized, in the&nbsp; first&nbsp; instance,&nbsp; to pass upon the question of&nbsp; the right of the Chinese&nbsp; aliens to enter the territory of the United States.&nbsp; (Tin Lio <i>vs.</i> Collector&nbsp; of Customs,&nbsp; supra; Lee Jua <i>vs.</i> Collector of Customs, supra.)<br><br>For all of the foregoing, we are of the opinion and&nbsp; so hold that the&nbsp; judgment of the lower court should be affirmed, with&nbsp; costs.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Carson,</i> and <i>Araullo, JJ., </i>concur.<br></div>
