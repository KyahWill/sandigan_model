				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The plaintiff, the owner of a horse, harness, and calesa, arranged a rattle for  the purpose of disposing of them. He received for the tickets sold $210.  On January 3,1902, he took the property to the place where the drawing was to be made.  The tickets were placed in a box, and the last one  drawn, which was the defendant's,  was  the winning one.  Immediately after  the drawing it was  discovered that a ticket owned by Irwin had not been placed in the box.  A discussion arose among the twenty or forty ticket holders present as to what should  be done, some demanding that there should  be  another  drawing.  The  defendant in the meantime settled with Irwin  by giving him a half interest  in  the property, got into  the  calesa,  remained there five  minutes or more, and then  drove  away.  It appears  that the plaintiff  did not, after the drawing, expressly give his consent to this act of  the defendant. But.  it is also proved to our satisfaction that  the plaintiff was  there at the time and made no objection to it.</p>
<p> The  defendant refused to return the property, and the plaintiff brought this action to recover it.  He bases his right on the proposition that he was the  owner of it, that the defendant took it from him against  his will and has refused to return it.</p>
<ol>
  <li>   The case turns,  in our opinion, upon the question whether these effects were  voluntarily delivered  by the plaintiff or not.  The  plaintiff  had  received  for them $210.  The only purpose of the  drawing was to determine which one of the ticket holders was the owner.  The plaintiff brought the  property to the drawing for  the purpose of allowing the  owner to  take it away when that owner should have  been designated.  As the plaintiff himself says  in his brief, it was "waiting"  outside.   After  the winner was known no affirmative action on the part of the plaintiff was necessary in order to place him, the winner, in possession.  The property was  there  for  the express purpose of being taken away by  him.   The plaintiff saw it so taken away and made no objection.</li>
</ol>
<p> To our minds the case does not  differ from one in which two persons playing a prohibited game place the  stakes on the table.   At the end of the game the winner takes up the money and goes away with it.   It is true that after the game there is no actual delivery of the money by the loser to the winner, nor is there any express consent that the latter may take  it away, but it can not in such a case be doubted that the loser has voluntarily paid what he has lost.   He expressed his consent that the winner might take the money when he placed it on the table and  agreed that it should abide the result of the game.</p>
<p> We should have had a different question had the plaintiff not taken  the property to the place for the drawing.  So the case would have been different had the plaintiff after the drawing objected to its removal by the defendant.  In our opinion the plaintiff voluntarily delivered the property to the defendant, and he can not, therefore, recover.</p>
<p> It makes no difference whether the transaction  was or was not illegal.  If, as  respects  the plaintiff, the  raffle was illegal because prohibited by the ordinance of the city of Manila of December 5, 1901, and it can be said that he lost the property by a prohibited game of chance, then article 1798 of the Civil Code prevents  him from  recovering it, for he voluntarily paid what he lost.</p>
<p> If, on the contrary, it should  be said  that, while the defendant won the horse by a prohibited game, yet the plaintiff, having been paid $210 for  it, did not lose it by such  a game, we have an ordinary sale of  personal property,  the payment of the price, and the  delivery of the article to the purchaser.</p>
<ol start="2">
  <li>  The defendant, against  the objection and exception of the plaintiff, was allowed  to prove the facts connected with the raffle,  'this ruling was correct.  When an action is brought to recover property it  is competent for the defendant  to show, if he can, that he won the property from the plaintiff by gambling, and that the plaintiff voluntarily delivered it  to him.  Such  evidence defeats  a recovery. (Art 1798, Civil Code.)</li>
</ol>
<p> The judgment is affirmed, with  costs against the  appellant</p>
<p> <em>Arellano, C J.,  Cooper, Mapa,</em> and <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
