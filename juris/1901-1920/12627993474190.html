				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Assuming that the findings of fact contained in the decision of the court  below are correct, it appears (1) that one Vicente Sulit occupied as a  tenant  several  parcels of land within the hacienda  of Justo Guido for the use of which he gave to the owner 30 <em>cavanes </em>of palay for every 3 <em>cavanse</em> of seed received from the latter; (2) that the said Vicente Sulit, who was a man  80 years of age, entered into an agreement with Julian  de los Reyes  whereby the former was to contribute 3Â½ <em>cavanes</em> of seed and sow  the  same, and in addition thereto, two carabaos, two harrows,  two carts, and 24 pesos in cash, and the latter was to transplant the seed and take care of and harvest the crop, the profits to be divided between them, share  and share alike, after deducting the  30 <em>cavanes</em> due to the owner of the land, Reyes to  reimburse his partner one-half of the expenses defrayed in advance by Sulit; and (3) that when the crop was ready to be harvested, Reyes being sick, Sulit did the work,  stacked  the rice, and when  the time  came  for thrashing the rice, Reyes did the thrashing.</p>
<p>But when  Sulit went upon the land to  take his  share of the rice he found Reyes selling palay to various persons, and he refused to give him (Sulit) any part thereof, saying that he was not his partner because the rice belonged to the town.</p>
<p>The court below sentenced the accused to six months' imprisonment (<em>arresto mayor</em>), to return the stolen palay, 75 <em>cavanes</em> in all, or in default thereof to  pay to the said Sulit  150  pesos,  otherwise to  suffer  the  corresponding subsidiary imprisonment at the rate of one day  for every 12J pesetas, such subsidiary imprisonment not to exceed one-third of the principal penalty,  with the costs of the proceedings.</p>
<p>The Attorney-General is of the opinion that the crime committed was  not that of theft for the reason that,  as he says, there was no <em>apoderamiento </em>of the property  of another, and suggests that the crime committed was rather that of <em>estafa</em>, thus apparently accepting the view of the counsel for the  defendant, as expressed on page 5 of the latter's brief.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact the defendant could have harvested and  thrashed the crop  in  question.  This he could have done by reason of his possession, both <em>de facto</em> and <em>de jure</em>. He was in possession of the palay of which he freely disposed without taking or abstracting the  same from anyone, and he had a right to lawfully dispose of an aliquot part of the crop.  If he had disposed of all  of the crop his action would have been unlawful.  His  unlawful disposition  of the share belonging to his partner or joint owner  (such contract being governed by the provisions relative to the contract of  partnership, by the stipulation of the parties, and by the  custom of the  country as provided  in article 1579 of the Civil Code) was undoubtedly a violation  of their  contract and a trespass upon  the rights of another but not an act constituting the crime of theft.   If the defendant was lawfully in possession of the rice he  certainly did not, when he disposed of it, take it or abstract it from another.   Such taking and abstracting is what constitutes the crime of theft.</p>
<p>We accordingly reverse the judgment appealed from and acquit the defendant  with the costs of both instances <em>de oficio</em>,  without prejudice to the institution of any other action that may be proper, as to which we make no decision.</p>
<p>After the expiration of ten days  from the date of final judgment  the case  will  be remanded  to the court below for proper procedure.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Mapa, Carson, Willard, </em>and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
