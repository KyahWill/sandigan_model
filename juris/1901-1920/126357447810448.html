				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The accused in this case was charged with the offense of unlnwfullv selling more than two decaliters of alcohol at a single sale on the 3d  day of August, 1905,  in the city of Manila without having first obtained a license to make such sale.</p>
<p>The evidence adduced at the trial  discloses  that  the .accused is the owner  of a  grocery  store; that he had  a license to  retail intoxicating liquors  at that store; that on the M of August, 1905, one  Ng-Chin, representing Kwong-Ung-Lung &amp; Co.,  came  to  the store of the accused and purchased forty bottles of alcohol, which were sold to him for the purpose of resale and which  were delivered on the same day in  the  store  of  Kwong-Ung-Lung  &amp;  Co. and paid  for upon delivery; that  each  one of these  bottles contained  some three-fourths of a liter of alcohol; and that the accused  on the said day did not  have a license for the sale of liquor by wholesale.   The accused and his employees absolutely  denied  having made  any sales of alcohol to any person  upon the day and date mentioned  in  the complaint, but we think that the  evidence conclusively establishes the facts as set  out above, and that the total amount of alcohol thus sold amounted to more than two decaliters; that the same was purchased at a  single sale and delivered at one time to the  said Kwong-Ung-Lung &amp; Co.; and that this alcohol was a distilled spirit as defined in subsection 0 of section 68 of Act No. 1189 of the Philippine Commission.</p>
<p>Section  66 of Act No. 1189 of the Philippine Commission provides that any person who carries on the business of a distiller,  rectifier, wholesale liquor  dealer, retail  liquor dealer, etc.,  *  *  *  without having1 paid the license tax therefor as required by law, shall, besides being liable for the payment of the tax for every such offense, be fined in a sum not less  than P200 nor more  than P2,000,  or  be imprisoned for a term of not more than  six  months,  in the discretion of the court; subsection 6 of section  (&gt;8 of that law provides that every  person who, for himself or on commission, sells or offers  for sale  foreign or domestic distilled .spirits  or wines in  larger quantities than two decaliters at any one time shall be regarded as a wholesale liquor dealer; and section 1 of Act  No. 1338 provides that every person who sells or offers for sale, for himself  or on commission, foreign or domestic distilled spirits, wines, or fermented  liquors  to  other persons  for the purpose  of resale shall likewise  be deemed to be a wholesale liquor dealer or wholesale dealer in fermented liquors, as the case may  be, irrespective  of  the  quantity of such  distilled spirits,  wines, or fermented liquors sold at one time.</p>
<p>The court below  imposed a  fine of P200, with the costs of the trial and subsidiary imprisonment in the event of nonpayment  of  the fine and  costs. This  court has frequently declared that subsidiary imprisonment can not be imposed in the case of offenses defined and penalized  by an act of the Philippine Commission unless expressly provided for in the act, and no such provision is to be found in the penalty for the offense of which the  accused is convicted.</p>
<p>The judgment and  sentence of the trial court should be modified by reversing so much thereof  as imposes the subsidiary imprisonment, and thus modified  should be affirmed, with the  costs of this instance against the appellant.   After expiration of  ten  days let judgment be entered  in accordance herewith and  ten days thereafter the case remanded to the court from whence it came for proper action.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Willard,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
