				<BR><BR><p></p><div align="justify">From the record&nbsp; it appears&nbsp; that Ang Kah Lian, on the 6th&nbsp; day of January 1911,&nbsp; arrived at the&nbsp; port&nbsp; of Manila on&nbsp; the&nbsp; steamship&nbsp; <i>Yingchow </i>and requested permission to enter the Philippine Islands.&nbsp; He admitted that he was a&nbsp; Chinese&nbsp; person of the age&nbsp; of 37 years.&nbsp; He&nbsp; alleged that he&nbsp; was a resident Chinese merchant of the Philippine&nbsp; Islands.&nbsp; He admitted that had&nbsp; left the Islands in the year 1907,&nbsp; He alleged that&nbsp; he was a member of a&nbsp; mercantile firm with an interest of&nbsp; P15,000 at the time he left the Islands in the year 1907.&nbsp; He admitted that before he left Manila&nbsp; in&nbsp; 1907 he withdrew P5,000 from said business. It is admitted that the business in which Ang Kah Lian was a partner went into bankruptcy about a year before his return.&nbsp;&nbsp; (January 6, 1911.)&nbsp; It is not&nbsp; denied that the records of the office of the Collector of Customs&nbsp; show that on or about the 7th of February, 1905, the Collector of Customs of the Philippine Islands had indorsed Ang Kah Lian as a resident Chinese merchant of the Philippine Islands,&nbsp; doing business at 139 Calle&nbsp; Nueva, in the city of Manila.&nbsp; The records of the office of the Collector of Customs also show that Ang Kah Lian returned the Philippine Islands and was admitted&nbsp; as a resident Chinese merchant or about the 3d of October, 1907.&nbsp;&nbsp; The records of the&nbsp; office of the Collector of Customs further show that after an investigation, a merchants certificate&nbsp; had&nbsp; been issued to Ang Kah Lian&nbsp; on&nbsp; January 22, 1907, and that at that time he was a partner in an importation of silk and dry-goods business, at 139 Calle&nbsp; Nueva, in the city of Manila, under the firm name Ang Ban-Ka, the capital of which was P85,000, and that the interest of Ang Kah&nbsp; Lian in said business was P15,000.<p>Upon the foregoing&nbsp; facts the board&nbsp; of&nbsp; special&nbsp; inquiry denied&nbsp; Ang Kah Lian the&nbsp; right to enter the Philippine Islands as a resident Chinese me upon the ground that the mercantile business in which he had been engage did not exist at the time of&nbsp; his return.</p><p>From that decision of the board&nbsp; of special inquiry,&nbsp; an appeal&nbsp; was take to the Collector&nbsp; of&nbsp; Customs, where the same was affirmed.</p><p>Later the applicant presented a petition for the writ of habeas corpus the&nbsp; Court of First Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; the city of Manila.&nbsp; After a due consideration of the facts,&nbsp; the Honorable A. S.&nbsp; Crossfield,&nbsp; judge,&nbsp; found that the petitioner was entitled to enter the Philippine Islands as a resident Chinese merchant and so ordered.</p><p>From that decision&nbsp; of the Court of First Instance the Attorney-General appealed to this court.</p><p>The principal ground of the appellant is that the lower court failed to that there had been an abuse of authority on the part of the Collector of Customs.&nbsp;&nbsp; The contention of the appellant is that courts have no authority to take jurisdiction of a case like the present, without first finding the executive department of the Government had abused&nbsp; the authority conferred upon it by law.&nbsp; This contention&nbsp; of the appellant is sustained numerous authorities (Roa<em> vs.</em> The Collector of Customs, p. 315, U. S. <em>vs</em>. Go-Siaco, 12 Phil. Rep., 490; Munoz vs. The Collector of 20 Phil.&nbsp; Rep., 494.)</p><p>It is admitted that&nbsp; Ang Kah Lian was a merchant at the time he left the Philippine Islands in the early part of the year 1907 and that he ha been a resident Chinese merchant for some years theretofore.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is also admitted that some months prior to his return the mercantile business in he was&nbsp; interested became&nbsp; bankrupt.&nbsp; It is not denied&nbsp; that he had a&nbsp; right to&nbsp; return&nbsp; to the Philippine Islands&nbsp; had his business not become bankrupt is not denied that he left the Philippine Islands in 1907 and that he left the intention of returning.&nbsp; The&nbsp; record shows that he had some&nbsp; other interests in the Philippine Islands besides&nbsp; his interest in said firm. a resident Chinese merchant of the Philippine Islands for more than a year prior to his departure in 1907, it is admitted that he had a right to return provided his business still existed. <em>No decision has been called to our and it is&nbsp; believed that none&nbsp; exists holding that the mere fact that the business of a&nbsp; resident Chinese merchant has failed during his temporary absence from territory of the United States, would have the effect of depriving him of his right to&nbsp; reenter.</em> Under the Act of Congress of November 3, 1893, a domiciled merchant in territory of the United States show that fact by parol testimony.&nbsp; He was not required, on his return to territory of the&nbsp; United States, to present any form of certificate.&nbsp; How the Collector of&nbsp; Customs of the Philippine Islands, in the Chinese Immigration Circular No. 186, as amended by Chinese Immigration&nbsp; Circular No.&nbsp; 224, provided in&nbsp; paragraph No.&nbsp; 42,&nbsp; that Chinese&nbsp; merchants residing within Philippine Islands, who desire to&nbsp; go abroad temporarily, may secure an indorsement to the effect&nbsp; that they are Chinese&nbsp; resident merchants, b leaving.&nbsp;&nbsp; This indorsement is for the purpose of facilitating their return.&nbsp; This paragraph No. 42 further provides that said merchants may return only, notwithstanding the indorsement, when they still retain the mercantile in owned by them at the time of their departure.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Acts of&nbsp; Congress have&nbsp; been&nbsp; searched in vain&nbsp; to find any&nbsp; authority&nbsp; for this&nbsp; restriction The Collector of&nbsp; Customs has&nbsp; authority&nbsp; under the&nbsp; law to make regulation for the&nbsp; due administration of the immigration&nbsp; laws.&nbsp; But he may not impose restrictions not based upon the law.&nbsp; If a resident Chinese merchandise may leave the territory of the United States and return thereto under the the administrative department of the Government can not make&nbsp; a regulation prohibiting him.&nbsp;&nbsp; This, of course, presupposes that the professional status the person has not changed from the time of his leaving until the time of return.&nbsp; The certificate which a&nbsp; resident Chinese merchant may secure be leaving the territory of the United States is only obtained for the purpose facilitating his&nbsp; entrance&nbsp; upon his&nbsp; return.&nbsp; If he was&nbsp; a merchant when went out, and there is no proof that his professional status has been changed, <em>the presumption is that&nbsp; his professional status has&nbsp; continu</em><span style="font-style: italic;">ed</span>. The&nbsp; mere fact that the&nbsp; business of a professional merchant has gone in bankruptcy does not,&nbsp; of itself, change the professional status of such p He may, by reason of business reverses, be temporarily not engaged in his actual profession; but certainly it&nbsp; can not be&nbsp; contended that bankruptcy itself would make a&nbsp; merchant a laborer. We are of the opinion that if resident Chinese is found to be a merchant when he leaves the territory of the United States, that&nbsp; he has a right to return, provided he returns within prescribed time, unless there is some&nbsp; proof showing that&nbsp; he has changed professional status of a merchant to that of a laborer.</p><p>It is our opinion that the judgment of the Court of First Instance should affirmed, and it is so ordered.</p><p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres,&nbsp; Mapa,</em> and <em>Carson, JJ</em>., concur.</p></div>
