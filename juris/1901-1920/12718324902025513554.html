				<h4>
				G.R. No. 5455, January 31, 1910</h4>
				<H3>THE  UNITED STATES,  PLAINTIFF  AND  APPELLANT,  VS.  TOMAS MOLINA, DEFENDANT AND  APPELLEE.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MORELAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The defendant was accused of a violation of section 4 of Act No.&nbsp; 610 of the Philippine&nbsp; Commission&nbsp; in that he on or about the 24th day of June, 1907, in the municipality of Solana, Province of Cagayan, not being a soldier of the Army of the United States and not being by law authorized to use or possess a firearm, was found in possession of revolver No. 160528, without a license to carry the same as provided by law.<br><br>The accused presented a demurrer to the information, alleging&nbsp; therein&nbsp; that Act No. 610, under&nbsp; which he was accused,&nbsp; had been repealed by Act No. 1780 of the Philippine&nbsp; Commission, which&nbsp; went into&nbsp; effect on the 1st day of December,&nbsp; 1907, while this&nbsp; present cause was pending. The defendant claims further that Act No.&nbsp; 1780 contains no exception with reference to&nbsp; actions pending at the time of its publication and concludes that there is no law in force under which he can be punished for the crime alleged in the complaint.<br><br>The court below sustained the demurrer and dismissed the complaint.&nbsp; From&nbsp; the order&nbsp; sustaining&nbsp; the demurrer and&nbsp; dismissing the complaint, the&nbsp; Attorney-General appealed to this court.<br><br>The case of the United States<i> vs</i>. Cuna (12 Phil. Rep., 241)&nbsp; is decisive&nbsp; of the question raised&nbsp; in&nbsp; this case.&nbsp; In that case the court held, in substance, that where an Act of the Commission or of the Philippine Legislature&nbsp; which penalizes&nbsp; an offense repeals a former Act which penalized the same offense, such repeal does not have the effect of thereafter depriving&nbsp; the&nbsp; courts&nbsp; of&nbsp; jurisdiction&nbsp; to try, convict, and sentence offenders charged with violations of the old law prior to its repeal.<br><br>The judgment of the court below is, therefore, reversed, the demurrer overruled, and the cause remanded for further proceedings.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres,&nbsp; Mapa, Johnson, Carson, </i>and <i>Elliott, JJ.</i>, concur.<br></div>
