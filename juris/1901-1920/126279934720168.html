				<H3>MARTIN  CASALLA, PLAINTIFF  AND APPELLEE, VS. EMETERIO ENAGE ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>We can not say that the findings of fact contained in the judgment of the court below are plainly and manifestly against the weight of the evidence, and the judgment based upon such findings can not, therefore, be reversed by us. (Benedicto <em>vs</em>. De la Rama, 201 U. S., 303.)</p>
<p>The court erred in admitting as evidence the books of account presented by the plaintiff.  There was nothing in them which tended to support the claim of the plaintiff, but that error could not have in any way prejudiced the defendants  (sec. 503, Code of Civil Procedure), for there was evidence in  addition  to  that  claimed to have  been presented by these books to the effect that the plaintiff received as compensation in the sawmill 300 pesos a month. The court found that he received  at least 150 pesos.  As we  have said, this finding is not so plainly and manifestly against the  evidence that we can disregard it.</p>
<p>The defendant  Claudia Mendiola was,  during the  time in controversy, the wife of the defendant Emeterio Enage. She made the contract in question with the plaintiff without the permission or authority of  her husband.  The contract related to services to  be performed by the plaintiff in connection with litigation against the husband.   This litigation related to the property of the wife which she had acquired from her first husband.  It is claimed by the appellant that the contract thus made between the wife and the  plaintiff was void because made without the permission of the husband.</p>
<p>Article 60 of the Civil Code,  upon which the plaintiff relies, is not in force in these Islands (Benedicto <em>vs</em>. De la Rama,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 2 Off. Gaz., 166); but article 49 of the Law of Civil Marriage of 1870, which was extended to  these Islands by the  royal decree of the 13th  of  April,  1883  (notes  to Spanish Civil Code, p. 12), contains substantially the same provisions as article 60 above referred to.  The property in this case being the  <em>bienes parafernales</em>,  the wife, by virtue of article 1384 of the Civil Code, had the right to administer them, and that right of administration includes the  right to  make such a  contract as that in question without the permission of her  husband.   (Judgment of  the supreme  court of Spain, November 8, 1898.)</p>
<p>The judgment of the court below is affirmed, with the costs in  this instance against the appellant.   After  the expiration  of twenty  days let  judgment be entered  in accordance herewith and ten days  thereafter the cause remanded  to  the  lower  court for proper procedure.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<em>Arellano, C. J.,</em> disqualified.<br>
