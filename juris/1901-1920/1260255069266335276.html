				<h4>
				G.R. No. 1482, February 29, 1904</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE, VS. ANTONIO FERNANDEZ, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MAPA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The guilt of the defendant of the crime of rape with which he is charged is 
fully established by the proof. The crime was committed with the aggravating 
circumstance that the accused availed himself of his position as sergeant of the 
Constabulary forces to commit the crime, and with the further circumstance of 
its commission in the dwelling of the complaining witness. Consequently the 
penalty of seventeen years four months and one day of <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion temporal</span> imposed 
on the defendant by the trial judge is in accordance with law and should 
therefore be affirmed.
<p>The court below also condemned the defendant to the payment of the sum of 500 
pesos to the father of the complaining witness. There is no authority of law for 
this, and consequently the decision can not in this respect be sustained. In 
lieu thereof the defendant should be obliged to endow the complaining witness, 
who it appears is unmarried, in the sum of 500 Philippine pesos, and to 
acknowledge and support the offspring, should there be any, in accordance with 
the provision of article 449 of the Penal Code.</p>
<p>With this modification we affirm the judgment of the court below, with the 
costs of this instance against the defendant.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Cooper,</em> and <em>McDonough, JJ.,</em> 
concur.</p>
<p><em>Willard </em>and <em>Johnson, JJ.,</em> dissent.</p>
