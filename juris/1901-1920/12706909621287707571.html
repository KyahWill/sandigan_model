				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This was an original action commenced in the Supreme Court to secure a writ of mandamus against the&nbsp; defendant to compel him, as secretary of the Visayan Electric Company, to transfer upon the books, of said company certain shares mentioned in the petition.&nbsp; The petition alleges:<br><blockquote>"That your petitioner is a resident of the city of Manila, Philippine&nbsp; Islands, but temporarily residing in the city of Shanghai, China,&nbsp; and that the respondent is a resident of and domiciled in the city of Cebu,&nbsp; Philippine Islands.<br><br>"That on January first, 1910, the respondent qualified as the secretary of the&nbsp; Visayan Electric Company, after having been duly elected, and that the defendant was on January 1, 1910, ever since has been and now is the secretary of the Visayan Electric Company,&nbsp; a corporation duly&nbsp; organized and existing under and by virtue&nbsp; of the laws of the Philippine Islands.<br><br>"That prior to&nbsp; February 5,&nbsp; 1910,&nbsp; your&nbsp; petitioner was the sole owner of one hundred shares of capital stock of&nbsp; the said&nbsp; Visayan Electric Company and among which shares were:<br><br>"Certificate No. 55 representing 5 shares;<br>"Certificate No. 62 representing 10 shares;<br>"Certificate No. 63 representing 10 shares.<br></blockquote>These certificates were issued in the name of Bryan-Landon &amp; Co. and by them indorsed to your petitioner,<br><blockquote>"That&nbsp; on February 5, 1910, your petitioner entered into an agreement with one Martin M. Levering for&nbsp; the purchase and sale from your petitioner to the said Levering of your petitioner's interest in the said Visayan Electric Company, being the one hundred shares hereinbefore mentioned and including the' 25 shares hereinbefore particularly mentioned.&nbsp; That this agreement was finally signed on February 25, 1910.<br><br>"That the aforementioned agreement between your petitioner&nbsp; and the said Levering grew out of the fact&nbsp; that certain parties among whom were Bryan-Landon &amp; Co., of which&nbsp; the respondent&nbsp; was and&nbsp; is a&nbsp; member, were&nbsp; at that time trying by various means and manipulations to get control of the said Visayan Electric Company, and the said Levering and your petitioner were desirous of preventing their thus securing control.<br><br>"That in the aforesaid agreement between your petitioner and the said Levering it was understood and agreed&nbsp; that delivery of all the stock should be made free from all incumbrances and the necessary transfers&nbsp; made on the books of the&nbsp; company.<br><br>"That the respondent does&nbsp; not question the title of your petitioner to the aforementioned shares of the said Visayan Electric Company, and that he has no&nbsp; reason to question such title,<br><br>"That the shares of the said Visayan Electric Company are transferable only&nbsp; on&nbsp; the books of the company and therefore&nbsp; your petitioner has repeatedly demanded and requested the respondent, as secretary&nbsp; of the&nbsp; said Visayan Electric Company to transfer on the books of the company the aforesaid shares, viz:<br><br>"Certificate No.&nbsp; 55 representing 5 shares;<br>"Certificate No.&nbsp; 62 representing 10 shares;<br>"Certificate No.&nbsp; 63 representing 10 shares;<br></blockquote>to the&nbsp; name&nbsp; of A.&nbsp; R. Hager, who was&nbsp; the true owner&nbsp; of same until February 5, 1910, so that the said A. R. Hager, your petitioner, may fully and faithfully carry out his agreement with the said Levering hereinbefore mentioned.<br><blockquote>"That the said Albert J. Bryan, the respondent, individually, as a member of the firm of Bryan-Landon &amp; Company, and as secretary of the said Visayan Electric&nbsp; Company has refused and&nbsp; neglected and still so refuses and neglects&nbsp; to transfer or permit the transfer of the said aforementioned shares on the books of the company in the name of your petitioner.&nbsp; That this refusal on the part of the respondent is arbitrary, malicious, and contrary to law.<br><br>"That the&nbsp; respondent as secretary of the&nbsp; said Visayan Electric Company&nbsp; is the only person whose&nbsp; duty it is to transfer shares on the books of the said company.<br><br>"That your petitioner has no plain, speedy, adequate,&nbsp; and complete remedy at law, as a&nbsp; suit in damages for the value of the shares would not be speedy, adequate, nor complete, because then&nbsp; other parties than your petitioner and Martin M. Levering&nbsp; might&nbsp; become the owners of the said shares, this being the apparent desire of the respondent and being the express condition that your petitioner desires to prevent, and being the foundation of the agreement entered into by your petitioner and the said Martin M. Levering.<br><br>"Wherefore your petitioner respectfully&nbsp; prays&nbsp; that this honorable court issue&nbsp; a&nbsp; writ of&nbsp; mandamus&nbsp; addressed to Albert J. Bryan, as secretary&nbsp; of the Visayan Electric Company ordering the said Albert J. Bryan to forthwith transfer on the books of the company to the name of your petitioner the following shares in the said Visayan Electric Coiripany, viz:<br><br>"Certificate No. 55 representing 5 shares;<br>"Certificate No. 62 representing 10 shares;<br>"Certificate No. 63 representing 10 shares.<br><br>"An order&nbsp; addressed to Albert J.&nbsp; Bryan, individually, as a member&nbsp; of the firm of Bryan-Landon &amp; Company,&nbsp; restraining the said Albert J. Bryan from in any way interfering with the transfer of the aforementioned shares on the books of the said Visayan&nbsp; Electric Company, for&nbsp; the costs&nbsp; of this&nbsp; action, together&nbsp; with such further and other relief as this honorable court may deem meet and proper and that these proceedings be expedited under section 518, Code of Civil Procedure."<br></blockquote>To&nbsp; this&nbsp; petition&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants presented the following demurrer:<br><blockquote>"Now comes the defendant in the case named above and demurs to the complaint on the ground that acts constituting cause of action are not therein alleged."<br></blockquote>The question presented is, Will the courts of the Philippine Islands, under the provisions of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions&nbsp; (sees.&nbsp; 222-225, 515) issue the writ of mandamus, under the facts&nbsp; alleged in&nbsp; the complaint, for the purpose of compelling the secretary of a private corporation to transfer stock upon the books of the corporation? <br></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">The Honorable Arthur L. Sanborn, judge of the United States district court for the western district of Wisconsin, in his article entitled "Mandamus" (26 Cy. of Law&nbsp; and Procedure (Cyc), at p. 347), said:<br><blockquote>"By the weight of authority&nbsp; mandamus will&nbsp; not lie in ordinary&nbsp; cases to compel a&nbsp; corporation or its&nbsp; officers to transfer stock on its books and issue new certificates to the transferee, since the writ (in such a case) is a purely private one, and there is generally an adequate remedy by an action against the corporation for damages."</blockquote>In support of this conclusion Judge&nbsp; Sanborn cites cases from the&nbsp; States&nbsp; as follows:<br><br><i>California.</i> -&nbsp; (Kimball <i>vs</i>. The Union Water Company, 44 Cal., 173; 13 American Reports, 157);<br><br><i>Connecticut.</i> - (Tobey <i>vs</i>. Hakes, 54 Conn., 274; 1 American State Reports, 114);<br><br><i>Georgia</i>. -&nbsp; (Terrell <i>vs</i>.&nbsp; Georgia Ry. Co., 115 Ga.,&nbsp; 104);<br><br><i>Massachusetts.</i> -&nbsp; (Stackpole <i>vs</i>.&nbsp; Seymour,&nbsp; 127&nbsp; Mass., 104);<br><br><i> Michigan. </i>- (Clark <i>vs</i>. Hill, 132 Mich., 434);<br><br><i> Minnesota</i>- - (Berker&nbsp; <i>vs</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Marshall,&nbsp; 15&nbsp; Minn.,&nbsp; [136]&nbsp; 177);<br><br><i>Missouri</i>. - (State <i>vs</i>. Rombauer,&nbsp; 46&nbsp; Mo, 155) ;<br><i><br></i>Montana. - (Durfee&nbsp; <i>vs</i>. Harper, 22 Mon., 354);<br><br><i>New Jersey.</i> -&nbsp; (Galbraith <i>vs.</i> People's Building Association etc., 43 N. J. Law, 389);<br><br><i>New York</i>. -&nbsp; (People <i><i>vs</i></i>. Miller, 114 N. Y., 636) ;<br><br><i>Ohio.</i> - (Freon <i>vs</i>. Carriage Company, 42 Ohio&nbsp; St., 30; 51 Am. Reps., 794);<br><br><i> Oregon.</i> - (Slemmons <i>vs.</i> Thompson, 23 Oregon, 215);<br><br><i> Pennsylvania. </i>-&nbsp; (Burmingham Fire Ins. Co. <i>vs</i>. Commonwealth,92 Pa. St., 72); <br><i><br></i></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><i>Rhode Island.</i> -&nbsp; (Wilkinson vs. Providence Bank, 3 R. I., 22.)<br><br>The above doctrine is the general rule in England, as well as in&nbsp; Canada.&nbsp; (Rex <i>vs</i>. London Assurance Company, 5 B. and Aid., 899).<br><br>Section&nbsp; 35, Act No. 1459, provides among other things, that:<br><blockquote>"No share&nbsp; of stock against which the&nbsp; corporation <i>holds any unpaid claim,</i> shall be transferable on the books of the corporation."<br></blockquote>To permit the writ of mandamus to issue for the purpose of compelling the officers of a corporation, in cases like the present one, to transfer stock upon&nbsp; the books of the corporation, might, under certain circumstances, require such officers to&nbsp; transfer stock against which&nbsp; the&nbsp; corporation holds unpaid&nbsp; claims. These claims might easily arise between the&nbsp; time of the issuance of the writ and the service of the same upon such officers.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the court should issue the writ, it might require an officer to transfer stock under conditions where the law expressly prohibited such transfer. The writ of mandamus will never issue to&nbsp; compel a person to violate an express provision of the law.&nbsp; The act required to be performed must be one which the law specially&nbsp; enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station or unlawfully excludes the&nbsp; plaintiff from the use and enjoyment of a&nbsp; right or office to which he is entitled and from which he is&nbsp; unlawfully precluded.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Sec. 222 of Act No. 190.)<br><br>No law has been called to our attention which specially requires the performance&nbsp; of the&nbsp; act of&nbsp; transferring the stock, while there is a law expressly prohibiting its transfer, except under certain conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Sec.&nbsp; 35, Act No. 1459.)<br><br>In the case of Tobey <i>vs.</i> Hakes (54 Conn., 274) Justice Carpenter,&nbsp; in discussing the question whether mandamus would issue or not, in an application for such writ to compel the secretary of a private corporation to transfer stock on the books of the corporation, to a purchaser,&nbsp; and to issue a certificate therefor, said:<br><blockquote>"This suit is against a private corporation, and its object is to enforce a mere private&nbsp; right.&nbsp; It is in no&nbsp; sense a proceeding to enforce the performance of a&nbsp; public duty. We have no precedent in this&nbsp; State for allowing this writ to&nbsp; compel the transfer of stock in a private&nbsp; corporation, and the authorities elsewhere are against it," - citing in support of his conclusions cases: Cushman <i>vs</i>. Thayer Manufacturing Co. (76 N. Y., 365), Town <i>vs.</i> Nichols, (73 Me., 515), State <i>vs</i>. Peoples' Building Association (43 N. J. Law, 389), Bank<i> vs</i>. Harrison (66 Ga., 696).<br></blockquote>Justice Carpenter continues&nbsp; by saying:<br><blockquote>"There is another ground on&nbsp; which the writ was properly refused.&nbsp; It is familiar law that the writ will not ordinarily issue if the plaintiff has other remedies.&nbsp; If the corporation improperly refuses to transfer the&nbsp; stock it is clearly liable for the damages in an action&nbsp; at law."<br></blockquote>In the&nbsp; case of Kimball&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Union Water&nbsp; Company&nbsp; (44 Cal., 173)&nbsp; the supreme court of California said:<br><br><blockquote>"It has been so frequently decided that a&nbsp; party entitled to stock in a private corporation has an action for damages against the corporation&nbsp; for&nbsp; the refusal of&nbsp; its officers to transfer the stock to him&nbsp; upon the company's books, that it must be considered as a settled principle of law."&nbsp;&nbsp; (King <i>vs</i>. Bank of England, 2 Douglass, 526; Shipley<i> vs.</i> Mechanics' Bank,&nbsp; 10 Johnson, 484; Wilkinson <i>vs</i>.&nbsp; Providence Bank, 3 R. L, 22; <i>Ex parte</i> Fireman's Ins. Co., 6th Hill&nbsp; (N. Y.), 243; American Asylum, etc., <i>vs</i>.&nbsp; Phoenix Bank, 4 Conn., 172; Sargeant <i> vs.</i> Franklin Ins. Co., 8 Pickering&nbsp; (Mass.), 90.)<br></blockquote><br>In the case of Shipley <i>vs.</i> Mechanics' Bank (10 Johnson, N.&nbsp; Y.,&nbsp; 484)&nbsp; an application&nbsp; was made&nbsp; for mandamus&nbsp; to compel a corporation to transfer to the&nbsp; petitioners certain stock owned by them, and in deciding the&nbsp; question, the court said:<br><blockquote>"The applicants have&nbsp; an&nbsp; adequate remedy, by special action on the case, to recover the value of the stock, if the bank have unduly refused to transfer it.&nbsp; There is no need of the <i>extraordinary remedy&nbsp; by mandamus in so ordinary a case.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; It might as well be required in every&nbsp; case in which an ordinary action would lie,"<br></blockquote>This&nbsp; court has frequently decided that mandamus, being an extraordinary remedy, will not issue when another adequate remedy exists under the ordinary procedure.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Hoey <i>vs.</i> Baldwin, 1&nbsp; Phil. Rep., 551;&nbsp; Manotoc <i>vs</i>. McMicking, 10 Phil Rep., 119; Peterson <i>vs.</i> Peterson, Case No. 2360; Cruz Herrera <i>vs</i>. McMicking, 14 Phil. Rep., 641; Tabigue et al. <i>vs</i>. Duval, 16 Phil. Rep., 324.)<br><br>For the&nbsp; reasons&nbsp; above stated the&nbsp; demurrer is&nbsp; hereby sustained and the petition is&nbsp; hereby dismissed with costs, without prejudice to the right of the plaintiff&nbsp; to commence an ordinary&nbsp; action&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; to secure an order directing&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant to&nbsp; transfer the stock in question upon&nbsp; the&nbsp; books of the company, after it is alleged and proved that the corporation holds no&nbsp; unpaid claims against it.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J</i>., and <i>Torres, J.</i>, concur.<br><br><i> <i>Mapa, J.</i>, concurs in the result.<br><br>Moreland,&nbsp; J.,</i> with whom concur Carson&nbsp; and <i>Trent, JJ., </i>dissenting:<br><br>I dissent.&nbsp; I am of the opinion that mandamus&nbsp; ought to issue&nbsp; in this case.<br></div>
