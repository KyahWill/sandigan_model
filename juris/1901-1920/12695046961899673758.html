Burritt, judge of the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of the Province of Cebu.</p><p>Judgment <em>should be affirmed</em>.</p><p>This was an action against the defendants for the return of sixty-five logs,&nbsp; or their value,&nbsp; estimated at P1,250 and damages estimated at P225 and costs.</p><p>On the 9th of&nbsp; May, 1905, the plaintiff&nbsp; presented&nbsp; the following complaint:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"The plaintiff sets forth:&nbsp; </p><p>"1. That, in the month of March, 1905, the plaintiff was the owner of sixty-five&nbsp; logs or pieces of timber, deposited on the beach of&nbsp; the city of Cebu. </p><p>"2. That on the said date the&nbsp; defendant, Juan Climaco, was the governor and&nbsp; sheriff, duly elected, and qualified, of the Province of Cebu and is&nbsp; still, at the present time, such&nbsp; governor and sheriff.&nbsp; </p><p>"3. That in the same month of March, 1906 [1905], the defendant,&nbsp; Tan&nbsp; Bun&nbsp; Jua, was the plaintiff in a civil case then&nbsp; pending in&nbsp; the municipal&nbsp; court&nbsp; of Cebu, in which case one&nbsp; Manuel Chiong Tiqui was the&nbsp; defendant, and in the same month judgment was rendered in favor of the said plaintiff against the said Manuel Chiong Tiqui for a sum of more than P400.&nbsp; </p><p>"4. In&nbsp; the same month&nbsp; of March, 1905, the defendant, Juan Climaco, in&nbsp; his capacity of governor and sheriff of the Province&nbsp; of Cebu,&nbsp; sold&nbsp; the plaintiff's aforementioned logs to&nbsp; the defendant, Diego Cabrera.&nbsp; </p><p>"5. That&nbsp; said&nbsp; sale&nbsp; was&nbsp; held&nbsp; without&nbsp; the formalities required by law and at public auction in the office of the clerk of&nbsp; this&nbsp; court; that&nbsp; said&nbsp; sale was illegal and was effected at the petition and instigation&nbsp; of the&nbsp; defendant, Tan Bun Jua,&nbsp; under the pretext of complying with the writ of execution issued by the justice of the peace of the municipality of Cebu, in the case aforementioned.&nbsp; </p><p>"6, That said sale was null and illegal and the plaintiff has been injured thereby in the sum of P250.&nbsp; </p><p>"7. That the value of the&nbsp; said logs, sold&nbsp; as aforestated, was Pl,250.</p><p>"8. That the defendant,&nbsp; Diego Cabrera,&nbsp; took possession of the said logs on the same&nbsp; date of the sale and up to the present time still retains possession of them and unlawfully refuses&nbsp; to deliver&nbsp; them to the plaintiff,&nbsp; who is their true owner.</p><p>"9. That, by reason of the illegal acts&nbsp; of the defendants before named,&nbsp; the plaintiff&nbsp; has suffered injury and damage in the amount of P225.</p><p>"10.&nbsp; That, therefore, the plaintiff asks that judgment be rendered against the defendants for the return of the sixty-five logs aforementioned, or, in case it be impossible to return them that the defendants be sentenced to pay the sum of Pi,250&nbsp; as an&nbsp; indemnity, the sum of P225 as losses and damages,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; costs&nbsp; of the&nbsp; trial; and for any further remedy&nbsp; that justice may require."</p></blockquote><p>On the 19th of May, 1905, the plaintiff amended the&nbsp; foregoing complaint, as follows:</p><blockquote><p>"The&nbsp; plaintiff sets forth:</p><p>"1. That he ratifies his previous complaint in all its parts, except the allegation&nbsp; that the said timbers are now in the possession of the defendant Diego&nbsp; Cabrera, and&nbsp; further alleges:</p><p>"That,&nbsp; on May 1,&nbsp; 1905, the defendant Diego&nbsp; Cabrera illegally sold and transferred the logs described in the complaint, to the defendant, the Chinaman&nbsp; Quina, who now has&nbsp; them and unlawfully&nbsp; refuses to deliver them to the plaintiff.</p><p>"Therefore, the plaintiff prays that judgment be rendered against the&nbsp; defendants for the return of the&nbsp; 65 logs aforementioned, or, in case it be impossible to return them, that the defendant be sentenced to pay&nbsp; the sum of P1,250 as an indemnity, the sum of P225 as losses and damages, and the costs&nbsp; of the trial;&nbsp; and for any further remedy that justice may require."</p></blockquote><p>On the 10th&nbsp; of&nbsp; November,&nbsp; 1905, the&nbsp; defendant,&nbsp; Juan Climaco, filed the following answer:</p><blockquote><p>"Juan&nbsp; Climaco, one&nbsp; of the&nbsp; defendants&nbsp; in the above-entitled case, in answer to the complaint filed therein, denies each and&nbsp; all of the allegations&nbsp; contained therein,&nbsp; and, as his special defense, alleges:</p><p>"That,&nbsp; as governor of the Province&nbsp; of Cebu, he is the chief executive officer of the courts of the justices of the peace of the said province,&nbsp; in accordance with Act No. 136, and, as such&nbsp; officer,&nbsp; duly&nbsp; officiated&nbsp; in the&nbsp; case&nbsp; in which Tan Bunjua is the plaintiff and Chiong Tiqui the defendant, in compliance with a writ of execution addressed to him by&nbsp; the&nbsp; justice of the peace&nbsp; of the&nbsp; municipality of Cebu, which writ&nbsp; was&nbsp; and&nbsp; is&nbsp; authentic and&nbsp; legal, as shown by the&nbsp; attached copy thereof, marked&nbsp; Exhibit A;&nbsp; and that the proceedings carried out by the defendant Juan Climaco, as governor of Cebu, and&nbsp; by his authorized deputies, are legal and are within&nbsp; the said defendant's powers&nbsp; as such chief executive officer.</p><p>"Therefore, he respectfully&nbsp; prays the&nbsp; court to&nbsp; absolve him from the complaint, with the costs against the plaintiff."</p></blockquote><p>Exhibit A, to which reference is made in the answer of the defendant, is as follows:</p><blockquote><p align="center"> "EXHIBIT A,</p><p align="center"> "WRIT OP EXECUTION,</p><blockquote><p><em>"To the governor of the Province of Cebu and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Now, they are in the&nbsp; same sitio.&nbsp; The timbers remained in the same place where they were delivered to me at Lutag from the month of August,&nbsp; 1904, up until sometime in the month of April or May, 1905, when upon passing through the sitio&nbsp; of Lutag where the timbers were deposited I found&nbsp; several laborers at work&nbsp; on these timbers.&nbsp; Upon inquiring of them what they were doing and why they were working&nbsp; on&nbsp; those timbers, they informed me that they were taking the timbers away by&nbsp; order of Juan Quina.&nbsp; I asked them 'why they were taking my timbers away;' and they answered, 'because the&nbsp; Chinaman Juan Quina had bought&nbsp; them from Diego Cabrera.' I then called up the Chinaman&nbsp; Manuel Cheong Tique for an explanation, and Cheong Tique was&nbsp; ignorant of the matter and could give me no&nbsp; explanation.

In the month of May of the year 1904, in the city of Cebu.</p><p>"Q. According to that contract, who was&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay the forestry tax ? - A.&nbsp; The&nbsp; agreement&nbsp; with the&nbsp; Chinaman Cheong Tique was: When the timbers should arrive from Dapitan, Mindanao, I was to&nbsp; pay him at the&nbsp; rate&nbsp; of ten pesos per piece, deducting therefrom the amount of the forestry tax which it was my obligation to pay according to the contract, depositing an amount to secure the payment of the forestry&nbsp; tax; which was carried into effect. The contract was made in the month of May and the Chinaman Cheong Tique went to Dapitan with the lorcha <em>Prudencia</em> for the purpose of bringing the timbers to Cebu, returning with them&nbsp; in&nbsp; the first days of August when the&nbsp; contract was carried into effect.</p><p>"Q.

When you bought this lumber and placed it there, did you not place a man in&nbsp; charge of it to look after it? -&nbsp; A.

They were situated in the same place as that described by the last witness; with the exception&nbsp; that there were&nbsp; other timbers there that were not marked C. <br>Q. and those that were seized by me under the writ of attachment bore an additional mark of 'Sheriff.'&nbsp; I placed the mark of 'Sheriff' upon them with Chinese red paint.</p><p>"Q. <em>Where was the public&nbsp; auction held? </em>- A. <em>It was celebrated in the office of the deputy sheriff of the provincial governor in the office&nbsp; of the court in the&nbsp; absence of the property.</em></p><p>"Q. <em> Did&nbsp; you bring&nbsp; the&nbsp; timbers&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; government house?</em> - A.&nbsp; <em>No, sir; it was impossible to bring&nbsp; the timbers. They were very large timbers; so large that they could not be moved without the aid of machinery."</em></p><p>Quintin Cheong was called for the plaintiff and testified as follows:</p><p>"Q. What is&nbsp; your name? - A, Quintin Cheong.</p><p>"Q. Where do you live? - A. In Cebu.</p><p>"Q. How old are you? - A.&nbsp; Thirty-six.</p><p>"Q. What is&nbsp; your occupation? - A. I am a merchant.</p><p>"Q. What business were you engaged&nbsp; in&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; year 1904? - A. I was at the&nbsp; head of&nbsp; a soap&nbsp; establishment;&nbsp; a soap factory.</p><p>"Q.<em> Do you know Nicolas Arbotante</em>, the plaintiff in this case? - A.<em> Yes,&nbsp; sir; I know him.</em></p><p>"Q. <em>Do you know the Chinaman, Manuel Cheong Tique?</em> - A. <em>Yes, sir; I know him.</em></p><p>"Q. Did you have any business relations with this Chinaman in&nbsp; the year 1904? - A. He was a partner&nbsp; in business with me.</p><p>"Q. In a soap factory? - A. Yes,&nbsp; sir.</p><p>"Q. In&nbsp; the year&nbsp; 1904,&nbsp; did you hear any conversation between&nbsp; the&nbsp; Chinaman&nbsp; Manuel&nbsp; Cheong Tique&nbsp; and&nbsp; the plaintiff, Nicolas Arbotante, about some timbers? - A. Yes, sir; I did.</p><p>"Q. When? - A.&nbsp; In the month of May;&nbsp; I do&nbsp; not remember the date.</p><p>"Q. What was said by them in that conversation at that time? - A. They talked&nbsp; about&nbsp; lumber.</p><p>"Q.&nbsp; State all that was said, to the&nbsp; best of your recollection. - A. I heard Nicolas Arbotante say that he wanted to buy lumber.</p><p>"Q.&nbsp; Do you know&nbsp; whether&nbsp; or not Nicolas Arbotante bought any lumber from the&nbsp; Chinaman&nbsp; Manuel&nbsp; Cheong Tique in the year 1904? - A. Yes, sir; I know that he did.</p><p>"Q. Where were the timbers deposited? - A. In the sitio of Lutag.</p><p>"Q.&nbsp; Do you know how much lumber;&nbsp; how many timbers? - A. There were one hundred and sixty&nbsp; pieces."</p></blockquote><p>During the trial the&nbsp; plaintiff offered&nbsp; in&nbsp; evidence the record in case No.&nbsp; 305&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Cebu, in which Manuel Cheong Tique was plaintiff and Tan Bunjua and Juan&nbsp; Climaco were defendants.&nbsp;&nbsp; Said record was admitted&nbsp; without objection.</p><p>From said&nbsp; record (No. 305)&nbsp; it appears that on the 15th of April, 1905, the plaintiff, Manuel Cheong Tique, who had been the defendant&nbsp; in the action upon which the execution in question was issued (the case of Tan Bunjua vs. Manuel Cheong Tique), commenced an&nbsp; action against Tan Bunjua and Juan Climaco for the purpose of having the&nbsp; judgment in the case of Tan Bunjua vs. Manuel Cheong Tique declared null and void, for the reason that he, Manuel Cheong Tique, had not been duly notified&nbsp; of the existence of said action and that said judgment&nbsp; was rendered against him without a hearing.&nbsp; The plaintiff, Manuel Cheong Tique also prayed that said sentence and execution be declared null and&nbsp; void. In this action&nbsp; (case No.&nbsp; 305) the defendant, Juan Climaco, made no appearance.</p><p>After hearing the evidence adduced during the trial, in cause&nbsp; No. 305 the lower court rendered&nbsp; a judgment decreeing that the sentence dictated&nbsp; by the justice of the peace, in the case of Tan&nbsp; Banjua vs.&nbsp; Manuel Cheong Tique was null and void and&nbsp; that the execution&nbsp; issued thereon,&nbsp; on the 25th of March,&nbsp; 1905, was&nbsp; also null and void; and the court issued an order restraining the sheriff, Juan Climaco, and his deputies, from executing the said execution.</p><p>It was stipulated by the plaintiff and the defendants that Exhibit A, attached to the answer&nbsp; of the defendant, Juan Climaco, correctly stated the facts relating to the execution and sale of the logs in question, as well as the return of the sheriff made in relation&nbsp; to the said sale.</p><p>From the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause the following facts were fully proven and are not disputed:</p><p>First.&nbsp; That&nbsp; the&nbsp; auxiliary&nbsp; justice of the&nbsp; peace of the municipality of Cebu, on the&nbsp; 14th&nbsp; of March, 1905, in&nbsp; an action then&nbsp; pending between. Tan&nbsp; Bunjua, plaintiff, <em>vs</em>. Manuel Cheong Tique, defendant, rendered a judgment in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of P498 with costs.</p><p>Second. That on the 25th of March, 1905, an execution was issued upon said judgment and was placed in the hands of the sheriff&nbsp; of&nbsp; said province, who, upon the&nbsp; 30th&nbsp; of March, levied upon the sixty-five logs which he found deposited in McClernand Street in the city of Cebu, which logs were&nbsp; sold at public auction in the office of the sheriff upon the 10th of April, 1905.</p><p>Third. That&nbsp; the sixty-five&nbsp; logs in question belonged to and were owned by Nicolas Arbotante.</p><p>Fourth, That the said&nbsp; Nicolas Arbotante who&nbsp; owned the said sixty-five&nbsp; logs,&nbsp; had&nbsp; no notice whatever of&nbsp; either the pendency&nbsp; of the action between&nbsp; Tan Bunjua and&nbsp; Manuel Cheong Tique,&nbsp; nor of the attachment or&nbsp; sale of the said sixty-five&nbsp; logs&nbsp; by&nbsp; the said sheriff,&nbsp; which sale took place in the office of&nbsp; the sheriff upon the 10th of April, 1905.</p><p>Fifth.&nbsp; That&nbsp; the judgment of&nbsp; the justice&nbsp; of&nbsp; the peace rendered in the cause of Tan Bunjua vs. Manuel Cheong Tique was declared null and void by the judge of the Court of First Instance of the Province of&nbsp; Cebu in an action (No. 305)&nbsp; commenced for that&nbsp; purpose&nbsp; on the 15th&nbsp; of April, 1905,&nbsp; which action&nbsp; (No. 305) was entitled Manuel Cheong Tique vs. Tan Bunjua and Juan Climaco, sheriff.&nbsp; The basis of this&nbsp; action&nbsp; was the fact that the defendant, Manuel Cheong&nbsp; Tique,&nbsp; had not been given a hearing in the cause of Tan Bunjua <em>vs.</em> Manuel Cheong Tique.&nbsp; Said action (305) was based upon the provisions of section 113 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions.&nbsp; Said section&nbsp; 113 provides:</p><p><em>"Sec. 113. Relief from effect of judgments&nbsp; and orders.</em> - Upon such terms as may be just the&nbsp; court may relieve a party or his legal representative from a judgment, order, or other proceedings taken against him through mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect: Provided, That application therefor be made within a&nbsp; <em>reasonable time, but in no case exceeding six months</em> after such judgment, order, or proceeding was taken."</p><p>The judgment in question was rendered by the justice of the peace upon the 14th of March, 1905.&nbsp; The action (305) declaring null such judgment, was&nbsp; commenced on the 15th of April, 1905.</p><p>Sixth. In the action (305)&nbsp; the court not&nbsp; only declared that the judgment&nbsp; of&nbsp; the justice of the peace&nbsp; in the case of Tan Bunjua <em>vs</em>. Manuel&nbsp; Cheong Tique was null&nbsp; and void, but also&nbsp; declared that the execution issued thereon was null and void.</p><p>From&nbsp; the foregoing facts we have the following conclusions :</p><p>That&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; herein, Juan Climaco, as sheriff of the Province of Cebu,&nbsp; by virtue of authority of a writ of execution which was declared to be null&nbsp; and void,&nbsp; issued upon a judgment of the justice of the peace, which has also been declared null&nbsp; and void, levied upon property of the plaintiff, Nicolas Arbotante, and sold the same&nbsp; without his (Arbotante's) having had any notice whatever of said execution and sale.</p><p>With&nbsp; reference to the first above assignment of error, the&nbsp; plaintiff proved beyond any peradventure of&nbsp; doubt that the said sixty-five logs belonged to him.&nbsp; The defendant presented no proof whatever even tending to show that the logs were not the property of the plaintiff.</p><p>Under the&nbsp; second assignment&nbsp; of error, the appellant attempts to&nbsp; show that&nbsp; by reason of the fact that he levied upon the logs in question and sold them under an execution issued by the justice of the peace,&nbsp; that he was acting in a judicial capacity.&nbsp; This&nbsp; contention can not be admitted, but even if&nbsp; it were admitted, even then it would&nbsp; not be authority for the sheriff&nbsp; to sell&nbsp; the&nbsp; property&nbsp; of&nbsp; a third person.&nbsp; The execution&nbsp; commanded the&nbsp; sheriff to attach sufficient personal property belonging to&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant, Manuel Cheong Tique, to satisfy said judgment. The execution afforded the defendant&nbsp; (the sheriff)&nbsp; no authority whatever to attach the property of another person,&nbsp; and when he attached the property of a third person, he violated the provisions of his order (the execution).&nbsp;&nbsp; The execution only afforded him protection when he complied with its terms, to wit,&nbsp; to levy&nbsp; upon the&nbsp; property&nbsp; of the&nbsp; persons mentioned therein.</p><p>With reference to the&nbsp; third assignment of&nbsp; error,&nbsp; the defendant and&nbsp; appellant contends that his&nbsp; acts in&nbsp; levying upon and selling the logs in question were legal and valid. This&nbsp; contention&nbsp; certainly&nbsp; can not be&nbsp; maintained.&nbsp; The plaintiff herein, the owner of the logs&nbsp; in question, had had no&nbsp; hearing whatever with reference to the said sale.&nbsp;&nbsp; He had no notice of the execution&nbsp; and sale.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was deprived of his property without due process of law.</p><p>Under the&nbsp; fourth assignment of error, the defendant and appellant (the sheriff) contends that inasmuch as the&nbsp; execution&nbsp; was levied&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the logs in question, and the same were sold by him in good faith, he should be relieved from all responsibility;&nbsp; in other words, the effect of the&nbsp; contention of the defendant and appellant (the sheriff)&nbsp; is&nbsp; that under a writ of execution issued by the court he may&nbsp; levy upon the property of any&nbsp; person&nbsp; whatsoever, and sell the same, without incurring any responsibility, so long as he acts in good faith.&nbsp; The lack of good faith is a fact difficult to prove.&nbsp; The execution was issued to the sheriff&nbsp; and he was directed&nbsp; to levy upon&nbsp; the property of Manuel Cheong Tique.&nbsp;&nbsp; He did&nbsp; not obey that order.&nbsp; Instead&nbsp; of levying upon the property of Manuel Cheong Tique, he levied upon and sold the property of&nbsp; Nicolas Arbotante.&nbsp; To&nbsp; sustain the&nbsp; good faith which he claims he exercised in said&nbsp; execution and sale he made no effort to show that he had made the slightest inquiry of the people living in and about the place where the&nbsp; logs were deposited, for the purpose of ascertaining who the real owner of the logs was.&nbsp; Certainly a sheriff in the execution of a&nbsp; writ of execution can claim no protection under said&nbsp; writ&nbsp; of execution,&nbsp; unless he can show that he obeyed its&nbsp; orders.&nbsp; In the&nbsp; present case he makes no pretense of having obeyed the writ of execution.</p><p>An execution is an order to the sheriff to attach and sell the property of the judgment debtor.&nbsp; If he sells the property of another he is not obeying the&nbsp; order of the court.</p><p>The officer&nbsp; has no authority to attach&nbsp; the property of any person except that of the defendant&nbsp; (judgment debtor). If he does so the writ affords him no justification, for the act is not in obedience&nbsp; to its&nbsp; mandate.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Rhodes&nbsp; <em>vs</em>. Patterson,&nbsp; 3 Cal, 469;&nbsp; Van Pelt <em>vs.</em> Littler,&nbsp; 14&nbsp; Cal.,&nbsp; 194; Sanderson <em>vs</em>. Baker, 3 Wils., 309; State <em>vs</em>. Moore, 19 Mo., 369; Harris<em> vs.</em> Hanson, 11 Maine, 241; People <em>vs</em>. Schuyler, 4 N. Y., 173; State <em>vs</em>. Talom, 69 N. C,&nbsp; 35.)</p><p>If the sheriff takes the property of a third person he is entitled to no indulgence.&nbsp; The sheriff having misapplied his process, whether by mistake or design,&nbsp; will make no difference.&nbsp; He stands in the position of every trespasser and is&nbsp; liable&nbsp; to&nbsp; an action&nbsp; in&nbsp; the instant the trespass&nbsp; is committed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The circumstance that the property was in the possession of the execution&nbsp; debtor at the date of the judgment, amounts to nothing except&nbsp; proof of fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Boulware <em>vs</em>. Craddock, 30 Cal, 190; Vose <em>vs.</em> Stickney, 8&nbsp; Minn., 51; Dodge <em>vs.</em> Chandler, 9 Minn.,&nbsp; 87; Rankin <em>vs</em>.&nbsp; Ekel, 64 Cal., 446.)</p><p>The owner whose property has been&nbsp; taken under&nbsp; a writ of attachment, to which he&nbsp; was not a party,&nbsp; has his choice of remedies.&nbsp; He may sue in trespass or for the&nbsp; recovery of the property.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Yarborough <em>vs</em>. Harper, 32 Miss., 112; Gimble <em>vs</em>. Acklex, 12 Iowa, 27.)</p><p>In the case of Forsythe <em>vs.</em> Ellis (4 J. J. Marshall&nbsp; (Ky.), 298)&nbsp; the chief justice, speaking for the court, said:</p><p>"The reason why the sheriff is responsible to the owner is a very comprehensive one and applies to all persons who take the property&nbsp; of others&nbsp; without any&nbsp; authority.&nbsp; An execution against the goods of A gives no authority to the sheriff to take the goods of B.&nbsp; So long as the officer confines his acts to the authority&nbsp; of the process he is irresponsible, but all acts which are not justified by the writ are, of course, without&nbsp; authority&nbsp; of law.&nbsp; The inevitable consequence, therefore, of the principle that no man shall touch the property of another without the permission of the owner or the sanction&nbsp; of&nbsp; the law, is that no&nbsp; plea of&nbsp; exemption or station, however exalted or consecrated, can exonerate a trespasser.&nbsp; This&nbsp; principle&nbsp; is conservative of property. Without its&nbsp; integrity and universality, private rights would be insecure&nbsp; and the law would be unequal and tyrannical. The sovereign power of the State, with its 'eminent domain' can not take&nbsp; from the humblest citizen a particle of his property for public&nbsp; use, without allowing him a just compensation.</p><blockquote><p>"If an execution against one man would excuse&nbsp; the sheriff for taking and selling the property of another, every citizen would be at his mercy and none could&nbsp; call his&nbsp; estate his own.&nbsp;&nbsp; As the execution gives the sheriff no authority,&nbsp; he has none, and&nbsp; therefore his sale neither devises nor confers any rights.&nbsp; The owner of the property, therefore, sold&nbsp; by the sheriff without authority,&nbsp; may recover from the sheriff its value in&nbsp; an action of trespass."</p></blockquote><p>Mr. Harlow, in&nbsp; his work on the liability of sheriffs,&nbsp; at section 562, says:</p><blockquote><p>"An officer&nbsp; is liable to the owner of personal property for the seizure and sale thereof under an execution against a third party, and he is not relieved from liability by professing&nbsp; to sell only the 'right, title and interest' of the defendant."</p></blockquote><p>In the case&nbsp; of Boulware <em>vs</em>. Craddock (30 Cal., 190) the court said:</p><blockquote><p>"If the sheriff, by virtue of&nbsp; an execution, seizes the property&nbsp; of a person other than the judgment debtor, whether by mistake or design, it is not necessary for the owner of the property thus seized to make a demand on the sheriff before commencing suit."</p></blockquote><p>The defense is made for the defendant here (he does not make it for himself)&nbsp; that under section&nbsp; 451 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions,&nbsp; he is not liable, even&nbsp; though he levies upon and sells the property of a third person, unless such third person should give him notice in writing and lay claim to the property which is being sold.&nbsp; We can not agree that said&nbsp; section 451&nbsp; is subject to any such interpretation. We do not believe that section 451 was intended to&nbsp; protect a sheriff&nbsp; from all responsibility&nbsp; whatever where he sells the property of a third&nbsp; person under a writ of execution, where such third person fails to give him notice that the property being sold belongs to him.&nbsp; If that is the&nbsp; correct interpretation of said section 451, then we contend that that provision&nbsp; of said section is absolutely void under the provisions of the Philippine Bill, which provides that persons shall not be deprived&nbsp; of their property without due process of law.&nbsp; It being admitted in the present case that the property belonged to Nicolas Arbotante and that it was sold without his knowledge or consent, or without the slightest notice that the same was being&nbsp; levied upon and sold, <em>we hold,&nbsp; that to justify the sheriff in said&nbsp; sale and to relieve him from all responsibility whatever, would constitute one of the most flagrant cases of depriving a man of his property without due process&nbsp; of law&nbsp; which could possibly come to the attention of the court.</em></p><p>The defendant and&nbsp; appellant makes no claim that section 451 of the Code of Procedure in&nbsp; Civil Actions relieves him of all responsibility.&nbsp;&nbsp; The defense is made for him.</p><p>Section&nbsp; 451 is taken from&nbsp; section 689 of the&nbsp; California Code.&nbsp; So far as we have been able to discover the supreme court of California has not interpreted said section (689). In ttie case of Black <em>vs.</em> Clasby (97 Cal., 482) the supreme court of California referred to said section (689) but refused to discuss the effect of the same, for the reason that the action in that case arose prior to the time of the enactment of said provision.&nbsp;&nbsp; In that case, as they had done in many others, the supreme court of California said:</p><p>"When the sheriff, under a writ of attachment,&nbsp; or of execution&nbsp; against one&nbsp; person,&nbsp; seizes&nbsp; the&nbsp; goods of&nbsp; another, which at the time of the seizure are in the custody&nbsp; either of the owner, or of a person other than the defendant in the writ, he is a trespasser ab initio% and no previous demand is necessary to authorize the recovery therefor."</p><p>In the case of Lammon <em>vs</em>. Feusier (111 U. S., 17) Mr. Justice Gray, speaking for the Supreme Court&nbsp; of the United States said:</p><p>"The marshall&nbsp; (the officer corresponding to the sheriff), in serving a writ of attachment on&nbsp; mesne process, which directs him to take the property of a particular person, acts officially.&nbsp; His official duty is to take the property of that person, and of that person only; and to take only such property&nbsp; of his as is&nbsp; subject to be&nbsp; attached, and&nbsp; not&nbsp; property exempt&nbsp; by law from attachment.&nbsp;&nbsp; A neglect to&nbsp; take the attachable property of that person, and a taking,&nbsp; upon the writ, of&nbsp; the property&nbsp; of another person&nbsp; or&nbsp; of&nbsp; property exempt from attachment, are&nbsp; equally breaches of his official duty.&nbsp; The taking of the attachable property&nbsp; of the person named in the writ is rightful; the taking of the&nbsp; property of another person is wrongful&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *.</p><p>"A person other than the defendant named in&nbsp; the writ, whose property is wrongfully taken, may,&nbsp; indeed, sue the marshall, like any other wrongdoer, in an action of&nbsp; trespass, to recover damages for the wrongful taking; and neither the official&nbsp; character&nbsp; of the marshall, nor the&nbsp; writ of attachment, affords him any&nbsp; defense to such action.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Day <em>vs</em>. Gallup, 2 Wall., 97; Buck <em>vs.</em> Colbatch, 3 Wall., 334.)"</p><p>For all of the&nbsp; foregoing reasons, basing our judgment upon the facts&nbsp; and the&nbsp; law, we are of the opinion and so hold that the judgment of the lower court should be affirmed with costs.</p></div>
