				G.R. No. 947, November 04, 1902</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE, VS. DONATO SALANDANAN ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.
  
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MAPA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> The record discloses the fact, established not only by the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution, but also by the confession of the defendant Mendigoren, that Igncio Lopez and Alvaro Bruno were  kidnaped on the afternoon of the 5th of November, 1901, and were held under the control of the defendants, who were members of a band of malefactors,  until the  night of the 7th of the same month, when they succeeded  in recovering their liberty, by force, with the help of Catalino Pangilinan.  The other defendant, Salandanan, has also acknowledged by implication the truth of the facts charged in the information, but has  endeavored to excuse himself by alleging, without proving his statements, that although he accompanied the persons who committed the crime,  and was  armed  with a gun, it  was because he also had been kidnaped.<br>
  <br>
  These  facts constitute the  crime of  illegal detention, defined and punished by article 481 of the Penal  Code. The judge below so  held  correctly, and condemned the defendants to eight years and  one  day of prisidn mayor, not applying any circumstance in mitigation of the responsibility arising  from the commission of the  crime prosecuted.</p>
<p> The defense in this instance admits that the guilt of the defendants is disclosed by the record,  but contends for them as a mitigating circumstance,  in the first place, the loss of self-control which, it is alleged, was  naturally produced with respect to both of them by reasons of the suspicion they entertained that the injured parties were members of the secret police.  There is nothing in the record to justify such an  assertion,  and this alone is sufficient to demonstrate, without the necessity of further consideration, the inadmissibility of such contention.  It is absolutely necessary, in order to consider the concurrence' in the commission of a crime of the mitigating circumstance invoked by the defense, that the record contain proof of the causes which are supposed to have produced  such powerful excitement as to overcome reason and self-control.</p>
<p>Counsel for the defense also invokes the circumstance of race, established by article 11 of the Penal Code.  This circumstance is not necessarily mitigating. It rests in the discretion of the courts to apply it in mitigation or aggravation according to the special circumstances of each case. In the  present case no reason can be found which would lead  us to apply this  circumstance as a ground for  the mitigation of the penalty in favor of the defendants. The judgment of the court below  is therefore affirmed, with the  costs of this instance  to  the defendants.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano,  C.  J.,  Torres, Cooper, Smith, Willard,</em> and <em>Ladd, JJ., </em>concur.</p>
