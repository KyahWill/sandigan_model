				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE, VS. MAMERTO VARGAS ET. AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Simeon  Alberto on  May 20, 11)02,  was attacked and severely wounded.   To the persons who went to his assistance he stated that the defendants had assaulted him.   He said nothing of the motive.  He died the next day.   There was no other evidence for the Government.  Manalastas was acquitted by the court below.   The defendant  Vargas testified that, on returning to his house on the day in question, he found Alberto lying with his  (the  defendant's) wife; that he drew his bolo; Alberto escaped through the window; that he, the defendant, pursued him, overtook him, and killed  him.  There  was evidence that the relations existing between Alberto and the wife of the defendant had been the subject of common talk in the barrio.</p>
<p>The judge  below apparently  believed the testimony of the defendant, but, being of the  opinion that article  423 of the Penal Code was not applicable, sentenced the defendant to eight years of <em>prision mayor</em>.</p>
<p>We agree with the court as to  the facts, but not as to the application of said article 423.</p>
<p>This  article  fixes the  penalty  of <em> destierro </em> when the husband kills the offender "in the act."   In this  case the discovery, the escape, the pursuit, and the killing  were all parts of one continuous act.</p>
<p>The judgment of the  court below is reversed,  and the defendant Vargas is condemned to the penalty of <em>destierro</em> for the term  of two years four months and one day, to pay  the heirs of the deceased 1,000 pesos, and  in case of insolvency to subsidiary <em>destierro</em> for a  term which can not exceed one-third of the above penalty, he being prohibited  from entering in  a  radius of 25  kilometers from the barrio of Santa Monica, in the pueblo of Floridablanca, in the Province of Pampanga, during the term aforesaid, with costs to the appellant.</p>
<p><em> Arellano, C. J., Torres, Cooper, Mapa,</em> and <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em>McDonough, J.,</em> did not sit in this case.<br>
