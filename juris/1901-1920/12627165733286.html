				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The defendants  in this case were  charged  with the robbery of certain jewels of the value of 11,185.50 pesetas, and convicted thereof in the Court of First  Instance, the defendant Alcantara as principal and the defendant Nisayas as an accessory after the fact.  The former was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment  (<span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span style="font-style: italic;">prision mayor</span>) and the latter to pay a fine of  750 pesetas.  The  defendant Nisayas did not appeal.  Her codefendant,  however, did appeal.  Two separate complaints were presented successively for the same act charged in this case.  In  the first complaint the defendants were charged  with  theft.  It does not appear clearly from the record what the  outcome was of the prosecution instituted upon the first-mentioned complaint.  The appellant in this case alleged in the Court of First Instance that she had been placed twice in jeopardy for  the reason that she had been acquitted in the former  trial, but failed to present the necessary proof in support of  her  allegation, and  relied upon  the fact that such acquittal appeared  from the record in the other case. The court below, in discussing this point, merely says that the  crime of theft is entirely different and  distinct from the crime of robbery, and consequently that the defendants in  this case can not set up the  defense  of having  been placed twice in  jeopardy.  With nothing except what we have now before us  we can not determine with certainty whether this is one of the cases covered by the provisions of sections  27 or 28 of General Orders, No. 58.  This of itself, without the necessity of passing upon  the merits of the questions of law involved in  the aforesaid plea of jeopardy, perhaps,  would be  sufficient to overrule such plea, the defendant having failed  to  support her  allegation  of a former acquittal if the merits of the present case did not make it unnecessary to make an express declaration upon this point.</p>
<p>The complaining witness in this case was  the owner of a jewelry store  on Calle Rosario of this  city;  she lived in Calle Soler,   Her custom was to take the  jewels to the store in the morning and to take  them back  to her house at night.   For this purpose she had employed  a clerk  who had been in her  employ for seven years.  On the morning of the 29th of July, 1904, this  clerk took the jewels, as usual, in  order  to carry them to her place of business, while the owner was in church attending mass.  These jewels were contained in two small boxes locked with keys. The jewels did not reach the store, the clerk having lost them  on the way.  The fact was reported to the authorities, who, on the evening of the same day, found the said jewelry in the possession of the defendant, the  boxes in which the jewels had been  contained having been broken open.</p>
<p>As to the manner in which the clerk of the complaining witness lost possession of the property in question, it seems that there was no other eyewitness than the clerk himself, who, by the way, was not called as a witness in this case. The only evidence of record in regard to this matter is the testimony of the complaining witness herself, who testified as to what she had heard from the clerk.  She testified that. she met her clerk hurrying by the  church about  8 o'clock in the morning,  inquired from him as to the whereabouts of the jewels, and that he informed her that the appellant, who had been a servant in the house of the complaining witness for two days under the name of Francisca, had taken them  away.  After this we find in  the testimony of the complaining witness the following  questions and answers:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Q. Where did Francisco Llamoso (the clerk) tell you that that woman (the appellant) had taken the jewel boxes away from him?—A. In Calle Misericordia  in the store of a Chinaman.  He said it was raining,  and that the girl told him to put the boxes inside the Chinaman's  store.</p>
  <p>"Q. Did Francisco explain to you  how she (the girl) took possession  of the boxes?—A.  When Francisco went out with  the two  boxes she followed  him  and  told him that she was going to sell  something; that the  lady had gone  out calling,  and  as I have said before, when  they arrived at a Chinaman's store she told him,  as it was raining, to put the two boxes inside the Chinaman's store, and at the same time asked Francisco to go and buy some pineapples for her."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems that when the clerk returned to the Chinaman's store  the appellant had already disappeared, taking the jewelry with her.</p>
<p>This testimony indicates, and we believe that it actually so happened,  that the boy who was carrying the jewels turned them over to the appellant for safe-keeping while he went  after the pineapples for her.   It  is not probable that he  would have left the  jewelry  in  the  Chinaman's store under  any  other  circumstances.  He was  not acquainted in the store and merely stopped there casually to shelter himself from the rain.   This being so, it can not be said that there  was any actual<em> taking (apoderamiento)</em> of the jewels.  The appellant did not, in fact, possess herself, or take the property in question, in the technical and legal sense in which the words "to take possession of" and "to take" are used in the Penal Code in connection with the crimes of robbery and theft, but simply "to receive" them from the clerk, who voluntarily delivered  them to her in trust, the clerk in turn having received the same from the owner, the complaining witness in this case. If there were no actual taking, there could have been no robbery because this  crime can not be committed except by <em>taking possession</em> of the personal property of another against the latter's will.   (Article 502 of the Penal Code.)</p>
<p>The  fact that  the jewels in question had been delivered to the defendant temporarily for safe-keeping certainly did not authorize her to keep them, but on the contrary she was obliged to return the same to the person from whom  she received them.  There can be no question as to this; neither can  there be any question that the misappropriation of these jewels by  the appellant  under such circumstances constituted  an  offense  against property.  But  legally speaking, this offense is not and can not be that of robbery with which the appellant in this case is charged.</p>
<p>We accordingly reverse the judgment of the trial  court and acquit the appellant of the charge of robbery with  the costs of both instances <em>de oficio.</em> After the expiration of ten days from the date of final judgment,  let the case be remanded to the Court of First Instance for  proper procedure.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Carson, Willard,</em> and <em>Tracey,</em> concur.<br>
