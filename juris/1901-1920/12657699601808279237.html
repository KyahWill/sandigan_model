				<H3>AGAPITO BONZON, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. STANDARD OIL COMPANY OF NEW YORK AND LEONARDO OSORIO, AS SHERIFF, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment sustaining a demurrer to the original 
complaint filed in this action. The complaint alleges, in substance, that 
plaintiff purchased certain real-estate at an execution sale, paying therefor 
the sum of P2,170 to the defendant sheriff, who turned over the purchase price 
to the defendant company, the execution creditor, at whose instance the sale was 
had that there-after, plaintiff having gone into possession of the land was 
evicted therefrom in judicial proceedings, wherein the court found that the land 
in question was the property of certain third parties, and that neither the 
judgment debtor nor the purchaser at the execution sale had any title thereto. 
The prayer of the complaint is for judgment against the judgment creditor and 
the sheriff for the amount of the purchase price paid at the execution sale.
<p>The principal contention of counsel for appellee is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The only question presented by plaintiff is the interpretation to be placed 
upon section 470 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Unless this section gives him 
the remedy for which he contends, he has stated no cause of action, because the 
only other theory upon which he could possibly require a reimbursement of the 
price paid by him at the sheriff's sale is that of an implied warranty by the 
judgment creditor and the sheriff. The complaint shows no compliance, as to the 
Standard Oil Company, with article 1481 of the Civil Code.</p>
<p>"We must admit that section 470 of the Code of Civil Procedure leaves 
something to be desired in the way of clearness. Its English text, which of 
course must govern in case of any discrepancy between the English and the 
Spanish versions, is as follows:</p>
<p>"'SEC 470. If the purchaser of real property sold on execution, or his 
successor in interest, be evicted therefrom in consequence of irregularities in 
the proceedings concerning the sale, or of the reversal or discharge of the 
judgment, he may recover the price paid, with interest, from the judgment 
creditor. If the purchaser of property at such official sale, or his successor 
in interest, fail to recover possession in consequence of irregularity in the 
proceedings concerning the sale, or because the property sold was not subject to 
execution and sale, the court having jurisdiction thereof shall, after notice 
and on motion of such party in interest, or his attorney, revive the original 
judgment in the name of the petitioner, for the amount paid by such purchaser at 
the sale, with iriterest thereon from the time of payment at the same rate that 
the original judgment bore; and the judgment so revived shall have the same 
force and effect as would an original judgment of the date of the revival and no 
more.'</p>
<p>"It appears, as appellant says, that this section divides naturally into two 
parts: (1) Authorizing the recovery of the purchase price under certain 
conditions, and (2) authorizing the revival of the judgment in behalf of the 
purchaser in other circumstances. Plaintiff claims to be entitled to the remedy 
set out in the first part of the section. It is apparent, however, that 
plaintiff's eviction, as set up in his complaint, is not due to any of the 
causes shown in this first part of section 470. So far as appears, 'the 
proceedings concerning the sale' were perfectly regular, and the complaint 
discloses no 'reversal or discharge of the judgment' upon whose execution 
plaintiff became a purchaser.</p>
<p>"The second part of section 470, applied by the judge of the trial court, 
seems, at first glance, not exactly applicable, because it provides for the case 
where the purchaser may 'fail to recover possession,' while in the present case 
the purchaser entered into possession and was subsequently dispossessed by 
others. We think, however, that the phrase 'fail to recover possession' was 
intended to meet such a case as this; otherwise section 470 would not meet a 
case like the present, although it was obviously intended to."</p></blockquote>
<p>We agree with counsel for the appellee that the section of the Code in 
question leaves something to be desired in the way of clearness; and it may be 
admitted that it is only by a liberal construction of the language used in the 
statute that the sale of property under execution in which the judgment debtor 
has no title, can be held to be an "irregularity in the proceedings concerning 
the sale."</p>
<p>But we are of opinion, that the section of the Code of Civil Procedure under 
consideration, being remedial in its character, should be construed liberally so 
as to give a remedy as broad as that to be obtained by the corresponding suit in 
equity, which we think, would extend to a case where the sale of property under 
execution is held to be void on the ground that the judgment debtor had no 
title.</p>
<p>The supreme court of California, discussing the provisions of section 708 of 
the California Code of Civil Procedure in the case of Merguire <em>vs.</em> 
O'Donnell (139 CaL, 6), held as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We think a sale made by a sheriff on an order of the court and a void 
execution is 'irregular' in the extreme degree, and that a sale had on a void 
execution is void for the reason of 'irregularity in the proceedings concerning 
the sale.' Section 708 of the Code of Civil Procedure, being remedial in its 
character, should be liberally construed. (Hitchcock <em>vs.</em> Caruthers, 100 
CaL, 100; Cross <em>vs.</em> Zane, 47 CaL, 602.) The section under consideration 
was intended to give a remedy by petition in the action which had culminated in 
the judgment sought to be revived. There was arid is a remedy by an independent 
suit in equity by which similar relief may be had as is given by the statute 
(Scherr <em>vs.</em> Himmelman, 53 Cal., 312); and this remedy as administered 
in equity extends to cases where the execution and sale under it are both held 
to be void (Smith <em>vs.</em> Reed, 62 Cal., 345); and, giving the section the 
liberal construction required, it is clear that the remedy intended to be given 
under it is as broad as that to be obtained in the corresponding action in 
equity. It is certainly necessary and consonant with the principles of equity 
that a party should have relief in cases where the execution and sale are void, 
as well as in those cases where there is an irregularity of such a character as 
to render the sale merely voidable. Indeed, it would seem that the requirements 
of equity were the same in both the supposed cases, and there is no good reason 
for applying the section to one of them and not to the other."</p></blockquote>
<p>Upon like principles we think that where a sheriff, by virtue of the 
authority conferred upon him by the issuance of an execution to sell the 
property of the judgment debtor, undertakes to sell and does sell property or an 
interest in property to which the judgment debtor is in no wise entitled, there 
is certainly a grave irregularity in the procedure had under color of the 
authority conferred by the execution, and it would Seem that in the absence of 
some sufficient reason to the contrary, such an irregularity may fairly be Ijeld 
to be an "irregularity in the proceedings concerning the sale."</p>
<p>No sound reason suggests itself for restricting the meaning of the language 
of the statute so as to exclude there from cases such as that under 
consideration. While the doctrine of <em>caveat emptor,</em> relied upon by 
counsel for appellee, has its legitimate force and effect in precluding any idea 
of a warranty by plaintiff or defendant in execution or by the sheriff, it has 
no application in a case where a purchaser acquires <em>no title</em> to the 
property sold, as distinguished from a case wherein there is only a partial 
failure of title; and it has been universally held that in case of failure of 
title a bona fide purchaser is entitled to recover the purchase price from the 
officer, if the funds are still in his hands, or from the judgment debtor. True 
it is that in some jurisdictions in the United States purchasers at execution 
sales where the debtor had no title to the property sold have no cause of action 
against the judgment creditors, but in others, "by judicial construction or 
express statutory enactment," a bona fide purchaser is given a cause of action 
against the execution creditors as well as the judgment debtor in case of 
failure of title. See text and cases cited under heading "Rights and remedies on 
failure of title." (17 Cyc, 1319.) And we think that such was the intention of 
the legislator in enacting the section under consideration.<br><br>In this 
jurisdiction (even in the absence of the statute), under the general principle 
that one person may not enrich himself at the expense of another, a judgment 
creditor would not be permitted to retain the purchase price of land sold as the 
property of the judgment debtor after it has been made to appear that the 
judgment debtor had no title to the land and that the purchaser had failed to 
secure title thereto, and we find no difficulty therefore in accepting a liberal 
construction of the statute which arrives at the same equitable result.</p>
<p>The judgment in favor of the Standard Oil Company, and the execution issued 
thereon, gave to that company merely the right to have the property of the 
judgment debtor sold in satisfaction of the judgment. It did not and could not 
give the company the right to have the judgment satisfied out of the property of 
any other person. By the tortious act of the sheriff, certain property was sold 
to which the judgment debtor had no title whatever; and the proceedings 
concerning the sale having been found to be void and the purchaser having been 
evicted from the property, it is clear that the company had no right under its 
judgment to the proceeds of the sale, and that the sale having been held to have 
been void, the purchaser at the sale is equitably entitled to the return of the 
purchase price. This is precisely the result which we hold the remedial 
provisions of the section under consideration were intended to secure, and it is 
the result which naturally and properly follows from a liberal construction of 
its terms.</p>
<p>We think that it will help to clear up the uncertainty as to the meaning of 
the different provisions of the statute if it be kept in min3 that the remedy 
provided in cases where "the property sold was not subject to execution and 
sale" was evidently intended to include cases wherein exempted property of the 
judgment debtor is sold under execution, and does not refer to cases wherein 
property of third persons is tortiously seized and sold, the case of Hitchcock 
<em>vs.</em> Caruthers (100 Cal., 100), cited in appellee's brief, to the 
contrary notwithstanding. We think that the reasoning on which that decision 
should have been based is that set forth in the later case of Merguire 
<em>vs.</em> O'Donnell, above cited.</p>
<p>The plaintiff's right to recovery from the judgment creditor not being 
predicated on the theory of an express or implied warranty of title, defendant's 
contentions based on the provisions of article 1481 of the code need not be 
considered at this time. If defendant was not given an opportunity to be heard 
in the.eviction proceedings, it would seem that he can avail himself in the 
pending action of any defense which if set up in the former action would have 
relieved him from liability to reimburse the purchaser.</p>
<p>Let judgment be entered reversing the order of the court below sustaining the 
demurrer to the complaint, and directing that the record be returned to the 
court below for further proceedings in accordance with law and the principles 
herein set forth.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Trent</em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em>Moreland, J.,</em> concurs in the result.</p>
<p>Judgment reversed; case remanded.<br></p></div>
