				<H3>GEORGE O. DIETRICH, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. O.K. FREEMAN, JAMES L. PIERCE, AND BURTON WHITCOMB, DEFENDANTS.â€”BURTON WHITCOMB, APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>TRENT, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This action was brought against O. K. Freeman, James L. Pierce, and Burton Whitcomb, as owners and operators of the Manila&nbsp; Steam&nbsp; Laundry, to recover the sum of P952 alleged to be the balance due the plaintiff for services performed during the period from January 9, 1907, to December 31,&nbsp; 1908.&nbsp;&nbsp; Judgment&nbsp; was&nbsp; rendered in favor&nbsp; of the plaintiff and against Freeman and Whitcomb, jointly and severally, for the sum of P752 with interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from the 27th day of August, 1909, and the&nbsp; costs of the&nbsp; cause.&nbsp; The&nbsp; complaint as to Pierce was dismissed, Whitcomb alone appealing.<br><br>When&nbsp; the plaintiff was&nbsp; first employed&nbsp; on&nbsp; the 9th of January, 1907, this steam laundry was owned and operated by Freeman and Pierce.&nbsp; Pierce, on the 18th of January, 1907, sold all of his right, title,&nbsp; and interest in the said laundry&nbsp; to&nbsp; Whitcomb, who,&nbsp; together&nbsp; with Freeman,&nbsp; then became the owners of this laundry and continued to operate the same as long as the plaintiff was employed.<br><br>The trial court found that the&nbsp; balance due the plaintiff for services performed amounted to the sum of P752.&nbsp;&nbsp; This finding is fully supported by the evidence&nbsp; of record.<br><br>Counsel for the appellant&nbsp; Whitcomb now insists - <br><ol type="1"><li>That the court erred in giving, jointly and severally, a&nbsp; judgment against Freeman and Whitcomb&nbsp; for&nbsp; any sum whatever; and<br><br></li><li>That the court erred in holding the&nbsp; appellant Whitcomb liable.</li></ol>It appears from the record that Whitcomb never knew the plaintiff, never had anything&nbsp; to do with him personally, and that the&nbsp; plaintiff's contract was with Freeman, the managing partner of the&nbsp; laundry.&nbsp; It further appears from the record that Pierce, after he sold his interest in this laundry to Whitcomb, continued to look after Whitcomb's interest by authority of the latter.<br><br>Articles 17 and 119 of the&nbsp; Code of Commerce provide:<br><blockquote>"Art.&nbsp; 17. The record in the commercial registry shall be optional&nbsp; for private merchants&nbsp; and compulsory for associations established in accordance with this code or with special laws, and for vessels.<br><br>"Art.&nbsp; 119. Every commercial association before beginning business shall&nbsp; be obliged to record its establishment, agreements, and conditions in&nbsp; a&nbsp; public instrument, which shall be&nbsp; presented for record in the commercial&nbsp; registry, in accordance with the provisions&nbsp; of article 17.<br><br>"Additional instruments which&nbsp; modify&nbsp; or&nbsp; alter in any manner whatsoever the original&nbsp; contracts of the association are subject to the same formalities, in&nbsp; accordance with the provisions of article 25.<br><br>"Partners can not make private&nbsp; agreements, but all&nbsp; must appear in the articles of co-partnership."</blockquote>In the&nbsp; organization of this partnership by Freeman and Whitcomb the above provisions of law were&nbsp; not complied with; that is, no formal partnership was ever entered into by them,&nbsp; notwithstanding the fact that they were engaged in the operation of this laundry.<br><br>The purposes for which this partnership was entered into by Freeman and&nbsp; Whitcomb show clearly that&nbsp; such partnership was not a commercial one; hence the&nbsp; provisions of the Civil&nbsp; Code and not the Code of Commerce must govern in&nbsp; determining the liability of the partners.&nbsp; (Manresa, vol. 1, p. 184; Aramburo, Civil Capacity, 407,&nbsp; 432; Prautch <i>vs</i>. Hernandez, 1&nbsp; Phil&nbsp; Rep., 705; and Co Pitco <i>vs</i>.&nbsp; Yulo, 8 Phil. Hep., 544.)<br><br>In support of the second&nbsp; assignment of error our attention has been called to the cases of Hung-Man-Yoc <i>vs</i>. Kieng- Chiong-Seng (6 Phil. Rep., 498); Ang Quian Cieg <i>vs</i>. Te Chico&nbsp; (12 Phil. Rep., 533) ; Bourns<i> vs.</i>&nbsp; Carman&nbsp; (7 Phil. Rep., 117).&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first of these cases the partnership was a mercantile one, as it&nbsp; was engaged in the importation of goods for sale at a profit.&nbsp; This was also true in the second case.&nbsp; In neither of these cases were the&nbsp; provisions of articles 17 and 119 of the Code of Commerce complied with.&nbsp;&nbsp; Those partnerships, although&nbsp; commercial, were not&nbsp; organized in accordance with the provisions of the&nbsp; Code of&nbsp; Commerce as expressed in those articles.&nbsp;&nbsp; In determining1 the liability of the partners in these cases the court, after making the finding of facts, was governed by the provisions of article 120 of the&nbsp; Commercial&nbsp; Code.&nbsp; In the&nbsp; last case cited the partnership was one of <i> cuentas en participacion</i>.&nbsp; "A partnership,"&nbsp; quoting from the&nbsp; syllabus in&nbsp; this case, " constituted in such a manner that its existence was only known to those who had&nbsp; an interest&nbsp; in the same, there being no mutual agreement between the partners, and without a corporate name indicating to&nbsp; the&nbsp; public&nbsp; in&nbsp; some way that there were other people besides the one&nbsp; who ostensibly managed and&nbsp; conducted the business, is exactly the accidental partnership of <i>cuentas&nbsp; en participacion</i> defined in article 239 of the Code of Commerce."<br><br>In a partnership of<i> cuentas en participacion,</i>&nbsp; under the provisions of article 242&nbsp; of the Code of Commerce, those who contract with the person in whose name the business of such&nbsp; a partnership was conducted shall have only&nbsp; the right of action against such person and not against other persons interested.&nbsp; So this case is easily distinguished from the case at bar, in that the one did not have the corporate name&nbsp; while&nbsp; the&nbsp; other was known&nbsp; as the Manila&nbsp; Steam Laundry.<br><br>The plaintiff was employed by and performed services&nbsp; for the Manila Steam Laundry and was not employed by nor did he perform services&nbsp; for Freeman alone.&nbsp; The&nbsp; public did not deal&nbsp; with Freeman and Whitcomb personally, but with the Manila Steam Laundry.&nbsp;&nbsp; These two partners were doing&nbsp; business under this name&nbsp; and, as we have said, it was not a commercial&nbsp; partnership.&nbsp; Therefore, by the&nbsp; express provisions of articles 1698 and 1137 of the Civil Code the partners are not liable&nbsp; individually for the entire amount due the plaintiff.&nbsp;&nbsp; The liability is pro rata and in this case the appellant is responsible to the plaintiff for&nbsp; only one-half of the debt.<br><br>For these&nbsp; reasons the&nbsp; judgment of the court below&nbsp; is reversed and judgment entered in favor of&nbsp; the plaintiff and against the defendant Whitcomb&nbsp; for the&nbsp; sum of P376, with interest as fixed&nbsp; by the court&nbsp; below.&nbsp; No&nbsp; costs will be allowed either party in this&nbsp; court.<br><br>A motion was filed on the 22d of August, 1910, by O'Brien and De Witt, asking this court to strike from the record certain allegations in the&nbsp; printed&nbsp; brief of counsel for the appellee.&nbsp; These allegations are as follows:&nbsp; "Does the receipt bear the earmarks of newly discovered evidence?&nbsp; Or of newly manufactured evidence?"&nbsp; These questions were directed against O'Brien,&nbsp; one of the counsel&nbsp; for appellant in this case,&nbsp; and were intended to have the&nbsp; court believe that O'Brien&nbsp; had manufactured&nbsp; the receipt&nbsp; referred&nbsp; to. There&nbsp; is nothing in this record which shows that O'Brien did falsify or manufacture that receipt.&nbsp; These&nbsp; questions are clearly impertinent. It is our duty to keep our records&nbsp;&nbsp; clean and&nbsp; free from such unwarranted statements.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is, therefore, ordered that the same be stricken from the record. So ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J., Mapa, Carson, </i>and <i>Moreland, JJ.</i>, concur.<br></div>
