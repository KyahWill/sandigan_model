  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The defendant on the 19th day of January, 1904, was the managing editor of "La Democracia" a daily newspaper published in Manila.   In the issue for that day there appeared an article addressed to the plaintiff.  The plaintiff, considering that the article was libelous, brought  this action to recover damages.  Judgment was entered in his favor for the  sum of $500, money of the  United States. The defendant moved for a new trial in the court below, which was denied, and the case has been brought here by bill of exceptions.</p>
<p>It is very clear that the article published was  libelous. In fact, the appellant  in his brief in this court refers to it as severe and' mortifying to the plaintiff.</p>
<p>The defendant in his answer set up a counterclaim for damages caused  by the publication by the plaintiff in "El Noticiero," a newspaper published in Manila, of which the plaintiff was director and proprietor, of an article on the 18th day of January, 1904, which the defendant claimed was a libel against him.   In his  brief in  this court the defendant also apparently claims that publication of this article by the plaintiff on the 18th day of January justified the defendant  in publishing the article in question in his paper on the 19th.  There was  no evidence in the case to show that the defendant was the person referred to in the article published by the plaintiff, and, even if he were, publication of  a  libel by the plaintiff is no legal justification for the publication of another libel by the defendant. (Oausin <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Ricamora,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> No. 2033, 4 Off. Gaz., 218.)</p>
<p>The answer  in the case was filed on the 21st of March, 1904.  The defendant, who had been appointed a member of the Honorary Commission which was sent to the Exposition at St. Louis, left the Islands on the 23d of April, 1904.</p>
<p>The case was  brought  on for trial in July of  that year, while  the defendant  was absent in the United States. Prior to the hearing the defendant's counsel moved for a continuance on the ground of the defendant's absence from the Islands.  This motion was denied.  After the plaintiff had terminated his evidence the defendant renewed  the motion.   Plaintiff's counsel stated that they had no  objection to a continuance if the court saw fit  to grant it.  The court, however, refused to grant a continuance, and entered judgment as above stated.  To the refusal of the court to grant the continuance the defendant excepted.   This exception can not be sustained.  The action of the court falls within the provisions  of section 141 of the  Code of Civil Procedure, and the ruling of the court upon the motion to postpone the trial was not subject to exception.</p>
<p>The damages assessed  by the court below in favor of the plaintiff were $500, money of the United States.  We fix the damages at $250.   (Loyzaga <em>vs</em>.  Cavanna,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> No. 1745 December 14, 1905.)</p>
<p>The judgment of the court below is modified by changing the recovery from $500, money  of the United  States, to P250.  As so modified  it is affirmed.  No  costs  will  be allowed to either party in this court.   After the expiration of twenty days judgment will  be entered in accordance herewith  and the case remanded to the lower  court  for execution.  So ordered.</p>
<em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Johnson,</em> and <em>Carson, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
