				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The findings of fact are clearly stated by the trial court as follows:
<blockquote>
<p>"This case happened at midnight of the cited date when Vivencio Tercero, on 
coming from a house where there was a certain dead person (<em>casa 
mortuoria</em>), in order to husk palay, was returning to the house of one 
Julian where he used to sleep because his own house was quite far. On the way, 
these two accused and one Braulio had been waiting for Vivencio Tercero, and 
when the latter arrived at the place where they were, they called him, and the 
accused Jacinto Robles asked him why he had been in the house where the dead 
was. Vivencio Tercero answered Robles that he was courting a young lady named 
Paciencia Lera. Jacinto then told him to stop courting the girl. Vivencio 
answered that he could not do so, and that if Jacinto and his companion liked to 
court the girl they could do so at any time. The accused Pantaleon Reyes replied 
that whether Vivencio Tercero desisted or not they would injure him on that 
night, and they began to assault him. Vivencio Tercero fell to the ground, and 
his aggressors left him there thinking he was dead.</p>
<p>"The wounds of the offended party lasted for thirty-five days before they 
were cured with medical assistance, he having spent for medicine the sum of P10. 
All the wounds are now healed; but the wound inflicted on the right hand which 
cut the arteries of the ring finger and the little finger makes said hand 
useless or at least the two lingers mentioned."</p></blockquote>
<p>Additional to the foregoing it is only necessary to mention that the 
testimony of one witness is sufficient to support a judgment of conviction if it 
satisfies beyond a reasonable doubt. In the present case the testimony of the 
complaining witness is positive, clear, and free from contradiction. (U. S. 
<em>vs</em>. Dacotan [1903], 1 Phil. Rep., 669; U. S. <em>vs</em>. Mondejar 
[1911], 19 Phil. Rep., 158.) The accused relied on an alibi. But, to establish 
such a defense, it must be proved by nothing less than full, clear, and 
satisfactory evidence. In the present case an alibi has not been proved by 
probable evidence which reasonably satisfies the court of the truth of such a 
defense. (U. S. <em>vs</em>. Pascua [1903], 1 Phil. Rep., 631; U. S. 
<em>vs</em>. Oxiles [1915], 29 Phil. Rep., 587.)</p>
<p>There being present in the commission of the crime the aggravating 
circumstance of nocturnity, the sentence of the trial court must be modified by 
imposing upon the defendant and appellant the maximum penalty, which is two 
years eleven months and eleven days of <em>prision correccional</em>, with 
one-half of the costs of the first instance and all the costs of this instance, 
and to indemnify, with his coaccused who did not appeal, singly and jointly, the 
offended party Vicente Tercero in the amount of P62.50, or to suffer subsidiary 
imprisonment in case of insolvency. So ordered.</p><em>Arellano, C. J., 
Johnson</em>, and <em>Araullo, JJ.</em>, concur. <br><br><br>

<p>STREET, J.: concurring:</p>
<p>I concur on the ground that the proof of alibi presented in this case is not 
such as reasonable to satisfy the court of its truthfulness; but I regret to see 
the unqualified proposition appear in the opinion of the court to the effect 
that an alibi "must be proved by full, clear, and satisfactory evidence." The 
use of this unqualified language tends to give currency to the idea that when 
proof of an alibi is offered in a criminal case the burden of proof for some 
mysterious reason shifts to the defendant. This is certainly not true. The 
burden of proof rests upon the Government to establish the guilt of the accused 
beyond a reasonable doubt; and this onus must be sustained throughout and in 
respect to every essential factor necessary to make out the crime. The 
expressions found in the book indicating that an alibi must be proved to the 
satisfaction of the court have their origin in the circumstance that when proof 
of an alibi is introduced it comes from the defendant at a time when there has 
already been placed before the court evidence connecting the defendant with the 
crime. In such situation the defendant must first meet and overcome what has 
already been offered before a reasonable doubt as to his guilt can arise in the 
mind of the judge. Consequently the proof which he may be required to adduce in 
order to generate a reasonable doubt of his guilt will depend upon the weight 
and character of the evidence already before the court showing or tending to 
show his connection with the crime. In regard to the proof of the alibi 
presented in U. S. <em>vs.</em> Pascua (1 Phil. Rep., 631), the court in that 
case said: "While the proof as to the alibi is well supported by the testimony 
of witnesses, yet such proof can have little weight <em>when the identity of the 
defendants as the persons who committed the offense has been fully established 
by eyewitnesses."</em> (Italic ours). In U. S. <em>vs</em>. Oxiles (29 Phil 
Rep., 587, 592), Justice Torres quotes the following syllabus from an American 
decision: "Where the Commonwealth rests upon positive and undoubted proof of the 
prisoner's guilt, it should not be overcome by less than full, clear and 
satisfactory evidence of the alleged alibi." When the words "full, clear, and 
satisfactory evidence" are thus put in opposition to the words "positive and 
undoubted proof," as here, there can be little objection to the mode of 
statement; but it is obvious that the words "full, clear, and satisfactory 
evidence" would never be penned by a judge whose mind was not in a measure 
preoccupied with the fact that the positive evidence connecting the accused with 
the crime and already before the court is sufficient to establish the 
defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, apart from the alibi. The language 
in question should therefore in our opinion not be stated in the form of an 
abstract rule.</p></div>
