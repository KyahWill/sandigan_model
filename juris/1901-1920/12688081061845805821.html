				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">It appears from the record that the appellant arrived at Manila, on the 21st 
day of August, 1917, on the steamship <em>Loongsang</em> and requested 
permission to enter the Philippine Islands upon the ground that he was a citizen 
thereof, having been born in said Islands. His right to enter was inquired into 
by a board of special inquiry. At the conclusion of said inquiry his request to 
enter was denied. An appeal was taken to the Collector of Customs and the 
decision of the board of special inquiry was by him confirmed. Thereupon a writ 
of habeas corpus was petitioned for in the Court of First Instance of Manila. At 
the conclusion of the hearing on said petition the writ was denied and the 
present appeal was perfected.
<p>The appellant now alleges that he has not been given a full, free, and fair 
hearing before the board of special inquiry, and that the order denying him the 
right to enter the Philippine Islands should be set aside and that he should be 
granted a new trial on the merits. The appellant now alleges that the record of 
the proceedings before the board. of special inquiry shows that said board had 
abused its authority in not giving him a full, free, and fair hearing; that it 
appears from the record that the said hearing was in great part made up of 
leading and misleading questions and untrue statements, calculated to confuse 
the witnesses and not adapted to discover the real merits of the petitioner's 
rights; that the board failed to present questions and refused to permit the 
attorney for the appellant to present questions which would bring to light the 
real, material, and important facts justifying his right to enter the Philippine 
Islands; that the Court of First Instance failed to find from the record that 
the board of special inquiry had abused its authority, power and discretion in 
refusing the appellant permission to land in the Philippine Islands, and that 
the decision of said board was arbitrary, frivolous and capricious and was not 
sustained by the evidence.</p>
<p>In reply to said alleged errors the Attorney-General, Quintin Paredes, admits 
that appellant has not been accorded a free, full, and fair hearing and 
recommended that he be given a new trial. The Attorney-General in his brief 
said:</p>
<p>"The issue raised by this appeal is whether the record shows abuse of 
discretion and authority on the part of the board of special inquiry which heard 
this case. Counsel for appellant directs attention to some very ill-advised 
action on the part of members of the board in their examination of the witnesses 
in this case. The misstatement of material facts to witnesses (rec, pp. 10 and 
12) and the barring of a witness before she had concluded her testimony (rec., 
p. 12) unquestionably are serious irregularities. And in the opinion of the 
undersigned, this petitioner was not accorded such a hearing as the law 
contemplates and assures immigrants. It is recommended that the record be 
remanded to. the immigration officials with instructions to grant this applicant 
a new hearing.</p>
<p>"Respectfully submitted."</p>
<p>While the hearings before the board of special inquiry are summary in that no 
special pleadings, etc., are required, they are, nevertheless, judicial in 
character, and the persons tried by such a board are entitled to a full, free, 
and fair hearing just as in any other cases where the rights of individuals are 
being inquired into. Such individuals have the right to be represented by an 
attorney, if they so desire. They have a right to present witnesses to support 
their request to enter. Their attorney has a right to present whatever pertinent 
questions he may desire to such witnesses, as will demonstrate or will tend to 
show the right of the immigrant to enter the country. (Edwards <em>vs</em>.

<p>The decisions of the customs administrative officers are final in cases like 
the present, unless there has been an abuse of the power and discretion vested 
in them. The courts, however, do not hesitate to review the decision of such 
administrative officers whenever it is alleged and shown that they have grossly 
abused the power and discretion conferred upon them, or where they acted in open 
violation of the law. (Ko Poco <em>vs</em>. McCoy, 10 Phil. Rep., 442; Chin Yow 
<em>vs</em>. U. S., 208 U. S. 8, 11; U. S. <em>vs</em>. Ju Toy, 198 U. S., 253; 
<em>Ex parte</em> Lung Foot, 174 Fed. Rep., 70; Lorenzo <em>vs</em>. McCoy, 15 
Phil. Rep., 559; Lim Yiong <em>vs</em>. Collector of Customs, 36 Phil. Rep., 
424.)</p>
<p>An alien seeking to enter territory of the United States, even though the 
hearing is summary, is entitled to a free, full, and fair hearing before he is 
denied the right to enter. The right to a hearing includes the right to have the 
evidence considered by the board. He is not only entitled to have the evidence 
which he presents considered, but he is entitled to present all of the evidence 
which he has and which is germane to the question of his right to enter. While 
the board of special inquiry is not technically a judicial body and the 
procedure is not technically judicial, nor are the proceedings defined by any 
particular rules or statutes, nevertheless, the board is required, under the 
procedure which it adopts, to give the immigrant or the alien an opportunity to 
show by proof that his request should be granted. (Edwards <em>vs</em>. McCoy, 
22 Phil. Rep., 598.)</p>
<p>It appears from the record that all of the witnesses presented by the 
appellant were people of humble origin and very ignorant. They were not 
accustomed, perhaps, to scenes of judicial proceedings. They were therefore, 
naturally, under the strain born of timidity and known ignorance. For that 
reason they were easily excited and intimidated. The board should have allayed 
their fears and put them, as far as possible, at their ease, at least to the 
point of indicating to them that they were under the protection, so long as they 
obey the law, of judicial authority. This the board did not do. Upon the 
contrary the board, with the evident intent to confuse and to unduly excite the 
witnesses, made statements to them which were positively untrue and unsupported 
by any part of the record. And not only that, but the board actually intimidated 
one important witness, apparently without reason, by informing her that she 
could give no further testimony in that case and that she was therefore forever 
barred from testifying before it. The entire examination by the board from the 
beginning to the end, of all of the witnesses, was made in a spirit of 
hostility. For that reason the board was rendered incapacitated to properly and 
judicially weigh and consider the evidence impartially. Where the record itself 
discloses the fact that the evidence is weighed in the spirit of hostility there 
cannot be that impartial, free, full and fair hearing contemplated by the law. 
(<em>Ex parte</em> Tom Toy Tin, 230 Fed. Rep., 747; Jouras <em>vs</em>. Allen, 
222 Fed. Rep., 756.)</p>
<p>It is the duty of the board to make an effort to arrive at the truth by 
hearing all of the witnesses and to permit them, without intimidation, to state 
all of the facts and to answer all of the pertinent questions put to them either 
by their attorney or by the board. (<em>Ex parte</em> Chin Loy You, 223 Fed. 
Rep., 833.)</p>
<p>The essential thing in investigations like the present as well as all other 
judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings is that there shall have been an honest 
effort to arrive at the truth by methods sufficiently fair and reasonable to 
amount to due process of law.</p>
<p>The burden of proving his right to enter the territory of the United States 
is upon the immigrant who seeks that privilege. To sustain that burden he has a 
right to call and present witnesses. To that end either he or his attorney 
should be permitted to ask such pertinent and material questions as will tend to 
support his contention. A denial of any of these rights is not authorized in law 
and amounts to an unfair and unjust hearing. If witnesses are presented by the 
board to dispute or to overcome the proof adduced by the immigrant then, of 
course, the latter, either by himself or by his attorney, has a perfect right to 
test the credibility of such witnesses by a proper cross-examination. (<em>Ex 
parte</em> Ung King Ieng, 213 Fed. Rep., 119.)</p>
<p>After a careful examination of the record we are persuaded that the 
recommendation of the Attorney-General should be adopted. It is, therefore, 
hereby ordered and decreed that the record be returned to the court whence it 
came with directions that the judgment appealed from be reversed and that an 
order be issued directing and commanding the board of special inquiry to give to 
the appellant a rehearing as speedily as the facts and circumstances will 
permit, and without any findings as to costs. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Carson, Araullo, Street</em>, and <em>Avanceña, 
JJ.</em>, concur.</p>

<p align="center"><em><strong>CONCURRING OPINION</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>MALCOLM, J.</strong>, <em>concurring</em>:</p>
<p>I agree with counsel for appellant and with the Attorney-General that 
petitioner was not accorded such a hearing by the board of special inquiry as 
the law contemplates and assures immigrants. Abuse of discretion is, therefore, 
disclosed. This is sufficient for the resolution of the case. As to the rights 
of attorneys before boards of special inquiry, especially the attorney's right 
of cross-examination, I withhold my opinion until the point is considered and 
decided by the court in an appeal now pending (Dee See Choon <em>vs</em>. 
Collector of Customs, 16 Off. Gaz., 931). No assignment of error on this point 
is made or discussed by appellant in the instant case.</p></div>
