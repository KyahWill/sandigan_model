				G.R. No. 7337, August 16, 1912</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND  APPELLEE, VS. LEONARDO BANDOC, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> The discovery of&nbsp; opium and of various utensils used in smoking opium, upon the premises of the defendant and appellant in&nbsp; this case, was conclusively established by the evidence of record.&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, the accused did&nbsp; not deny the truth of the testimony of the witnesses to the effect that they&nbsp; discovered opium&nbsp; upon his premises.&nbsp; He declared, however, that he knew nothing whatever about this opium and had no knowledge as to the fact that it was on his premises, or as to how&nbsp; it had gotten there; and counsel, relying upon the case of the&nbsp; U. S.<em> vs. </em>Tan Tayco and Co Sencho (12 Phil. Rep,, 739) insist that upon this showing the information should have been dismissed.<br><p> This contention&nbsp; of counsel can not be maintained.&nbsp; While it is true that in the case just cited we held that the discovery&nbsp; of opium&nbsp; in&nbsp; the house or upon&nbsp; the premises of an accused person is&nbsp; not conclusive&nbsp; evidence that such opium was in his possession and control, nevertheless it is under the law prima facie&nbsp; evidence to that effect, and is sufficient to sustain&nbsp; a conviction&nbsp; in&nbsp; the absence of a satisfactory explanation.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case at bar, we think that, under all the circumstances, as disclosed by the record, the trial court properly declined&nbsp; to&nbsp; accept the statements of the accused in regard to this matter; and we are of opinion that there can be no reasonable doubt that&nbsp; he&nbsp; had full knowledge&nbsp; of the fact that this opium was on his premises at the time it was, discovered.</p><p> We find&nbsp; no error&nbsp; in the&nbsp; proceedings&nbsp; prejudicial to the rights of the accused, and the judgment of the lower court convicting him of the offense with which he is&nbsp; charged, and imposing upon him the penalty prescribed by law, should be and is hereby affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant,</p><p><em>Arellano, C.J., Mapa, Johnson</em>, and <em>Trent, JJ.</em>, concur.<br></p></div>
