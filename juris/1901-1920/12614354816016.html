				G.R. No. 1922, March 31, 1906</h4>
				<H3>THE CITY OF MANILA, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. FRANCISCO GAMBE, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The testimony in this  case is conflicting and contradictory to a degree, but upon a careful examination of the whole record  we are of opinion that the  findings in the judgment of the trial court are sustained by the weight of the evidence.</p>
<p>Accepting the facts set out therein as correct, there can be no doubt  that the  defendant,  Francisco Gambe,  the pilot  who was in command and had complete control of the steamer Alfred at the time of the accident, and not the owners of the boat, must be held responsible for  the, damages  resulting thereirom.  It  was contended  that the owners should be held responsible because the Alfred was not equipped with  the most modern and improved means of communication from the bridge to the engine room, including a speaking tube.   But the lack of the speaking tube can  not be held as in any wise  contributing to the accident,  which was solely the result of  the  mistake on the part of the pilot in giving the  orders "forward" and "full speed forward" when he should have given the order "astern" or "full speed astern."</p>
<p>It is contended further that the record fails  to show the actual damage suffered by the bridge, and therefore furnishes no basis for a judgment in damages, but we think that the  testimony  of Major  Case, the city  engineer of Manila, and A. W.  Ayres, inspector of the port, is  conclusive upon this point, and no evidence in rebuttal having been introduced by the defense, we must sustain the finding of the trial court as to the actual damages inflicted upon the  bridge.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed  from should be, and is hereby, affirmed, with costs against the appellant.   After expiration of twenty days let judgment be entered in accordance herewith and ten days thereafter the record remanded to the court  below for proper action.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C J,, Torres, Mapa, </em>and <em>Johnson, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><strong>WILLARD, J.:</strong></p>
<p>I do not concur as to the amount of  damages.<br>
