				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE, VS. ISABELO DINSING ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.

				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>We find from evidence that the defendants Isabelo Dinsing and Vicente Chaves killed Juan Oyoa in the manner described in the complaint.  In our opinion they are both principals in the  crime.   Where several  men  take part directly  in the execution of the act they are all  principals under article 13 of the Penal Code, although they may have acted under the direction of one of their number as leader. <br>
  <br>
  he amended complaint  complying with article 6, 2 of General  Orders, No. 58, designates the offense as homicide and complying with 3 of the same article states facts which show it to be murder.</p>
<p> Under such a complaint we have held  that the  defendant can not be convicted of the latter offense.</p>
<p> That the act was committed at night  is to be taken into consideration as an aggravating circumstance and the penalty must be  imposed in its maximum degree.   The  judgment of  the court faelow is modified and we find the defendants Isabelo Dinsing and Vicente Chaves  guilty as principals of  the crime of homicidio with an aggravating circumstance and sentence  them to punishment  of twenty years of <em>reclusion temporal</em> with accessories and indemnity of 1,000 pesos to the heirs of  the deceased  and to pay the costs of this appeal and two-thirds of the costs of the first instance.  So  ordered.</p>
<p> <em>Arellano C. J.,  Torres, Cooper, Mapa,</em> and <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
