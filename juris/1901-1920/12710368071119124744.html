I answered no, that I did not know them, and then asked him 'What reason have you that you are asking for these men?' and he answered, 'I would like to know that because I was intending to go to a house where there is some money. His name is Ignacio,&nbsp; a merchant.'&nbsp;&nbsp; The conversation continued, and the accused said, 'I need those two men because they know Ignacio, and even if I do not know Ignacio I can do the business myself/&nbsp; I said&nbsp; to him, 'Why, are you not afraid?'&nbsp; And the accused said, 'I am not afraid because only Ignacio and his mother and a little girl&nbsp; live&nbsp; in that house,' and he then&nbsp; said to me that Ignacio, the merchant, had some money and&nbsp; he said to me that&nbsp; he saw when Ignacio was counting the money.&nbsp;&nbsp; He said,&nbsp; 'I was&nbsp; hunting&nbsp; those men,&nbsp; Angel and&nbsp; Apolinar, because I would like, to&nbsp; catch Ignacio because he has some money and is trying to&nbsp; go&nbsp; to Iloilo,'&nbsp; I told him that I thought&nbsp; it&nbsp; was not a good&nbsp; thing and as the house is within the&nbsp; municipality I&nbsp; thought the business was risky and he said to me, 'Although that&nbsp; house is within the town&nbsp; there&nbsp; are&nbsp; no houses near&nbsp; and&nbsp; it&nbsp; is separated from the other houses,' and then he bid me&nbsp; good-by and went to Silay."<br></blockquote>The next witness was Mr. Barber,&nbsp; a captain in the Constabulary, who identified&nbsp; the trunk&nbsp; and the basket, and their contents, which were taken from the defendant&nbsp; at Iloilo.<br><br>Guillermo Julayco testified that he knew the defendant; that the&nbsp; last time he saw&nbsp; him was about 9&nbsp; o'clock on the morning of May 4, 1910, coming out of the house of Ignacio Ferrero,&nbsp; walking toward the street,&nbsp; with&nbsp; his hand under his coat pocket as if he were carrying&nbsp; something heavy in&nbsp; it.<br><br>Severina Apao testified that the defendant and his <i>querida</i> were living in her house; that early on the morning of the day when Petra Magallon was murdered the&nbsp; defendant left her house, saying that he was going to the house of one Cesar to get some money;&nbsp; that he came back about&nbsp; noon, bringing some money wrapped in a handkerchief which he turned over to his <i>querida </i>Lucia; that on that&nbsp; same afternoon the defendant and his querida left for Iloilo on a <i>lorcha.</i><br><br>Filomena de la Roma (<i>alias </i>Lucia), the defendant's <i>querida,</i> was called as a witness for the prosecution and testified that she had lived with the defendant before&nbsp; he&nbsp; was married, but that after he got married they separated and she went to Iloilo; that&nbsp; they again began living together in April; that the defendant left the house where they were living&nbsp; about 5 o'clock on the morning of the day Petra Magallon was murdered&nbsp; and returned about 11 o'clock of the same day; that on his return he brought a little less than P100 in cash&nbsp; and turned it over to her and told her to keep it in the trunk;&nbsp; that she&nbsp; put&nbsp; this money in the trunk without counting it; that on the same afternoon about 2 o'clock, they left for Iloilo on a <i>lorcha</i>, taking the money with them; that while in Iloilo they&nbsp; bought the trunk which had been exhibited in court, and&nbsp; also the following articles.<br><blockquote>"A new pair of men's patent leather American make Regal shoes; one pair of ladies' shoes, new; a new Roskopf watch and chain; a set of&nbsp; two cuff buttons and two shirt buttons, new; two collars, new; two&nbsp; men's shirts, new; one&nbsp; pair of ladies' stockings, new?

On the 28th of April he was seeking two men to assist him in securing Ferrero's money.&nbsp; He returned on May 4th&nbsp; to the house where he and&nbsp; his concubine were&nbsp; stopping with a certain&nbsp; amount of money which he turned over&nbsp; to his <i> querida.</i>&nbsp; He, in company with his <i>querida,</i> left that afternoon for Iloilo, and while in Iloilo purchased various articles of value,&nbsp; which he&nbsp; had not&nbsp; been accustomed&nbsp; to&nbsp; using. He also lost some money at gambling.&nbsp; When arrested&nbsp; in that city, aside from these various articles, there was found in his possession the hat of Ignacio Ferrero.&nbsp; Ferrero identified this hat as his and&nbsp; showed&nbsp; that it was in the trunk along with the money.&nbsp; According to the defense the defendant had not used this hat, but the&nbsp; court below, on examining the same, found that&nbsp; it had&nbsp; been&nbsp; used.&nbsp; The&nbsp; defendant stated in the preliminary investigation that Filomena was his wife and that the money spent by them in Iloilo belonged to her and that he did not leave the house where they were stopping at any time&nbsp; on the morning of the 4th of May. In the Court of&nbsp; First Instance&nbsp; he told an entirely different story.&nbsp; No one saw the defendant enter the house, murder the old woman,&nbsp; nor take the money.&nbsp;&nbsp; All of the testimony is circumstantial, but it is strong and convincing.&nbsp;&nbsp; It allows the mind to rest easily upon the certainty of his guilt.&nbsp;&nbsp; All the facts are consistent with each other&nbsp; and with the main fact established&nbsp; (guilt of the defendant), and the circumstances taken together are&nbsp; of a conclusive&nbsp; nature.&nbsp;&nbsp; All produce a reasonable and moral certainty that the defendant, and no other person, committed this crime.<br><blockquote>"No general rule can be laid down as to the quantity of circumstantial evidence which in any case will suffice.&nbsp;&nbsp; All the circumstances proved must be consistent with each other, consistent with&nbsp; the hypothesis that the accused is guilty, and at the same time inconsistent with the hypothesis&nbsp; that he is innocent,&nbsp; and with every&nbsp; other rational hypothesis except that of guilt.&nbsp; (12 Cyc, 488.)<br><br>"A conviction may&nbsp; rest upon circumstantial&nbsp; testimony alone, but the facts and circumstances must be such as are absolutely incompatible upon any reasonable hypothesis with the innocence of the accused, and incapable of explanation upon any reasonable hypothesis other than that of the guilt of the accused."&nbsp;&nbsp; (State <i>vs.</i> Hunter, 50 Kan., 302.)<br></blockquote>Article 503 of&nbsp; the Penal Code provides&nbsp; as follows:<br><blockquote>"A person guilty of robbery with violence&nbsp; or intimidation of the person shall be punished:<br><br>"1. With the penalty of&nbsp; <i>cadena perpetua</i> to death, if on account or on the&nbsp; occasion&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; robbery there results homicide."<br></blockquote>The&nbsp; trial court found the defendant guilty of a violation of this article,&nbsp; without any aggravating or&nbsp; extenuating circumstances.&nbsp;&nbsp; This crime was committed in the dwelling house of the&nbsp; deceased and&nbsp; without any provocation,&nbsp; and also without&nbsp; respect for the age and sex of the deceased&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These facts&nbsp; must be&nbsp; considered as&nbsp; aggravating circumstances, as provided for in No. 20 of article 10 of the Penal Code.&nbsp;&nbsp; (U. S.&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Saadlucap, 3&nbsp; Phil. Rep., 437.)&nbsp;&nbsp; No extenuating circumstances were present.<br><br>The judgment of the court below is hereby reversed and it is adjudged&nbsp; and decreed that the&nbsp; defendant is&nbsp; guilty of the crime of robbery with homicide, with the aggravating circumstances above set forth, and we hereby sentence him to the extreme&nbsp; penalty of death, to the accessories provided by law,&nbsp; and to pay the costs.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i> Arellano, C.
