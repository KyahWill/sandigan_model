				<H3>SALUSTIANO LERMA  Y  MARTINEZ, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. FELISA MAMARIL, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.

				<BR><STRONG>TRACEY, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The plaintiff brought this action to annul his marriage ceremony with the defendant, on the ground that he  contracted it when  under  age and without the consent of his mother, then living.  He was at that time, in the month of October, 1900, 16 years old.  Shortly after the ceremony he was prosecuted at the instance of his mother for illegal marriage,  and being found guilty served a term of three months and ten days of <em>arresto mayor.</em></p>
<p>The question on  the merits  as to the validity  of the marriage is controlled by a decision of this court  in the case of Aguilar vs. Lazaro (4 Phil. Rep.,  735), in which it was held that the marriage of a man over 14 years of age to a woman over 12 was valid  by the  terms of General Orders, No. 68, and could not be declared a nullity because the consent of the parents was not obtained.  The point is not affected  by Act No. 1451,  passed  shortly  before the commencement of this action, which merely changes the age of consent.</p>
<p>The court below, denying the plaintiff relief,  awarded the  defendant the  sum  of  P50 per  month  from the commencement of the  action for her support.   Under the circumstances of the separation  proved in this case,  and  in view of the property inherited  by the husband,.we think this  award was proper, within the provisions of title 6  of the Civil Code, and more particularly of articles 142, 143, 144, and 148.</p>
<p>The judgment  of  the court below is affirmed with the costs of this instance.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J.,  Torres,,  Johnson,</em> and <em>Willard, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
