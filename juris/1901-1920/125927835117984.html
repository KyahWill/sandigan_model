				G.R. No. 895, September 13, 1902</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES,  COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE,  VS. BRAULIO ROQUE, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>LADD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> The defendant was convicted in the court below of falsification under article 304 in connection with No. 1 of article 300 of the Penal Code.   The evidence at the trial tended to show that he had been furnished by his employer, Captain Harford, with money to pay  certain shop bills contracted by the  latter, and   among others one  of H. Price &amp; Co. for 64 pesos; that he signed the name of M. Legaspi, an  employee of that firm, to what purported to be a receipt for the bill, which he then delivered to Captain Harford; and that he retained the money for about two weeks thereafter, when, having learned  that his deception had been discovered, he sought out H. Price &amp; Co. and paid the bill to them.  But as there was no evidence that  he imitated or attempted to imitate Legaspi's handwriting in the signature to the  receipt the conviction can not  be sustained.  In  order to constitute the  crime of <em>falsification</em> by "counterfeiting or feigning any writing, signature, or rubric" (Penal Code, art. 300, No. 1) there must be, as the language in which the crime is described  imports, a similitude between the genuine and the pretended writing, signature,  or  rubric.   This is the settled  doctrine of the supreme court of Spain, and it has been  adopted by this court.  (The United  States vs.  Emiliano  Paraiso, decided November 13, 1901, citing decisions of the supreme court of Spain.)  The  complaint should have been for <em>estafa</em>.</p>
<p> The judgment will be reversed and the defendant acquitted, with  costs de oficio.  So ordered.</p>
<p> <em>Arellano,  C. J., Torres, Gooper, </em>and  <em>Willard,  JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p> <em>Mapa, J., </em>did not sit in this case.</p>
