				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE, VS. LEANDRO DIAZ ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The provincial  fiscal in  his complaint, dated the 29th of November,  1902,  charges the  defendants with  being brigands, because Diaz knowingly accepted the office of vice-president,  Pioson the office of captain, and Leongsong that  of  lieutenant,  under appointments  made by  the brigands, whom they were doubtless assisting, without the, knowledge of the authorities and against the provisions of Act No. 518.</p>
<p>The defendants plead,not guilty.  As evidence against Diaz the prosecution introduced a statement made by him before Mr. Ira Keithley, inspector of Constabulary, and other witnesses.   This statement  is  written  in Tagalog and appears on page  5 of the record.  It is dated the 27th of November, 1902, and signed by Leandro Diaz.  Translated it is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Leandro Diaz, domiciled in the town of Tambolong, states that he is the vice-president of the new K. K. K. and accepted the said office a little less than one month ago on account of his fear of the ladrones, adding that the person who acts as president is one Gregorio Suarez,  and that since they received  the official appointment they have not held any meetings."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both Major Keithley and Inspector McIlvaine, and the policemen Vicente Domingo and Francisco Martinez, testified that they heard the statements made  by Leandro Diaz, which do  not show that the accused was a member of any band of brigands, or what was the true purpose of the K.K. K. association of which he  was vice-president.  It may be said, judging from the result of other cases referred to by the prosecuting attorney, that this society had for its purpose the preparation of a new  revolution against the Government of the United  States in these Islands.</p>
<p>Act No. 518 was passed on November 12, 1902.  As this act is not retroactive it can not be applied to those engaged in brigandage prior to that date, and if, as Diaz confessed on November  27, 1902,  he accepted the office of  vice-president a little  less than a month before, and regarding this statement,  the  only evidence against him, as true, it follows that his appointment was prior in date to the law referred to, and the  crime committed was therefore subject at that time to the provisions of the Penal Code. The record contains  no evidence  to show that Leandro Diaz was a member of a band of brigands engaged or about to engage in  acts prohibited  and  punished by said Act No. 518.   He can not, therefore, be found guilty of the crime of brigandage, and, in our judgment, must be acquitted, as were the  other defendants, Pioson and Leongsong.</p>
<p>Therefore, for the reasons stated, we are of the opinion that the judgment of the court below with respect to the appellant Leandro Diaz should be reversed and the latter acquitted, with the costs of both instances <em>de oficio</em>.  Upon the filing of an  information for the crime of insurrection, sedition, and conspiracy, defined and punished by  Act No. 292, the judge will take action against the three defendants in accordance with the law.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C.J., Cooper, Willard, Mapa,</em> and <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
