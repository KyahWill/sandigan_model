				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD,  J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This was a motion to  dismiss a  bill of exceptions in a Case tried  in the Court of  Land Registration.   The judge of that court refused to  sign the bill on the ground that the time for the presentation thereof had expired.  The appellant  applied  to  this  court  under the  provisions of section 499 of the Code  of Civil Procedure for an  order requiring the judge to sign and certify the bill.   Such an order was issued, based upon the decision of Fischer vs. Ambler  (1  Phil. Rep., 508).  (Albino  Santos vs. Simplicio del Rosario, judge of the Court of Land Registration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  4 Off. Gaz., 522.)  Pursuant to such order the bill of exceptions was signed and sent here,  and the appellee has now moved to dismiss it.</p>
<p>The  judgment was entered on November 9, 1904; the appellant excepted thereto on November  17; on December 6 he presented  a motion for a new trial; this was denied on December 7; on December 13 he presented to the judge for signature the  bill  of exceptions.  Upon these  facts the bill should  be dismissed.</p>
<p>If the exception taken by the appellant on November 17 can be considered as the notice of an intention to present a bill of exceptions required by section 143 of the Code of Civil Procedure, it was then the duty of the appellant to present the  bill of exceptions within ten days thereafter, which  time  expired on November 27.  The bill was not then presented. No application  was made to the court to extend the time  for such presentation,  and no  agreement was made with the adverse party to that effect, and when it was presented, on the 13th of December, the time for the presentation thereof had expired.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, the exception taken on November 17 can not  be  considered as the notice of  an  intention to present a bill of exceptions,  then the appellant did nothing from the 9th day of November to  the 6th day of December which could in any event be considered as such notice.   Said section 143 requires the notice to be given as soon as practicable, and it is apparent from the record in this case that it was practicable to  give this  notice before  twenty-seven days had elapsed.</p>
<p>The motion to dismiss the bill of exceptions is granted, with costs against  the appellant.   So ordered.</p>
