				<H3>JOSE LINO LUNA, PETITIONER AND APPELLANT, VS. EULOGIO RODRIGUEZ, RESPONDENT AND APPELLANT; SERVANDO DE LOS ANGELES, RESPONDENT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">It appears from the record that an election for the office of governor of the 
Province of Rizal was held on the 6th day of June, 1916. At said election Jose 
Lino Luna, Eulogio Rodriguez and Servando de los Angeles were candidates for 
said office. The election was closed, the votes cast in the various 
municipalities were counted, and a return was made by the inspectors of said 
municipalities to the provincial board of canvassers, who, after a canvass of 
said returns, proclaimed the following result:
<p>(<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) That Eulogio Rodriguez received 4,321 votes; (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) Jose Lino Luna 4,157; 
(<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>) Servando de los Angeles 3,576 votes; and (<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>) that Eulogio Rodriguez, having 
received a plurality of said votes, was duly elected governor of said 
province.</p>
<p>Against said proclamation Jose Lino Luna presented a protest in the Court of 
First Instance. Upon said protest issue was joined, hearing was had and a 
decision was rendered which was, on appeal, set aside and a new trial ordered. 
(Lino Luna <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Rodriguez and De los Angeles, 37 Phil. Rep., 186.) Complying with 
said order, a new trial was had at which the Honorable William E. McMahon, 
judge, presided. Additional evidence was adduced. After a consideration of all 
of the facts and the evidence adduced at both trials, Judge McMahon reached the 
conclusion that the ballots cast for the various candidates were as indicated in 
the returns of the inspectors of the various municipalities except those in the 
municipality of Taytay and Binangonan. In the municipality of Taytay, Judge 
McMahon found from the evidence that 50 ballots cast for Eulogio Rodriguez 
should not have been counted for him, and ordered that number of votes deducted 
from his total. In the municipality of Binangonan, Judge McMahon found that the 
inspectors did not close the polls at 6 o'clock p. m., and that a large number 
of persons voted after that time, and directed that the total vote of Eulogio 
Rodriguez should be reduced by the number of such votes, without ascertaining 
how many had been cast ,for Rodriguez and how many for Luna. By deducting the 
said votes in the municipality of Taytay and those cast after six o'clock p. m. 
in the municipality of Binangonan, Judge McMahon concluded that Jose Lino Luna 
had received a plurality of the legal votes cast at said election and ordered 
the provincial board of canvassers to correct its canvass accordingly. From that 
conclusion both parties to the contest appealed to this court and made several 
assignments of error. <br></p><p>Considering all of said assignments of error, we find that 
they present, in fact, but three questions:</p>
<blockquote><p>(1) What is the effect of holding the polls open after the hour fixed for 
closing the election?</p>
<p>(2) What is the effect of assistance rendered by the inspectors of the 
election to incapacitated persons, without first requiring of such persons an 
oath to the effect that they are incapacitated to prepare their own ballots?</p>
<p>(3) What is the effect of a failure on the part of the authorities to provide 
proper voting booths?</p></blockquote>
<p>With reference to the first question, the law provides that "at all the 
elections held under the provisions of this Act the polls shall be open from 
seven o'clock in the morning until six o'clock in the afternoon, during which 
period not more than one member of the board of inspectors shall be absent at 
one time, and then for not to exceed twenty minutes at one time." (Sec. 21 of 
Act No. 1582; sec. 11 of Act No. 2045; sec. 543 of Act No. 2657, and sec. 445 of 
Act No. 2711.) Are the provisions with reference to the time of opening and 
closing the polls mandatory? It is admitted in the present case that the polls 
were not closed at 6 p. m. The record shows that at 6 p. m. a large number of 
voters had not yet been able to vote and that, for that reason, an agreement was 
made between some of the candidates for office who were present and the board of 
inspectors, to the effect that the polls should be kept open in order that such 
electors might vote. No objection whatever to that agreement was made by any 
person at that time.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why all of the voters of the municipality had not voted 
before 6 p. m. was that the board of inspectors failed to have the list of 
voters properly prepared at 7 a. m., and therefore but few of the voters were 
able to vote before eleven or eleven-thirty in the morning. That failure, on the 
part of the board of inspectors, made it impossible for many of the voters of 
the municipality of Binangonan to vote before the regular time for the closing 
of the polls.</p>
<p>Shall the ballot of an innocent voter, who is prevented, through no fault of 
his, from casting the same before 6 p. m. be annulled for the simple reason that 
the polls were kept open, after the hour designated by the law, for the purpose 
of giving such voter an opportunity to vote?</p>
<p>Experience and observation has taught legislatures and courts that, at the 
time of a hotly contested election, the partisan spirit of ingenious and 
unscrupulous politicians will lead them beyond the limits of honesty and decency 
and by the use of bribery, fraud and intimidation, despoil the purity of the 
ballot and defeat the will of the people at the polls. Such experience has led 
the legislatures to adopt very stringent rules for the purpose of protecting the 
voter in the manner of preparing and casting his ballot to guard the purity of 
elections. (Paulino <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Cailles, 37 Phil. Rep., 825.)</p>
<p>The infinite ingenuity of violent partisan spirit in evading the rules and 
regulation of elections and the use of bribery, fraud and intimidation has made 
necessary the establishment of elaborate and rigid rules and regulations for the 
conduct of elections. The very elaborateness of these rules has resulted in 
their frequent violation and the reports of the courts are replete with cases in 
which the result of an election has been attacked on the ground that some 
provision of the law has not been complied with. Presumably, all the provisions 
of the election laws have a purpose and should therefore be observed. (Detroit 
<span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Rush, 82 Mich., 532; 10 L. R. A., 171; 9 R. C. L., 1091; Patton <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Watkins, 
131 Ala., 387; 90 Am. State Rep., 43, 72.)</p>
<p>It has been announced in many decisions that the rules and regulations, for 
the conduct of elections, <span style="font-style: italic;">are mandatory before the election, but when it is 
sought to enforce them after the election they are held to be directory only</span>, if 
that is possible, especially where, if they are held to be mandatory, <span style="font-style: italic;">innocent 
voters</span> will be deprived of their votes without any fault on their part. (Patton 
<span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Watkins, 131 Ala., 387; 90 Am. State Rep., 43, 72; Jones <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. State, 153 
Ind., 440.)</p>
<p>In the case of Gardiner <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Romulo (26 Phil. Rep., 521), we held that when 
the Election Law does <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> provide that a departure from a prescribed form will 
be fatal and such departure has been due to an honest mistake or 
misrepresentation of the Election Law, and such departure has <span style="font-style: italic;">not </span>been used as a 
means for fraudulent practices and it is clear that there has been a free and 
honest expression of the popular will, the law will be held to be directory and 
such departure will be considered a harmless irregularity. However, the 
irregularities may be so numerous as not to be attributed to ignorance or honest 
mistake, but to a design to defeat the will of the voters or to such careless 
disregard of the law as to amount not only to laches but to fraudulent intent. 
In such cases, the election officers should be punished, the election should be 
declared null and a new election held.</p>
<p>It has been held, therefore, very generally, that the provisions of a statute 
as to the manner of conducting the details of an election are not mandatory, but 
directory merely, and irregularities, in conducting an election and counting the 
votes, not proceeding from any wrongful intent and which deprives no legal voter 
of his vote, will not vitiate an election or justify the rejection of the entire 
votes of a precinct. (Behrensmeyer <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Kreitz, 135 111., 591; Hankey <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Bowman, 
82 Minn., 328; Sprague <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Norway, 31 Cal., 173; Webre <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Wilton, 29 La. Ann., 
610.)</p>
<p>The purpose of an election is to give the voters a direct participation in 
the affairs of their government, either in determining who shall be their public 
officials or in deciding some question of public interest; and for that purpose 
all of the legal voters should be permitted, unhampered and unmolested, to cast 
their ballot. <span style="font-style: italic;">When that is done and no frauds have been committed, the ballots 
should be counted and the election should not be declared null. Innocent voters 
should not be deprived of their participation in the affairs of their government 
for mere irregularities on the part of the election officers, for which they are 
in no way responsible</span>. A different rule would make the <span style="font-style: italic;">manner </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">method </span>of 
performing a public duty of greater importance than the <span style="font-style: italic;">duty </span>itself. (Loomis <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. 
Jackson, 6 W. Va., 613.)</p>
<p>The errors and irregularities which warrant the rejection of ballots and the 
annullment of an election and thus deprive lawful voters of their legal right to 
vote, should be such as to fully justify that result. (The People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Cook, 8 N. 
Y., 67; 59 Am. Dec, 451.) It has been held that even great irregularities on the 
part of election officers will not of necessity vitiate an election, where no 
fraud is committed or attempted, or no illegal vote was polled and no legal 
voter was deprived of his vote. (Morris <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Vanlaningham, 11 Kan., 269.)</p>
<p>No complaint is made that any fraud was committed nor that any person voted 
who had no right to vote, by reason of the fact that the polls were kept open 
after the hour fixed by the law. It is admitted that the polls were kept open 
after the hour, by the consent of all parties concerned, for the reasons and 
purposes above indicated. In view of such facts, should the vote of the innocent 
voter be annulled and he thereby deprived of his participation in the affairs of 
the government when he was guilty of no illegal act? If the inspectors may, for 
one reason or another, prevent the opening of the polls or delay the 
commencement of the voting until 11 o'clock in the morning and then close the 
polls in the evening so as to prevent all those who desire to vote from voting, 
without incurring criminal liability for a violation of the election laws, the 
same motives will induce them to delay the opening of the polls until later and 
thus prevent any to vote except those whom they desire.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">The polls should be opened and closed in strict accord with the provisions of 
the law. Voters who do not appear and offer to vote within the hours designated 
by the law should not be permitted to vote after the time for closing the polls 
has arrived</span>. Upon the other hand, if the voter is prevented, during the voting 
hours, from voting, and is not permitted to vote by reason of the failure of the 
inspectors to do their duty, then, certainly, in the absence of some fraud, 
neither sueh votes nor the entire vote of the precinct should be annulled simply 
because some votes were cast after the regular hour. (People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Prewett, 124 
Cal., 7; Packwood <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Brownell, 121 Cal., 478; Pickett <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Russell, 42 Fla., 
116.)</p>
<p>The decisions in the various States of the United States are not uniform upon 
the effect of a failure to open and close polls at the time specified by the 
law. In some States such a provision has been held to be mandatory, in others 
directory. <span style="font-style: italic;">The decisions seem to be based upon the language of the particular 
statutes discussed</span>.</p>
<p>We are not inclined to the belief that the legislature intended that a 
failure to comply with the law in this jurisdiction should render the entire 
election void, nor nullify the votes cast after the period mentioned in the law, 
unless the polls were kept open after the hour for the purpose of permitting 
some <span style="font-style: italic;">fraud </span>to be committed, or for the purpose of permitting some person to vote 
who had not appeared during the regular voting hours.</p>
<p>The section of the law which we are discussing provides that "not more than 
one member of the board of inspectors shall be absent at one time and then for 
not to exceed twenty minutes at one time." Suppose that the evidence showed that 
two of the inspectors were absent at one time and for a period longer than 
twenty minutes, would the courts be justified in holding that the ..entire 
election was void, in the absence of fraud, for that reason? There is little 
justification for holding that one provision of said section is mandatory and 
the other directory.</p>
<p>Our conclusion upon the first question, in view of the foregoing, is that in 
the present case there seems to be no justification, under the facts, there 
being no fraud committed, for annulling the votes of innocent voters who were 
permitted by the election inspectors to cast their votes in a legal manner after 
the regular hour for closing the polls. <span style="font-style: italic;">In this conclusion, however, we do not 
desire to be understood to have decided that in no case should the courts not 
annul and set aside an election, where fraud is clearly proved, for a violation 
of the section under discussion</span>. When the polls are kept open after the hour 
prescribed by the law for the purpose of defeating the will of the people, such 
a violation of the law should result in annulling and setting aside the election 
of that precinct. No such facts exist in the present case. It is true, perhaps, 
that a number of the votes cast after the hour for closing the polls were 
sufficient to change the result of the election, but the result would have been 
the same had those same voters been permitted to vote, except for the negligence 
of the inspectors, during the regular hours for voting. There seems to be no 
more reason for annulling the votes cast, after the hour for closing the 
election, than for annulling the election for the reason that the inspectors 
failed to provide the means for voting at the time fixed for opening the polls 
in the morning.</p>
<p>We are firmly of the opinion that instead of depriving the innocent voters of 
their right to participate in the affairs of their government for irregularities 
committed by the election inspectors, the latter should be proceeded against in 
a criminal action for failure, on their part, to comply with the law and be 
punished in accordance with section 29 of Act No. 1592; section 2632 of Act No. 
2657 and section 2639 of Act No. 2711.</p>
<p>The various and numerous provisions of the Election Law are adopted <span style="font-style: italic;">to assist</span> 
the voters in their participation in the affairs of the government, and <span style="font-style: italic;">not to 
defeat</span> that object. When the voters have honestly cast their ballots, the same 
should not be nullified simply because the <span style="font-style: italic;">officers </span>appointed, under the law to 
direct the election and guard the purity of elections, have not done their duty. 
The law provides a remedy, by criminal action, against them. They should be 
prosecuted, and the will of the honest voter, as expressed through his ballot, 
should be protected and upheld.</p>
<p>It may be noted in this relation that, under the law, the polls are kept open 
from 7 a.m. until 6 p. m., or, for a period of eleven hours only. In the 
municipality of Binangonan the record shows that there were 375 <span style="font-style: italic;">analfabetos 
</span>(illiterate persons) and 164 other voters. The law requires an <span style="font-style: italic;">analfabeto </span>to 
take an oath and that the oath shall be filed. Naturally the inspectors require 
some time in (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) ascertaining whether or not the voter is in fact an <span style="font-style: italic;">analfabeto</span>; 
and (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) in administering, preparing, signing and filing the oath. Suppose one 
minute only is allowed for that work. Tiien two inspectors must accompany such a 
voter to the booth, there assist him in preparing his ballot and then return to 
their position occupied by them as inspectors. We do not think that work could 
be accomplished in less than another minute and it would more than likely occupy 
nearer two minutes. But admitting that it could be accomplished in one minute, 
we have, at least, two minutes occupied by two inspectors for each <span style="font-style: italic;">analfabeto</span>. 
There being 375 <span style="font-style: italic;">analfabetos</span>, it would require 750 minutes to vote, or 12 1/2 hours. 
If the inspectors had strictly complied with the law, not all of the <span style="font-style: italic;">analfabetos 
</span>of said municipality could have voted in the eleven hours provided by the law, 
not to say anything of the time necessarily occupied with the 164 other voters 
of the municipality who would, at least, occupy one minute each of the time of 
the inspectors, or nearly 2 1/2 hours more. With reference to this particular 
question of the time necessary for each <span style="font-style: italic;">analfabeto </span>to vote, some of the judges 
have estimated that it would take, at least, five minutes of the time of the 
inspectors for each <span style="font-style: italic;">analfabeto</span>. (Hontiveros <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Mobo, R. G. No. 13959, p. 230, 
<span style="font-style: italic;">post</span>)</p>
<p>From the foregoing, it was practically an impossibility for all of the voters 
of said municipality to have voted in the eleven hours prescribed by the law 
even though the polls had been opened promptly at 7 a. m. instead of at nearly 
11 a. m. The above time is computed upon the theory that no time whatever is 
lost, that the voters arrive one immediately after another and that no time is 
lost waiting for the arrival of the voters.</p>
<p>With reference to the second question above presented, the law provides 
that:</p>
<blockquote><p>"A voter otherwise qualified who declares that he can not write, or that from 
blindness or other physical disability he is unable to prepare his ballot, may 
make an oath to the effect that he is so disabled and the nature of his 
disability and that he desires the inspectors to assist him in the preparation 
of such ballot. The board shall keep a record of all such oaths taken and file 
the same with the municipal secretary with the other records of the board after 
the election. Two of the inspectors, each of whom shall belong to a different 
political party, shall ascertain the wishes of the voter, and one of them shall 
prepare the ballot of the voter in proper form according to his wishes, in the 
presence of the other inspector, and out of view of any other person. The 
information thus obtained shall be regarded as a privileged communication." 
(Section 12, Act No. 2045; section 550, Act No. 2657; section 453, Act No. 
2711.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Said quoted section provides the method by which a person who cannot prepare 
his ballot may be assisted. The conditions are:</p>
<blockquote><p>(<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) That he must make an oath to the effect that he is disabled and the 
nature of his disability together with the fact that he desires the inspectors 
to assist him in the preparation of his ballot;</p>
<p>(<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) That a <span style="font-style: italic;">record </span>of said oath shall be <span style="font-style: italic;">filed </span>with the municipal secretary 
with the other records of the board of inspectors after the election; and</p>
<p>(<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>) When said oath is taken, then two of the inspectors, each of whom shall 
belong to different political party, may assist him in the preparation of his 
ballot.</p></blockquote>
<p>In view of said conditions, what shall be the effect of a failure to comply 
therewith? Suppose, for example, that the voter is incapacitated; that the board 
of inspectors are fully aware of that fact; that they failed to require of him 
the oath; that they failed to keep on file the oath taken, or that one inspector 
only assisted said voter in the preparation of his ballot, or that two assisted 
him which belonged to the same party, shall the ballot of such an incapacitated 
person be rejected? Shall all of the votes of the precinct be nullified because 
of the failure of the inspectors to comply strictly with the letter of the 
law?</p>
<p>We held in the case of Paulino <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Cailles (R. G. No. 12753, 37 Phil. Rep., 
825) that the ballots of incapacitated persons who voted without taking the oath 
or were assisted by one inspector alone, or by two belonging to the same party, 
should not be counted if such ballots could be identified. We further held that, 
in the absence of fraud, all of the ballots of the precinct should not be 
invalidated by the mere fact that the inspectors did not comply with their duty. 
Innocent voters should not be deprived of their participation in an election for 
a violation of the law for which they were in no way responsible and which they 
could not prevent.</p>
<p>The incapacitated persons mentioned in said section above noted are usually 
persons who are unable to acquaint themselves with the provisions of the law. 
They are, therefore, absolutely dependent upon the advice and counsel of others. 
Generally, they have no idea whatever as to the form and requirements in casting 
their ballots. Their ignorance, however, does not relieve them from their 
responsibility under the law, nor from the effect of their failure to comply 
therewith. (Manalo <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Sevilla, 24 Phil. Rep., 609; Gardiner <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. De Leon, R. G. 
No. 12382 decided March 15, 1917, not published; Paulino <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Cailles, R. G. No. 
12763, 37 Phil. Rep., 825.)</p>
<p>The law intended that those voters only who are incapacitated in some way 
should be assisted. To insure a compliance with the law an oath of incapacity is 
required. To prove that only such persons have received assistance, the election 
board is required to keep a record of such oath. To guarantee that such voters 
should not be imposed upon, the law wisely provided that two inspectors of 
different political faith should assist them. Upon the other hand, if the 
inspectors have failed or declined to perform a duty or obligation imposed upon 
them by the Election Law, they may be punished.</p>
<p>The record shows that in many of the municipalities of the Province of Rizal, 
during the election in question, a great many incapacitated persons voted 
without taking the oath required and were assisted by one inspector only in the 
preparation of their ballots. But, in view of the fact that such ballots have 
not been identified they cannot be rejected. The voter cannot be punished. The 
remedy is by a criminal action against the inspectors for a failure to comply 
with the law. (Section 29, Act No. 1582; section 2632, Act No. 2657; section 
2639, Act No. 2711.)</p>
<p>Said section (2632) provides, among other things, that any member of a board 
of registration, or board of inspectors, or board of canvassers who willfully 
declines or fails to perform any duty or obligation imposed by the Election Law, 
shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than one month nor more than one 
year, or by a fine of not less than P200 nor more than P500 or both.</p>
<p>With reference to the third question above indicated, relating to what is the 
effect of a failure on the part of the authorities to provide proper voting 
booths, it may be said that we have held in the case of Gardiner vs. Romulo (26 
Phil. Rep., 521) that the requirements of the Election Law providing for the 
location of polling stations and the construction of booths and guard rails for 
the latter may be departed from in some particulars and yet preserve, in 
substantial form, the secrecy which the law requires. But the failure to provide 
doors and guard rails for the booths and the placing of the writing shelf so 
that it faces the side instead of the rear of the booths are, combined, a fatal 
disregard of the law, inasmuch as such an arrangement does not offer, even in 
substantial form, the secrecy and seclusion which, according to the purpose and 
spirit of the Election Law, is its most mandatory requirement.</p>
<p>Section 9 of Act No. 1582, as amended by section 512 of Act No. 2657 and 
section 415 of Act No. 2711, provides that there shall be in each polling place, 
during each election, a sufficient number of voting booths, not less than one 
for every fifty voters, in the election precinct. Said section further provides 
how such voting booths shall be constructed. The purpose of said provisions is 
to furnish each voter an opportunity to prepare his ballot in secrecy. Suppose 
the board of inspectors does not prepare the voting booth in exactly the form 
prescribed by law, what shall be the effect? Suppose, for example, that they 
construct a booth less than one meter square as is provided by the law but yet 
sufficiently large to enable the voter to enter and to prepare his ballot in 
secrecy; or suppose that the door swinging outward to the booth shall extend to 
the floor instead of within fifty centimeters of the floor; or suppose that the 
shelf upon which the voter shall prepare his ballot shall be less than thirty 
centimeters wide, shall the entire election be declared null and void for such 
failures when it is admitted and proved, beyond question, that even with such 
defects in the fulfillment of the requirements of the election law they were in 
fact constructed in a manner which provided the voter a complete opportunity to 
prepare his ballot in absolute secrecy? While there is no provision in the law, 
relating to the construction of booths, that they shall be constructed in such 
manner as to afford the Voter an opportunity to prepare his ballot in secret, 
that <span style="font-style: italic;">must </span>be the primary and ultimate object of having the booths constructed in 
the manner indicated.</p>
<p>When we held that the law requiring the preparation of the booths in a 
particular manner was mandatory, we did not mean to hold that unless they were 
prepared in exact conformity with the law, that the election would be nullified. 
We simply held that if they were not constructed in a manner which afforded the 
voters an opportunity to prepare their ballots in secret, the election would be 
declared null and void on that account. If, however, upon the other hand, the 
booths were so constructed, even though not in strict accord with the provisions 
of the law, as to afford each voter an opportunity to prepare his ballot in 
secret, the election should not be declared null and void. Secrecy is the object 
of the booth. An opportunity to prepare his ballot in private is the purpose of 
the provision. When the booth affords that protection, the purpose of the law is 
fulfilled. To hold otherwise—to establish a different rule—would make the <span style="font-style: italic;">manner 
</span>of performing a public duty more important than the <span style="font-style: italic;">performance </span>of the duty 
itself.</p>
<p>In the present case, while there is some conflict in the evidence, and while 
the proof clearly shows that the booths were not constructed in strict 
accordance with the provisions of the law, we are of the opinion that a large 
preponderance of the evidence shows that the booths were constructed 
(defectively perhaps) in a manner which afforded each voter an opportunity to 
prepare his ballot in absolute secrecy. That being true, we find no reason for 
changing or modifying the conclusion of the lower court.</p>
<p>The defendant-appellant alleges, and attempts to establish the fact, that in 
the municipality of San Felipe Nery many irregularities were committed which 
should invalidate the election. For example, he alleges the different columns of 
the polling list were not properly filled. Even granting that fact, the voter 
was in no way responsible. The voter not being responsible, his ballot should 
not be nullified on that account. Filling the different columns of the polling 
list is a duty imposed upon the election officers. If they fail to perform their 
duty they are responsible; and as we have frequently said, the ballots of 
innocent voters should not be nullified for a failure on the part of election 
officers to perform their duty in accordance with the provisions of the law. The 
remedy is a criminal action against the inspectors if they have violated the law 
and not to nullify the votes of innocent voters.</p>
<p>The defendant-appellant further alleges that in the municipality of San 
Felipe Nery, a number of voters voted who were not residents of said 
municipality. That question was presented to the court below, and upon a full 
consideration he refused to nullify the election in said municipality upon the 
grounds alleged. While it is true that the proof shows that some grave 
irregularities were committed by the board of inspectors, we are not persuaded 
that the evidence is sufficient to justify this court in nullifying the entire 
vote of said municipality. In view of that conclusion, we deem it unnecessary to 
discuss the other allegations of the defendant-appellant with reference to the 
striking out of certain allegations in his answer.</p>
<p>The lower court, after hearing the evidence and after examining the ballots 
cast in the municipality of Taytay, found that 50 ballots which had been counted 
for the defendant-appellant should not be counted for him and ordered that the 
total vote of the defendant-appellant should be reduced by that number. The 
defendant-appellant in fact admits that the said 50 votes should be deducted 
from his total vote. In view of that admission of the defendant-appellant, we 
deem it unnecessary to discuss the reasons therefor.</p>
<p>Upon the various errors assigned, our conclusions are:</p>
<blockquote><p>(1) That the total votes cast in the municipality of Binangonan should be 
counted for the respective candidates; that for the special reasons given, the 
board of inspectors was justified in keeping the polls open after the hour for 
closing. But this conclusion must not be interpreted to mean that under <span style="font-style: italic;">other 
circumstances and other conditions</span>, where the polls are kept open after the hour 
<span style="font-style: italic;">for fraudulent purposes</span>, that such act on the part of the inspectors might not 
nullify the entire election (Gardiner vs. Romulo, 26 Phil. Rep., 521) ;</p>
<p>(2) That while it is irregular for the board of inspectors to permit 
incapacitated voters to vote without taking the oath and for one inspector only 
to assist such voters, yet the ballots of the innocent voters should not be 
nullified on that account; that the ballots of such persons only should be 
annulled when identified;</p>
<p>(3) That inasmuch as the voting booths in the municipality of Antipolo were 
prepared in a manner and form which permitted the voter to prepare his ballot in 
absolute secrecy, the vote of that municipality should not be nullified ; 
and</p>
<p>(4) That the judgment of the lower court reducing the total vote of the 
defendant-appellant by fifty identified fraudulent ballots counted for him, in 
the municipality of Taytay, should be affirmed.</p></blockquote>
<p>As a result of the count of the ballots, cast in the various municipalities 
by the provincial board of inspectors, Eulogio Rodriguez received 4,321 votes, 
Jose Lino Luna received 4,157 votes and Servando de los Angeles received 3,576 
votes. Servando de los Angeles did not protest the election. From all of the 
foregoing, the total votes of Eulogio Rodriguez must be reduced by 50 votes, 
leaving him a total of 4,271 only, or a clear majority of 114 votes.</p>
<p>Therefore, with the modification herein indicated, the judgment of the lower 
court is affirmed as modified, and it is hereby ordered and decreed that the 
record be immediately returned to the lower court with direction that a judgment 
be entered directing and ordering the provincial board of inspectors to amend 
its count accordingly.</p>
<p>It is so ordered, without any finding as to costs.</p>
