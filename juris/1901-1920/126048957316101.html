				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The defendants  Exequiel  Castillo and  Catalino  Circa were charged in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Nueva Ecija with the crime of robbery and murder, committed as follows:</p>
<p> That on a night in the month of  January, 1900, in the pueblo of Carranglan, Province of Nueva  Ecija,  Dona Joaquina de Castro, being asleep in her house, where the defendant, (her nephew) Exequiel Castillo lived with her, the defendant, moved by the iniquitous desire of  approprinting the property of the deceased, struck her a blow on the head with a piece of  wood, which caused  her instantaneous death; that he requested Catalino Circa to proceed to the burial of the body, and the latter dug a  grave near the house of  the deceased and buried her.  The defendant Exequiel Castillo paid Catalino Circa the sum of $10 for lending his assistance.</p>
<p> The defendant Exequiel Castillo was convicted and sentenced to the penalty of death as the author of the crime, and  the  defendant Catalino Circa was sentenced to  ten years of <em>presidio mayor</em> as an accessory after the fact.</p>
<p> The defendant Exequiel Castillo  has appealed to this court.</p>
<p> Catalino Circa does not appeal from the judgment.</p>
<p> The proof offered by the Government at the trial against Exequiel Castillo consists of confessions made by  Catalino Circa  to various persons, and of the latter's  statements made  on the preliminary investigation before  the provincial fiscal. It will be unnecessary to review  this testimony.</p>
<p> On the trial of the case the defendant Catalino Circa testified in behalf of defendants and contradicted the truth of these statements, claiming that he was induced to make them by Agustin Castro,  a brother of the deceased, and denying  all knowledge whatever of the commission  of  the offense.</p>
<p> The judge of the  Court of First Instance took into consideration  these confessions  and the testimony given on the preliminary  investigation, and found the  defendants guilty under  this proof.<br>
</p>
<p> Section 15 of General Orders,  No. 58, provides that in all criminal prosecutions the defendant shall  be entitled to be confronted at the trial by  and to cross-examine the witnesses against him.</p>
<p> This right has been denied the defendant Exequiei Castillo.</p>
<p> Neither the confessions of Catalino Circa nor his testimony  given on  the preliminary hearing, can be  received against Exequiei Castillo, and the Court of  First Instance erred in admitting them.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "Where the testimony  of a witness for the prosecution has previously been taken down by   question and answer in the presence  of  the accused or  his counsel, the defense having had  an opportunity to cross-examine the  witness, the deposition of the latter may be read, upon satisfactory proof to the court that he  is dead or insane, or can not with due diligence  be found in  the Islands."   (Sec. 15,  General Orders, No. 58.) In no other cases than those specified in this section can the testimony introduced  at the preliminary examination be received at the trial. We  have  heretofore decided,  and have directed the attention of judges of the  Courts of First Instance to the fact, that the testimony  taken  on a preliminary  investigation can not be received at the trial of the cause unless falling within one  of these exceptions.  The preliminary proof has no place in  the  record sent to this court.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> The  proof stands upon a different ground  with reference to Catalino Circa.  His confessions made to  witnesses may be admissible against him.  But they are not admissible against his codefendant.   It is unnecessary to consider the sufficiency of these confessions as  against Catalino Circa. He has not  appealed  from  the  judgment.<br>
  <br>
The  judgment of the Court of First Instance convicting and sentencing the defendant Exequiei Castillo to the death penalty is reversed and defendant Castillo is  acquitted and directed to  be  discharged, without prejudice  to that part of the judgment convicting "and sentencing the defendant Catalino  Circa to the  penalty  in which lie  is condemned. It is so ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C.  J., Willard, Mapa, </em>and <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p>  <em>Torres, J.,</em> did not sit in  this case.</p>
