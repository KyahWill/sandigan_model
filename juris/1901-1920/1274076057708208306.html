				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On July 17, 1876, Don Felipe Llopis, by a public document, acknowledged a 
debt of eight hundred and thirty-nine pesos in favor of Don Tomas G. Gonzalez 
San Robles, giving as security for his debt a mortgage on a parcel of land owned 
by him. Don Tomas G. Gonzalez San Robles assigned his credit in favor of Don 
Justo Guivara, who, in turn, assigned it to Don Manuel Nieto. On February 18, 
1902, Don Manuel Nieto, the last assignee of the credit of eight hundred and 
thirty-nine pesos against Llopis, instituted an action to foreclose the mortgage 
on the real estate which had already been surrendered to him by its owner in 
order to satisfy the debt, with the interest thereon. On the 21st day of May, 
1902, the court rendered judgment by default against the debtor, Llopis, and on 
August 12 of the same year the land was sold on execution by the sheriff of 
Manila for the sum of ten thousand pesos to said plaintiff, Nieto, whose claim 
was for a larger sum. The same day, August 12, 1902, Macaria Asuncion, the 
debtor's widow, and his children, Candido, Felisa, and Ricardo Bias Llopis, 
filed a motion to stay the execution and at the same time to declare the right 
of foreclosure exercised by Nieto extinguished and that all the subsequent 
proceedings in the case, including the attachment of the property, be also 
declared null and void on the following ground: That the debtor, Llopis, died 
long before the executory action was taken against him by his creditor, Nieto; 
that the petitioners at the time the action was brought in May, 1902, resided in 
the town of Mariquina, and, there being no means of communication between that 
town and this city, they could not come to Manila, and, finally, that Felipe 
Llopis died on the Island of Jolo in the year 1883, according to use burial 
certificate which was put on record in the case. The court declared the 
subsequent proceedings null and void and that the defendant had a right to 
continue in possession of the property until the plaintiffs should pay to him 
the sum of one thousand five hundred and eighty-two pesos with the legal 
interest from the date of the judgment, and after payment was made by the 
plaintiffs they be put in possession of the property from which the defendant 
should be ousted in such case.
<p>The action taken by Nieto was, therefore, brought twenty years after the 
death of the defendant debtor and yet this defendant was summoned by publication 
and the case was tried <em>ex parte</em> because of his default, when the 
creditor could very well have gotten information from Llopis's family as to the 
whereabouts of the latter, if it be true that he really was in ignorance of his 
death. As he did not endeavor to obtain the information, assumed the risk of the 
results of his action, and acted with notorious carelessness, because the widow 
and children of the debtor were alive and we'll known, and he can not allege 
that he was in ignorance of the whereabouts of the latter. This is a different 
case from that provided for in section 398 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 
Granting that with the assignment of that credit Nieto was subrogated to all the 
rights under it, including the mortgage on the property (art. 1528, Civil Code) 
and granting that the right to foreclose the mortgage had not been extinguished, 
still the action should have been brought against the administrator or the legal 
representatives of the debtor. Nieto did not do so, however, and brought his 
action against Felipe Llopis, who had been dead for the last twenty years, and 
obtained judgment by default, in express violation of the strict provisions of 
sections 114 and 708 of the Code of Civil Procedure. This nullifies the whole 
proceeding. Had section 255 of the Code of Civil Procedure been complied with, 
the proceeding would not have been null and void, as is the case now. Section 
255 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that in an action for foreclosure of 
a mortgage on real estate, or, rather, an incumbrance on real estate, the 
complaint shall set forth, among other things, the names and residence of the 
mortgagors and mortgagees. This has not been complied with by Nieto, because, 
without having used any diligence to learn the whereabouts of Llopis, he risked 
the statement that he did not know, when he could not be ignorant of the fact 
that he had been banished to the Island of Jolo, At all events, Llopis's family 
could have informed him. For this reason he should not have obtained judgment by 
default against the defendant, because service of the summons should have been 
made personally upon him. (Sees. 391, 394, and 396, Code of Civil 
Procedure.)</p>
<p>The question In this case is not to set aside the judgment and grant a new 
trial on the ground stated in section 145 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The 
widow and heirs of the deceased, Llopis, ask to have the case dismissed and the 
attachment of the real estate declared null and void, because it was made 
without previously summoning and hearing the legal representative" of the 
.estate of the deceased debtor. The widow and heirs of the deceased Llopis, were 
not summoned or heard nor did they intervene as parties in the suit brought by 
Nieto against the said Llopis, and, therefore, if the proceedings and judgment 
can not be sustained against him, much less can they be sustained against those 
who have not appeared in the suit.</p>
<p>From the proceedings in this case it appears in an in contestable manner that 
besides the mortgage existing on the property attached this property had been 
surrendered to the creditor by the debtor, perhaps by virtue of a contract of 
antichresis. But it also appears that the counsel for the appellees, without 
having interposed any proceedings against the said judgment, asks in his brief 
in this second instance that the judgment be affirmed, as it is in accordance 
with the principles of justice. Taking into consideration the provisions of 
section 496 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and by virtue of the reasons stated, 
it is our opinion that the appealed judgment of December 24, 1902, should be 
affirmed, with the costs to the appellant, and that after the term of ten days 
from this date judgment be rendered accordingly. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C, J., Mapa, Johnson,</em> and <em>Carson, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p>
