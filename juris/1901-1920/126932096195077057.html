				G.R. No. 8942, December 19, 1914</h4>
				<H3>TEOFILO R. TORRALBA, ROBERTO VILLELA AND JOSEFA BILLONES, PETITIONERS AND APPELLANTS, VS. TOMAS DEJAN, AMBROSIA DEJAN, MAGDALENA DEJAN AND MARTINIANO SILARIA, OBJECTORS AND APPELLEES.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This was a proceeding for the legalization of the will of Hilaria Dejan. The 
petition for legalization was presented on the 29th of October 1912. The 
legalization was opposed by the defendants and appellees.
<p>After hearing the respective parties, the lower court found that said 
pretended will was not authentic and denied the petition for the legalization of 
the same. From that decision the petitioners appealed to this court and made 
several assignments of error. The first assignment of error is that the lower 
court committed an error in not making a finding of facts upon which his 
conclusions were based, in accordance with section 133, and others, of the Code 
of Procedure in Civil Actions.</p>
<p>We have held in numerous cases that the lower court, in deciding cases 
involving the determination of issues of fact, must make a written finding of 
facts upon which he based his conclusions. (Braga <em>vs.</em> Millora, 3 Phil. 
Rep., 458; Enriquez <em>vs.</em> Enriquez, 3 Phil. Rep., 746; Early <em>vs.</em> 
Sy-Giang, 4 Phil. Rep., 727; City of Manila <em>vs.</em> Insular Government, 9 
Phil. Rep., 71; Gavieres <em>vs.</em> Admr. of Pe√±a, 13 Phil. Rep., 449; Aringo 
<em>vs</em>. Arena, 14 Phil. Rep., 263; Alindogan <em>vs.</em> Insular 
Government, 15 Phil. Rep., 168; Montelibano <em>vs.</em> Director of Lands, 21 
Phil. Rep., 449,; Galves <em>vs.</em> Causing et al., R. G. No. 9262, not 
reported.)</p>
<p>For the reason that the lower court failed to comply with section 133 of Act 
No. 190, in making a finding of facts upon which he based his conclusions, it is 
hereby ordered and decreed that the record be remanded to the lower court, with 
direction that the judge thereof make a finding of facts based upon the proof 
already presented, and return such finding to this court, together with the 
record, within a period of thirty days from the receipt of this order. And 
without any finding as to costs, it is so ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Carson, Moreland,</em> and <em>Araullo, 
JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em>Trent, J.,</em> dissents.<br></p></div>
