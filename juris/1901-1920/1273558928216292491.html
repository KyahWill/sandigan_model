				<BR><STRONG>PAREDES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Defendants Tobias and Isidora Gabion were convicted of killing the husband of Isidora.&nbsp; The wife was sentenced to death, and the other defendant to life imprisonment.&nbsp; The latter did not appeal, and the case was brought up for review of the death penalty.&nbsp; Defendants were given the benefits of reasonable doubt as the alleged crime is claimed to have been committed in 1901, and the information was not presented until nine years later.&nbsp; Nor was it shown how the case came to the knowledge of the prosecuting officer, and the only evidence produced was the testimony of one witness.&nbsp; Judgment reversed and defendant Isidora acquitted.&nbsp; No conclusion reached with respect to the defendant who did not appeal.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Per Torres, J.</span></div>
