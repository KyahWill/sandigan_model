				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The plaintiffs brought this action under the provisions of Act No. 1376  to  recover  the  possession  of certain churches, convents, cemeteries, and other real and personal property situated  in different  municipalities in the Province  of  Ilocos Norte.   The  complaint  alleged  among others things ownership of the property described therein by the plaintiffs and their right to the possession thereto. Within the time required by the  act an answer was presented by counsel, who signed,  themselves "abogados de la parte  demandada."  This  answer contained  a general denial of each  and every allegation of the complaint and. set out also several affirmative  defenses.</p>
<p>In  May,  1906, the plaintiffs made a motion in which they asked  that the court declare admitted and true the allegations contained  in  the complaint, order  the dispossession of the defendants, and that the possession  of the  property  described in the complaint be returned  to the plaintiffs on the ground that no one of the defendants had presented an answer in conformity with section 4  of the said act.  That section is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"SEC.  4. Within forty days  after service of the summons on the defendant or  defendants,  unless  further time  is given  by the court, the defendant or defendants served shall file their several  answers or  a joint answer, as they may elect, succinctly  stating the  facts upon  which  they base their interest and deny the ownership or  the  right of administration or possession or claim of title of the petitioner or petitioners, and stating to what use the  property claimed or held by such  defendant or defendants has been put while in the  possession of the defendant or defendants, and for what period of time it has been so used and whether such property is used or ever has been used by the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church  as a church, convent, or cemetery, or in connection therewith, and  if so, for what period of time.   Upon the filing of such answer or answers no further  pleading shall be necessary and the action shall be considered at issue.   In the event that any defendant fails to file  his answer  to  the petition within the time hereby prescribed, the allegations of the petition shall be taken as confessed and true  as to  him, and the court shall at once enter a decree  directing  the return of the personal property  and ousting such defendant  from possession of  the real  property described in the petition and  held by him and,  if requested, shall  issue a writ of possession in accordance with the decree  *   *  *."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If this act allows the defendants to insert in their answer a general denial of the, allegations contained in  the  complaint, the" motion must be denied. There  is  nothing in section 4 which expressly prohibits  such a denial.  By the terms of the act the defendants are required to deny the ownership or the right  of administration or  possession or claim of title of the plaintiff, but  that should not be so construed as to prevent them from denying  other allegations of the complaint.  In fact, if  a general denial is not permissible under this section, then a  specific denial of any particular  fact alleged in the complaint would not be permissible with the exception of the limited denial mentioned in the section itself.  For example, this complaint alleges  that the plaintiffs are the owners of five lots situated in  the  pueblo of  Dingras, not alleging that  these tracts of land are in any way connected with any church, convent, or cemetery; it also alleges that these lots are in the possession of certain of the defendants.   If no general or specific denial is admissible, the defendants would be precluded from denying  that they were in  possession of these tracts of land.</p>
<p>Every system of judicial procedure presupposes in the pleadings allegations on one side and admissions or denials on the other.  The issues to be tried are necessarily raised by denials; there  can be  no  issue  unless  something is alleged  on the one hand and denied on the other, and no law establishing a special  procedure for a  certain  class of cases should be so construed as to prohibit a denial by the defendant of allegations of the complaint, unless the law contains  a distinct  and unequivocal prohibition of that character.   Section 9 of the  act gives this  court jurisdiction to determine actions involving the title to certain hospitals, asylums,  and charitable institutions as to which the Government and the Roman Catholic Church make opposing claims of ownership.  The same procedure is provided in such actions as is provided in this action. It can not be conceived  that in an action brought to try the title to any one of these hospitals or charitable institutions the legislative body intended that the only denial of the facts alleged in the complaint  which the defendant was allowed to make was a mere denial of the ownership of the plaintiff and an allegation  of his own  right to possession.  We  hold  that the general  denial  contained in the answer above referred to was and is sufficient.</p>
<p>Upon its face the answer above referred to is the answer for all of the defendants in this action.  There are in the record,  however, other answers presented by certain of the defendants.   Whether these answers are all of them sufficient  we have not stopped to inquire, for the reason that as we construe the motion  of the plaintiffs it is a motion to strike out all the answers, and if any one answer is good the motion would have to be denied.</p>
<p>The answers are defective in not containing some of the allegations required by said  section 4, but if the plaintiffs desired  to secure the benefit of admissions which might result  from compliance  with that section,  they should have made a motion requiring the defendants to amend their answers so as to comply with the law in that respect.</p>
<p>The defendant, Aglipay, and the municipality of Dingras made a motion in June asking that all the proceedings in the case be declared null  and void and the said Act No. 1376 unconstitutional.  This objection  the  defendants have set forth as  a special defense in their answer.   The question should, therefore, be tried and decided when the case  is tried upon its merits and we decline to consider it now.</p>
<p>The motion of the plaintiffs, as well as the  motion of the defendant Aglipay and the municipality of Dingras, is denied.  So ordered.</p>
<em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa,</em> and <em>Carson, JJ., </em>concur.<br>

<em>CONCURRING IN THE RESULT</em></div>
<p><strong>TRACEY, J.: </strong></p>
<p>As I  read Act No.  1376, the specification of allegations to be set forth in the several pleadings in these actions was inserted for the purpose of securing truth and precision in the issues to be tried.  To sanction a general denial which is not in terms provided  for does not seem conducive to that object.  For  instance, the defendant Aglipay in his answer denies generally not only  the jurisdictional character of the  plaintiff bishops, but also the fact that he himself is  the chief bishop  of the Independent Filipino.. Church.  To give  formal  effect to this denial, which appears not altogether consistent with the remainder of his pleadings not only beclouds the issue, but  may work a result not contemplated by the pleader.  Nor is such effect necessary.  All the  facts  required by  the statute to be stated in the petition would be put in  issue by the form of answer prescribed by this law.   Any other facts contained in the petition should be traversed specially rather than generally, so as to bring the dispute to a precise point, as designed by the statute.</p>
<p>There are, however, specific denials and affirmative allegations in  some of the answers sufficient to raise issues, thereby defeating  plaintiffs' motion and  remitting the parties to trial upon the merits; such a trial is the result obviously aimed at by the law.  The questions in controversy are too important to be disposed of on mere motion without adequate argument, briefs, or evidence.</p>
<p>For the foregoing reasons I concur in the result of Mr. Justice  Willard's opinion.<br>
