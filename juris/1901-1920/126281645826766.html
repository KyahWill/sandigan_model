				<H3>JUAN MOLINA ADMINISTRATOR OF THE ESTATE OF ANASTASIO MORA, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. LA ELECTRICISTA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MAPA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The plaintiff in this case alleges that he is the administrator of the estate of Anastasio  Mora.  In his capacity as such he brought this  action to  recover from the defendant  the sum of 6,000 pesos as damages for the death of the said Mora,  who he claims  was killed through  the fault and negligence of the said defendant.   The latter demurred to the complaint on the ground that it did not set out facts sufficient  to constitute a cause of action.  On the 24th of July, 1905,  the court made an order sustaining the demurrer and directing that the case be dismissed.  On the 28th of the said month of July  the plaintiff excepted to this  ruling  of the court and  at the same time asked that it be modified so as to permit  him to amend his complaint, which  petition he  reiterated  on the 17th  of August, attaching thereto an amended  complaint.  This motion of the plaintiff was overruled on the 26th of August.  He thereupon excepted to the order of the court overruling said motion and gave notice of his intention to prosecute a bill of exceptions, which he subsequently presented within the time prescribed by  law.</p>
<p>Section 101 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions provides in part as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"When a demurrer to  any pleading is sustained,  the party  whose  pleading is  thus adjudged  defective may amend his  pleading  within a time  to be fixed by the court,  with or without terms, as to the court  shall seem just  *  *  *."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under the above-quoted provision when the demurrer in this case was sustained the court should  have given the plaintiff an opportunity to  amend his  complaint, fixing a reasonable time for this purpose instead of dismissing the action,  because  the right of the plaintiff to  amend  his complaint in such cases is expressly recognized  by the provisions of  the above section of  the  Code of  Civil Procedure.  That section  provides  that  "the party  whose pleading is  thus adjudged defective <em>may amend</em> his pleading  *  * *.  The  ruling of the court below upon this point was obviously erroneous.</p>
<p>The  question as to  whether the demurrer was properly or improperly sustained it is not necessary for us to decide, because although the plaintiff excepted to the order of the 24th of July,  1905, sustaining the demurrer to  the complaint, still we think he abandoned his exception when he reiterated his  petition to the court that he be  allowed  to amend  his  complaint.  This  petition,  in  our  judgment, necessarily  implied that the plaintiff had no objection  to the demurrer  being sustained.  If the  court  below had granted plaintiff's  petition allowing him  to  amend his complaint, the case would have not been sent to this court on appeal, this being all that the said plaintiff  apparently wished to do after the demurrer had been  sustained.  In such case he would have obtained what he sought by his motion, and consequently there would have been no ground for his appeal.  The order of the court below  made and entered on  the 26th of August, 1905, is hereby  reversed and the plaintiff is allowed five days within which to amend his complaint if  he so desires.  After  the expiration of twenty days let judgment be entered in accordance herewith and ten days thereafter let the case be remanded to the court below for execution.  So ordered.</p>
