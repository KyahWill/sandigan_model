				G.R. No. 3949, October 19, 1907</h4>
				<H3>THE  UNITED  STATES,  PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. GABINO SORIANO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This defendant was charged with the crime of larceny in the Court of First Instance of  the Province of Occiden- tal Negros, was  found guilty as accessory to  the  crime of theft,  and was sentenced to pay  a fine of 1,875 pesetas, with costs, and in case of insolvency to suffer subsidiary imprisonment  at the  rate of 12Â½  pesetas  for each day, the subsidiary imprisonment not to exceed six months.</p>
<p>The lower court also found that the defendant had been convicted and  sentenced  for the crime of larceny in four other cases pending in that court.</p>
<p>From this sentence the defendant appealed to this court.</p>
<p>The only question submitted by the proof presented by the attorney  for  the appellant  is whether  or not  the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause in  the lower court is sufficient  to show that the  defendant was guilty of the crime for which he was convicted.</p>
<p>An  examination of the evidence brought to this  court shows beyond  peradventure of doubt that on  or  about the 17th day of December,  1904, some person stole  from Rafael Medel a carabao of the value of P100; that on or about the 21st  day of December, 1904, the defendant had the carabao in question  registered with  the  municipal treasurer of the pueblo  of Silay; that on or about the 9th day of January, 1905, the defendant sold the caralmo in question to  one Buenaventura Lopez for the sum of P100; that the said carabao was found in the possession of the said Lopez  and was recovered  from him by the Constabulary of said province for its original owner.</p>
<p>The defendant admitted that he  had  obtained the  registration of said carabao on the 21st day of December, 1904,  with the municipal treasurer of the pueblo of Silay, and attempted to show that he had been the  owner of the carabao  in question  since the month of January, 1901, and that he had purchased the same in the latter year of some  one unknown in the municipality  of Pontevedra.</p>
<p>The fact  that the carabao in question belonged  to the said Medel  and was stolen  from him  on or about  the 7th day  of  December,  1904, was proven beyond  peradventure of doubt;  therefore the contention of the defendant that he  had been the owner of the said carabao from the month of January, 1901, until the 9th day of  January. 1905,  when  he  sold the same to  the said  Lopez, can  not be true.   The fact that the defendant,  according  to his own statement, had not registered the said carabao until a few days after the said larceny is sufficient to convince us that his testimony can not be believed.  His possession and sale of  the carabao in question, a few days  after the larceny, in the absence of any valid explanation, convinces us that he was  guilty of  the crime charged  in  the  said complaint.</p>
<p>It is therefore  the judgment of this court  that  the sentence  of  the lower  court: be modified, and  that  the defendant be sentenced  to be imprisoned for  a period of six months of <em>arresto mayor</em>, to  indemnify the  said Buenaventura Lopez in the sum of P100, and in case of insolvency to  suffer subsidiary imprisonment, which shall  not exceed one-third of the penalty  of imprisonment imposed, and to pay the  costs.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Carson, Willard, </em>and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
