				<H3>UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. CHAN GUY JUAN (ALIAS CHINO AUA), DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.

				<BR><STRONG>TRENT, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The facts in this case, are these:&nbsp; On the morning of the 26th&nbsp; of May, 1910, the steamer <em>Ton-Yek</em> anchored in the Bay&nbsp; of Calbayog, Samar.&nbsp; A&nbsp; Chinaman named Lee&nbsp; See <em>(alias</em> Tuya), one of the passengers, disembarked and went to the house of the appellant, Chan Guy Juan (<em>alias</em> Aua) in the town&nbsp; of Calbayog, where the two had a somewhat lengthy conversation.&nbsp; Lee See returned to the boat&nbsp; and the appellant employed one Isidro Cabinico to go alongside of the steamer with his <em>baroto</em> and receive from the said Lee See a certain sack containing, as the appellant said sugar. On arriving at the steamer, Lee See, who was on deck, tied a&nbsp; rope around the&nbsp; sack&nbsp; and lowered&nbsp; it&nbsp; into&nbsp; Cabinico's <em>barato</em>.&nbsp; The latter, while on his way to the house of the appellant with the sack and its contents, was arrested and the contents&nbsp; of the sack examined, and found to consist of a small amount of sugar and twenty-eight cans of opium. This&nbsp; opium was confiscated by the local authorities and separate criminal charges instituted against the two Chinamen and Cabinico. Upon&nbsp; investigation&nbsp; by the&nbsp; provincial fiscal, the case against&nbsp; Cabinico was dismissed, while those against the two Chinamen were proceeded with, resulting, in the conviction of both.&nbsp; Both appealed, and the sentence imposed upon Lee See has heretofore been affirmed by this court.<br>&nbsp; <br>It&nbsp; clearly&nbsp; appears from the record that&nbsp; Cabinico&nbsp; did not know the contents&nbsp; of the sack which he received from Lee See and which he&nbsp; was on his way&nbsp; to&nbsp; deliver to&nbsp; the appellant.&nbsp; It is insisted that it can not be said, under these facts, that&nbsp; the appellant had possession or control of the twenty-eight cans of opium.&nbsp; It is true that the appellant never had actual physical possession of&nbsp; the opium, but it must be remembered that&nbsp; while&nbsp; he employed Cabinico to go to the steamer and receive, as he said, a certain amount of sugar from his countryman Lee See and bring the same to him, he knew that the sack which Cabinico would receive contained very&nbsp; little sugar and a large quantity of opium. <br></div><div align="justify"><br></div><div align="justify">The expression "having possession of" in section&nbsp; 31&nbsp; of Act No. 1761 is somewhat ambiguous.&nbsp; It is clear that the law never intended to hold a person guilty of the possession of the prescribed drug when in fact&nbsp; he merely had&nbsp; the custody of the&nbsp; same without knowledge of its nature, and this court so held in disposing of the case against Cabinico. But&nbsp; it is equally clear that the law never intended&nbsp; the possession of the drug&nbsp; should be&nbsp; limited to mere manual touch or personal custody.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon&nbsp; such a&nbsp; holding, a guilty principal could often escape by taking the precaution&nbsp; to never have the drug in&nbsp; his actual&nbsp; possession, and thus defeat&nbsp; the intent&nbsp; of the law.&nbsp;&nbsp; The words "having possession of" must therefore be extended to include constructive possession ; that is, the relation between the owner of the drug and the&nbsp; drug itself when the owner is not in actual physical. possession, but&nbsp; when it&nbsp; is still under his control and management and subject to his disposition.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is&nbsp; immaterial whether Lee See or Chan Guy Juan was&nbsp; the real owner of the opium found in the sack of sugar.&nbsp; The evidence shows both were guilty principals in the&nbsp; effort to land the opium from the steamer.<br>&nbsp; <br>Cabinico was the innocent agent of the defendant in this case, and the responsibility for carrying the opium ashore therefore reverts to this defendant.&nbsp; (Art. 13, No. 2,&nbsp; Penal Code; 12 Cyc, 185, and cases cited; Bishop's New Criminal Law, vol. 1, sec. 651.)<br>&nbsp; <br>The judgment of the. lower court is therefore affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.<br>&nbsp; <br><em>Arellano,&nbsp; C. J., Mapa, Johnso</em><em>n</em>,&nbsp; and <em>Carson, JJ.</em>, concur.<br></div>
