				G.R. No. 3119, December 20, 1906</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. ESTANISLAO CAGAOAAN  ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The guilt of the accused of the  crime  of "robbery <em>en cuadrilla</em>" with  which  they  were  charged, was  proven beyond a reasonable doubt and we  find no  error in the proceedings  prejudicial  to the rights of the accused.   The trial court properly held the offense  committed to  be  that of robbery <em>en cuadrilla</em>, as defined and penalized in articles 504 and 505 of the Penal Code, taken together with paragraph 5 of article 503, marked with the aggravating circumstances that the crime was committed at nighttime and in the house' of the offended persons.</p>
<p>The accused, Estanislao Cagaoaan and  Tiburcio  Cagaoaan, were sentenced to the penalty of ten years' imprisonment,  and  their five  codefendants  to  the penalty of eight years' imprisonment, but the robbery  having been committed <em>en cuadrilla</em>, the penalty which should have been imposed is that of the maximum degree of "<em>presidio correccional</em> to <em>presidio mayor</em> in its medium degree," and in view of the aggravating circumstances this penalty should have been imposed upon all in  its maximum degree.   The principal penalty that  should have been imposed was, therefore, "from eight years eleven months and eleven days <em>presidio mayor</em>"  to "ten years  <em>presidio mayor</em>"</p>
<p>It may be well to note that  the English translation of the Penal Code,  published at  the Government  Printing Office in Washington, in 1900, translates article 504 so as to read as follows: "If the crimes referred to in Nos. 3, 4,  and 5 of the foregoing article should have been committed in an uninhabited place and by a gang," etc.; while the correct translation is as follows: "If the crimes referred to in Nos. 3, 4, and 5 of  the foregoing article should have been committed in an uninhabited place or by a gang," etc.</p>
<p>The judgment and sentence is modified by imposing the principal penalty of ten years' <em>presidio mayor</em> upon all the appellants instead of the penalty of ten years' imprisonment imposed by the sentence on Estanislao Cagaoaan  and Tiburcio  Cagaoaan,  and  eight years' imprisonment  on their five codefendants, and thus modified the judgment  and sentence of the trial court is affirmed, with the proportionate share  of the costs of this instance against each of the appellants.  After expiration of ten days let judgment be entered in accordance herewith and ten days thereafter the case remanded to the court below for proper action.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Willard,</em> and  <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
