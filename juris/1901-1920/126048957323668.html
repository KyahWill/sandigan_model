				<BR><STRONG>MAPA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> It sufficiently  appears from the record  that the defendants, at the time in question, went to the house  of Juan Rodriguez,  alleged  to have  been broken  into, with the intent of making an  entrance there at all cost, even against the will of the said Juan Rodriguez.  It does not, however, appear  to be certain  that they did in  fact succeed  in entering, as the record is not very explicit upon this point. Jt is evident that they succeeded in entering the first door of the house,  either violently by breaking it open, as alleged by the complainant, or because they found it already open, as testified by the defendant  Bartolome Ostrea.   It does not  appear, however, whether this  door  formed an integral part of the house or whether, on the contrary, it was an outer door, separate and independent from the body of the house.  We  are inclined to  believe that  the latter is the fact, in view of the testimony in the case.   The complainant calls this  first  door  the  <em>front</em>  door,  and adds tliat upon seeing it had  been  broken by the accused he immediately closed  the. second door and <em>did  not  allow them  to enter his house.</em>   In another part of his testimony he states that when  they (the accused) saw that <em>they could not enter  the  house</em> they  went away.   The other  witness for the prosecution, Benigno Sebastian, testifies that Bartolome Ostrea called to his wife, who was in the house, but that <em>he could not get in</em>, because the doors were closed. Bni'tolome Ostrea, on his part, in his testimony at the trial says that  the first door was open, and that the following door <em>at the  entrance to the house</em> was closed.  From this statement it would appear that the second door was that at the entrance to the house in question.</p>
<p> In view of the terms in  which these witnesses expressed themselves and the,  luck of other more precise data in the record it  may be  concluded that, notwithstanding the fact that  the defendants  entered the first door, they did not succeed  in entering the house.   It is possible that this conclusion is  not in conformity with  the  facts as they really occurred, but it is the legal conclusion from the data disclosed by the record and upon which alone we must rely for our decision.</p>
<p> In  consequence,  the defendants are only responsible for the crime of an attempted forcible entry into the dwelling, and not for a  consummated entry, as  considered by the court  below in  the judgment appealed.  It has been proven that in the execution of  tins act the defendants employed violence and intimidation, and for nearly half an hour tried to push open the door at the entrance  to the house, and that Bartolome Ostrea fired several shots from his revolver upon seeing that Rodriguez  refused to open the door.   The latter says that Ostrea fired three or four shots.  The other witnesses for the prosecution only heard one. It is a matter of indifference, however, whether one or more shots were fired for the purposes of considering the circumstance of intimidation, more especially in view of the fact that Bartolome himself admits that he discharged the revolver which he carried, although he adds that he only fired  in the air.</p>
<p> The concurrence of this circumstance brings the  act in question  within the sanction of paragraph  2 of article 491 of the Penal Code.  In favor of the accused we must consider   the  mitigating  circumstance  of  drunkenness (No, 6 of art. 9 of the Penal Code), as it appears from the testimony of the complainant himself  and that of Benigno Sebastian that  they  were drunk  at the time in question, and that they are not habitual drunkards.  In the present case we must also consider as mitigating the circumstance that the complainant, Juan Rodriguez, is the father-in-law of Bartolome Ostrea, by virtue of the provisions of paragraph 1 of article 10, for, in view of this close relationship, it is  not considered that the defendant would regard himself as a stranger in  the home of  the complainant, to which  it is to be presumed  he ordinarily had free access as  a member  of the Rodriguez family.  The fact, sufficiently proven in the  case,  that he believed his wife, the daughter of the said Rodriguez, was in the house at the time in question, may also have  contributed to lead him to believe, although erroneously,  that he had a right to enter the house.</p>
<p> Upon the grounds set forth, and in view of the provisions of articles 66 and 75, paragraphs of  article 91, and article 92 of the Penal Code, we condemn each of the defendants to a fine of 325 pesetas, or to subsidiary imprisonnient, in case of nonpayment, at the  rate of one day for each 12 1/2 pesetas.  The judgment appealed,  thus modified, is affirmed, with the costs of this instance to the defendants. So ordered.</p>
<p> <em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Cooper, Willard,</em> and <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
