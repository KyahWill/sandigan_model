				<H3>DOMINGO ENRILE AS ADMINISTRATOR OF THE ESTATE OF MARIA DOLORES REYES DECEASED, PETITIONER, VS. THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF BULACAN (PRESIDED OVER BY THE JUDGES P. M. MOIR AND M. V. DEL ROSARIO) AND FELIPE BERNABE ET AL., RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a motion to dismiss the present action based upon the provisions of 
Act No. 2588.
<p>The action is one for a writ of mandamus directed to the Court of First 
Instance of Bulacan requiring it to dismiss an appeal taken from a judgment 
rendered by a justice of the peace in an action of forcible entry and detainer 
entitled Domingo Enrile, as administrator of the estate of Maria Dolores Reyes, 
deceased, vs. Felipe Bernabe and others.</p>
<p>The complaint alleges that Domingo Enrile, as administrator, began an action 
for unlawful entry and detainer in a justice's court of the Province of Bulacan; 
that judgment was obtained for the possession of the lands described in the 
complaint and for P16.33, the reasonable value of the use and occupation of said 
lands; that the defendants appealed to the Court of First Instance, all of them 
save one giving the bond required by law but none of them depositing in the 
justice's court the amount of the judgment obtained against them as required by 
section 88 of the Code of Civil Procedure; that on the arrival of the case in 
the Court of First Instance of Bulacan the appellee made a motion to dismiss the 
appeal on the ground that it had not been perfected in accordance with law, the 
appellants having failed to make the deposit in the justice's court required by 
the section of the Code of Civil Procedure referred to; that the Court of First 
Instance denied the motion, giving the appellants an opportunity to make such 
deposit in the Court of First Instance; that thereafter the appellee made a 
motion to reconsider the decision and, at the same time, offered another motion 
asking for a dismissal of the appeal on the ground that the appellants had not 
paid into the Court of First Instance the rent of the land involved in the suit 
as required by the section of the Code of Civil Procedure above mentioned ; that 
the Court of First Instance denied the motion for reconsideration and also the 
motion to dismiss the appeal, at the same time ordering the appellants to 
deposit in that court the rent of the land in question for the year 1915. The 
appeal of Ciriaca Jimenez was dismissed because she had not given the bond 
required by law.</p>
<p>During the pendency of this action the Philippine Legislature passed Act No. 
2588 which amends section 88 of the Code of Civil Procedure by providing that, 
instead of dismissing the appeal on failure of the appellant from a judgment in 
an action of forcible entry and detainer to make the deposit in the justice's 
court required by that section as a condition precedent to the allowance of his 
appeal, the court should, on motion and proof of the facts required by the 
section, order the execution of the judgment of the justice's court, but should 
continue with the appeal and decide the questions properly presented 
thereby.</p>
<p>The defendants in this action moved to dismiss it on the ground that Act No. 
2588 should be held to be applicable to the pending action and that the trial 
court was correct in its refusal to dismiss the appeal and that mandamus will 
not lie to compel it to act otherwise.</p>
<p>We are of the opinion that Act No. 2588 is applicable to the present case for 
the reason that it affects procedure rather than the substantive rights of the 
parties and tends to remedy a condition arising in appeals from judgments of 
justice's courts rendered in actions of forcible entry and detainer which, it is 
well known, has produced considerable hardship to appellants. Whether the motion 
to dismiss is the correct proceeding or not is immaterial as the action has been 
submitted to us on the merits and, in dealing with it thus, Act No. 2588 may be 
applied. </p>
<p>The action is dismissed, without costs. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Carson, Trent</em>, and <em>Araullo, JJ</em>., concur.</p></div>
