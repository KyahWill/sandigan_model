				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On August 12, 1909, counsel for the commercial firm of Gutierrez Hermanos, of 
the city of Manila, filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance of said 
city, seeking to recover from the firm of Oria Hermanos &amp; Co., the payment 
of the sum of P147,204.28 besides the interest thereon. from June 30, 1909, 
alleging among other things that, between the plaintiff and defendant companies, 
there existed some commercial relations which gave rise to the opening in their 
books of a mutual current account; that from this account to which the said 
defendant company had conformed, there remained a balance standing against the 
said defendant company, which1 balance amounts to the sum above-mentioned; that 
the plaintiff company had opportunely sent to the defendant company an abstract 
of the current account which shows the said balance for which the defendant 
company is liable to the plaintiff.
<p>In answer to the complaint, the defendant company denied the allegations 
therein contained, and alleged that the plaintiff company, as a commission 
agent, bound itself to buy and sell certain merchandise for the defendant, and 
that said plaintiff, in its accounts, entered fictitious or fraudulent prices of 
the goods, and for this reason the defendant company prayed that the plaintiff 
company be ordered to render an account of its transactions as such commission 
agent.</p>
<p>In view of the evidence adduced at the trial of the case by both parties the 
judge rendered on April 24, 1912, a judgment ordering the plaintiff company to 
render to the defendant company an account supported by vouchers of the amounts 
charged against the latter as regards the internal revenue taxes, the price and 
weight of the sacks of rice, and the value of the boxes of kerosene oil acquired 
by the plaintiff in the name and for the account of the defendant company, and 
condemning the defendant company to pay to the plaintiff the amount prayed for 
in the complaint after deducting therefrom whatever amount or amounts would 
result in favor of the defendant company from the accounts to be rendered by the 
plaintiff.</p>
<p>From this judgment both parties appealed. In March 30, 1915, this court 
rendered judgment whereby the plaintiff was ordered to render to the defendant 
an account supported by vouchers of the price and other expenses incurred in the 
shipment of rice as shown by the invoices examined during the trial of the case, 
as well as the 53 invoices mentioned by the parties at the hearing of November 
29, 1910, and also the price of all the kerosene oil acquired by the plaintiff 
for the defendant, the invoices of which appear to have been mentioned at the 
trial of December 28, 1910, and lastly, to account for the amounts paid as <span style="font-style: italic;">ad 
valorem</span> duties on the rice, salt, kerosene oil, and other goods the duties on 
which were charged against the defendant.</p>
<p>The case having been remanded to the lower court in compliance with the said 
decision of this court, the plaintiff company presented to the court a written 
statement of the accounts and upon hearing the defendant, the latter decreed the 
disapproval of the accounts so rendered, and notified the plaintiff to present 
to the court, within a short time, the vouchers supporting said accounts. By 
virtue of a written agreement entered into between the parties, the judge 
appointed D. M. Fleming as referee authorized to hear the parties respecting the 
rendition of accounts including the documents relative thereto, and to report to 
the court all the questions brought up by the parties during the proceedings 
before him. After Fleming had entered upon his duties in conformity with his 
appointment and had held several hearings in which the respective counsel of 
both parties were present, he filed in court on February 2, 1916, a report 
wherein he found that only 20 invoices of rice had been justified as correct; 
that 8 had been accepted as transferred to Legaspi according to their entries; 
that 56 had been proved and the amount of P2,479.56 had been acknowledged as due 
to the defendant; that one valued at P110.30 was erroneously accepted in favor 
of the plaintiff; that 76 invoices of rice have not been supported by vouchers; 
that of the invoices of kerosene oil only 5 had been supported by vouchers; and 
that, as regards other invoices comprising 592 cans, it was proved that in all 
of them, there were overcharges amounting to P78.63 as discounts not granted, 
and in one particular case, there was a recharge of the price. It was also found 
by him that there was no proof as regards the rest of the invoices which number 
73.</p>
<p>The defendant accepted this report, and asked the court to approve it, but 
the plaintiff opposed its approval. The court therefore ordered the referee to 
file an amended report, which should include facts that were not determined in 
the first report and for which evidence was presented, and from this order of 
the lower court the defendant excepted.</p>
<p>In compliance with this order of the court, on June 29, 1916, the referee 
submitted a second report to the court, which report contains the following 
summary:</p>

<p>In view of this second report of the referee, and of the allegations of both 
parties, the lower court approved said report and rendered a judgment on August 
16, 1916, adjudicating to the plaintiff the sum claimed in the complaint less 
the sum of P36,744.49, or the net balance of P110,459.79. From this judgment, 
the defendant alone appealed. The plaintiff having asked for the execution of 
the sentence which was acceded to by the judge, the latter ordered the return to 
the plaintiffs of the sum of fifty thousand pesos (P50,000) deposited as 
security for an order of attachment decreed in this case. The corresponding bill 
of exceptions having been presented by the defendant, the same was approved, 
certified, and forwarded to the clerk of 'this court.</p>
<p>With regard to the questions involved and to which the defendant-appellant 
has assigned errors in its brief, we believe jthat the first error assigned is 
untenable. It is a fact duly established that the referee took the oath of 
office before the judge of the Court of First Instance, as shown by the 
authentic certificate of said judge in his indorsement on the appointment of 
said referee, and for this reason, it can not be held that the proceedings had 
before the said referee were null and void.</p>
<p>As to the second error assigned regarding the execution of the sentence, we 
hold that Act No. 190, section 144, does not truly have for its object the 
annulment of an order of execution before the expiration of the period fixed for 
the perfecting of the bill of exceptions, unless for special reasons stated in 
the bill of exceptions the court shall order that execution be not stayed, 
because, if such reasons really existed, the failure to state them in the bill 
of exceptions does not vitiate the order of execution, for, according to the 
doctrine laid down in the case of Macke vs. Camps (5 Phil. Rep., 185), the 
Supreme Court will not interefere to modify, control, or inquire into the 
exercise of the discretion of the Court of First Instance to direct by special 
order that execution issue upon a final judgment before the period for preparing 
a bill of exceptions has expired, unless it appear that there has been an abuse 
or excess of authority on the part of the trial judge and, consequently, this 
error assigned can not be sustained, inasmuch as it is not shown that there has 
been an abuse or excess of authority.</p>
<p>Pending the proceedings in this court, by virtue of the appeal interposed by 
the defendant from the judgment rendered by the lower court, wherein an order of 
attachment, was issued, the attachment should be left undisturbed until the 
pending appeal is finally decided.</p>
<p>The principal issue involved in this case is: Upon which of the two reports 
presented by the referee is the judgment appealed from especially based?</p>
<p>The referee in his first report says that 76 invoices of rice and 73 invoices 
of kerosene oil were not supported by vouchers, and that the charges made by way 
of internal revenue taxes could not be estimated, unless all the invoices of 
rice were proved.</p>
<p>In his second report which is based upon the invoices wherein there was an 
error according to the evidence, together with the other data and information 
obtained personally by the said referee, the latter, estimating the average 
error which might have been committed in the invoices not satisfactorily proved, 
proceeded to fix at his own discretion the mistake proportionally to the figures 
as stated in the invoices. With regard to the internal revenue charges, he 
adjudged in favor of the defendant the sum shown in his statement of accounts 
(Exhibits A and B, p. 1677), having considered this statement more exact than 
that presented by the plaintiff.</p>
<p>Although the defendant company can not be held liable for the value of the 
invoices not duly proved by the plaintiff, nevertheless, if the records show 
that the defendant company had received the goods consigned to it under invoices 
and the only defect was that excessive prices were charged and certain amounts 
were unduly debited, it would not be just, that for said failure on the part of 
the plaintiff to prove all of the invoices, the defendant company would deny 
liability to pay for the goods received by it, after deducting from the price 
the excess and the quantities for which it was not liable. From this it follows 
that the first report of the referee can not be the proper basis for the the 
definite settlement of this case, and it is necessary to determine the amount 
for which the defendant would be liable to pay in view of the evidence 
adduced.</p>
<p>After examining the documents attached to the second report which served the 
basis for the referee's decision, we find that the referee has not proceeded in 
his estimates through whimsical and arbitrary methods, although he may have 
erred in estimating the interest, the commission, the charges unduly made in the 
invoices of kerosene oil, and in reducing the <span style="font-style: italic;">picos</span> of Saigon rice to correspond 
with the <span style="font-style: italic;">picos</span> of Manila, with the corresponding reduction for waste and 
leakage. With regard to the last item, the referee fixed the difference between 
the <span style="font-style: italic;">pico</span> of Saigon and that of Manila at 5 per cent of that of Saigon, including 
waste and leakage, in accordance with the book of weights and measures of 
international commerce by Macmillan &amp; Co., wherein it appears that a <span style="font-style: italic;">pico</span> in 
the Straits Settlements weighs 60.478 kilos, and the Saigon pico is considered 
equal to that of the Straits Settlements.</p>
<p>The witness Tomas Oria, a man versed in matters regarding exact and precise 
figures, stated (p. 224) before the referee that the <span style="font-style: italic;">pico</span> of Manila weighs 63.25 
kilos and that of Saigon, 63 kilos, so that the difference between the <span style="font-style: italic;">pico</span> of 
Saigon and that of Manila is only 3.15. Inasmuch as, according to the referee 
12 per cent is the reduction effected by reason of waste and leakage and 
estimated for each sack which weighs more than a <span style="font-style: italic;">pico</span>, as can be seen from its 
operations, it is evident that a reduction of 3.50 per cent as the difference in 
weight, and the waste and leakage should have been the more reasonable reduction 
as alleged by the defendant in its objections to the provisional report. 
(Record, p. 1653.)</p>
<p>There is also error in determining the amount earned as commission, which 
should have been charged to the defendant by the plaintiff, because the amounts 
upon which the estimate was made include the internal revenue taxes unduly 
charged, so that in the invoices attached to the records it appears that the 
plaintiff company never took its commission on said taxes, but took it on the 
value of the invoice, without including the internal revenue charges. This 
correction was made to fix definitely the amount to which the defendant is 
entitled.</p>
<p>With respect to the compound interest, the referee asserts that he made his 
estimates in a prudent manner, because the computation of all the amounts unduly 
charged would involve a great deal of work. The procedure followed by the 
referee is not permissible inasmuch as the record furnishes sufficient data 
whereby the compound interests, which resulted from the unlawful charges entered 
against the defendant, could have been adjusted in a correct and reasonable 
manner, for such interests can be determined in the same manner that the 
plaintiff determined and charged them against the defendant.</p>
<p>Exhibit B, page 146 of the first sheet, is a current account of Oria Hermanos 
&amp; Co. opened in the books of the plaintiff during the second semester of 
1908, and shows that to every amount charged to the defendant there is a 
corresponding amount in the column designated as "Numbers" and the same is true 
as regards the amounts under "Credit." It also appears that in the column under 
"Numbers," the amounts of the products of the quantities under "Debit" or 
"Credit" multiplied by the number of days during which such amounts should earn 
interest, these quantities under "Numbers" being lacking only of two whole 
figures and two decimals to the right. At the end of the account, the difference 
between the sums of the numbers under "Debit" and "Credit" is divided by 45.62 
1/2, the divisor of which is precisely the denominator of 8/836500 simplified by 
8; all of which shows that the interests were found by multiplying the amounts 
by the respective number of days during which such amounts should earn interests 
and by dividing the product by 100, disregarding the decimal figures but 
considering them as an entire unit, and adding it to the whole figures if. they 
exceeded the decimals of 50 hundredths, and dividing the difference of the sums 
of these quotations of "Debit" and "Credit" by 45.62£, and the capitalized 
quotient was put in the column of "Amounts" or "Capitals." With this operation, 
the exact and just amounts corresponding to the defendant were arrived at.</p>
<p>Regarding the invoices of kerosene oil, the referee found that the mistake in 
the invoices, Exhibits 157, 159, 164, 163, and 165, amounts to P78.63. For this 
reason he adjudged 15 centavos a box to cover the shortage in addition to the 
discounts which should be allowed to the defendants.</p>
<p>It is proven (Exhibits 157 and 166) that the plaintiff, in buying the 
kerosene oil, specified in the 5 invoices aforementioned sometimes obtained a 
discount of 2 1/2 per cent and at other time a discount of 1 per cent, and that the 
purchase price was less than that stated in the invoices. In the first decision 
rendered in this case, it was held that the plaintiff, as commission agent of 
the defendant, had no right to retain for itself the discounts obtained. For 
this reason, the conclusion arrived at by the referee that said plaintiff should 
reimburse to the defendant the discounts and the interest thereon unduly 
charged, is correct, although it is not just that the amount to be paid back is 
to be determined by the number of boxes of kerosene oil invoiced, inasmuch as 
said amount should be made up not only of the increase in prices but also of the 
discounts. The first, that is, the increase in prices, depends upon the number 
of boxes invoiced, and the second upon the total price of each invoice, 
estimating therefore the excess price in proportion to the number of boxes, and 
the discount not credited to the defendant, in proportion to the total prices of 
each invoice, and capitalize the interests of each semester.</p>
<p>Aside from the mistakes indicated above, we find that the conclusions arrived 
at by the referee in his last report, based on the grounds therein stated, are 
just and reasonable, inasmuch as they have not been impeached in substance by 
the appellant. In view of the facts above set forth and the contents of the 
Statement C of Exhibit A (record, pp. 100 and 1177), found to be correct by the 
referee and not contradicted by the firm of Gutierrez Hermanos, it follows that 
the latter firm should pay to Oria Hermanos &amp; Co., the sum of P37,063.57 
with the exception of what had been charged or refused allowance for the 8 
invoices of Legaspi, because there was no evidence that fraud has been committed 
in connection therewith.</p>
<p>Upon a comparison of the amount stated in the preceding paragraph and that 
fixed by the referee in his report, it will be seen that there is a very small 
difference between the two, and that is the sum of P319.08, which is due to the 
mistakes in the procedure mentioned in the preceding paragraphs and also due to 
the result of the computation of the compound interests to which the defendant 
was entitled, which result amounted to the sum due to the defendant.</p>
<p>Considering the facts above set forth and the evidence furnished by the 
record, we arrived at the conclusion that the defendant firm is only entitled to 
a reduction of the sum of P37,063.57 from the amount of P147,204.28 adjudged in 
favor of the plaintiff firm in the previous decision of this court under date of 
March 30, 1915,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and for this reason 
the defendant Oria Hermanos &amp; Co. is found liable to pay Gutierrez Hermanos 
the remaining balance of P110,140.71 and the interest thereon at the rate of 8 
per cent per annum from June 30, 1909, to the date of payment.</p>
<p>For the foregoing considerations, whereby the errors assigned to the judgment 
appealed from are deemed to have been refuted, we hold that, after deducting the 
sum of P37,063.57 from the amount specified in the previous decision of this 
court in this controversy, the defendant Oria Hermanos &amp; Co. should be, as 
it hereby is, condemned to pay to the plaintiff Gutierrez Hermanos the sum of Pl 
10,140.71 and the interest thereon at the rate of 8 per cent per annum from June 
30, 1909, and to pay the costs. So ordered.</p>
