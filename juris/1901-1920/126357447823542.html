				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The accused in this case was charged with the crime of robbery in that on the night of the 6th of May, 1904, in Concepcion, in the Province of Tarlac, he entered the house of one Feliciana  Puri,  breaking down the door, and after maltreating  the  said Feliciana Puri, and giving her  a number of blows with, his revolver, he  took  from her by force the sum of 6 pesos and 50 centimos.   He was convicted of the crime of robbery as defined and penalized in article 503, paragraph 5, of the Penal Code, and sentenced to three years eight  months and one day imprisonment, with the accessory penalties imposed  by  law, and to return to the said Feliciana  Puri  the  sum of 6 pesos and  50 centimos, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the costs of the trial.</p>
<p>It appears that on the night of the 6th of May, 1904, the accused  entered  the house of Feliciana  Puri during the absence of her  husband; that he struck  her several blows with his fist and with the butt end of the revolver which he carried,  knocking out a  tooth, and compelled her to give him 6 pesos and 50 centimos which she had concealed in her belt, after which  he  left the house,  firing a revolver shot through  the window.</p>
<p>The night was dark and there was no light  in the house and the only mode by which the witness was able to identify the accused was by the sound of his voice.  It Avas shown that she and the accused had known each other intimatelj since their youth, having lived in the same barrio for many years, so that there was nothing unreasonable in her assertion that she recognized the accused by his voice, although she could not see his face on account of the darkness.</p>
<p>It appears that on that very  night she made complaint to  the Constabulary charging the  accused with the commission of the crime; that the following morning he was arrested and,  that day being Saturday, was held in arrest until Monday, when he was brought before the justice of the peace, where he signed a written confession admitting his guilt.  At the trial  he withdrew  the confession and offered three  witnesses in defense  to prove an alibi, and stated that the alleged confession was made under threats and duress and under fear of  personal injury from  the Constabulary  who had him in  detention.  One of these witnesses, a relative of the accused,  stated that the accused arrived in the barrjo on the afternoon preceding the night of  the robbery, having come to attend the wedding of a mutual relative; that he was sick with fever and was  unable to attend the wedding and  that he was compelled to spend  the night at the house of the witness and was  not absent therefrom during  that night.   The accused, however, as well as the witness Jos6 Bermuda, declared that he had arrived in the barrio two days before the wedding, that he attended the wedding, and had been compelled to leave it on account of sickness, when he went to the house of  the first witness and spent the night  there.</p>
<p>We do not think the evidence  as  to the alibi can be  accepted in view of the material contradictions in the statements  of the witnesses, and we  are of opinion that, even though the confession made before the justice of the peace were excluded  from  the record,  the evidence of the complaining witness is sufficient under all the circumstances to establish the guilt of the accused.</p>
<p>The  court below failed to take into consideration any aggravating circumstances, although since the  crime was committed at  nighttime and advantage was taken of the darkness  for the  commission of the  offense,  the penalty should have been imposed in its maximum degree.  We therefore reverse the  sentence imposed by the trial court and instead thereof we sentence the said  Regino Manabat to six years ten months and one day's imprisonment (<em>presidio mayor</em>) with the accessory  penalties  prescribed by law, the indemnification of the said Feliciana Puri  in the sum of 6 pesos  and 50 centimos, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and the payment  of  the costs of both, instances.   After the expiration of ten days  let judgment be entered in accordance herewith and ten days thereafter the case remanded to the court  below for proper action.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Willard,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em>Johnson, J.,</em> did not sit in this case.<br>
