				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">MALVERSATION OF PUBLIC FUNDS.â€”From the Court of First Instance of Zambales. The accused failed to account for certain funds intrusted to his care as municipal treasurer and deputy provincial treasurer. He stated in defense that the money, part of which was silver, was burned in his residence which was destroyed by fire. Prompt search of the ruins failed to disclose the greater portion of the silver in any form. The part discovered was only slightly damaged by the heal. Witnesses testified to unusual and suspicious actions by accused. Evidence held to be sufficient to justify the finding of guilty. Judgment affirmed.<br><br><i>Per Mapa, J.</i><br><br>For appellant: Jose Syyap.<br>For appellee: Attorney-General Araneta.</div>
