				G.R. No. 12916, December 15, 1917</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. LAURO FONTANILLA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The defendant and appellant was charged in the Court of First Instance of 
Ilocos Sur with the crime of<em> lesiones menos graves</em> (less grave physical 
injuries) inflicted on the persons of Victoriano Gimenez and Antonio Montanes. 
He was found guilty and sentenced to six months of <em>arresto mayor</em> with 
the accessory penalties provided by law, and to pay the costs. On appeal, 
counsel <em>de officio</em> assigns seven errors of the trial court, all of 
which can be divided into questions concerning the sufficiency of the evidence 
and the penalty to be imposed. Counsel supports his assignments of error with an 
elaborate and carefully prepared brief. The Attorney-General answers with an 
equally well written brief, concluding with the recommendation that the judgment 
be affirmed.
<p>We have read the respective briefs and the decision of the trial court and 
have checked the evidence with the record. After a full consideration, but 
without taking the time to set forth the facts in detail, we cannot say that we 
are warranted in disturbing the findings of the trial court. More specifically, 
as the president of the municipal board of health testified, the wound of 
Victoriano Gimenez incapacitated him for labor for nine or ten days, and the 
wound of Antonio Montanes kept him from performing his regular work between five 
and seven days. Consequently, the facts as to Gimenez come under article 418, 
and as to Montanes under article 587, of the Penal Code.</p>
<p>This court recently held in a decision handed down by Justice Carson,^with 
Justice Street and the writer dissenting, that an accused can he convicted of 
more than one offense under one information. (U. S. <em>vs</em>. Balaba [1917], 
<em>ante</em>, p. 260. Following this rule, the accused must be found guilty of 
a violation of the two articles of the Penal Code above mentioned. As the record 
discloses that the accused is several times a recidivist, and as no mitigating 
circumstances are found, the court was justified in imposing the penalty in the 
maximum degree. The defendant and appellant is further sentenced to twenty-one 
days of arresto menor.</p>
<p>No evidence to prove damages for medical treatment, loss to the offended 
parties because of inability to perform their usual vocation, etc., was 
introduced at the trial. The lower court made no finding as to indemnification. 
Without such proof and finding, this court can of course not determine the 
amount of the indemnity.</p>
<p>With the addition above indicated, judgment is affirmed with the costs of 
this instance against the appellant. So ordered.</p><em>Arellano, C. J., 
Johnson, Carson, Araullo, Street</em>, and <em>Avancena, JJ</em>., concur. 
<br><br><br>

<p><strong>TORRES, J.,</strong> dissenting in part.</p>
<p>The undersigned concurs in the preceding decision in respect to the 
defendant's guilt and the personal penalties imposed upon him. He believes, 
however, that the inflicter of the less grave and the slight physical injuries 
{<em>lesiones menos graves y leves</em>) should be compelled to indemnify the 
aggrieved parties, respectively, for the losses occasioned them, though it be 
only for the wages they failed to earn in consequence of the punishable acts 
performed by the aggressor.</p>
<p>So long as the Penal Code, promulgated on March 13, 1887, is in force and 
effect in these Islands the provision of article 17 thereof, which prescribes 
that every person criminally liable for a felony or misdemeanor is also civilly 
liable, should be complied with.</p>
<p>With respect to indemnity, article 122, in connection with article 119, of 
the same code provides as follows:</p>
<p>"Indemnification for losses shall include not only those caused the injured 
party, but also those suffered by his family or by a third person by reason of 
the crime.</p>
<p>"The courts shall determine the amount of this indemnification in the manner 
prescribed for the reparation of damages in the next preceding article."</p>
<p>We agree that in fact the record discloses no proof of the amount of the 
expenses incurred by the offended parties for medicine and medical fees, but it 
does duly show, and is so stated in the majority decision, that Victoriano 
Gimenez was incapacitated for labor for nine or ten days, and Antonio Montanes, 
between five or seven days; and as they failed to earn their respective daily 
wages during those days, it is unquestionable that both they and their families 
suffered positive loss in their interests. Although the amount of the daily 
wages they failed to collect during the time they were under medical treatment 
was not, on their petition or at the request of the provincial fiscal, made of 
record, yet the failure so to do in this matter of detail cannot excuse 
compliance with said article 122 in so far as it prescribes that the courts 
shall determine the amount of the indemnification, and it is well known that the 
current rate of wages in the provinces is from 62 to 75 centavos a day, and in 
Manila, from 80 centavos to one peso.</p>
<p>So then, the number of days during which the injured parties were unable to 
work—a detail shown in the record—is undeniable proof of the losses suffered; 
and the court having the power to regulate, in accordance with prudent judgment, 
the amount of the loss suffered, by fixing it concordantly with the ordinary and 
current rate of wages in the provinces, it is not just that it should fail to 
comply with the law, to the detriment of the aggrieved parties.</p>
<p>For the reasons hereinabove stated, and supplying the omission made by the 
trial court in his judgment, the defendant should also be sentenced to pay an 
indemnity to Victoriano Gimenez in the sum of P7.20, and to Antonio Montanes in 
that of P4, and in case of insolvency in the payment of the first sum he should 
suffer the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment, and in the payment of the 
second sum, also subsidiary imprisonment calculated on the basis of 15 pesetas a 
day.</p></div>
