				G.R. No. 1288, September 17, 1903</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES,  COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE, VS. LEON LIZARDO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.

				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The Court of  First Instance  of  Abra convicted Leon Lizardo, municipal treasurer of the town of San Jose, upon the charge of malversation of public funds, and condemned him to six months of <em>arresto mayor</em> and the payment of costs.   The article of the Penal Code applied is not cited, but from the nature of the  penalty  imposed it can be no other than article 390, paragraph 1.</p>
<p>The Solicitor-General, considering that the evidence does not show that  the malversation of the funds in  question has caused any damage or prejudice to the public service, asks that the judgment be reversed and that the appellant, Leon Lizardo,  be condemned to  two years of suspension from office and the payment of a fine of 10 per cent of the funds  misapplied, with the accessories and  the  costs of this  instance.   Doubtless the article which  the Solicitor- General  has in mind  is No. 392, paragraph 3â€”that is to say,  he considers that the crime herein prosecuted  is one merely consisting of the  temporary diversion and not the unqualified embezzlement of public funds.  But in order that the crime be regarded as a mere temporary diversion, it is absolutely necessary that the funds should be restored, otherwise the money misapplied must be regarded as having been embezzled, and the crime then falls within the provisions of article 390.   If the money has been returned, on the other hand, then the crime can only be regarded as a temporary misuse of public funds, but not as an embezzlement of the money.  It is only when the money has been restored that it becomes  necessary to determine whether, up to the time of the restoration, any damage or detriment. was or was not caused the public service by the application of the public funds to improper uses, as a preliminary to determining under which paragraph of article 392 the case falls.</p>
<p>The proper article to be applied, therefore, is No. 390, but as the principal penalty prescribed by paragraph 1 of the article is <em> arresto  mayor</em> in  its maximum grade  to <em>presidio correccional</em> in its minimum grade, together with special  temporary disqualification in its maximum  grade, to perpetual absolute disqualification as an accessory penalty established by  the second  paragraph of  the same article, it follows that the decision of the  court below is incorrect with respect to the application of the penalty, as in this case, there being no aggravating or  mitigating circumstances to consider,  the penalty should be imposed in its medium grade.</p>
<p>For these reasons  we  condemn  the  defendant,  Leon Lizardo, to  one year and one day of <em>presidio correccional</em>, and furthermore to eleven years  and one  day of  special temporary disqualification,  and to the payment of the costs of both  instances, thus  affirming the decision appealed.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Cooper, Mapa,</em> and <em>McDonough, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
