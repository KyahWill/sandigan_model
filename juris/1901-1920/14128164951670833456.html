				<BR><STRONG>MORELAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Manila in favor of the plaintiffs requiring: <br><br>"Wherefore,&nbsp; it&nbsp; is hereby ordered and adjudged that the plaintiff have and recover judgment against the defendant for the sum of PI, 106.45, with interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum&nbsp; from the 21st day of October,&nbsp; 1914, the date of the filing&nbsp; of the complaint in this&nbsp; case, and for the further sum of P350, with interest at the same rate, from the 5th day of November, 1914.<br><blockquote>"It is further ordered and adjudged that the defendant pay to&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; the sum of P50 for each and every month during the period beginning November 1,&nbsp; 1914,&nbsp; and ending&nbsp; June 30,&nbsp; 1917,&nbsp; both dates&nbsp; inclusive, the monthly payment to&nbsp; be&nbsp; made on or before the 5th day of the next succeeding month, and&nbsp; to&nbsp; draw interest&nbsp; at the&nbsp; rate of 6 per cent per annum from that date until paid.&nbsp; Upon the occurrence of&nbsp; any fortuitous event which under existing laws would have&nbsp; extinguished the obligation on the part&nbsp; of the defendant to pay&nbsp; rent under the lease here in question this judgment shall be regarded as satisfied as to the payment not yet due&nbsp; at the time of the occurrence of the event."<br></blockquote>The case comes to this court on a stipulation of facts in which it appears that, on the 1st day of July, 1913, plaintiff and defendant entered into a contract whereby the plaintiff leased to the defendant the premises described therein for a period of four&nbsp; years from the date of said lease for a monthly rent of P350 payable by the lessee "within the first five days of each following month."&nbsp; The lessee entered into possession of the&nbsp; premises and occupied the same until the 8th day of August, 1914, when he served on the lessor notice in the form&nbsp; of a letter addressed to him that he had elected to terminate the&nbsp; lease and that the premises were&nbsp; at the disposal&nbsp; of the lessor thenceforth.&nbsp;&nbsp; The lessee turned the premises over to the lessor's caretaker notwithstanding the fact "that plaintiff did not&nbsp; wish&nbsp; the&nbsp; surrender of&nbsp; the premises&nbsp; and desired&nbsp; that defendant should&nbsp; continue&nbsp; to occupy them&nbsp; under the lease."&nbsp; The letter of the&nbsp; lessee to the lessor is as follows:<br><blockquote>&nbsp; "Gentlemen: By the terms of agreement entered into between us on July 19, 1913, for lease of building No. 53-55 Plaza McKinley, district of Intramuros, Manila,&nbsp; the&nbsp; same has, under the provisions&nbsp; of the first and tenth sections thereof, automatically lapsed.<br><br>"You are hereby notified that I am now prepared to pay the rental of said&nbsp; building for the month of July,&nbsp; 1914, and for that part of the month of August during which the above-named lease&nbsp; was in&nbsp; force&nbsp; and effect, viz.,&nbsp; from&nbsp; the first to fifth day inclusive."</blockquote>On the&nbsp; 25th of August, 1914,&nbsp; the attorney for the lessor called the&nbsp; attention of the lessee to what he termed&nbsp; the latter's breach of the provisions of the lease asking him to reconsider his&nbsp; determination&nbsp; to&nbsp; vacate&nbsp; the premises and warning him that, in case he continued in his present attitude, the&nbsp; plaintiff would attempt to rent the&nbsp; premises&nbsp; to some other tenant and&nbsp; would hold the lessee responsible for all&nbsp; resulting&nbsp; damage.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the 27th of&nbsp; August the lessee replied to this letter stating:<br><blockquote>"Your favor of the 25th&nbsp; inst., with reference to the contract of lease between the&nbsp; Sres.&nbsp; Fernandez Hermanos and me, is received.<br><br>"I regret my inability to agree with the construction&nbsp; of the contract&nbsp; as expressed&nbsp; by you, and am constrained&nbsp; to maintain that under its terms as specifically stated, the contract lapsed on August 5, 1914."<br></blockquote>The stipulation of facts states:<br><blockquote>"That since the defendant left the premises in&nbsp; question to the disposition&nbsp; of the plaintiffs, they tried&nbsp; to lease the same under the most advantageous conditions possible, and advertised them for rent by notice posted on the premises and by publication in the daily newspapers, the <i>Daily Bulletin</i> and <i>El Comercio</i> from the month of August to the month of October,&nbsp; 1914, and paid for the publication of notice the sum of thirty-seven pesos and&nbsp; ninety centavos (P37.90).<br><br>"That notwithstanding the efforts made&nbsp; by the plaintiff to lease the premises&nbsp; under the most advantageous conditions possible, they only succeeded in leasing them to Don Mariano Lim on the 10th day of October, 1914, the contract . of lease to take effect on the 1st day of November of the same year and copy of the contract of lease&nbsp; is attached hereto marked Exhibit E and made a part hereof, and is the best lease which the plaintiff succeeded in making." </blockquote>The stipulation&nbsp; further says:<br><blockquote>"That the defendant has not paid&nbsp; the&nbsp; rent beginning with the month of July, 1914, nor the cost of water used upon the premises during the third quarter of the year 1914, which amounts to the sum&nbsp; of eighteen pesos and fifty-five centavos (P18.55).<br><br>"That the&nbsp; premises were unoccupied from the time that the defendant gave notice of termination of lease&nbsp; on&nbsp; the 8th day of August&nbsp; until the 1st day of November, 1914, at&nbsp; which&nbsp; time&nbsp; they were occupied by&nbsp; the&nbsp; present tenant, Don Mariano Lim, and that the plaintiff has received no rent for the premises during that period.<br><br>"Parties further agree that the court may&nbsp; enter judgment upon the foregoing statement of facts without further trial of the issue raised by the pleadings, the parties reserving only the privilege of presenting briefsâ€”the plaintiff, fifteen (15) days from date hereof&nbsp; and the defendant, fifteen (15) days after the receipt of plaintiff's brief."<br></blockquote>The appellant bases his whole contention on paragraph 10 of the lease which reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"Tenth. Failure on the part of the lessee&nbsp; to comply with all or any of the terms of this lease, and more particularly of that set forth in paragraph first of this&nbsp; agreement will cause the rescission of this&nbsp; lease on the part of the lessor and lessee being thereby obliged to immediately vacate the premises."<br></blockquote>Placing himself upon this paragraph appellant maintains that his failure to&nbsp; pay rent for the&nbsp; month of July, 1914, automatically produced under paragraph 10 the rescission of the contract, and released him from the&nbsp; obligation thereby imposed; and that he was accordingly at liberty to leave the premises any moment thereafter.&nbsp; We cannot agree with this interpretation of paragraph 10; but are constrained to accept the construction placed thereon by the trial court. Appellant has overlooked not only certain important words in the&nbsp; paragraph referred to but also&nbsp; the general principles of law which, in the absence of express stipulation to the contrary, prohibit a party from taking advantage of his own wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp; Appellant seems to have forgotten that&nbsp; the very first&nbsp; paragraph of the lease imposes upon him&nbsp; the obligation to occupy the premises and pay rent for a period of four years from the date of the lease.&nbsp; This obligation cannot be avoided without the consent of the lessor.&nbsp; In the absence of a stipulation by the terms of which the lessee could terminate the lease, the provision fixing the duration of the lease at four years&nbsp; is binding on the lessee and he cannot&nbsp; legally&nbsp; escape therefrom.&nbsp;&nbsp; Paragraph&nbsp; 10 is not a provision by which&nbsp; the lessee may terminate the lease; it is rather&nbsp; a provision&nbsp; whereby&nbsp; the lessor may&nbsp; rescind&nbsp; the contract and collect from the lessee damages resulting from the acts of the lessee which gave the lessor the right to rescind. The paragraph itself provides&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; only rescission&nbsp; which can take place will&nbsp; be one which proceeds from&nbsp; the lessor himself and to that end&nbsp; it disposes&nbsp; that the lease shall continue in&nbsp; full force and effect&nbsp; until&nbsp; the performance of some act on the part of the lessee which "will cause the rescission of this lease <i>on the part of&nbsp; the lessor</i>."&nbsp; The&nbsp; lease containing no provision&nbsp; by which&nbsp; the lessee&nbsp; may release himself from&nbsp; the obligation imposed thereby, any act performed by the lessee which is in violation of its terms is a wrong against the lessor.&nbsp; Being a wrong the wrongdoer can take no advantage therefrom.&nbsp;&nbsp; If a person could rescind&nbsp; an&nbsp; obligation by the simple act of refusing to&nbsp; fulfill&nbsp; it&nbsp; then&nbsp; contracts&nbsp; would be worthless things; and&nbsp; if one&nbsp; may take advantage of his own wrong then there is no inducement to do right.<br><br>There being no objection&nbsp; by either party to&nbsp; the form of the&nbsp; judgment it is&nbsp; hereby affirmed,&nbsp; with costs against the appellant.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Torres, Trent,</i> and <i>Araullo, JJ., </i>concur.<br><br><i>Johnson, J.</i>, dissents.</div>
