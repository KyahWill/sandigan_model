				<H3>JULIANA BONCAN, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS.  SMITH, BELL & CO., AND J. J. PETERSON, SHERIFF OF THE CITY OF MANILA, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>From the record it appears that some time prior to the commencement of this action (the 16th of March, 1906) the defendants herein, Smith, Bell  &amp; Co.,  in a cause,  No. 4301, pending in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, obtained a judgment against Emiliano Boncan, and that on or about the 1st day of March, 1906, the said defendants Smith, Bell &amp;  Co. had  an order of execution issued against the  defendant in  that  cause,  Emiliano Boncan,  and had the said  execution  levied upon the real property described in the  complaint  in this cause.</p>
<p>On the Kith day  of March, 1906, the plaintiff  herein commenced an action in the  Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, praying that she be declared to be the owner of the said  land in question, with right to the possession of the same, and that the said attachment levied by virtue of  the judgment which the defendants, Smith, Bell &amp; Co., had obtained against the said Emiliano Boncan be dissolved and that the defendants be charged Avith the costs of the action.</p>
<p>The defendants, Smith,  Bell &amp; Co., by  means of their attorneys, filed a general denial in said cause. After hearing the evidence adduced during the trial of said cause, the judge of the lower court denied the petition of  the plaintiff  and  refused  to dissolve the said attachment, and dismissed the said cause with costs  against  the plaintiff. From this decision the plaintiff appealed to this court. An examination of the evidence  brought to this court shows the following facts:</p>
<ol>
  <li> That Francisca Yap de Boncan  died on the 22d day of July, 1905, in the city of Manila, leaving certain property to her heirs.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> That the plaintiff, Juliana  Boncan, was one of  the heirs and entitled  to  a distributive  share of  the estate of Francisca Yap de  Boncan.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> That Emiliano  Boncan was one of the heirs of  the said Francisca and entitled to a  distributive share of  the said state. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> That Emiliano  Boncan, by  virtue of being an heir and entitled to a distributive share of the estate of the said  Francisca, owned a one-sixth part of the property described in the said complaint.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> That on the 20th day of August, 1905, the said Emiliano Boncan,  by means of  a  public document, sold  and transferred all his  right, title, and interest in the said land  to the plaintiff herein,  Juliana Boncan, for the sum of P2,500.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> That the defendants in this cause neither alleged nor attempted to prove that the sale of the land in question by Emiliano Boncan to the said Juliana Boncan was  not a valid sale and a transfer of all the right, title, and interest which the said Emiliano Boncan had in said land.</li>
</ol>
<p>The deed of transfer  by the said Emiliano Boncan to the said Juliana Boncan  appears to be regular in form and in compliance  with the  forms  prescribed by law.  (See sec. 127, Act No. 496.)</p>
<p>The defendants during the trial of the cause in the lower court objected to the introduction  of said  deed as evidence for the purpose of showing that the title which Emiliano Boncan had in said  land had been transferred to Juliana Boncan, for the reason:</p>
<ol>
  <li> That the  said  deed had not  been  registered in  accordance with the provisions of the Commercial Code; and<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> That the same  had  not  been  signed  by both parties, in accordance with the provisions of the Spanish law.</li>
</ol>
<p>This court has recently decided in the case of Fabian et al. vs.  Smith, Bell&amp;  Co.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> (5 Off. Gaz., 576) that an unregistered deed is admissible in evidence to show a transfer of title as against an attaching creditor, holding that the attaching creditor was not "third persons" mentioned in  article 389 of  the Mortgage Law, and that  the levy of an execution against a judgment debtor  upon real estate which stands  in his name does not take precedence over an unrecorded deed  to the same property made by  the judgment debtor prior to the levy in question.  The deed to the land  in question,  therefore,  was admissible in evidence for the purpose of showing that  the  title  which Emiliano Boncan had in the  said land had been  transferred to the said Juliana Boncan, and until this deed is set  aside by competent authority  the same will  stand, showing  that the interest  thereby conveyed  belongs  to Juliana Boncan.</p>
<p>With reference  to the second objection above noted,  to wit, that the deed had not been signed by both grantor and grantee,  we are of the opinion, and so hold, that in this respect the deed  in question complied with  section 127 of Act No.  496.</p>
<p>The evidence presented during the trial of the cause on the  part  of the plaintiff  shows clearly that the land  in question  had  been transferred by Emiliano  Boncan  to Juliana Boncan several months prior to the attachment levied upon said property in  favor of the defendants.   This being true, the said attachment was levied upon the property  of Juliana Boncan  and  not  upon the property  of Emiliano Boncan, and therefore was  illegally  levied and the same is hereby dissolved.</p>
<p>The judgment of the  lower court  is therefore hereby reversed.    So ordered.</p>
