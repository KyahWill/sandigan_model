				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is  an action  to  recover damages suffered by the plaintiff by reason of injuries sustained  by the steamship <em>Kaifong</em> while passing through Iloilo Strait under the control and guidance  of the defendant Cipriano Vidal, as pilot. The court after trial gave judgment against the defendants for P11,316.13, P3,000 property of the Iloilo Pilots' Association to be applied to the payment  thereof, the  balance  to be paid by the defendant Vidal.</p>
<p>The damages herein mentioned were caused to  the steamship <em>Kaifong</em> by  striking a rock in Iloilo Strait near the "Siete Pecados," a group of coral islands, by reason of which a  portion of the hull was broken in and other  injuries caused.  At the time the defendant Vidal was a member of the Iloilo Pilots' Association and as such had been named by that  association  to pilot the  <em>Kaifong</em> through the Iloilo Strait on the day in question.  The plaintiff had no hand in his selection.</p>
<p>Iloilo  Strait is  a narrow  strip of water lying between Panay and  Guimaras.  It runs northeast and southwest. The main, or northern, channel is about one-third of a mile wide,  with plenty of water in its  center  for  the  largest ships.</p>
<p>From the proofs it appears that, on the day of  the accident, the captain of the ship turned  the  management of the same over to the pilot when she was between one and two miles  east, or, more properly speaking, northeast, of the "Siete Pecados."  At that time the boat was upon the course  usually and ordinarily taken  by  vessels  passing through that strait.  It was  headed directly toward  the lighthouse on one of the "Siete Pecados."  The usual and ordinary course for a vessel passing through the strait is to take what is known as the north channel. In doing this the course, for a  considerable distance after entering the strait, is directly  toward the  light-house.  Arriving at  a point about half a  mile from the light-house, the course is changed to  the northward, from there on describing  a moderate curve which turns again to the southward after passing the "Siete Pecados."</p>
<p>It is the undisputed evidence that this  is  the uniform course for  vessels passing through said  channel.  It is also the undisputed evidence  in  this case that the defendant Vidal did not take this course.  Instead he passed  out of the ordinary course and outside the deeper part of the channel and approached closely the "Siete Pecados," something very  unusual,  if  not  extraordinary, in  vessels passing through  the channel.  So unusual was this  course that the captain spoke to the defendant about it,  saying that he was getting in  too  close to the reefs.  The pilot replied that there was plenty of water there and that there was nothing to fear.  It was less than five minutes after this conversation that the vessel struck.</p>
<p>The obstruction with which the vessel collided  was a pinnacle rock rising alone out of deep water, its summit being at the time about 13 to 14 feet below the surface. This rock, it is conceded, was not charted and did not appear on any hydrographic map of the locality, official or otherwise.  The captain of the ship did not know of the existence of such a rock and the pilot asserts that he did not know of it.  There is uncontradicted evidence, however, of the fact that said rock was known to pilots and local navigators in and about Iloilo as early as 1900 or 1901, a quartermaster's boat having been lost upon that same rock in about  the year 1900.   The name usually given to it was the "Eighth Sin."  It is the undisputed testimony of Captain Hamilton that the existence of that rock was known some years before to the president of the Pilots' Association of Iloilo.</p>
<p>We believe  upon the whole that the case was  properly decided by the court below.  It is a fundamental rule of navigators; especially when traveling through straits, and channels, never  to go outside  of  the usual  and  ordinary course traveled by vessels except for some pressing and substantial reason.   The usual and ordinary course is the safe course.   Any change from that course is more or Jess of an experiment.  This is particularly true in narrow and  uncertain waters.  A ship is not something with which to try experiments.  Too many lives and too much, property are at stake. The usual course of navigators should always be adhered  to under such circumstances as this case  presents unless deviation therefrom is based upon some substantial reason.   Whim or caprice is not enough.  Neither is the desire to experiment or explore.  The pilot in the case at bar having deviated from the usual and ordinary course followed by navigators in  passing through  the strait in question, .without a substantial reason, was guilty of negligence, and that negligence  having been the proximate cause of  the damages, he is liable for such damages as usually  and naturally flow therefrom.   This conclusion is based upon the expert  testimony of the  case presented  by experienced navigators.</p>
<p>There is evidence upon  which we mignt make,a finding of negligence upon the  ground that the defendant should have known of the existence and location of the rock upon which the vessel struck while under his control and management.  We do not, however, find it necessary to do so inasmuch as we may legally and justly base our decision, upon the  proposition that  a navigator passing  through straits and  channels is not permitted to pass  out of the usual and ordinary course followed by navigators without some compelling reason for such change.</p>
<p>All of the other questions in the case are uncontested. The  amount of damages is substantially conceded; the responsibility of  the other defendants  is unquestioned; and the ownership of the vessel by the plaintiffs is conceded of record.   The only question before us is  that of the negligence of the defendant Vidal.</p>
<p>The judgment is hereby  affirmed, without special finding as to costs.</p>
