				G.R. No. 7203, March 22, 1912</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. CHUA PUETE AND QUE UNG BO,  DEFENDANTS.  QUE UNG BO, APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>These defendants  were charged with a violation of tne Opium Law, in that they did on the 11th of April, 1911, have in their possession a certain amount of opium and were smoking  the same.</p>
<p>During the trial the lower court found that the evidence was insufficient to support the charge against Chua Puete and dismissed  the complaint against him and discharged him from the custody of the law, with one-half the costs <em> de oficio</em>.</p>
<p>The lower court found  that the evidence was sufficient to support the  charge against the defendant Que Ung Bo, and sentenced  him to  be  imprisoned for a period of five months and  to pay one-half the costs.</p>
<p>From that sentence the defendant, Que Ung Bo, appealed.</p>
<p>It appears from the record that some time after the defendant had  been arrested and before the termination of the criminal proceedings, the defendant, Que Ung Bo,  entered into negotiations with an agent  of the Internal Revenue Department, for the  purpose of effecting a compromise, in accordance with the provisions of section  25 of  Act No. 1761 of the Philippine Commission.  Said section  provides:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The Collector of  Internal Revenue, with the approval of the Secretary of Finance and Justice, may compromise any civil or other case arising from the provisions of this Act instead of commencing or prosecuting suit thereon, and, with the consent of the Secretary of Finance and Justice, he may compromise such  case after action has been begun thereon."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It also appears from the record that during the  course of the negotiations for said compromise, the defendant paid to a representative of the Internal Revenue Department the sum of P700.  It also appears from the record that the attempted compromise was never fully completed.   The record shows that the Collector of Internal Revenue refused to conclude the attempted compromise.  There is nothing in the record which shows that the question had ever been presented to the  Secretary of Finance and Justice.  The compromise under said quoted section can not be completed without the approval oÂ£ the said Secretary, and until the compromise is completed, with the approval  of the Secretary, no negotiations for a  compromise can  affect the criminal prosecution instituted.  Had the compromise been completed, with the approval of the Secretary of Finance and Justice, it would then have had the effect  of terminating the criminal action.   Mere negotiations for a compromise can not affect the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance over the criminal action.  The compromise, however, may be perfected "after the action has been begun." The attempted compromise not having been carried to a termination,  in accordance with the provisions of said section (25), did  in no way affect the criminal prosecution begun in the Court of First Instance.</p>
<p>Upon a  careful examination of the record brought to this court, arid taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances connected with the commission of the crime, we are of the opinion that the defendant should  be  punished with a fine only.</p>
<p>The sentence of the  lower court is, therefore, hereby modified, and it is hereby ordered that the  defendant, Que Ung Bo, be sentenced to pay a fine of P500, in case of insolvency to suffer subsidiary imprisonment, and to pay one-half the costs in the lower court and the costs in this court.</p>
<p>The record does not disclose whether or not the said sum of P700 has been returned  to the defendant.  If not, the same  should be returned after the satisfaction of the sentence herein imposed.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C J., Torres </em>and <em>Carson, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em> Moreland and Trent, JJ.,</em> concur as to the dispositive part.<br>
