				<H3>ANTONIO  VENTURA, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. PAUL A. MILLER, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.

				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> On September 1, 1899, Dona Eumelia Eleizegui, widow of Revilla, leased the house in question to Dona Joseftna Reynoso, wife of Paul A. Miller, for two  years from  said date at the rent of 26. pesos a month,  payable during the first six days of each month.  No mention  was made in the lease of any future sale of the property.   It was never inscribed in the registry of property.  On December 6, 1900, Dona Eumelia sold the property to the plaintiff.   No mention of the lease was made in the deed and the grantor stated therein that the property was free  from all incumbrance.  On  December 14, 1900, the plaintiff notified the tenant that he must vacate the house at the end  of the month or pay 80 pesos a month thereafter.  The tenant refused to either pay this increased rent or to vacate the premises and prior to January 11, 1901, deposited with a notary the rent for December and January at the rate of 26 pesos a month.  The  plaintiff took from the notary the rent for December under the protest contained in the receipt which she then gave, but refused to take the  rent for January.  On March 11, 1901,  she  commenced  this action for unlawful detainer against Miller and his wife. It was defended by Dona Eumelia, the lessor.</p>
<p> She claimed that there was a verbal  agreement between her and the plaintiff  at the time of the sale  to the effect that the lease should be respected.  The  evidence in the case does not show this.<br>
  <br>
  She also claimed that  by accepting  the December rent the plaintiff recognized the validity of the  lease.   The  sale was made on  December 6.   The matter of the rent for  this month was the subject of a verbal contract  between the seller and purchaser, and the seller agreed that  the purchaser might collect it. Under all the circumstances in the case the acceptance of this rent by the plaintiff in January after the notices given by her in December did  not bind her to respect the lease.   She had the right to terminate it (art. 1571, Civil Code), and  the judgment should have been in her favor.</p>
<p> The judgment of  the court below is  reversed and judgment  is ordered for  the  plaintiff directing  the  eviction asked by the  plaintiff, with costs  of the first  instance against the defendants  and without  especial  order as to the costs  of this instance.</p>
<p> <em>Arellano, C. J., Cooper, Mapa,</em> and <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p> <em>Torres, J.,</em> did not sit in this case.</p>
