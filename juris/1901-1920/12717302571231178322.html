				<H3>CHARLES G. EADES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. THE ATLANTIC, GULF AND PACIFIC COMPANY, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.

				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This was an action to&nbsp; recover&nbsp; the sum of P17,965.01 for personal injuries received by the plaintiff,&nbsp; growing out of an alleged violation of a duty imposed upon the defendant,<br><br>The lower court, after a very careful consideration of the pleadings and the evidence,&nbsp; decided that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover against the defendant, and rendered a judgment accordingly, with costs&nbsp; against the plaintiff. From that judgment the plaintiff appealed.<br><br>After a careful consideration of the facts alleged in the complaint and in the answer and the&nbsp; proof adduced during the trial of&nbsp; the cause, and without prejudice to the writing of a more extended opinion in which&nbsp; shall be discussed the facts and the law, we desire at the present time to announce the following conclusions:<br><br>First. That the present action is an action <i>ex delicto</i> and not an action <i>ex&nbsp; contractu</i>, and that the defendant is&nbsp; liable to the plaintiff in damages, if the proof shows that the latter has been injured by reason of the negligence of the former.<br><br>Second. That the record shows by a great preponderance of evidence&nbsp; that the plaintiff was severely and permanently injured.<br><br>Third.&nbsp; That the record shows by&nbsp; a&nbsp; preponderance&nbsp; of evidence that the severe and permanent injuries of&nbsp; the plaintiff were directly due to the negligence of the defendant, as alleged in the petition of the plaintiff.<br><br>Fourth. That without announcing a general rule for the measure of&nbsp; damages for personal injuries in cases like the present, and adhering to the rule of comparative negligence, heretofore announced in the case of Rakes <i>vs.</i> Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific&nbsp; Company (7 Phil. Rep.,&nbsp; 359), we&nbsp; are of the opinion, and so decide, that the reasonable amount of&nbsp; damages to which the plaintiff is entitled for his injuries, caused by the negligence of&nbsp; the defendant, is the sum of P5,000. Therefore the judgment of the lower&nbsp; court is reversed and it is hereby ordered and&nbsp; decreed that a judgment be entered in favor of the plaintiff&nbsp; against the defendant in the sum of P5,000,&nbsp; with interest at&nbsp; the rate of 6 per cent from the 6th day of April, 1908, with costs.<br><br><i>Torres, Mapa, Johnson</i>, and <i>Carson, JJ</i>., concur.<br><br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="center"><br><center><br><i>DISSENTING:</i><br></center><br><br><b>MORELAND, <i>J,</i> </b><br><br>I dissent.&nbsp; The judgment of the court below is fully sustained by the&nbsp; evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no substantial, I had almost said no ground whatever, for its reversal.&nbsp; The negligence of the defendant is, in my humble judgment, entirely unproved.&nbsp;&nbsp; The holding of the court that the action is one <i> ex delicto</i> and not <i>ex contractu</i> is decisive against reversal, as it is substantially conceded by this court, as I understand it, that the liability in this case, if any, springs from&nbsp; a failure on the part of the defendant, to fulfill the terms of a contract with the&nbsp; city of Manila to keep the streets in repair for a stated period and not from a failure to observe a duty which defendant&nbsp; owed to the public.<br></div>
