				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The defendant was  charged with the crime of robbery in the  following complaint:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"That on or about January 2 [4], 1910, in the municipalty of Cebu, of this province and judicial district, the said accused did intentionally and feloniously, and for the sake of gain, by means of violence and intimidation employed against the person of  the Chinaman, Lim Chungque, of the municipality of Cebu,  take possession of the sum of P1,000, the property of the said Chinaman; contrary to law."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After hearing the evidence adduced during the trial, the Honorable Adolph Wislizenus, judge, found the defendant guilty of the crime charged in the complaint, and sentenced him to be imprisoned for a period of six years and one day of <i>presidio mayor</i>, to indemnify Lim Chungque in the sum  of Pl,000, with the accessories of the law, and to pay the costs.</p>
<p>From that sentence of the lower  court the defendant appealed.</p>
<p>The lower court made the following findings of fact:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"On the afternoon of January 3, 1910, in the municipality of Cebu, of this province and judicial district, said Chinaman was visited in his store, situated in the said municipality of Cebu, by a Filipino, an  agent sent by the defendant, who exhibited to the said Chinaman a letter that appeared to be signed by another Chinaman, named  Diaoco, residing in the neighboring municipality of Toledo and known to the said Lim  Chungque.   In this letter  it appeared that  Diaoco requested Lim Chungque to sell him three cans of opium, said letter being accompanied by the sum of P120 as the price of the opium.  Not having the opium  at his disposal just then, the Chinaman Lim Chungque told the agent to come back early the next day to get it, and said agent did in fact visit  the store of Lim Chungque about 5 a. m. and the latter delivered to him three  cans of opium which he had secured from another source, and he received  from the agent the said sum of P120, the price of the opium.  The agent then went away with the three cans of opium, but two hours later returned  carrying  the  same three cans and  accompanied by the defendant, who immediately told Lim Chungque that he was an inspector to search for contraband goods and  denounced the said  Chinaman for  having  unlawfully sold the three cans of opium, telling  him that the crime is punished with many years of imprisonment, besides a fine, and  threatening him with arrest and  indictment for the crime he had committed.  The Chinaman Lim Chungque at once  asserted his innocence and invited the defendant to make a search of his store, but the latter merely said that the Chinaman had  unlawfully sold the opium and that it was his intention to take  the said Lim Chungque before the authorities under arrest and charge him with a violation of the Opium Law, but told him if he wished to get.out of 'this fix' he had to pay the defendant the  sum of P2,000. The Chinaman Lim Chungque replied that he did not  have that sum, and, after some talk, the defendant agreed not to take him before the  authorities  and  not to charge him with a                      violation of the Opium Law, provided that he give up the sum of Pl,000, and because of this intimidation,  through fear of arrest and trial as a violator of the Opium Law, the Chinaman  Lim Chungque delivered to the  defendant the sum of P1,000, which the defendant accepted.  He  then went away without arresting Lim Chungque or afterwards denouncing him for an alleged violation of the law."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After  a careful examination of the  evidence  adduced during the trial of the cause, we find that the findings of fact made by the lower court are a true and correct resume of such evidence and that the same  shows that the defendant is guilty of the crime of robbery  beyond peradventure of doubt.   (U. S. <em>vs.</em>  Flores,  19 Phil. Rep., 178;  decision of the supreme court of Spain of the 24th of June, 1875; U. S. <em>vs.</em> Smith, 3 Phil. Rep., 20; 3 Viada, 341.)</p>
<p>One who obtains money by pretending to be an officer of the law and by threats of arrest and imprisonment is guilty  of the crime of robbery by intimidation.  (Art. 502, Penal Code.)</p>
<p>The crime in the present case was  committed in the house of the offended party; there existed, therefore, the aggravating circumstance of <em>morada.</em>  (Par. 2, art.  510, Penal Code.)  There were  no  mitigating  circumstances.   The penalty imposed should therefore be in the maximum degree, in accordance  with the provisions of paragraph 5 of article 503 of the Penal Code.  The maximum penalty imposed by law is imprisonment from six years ten months  and one day to ten years of <i>presidio mayor</i>.   Therefore the judgment of the lower court is hereby modified, and the  defendant is hereby sentenced to be imprisoned for a period of six years ten months and one day of presidio mayor, to indemnify Lim Chungque in the sum of Pl,000, the  amount of money robbed, with the accessory penalties of the law, and to pay the costs.</p>
