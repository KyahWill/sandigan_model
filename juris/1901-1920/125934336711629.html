				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> The evidence produced by  the  defendant to prove an alibi is not sufficient to overcome the positive testimony of two  persons who identified him as the  author  of the assault in question.  The judgment can not, therefore, be reversed on that ground.</p>
<p> Gregorio de Leon, the person attacked, was so seriously injured that he was taken to a hospital.   While there, on the 24th day of August, eight days after the injury was inflicted, he signed,  in the presence of the defendant, apparently, a written  statement as  to the occurrence.  He recovered from his injuries, and at the time of the trial was in  the provinces.</p>
<p> This  statement was formally offered in evidence at the trial below. No objection was made thereto by the defendant or his counsel, and it was  admitted. In this court the lawyer for the appellant claims that this statement should not have been  received.  This presents the only  serious question in the case.  The written declaration was  doubtless inadmissible, but  the defendant did  not  object to its  reception.   Why he  did not the record does not show. In  certain respects  the statement  contradicted the testimony of the other eyewitness who had already given his evidence at the time this declaration was offered.  If Gregorio had been  called to testify in  court he might have explained these contradictions  and  in other respects made the Government's case stronger than the statement made it.  The lawyer who represents the defendant here  did so below.   Considerations  such  as these may  have induced him to refrain  from  objecting.  But whatever his reasons were,  we can  not hold that  he had a right  to remain silentâ€”submit  the case on  this short statement of the injured person; have the chance of an acquittal by reason of its defects, and when the  judgment went against him say in this court, for  the first time, that the statement should not have been received.  When it was  offered he should hav.e objected to  it.  From his failure to do so may be presumed his consent that  it might be received.  It is now too late to withdraw that consent.   The judgment is confirmed with costs of this instance against the appellant.</p>
<p> <em> Arellano,  C. J., Torres, Cooper,</em> and <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p> <em>Smith</em> and <em>Mapa, JJ.,</em> did not sit in this case.</p>
