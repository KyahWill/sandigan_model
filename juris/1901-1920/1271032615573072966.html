				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is&nbsp; an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of the Province&nbsp; of Pangasinan,&nbsp; Hon. Isidro Paredes presiding, convicting the&nbsp; appellants of the crime of theft&nbsp; and&nbsp; sentencing each one of them to&nbsp; one year and one day of <i>presidio correccional,</i> accessories and costs, and also to the return of the&nbsp; property stolen or&nbsp; the value thereof, not to exceed P110.<br><br>It appears that one Feliciano de la Pasion was the&nbsp; owner of a young carabao, about 3 years of age, valued at P110, largely&nbsp; white in color, about three and&nbsp; one-half feet in height,&nbsp; without&nbsp; brands,&nbsp; with&nbsp; the horns curved&nbsp; slightly downward and a little longer than the&nbsp; ears.&nbsp; On the night of the 22d of&nbsp; May,&nbsp; 1909, it was tied with a rope near&nbsp; the house of the&nbsp; owner, situated in&nbsp; Poponto, municipality of Bautista,&nbsp; Province of Pangasinan.&nbsp; Sometime during that night or the early&nbsp; morning the young&nbsp; carabao&nbsp; was stolen. Upon examination&nbsp; it was found that the rope with&nbsp; which it&nbsp; had been tied the night before had been cut in&nbsp; two and the carabao taken away, the gate to the in closure in which it was tied having been forcibly opened.&nbsp;&nbsp; For several days the owner, in company with certain of his neighbors, visited the various barrios in that locality in search of said carabao, but without&nbsp; avail.&nbsp; Same&nbsp; days afterwards and on about the 5th day&nbsp; of June, 1909, Irineo&nbsp; Daquigan and Teofilo Bautista,&nbsp; being in a place a little west of the municipality of San Manuel, Province of Pangasinan,&nbsp; saw the two accused&nbsp; in&nbsp; this case,&nbsp; Mariano Caralipio and Cipriano Fernando, going in the direction of the pueblo of San Manuel, driving the carabao in question, upon which the accused Mariano Caralipio was riding.&nbsp; The two witnesses immediately&nbsp; communicated the fact to&nbsp; Feliciano de&nbsp; la Pasion, and the latter, in company&nbsp; with them, went to&nbsp; the pueblo of San Manuel and there found the carabao in&nbsp; question in&nbsp; the possession of&nbsp; the&nbsp; municipal treasurer.&nbsp; Pasion claimed the&nbsp; carabao,&nbsp; but&nbsp; as Cipriano Fernando, one of the accused, claimed it also, the municipal treasurer, after an investigation relative to the ownership, turned it over to Cipriano&nbsp; Fernando, who, on the 25th of June of the same year,&nbsp; took it to the municipality of Moncada, where it was branded by the authorities, from whom he received the corresponding&nbsp; certificate of ownership.&nbsp; Thereafter Feliciano de la Pasion made complaint&nbsp; to the authorities against&nbsp; the accused, charging them with the theft of his carabao.&nbsp; A preliminary investigation was had before Marciano de Guzman,&nbsp; justice of the peace of Bautista.&nbsp; From such examination the magistrate found that sufficient facts had been proved to&nbsp; demonstrate that a crime had been committed and that there was reasonable ground to believe that the accused had committed the same; whereupon&nbsp; he held them to await the action of the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of the province. Pasion proved his ownership of the young carabao by his own testimony and by the testimony of several&nbsp; other witnesses, who identified it beyond question.&nbsp; On&nbsp; that trial the said justice of the peace, Marciano de Guzman, who had&nbsp; conducted&nbsp; the preliminary investigation in the case, was&nbsp; presented&nbsp; as&nbsp; a witness.<br><br>During the progress of that preliminary investigation the said justice, to satisfy himself fully&nbsp; as to who&nbsp; was the real owner&nbsp; of the young&nbsp; carabao, made a&nbsp; very practical test to that end.&nbsp; He&nbsp; required the accused Cipriano Fernando,&nbsp; who&nbsp; claimed&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; young carabao belonged to him&nbsp; and that he still&nbsp; owned the mother of it, to bring the alleged mother of the young carabao to his office, where the&nbsp; preliminary investigation was&nbsp; being&nbsp; held.&nbsp; He&nbsp; also required Pasion, the other claimant&nbsp; of the young carabao, to bring to the&nbsp; office of the justice of the peace the caraballa which he claimed was the mother of the young carabao in question.&nbsp; This was&nbsp; done.&nbsp; Under&nbsp; the orders&nbsp; of&nbsp; the justice of the peace, the young carabao was placed at the farther end of an inclosure, and the two <i>caraballas</i>, alleged mothers of the young&nbsp; carabao,&nbsp; were driven&nbsp; through an opening in the&nbsp; fence at&nbsp; the&nbsp; other&nbsp; end of&nbsp; the inclosure, the caraballa belonging to the accused walking 15 or 20 feet ahead of the <i>caraballa</i> belonging to Pasion.&nbsp;&nbsp; The young carabao, upon seeing the two <i>caraballas </i>enter the inclosure, run&nbsp; forward to meet them.&nbsp;&nbsp; It paid not the slightest attention&nbsp; to&nbsp; the <i>caraballa</i>&nbsp; of&nbsp; the accused, which&nbsp; it was the first to meet, but passed it by with utter indifference to meet the <i>caraballa</i> of Pasion, which&nbsp; it greeted with&nbsp; the customary&nbsp; salutation which a young carabao gives to its mother, manifesting all the signs which are usually shown by a young for&nbsp; a long lost mother.<br><br>This&nbsp; witness&nbsp; further stated that he then&nbsp; separated the two&nbsp; <i>caraballas</i>&nbsp; from the young&nbsp; carabao,&nbsp; after which he turned the two <i>caraballas</i> loose.&nbsp; The <i>caraballa </i>of Feliciano de la Pasion immediately began searching for the young carabao, while&nbsp; that of the&nbsp; accused&nbsp; showed&nbsp; itself entirely indifferent to its whereabouts.&nbsp; According to the witnesses Feliciano de&nbsp; la&nbsp; Pasion, Irineo Daquigan,&nbsp; Teofilo&nbsp; Bautista and&nbsp; Vidal&nbsp; del Rosario, these same experiments were tried before&nbsp; the&nbsp; municipal&nbsp; treasurer of San Manuel&nbsp; with substantially the same results.<br><br>We have not the slightest doubt that the young carabao in dispute in this case is and was the property of Feliciano de la Pasion.&nbsp; This being so, it is equally undoubted that it was&nbsp; feloniously taken from&nbsp; his&nbsp; possession by the accused in this case.&nbsp; It is a point&nbsp; worthy of note that the accused Cipriano&nbsp; Fernando admitted upon&nbsp; cross-examination that he had branded and obtained&nbsp; certificates of property for two young carabaos of&nbsp; substantially the same age as the one in dispute, one in the month&nbsp; of November, 1908, and the other in the month of February,&nbsp; 1909, both carabaos of the&nbsp; same <i>caraballa</i>&nbsp; which he claimed was the mother of the young carabao&nbsp; in question.&nbsp; As&nbsp; the young&nbsp; carabao in dispute is alleged also to be a calf of the same caraballa of the&nbsp; accused&nbsp; and&nbsp; of substantially the same age as the two&nbsp; young&nbsp; carabaos&nbsp; referred to,&nbsp; it presents the&nbsp; unusual spectacle of seeing a <i>caraballa</i> the mother of three carabaos in less&nbsp; than&nbsp; two years.&nbsp; There is nothing&nbsp; whatever in the case which indicates that the testimony of the complainant and&nbsp; his witnesses is false.&nbsp; On the other hand, every circumstance which has been presented in this&nbsp; case indicates that that testimony is true.&nbsp; It is to be wondered why&nbsp; the&nbsp; accused, being a&nbsp; resident of one&nbsp; municipality, in which he had caused to be&nbsp; branded two young carabaos during&nbsp; the&nbsp; prior&nbsp; year&nbsp; and from&nbsp; which&nbsp; he&nbsp; had received certificates of property of the same, should take the carabao in question&nbsp; to another municipality for the&nbsp; same purpose. We are&nbsp; of the opinion that the&nbsp; conclusions of the&nbsp; learned trial court are fully sustained by&nbsp; the proofs.&nbsp;&nbsp; (U. S. <i>vs.</i> Jamero, 10 Phil. Rep.,&nbsp; 137; U. S. <i>vs</i>. Soriano, 9 Phil. Rep., 441; U. S. <i>vs</i>.&nbsp; Paguia, 10 Phil.&nbsp; Rep., 90; U. S.<i> vs. </i> Espia, 16 Phil. Rep., 506.)<br><br>The judgment&nbsp; of&nbsp; conviction is&nbsp; affirmed,&nbsp; with costs against&nbsp; the appellants.<br><br><i>Arellano,&nbsp; C.
