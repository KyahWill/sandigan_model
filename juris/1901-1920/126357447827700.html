				<H3>VALENTINA PALMA,  PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. JORGE FERNANDEZ AND THE MUNICIPALITY OF  BINMALEY, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The plain tilt'  alleged in her complaint that she was the owner of a piece of land, a. part of which, by an inundation in 1872, had become covered with water,  and that the defendant, Fernandez, under a license  from  the other defendant, the municipality of Binmalay, had  constructed u fishing apparatus upon this property and had caught fish there to her damage in  the amount of 500 pesos.  Judgment was rendered against both of the defendants in the court below to the effect that the property in question belonged to the plaintiff and that they pay her 170 pesos for damages.  The defendants have brought the case here by bill of exceptions.</p>
<p>Act  No. 303,  section  1,  paragraph (j), in enumerating the powers of the municipalities, says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The granting  of the privilege of fisheries in  freshwater streams, lakes, and tidal  streams  included within the municipality and not the property of any private individual  *  *  *."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The court below found, among other things, as follows :</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"That in  the year 1872, as a result of the flood, part of the land was  washed away, the said portion  having ever since been  covered with water, forming  an estuary, the plaintiff having used the same by herself  and  through her tenants as a fishery  from the time of the flood until the month of March, 1904.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
  <p>"The defendants claim that the portion of water covering the land of  the plaintiff is part of a river which is public property  and that, therefore, the municipality has  the right to either lease it or authorize the placing therein of fishing apparatus  to those who  pay the tax fixed by the municipality.  They  also allege that the  estuary  is navigable and that as a result of the flood the plaintiff has lost her rights to the said portion thus covered by the water.</p>
  <p>"The court is of the opinion that the weight of evidence justifies a finding  that the  water covering that portion of the land of  the plaintiff is not a part  of the river but an insignificant estuary  which takes its water from the river Agno and is affected by the tide; but that  in normal  times no part of  the water comes from any spring or  stream, there being  therein several fisheries operated by their own owners without any authority, license, or intervention on the part of the defendant municipality of Binmaley."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These findings are sustained by the preponderance of the evidence.  In any event they are not plainly and manifestly against the weight of the evidence and they are, we think, decisive of the case.  Neither under Act No.  303, above quoted, nor  the Law of Waters of 1866, nor the provisions of article 407  of the  Civil Code, is the <em>estero</em> in question public property.   It is not a stream of water.  There is no current in it and at times it is completely dry.  The fact that it is affected by the tide can not make it public  property.  If this fact were determinative of  the  question of public or private property, it  would, as suggested by  the appellee  in her brief, make public property  many of the <em>nipa</em> lands in the Islands.</p>
<p>What lias been said disposes of all the assignments of error except one.  Judgment  in the court below was rendered not only against the defendant, Fernandez, but also against the municipality.  The only action taken by the municipality according to the evidence was the granting of a  license  to Fernandez to fish in this place.   That license was not introduced in evidence and its terms do not appear. The mere granting of a license in such a case, without any other affirmative act on the part of the  municipality, can not,  we think, make the municipality liable  for damages caused to a third person by wrongful acts committed by the licensee.   The effect of this license is simply to say that so far as the licensor is  concerned it will  not interfere with the acts of the licensee.</p>
<p>The judgment of the court below as to  the defendant Fernandez is affirmed.   The judgment as to the municipality of Bininaley is reversed and  it is absolved from the complaint with  the costs of the first instance. No  costs will be allowed to either party in this court.</p>
<p>After the expiration  of  twenty days let  judgment be entered in accordance herewith, and ten days thereafter let the case be remanded to the court below  for proper action. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C J., Tores, Mapa, Carson,</em> and  <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em>Johnson, J.,</em> did not sit in this case.<br>
