				<BR><STRONG>AVANCEÑA, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">From the admission and testimony of the defendant, Juan Dinola, it appears 
that on January 31, 1917, in the municipality of Alangalang, Province of Leyte, 
he had been distilling tuba, was carrying P5, and, on passing in front of a 
house where a festival was being held, saw on the stairs his cousin Guillermo 
Dinola, the deceased, to whose inquiry as to whether he had any money by him, 
the defendant replied that he had, for the purpose of paying some laborers. The 
deceased asked him for that sum, giving as a reason for his request, that he, 
Guillermo, had lost in gambling and had to pay a person from whom he had 
borrowed money. The deceased excused himself for making the request, by saying 
that he was afraid that his wife would scold him because of that loss. Guillermo 
inquired for how many laborers the money was that the defendant was carrying, 
and when the defendant drew forth the money to show it to Guillermo, the latter 
tried to seized it from him, but the defendant, understanding the evil intention 
of the deceased, would not let go of the money. Then the deceased, with his left 
hand, caught hold of the defendant's thumb and. with his right hand drew from 
his own pocket a penknife, with which he assaulted the defendant, wounding him 
with it, first in the shoulder, then in the belly. The defendant had been 
receding until he reached a partition-wall, and thereupon the deceased, seeing 
that the defendant was wounded, let go of the money and caught him by the 
throat, to strangle him. Thereupon, the defendant, believing that the deceased 
intended to kill him, made use of the knife that he was carrying and had been 
employing in connection with the distillation of <em>tuba</em>, and with it 
wounded the deceased in the stomach, on which account the deceased let go of the 
defendant, but again assaulted him. The defendant went on warding off his 
assailant's blows and, on the occasion of this defense, inflicted upon him other 
wounds. When the deceased gave cries for help, calling his brother, the 
defendant asked the deceased to pardon him, left the place and forthwith 
surrendered himself to the chief of police.
<p>This admission and testimony of the defendant is the only corroborative 
evidence there is in this cause, bearing on the commission and details of the 
alleged crime. One Isidoro Tañada was present when the occurrence took place, 
but was not presented as a witness. No evidence whatever was introduced to rebut 
the testimony given by the defendant.</p>
<p>When the evidence in a cause for homicide is the uncontradicted testimony of 
the defendant, and the facts declared by him are likely, they should be 
accepted; and when they involve exculpatory circumstances that show that the 
defendant acted in self-defense, he should be held to be exempt from criminal 
liability.</p>
<p>We find nothing unlikely in the facts testified to by the defendant. The 
Attorney-General, in his brief, has called our attention to the very 
unlikelihood of the deceased having been able to open his pocketknife while he 
was holding the defendant with his left hand. Whether or not he could have done 
so, depends on the conditions of that weapon: they might have been such that it 
could have been opened with only one hand. The pocketknife was not presented in 
evidence. In order to show its conditions, reference was made to another 
pocketknife which, as the defendant testified. was similar to the one used by 
the deceased; but neither was this other pocketknife introduced in evidence. We 
have nothing in sight that might guide us in establishing any positive 
conclusion that the pocketknife used by the deceased was of such conditions that 
it is unlikely that he could have opened the blade only with his right hand. For 
want of such data, we should not accept a conclusion adverse to the defendant. 
But even supposing that that knife could not have been opened with only one 
hand, the conclusion does not necessarily follow that the deceased could not 
have opened it. By a sight movement he might have joined both hands for the 
purpose of opening it, as with his left hand he was holding the defendant only 
by the thumb, and, to a certain extent, had the fingers of this hand free to 
open the blade; and, as all this required but a simple manipulation, performable 
in a very brief space of time, it is not unlikely that the deceased may have 
been able to open the knife under these circumstances.</p>
<p>The trial court rejected the defendant's testimony in the part thereof 
disculpatory to him, found him guilty of the crime of homicide, and sentenced 
him to 14 years, S months, and one day of <em>reclusion temporal</em>, with the 
corresponding accessory penalties, and to pay an indemnity of P1,000 to the 
family of the deceased.</p>
<p>In rejecting the defendant's testimony in the part thereof favorable to him, 
the court founded the rejection on two considerations:</p>
<p>One was his finding the defendant's testimony contradictory. The defendant, 
answering repeated and insistent crossquestions, stated that the deceased with 
his <em>left hand</em> was holding the defendant by the thumb, and with his 
<em>right hand</em> assaulted him with the pocketknife. In order to show that 
the defendant contradicted himself in respect to this detail, the court 
reproduced the following part of the interrogatory: "Q. <em>But how could, he 
wound you, if he did not let go of you?</em>—A. <em>With his right hand he 
caught me by the thumb</em>." This quotation appears in the record as follows: 
"Q. <em>But, then, how could he wound you, if he did not let go of you?</em>—A. 
<em>With his right hand he caught me by the thumb, and wounded me with his right 
hand.</em>" Note that the last words of the answer were omitted by the court. 
After the defendant had repeatedly and uniformly answered that the deceased with 
his <em>left hand</em> caught him by the thumb, his last answer, that he did so 
with his<em> right hand</em>, might have been only a slip of the tongue, made 
after wearisome cross- questions on this same detail. It is strange that he 
should have given this answer which is so at variance with what ha had most 
satisfactorily explained in his previous answers. At all events, there appears 
to be no just reason why the defendant's liability should be made to depend on 
so trivial a detail.</p>
<p>The other consideration which the court took into account in convicting the 
defendant is, as stated in the judgment, <em>that the eyewitness Isidoro Tañada 
was biased in favor of the prosecution</em>. The court arrived at this 
conclusion from the attitude of the defense as manifested by the statement it 
made before the court and which is as follows: <em>"The defense closes its 
evidence. I call attention to the fact that Isidoro Tañada, places himself at 
the disposal of the prosecuting attorney. It is to save time."</em> The court 
appears to maintain the opinion that if this witness had been presented he would 
have testified against the defense. We do not deem this deduction good. The 
testimony of this witness would have been merely corroborative evidence for the 
defense. The presumption that the evidence omitted by a party would, if 
presented, be adverse to him, is not applicable to merely corroborative 
evidence. But such omission is rebutting evidence for the prosecution, and to 
this latter that presumption is more properly applicable. Be this as it may, 
such presumption is not applicable when the evidence is at the disposal of both 
parties, because, in such a case, it has the same weight against the one as 
against the other party.</p>
<p>Accepting the theory of the defendant, it follows that he was unlawfully 
assaulted by the deceased, without having provoked the assault, and, in view of 
the kind of weapon that the deceased used in this assault and his resolute 
intention to assault the defendant, the latter, in repelling the assault with 
another weapon of similar conditions, thereby causing his assailant's death, 
acted in self-defense.</p>
<p>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment appealed from is reversed and the 
defendant is relieved from all criminal liability, with the costs <em>de 
officio</em>; and it is ordered that he be immediately released from 
custody.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson, Carson, Araullo, Street, Malcolm</em>, 
and <em>Fisher, JJ.</em>, concur.</p></div>
