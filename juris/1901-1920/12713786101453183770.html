				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"> This was an action commenced by the plaintiff, as assignor&nbsp; of certain claims held by Tomas Luna&nbsp; Munoz against the defendant, on the 28th day of April, 1903, in the Court of First instance of the city of Manila, for the purpose of recovering of the city of Manila the&nbsp; sum of 5,621.40, with interest and costs.<br><br>The complaint contains three separate causes of action against the defendant, two of them being for coal sold and delivered to&nbsp; the predecessor of the present city of Manila, the <i>Ayuntamiento de Manila,</i>, as administrator <i>de las aguas de Carriedo</i>, for&nbsp; which the plaintiff claims there was due him upon the first cause&nbsp; of action the sum&nbsp; of 3,116.40 and upon the third cause of&nbsp; action the sum of P585.&nbsp; The second cause of action alleges that the plaintiff deposited with the said<i> Ayuntamiento de Manila</i> the sum of 1,920 as a guaranty for the fulfillment of the contract sued upon. The plaintiff prayed for judgment for the sum of P5,621.40, with interest and costs.<br><br>After the respective parties had filed their pleadings they entered into a stipulation as to the facts which should be admitted as true in said cause, which stipulation is as follows:<br><blockquote>"Now come the respective parties hereto, plaintiff and defendant, duly represented by counsel, and stipulate and agree that, for the purposes of the above-entitled&nbsp; action, the following statement of facts shall be regarded as established and proved and that the&nbsp; decision&nbsp; in&nbsp; said above entitled action shall be based upon said statement&nbsp; of facts:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">"I<br></div><br>"That the defendant, the city of Manila, is now and ever since the 31st day of July, 1901, has been a municipal corporation, duly organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the Philippine Islands.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">"II.<br></div><br>"That on the 11th day of June, 1897, and for many years prior thereto and for more than one year thereafter, the <i>Ayuntamietito</i> of Manila was a municipal corporation duly organized and&nbsp; existing under and&nbsp; by virtue of the laws of the Kingdom of Spain.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">"III.<br></div><br>"That on or about the 11th day of June 1897, Tomas Luna Muñoz made and entered into a certain contract with the said <i>Ayuntamiento</i> of Manila, said contract being in the terms and figures appearing in the copy thereof annexed to the complaint.&nbsp;

day of June, 1898, the <i>Ayuntamiento</i> of Manila had and received of plaintiff 39 tons of Australian coal&nbsp; for the uses and purposes&nbsp; of the said Carriedo waterworks; that said 39 tons of Australian coal was reasonably worth the sum of 15 pesos per ton, or a sum total of 585 pesos.&nbsp; That thereafter and&nbsp; on or about the 26th day of July, 1898, the said plaintiff&nbsp; made due demand in the manner required by law for the payment of said sum of 585 pesos, Mexican currency.&nbsp;&nbsp; That notwithstanding&nbsp; said demand said sum&nbsp; was not paid by said <i>Ayuntamiento</i> of Manila.&nbsp; That thereafter, at various times, said plaintiff has similarly made due demand upon the Military Government of the United States in the Philippine Islands and of the defendant, the&nbsp; present city&nbsp; of Manila, for the payment of said sum so due as aforesaid, and the same has been successively refused and denied by said entity and still remains due and unpaid,<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">"XV.<br></div><br>"That the facts contained and&nbsp;

and the said Muñoz was made with reference to the funds in trust.<br><br>"(5) The court erred in finding that the property styled 'Carriedo funds and waterworks' is responsible for the payment of the debt sued for by plaintiff.<br><br>"(6) The court erred in finding that Ricardo Aguado was entitled to recover from defendant city of Manila as trustee of the Carriedo fund the sum of 7,982.38, Philippine currency, and the&nbsp; costs of this suit, or any sum of money whatever, for the coal delivered under his contract by the said Muñoz to the said <i>Ayuntamiento</i> of Manila, and for money deposited by said Muñoz with the said <i>Ayuntamiento</i> as guaranty for carrying out said contract.<br><br>"(7) The court erred in ordering execution against the property of the city of Manila consisting of waterworks and lands pertaining to it and to 94 shares of the Spanish Filipino Bank.<br><br>"(8) The court erred in finding that the said waterworks, lands, and shares are subject to execution.<br><br>"(9) The court erred in finding that the title of the city of Manila was not of absolute ownership but as trustee for said lands and shares.<br><br>"(10) The court erred in finding that the <i>Ayuntamiento</i> of Manila could be trustee of a trust estate for the benefit of its inhabitants and act as such with regard to contracts in respect of such funds.<br><br>"(11) The court erred in finding that the present city of Manila may be a trustee of a trust estate for the benefit of its inhabitants and act as such with regard to contracts in respect of such funds.<br><br>"(12) The court erred in finding that a particular fund belonging to the city of Manila can be subject to suit and execution before the same has been appropriated by the United States Philippine Commission.<br><br>"(13) The court erred&nbsp; in giving judgment in favor of plaintiff&nbsp; against defendant (sued as <i>fideicomisario</i> and administrator of the Carriedo waterworks) as trustee for said&nbsp; works.<br><br>"(14) The court erred&nbsp; in giving judgment against defendant and granting execution against its property."</blockquote>The appellant assigns many errors alleged to have been committed by the lower court.&nbsp; The questions presented by all the said assignments of error are (1) whether or not the present city of Manila is liable under the contracts referred to in the agreed statement of facts, for the obligations created therein by the old city of Manila (<i>Ayuntamiento de Manila</i>) as its successor, and (2) if it is, whether the plaintiff is entitled to a writ of execution against any of the property of the present city for the purpose of satisfying that liability when the same has been reduced to a judgment.<br><br>The lower court held that the present city of Manila was liable upon such contracts, upon the theory&nbsp; that it was the successor of the&nbsp; old city of Manila (<i>Ayuntamiento de Manila</i>) as it existed under the Spanish Government.&nbsp;&nbsp; The lower court held that the old city of Manila (<i>Ayuntamiento de Manila</i>) was the&nbsp; trustee and administrator of&nbsp; the Carriedo waterworks, and as such trustee was responsible for all&nbsp; the debts created or contracted in the administration of such works.&nbsp; This fact is neither admitted nor denied in the agreed statement of facts; neither is there anything in the record which justifies that conclusion.&nbsp; The&nbsp; contracts upon which the plaintiff relies for recovery in no way indicate that&nbsp; the <i>Ayuntamiento de Manila</i> made said contracts as trustee, nor in a representative capacity, but, upon the contrary, the contracts themselves show that they were made by the <i>Ayuntamiento de Manila</i> with the assignor of the present plaintiff simply as the <i>Ayuntamiento de Manila</i> and not as trustee or agent.&nbsp; Gur conclusion is, then, upon this question, that the contract which the assignor of the&nbsp; present plaintiff made with the <i>Ayuntamiento de Manila</i> was made with the old city in its corporate capacity simply and not in a representative capacity as trustee or agent.&nbsp;&nbsp; If there has been a violation of the terms of the contract such violation was made by the <i>Ayuntamienio de Manila</i> and not by the present city of Manila. This conclusion makes it unnecessary for us to discuss the relation of trust so ably presented in the briefs of the different attorneys.<br><br>A municipal corporation is a governmental agent of the state, given authority to govern the people in a limited portion of the state.&nbsp; This power, however, is limited&nbsp; to certain particular governmental functions, which are always expressed in writing in the form of a charter or grant of powers.&nbsp; To ascertain what this power is in each particular case, reference must be&nbsp; made&nbsp; to such grant&nbsp; of powers.&nbsp; Powers not expressly given therein or necessarily implied from such express powers can not he exercised by such governmental agent.<br><br>Experience has taught nations that when men congregate in large numbers in a small portion of the state, it is convenient to permit such persons, in a limited way, to govern themselves, the state retaining, the authority to modify, enlarge, restrain, or to absolutely revoke such grant of power at any time this convenience ceases.&nbsp; In all cases a municipal corporation is a mere instrumentality of the state for the convenient administration of a local government over limited territory,&nbsp; and as such is vested with subordinate power for local purposes only.&nbsp; The very moment it subverts these powers or arrogates to itself&nbsp; others not granted, or for any other reasons deemed to be sufficient, the&nbsp; state may revoke its authority,&nbsp; dissolve such corporation, and bring all the inhabitants and such property again under the direct control of the state&nbsp; or&nbsp; cental government in all their relations among themselves and with the state.&nbsp; There is no contract between the state and the public that the charter of a&nbsp; city shall not be at all times subject to legislative control.&nbsp; There is no such thing as a vested right held by any individual in the granting of legislative power to municipal corporations.&nbsp; (Meriwetlier <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Garrett, 102 U. S., 472, 511; U. S. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Ry. Co., 17 Wallace, 322; Commissioners <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Lucas, Treasurer, 93 U. S., 108; Philadelphia <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Fox, U Penn. State, 169; Cooley, Constitutional Limitations, 192, 193.)<br><br>Many instances might be cited to show where the central government has exercised this prerogative. It being a doctrine well established then that a municipal corporation is a mere agent of the state, what then is the status of said corporation when the state itself is destroyed? Certainly the&nbsp; general consequences of&nbsp; the death of the principal must follow in its effect upon, the authority of the agent.&nbsp; The death of the principal always revokes the agency&nbsp; when there are no vested rights involved.&nbsp; A municipal corporation has no vested right to exist as such.&nbsp; The state may at any time revoke its charter.&nbsp; Of course the state might, by such revocation, incur certain moral&nbsp; obligations, but the performance&nbsp; of these obligations would always rest upon the conscience of the law-making or charter-granting authority of the state.&nbsp; The courts have no equitable or legal authority to compel the state to comply with obligations of this kind in the absence of proper legislation.<br><br>The principal of the old city of Manila (<i>Ayuntamiento de Manila</i>) was the Spanish Government in the Philippine Islands,&nbsp; and when that Government, on the 11th day&nbsp; of April, 1899, at least, ceased to exercise any power or control&nbsp; over this territory (the Philippine Islands), all its agents, including the <i>Ayuntamiento de Manila</i>, also ceased to exist, and therefore this agent was without authority either, to make or to perform contracts.&nbsp; There was no functionary of either Government left with any authority whatever.&nbsp; The Spanish Government, with all its&nbsp; governmental agencies, upon the 11th day of April, 1899, at least, ceased to have or to exercise any functions within the Philippine Islands.&nbsp; Upon that day the people who formerly constituted the <i>Ayuntamiento de Manila</i> became subject to the general laws (not political) applicable to the whole territory and to such rules and&nbsp; regulations as the new authority might see fit to promulgate.&nbsp; After that date all persons who had rights or obligations preexisting&nbsp; against such defunct governments were left to their remedy against such defunct governments, unless such rights were vested rights, or unless by treaty obligations or otherwise the new government had in some way obligated itself to respond to such individuals.&nbsp; It becomes important, therefore,&nbsp; to ascertain whether the new authority has in any way obligated itself to respond to&nbsp; the plaintiff herein.&nbsp; Our attention is called to article 8 of the treaty of Paris.&nbsp;&nbsp; But this is a compact between the United States Government and the Crown of Spain, and of course the city of Manila could not, if it would, be obligated by any terms&nbsp; of that compact&nbsp; without an express authorization on the&nbsp; part&nbsp; of the proper power or authority.<br><br>The city of Manila is in no way the successor of the <i>Ayuntamiento de Manila</i> in law.&nbsp; The mere fact that the present authority in these Islands has given to the present city powers like those exercised by the <i>Ayuntamiento de Manila</i> in no way makes the former the successor of the latter.&nbsp; It is an entirely new organization, a new agent of a new principal, and only has such&nbsp; authority, such powers, and such obligations and responsibilities as the new principal has seen fit to grant and impose.&nbsp; The grant of powers (the Charter of Manila) has been examined in vain to find anything which would make the present city of Manila liable in any way to&nbsp; comply, even though it desired to do so, with the obligations contracted by the <i>Ayuntamiento de Manila</i>, and therefore we must hold, as we do hereby, that the present city of Manila is in no wise responsible to the plaintiff upon the contracts made between its assignor and the old city of Manila.<br><br>These foregoing conclusions do not amount to a denial of the obligations&nbsp; or a refusal to comply with the&nbsp; same. They are simply that the obligations upon which the plaintiff seeks to recover never were incurred by the present city of Manila; neither can the&nbsp; foregoing conclusions be construed to be&nbsp; an attempt to&nbsp; violate the terms of the contracts.&nbsp; They are&nbsp; simply to the&nbsp;&nbsp; effect that no contract obligation, with reference to&nbsp; the claim of the plaintiff, ever existed.<br><br>These conclusions make it unnecessary for us to discuss the second question above suggested, for the reason that the city not being liable upon the contract, no question as to the right to take out a writ of execution against the property of said city can arise in the present case.<br><br>For the foregoing reasons the judgment of the lower court is hereby revoked, and, without any finding&nbsp; as to costs, it is so&nbsp; ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Carson</i>, and <i>Willard, JJ., </i>concur.<br><i>Mapa, J.,</i> did not sit in this&nbsp; case.<br><i>Tracey, J.,</i> concurs in the result.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="NOSHADE" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Cases Nos. 3449, Vasquez, plaintiff; 3558, Rosario et al., plaintiffs; and 3703, Otero et al., plaintiffs, all seeking to charge the present government of Manila with liabilities of the old <i>Ayuntamiento de Manila</i>, were decided upon the same principle, citing Aguado <i>vs.</i> City of Manila.</div>
