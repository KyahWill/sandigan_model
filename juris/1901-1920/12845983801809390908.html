				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. BALDOMERA ESPARCIA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.

				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The defendant and appellant was charged in the Court of First Instance of 
Oriental Negros with the crime of serious physical injuries as punished by 
article 416, paragraph 1, of the Penal Code. She was convicted and sentenced 
under this provision. The facts established at the trial are so filthy that we 
feel that it will serve no good purpose to set them forth. We merely content 
ourselves with the statement that the findings of the trial court as to the 
sufficiency of the proof should be adhered to.
<p>The sole point which it is desirable to discuss is whether or not the crime 
committed is that defined and penalized by article 414 of the Penal Code. The 
English translation of this article reads: "Any person who shall intentionally 
castrate another shall suffer a penalty ranging from <em>reclusion temporal</em> 
to <em>reclusion perpetua</em>." The Spanish text, which should govern, uses the 
word "castrare," inadequately translated into English as "castrate," The word 
"capar," which is synonymous of "castrar," is defined in the Royal Academic 
Dictionary as the destruction of the organs of generation or conception. Clearly 
it is the intention of the law to punish any person who shall intentionally 
deprived another of any organ necessary for reproduction. An applicable 
construction is that of Viada in the following language:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"At the head of these crimes, according to their order of gravity, is the 
mutilation known by the name of 'castration' which consists of the amputation of 
whatever organ is necessary for generation. The law could not fail to punish 
with the utmost severity such a crime, which, although not destroying life, 
deprives a person of the means to transmit it. But bear in mind that according 
to this article in order for 'castration' to exist, it is indispensable that the 
'castration' be made purposely. The law does not look only to the result but 
also to the intention of the act. Consequently, if by reason of an injury or 
attack, a person is deprived of the organs of generation, the act, although 
voluntary, not being intentional to that end, it would not come under the 
provisions of this article, but under No. 2 of article 431." (Viada, Codigo 
Penal, vol. 3, p. 70. See to same effect, 4 Groizard, Cddigo Penal, p. 
525.)</p></blockquote>
<p>The fact that the fiscal erroneously classified the crime is of no importance 
since the body of the complaint sufficiently describes the crime penalized by 
article 414. There were present in the commission of the crime the aggravating 
circumstances of nocturnity, of being the spouse of the offended party, and of 
premeditation. Since the defendant is less than eighteen years of age, the 
penalty must be reduced one degree. Accordingly, the appropriate penalty is 
<em>prision mayor</em> in its maximum degree.</p>
<p>The defendant and appellant is found guilty of a violation of article 414 of 
the Penal Code and is sentenced to twelve years of <em>prision mayor</em>, With 
the costs of this instance. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Johnson, Carson, Araullo</em>, and <em>Street, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p></div>
