				<BR><STRONG>TRACEY, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The defendant being a councilor of the pueblo of Abucay, in the Province of Bataan, was accused  of  failing  to give prompt notice  to the provincial governor or inspector of police of the presence of <em>ladrones</em> or brigands, as required by section 5 of Act  No. 781, amending  Act No. 175.  It appears that on three occasions he gave such notice to the president of the  municipality,  who  transmitted  it to the inspector; it is claimed, however, that the three occasions upon which he was seen by  witnesses for the prosecution in conversation with Felix Encarnaci6n, the bandit chief, or his men, do not correspond in time and place with these notices, and  further  that the communication to the president did not satisfy the requirements of the statute.  On the other hand it is maintained that the  design  of the defendant was to forward through the president his report to the higher authorities and that  such was  the course taken.</p>
<p>Considering the  circumstances of time and place, the sending of word through the municipal president appears to have been the only available course open to the accused, as it does not seem to  have been possible for  him  to have reached either the  governor or the inspector personally; consequently  there  was  no breach of duty, as there might have been had immediate communication  by him with the governor or inspector been practicable.   The lack of correspondence  between the interviews testified to with Encarnacion  and  the  reports  sent by  the accused is not sufficiently established by the evidence to justify  his conviction of a crime; indeed, the fair conclusion is that they do correspond.</p>
<p>Therefore  the accused should be acquitted and set at liberty forthwith, with the costs of the case <em>de  oficio</em>.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Carson, </em>and <em>Willard, JJ., </em>concur.<br>
