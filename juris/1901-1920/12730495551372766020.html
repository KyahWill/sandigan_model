				<H3>THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, PETITIONER AND APPELLEE, VS. JOAQUIN ABRION ET AL., OBJECTORS. FRANCISCO G. PAR, APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The only question presented by the motion is whether or not the Supreme Court 
may declare a bill of exceptions abandoned and dismiss the appeal, on motion of 
the appellee, because the appellant had not caused the proper certified copies 
of the bill of exceptions to be filed in the clerk's office within the time 
mentioned in rule 14 of the Supreme Court.
<p>The facts important for a consideration of that question are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) That the Director of Lands on the <em>26th day of September, 1914</em>, 
presented a petition in the Court of First Instance of the Province of 
Pangasinan for the registration of 675 parcels or lots of land situated in the 
municipality of Urdaneta of the Province of Pangasinan, praying that said 
parcels of land be registered under the Cadastral Survey Act [No. 2259]; (2) 
that various oppositions were presented. Francisco G. Par, the appellant, 
claimed that he was. the owner of lots No. 2687, 3193 and 3199 and asked that 
they be registered in his name. The court denied his petition with reference to 
Lots No. 2687 and 3193; (3) that the decision denying the registration of said 
parcels of land was rendered on the <em>29th day of June, 1916</em>, 
notification oi which decision was not given until the 2d day of March, 1917, 
and, on the same day, the appellant presented a motion for a rehearing, which 
motion was denied on the 17th day of March, 1917, to which order the appellant 
duly excepted on the 20th day of March, 1917; (4) that a bill of exceptions was 
duly presented and filed in the office of the clerk on the 4th day of April, 
1917, and the judge approved and certified the said bill of exceptions on the 
14th day of April, 1917; (5) that so far as the record shows, nothing occurred 
in the prosecution or perfection of the appeal from the 14th day of April, 1917, 
until the 18th day of March, 1918, when the attorney for the appellee presented 
a motion, in the Supreme Court, which motion was accompanied by a certified copy 
of the bill of exceptions, praying that the appeal be dismissed for the reason 
that the appellant had not presented, nor <em>caused</em> to be presented, the 
bill of exceptions to the Supreme Court in accordance with the provisions of 
Rule No. 14; (6) that notice of the motion mentioned in the preceding paragraph 
was served upon the attorney for the appellant, and was set down for hearing on 
the 25th day of March, 1918, which motion was denied, for the reason that the 
appellee had not given timely notice of the same; (7) That said motion to 
dismiss was renewed and set down for hearing on the 8th day of July, 1918, and 
notice was served upon the attorney for the appellant on the 3rd day of May, 
1918, which motion was duly considered and granted, and the appeal was dismissed 
on the 9th day of July, 1918; (8) that the original bill of exceptions was not 
filed with the clerk of the Supreme Court until the 10th day of May, 1918; (9) 
that on the 4th day of September, 1918, the appellant, Francisco G. Par, 
appeared by a new attorney,v Demetrio B. Encarnacion, and on the 5th day of 
September, 1918, presented a motion for a reconsideration of the order of this 
court dismissing the appeal.</p>
<p>Section 143 of Act No. 190, among other things, provides that 
"<em>immediately</em> upon the allowance of a bill of exceptions by the judge, 
it shall be the duty of the clerk to transmit to the clerk of the Supreme Court 
the original bill of exceptions, etc." Said section (143) was amended by section 
2 of Act No. 1123. Said amendment, however, in no way affects the question 
before us.</p>
<p>Soon after said section 143 was adopted (in 1901), the Supreme Court 
promulgated what is known as rule 14 of the Rules of the Supreme Court. Said 
rule 14, among other things, provides that "within sixty days after a bill of 
exceptions is filed in the court below * * *, the appellant <em>shall cause the 
proper certified copy</em> to be filed in the clerk's office of this, court 
(Supreme Court.) If they are not so filed this court <em>will</em>, on 
application by the appellee and notice to the appellant, <em>declare</em> the 
bill of exceptions abandoned or the appeal dismissed, unless for cause then 
shown it extends the time for filing such copy." That rule has been in force for 
more than seventeen years and many bills of exceptions have been dismissed for 
noncompliance with its terms. While section 143 of Act No. 190, with its 
amendment (section 2 of Act No. 1123), provides that "it shall be the duty of 
the clerk to transmit to the Clerk of the Supreme Court the original bill of 
exceptions, etc." the duty is placed upon the appellant by rule 14, to <em>cause 
the proper certified copy</em> of the bill of exceptions to be filed in the 
clerk's office <em>within a period of sixty days</em>, after it has been 
approved and certified by the lower court.</p>
<p>In the present case, so far as the record shows, the appellant did absolutely 
nothing to <em>cause</em> a certified copy of the bill of exceptions to be 
presented in the Supreme Court from the 14th day of April, 1917, until the 10th 
day of May, 1918, and not then until after he had been notified twice (the first 
on or about the 16th day of March, 1918, and the second on the 3d day of May, 
1918) of the intention of the appellee to ask the Supreme Court to dismiss the 
appeal, for the very reason that the bill of exceptions had not been presented 
by the appellant within the time prescribed by the statute and the rule.</p>
<p>While, in the first instance, it is the duty, under the law, of the clerk of 
the Court of First Instance to immediately transmit to the clerk of the Supreme 
Court a certified copy of the bill of exceptions, it is also the duty, under 
rule 14, of the appellant to <em>cause to be presented</em> to the clerk of the 
Supreme Court, a <em>certified copy of the bill of exceptions</em> within a 
period of sixty days.</p>
<p>While section 143 of Act No. 190, as amended by section 2 of Act No. 1123, 
requires the clerk of the lower court to immediately transmit to the clerk of 
the Supreme Court the bill of exceptions, after approval, the said rule 14 
imposes upon the appellant the obligation to <em>cause</em> the said bill of 
exceptions, with a certified copy of the same, to be filed with the clerk of the 
Supreme Court within a period of sixty days. If the clerk fails to perform his 
legal duty, the appellant has his remedy. But the failure of the clerk to 
perform his legal duty is no justification for the appellant's failure to 
perform his. The appellant cannot justify his failure to comply with the rules 
of this court, and thus delay the final conclusion and decision of an appeal, by 
saying that the fault was that of the clerk of the lower court.</p>
<p>Considering that the appellant neither complied, nor attempted to comply, 
with the rules of this court, the motion for a reconsideration is denied.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Street, Malcolm, Avance√±a</em>, and <em>Fisher, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p></div>
