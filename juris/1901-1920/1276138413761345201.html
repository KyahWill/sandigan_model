				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> HOMICIDE; ROBBERY; ARTICLE 11, PENAL CODE. â€” From the court of First Instance of Manila. &nbsp;<br><br>Defendant was charged with homicide, with the aggravating circumstances of nocturnity, having killed a man while the latter was preventing him from commiting a robbery.&nbsp; The court below counterbalanced the aggravating circumstances of article 11, Penal Code, and sentenced the defendant to twelve years and one day of <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion</span>. Held: That when two circumstances are so balanced, the penalty should be imposed in its medium degree, as provided in rule 4, article 81 of the code; but as article 11 can not be considered in the crime of robbery, the proper penalty is twenty years of <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion</span>, with accessories and indemnity, and the judgment is so modified.<br><br>Per Arellano, C.J.<br>For appellant: Cayetano Hipolito.<br>For appellee: Solocitor-General Harvey.<br><br></div>
