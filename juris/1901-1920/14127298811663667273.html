				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The defendants were charged with a violation of the Gambling Law (Act No. 1757). The complaint alleged:<br>&nbsp; <blockquote><p> "That on or about October 15, 1916, in the municipality of Butuan, Province of Agusan, Philippine Islands, the above-named accused did, willfully, unlawfully and criminally, play the prohibited game of <em>monte</em>; an act committed with violation of law.</p>&nbsp; <p> "The accused Hermogenes Casion, Santiago Calo, and the Chinaman, Tiana, are recidivists."</p></blockquote><p> Upon said complaint the defendants were duly arrested, arraigned, tried, found guilty of the crime charged in the complaint, and sentenced as follows: Hermogenes Casion and Santiago Calo, for the reason that they had been convicted theretofore for the same crime, to be imprisoned for a period of two months; Juan Padaran was sentenced to be imprisoned for a period of 15 days; and Santiago Tiana, for the reason that he had theretofore been convicted twice for the same oifense, was sentenced to be imprisoned for the period of two months and 15 days, and each to pay one-fourth part of the costs. From that sentence each of the defendants appealed to this court, and made the following assignments of error:</p><blockquote>&nbsp; <p> "1. The court erred in holding in his judgment that the evidence conclusively shows that the game played was<em> monte</em> and not<em> banca-banca</em>.</p>&nbsp; <p> "2. The court erred in holding that the game called <em>banca-banca</em> is a game of chance and not one of sleight and skill.</p>&nbsp; <p> "3. The court erred in holding that the several pieces of <em>nipa</em> leaves, called <em>regla</em>, the playing-cards case, and the two pesos in money, all found on the mat spread out in the house where the game was played, are sufficient evidence for a conviction in this cause.<br>&nbsp; </p><p> "4. The court erred in pronouncing a sentence of conviction in this cause, beyond all reasonable doubt, without sufficient and conclusive proof to show the defendants' guilt."</p></blockquote><p> Said assignments of error may be discussed together. They all present but one question. The question is, whether or not the defendants, at the time and place mentioned in the complaint, were engaged in playing a game of chance in violation of Act No. 1757. It matters little what the particular game of chance is called, whether it is "monte," "<em>banca-banca</em>," "nones y p«res," "yampong," "liampo," or "hueteng," if the game is in fact a game of chance and is prohibited by the Gambling Law. The name of the game is immaterial. If the game is a game of chance the law cannot be evaded by playing the same under a new name. The name does not make the game. Whether it is a game of chance or not must be determined from the method by which it is played. The lower court, after hearing the evidence, made the following statement with reference to the game at which the defendants were found playing:<br>&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> "The defendants admitted that they played, not the game <em>of monte</em> but that called <em>banca-banca</em>. The latter is played with three cards, two for the banker* or dealer and one for the players. The three cards are laid face down and then are interchanged so rapidly that the players lose sight of their original positions. Then the bets are made. If the players, in making their bets, guess rightly any one of the cards, they win; otherwise, the 'bank' (dealer) wins. The defense maintains that this game is not one of chance, but of sleight and skill.</p><p> "The court finds that the game of <em>banca-banca</em>, as was stated by the defense, depends principally, if not entirely, on chance. It is similar to roulette, only that the manner of playing is the reverse, that is to say the cards are shuffled before the bets are made, as if the roulette were turned in a closed box, and afterwards the bets are made, each player choosing a certain number. But the court does not deem the allegation of the defense to have been proven, that the game played was <em>banca-banca</em>; the evidence conclusively shows that it was <em>monte</em>.&nbsp; </p><p> "The defense argues that <em>monte</em> cannot be played with three cards—one of them (being, in the case at bar) the nine of spades, found in the Chinaman Santiago Tiana's pocket—the only ones presented at the trial. That is true. But the court draws the conclusion that, during the raid, someone who might have come into the room before his arrest, perhaps the person who was dealing, or Hermogenes Casion, or Santiago Calo, carried away the cards of the stock. The officers did not search the room; they contented themselves with the two cards, the <em>reglas</em>, the card case and the money, which they found on the spread-out mat and supposed them to be sufficient evidence for conviction, as indeed this court does also."</p></blockquote><p><br>&nbsp; In addition to the findings of the lower court we have the following statements from the defendants themselves concerning the method of playing the particular game in question.<br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; Hermogenes Casion, one of the defendants, testified as follows concerning the method by which the particular game was played:<br> <br></p><div align="justify"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center" border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="31"><div align="justify">"Q. </div></td><td width="567"><div align="justify">Whose are these Exhibits C, D, and E?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></td><td width="32"><div align="justify">—</div></td><td width="27"><div align="justify">A. </div></td><td width="657"><div align="justify">They are mine.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">"Q. </div></td><td><div align="justify">Were you people playing with only these cards?</div></td><td><div align="justify">—</div></td><td><div align="justify">A. </div></td><td><div align="justify">Yes, sir.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">"Q. </div></td><td><div align="justify">In what does the game of <em>banca-banca</em> consists?

If, when the card bet on is turned up, it is found to be the Exhibit E—the card pointed out and chosen (beforehand) by the player, he wins, and if not, he loses. What I mean is that the player choses one of the three cards, and the other two are for the banker or dealer, ,If it is either of these two cards, the dealer wins, while the better stakes his bet on but one of them—the one chosen by him at the beginning of the game.

If we believe that the middle card is the one we chose, we bet on that card, laying our money beside it; and when the card is exhibited, if it is found that we have guessed right, we win; otherwise, we lose.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">"Q.</div></td><td> <div align="justify">In trying to follow the movements of the cards intended for the player, is there usually one, or several, of the players present who is, or are, more skillful in guessing the card correctly?</div></td><td height="21"><div align="justify">—</div></td><td><div align="justify">A. </div></td><td><div align="justify">There is, always.

Section 1 provides that, "Gambling, within the meaning of this Act, consists in the playing of any game for money or any representative of value or valuable consideration or thing the result of which game depends wholly or chiefly upon chance or hazard, or the use of any mechanical invention or contrivance to determine by chance the loser or winner of money or of any representative of value or of any valuable consideration or thing."</div><p> That the game at which the defendants were found playing at the time and place mentioned in the complaint was played for money is admitted by them. That the result of said game depended wholly upon chance or hazard is fully demonstrated by their own statements as to the method by which the game was played. Whether the game was "<em>banca-banca</em>" or "<em>monte</em>" or what not, the defendants themselves, in describing the method by which it was played, clearly showed that if the bettors in the game ever won their bets it was wholly a matter of chance.</p><p> The essence of gaming and wagering is that one party is to win and the other to lose upon a future event, which, at the time the wager is made is of uncertain nature—that is to say, if the event turns out one way A will lose, but if it turns out the other way he will win.</p><p> We find nothing in the record upon which a modification pf the sentence imposed by the lower court can be based. The sentence of the lower court is, therefore, hereby affirmed, with costs. So ordered.</p><p> <em>Arellano, C. J., Carson, Araullo, Street, </em>and <em>Malcolm, JJ.,</em> concur.</p><p> Judgment affirmed.</p></div>
