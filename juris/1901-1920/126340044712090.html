				<H3>MARIA ADELA, PETITIONER, VS. THE JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF  ILOCOS SUR, RESPONDENT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is  an original proceeding  in  this  court brought under the provisions of section 513 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which provides in part as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"When a judgment is rendered by a Court of First Instance  upon  default,  and  a party  thereto is  unjustly deprived of a hearing by  fraud,  accident, mistake, or excusable negligence, * * *  the party  so deprived of a hearing may  present his  petition to the Supreme Court within  sixty days after he first learns of the rendition of such judgment, and not thereafter, setting forth the facts and praying to have such judgment set aside."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It appears that Jose Bona commenced  an action in the Court of  First  Instance of Ilocos  Sur against Celestino Mina to recover the sum of 5,825.75 pesos.  The summons in the action was duly served upon the defendant therein on the 24th of November, 1902.  At the time of the service the defendant, Celestino Mina, delivered  to the municipal president who made  the service a statement in  writing to the effect that by reason of sickness he could not make a journey in order to appear before the Court of First Instance, and he presented at the same time a doctor's certificate to the effect that he was suffering from a disease of the lungs and could not travel either in a vehicle or on horseback.  On the 25th  of February, 1903, the plaintiff amended  his complaint, reducing the  amount claimed therein to 5,725.75 pesos.  A new summons was issued and duly served  upon the defendant, Celestino Mina, on the 9th of March, 1903.  The defendant then delivered to the municipal president who made the service a statement in writing of the same nature as the one delivered in November, and another doctor's certificate to the same effect as the former one.  These papers were forwarded to the office of the clerk of the court and were united to the expediente in the case.</p>
<p>Mina never appeared nor answered, and on the 15th of A.ugust, 1903, final judgment was entered against him by default for the recovery of the sum of 5,725.75 pesos, and costs.   The defendant, Mina, died on the 7th of November, 1903.  This proceeding was instituted by his widow, who claims to be a person interested in the case.</p>
<p>The defendant, Jose Bona, in his answer in this proceeding, alleges  that plaintiff can not maintain it.  We have not found it  necessary to decide this question because we think the facts in the case do not bring it within  the provisions of section 513.  The defendant, Celestino Mina, was duly served with process.  It was not necessary for him to appear personally in  the Court of First Instance; he could have employed a lawyer to appear for him.  The fact that he was sick and not able to travel, while it might have been an excuse for his not attending personally in court, was no excuse for his failure to employ  some one to appear for him.   It is probable that his failure to appear was due to his erroneous belief that he must, appear there personally. This  was a mistake of law and  for  such mistakes relief  can not,  as a general  rule, be  granted. (Zulueta <em>vs</em>.  Ziilueta, 1 Phil. Rep., 254; Guevara <em>vs.</em> Tuason &amp; Co., 1 Phil. Rep.,  27.)  We hold that the petition should be denied, with costs.  After expiration of ten days let  judgment be rendered in  accordance  herewith.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Carson,</em> and<em> Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
