				G.R. No. 3009, December 04, 1906</h4>
				<H3>FELICIDAD BUSTAMANTE ET AL., PLAINTIFFS AND  APPELLANTS, VS. CRISTOBAL BUSTAMANTE, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Judgment was rendered in the court  below in favor of the defendant.  Plaintiffs excepted to the judgment, moved for a new trial on the ground that it  was not justified by the evidence, and, that having been denied, they excepted, a bill of  exceptions was signed and filed  and has been sent to this court.  The appellants have not caused the evidence which was taken in  the court below'to be sent  here  but they filed a brief, asked that the case be placed upon  the calendar, and it has been submitted for decision. Tinder these circumstances we can  not review  the  evidence, and the only question is  whether, assuming  that all the facts stated in the  decision of  the  court below  are  true, they justify the judgment in favor of the defendant.</p>
<p>An examination of such decision will show that the judgment was fully justified by the facts therein  stated.   That judgment is accordingly  affirmed, with the costs of this instance  against the appellants.</p>
<p>After  the expiration of twenty days let judgment  be entered in accordance herewith, and  ten days  thereafter the case  be returned to the lower court for execution.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano,  C. J., Torres, Mapa, Carson,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
