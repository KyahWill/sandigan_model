					}</style>The present action was commenced in the Court of First Instance of the 
Province of Cebu, on the 29th of April,1912. Its purpose was to recover of the 
defendant the sum of P15,000.00, with interest and costs, being the balance of 
an amount due from the defendant to the plaintiff, for a certain amount of sugar 
which had been delivered by the plaintiff to the defendant, between the 1st of 
January, 1912, and the 31st of March, 1912.
<p>The defendant answered, denying generally all of the facts contained in the 
petition and also setting up several special defenses and a counterclaim against 
the plaintiff.</p>
<p>After hearing the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause, the 
Honorable Higinio Benitez, in a carefully prepared opinion in which the facts 
are set out in detail,<br>reached the conclusion that the defendant was indebted 
to the plaintiff in the sum of P5,861.20, with legal interest, from the 29th day 
of April, 1912, the date on which the present action was commenced. From that 
decision, the defendant appealed to this court and made a number of assignments 
of error, each of which present questions of fact only. Upon the questions of 
fact presented, we have made a careful examination of the record and, while 
there is some contradiction found in the testimony of the plaintiff and the 
defendant, we have reached the conclusion that the preponderance of the evidence 
clearly sustains the conclusions of the lower court. Its judgment is, therefore, 
hereby affirmed with costs.</p>
<p>It is so ordered.</p>
<p>After the expiration of 20 days from the date hereof let judgment be entered 
in accordance herewith, and 10 days thereafter let the record be returned to the 
court from whence it came, for execution.<br></p></div>
