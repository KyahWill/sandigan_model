				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In the matter of the proceedings touching the taxation of costs in the case of Roman Montes Regueiferos, as manager and liquidator for Ramirez &amp; Company, plaintiff, <i>vs</i>. Manuel Maria Rincon and Francisco Iznart, defendants,&nbsp; which appear to have been had at the instance of the clerk of this court, and in all other similar cases of taxation of costs&nbsp; in cases of&nbsp; appeals taken&nbsp; and conducted&nbsp; under the&nbsp; laws&nbsp; of procedure in force prior to the enactment of Act No. 190&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Civil Commission, we are unanimously of the opinion that while the clerk appears to have been in the due performance of his duty in seeking to have the question of costs&nbsp; in these proceedings disposed of, nevertheless in the interests of justice and in the sound administration of the business submitted to this court, it is&nbsp; neither expedient nor necessary that the clerk&nbsp; of this court should take further action looking to the recovery of the alleged costs therein, unless moved so to do by some party in&nbsp; interest.<br><br>In all such cases therefore, the clerk is directed to file the record and definitely and permanently suspend further action in the matter of alleged costs accrued&nbsp; or accruing thereunder, until the further order of the court.<br><br><i>Mapa, Johnson, </i>and <i>Moreland, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><i>Torres, J.</i>, dissents.<br></div>
