				G.R. No. 866, March 11, 1903</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED  STATES, COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE, VS.  APOLONIO SAMSON,  DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MAPA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> The accused is charged with the formation of a secret society with political purposes,  and his counsel has  filed in tliis court a petition, concurred  in by the  AttorneyGeneral, requesting that the benefits of the amnesty proclamation  of July 4, 1002, be extended tA defendant.</p>
<p> The offense in question is supposed to have been  committed in November, 1901,  and,  were the charges true, it would fall entirely under the sanction of section 9 of Act 292.  This court, having declared that all offenses defined and punished  under that Act are comprised in the amnesty proclamation  (The United  States vs.  Maximo Abad, decided October  22,1902),: it is clear that the defendant is entitled to the benefits of said amnesty.</p>
<p> Therefore we declare the  accused,  Apolonio  Samson, within the amnesty, provided he files in this court the  oath required by the proclamation.  So ordered.</p>
<p> <em> Arellano, C. J., Cooper, Willard,</em> and <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p> <em>Torres, J.,</em> did not sit in this case.</p>
