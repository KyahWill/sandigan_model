				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">William Thein is indebted to J. W. Meyers for a loan in the sum of P1,000.&nbsp; As security for payment of the loan, William Thein mortgaged to J. W. Meyers certain furniture owned by him which constitutes the fittings of&nbsp; a saloon situated in Calle Real, No, 124, in the&nbsp; district of Intramuros,&nbsp; Manila, to&nbsp; which effect a public instrument was executed on the 20th of June,&nbsp; 1908.<br><br>The premises at No. 124 Calle Real, district of Intramuros, are owned by Flora Broto, who leased the place to William Thein.&nbsp;&nbsp; The latter opened a saloon therein, of which the said furniture formed a part.<br><br>William Thein, as lessee, was indebted to the lessor, Flora Broto, in the sum of P215, for rent due for the months of June and July, 1908.<br><br>In the months of June&nbsp; and&nbsp; July, 1908, the furniture in question was in the place&nbsp; leased by William Thein, and, at the request of J. W. Meyers, was removed therefrom by the sheriff,&nbsp; notwithstanding&nbsp; the protest of&nbsp; Flora&nbsp; Broto,&nbsp; the lessor.<br><br>The said furniture was sold by the sheriff, and the proceeds of the sale amounted to P972.30.<br><br>Preference with respect to payments to be made from the above sum is claimed on the one hand by J. W. Mayers, as mortgage creditor, or rather as pledgee under contract, and on the other by Flora Broto, as mortgage creditor by operation of the law.<br><br>The contract of&nbsp; mortgage, or rather of pledge, invoked by J. W. Meyers, appears in the record.<br><br>The&nbsp; mortgage or legal&nbsp; pledge invoked by Flora Broto arises under article&nbsp; 1922 of the Civil Code, which provides:<br><blockquote>"With regard to specified personal property of the debtor, the following are preferred:<br><br>"1.&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br><center><br><div align="left">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></div></center><br>"7. Credits for rents and leases for one year with regard to the personal property of the lessee existing on the estate leased and on the fruits thereof." *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br><br>Paragraph&nbsp; 2 of said article also contains the following:<br><br>"Credits secured by a pledge which may be in the possession of the creditor, with regard to the thing pledged and to the extent&nbsp; of its value."<br></blockquote>Were this&nbsp; contest as to preference to be based only on the provisions of article 1922, paragraph 7, in favor of the lessor who is a defendant herein, and on paragraph. 2 in favor of the&nbsp; creditor-pledgee&nbsp; who is&nbsp; the plaintiff, it would have&nbsp; to be decided in favor&nbsp; of&nbsp; the lessor, for the reason that, in order-that the creditor-pledgee may enjoy the preference over the thing pledged to&nbsp; him, it is a necessary condition that the same shall be in his possession.&nbsp; As in this case, however, the furniture in question was not in the possession&nbsp; of the creditor Meyers, but in that of the debtor, William Thein, it follows that the creditor Meyers can not claim the preference&nbsp; prescribed&nbsp; by paragraph 2 of article 1922 of the Civil Code; while the lessor Broto,&nbsp; on the other hand, should have the preference specified in paragraph 7 over such personal property <i>existing </i>on the premises leased and in possession of the debtor Thein.<br><br>But the present contention as to preference does not rest upon&nbsp; the&nbsp; above-mentioned paragraphs 2&nbsp; and&nbsp; 7 of article 1922 of the Civil Code; on the part of the&nbsp; lessor it is based upon&nbsp; said&nbsp; paragraph 7 of article 1922 of the Civil Code, and, on the part of the creditor-pledgee, upon Act No. 1508 of the Philippine Commission, enacted July 2, 1906, under the provisions of which a chattel&nbsp; mortgage was executed by Thein in favor of Meyers.<br><br>Between the said Act and&nbsp; paragraph 2 of&nbsp; article 1922 already cited, as well as article 1863 of the Civil Code, there is now a radical difference.<br><br>While according to the Civil Code it is an essential requisite,&nbsp; in constituting a contract of pledge, that&nbsp; the creditor, or a third person named by common accord, be placed in possession of the pledge, under Act No. 1508 of the Philippine&nbsp; Commission&nbsp; this is&nbsp; not necessary in order to make the&nbsp; pledge&nbsp; valid and&nbsp; efficient as against the&nbsp; debtor; it is only necessary, to constitute a valid pledge&nbsp; as against third persons;&nbsp; notwithstanding this&nbsp; exception, the registration of the contract of pledge or mortgage of the personal property so given as security,&nbsp; in the registry&nbsp; of&nbsp; titles&nbsp; of the province, is equivalent to the actual delivery of possession to the creditor-pledgee.<br><br>The&nbsp; instrument of&nbsp; pledge or chattel mortgage executed by Thein in favor of Meyers is recorded in the registry of mortgages of its proper class (B. of E., 7).<br><br>Taking into consideration the different legal grounds on which each party bases his claim for&nbsp; preference over the other with respect to the personal property of the common debtor, it becomes necessary to&nbsp; determine&nbsp; in&nbsp; whose favor the contention should be decided,&nbsp; inasmuch as&nbsp; the proceeds of the sale&nbsp; of the said personal furniture&nbsp; is not sufficient to pay both claims.<br><br>The Court of First Instance of the city of Manila decided the question in favor of the lessor, granting to the defendant,&nbsp; Flora Broto, preference in the&nbsp; payment of her claim; the judgment "sentences William Thein, the other defendant,&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay&nbsp; the&nbsp; said Flora&nbsp; Broto the&nbsp; sum&nbsp; of P200,&nbsp; which sum must, as far as possible, be paid to the said defendant out of the proceeds of the sale of the furniture&nbsp; ma.de by the sheriff on the petition of the plaintiff, Meyers, to which end the latter is ordered to deliver to the said defendant out of the proceeds of said&nbsp; sale the above-mentioned sum of P200, being the amount of the aforesaid rent.&nbsp; And&nbsp; the plaintiff is further ordered to pay the costs of the action."<br><br>Against the foregoing judgment the plaintiff, Meyers, has appealed and, among other assignments of error, alleges the fact that preference was granted in favor of the claim for rent by the defendant, Flora Broto, over a credit secured by pledge executed and registered in accordance with the provisions of&nbsp; Act No. 1508 of the&nbsp; Philippine&nbsp; Commission. This&nbsp; is the only question to be resolved in&nbsp; this instance, for the reason that it was the only one decided by the court below.&nbsp; The grounds upon which the trial court has&nbsp; based its opinion&nbsp; are the following:<br><ol type="1"><li>That Act No.&nbsp; 1508&nbsp; does not repeal the provisions of the Civil&nbsp; Code with respect&nbsp; to this&nbsp; matter, because it does not mention such repeal.<br><br></li><li>&nbsp;That although the registration of a mortgage or pledge of personal property prejudices a third&nbsp; party, a privileged creditor, such&nbsp; as a&nbsp; lessor claiming&nbsp; the rent for his leased property, who, in law, has a mortgage upon the furniture of the lessee existing upon the premises, can not be considered as such third party, but any other third party by any other title different from that derived from the lease, recognizing no superior claim except one of&nbsp; pledge&nbsp; of personal property, and this only when the property is in the possession of the creditor-pledgee.<br><br></li><li>That said privilege or&nbsp; right of retention on the part of the lessor would be vain and illusory&nbsp; if preference were given to a credit secured by a pledge for the mere reason that it was&nbsp; registered, and.such registration would&nbsp; be contrary to the "right&nbsp; of possession," arising by operation of law and in favor of the&nbsp; lessor, over the furniture existing upon the premises leased.<br><br></li><li>That it being unnecessary that a legal mortgage, such as that of&nbsp; the lessor, be entered in the registry for&nbsp; the reason that it is created by the law itself, a&nbsp; contractual mortgage can&nbsp; not take&nbsp; preference&nbsp; over it&nbsp; for the&nbsp; mere reason that it&nbsp; is registered.<br><br></li><li>That as the debt of the lessee&nbsp; Thein in favor of&nbsp; the lessor Broto bears a date prior to that of the debtor Thein in favor of&nbsp; the creditor-pledgee Meyers, the&nbsp; mortgage created by law in favor of the former became effective before the contractual mortgage; so that, when the latter was registered, the former&nbsp; was already a lien upon the furniture pledged in favor of&nbsp; another.</li></ol>It becomes necessary to pass upon the nature of the contract of mortgage or pledge of personal property, in accordance&nbsp; with the&nbsp; provisions of section 3 of the said Act No. 1508&nbsp; which prescribes that&nbsp; "a chattel mortgage is a conditional <i>sale</i> of personal property as security for the payment of&nbsp; a&nbsp; debt,&nbsp; or&nbsp; the performance&nbsp; of&nbsp; some other&nbsp; obligation specified therein, the condition being that the sale shall&nbsp; be void&nbsp; upon the&nbsp; seller&nbsp; paying to the purchaser&nbsp; a&nbsp; sum&nbsp; of money or doing some other&nbsp; act named.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the condition is performed according to its terms the&nbsp; mortgage and sale immediately become void, and&nbsp; the&nbsp; mortgagee is thereby divested of his title."<br><br>From the language of the law&nbsp; it now appears: (1) That by&nbsp; the&nbsp; operation&nbsp; of Act No. 1508 the&nbsp; actual contract&nbsp; of pledge of the Civil&nbsp; Code degenerates into one of&nbsp; sale by mutual&nbsp; consent; (2) that,&nbsp; under Act No. 1508, a chattel mortgage is a&nbsp; sale with<i> pacto de retro</i>, almost equivalent to that&nbsp; under the same name in the Civil Code; (3) that as in&nbsp; a contract of sale with <i>pacto de retro</i> where the juridical dominion and possession of the thing sold pass to the purchaser as soon as the sale is consummated,&nbsp; so also in a chattel mortgage the dominion and possession of the mortgaged personal&nbsp; property pass to the creditor-pledgee, because, as the law provides, it is nothing more than a conditional sale; (4) that,&nbsp; in the same manner that a contract of&nbsp; sale&nbsp; is&nbsp; consummated by the&nbsp; delivery, either actual&nbsp; or symbolic,&nbsp; of the thing sold, which symbol of the delivery may be the inscription of the instrument in the registry, so&nbsp; also&nbsp; a chattel&nbsp; mortgage is consummated by a similar delivery, actual&nbsp; or symbolic, by means of an analogous inscription in the&nbsp; registry.<br><br>Therefore, so long as the&nbsp; mortgage exists, the&nbsp; dominion, with respect to the mortgaged personal property, rests with the creditor-pledgee from the time of the inscription of the mortgage in the registry, and the furniture ceases to be the property of the debtor for&nbsp; the reason that&nbsp; it&nbsp; has become the property of the creditor, in like manner as the dominion of a thing sold is transferred to the purchaser and ceases to belong to the&nbsp; vendor from the moment&nbsp; of&nbsp; the delivery thereof,&nbsp; as&nbsp; a result of&nbsp; the sale.&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the Civil Code, a thing given&nbsp; in pledge never&nbsp; becomes the property of&nbsp; the creditor-pledgee;&nbsp; the&nbsp; debtor continues to be&nbsp; the owner thereof (art. 1869); the creditor does not become the owner; he is&nbsp; nothing more than a creditor with a real right over the thing in&nbsp; his possession&nbsp; as a pledge, which he can dispose of through a notary at a public sale according to the Civil Code, the same as the creditor-pledgee may now, under the provisions of Act No. 1508, sell the pledge through the sheriff.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Civil Code,&nbsp; 1872; Act No. 1508, sec. 14.).<br><br>In view of the above&nbsp; it must be&nbsp; concluded:&nbsp; (1) That from June 20,1908, the furniture belonging to Thein, which existed in the house leased by Flora Broto, ceased to be the property of the first named and passed to the dominion and juridical possession of J. W.&nbsp; Meyers, the material possession alone continuing in the hands&nbsp; of Thein, and the property actually remaining in the leased&nbsp; building;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; that when" the lessor tried to collect the rent due for the months of June&nbsp; and July, 1908, the furniture&nbsp; that existed in the building&nbsp; was no&nbsp; longer the property of the lessee but belonged to a third person who had&nbsp; acquired it as a pledge which, under the law,&nbsp; is a sale, and as&nbsp; such the ownership is transferable, although conditionally and depending upon whether&nbsp; the debtor (the conditional seller)&nbsp; fulfills the condition subsequent, and is&nbsp; similar&nbsp; to a&nbsp; sale with pacto&nbsp; de retro;&nbsp; (3) the preference in the payment of rents due for one year, granted by&nbsp; paragraph 7 of article&nbsp; 1922, refers to "personal property of the&nbsp; lessee;" hence, as the furniture existing in the house leased no longer belongs to Thein but to J. W. Meyers,&nbsp; according to the public instrument recorded in the public&nbsp; registry, the said right of preference has not existed since the 20th of June, 1908; (4)&nbsp; the registration of a chattel mortgage, executed in accordance with Act No. 1508, is not in violation of the&nbsp; right of possession, supposed to have been acquired ex lege by the lessor over the&nbsp; furniture existing upon the leased premises, because no such right&nbsp; of possession is granted by the law to the lessor over the personal property of the lessee&nbsp; upon the estate leased; it is subject only to the payment of rent for one&nbsp; year, a condition which may become vain and illusory by a transaction&nbsp; like the one now in question, to wit, when the lessee executes a mortgage&nbsp; upon such personal property in favor of a third person, in the same manner as he could have previously performed these or other acts of disposal in respect thereto, inasmuch as his right to dispose of the same was not&nbsp; then, and&nbsp; is not now limited&nbsp; by reason of their being in&nbsp; a&nbsp; leased building; against this contingency the lessor should&nbsp; take proper precautions in order to ensure the payment of rent by means of an express lien thereon, since the personalty is merely affected by a tacit lien under the circumstances presumed by the law, to wit, that it belongs to the lessor and continues upon the premises and is liable only for the rent for one year.<br><br>The mortgage executed by Thein in favor of Meyers being a valid one, and considering the latter merely as a mortgage creditor (passing over the juridical effects of a sale with which the law has&nbsp; compared&nbsp; a&nbsp; chattel mortgage), he is entitled to have the property&nbsp; sold, as he did,&nbsp; through&nbsp; the sheriff, and to pay&nbsp; himself from the proceeds thereof in preference&nbsp; to subsequent mortgages,&nbsp; in accordance with said&nbsp; section 14 of Act No. 1508.&nbsp; Against this preference, that&nbsp; claimed in this case under paragraph 7 of article 1922 of the Civil Code can not prevail from the moment that it is admitted that,&nbsp; over and above the&nbsp; claim for rerit, that described in paragraph 2&nbsp; of the same article has the superior&nbsp; preference, whenever, in&nbsp; accordance with /its&nbsp; provisions, the pledge&nbsp; is in the possession of the creditor.&nbsp; The case&nbsp; at bar falls&nbsp; within the circumstances prescribed by section 4 of Act No. 1508 which reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"A chattel mortgage shall not be valid against any person except the mortgagor, his&nbsp; executors&nbsp; or administrators, unless&nbsp; the&nbsp; possession&nbsp; of the property&nbsp; is delivered to and retained&nbsp; by the mortgagee&nbsp; or&nbsp; unless the mortgage is recorded in the office of&nbsp; the register of deeds of the province *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; * ."<br></blockquote>The above provision does not, in this respect, repeal paragraph 2 of the said article 1922, but extends the provisions thereof&nbsp; by providing&nbsp; that the property&nbsp; pledged is to be considered&nbsp; as being delivered to the mortgage creditor and to be in his possession, if the mortgage is recorded in the office of the register of deeds of the province.&nbsp; The code only refers to the actual delivery of the pledge; Act No. 1508 provides both for the actual and for the symbolic delivery thereof by means of the registration of the title.<br><br>The judgment appealed from&nbsp; is&nbsp; reversed, without&nbsp; any special ruling as. to the costs of both instances.<br><br>It is hereby decided and decreed that, from the proceeds of the sale,&nbsp; preferential payment shall be made to the plaintiff J.&nbsp; W. Meyers; provided, however, that the debtor William Thein&nbsp; alone is adjudged to pay the claim of the latter as prayed for in the complaint.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson,</i> and <i>Moreland, JJ.</i>, concur.<br></div>
