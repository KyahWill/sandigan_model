				<H3>GEORGE E. WORCESTER, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. BUCKNALL STEAMSHIP LINES, LTD., DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>After the  entry of  judgment in the court below, and pending the submission of the case to this court on the bill of exceptions, a motion  was submitted by the defendant-appellant  for a new trial,  based on the discovery of new evidence.   This new evidence consists, substantially,  of a deposition of the master of the steamship <em>Kaloma </em>touching the destruction and loss of  her cargo as a result  of the sinking of the  ship in  the  harbor of Singapore for the purpose of extinguishing a dangerous fire which had broken out in the case-oil section of the cargo.</p>
<p>Ruling upon  this motion was reserved  pending the submission of the  appeal, and  it  now becomes our duty  to determine its admissibility in the light of the facts developed by the whole record and the  argument of counsel upon the whole case.</p>
<p>Upon a review of the whole record we are satisfied that if it be held  that a new  trial should not be granted for the purpose of admitting the above-mentioned deposition, then the judgment of the lower court must be affirmed; but that if a new trial should be granted, and this deposition is offered in evidence on  this new trial,  it is "of such a character" that in  all probability it would change the result.  If the deposition of the master of the <i>Kaloma </i>is to be believed, and there is nothing at present in the record to put it in doubt, the fire which broke out in her cargo at Singapore was not "caused by the  design or neglect" of the owners  or  of any of their employees, and the loss of the goods of the plaintiff which was occasioned thereby gave him no cause of action against the defendant,  in view of the express provisions  of the bill of lading, and of section 4282 of the Revised Statutes of the United States.</p>
<p>The question  as to the right of the defendant to have a new trial on the ground that the  evidence in question is newly discovered presents some difficulty.   We recognize the difficulty which, in the ordinary course of events,  would be encountered in securing the testimony of the responsible officers of an ocean-going ship as to the facts and circumstances attendant upon a fire aboard ship which occurred in a foreign port, many months prior to the institution of an action in our courts wherein the truth as to such facts and circumstances may  be found to be of vital importance.   At the same time we can not lose  sight of the fact that the master  of the <em>Kaloma</em>  continued  in  the employ of the defendant after the fire took place and up to the time when his deposition was actually taken, so that, in these days of cables and rapid transportation, there  would not seem to have  been an absolutely insuperable difficulty  in  securing from him such information supported by affidavits as would doubtless have secured the necessary continuance in the court below to give opportunity for the taking and submission of the deposition before the entry of judgment in first instance.</p>
<p>Having in mind, however, the amount involved and all the circumstances of the case, we think that under the provisions of subsection 2 of section 497 of the Code of Civil Procedure we should grant a  new trial upon the payment by defendant and appellant of all the costs accrued in both instances  up to the date of the  entry of judgment in  this court, and upon  the further  condition that plaintiff  will be permitted, if he elects so to do, to dismiss his complaint at any time within thirty  days from  the return of the record to the court below, without further special condemnation of costs.</p>
<p>Twenty days after notification of this decision to counsel for appellant,  let judgment be entered affirming the judgment of the court below  with  the costs  of this instance in favor of  appellee, unless prior thereto the defendant-appellant shall have filed with the clerk of this  court a written acceptance of the conditions provided for the allowance of a new trial, in which event judgment will be entered reversing the judgment of the court below without costs in this instance  and directing a new trial,  wherein such further and additional  evidence will be admitted as either of the parties desire to submit touching the loss of the goods of the plaintiff in the  harbor at Singapore.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Moreland,</em> and <em>Trent, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
