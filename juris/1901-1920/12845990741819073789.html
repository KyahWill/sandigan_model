				<h4>
				G.R. No. 12701, September 06, 1917</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. BONIFACIA SALAMAT, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The defendant and appellant caused the death of her husband by wounding him 
mortally with a dagger. This is admitted. But the prosecution presented no 
eyewitnesses to the homicide and showed no motive for its perpetration. We are 
therefore thrown back on the account of the defendant which naturally should be 
given due consideration. Therefore, not disregarding the testimony of the 
accused, but on the contrary giving it credence because consistent and 
generating a belief in the truthfulness of her statements, the narration of the 
defendant as to how she acted in self-defense to repel unlawful aggression is 
entirely reasonable. (U. S. <em>vs</em>. Bolar [1902], 1 Phil. Rep., 423; U. S. 
<em>vs</em>. De los Santos [1913], 24 Phil. Rep., 329.) It is almost needless to 
add that with the evidence in this state, we must hold that the defendant is 
exempted from criminal responsibility. (U. S. <em>vs</em>. Sosa [1905], 4 Phil. 
Rep., 104; U. S. <em>vs</em>. Mack [1907], 8 Phil. Rep., 701.)
<p>Agreeable to the recommendation of the Attorney-General, judgment is reversed 
and the defendant and appellant acquitted with the costs <em>de officio</em>. So 
ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Johnson, Carson, Araullo</em>, and <em>Street, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p></div>
