				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE, VS. BASILIO  TAGLE, DEFENDANT AND  APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>COOPER, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> The defendant, Basilio Tagle, is charged with the crime of abduction, alleged in the following manner:</p>
<p> That on  the 19th day  of February, 1902, in  the city of Manila, the defendant  willfully  and  illegally abducted Martina Baiia, a girl 13 years of age, against her will and with unchaste designs, punishable under the provisions of article 445  of the Penal  Code.</p>
<p> The Court of First Instance reached the conclusion from the testimony that the abduction was not against the will of the injured party, but found the defendant guilty, under the provisions of article 446, Penal Code, of the abduction of a virgin under 23 years of age and over 12, executed with her assent,  and sentenced him to the punishment of one year of <em>prision correccional</em> and to the payment of costs of the proceedings.  From this conviction the defendant appeals.</p>
<p> The defendant having been  charged with the abduction executed against the will and with unchaste designs, under the provisions of article 445 could not be convicted of the offense punishable under article 446 of the abduction of a virgin under 23 years of age and over 12, executed with her assent. The latter offense is a distinct and separate crime, and is not included in the former.  Therefore, the judgment of the Court of First Instance must be reversed unless the proof is sufficient to sustain the conviction for the offense with which he is charged in the complaint.<br>
  An examination of the testimony shows the following facts:</p>
<p> On the 19th day of February, 1902, Martina Bana, who was  then residing with her  mother, was sent out to purchase coal oil; she was met by the defendant, who seized her by the hand and placed her in a carromata, and against her will was taken to  the house of Valeriana Ponce and there remained about an hour.</p>
<p> From there she went with the defendant to Tondo, and was placed at the house of a friend of the defendant Tagle, and there remained for three days.</p>
<p> She was during this time in  company with one Federico Roxas, and the evidence is sufficient to show that the relations between Martina Bana and Federico Roxas were illicit.</p>
<p> She was afterwards  taken to the house of one  Benito Eusebio in Pasay, where she remained from the 21st of February to the 15th of March.  She seems to have been detained there against her will.</p>
<p> She was afterwards taken  to the house of the defendant and there again had meetings of an illicit nature with Federico Roxas.</p>
<p> The injured party was a near relative of Teodora Baffa, the <em>querida</em> of the defendant, and had formerly lived two years with them as a member their family.<br>
  <br>
We think the evidence is sufficient to show that the girl was carried off and detained by the defendant against her will, but the injured girl makes a direct and positive denial that the defendant ever said anything or did any act from the time of her abduction to  indicate that he personally had  any unchaste designs.  The circumstances  rather indicate that the girl was abducted and held by the defendant for the purpose of lending her to illicit intercourse with other men, and there being a want of this essential element in the case the evidence is insufficient to support the conviction under the provisions of article 445.</p>
<p> For the same reason a conviction could not be sustained if the defendant had been  charged with the offense defined and punishable under article 446.</p>
<p> By a decision of the supreme court of Spain of November 16, 1874, article 446 has been construed, and while this article does not prescribe  in express terms  that the abduction should be with unchaste designs, nevertheless the unchaste designs  are said to be inherent to the character of this crime, and it is necessary that they should occur in the act in order to constitute the crime of abduction punishable under this article.</p>
<p> The proof in the case is entirely sufficient to  support a conviction under article 444 of the Penal Code,  which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "Whosoever  shall habitually, or, taking advantage of his authority or of another's  trust,  promote or facilitate the prostitution or corruption of minors to satisfy the lusts of another, shall be  punished with the penalty  of <em>prision correccional</em>  in its minimum and  medium degrees  and absolute  temporary disqualification if he were a public official."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The defendant should have been prosecuted under this article of the Code.</p>
<p> For the  reasons above  stated we  reverse the judgment and  remand the case to the Court of First Instance with direction that a complaint be presented against the defendant under the provisions of article 444, and  that he be tried for the offense prescribed  in this article.  The  costs of the proceedings are adjudged <em>de oficio</em>.</p>
<p> <em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa,</em> and <em>Ladd,  JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p>  <em>Willard, J.,</em> concurring  in the result.</p>
