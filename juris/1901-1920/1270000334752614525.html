				<BR><STRONG>MORELAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">It&nbsp; appears in this&nbsp; case&nbsp; that in the year&nbsp; 1903 Matea Rosales leased to the defendant Florencio Noel the&nbsp; piece of land&nbsp; in&nbsp; litigation&nbsp; in&nbsp; this&nbsp; suit.&nbsp; The&nbsp; lessee&nbsp; immediately erected thereon a <em>camarin</em>&nbsp; which first served as a <i>tienda </i>for his daughter-in-law and later for a number of Chinamen to whom he sublet it.&nbsp; Matea Rosales died in the year 1904 and her&nbsp; niece Filomena&nbsp; succeeded&nbsp; her.&nbsp; The latter on&nbsp; the 15th&nbsp; of&nbsp; February, 1905, sold&nbsp; to Juan Mercado (through Mateo Mercado),&nbsp; with the&nbsp; right to repurchase, a certain parcel of land which&nbsp; is claimed by the&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; to have been&nbsp; all&nbsp; of the land which she inherited from her aunt Matea, including the portion leased to&nbsp; the defendant, and by the defendant to have been&nbsp; only such part of the land so inherited as had not been&nbsp; so leased.&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp; the&nbsp; 21st&nbsp; of March 1905,&nbsp; Filomena Rosales by a written instrument transferred to the&nbsp; defendant the land&nbsp; which in 1903 had been&nbsp; leased to him by Matea Rosales.&nbsp; After these transactions had occurred Filomena&nbsp; Rosales died intestate and an administrator was&nbsp; duly&nbsp; appointed to administer upon her estate.&nbsp; Sometime during the year 1907 it seems that the plaintiff presented to the commissioners&nbsp; appointed&nbsp; to receive&nbsp; claims against the&nbsp; estate&nbsp; of the said&nbsp; Filomena Rosales, deceased, the <em>debt</em> which had formed the consideration for the sale&nbsp; with&nbsp; the right&nbsp; to repurchase made&nbsp; to him&nbsp; by Matea Rosales, which&nbsp; claim was duly allowed&nbsp; as a&nbsp; valid and subsisting claim against said estate.&nbsp; From the record&nbsp; it appears that&nbsp; to&nbsp; satisfy&nbsp; said&nbsp; claim&nbsp; it was necessary to sell the land which had formed the&nbsp; subject matter of said sale with the right&nbsp; to repurchase and pursuant to such necessity said land was&nbsp; sold at public sale by the administrator of said estate sometime during the year&nbsp; 1907.&nbsp; The land&nbsp; so publicly sold was&nbsp; purchased&nbsp; by the plaintiff.&nbsp; The land advertised and&nbsp; sold by the administrator was described&nbsp; as all of&nbsp; the land of which the said Matea Rosales died seized,&nbsp; including the land theretofore leased and sold to&nbsp; Florencio Noel as heretofore mentioned. The&nbsp; defendant,&nbsp; on&nbsp; being notified&nbsp; of the&nbsp; attempt of said administrator to sell the parcel of land of which he claimed to be the owner,&nbsp; entered&nbsp; a protest to said administrator against such&nbsp; sale.&nbsp; Notwithstanding&nbsp; the protest&nbsp; the administrator sold or attempted to sell the&nbsp; land&nbsp; described, including that belonging&nbsp; to the&nbsp; defendant.&nbsp; The defendant is now in possession&nbsp; of the land and has&nbsp; been ever since the execution of the lease in 1903.&nbsp;&nbsp; This action was commenced by the plaintiff to quiet title to the said land and for a mandatory injunction&nbsp; prohibiting the defendant from&nbsp; exercising any rights in relation thereto or of performing any acts in contravention&nbsp; of the&nbsp; rights asserted by the plaintiff.&nbsp;&nbsp; While the prayer for relief does not in terms ask&nbsp; for the delivery of possession of the land and is not the prayer&nbsp; usually found in an action of ejectment to test the title to land&nbsp; and to recover possession&nbsp; thereof, we, notwithstanding, treat it as such, the parties&nbsp; having themselves&nbsp; during the&nbsp; whole course of the&nbsp; proceedings acted upon that theory.<em></em><p>Upon the trial&nbsp; the learned court below found in favor of the plaintiff, declaring that&nbsp; he was&nbsp; the owner of the land,&nbsp; and ordered restitution of&nbsp; possession, the&nbsp; defendant to pay the costs of the action.</p><p>We are of the opinion that the judgment cannot stand upon&nbsp; the facts.&nbsp; ThÂ§ lands of which Matea Rosales died seized are described as&nbsp; measuring 38 meters and 30 centimeters front and 33 meters and 30 centimeters deep.&nbsp; The lands which form&nbsp; the subject matter of the <em>pacto de retro</em> are described as being 30 meters and 48 centimeters front and&nbsp; 30 meters and&nbsp; 88 centimeters deep.&nbsp; It appearing that the lands in dispute in this litigation are located upon the corner of the lot described as 38 meters and 30 centimeters front, and it appearing that said&nbsp; lot so claimed by the defendant&nbsp; would occupy the space which&nbsp; is indicated by the difference between the description of the lot of which Matea died seized&nbsp; and&nbsp; the description of the lot&nbsp; sold by her to the&nbsp; plaintiff under <em>pacto de retro,</em>&nbsp; it is clear&nbsp; to our minds that the change&nbsp; in the&nbsp; description from the original lot to that sold under pacto&nbsp; de retro indicates a clear intention to exclude from the<em> pacto de retro</em> the lot occupied by the defendant as lessee.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, the description in the pacto de retro does not cover the lot in litigation.&nbsp;&nbsp; The plaintiff, relying upon the <em>pacto de retro</em>, must stand&nbsp; or fall&nbsp; by its terms reasonably interpreted.&nbsp; There is no&nbsp; part of the record from which we could draw&nbsp; the inference that Matea Rosales in executing the <em>pacto de retro</em> intended to convey more land than was actually described therein.&nbsp; Neither does it appear from the record that, prior to the&nbsp; dispute which terminated in this litigation, the plaintiff himself was under the impression or had the belief that he&nbsp; had&nbsp; acquired more&nbsp; land than that&nbsp; actually described in the instrument which he&nbsp; accepted.&nbsp; There being, then, nothing&nbsp; in&nbsp; the whole case&nbsp; from which we&nbsp; can adjudge that the intention of the&nbsp; parties was&nbsp; to deal with&nbsp; other or&nbsp; different land than that described&nbsp; by the instrument which&nbsp; they executed, we&nbsp; must construe that instrument according to its terms.&nbsp;&nbsp; By so doing we exclude the transfer of the&nbsp; land in litigation from the terms of said instrument. <br></p><p>It being clear that the sale with the right&nbsp; to repurchase was not&nbsp; intended to include&nbsp; and did&nbsp; not include the piece of land&nbsp; here in litigation, it necessarily follows that&nbsp; the sale by Filomena Rosales to Florencio Noel, the defendant, of said land was a valid sale and conveyed the ownership of said land.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, at the time of the sale by&nbsp; the administrator in the&nbsp; year 1907, the defendant had been&nbsp; the owner&nbsp; and in undisturbed possession of the&nbsp; land&nbsp; in&nbsp; question for&nbsp; more than two years.&nbsp; The&nbsp; sale by the administrator&nbsp; was not really a sale at all but&nbsp; merely an <em>attempt</em> to sell&nbsp; which,&nbsp; for the reasons we have just presented, was wholly futile.&nbsp;&nbsp; The administrator, being powerless to&nbsp; sell the land&nbsp; in dispute, could convey nothing whatever to plaintiff in this case by virtue of said attempt to sell.</p><p>For&nbsp; these reasons we&nbsp; hereby reverse the judgment and dismiss the complaint upon the merits.&nbsp; So ordered.</p><p><em> Arellano, C. J., Mapa, Johnson, Carson,</em> and <em>Trent, JJ</em>., concur.<br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br></p><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="left"><p>&nbsp;</p><p align="center"><em>DISSENTING:</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>TORRES, <em>J., </em></strong></p><p>I am of the opinion that, upon other grounds, the judgment should be&nbsp; affirmed.</p></div>
