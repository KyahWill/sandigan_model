				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The land involved in this case is situate, as stated in the complaint, in the <i>sitio </i>of Guintugan of the municipality of Tuburan, Province of Cebu; it has an  area of  2  <em>cavanes</em>, 10 <em>gantas</em> and 8 <em>chupas</em> of seed corn, and is bounded on the north by the land of Mauricio Esmero, on the east  by that of Francisco Estrella, on the south  by that  of. Mauricio Esmero, and on the west by that of Dionisio Pasigan and Mauricio Esmero.  It is alleged in  the  complaint that the land in question  belongs to  the estate  of the deceased Diego Tabotabo, administered  by the plaintiff, and that the defendant seized  the  said land, without any right or title thereto, and has unlawfully detained the same since the year 1904, profiting  by the product of the 2,686 coconut trees planted thereon, and refused to return the property to the plaintiff, notwithstanding the  reiterated requests so to do which were made upon her; and that the defendant,  by her said unlawful possession, had  caused the aforementioned estate damages  and losses in the amount ot P4,000.  It is therefore,  prayed in the complaint that the defendant be sentenced to restore to the plaintiff, in his capacity  of administrator of the said estate,  the and in dispute, to pay the indemnity mentioned of P4,000, and the costs of the trial.</p>
<p>The defendant, in her answer to the complaint, denied that the  land  in controversy belongs  to the estate of Diego Tabotabo,  or that she had seized the same without having just and legitimate  title thereto, and alleged that  she was then in possession  of only one-half of the said land, inasmuch as the other half had been unlawfully detained by one Jose Veloso, since the year 1909.</p>
<p>It is to be noted that the defendant is the widow of the deceased Diego Tabotabo, by his second marriage,  his first wife  having been one Teodosia Oliva.</p>
<p>During the course of the trial, the defendant presented a motion to the court asking for the dismissal  of the case oh the grounds that, in the special probate proceedings relative to the estate of the deceased Fausto Tabotabo, a son of her husband Diego, she had filed a motion whereby she requested  that various property specified therein  be  adjudicated to her as her share of the property of the conjugal partnership which  existed between herself and the said Diego Tabotabo,  and that, since the land here  in question was a part of that property, any  ruling whatsoever that might be made on the said motion would necessarily affect the rights  in controversy  in the present case.</p>
<p>The court denied the said motion for the dismissal of this case, but,  at the same time, ordered that  the motion presented by the defendant in the special proceedings aforementioned  be made a part of the present trial record.  The hearing of  both cases was, therefore, had at one and the same time and  were jointly decided in the same judgment.</p>
<p>The dispositive part of that judgment is as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>"For all of the foregoing reasons, the court absolves the defendant ftom the complaint and the costs of the trial and orders that a  duplicate of this judgment be attached to the record of the special probate proceedings had in connection with the estate of the deceased Diego Tabotabo, as a ruling on the motion of Gregorio Molero, of the date of June 15, 1908, whereby a separation is requested of one-half of the property above mentioned, and, therefore, it is finally  ordered that one-half of the aforementioned  property be adjudicated in ownership, use, enjoyment and possession, to Gregoria Molero."</p></blockquote>
<p>The plaintiff appealed from that judgment to this court.</p>
<p>After  an examination of the evidence,  we believe  that it is preponderatingly in favor of the plaintiff, in so far as it concerns the land described and claimed in the complaint. The only issue  raised with regard to that  land  is as to whether  it belonged to' the conjugal partnership between the defendant and Diego Tabotabo, or whether it was exclusively owned  by the latter, as contended by the plaintiff. Now, besides the documentary evidence presented by Gaudencio Tabotabo, which  tends to prove that the said  land belonged exclusively to Diego  Tabotabo,  there  is the testimony of the defendant herself that corroborates the fact of such exclusive ownership.  She explicitly and positively testified that the land in dispute was acquired by the latter during his first marriage, although the improvements thereon (the coconut trees) were made during his marriage  with her, the  defendant.  According to  this, the acquisition of the said  land was made prior to the  latter's marriage to Diego  Tabotabo  who, therefore, was the owner of the same and  brought it  to  the  said marriage  as  property  of his own.   This being so, it  is evident  that the said land was the separate and exclusive property  of  Diego Tabotabo, pursuant to article  1396 of the Civil Code, which  provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"Property belonging to each of the spouses.</em></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>"1. That  brought to  the marriage  as his or her  own *    *    *."<br></p></blockquote><p>
  The improvements made on  the said  land,  consisting, as they do, of groves of coconut-trees, also belong by right of accession to  the owner of the  land, that is, to Diego Tabotabo.</p><blockquote>
  <p>"Ownership of property  gives a right by accession to all that is produced thereby or which  is  united to or incorporated therein naturally or artificially."   (Art. 353, Civil Code.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In accordance with this principle, article 358 of the same code expressly declares  thatâ€” </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Whatever is constructed, planted, or sown on another's property,  and the improvements or repairs made thereon, belongs to the owner of the same  *  *  *."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The provision just above quoted has an exception in th$ case of conjugal partnership property, when the same consists of buildings, for the second paragraph.of article 1404 provides that <em>"buildings</em> constructed during the marriage, on land belonging to  one of the spouses, shall also belong to the partnership, but the value of the land shall be paid to the spouse owning  the same."  However, this exception is limited only to buildings and does not  apply to crops, such as are concerned in this case, with respect to which the general rule governs, viz, that what is accessory belongs to what is principal  and  is for the benefit of  the owner of the latter.</p>
<p>The foregoing  statements have reference to the ownership of the actual improvements or crops,  which lies with the owner of the land whereon the latter are, who, in the present case, is  Diego Tabotabo; for, as  regards the disbursements or expenses made to produce the said improvements, such expenditures are of the nature of partnership property and the conjugal partnership must, therefore, be reimbursed for them.   (First paragraph of art. 1404, above cited.)  But, since in the case at bar the sole issue is the ownership of the  land in question  and its improvements, and  the liquidation of  the conjugal partnership between the defendant and Diego Tabotabo is not concerned, there is no  reason for our making any finding whatever  with respect to the said expenses.</p>
<p>Likewise, as the present suit was not brought for the liquidation of the conjugal partnership, it would be improper in this decision to adjudicate  any part whatever of the property held by such partnership, to the defendant as her share of the same, as is done in  the judgment appealed from, with respect to the property  specified in the motion presented by the said defendant in  the special proceedings concerning the estate left by  Fausto Tabotabo, a son of Diego who was the predecessor in interest of the estate represented by the  plaintiff.   It  appears that the trial  judge only took into  account that the property referred to was acquired during the marriage of Diego Tabotabo  with  the defendant.  This fact,  however,  is not sufficient in itself  to determine a priori the real  and actual share of each one of the spouses in the said property, especially as the trial disclosed the probability of the existence of debts which perhaps may affect the property in question. It is  possible that those debts may  be personal ones encumbering Diego Tabotabo's own private property,  and that the conjugal partnership may not be liable for them; but this question can not be incidentally decided here.  The proper  procedure for that purpose would be that whereby a liquidation of the conjugal  partnership would have  to be made and which  might  well  be  the  special proceedings in  the matter of the estate of Diego Tabotabo.  Without there first being a liquidation of the said partnership, which must be made subject to the provisions  of articles 1418 to 1431 of the Civil Code, it can not be known whether or not there  are any net assets or, therefore, any property divisible between the  spouses, as conjugal property,  nor what  is the exact amount of the share that may belong  to each of the latter.  As it does not appear that such a liquidation was effected, it follows that the adjudication in a final manner made in behalf of the defendant, of a certain part of the property declared  to be conjugal property  in the judgment appealed from, is at least premature.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from is set aside,  in so far  as it orders the adjudication to the defendant of one-half  of the said property, as  conjugal partnership property, the right  being reserved to the parties to bring such action or actions, in due legal manner and form, as may be proper  in this matter; and the said judgment is  reversed in the part thereof  which absolves the defendant  from the  complaint, who is hereby sentenced to restore to the plaintiff,  in his capacity of administrator of the estate of Diego Tabotabo, such part of  the land claimed in the complaint as is  in the possession of the said defendant, without obligation on the latter's part, however, to restore the products collected from the said land, which, as a possessor in good faith, she has legitimately acquired.   No special  condemnation is made of the costs of either instance.   So ordered.</p>
