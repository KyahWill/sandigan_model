				G.R. No. 1806, April 22, 1904</h4>
				<H3>SERVILIANO LANZUELA SANTOS, PETITIONER, VS. JOHN C. SWEENEY, RESPONDENT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The attorney for Serviliano Lanzuela Santos has presented a petition in which 
he prays that a writ of prohibition issue, and that this court declare that the 
Hon. John C. Sweeney, judge of the Court of First Instance, exceeded his 
jurisdiction by attempting to compel him to pay Graciana Nemedes alimony in the 
sum of 100 pesos, and: to pay the sum of 50 pesos for the support of each one of 
her two children, which sums are to be paid monthly in1 advance within the first 
five days of each month, and furtli0r to pay the sum of $200 to the attorney for 
the plaintiff as part payment of his fees.
<p>Attorney G. E. Campbell appeared for the respondent, and on the 15th instant 
filed an answer in which he states that the petition of the woman in question is 
based upon one of the grounds which authorize the allowance of alimony pendente 
lite; that all the money to be paid to the woman has been earned by her; that 
the money to be paid for the support of her daughters is to keep alive the flesh 
and blood of the petitioner himself, and. that with respect to the payment of 
attorney's fees, the purpose is to enable the wife and children to obtain their 
rights, and that he confides in the great wisdom and mature judgment of this 
court in the determination of the case.</p>
<p>The court below ordered the petitioner to pay alimony during the pendency of 
the divorce suit on trial in the court. This fact presupposes that the parties 
are married.</p>
<p>Article 68 of the Civil Code provides that after a complaint for divorce has 
been filed and admitted, certain action is to be taken by the court, including 
the allowance of alimony for the woman and such of the children as are not in 
the possession of the father. Upon this provision of the law the judge directed 
the payment of alimony for the support of the children and their mother, and 
also the payment of suit money, chargeable to the conjugal partnership. 
Consequently the relief prayed for can not be granted.</p>
<p>The petition is dismissed and the writ of prohibition denied, with the costs 
against the petitioner.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Mapa, McDonough,</em> and <em>Johnson, JJ.,</em> 
concur.</p>
