				G.R. No. 9116, September 19, 1914</h4>
				<H3>ROSENDO PALAD ET AL., PETITIONERS, VS. MARIANO CUI, AS JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF THE PROVINCE OF TAYABAS, AND BALDOMERO CALATRAVA, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MORELAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In this proceeding it is prayed that a writ of mandamus issue directing the 
respondent Mariano Cui, as judge of the Court of First Instance of the Province 
of Tayabas, to approve a proposed bill of exceptions in civil case No. 600 of 
that court, and thereby allow an appeal to the Supreme Court for a review of the 
judgment, orders, and decrees of the court in that action.
<p>The complaint also prays, that this court, if it find an appeal from the 
judgment, orders, and decrees aforesaid will, not lie, issue a writ of 
certiorari, directed to the judge aforesaid to certify to this court a complete 
transcript of the record of the court in the cause, so that the acts of the 
court may be reviewed and their legality determined as provided by law; and that 
the orders and decrees specified therein be declared null and void as having 
been made without or in excess of jurisdiction.</p>
<p>It appears undisputed that on the 10th of January, 1911, Baldomero Calatrava 
began an action against the plaintiffs in this case for the summary possession 
of real estate in the justice's court of Sariaya, Tayabas, of which lands, it 
was alleged, defendants in that case had deprived the plaintiff by one of the 
means described in section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The action was 
tried and decision rendered by the justice's court in favor of the plaintiff and 
possession of the lands was duly awarded. The defendants appealed to the Court 
of First Instance.</p>
<p>After the perfection of the appeal the plaintiff Calatrava reproduced in the 
Court of First Instance the complaint which he had filed in the justice's court, 
which, after having been amended in some particulars unimportant here, was 
received by that court as the complaint in the case.</p>
<p>On the 16th day of October, 1911, Calatrava, the plaintiff, was notified by 
the clerk of the court that the case had been put on the calendar for trial on 
the 2d day of November, 1911. There appears in the record a certificate of such 
service signed by the clerk in the following form:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This 16th day of October, 1911, notices were sent by mail to Baldomero 
Calatrava and Rosendo Palad at Sariaya, notifying them that the present case was 
set down on the calendar of the court for the 2d day of November, 
1911."</p></blockquote>
<p>On the 28th day of October, 1911, the defendants filed a demurrer to the 
complaint. It does not appear that a copy of this demurrer was served upon the 
attorney for the plaintiff or upon the plaintiff himself.</p>
<p>On the 2d of November the case was duly called for a hearing upon the 
demurrer and the latter having been considered by the court was sustained and 
the complaint dismissed. On the same day notice of the decision was sent by the 
clerk of the court to the plaintiff, Calatrava, service of which is certified by 
the clerk by the following added to the bottom of the order sustaining the 
demurrer and dismissing the complaint:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This 2d day of November, 1911, a copy of the foregoing order was sent to 
plaintiff at Sariaya."</p></blockquote>
<p>On the 30th of November, 1912, more than one year after the rendition of the 
judgment and notice of the same as aforesaid, said Court of First Instance, but 
with a different judge presiding, set aside the order sustaining the demurrer 
and dismissing the complaint and reinstated the cause, basing its action upon 
the ground that the order sustaining the demurrer had been made and the cause 
dismissed without notice to the plaintiff. This order of the court seems to have 
been notified to both parties in the case, for, later, we see the defendants in 
pursuance thereof answering the complaint without objection and proceeding with 
the preparation of the cause for trial. Issue was later duly joined and the 
cause tried, the court rendering judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against 
the defendants.</p>
<p>Portions of the judgment of the court material to the questions before us are 
as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The court finds and decides that the plaintiff is the sole owner and 
legitimate possessor of the lands in question, with a perfect right to the 
possession of the same and that the defendants have been unjustly detaining the 
said lands since the 3d day of January, 1911.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<p>"That the defendants, their agents and servants, are for ever prohibited from 
interfering in any manner whatever with the plaintiff in the possession of said 
lands.</p></blockquote>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The right is reserved to the plaintiff of bringing an action against the 
defendants for the recovery of the value of the product of said lands and 
damages resulting from the detention thereof."</p></blockquote>
<p>We are of the opinion that mandamus will not lie. The action in the justice's 
court was one merely for the summary recovery of the possession of land and had 
nothing to do directly with the determination of the ownership thereof</p>
<p>The case was appealed to the Court of First Instance and was tried upon the 
same theory. It has been held by this court, the writer of this opinion 
dissenting, that a third instance, that is, an appeal to the Supreme Court, does 
not lie in summary proceedings.</p>
<p>That being1 so, no appeal lies in this case from the judgment of the Court of 
First Instance, and, accordingly, the petition for the writ ordering that an 
appeal be allowed must be denied.</p>
<p>We are also of the opinion that the petitioners are not entitled to the writ 
of certiorari as prayed for. We regard the action of the Court of First Instance 
vacating the order sustaining the demurrer and dismissing the action as within 
its jurisdiction. If the notice of the hearing of the cause on the 2d of 
November, 1911, had been given as required by law our judgment would have been 
different. In such case the order would have become final long before the order 
vacating it was made and the court would have been without jurisdiction in the 
premises upon the showing made.</p>
<p>As will be observed, however, the notice was given by the clerk to the 
plaintiff in the case and not to his attorney.</p>
<p>The plaintiff had appeared in the justice's court by E. A. Gala, an attorney 
and counselor at law of Lucena, Tayabas, and had also appeared in the Court of 
First Instance on appeal by the same attorney, who signed the complaint. It is 
the general rule that where a party appears by attorney in an action or 
proceeding in a court of record, all notices thereafter required to be given in 
the action or proceeding must be given to the attorney and not the client; and 
that a notice given to the client and not to his attorney is not a notice in 
law. (Rules 3 and 12, Courts of First Instance.) As a necessary consequence, the 
demurrer was sustained and the action was dismissed without legal notice to the 
party interested. This being the case, the plaintiff could apply within a 
reasonable time after discovering the dismissal of his action for the vacation 
of the dismissing order and the reinstatement of the cause. This was in fact 
done soon after the discovery, and we are of the opinion that the court had 
jurisdiction to make the order which it made.</p>
<p>There appear to be, however, certain references in the judgment of the court 
which seem to decide the question of ownership and which seem also to have been 
made upon the theory that the ownership of the property in question was 
necessarily determined by that judgment. We have already quoted those parts of 
the decision which seem to do this. In so far as they in any way affect the 
title to the land in question, they are beyond the jurisdiction of the court to 
make and must be held to be void.</p>
<p>It is a principle established by decisions of this court that, on an appeal 
In summary proceedings, the Court of First Instance has no wider jurisdiction or 
greater powers than had the justice's court from which the appeal was taken. A 
justice of the peace having in summary proceedings no jurisdiction to determine 
the title to land, the Court of First Instance has no such power on an 
appeal.</p>
<p>The petition for mandamus is, therefore, denied, as is also the petition for 
a writ of certiorari except as herein above stated, with costs.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson, Carson,</em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.,</em> 
concur.<br></p>
