				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE, VS. JUAN BABASA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.

				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Juan  Babasa, late on  the  night of January 27, 1899, went to the house  of  Maria  Antolin and called to the latter's daughter, Fausta, telling her to come out.   Fausta, Maria, and a little boy, the latter's son, came out to see who was calling.   No sooner had Fausta, who went ahead, arrived  at, the door of the house than she received a wound in the abdomen, from which she died on the following day. This is the statement of the mother and of the boy, Julio Bauan.</p>
<p>The death was discovered by  a police officer named Mamerto Gabot,   He testified that, having asked the mother what had caused the death of the deceased, she replied that the girl had died of a stomach ache, but he,  suspecting that it was the result of  a crime, sent for a doctor to examine the body; that the doctor found  the wound in the abdomen, and stated that the girl, who was some 16 years of age, had died from its  effects.  The mother, nevertheless, testified that some two days  before Babasa  had  been making love to her daughter, who did not respond to his advances,  as he was a married man, and that on  the night in question the facts occurred as above stated.   Maria  Antolin, in her testimony, says: "Upon stepping outside,  Fausta asked him, 'What do you want of me?' and Juan, without saying anything, stabbed my daughter."  The girl then, feeling that she was wounded, sat down on the; second step of the stairway and from there  was carried bv her mother  into the house.</p>
<p>The accused testified that he was drunk and did not know what he had done; that he had had no  intention  of doing anything of the kind, and that  on this account the family had promised not to make  any complaint about the occurrence, they being convinced that he. had not intended to inflict the wound, which was simply the unfortunate result of a movement of  his hand.  The entire defense  has  consisted in showing that the accused maintained  amorous relations with the deceased, to which several witnesses have testified.</p>
<p>The judge, considering present the aggravating circumstances of nocturnity, abuse of superiority, and the commission  of the offense in the  dwelling house of the deceased, and the specific circumstances of premeditation and treachery (<em>alevosia</em>),  condemned the accused to death.</p>
<p>We can not consider that the  specific circumstance of premeditation is present, because there is no evidence indicating reflection,  which is required  for this  circumstance.  We consider the specific circumstance of treachery (<em>alevosia</em>)  to be present, because1 of the means employed by the defendant in the commission of the crime, which was held to constitute alevoma  by the  supreme court of Spain in its judgment of July 14, 1870.  This circumstance being present, it becomes unnecessary to consider the aggravating circumstance of abuse of  superiority and nocturnity.   Neither is there  any  necessity for considering the circumstance  of the commission of the offense in a dwelling house, as this fact does not appear to be proven by the testimony of Maria  Antolin.</p>
<p>Therefore,  there  being  no aggravating  or  mitigating circumstances, the specific  crime of murder must be punished by  the  medium degree of  the penalty fixed by  the law.   By virtue thereof we decide that Juan Babasa must be condemned to life  imprisonment  (<em>cadena perpetua</em>) with the legal  accessories,  to  the  payment of 1,000 Mex- ican pesos to the nearest relatives of the deceased, and to pay the costs of both instances.</p>
<p><em> Torres, Cooper, Willard, Mapa,</em> and <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
