<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>TRENT, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This action was brought on April  12,  1911,  by  Rafael, Antonio,  Trinidad,  Cayetano, Rosario,  Gertrudis, and Carmen  Enriquez, and Antonio Gascon   (the latter being a minor, was represented by his guardian ad litem), as owners and lessors of the property  Nos. 72, 74, and 76 Escolta,  city of Manila,  against A.  S.  Watson  &amp;  Company, Ltd., as lessee of said property.  The plaintiffs allege that on June 22, 1906,  Rafael, Carmen, Antonio, and Trinidad Enriquez and Antonio Gascon executed to the defendant a contract of mortgage and lease upon their participation  in  that property; that on January 19, 1907, the other plaintiffs executed    the  same mortgage and  lease in favor of the  defendant upon their interest in the same property;  that the said contract of lease has been terminated by  the  payment by the plaintiffs to the defendant of the principal  and interest of the mortgage; that the said contract of  lease is null and of no effect by reason of the  minority  of the plaintiff Antonio Gascon, who is still a minor; that the defendant, after June 22, 1906, made all the repairs  necessary  to its business with the approval of the plaintiffs.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs further  allege that there exists  in that building a principal wall about one meter  in thickness and five  meters in height, which extends from  the  front of the building on the  Escolta to the rear of the  same; that upon this  wall rests the  second floor of the building and that it is necessary to safely maintain the building against earthquakes and typhoons; that on the 11th of  April, 1911, the defendant commenced to destroy and remove the said wall and  was on the  date of the filing of this complaint actually engaged in the destruction and  removal of the same; and unless restrained,  would continue  such   destruction and removal, to the irreparable injury  of the plaintiffs; and that the defendant has varied the form and substance of the leased premises.  The plaintiffs  therefore prayed that the defendant be prohibited from destroying and removing said  wall; that it be ordered to rebuild or replace that part which it had removed or  destroyed; and that the contract of lease be declared terminated and rescinded.</p>
<p>On the 12th day of April, 1911, a preliminary injunction was issued by the Court of First Instance,  prohibiting and restraining the defendant  from continuing  the removal and destruction of the  wall in  question, and  requiring  it to appear in court  on the  17th of that month,to  show cause why  such preliminary  injunction should not be continued in force during the pendency of this action.</p>
<p>On the 21st  of  that month,  the defendant company answered, admitting the allegations as to the ownership, mortgage, and lease, contained in paragraphs  1, 2, and 3 of the  complaint,  and denying  all the  other  allegations therein.  The defendant set  up by way of special defense that the wall in question was not a principal wall and did not extend the entire length of the building; that  said wall consisted of two shells filled with mortar;  that it  was very old, deteriorated, and weak; that it was necessary, in order to conserve the  property, to  remove said wall and to substitute it with other material; that the wall in question is so located that it and its subtenant are deprived of the use of a large part of the ground floor fronting on the Escolta; that under Clause M of the contract of lease, the defendant has  the right  to  remove  this wall,  substituting in lieu thereof other material, this being required by the business established in said  building.</p>
<p>As a second special defense, the defendant admits the payment of the mortgage by  the plaintiffs, but alleges that the contract of lease is independent of the mortgage contract, and that in satisfying the mortgage of the defendant, the leasehold  was  specifically continued  in  force  by all parties.</p>
<p>As a  third special  defense, the defendant alleges that under  the  provisions of Paragraph M of the contract of lease, it has expended the sum of over sixty thousand pesos in improving the leased premises, and that on making such expenditure it believed that  it would be  reimbursed by enjoying the occupancy and subrenting of the premises.</p>
<p>On the 24th day of May, 1911, the Philippines  Drug Company, a corporation organized under  the laws of the Philippine  Islands,  appeared  and asked leave to intervene as an interested party.  This leave being granted, it alleged that it is the actual owner of the pharmacy situated in the leased premises, which formerly belonged to the defendant A. S. Watson &amp; Company, Ltd.;  and that the defendant sublet to it the ground floor of the leased property under the same conditions  as are expressed in the original contract of lease.  The intervener further alleged, as did the defendant,  the  necessity for the removal  of the wall in question in order to give it more space as required by its  business, and that the removal of this wall was authorized in Paragraph M of the original lease.</p>
<p>The trial court, after considering the evidence presented, making  a  personal inspection  of the leased  premises, and hearing the arguments of counsel for both parties, and after making its findings of facts and conclusions of law, entered the following decree, to wit:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The court denies the rescission and declaration of nullity  of the contract of lease demanded  by  the  plaintiffs, declaring such contract of lease to be valid and subsisting and binding upon the parties thereto, and upon the  sub-lessee and intervener, the Philippines Drug Company, and continues and declares final the preliminary writ of injunction issued herein on the 12th day of April, 1911, but modifying the  same by permitting the defendant, A. S. Watson &amp; Co. Ltd., or the intervener, the Philippines Drug Company, to remove the wall  in question on  the condition  that they substitute it with properly constructed concrete pillars and arches and such other  work as may  be  necessary as specified in Finding No. 17 of this judgment using such temporary shoring and bracing as shall be necessary to insure the safety  of the building while such change is being made,  which work of  removal and  substitution may be commenced and carried out upon the defendant or intervener, or both,  filing  herein  an undertaking in the  sum of P10,000 with sureties approved by the court, conditioned that it or they will reimburse the plaintiff lessors for any and all damage that may be caused the leased premises by a failure to take proper precautions and employ proper means to safeguard and protect  the building while  such work of removal and substitution is being accomplished."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this judgment the plaintiffs appealed  and make the following assignment  of errors:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"1. The  judgment is erroneous in not having declared rescinded the contract of lease.</p>
  <p>"2. The judgment is erroneous in finding that the lessee and sublessee have the right to change the form and substance of the property leased.</p>
  <p>"3.  The judgment is erroneous in finding that the lessee acted in good faith in beginning the destruction of the wall. believing that under the contract of lease it had the right to do this.</p>
  <p>"4.  The judgment  is erroneous  in not  finding that  the building is weakened by the destruction of the wall.</p>
  <p>"5.  The judgment is erroneous is so far as it modifies the preliminary injunction.</p>
  <p>"6.  The judgment is erroneous in  not declaring perpetual the preliminary injunction.</p>
  <p>"7.  The judgment  is erroneous  in the  dispositive part thereof relating  to the form and  manner of making  the modifications in  the  property because it  does  not  relate to anything  at issue in the case.</p>
  <p>"8.  The judgment  is erroneous  in the  part relating to the form and manner of making the modifications  in  the property because it does not dispose of  anything judicially, but, on  the  contrary,  gives  permission  to  the opposing parties without commanding them  to do anything.</p>
  <p>"9.  The judgment is erroneous because it does not order the repair of the destruction made  in the wall.</p>
  <p>"10. The judgment is erroneous because it declares valid the contract  of lease.</p>
  <p>"11. The court erred in denying the motion for  a new trial."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All questions in this case may be merged into one, and that is:  Did the trial court err in failing to declare the contract of  lease voidable  or rescinded  for  one of two reasons: first, because of the minority of one of the lessors; and second, because neither the  defendant nor intervener had authority under the contract of lease to remove the wall in question?  Plaintiffs  do not  now insist that the contract  of lease was  terminated on the payment of the mortgage.</p>
<p>The eight  plaintiffs each have a one-eighth  undivided interest in the leased  premises.   The property was  leased to the defendant for a period of twelve years with permission to renew the lease for  a  further period of  six  years.  Seven of these plaintiffs were of age when they executed this contract of lease.   The other, Antonio, Gascon, was a minor.  At the time this contract  of lease was executed, the minor was represented by his judicial guardian.  The guardian having obtained  authority  or permission of the court to enter into this contract of  lease for and on behalf  of  his ward, the action of the guardian  in executing said  contract  was approved  by the probate court.</p>
<p>Article 1548 of the Civil Code reads :</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"ART. 1548. The husband can not give in lease the property  of  the wife, the father and guardian, that of  the son or minor, and the  administrator of  property, not having a special power, for a period exceeding six years."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Article 398  of the same code provides:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Art. 398.  The decision of  a majority of the co-owners as to the management and better enjoyment  of the thing owned in common shall  be obligatory.</p>
  <p>"There shall be no majority, unless the resolution has been adopted  by the co-owners representing a majority of the interests which constitute the object of the community.</p>
  <p>"Should  there be no  majority, or  the resolution of the latter is seriously prejudicial to  the  parties interested in the thing owned in common, the judge, at the instance of a party, shall decree what may  be proper,  including the appointment of an administrator."</p>
  <p align="center">*       *       *        *       *      *       *</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Counsel for the plaintiffs do not claim that the contract of lease which was made  for a  period  of more than six years is seriously prejudicial to the interests of the minor, nor do  they claim that said  contract, of itself, prejudices in any way the minor's interest.</p>
<p>The supreme court  of Spain  had  under  consideration this very question in its resolution of April 26, 1907 (vol. 15 Jurisprudencia referente  al Codigo Civil, p. 194).  In this  case, a contract of lease for twelve  years, executed by one of the co-owners of a certain property, one of whom was  a minor, had been  presented for registry.  Registry was, refused for the reason, among others, that the majority of the co-owners lacked authority  to execute said contract of lease.  It was argued that  the majority of the co-owners, in their enjoyment of the control of the management and  administration  of the thing, acted in a representative or an administrative capacity in regard to the minority.  In determining the questions presented in this case, the court said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"That for the administration and  better enjoyment of the  thing, the decision of the majority of the co-owners is obligatory, and that there  is no majority,  unless the decision is made by the co-owners, that  represent the majority of the  interests that constitute the object of the community, are general rules  laid down in article  398 of the Civil Code, governing community of property.</p>
  <p>"The contract of lease  is by its  nature  and  purpose one  of  the means  of  enjoyment or development  of  non-fungible property, and, in  this concept,  may  be  agreed upon by the co-owners of  a thing, provided always  that they represent a majority of the interests of the community, the  decision being obligatory  for  all by virtue  of  the powers that are expressly  conferred upon them by virtue of said provisions.</p>
  <p>"If,  indeed, the  contract of lease of real  property  for a  period exceeding six years,  or in which the rents  are advanced  for more than  three years, constitutes  a  real right inasmuch as it  is subject to  registry,  according to the decision of this court in  various resolutions, this principle of law, which has been applied  in the  sense, of not permitting, the execution of  such a  contract to  those  who administer the goods of others, and especially  to  prevent agents  from executing such a contract without  special authority for the same, in  accordance  with the  provisions of article  1713 of the said code,  is  not  opposed  to the principle of  law laid down in  said  article  398;  taking into  consideration the legal  character and peculiar attributes of community of property, which makes it  convenient and  necessary that those  who have less interest  therein should submit to those who have a greater participation   therein, in all that refers to the exploitation and ordinary enjoyment of the  same, the rule is  established that the enjoyment of the  common thing must be subject to the will  of the  majority, without distinguishing and  limiting the period or  the form of the enjoyment; therefore, the contract of lease  being the same in essence whatever the term for  which it is constituted, such a contract must be considered as an act of mere administration, and subject to  contract by the decision  of the  majority of coowners, the other interested  parties  always having the right to appeal  to the  court  when  the  decision is  gravely prejudicial to them according to the provisions  of the same article 398.</p>
  <p>"This doctrine was recognized by the supreme court in its decision of June 30, 1897, and of the 8th of July, 1902, and by this court in its resolution of May 29, 1906, considering as  included in the powers conferred in  said article, leases exceeding a period of six years, decided upon by a  majority of  the co-owners  of a  property possessed in common.</p>
  <p>"The  contract of lease of  the  property referred  to in these proceedings, having been agreed upon by the co-owners representing the majority of the interests in the  same, they were possessed of sufficient  legal capacity by virtue of  what is  already said, and it is, therefore, subject to registry."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the execution of the contract of lease under consideration, the minor was, as we have said, represented by his judicial  guardian, who not only asked the court for and obtained authority to  execute this contract  of lease on behalf of his  ward, but his act, after the execution, was approved by the court.  The interest of the minor has  not been prejudiced by reason of the fact that this contract of lease was  executed  for a term  of more than six years. Under the doctrine laid down by  the  supreme court of Spain, it would appear that this  contract of  lease would be  valid if the minor had not been represented by  his guardian.  The minor  having  been represented by his duly appointed guardian, there can be  no question about the validity of this contract of lease.</p>
<p>The principal question  is whether or not the appellees have violated the terms of the contract of lease and thereby entitle the  appellants to have  said  contract of  lease rescinded.</p>
<p>Before  considering the contract  in  question, it  might be well to examine the right of the  lessee to make changes in the property leased, if there were no express stipulation therefor in the contract.</p>
<p>Article  1573  of the Civil Code provides:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"A  lessee  shall have, with regard to the  useful and voluntary improvements, the same rights  which are granted the usufructuary."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Article  487 of the same code reads:</p>
<blockquote>"The usufructuary may make on the property which is the object of the usufruct any improvements, useful or for recreation, which he may deem proper,  provided he does not change its  form or substance;   but  he  shall have no right  to be  indemnified therefor.   He may,  however, remove  said improvements, should  it be possible to do so without injury to the property."</blockquote>The result is that the  lessee may make  any improvements, useful or for recreation,  in the property leased that he may deem proper, provided that  he does not change its form  or substance.  The same  obligation is  expressed in articles 487 and 489, and in so far as the form of the thing is concerned, in article 1557.  According to articles 487 and 3557, the obligations of the lessee and the lessor are the same in the absence of any agreement to the contrary, in so far as the conservation of the form  of the thing leased is concerned.  This question of conserving the form and substance of the thing leased or the object of the usufruct has been passed upon at various times by the courts.
<p>In the case of the Manila Building and Loan Association and Peñalosa (13 Phil. Rep., 575), this court said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"If the object leased were a house, it is evident that the lessee might effect such improvements for use, recreation or            comfort as would not change its form or substance  as he deemed fit; he could build a tower or luxurious pavilion more expensive than the house itself, to which, at the expiration of the lease,  the owner of the house would have no right whatever, unless the lessee could not remove the same without injury to the house to which it was attached  as an improvement, excepting of course the right to cause the same to be demolished so that the house might be returned to him in the same condition that the lessee received it;   *   *  *."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The supreme court of Spain, in its judgment of June 24, 1905,  volume 14 of the Jurisprudencia  referente  al Codigo Civil, page 38, had  under consideration the interpretation of this phrase in a case in which the  lessee asked for the rescission of the lease  because  the  lessor had altered the form  of the thing leased.  The facts were that  the lessee had leased the house for the period of ten years, and at the time of the execution of the contract of lease, there was a vacant lot next  to the house and 13 windows  of  the house leased overlooked this  lot.   Thereafter the owner of the adjacent lot constructed an edifice thereon which gave rise to litigation between the lessor and the owner of the adjacent lot, which litigation was settled by the lessor and the owner of  the said lot, the latter being permitted to  cover the windows of the leased property, and the former allowed to open  in the  partition wall  of the  latter's  garden two large and two small windows of specified dimensions, under certain conditions.   The construction was continued, with the result that such  construction  effectually closed and covered the  13  windows and  the  balcony, depriving the property leased of the light previously received by the same. For the purpose of obtaining  better light, many changes were  made and much  work done in  the interior of the leased house, the final result being that some of the rooms of the house were darkened completely, others receiving poor and indirect ventilation.  The court, in refusing to rescind the contract of lease, said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"It  does not appear that there is error committed by the trial court in its decision as set out in the first assignment of error, because, even though the noncompliance by the lessor of his obligations, among which was that of maintaining the lessee in the peaceable enjoyment of the lease during the period of the contract,  and the prohibition to change the form of the thing leased, confers upon the lessee the right to ask for the rescission of the contract, such circumstances are not found in the present case since the trial court says that the appellant was not disturbed in the possession of the house, the  object of the lease,  nor was he impeded from using the  premises  as  a tavern, for which  use he had intended the same,  and these  findings  of fact  have not been legally  impugned.</p>
  <p>"The decision  also states that the changes made  in the property did not change the form of the same in the sense and concept covered by article 1557 of the Civil Code.  Notwithstanding that the findings  on the point contain legal reasoning now corresponding to  this  court, the interpretation of this article can not be made in general and absolute terms not defined by law, because as a circumstantial fact depending in each case on the peculiar conditions of the thing leased, there exists no reason in the case at bar upon which to base the conclusion that the trial court erred, having in mind that the particular use of the same as a tavern was not interfered with, as held in its  decision, and also the fact set out in its decision,  and not contradicted in any manner, namely, that the changes and alterations made were  beneficial, tolerated by Sabay, and consented to by the person to whom Sabay  transferred his  rights under the contract of sublease.</p>
  <p>"The last two reasons given for the  rescission of the contract lack force and weight, because, in accordance with the sense and concept of article 1561 of the said Civil Code, the property must be returned at the expiration of the term of lease with the changes made in the  same, and these do not involve, as has  already been said, any variation or change of form or any interruption of the peaceable enjoyment of the lease and because it does not appear from the facts that the trial court accepted as proven that the  appellant suffered disturbance of his rights for which he had been compelled to become responsible to the lessor, and he,  not having done so, there is no legal reason to apply, as is attempted, the provisions of article 1560 of the code referred to."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Manresa, in volume 10 of his commentaries on the Civil Code, pages 534, 535, [488,  489] says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The question was discussed very energetically as to whether the lessee of a city property leased for a stated industrial purpose,&nbsp; could install machinery propelled by steam in substitution for the utilities, implements, and contrivances which were used  before  the  general  adoption of such machinery.  The installation of  modern machinery  and its ordinary operation, at once caused a deterioration to the estate much greater than the  use of the former apparatus, besides the accidents which might occur and which produce very great damage to the thing leased. Therefore, based upon this consideration, it  was said that the  lessee  could not make this  substitution because it implied a bad and prejudicial use of the thing and therefore very different from that diligence of a  good father  in its use to  which he had obligated himself.</p>
  <p>"As Laurent says, there arise here two contrary interests and two diverse tendencies.  The owner has  in view  the stability of the structure and  fears every innovation which may compromise its preservation.   The manufacturer finds himself obliged  to keep abreast of the development  of his industry, to make changes, if he does not wish to perish, and his interests demand that he  put into practice the inventions which increase his profits, even though the edifice may suffer.  The owner conmmences  to resist,  adds this writer,  but  competition forces the manufacturer, and  the owner ends by yielding, if he does not wish to remain  unproductive.</p>
  <p>"This is the essence of the policy pursued by foreign decisions, where  the question has been so much more important than in our own country.  Until the year 1860, judicial decisions were inclined  to favor the owner of the property. But from that year the rights of industry have been  recognized with ever increasing clearness.  It has been considered that from the  moment the lease is drawn up, in which is stated the industrial use to which the lessee desires to put the thing leased, the claims of the industry to which the object of the lease is to be devoted have been determined, and the lessee can not be condemned to a stagnation which would be uneconomical, and, these facts admitted, the logical consequences must necessarily follow:  the lessor can not prevent the lessee from adopting the improvements of his industry; the acts of the parties in making the stipulations in the lease will do the rest."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The lessee may make on the property which is the object of the lease any  improvements, useful or  for  recreation, which he may deem proper, provided he does not change its form or substance. He is obligated to use the thing leased as a  diligent father of a family would, and to return the thing leased at the expiration of the lease in the same condition in which he received it, except what  may have  been destroyed  or  impaired by time or unavoidable  reasons. (Arts. 1573, 487, 1555,  and 1561, Civil Code.)</p>
<p>The supreme court of Spain recognizes the fact that  no ironclad  rules for the interpretation of these articles can be laid down which would govern all cases.   These provisions must be applied according to the facts and circumstances of  each case.  Manresa is inclined to the view that industrial development should be taken into consideration in the determination of questions involved in the  application of said articles.   The provisions of  these articles  are  general rules of law,  and,  like most general  propositions, are not to be accepted without limitation or reserve, under any and all circumstances.  They  must be interpreted  in the light  of the growth of civilization and varying  conditions. Certain obligations are placed upon the lessee  to prevent lawless acts which would  result in waste or destruction. The importance of these obligations to the lessor cannot  be denied. Especially are they valuable and  essential to the          protection of a landlord who rents his premises for a short time.  Suppose he has fitted his premises for certain uses and leases them for such uses for a short term.  He would then be entitled to receive them back at the end of the term still fitted for  those same uses, and he may well say that he does not  choose to have a different property returned to him from that which he  leased, even if it be found to be of greater value by  reason  of the  change. But suppose that a usufructuary who has  a life interest  in an estate should receive as such a hemp hacienda, and that in a short time this hacienda should become permanently unproductive through disease or death of the plants, or by change of the market conditions, and the  land to have become  far more valuable,  by reason of new conditions, as rice  or sugar land.  Is  the usufructuary to be compelled  to preserve or renew the useless hemp fields and forego  the advantages to be  derived  from a different use?  Or,  suppose a  life tenant should change warehouses  into dwelling houses on the ground  that  by  change of conditions the demand for warehouses had ceased and the property had become worthless, whereas  it  would be very valuable when  fitted  for dwelling houses.  Would this be such a change in the form or substance of the thing leased as to forfeit the interest of the  tenant?  Again,  a lessee for a <em>long</em>  term  received, during very prosperous times, a hemp hacienda upon which were constructed large and  valuable storehouses  in which were the old style hand-presses, but new.  Later, on account of a complete change in conditions due to the market and the method of  pressing hemp by steam, the lessee allowed the buildings and presses,  which had become useless, to fall into decay rather than incur the expense of repair.  Would a prudent owner  of the fee, if in possession, have done the same ?  These questions naturally suggest their own answer. The  radical  and permanent changes of surrounding conditions  must always be an important consideration  in  the determination  of such questions.   The interpretation that "if  the man is too long  for  the bed his head should be chopped off rather than enlarge the  old bed  or  purchase a new one" should not be given those provisions of the Civil Code regarding the obligations of lessees.</p>
<p>Let us now turn to the contract of lease and the evidence presented.  In this contract of lease there are two clauses which deserve careful consideration.</p>
<p>Clause K:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"All the expenditures  for cleaning, painting, and repairs which the building may require and all that is ordered done by the Board of Health, will be at the expense of the lessee, A. S.  Watson  and Company, Limited.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clause M:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The lessee may make such works on the building as the business which it has established therein requires,  provided always that neither the  strength nor the value of the said building is impaired."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be noted that the word "reparaciones" is used in Clause K, and  the word "obras" in Clause M.  Counsel 'for the appellants  insist that the word "obras" as thus used means the same as  "reparaciones."  The Encyclopedic Dictionary of  the Castilian Language  (Diccionario  Enciclopedico de la Lengua Castellana)  defines these words as follows :</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left">"OBRA:</p>
  <p>"1. A thing  made or produced by  an agent.</p>
  <p align="center">*       *      *       *       *       *       *</p>
  <p>"4. A building in course of construction.</p>
  <p>"REPARACION:</p>
  <p>"1. The  action and effect of repair.  (<em>Reparar</em>—verb: To mend, to straighten, or to correct the damage  suffered by something.)"</p>
  <p>The  New Dictionary of the Castilian Language (Nuevo Diccionario  de la  Lengua Castellana)  defines the same words  as follows:</p>
  <p>"OBRA:</p>
  <p>"Anything made, created,  or  produced by some power or agent.  Any construction  of  architecture, masonry,  or carpentry, applied especially to buildings in course of construction  or repair,  as:  There are  three  jobs  in Calle Hortaleza.  Everything in,my house is disordered and topsyturvy because of the work.' </p>
  <p>"REPARACION :</p>
  <p>"The act or effect of  repairing  or of being repaired. The fact of repairing, in the sense of renewing or improving something."</p>
  <p>The only synonym given in this work for "obra" is "produccion."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It may  be that  repairs  are included in the definition  of "obras."  Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that the word "obras," used in its general sense, has a far  more comprehensive meaning  than just  simple repairs.</p>
<p>Sections 290 and 293 of  the  Code  of Civil  Procedure, provide:</p>

  <p>"SEC. 290. <em>Terms of a  writing presumed to be in their ordinary sense</em>.—The terms  of a writing are presumed  to have  been used in  their primary and  general acceptation, but evidence is nevertheless admissible  that  they  have a local, technical or otherwise peculiar signification, and were so used and understood in the particular  instance, in which case the agreement must  be construed accordingly."</p>

</blockquote>
<p>In  the case at bar  no proof has been  presented tending to show that the word "obras" was  used in a technical  or special sense, or that  it has a local signification, and therefore,  it must be  considered as used in its  ordinary and general sense.  If  there exists any  ambiguity  and  if the meaning that the  appellants give to the word  "obras"  is proper, the meaning given by  the appellees is likewise proper, consequently, we must apply the rule laid down  in section 293, above quoted, for the reason that the  stipulation contained in Clause M of the contract is a stipulation in favor of the lessee.</p>
<p>Counsel for appellants insist that in order to define the meaning of the word "obras" we should refer  to the articles of the Civil Code that deal with contracts of lease.  This might be  done  in  those  cases where the intention of the parties could not be ascertained  from either the  contract itself or from the  conduct of the parties in executing and carrying out the same.   In the case at bar, all that is necessary  is to give a fair and reasonable interpretation to the meaning of Clause M of the contract of lease.  This clause contains certain limitations  on the exercise of the right  to make alterations  (obras) :  first, the alterations  (obras) proposed  to be  made must  be required by  the business; second, such alterations must not injure the solidity of the building;  and third, the same must not prejudice the value of the building.  But it is  insisted, as we  have said, that the word "obras" in Clause M must be interpreted to mean "reparaciones" as used in Clause K. , Clause K imposes upon the lessee the obligation to make the repairs required by the building for its conservation.   If the words have  exactly the same meaning and were intended by the parties to mean the same thing,  then the insertion of Clause M would only have  had the effect of giving to the lessee the right to keep the building in repair, when, as a matter of fact. Clause  K made it its duty to repair the building.  As we understand the contract, in Clause K a duty is imposed upon the lessee, while in Clause  M a right is given to it.  In  Clause K the word  "reparaciones" is used in connection with the duty, and in Clause M the word  "obras" is used in connection with  the  right.   If the contracting parties  had intended that the two words be used  in the same  sense they would have  so stated,  or  they would have eliminated  Clause  M entirely as being useless, as it is meaningless to say  that when a duty is  imposed upon a person it is necessary to expressly give him a right to perform that duty.  If he did       not have the right to perform that duty, the same would not have been  imposed upon him.   The stipulations in  Clause M are expressed as clearly and explicitly as they could have been under the circumstances.   At the time of the execution of this contract of lease,  it was impossible  to know what would be the requirements of the business during its term of eighteen years. It was likewise impossible for the parties  to have then agreed in detail as to the changes that, might  be necessary. The lessee wished to reserve  to itself the right  to make the changes in  the  property required by its business, and none of the parties could anticipate  what might be required  during this long period  of time.  This right was  conferred upon the  lessee  by the lessors, but the right, as we  have said, had its limitations: that is, the lessee could not prejudice  the solidity  or the value of the building without breaking the contract.</p>
<p>The question was raised as to whether the conduct of the parties in carrying out the terms of this lease has been such as to show or indicate their  intention or understanding  of the meaning of the word "obras" when they  inserted this word in Clause M,  Upon this point the trial court said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"<em>That under and by virtue of the said contract  of lease</em>, the defendant company entered into possession of the leased premises, making therein alterations and  repairs  at a cost of some P60,000, including the removal of the whole front of the  building facing upon,  the Escolta and replacing the same upon  the new street line, established by the city  of Manila, with a modern  and  decorative commercial  front; the removal of the heavy tiled roof and the replacing of the same with  a light galvanized roof; the  removal of various walls and replacing the same with steel columns and girders; the tearing down and rebuilding of a part of the  building and the adding thereto of a camarin upon the Pasig  River; and the building  of a river wall and reclamation of  a considerable amount of ground;  and which alteration  included the removal of  that  part of the wall  in question  which extended from Point A to  Point G on  the  plan of the premises introduced in evidence as defendant's Exhibit No. 9, all of which repairs, alterations, and improvements, were made with the final approval of the plaintiffs, although after much controversy and many disagreements, and to which alterations and improvements the plaintiffs  contributed the sum of about eighteen  hundred pesos paid by the city of Manila for the expropriation  for street purposes of the small strip along the front of the building heretofore mentioned."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These findings of fact are, we think, fully supported by the evidence.  The result is that these important and material changes, which include the removal of a great portion of the very wall in question, were made by virtue of the contract of lease itself.   It is true that the owners objected at first, but afterwards consented in accordance with the provisions of Clause M, and not by reason of any subsequent specific agreement.  After  all, that the defendants have the right under the law and the provisions of Clause M of the contract of lease  to remove the; wall in question, cannot be seriously doubted, provided always that neither the solidity of the building nor its  value be impaired.</p>
<p>Let  us now determine whether or  not  a  removal of the wall in question  (1) will  prejudice either  the solidity of the building or its value, and  (2) if  it is required by the business of the defendants.</p>
<p>The wall which the defendants and interveners propose to remove and substitute in lieu thereof other material is composed of two outer shells of Guadalupe or Meycauayan stone,  filled with lime,  plaster and rubber,  the two shells being bound together by stones laid transversely, the whole wall so formed being about  one meter thick and extending from the front of the building a  distance of about  38 meters toward the Pasig River.   This wall is about  four meters high, extending from the ground floor to the second floor.   The joists and girders supporting the second  floor are embedded in said wall.  There are  two actual openings  in this wall,  with  three  doors  and an  arch, which have been walled up.  The wall is in good  condition, except      that part removed by the defendants before the commencement of this action, and said wall is one of four longitudinal walls, all being approximately of the same  thickness.   The wall in question divides the east half of the ground floor of the building approximately in its center and sustains a part of the weight of the second floor of this  east half, together with  a partition  forming one of the divisions of the second floor.   But it does not sustain any of the weight of the roof, this weight  being distributed by  means of trusses to the outer  walls  of the building.  About one-third  of  this  wall,  or that part  nearest  the  Pasig, has already been removed, and  the removal of the  same was approved by the  owners.  The interveners  now propose to remove the  remaining two-thirds and substitute in lieu thereof other material, using the material  of the old wall for filling up certain openings in  other walls of the building.   This old  wall, according to the experts, offers very little resistance to lateral shocks or motions.  Practically all of  the resistance of lateral shocks or motions is furnished by the cross-walls.  Again, according to the opinion of the experts the building will  be greatly strengthened against earthquakes or  unusual shocks  or force, and  its durability increased by the removal of the  remaining part of the wall in question and the substitution in lieu thereof of reinforced concrete posts or pillars and arches, taking the material and filling, as the interveners propose to do, the openings in some  of the other walls.  Such  proposed removal,  if carried  out, will practically double  the  floor space  of  the drug store and greatly increase  its rental value,  and also greatly  increase  the actual value of the building.  This extra floor  space is absolutely  essential to the business  carried on in this part of the building.  The foregoing are substantially the findings of  the trial court, based upon the  testimony of expert witnesses, and an ocular inspection of the premises.  These facts  show clearly and beyond a question that  the  removal of the remainder of this old wall will not only  not prejudice the solidity of the building,  but greatly increase its  solidity  and  durability, as, according to the opinion of the experts, the reinforced concrete posts and arches  will offer  greater  resistance to earthquakes or baguios than  the  old wall; that both  the intrinsic and rental value of the building will be increased; and that this removal is required by the business.</p>
<p>Lastly, counsel for the appellants say:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The plaintiffs contend that a contract is only binding on the parties thereto as provided in article 1257  of  the Civil Code  and that, although a sublessee is bound  to  the lessor as provided  in articles  1551 and  1552 yet this is not an obligation arising out of contract but one founded in law and  the relation of the parties  to property, and that the lessor has  no obligation towards the sublessee as such at all either legal  or of contract and that therefore even if by  clause (<em>m</em>) of the  lease the  plaintiffs  had the obligation to permit the defendant to take out the wall to suit the  convenience of its own business, that such an obligation was purely personal between the parties  to  the lease and since the contract of lease is not assignable this right could not be transferred by defendant or made  use of by defendant for the benefit of other persons."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A lease may be of things, works, or services.   (Art. 1542, Civil Code.)   In a lease of things, one  of the parties thereto binds  himself to give to  the other the enjoyment or  use of a thing for a specified time and for a fixed price.  (Art. 1543, <em>idem</em>.)</p>
<p>Article 1550 of the Civil Code reads:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Should it not be expressly forbidden  in the contract of lease of things, the lessee  may  sublet  the whole or a part of the things leased  without prejudice to his liability for the fulfillment of the contract executed with the lessor."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is  nothing in the contract of lease in the case at bar which  even tends  to  prohibit the lessee  from sub-letting the whole or any part of the leased premises.  The lessee's right to do this cannot be  questioned, and  his subtenant is not only obligated to  carry out his part  of the contract with the sublessor, but  he  is also bound  to the lessors for all of the  acts  which refer to  the use and            preservation of the premises, in the manner agreed upon between the lessors and the lessee.   The lessors can compel the subtenant to comply with these  conditions.  This sets up the privity between  the lessors and the subtenant. But it  is  said  that the  contract of  lease in question is not assignable.   This  contract is an  ordinary one, under which the  lessee as we have said,  has  a perfect  right to sublet the whole of the  premises  for  the entire time. Should the lessee do this, would it not amount to an assignment of the contract of lease?   The power of assignment is incident to the  state of  every lessee  of things, unless he has been restrained by the terms of his lease.   In  the contract of lease in question, the  lessors, by  Clause M, agree that the lessee may make  such changes as its business requires, provided that neither  the  solidity nor  the value of  the building  is  prejudiced.  This is  a  specific right granted to the lessee.  This right is a part of  the lease itself and affects directly  the  thing leased.  It is not, therefore, a personal obligation  between the lessors and the  lessee.</p>
<p>We  are,  therefore,  of the opinion that the  judgment appealed from should be affirmed with costs  against  the appellant.</p>
<p><em>Johnson, Carson,</em>  and <em>Moreland, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<em>Arellano, C. J.,</em> and <em>Mapa, J.,</em> dissent.<br>

  <span style="font-style: italic;">DISSENTING

<p style="font-weight: bold;">TORRES, J.:</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the  respect the opinion of the majority deserves, I regret that  I can not agree with the  foregoing decision in so far as it  allows the defendant, A. S. Watson &amp; Co., or the intervener,  The Philippines  Drug Company, to remove  the wall in question on condition that they  replace it by pillars and arches of reinforced concrete, with the remaining circumstances set forth.</p>
<p>In my opinion this point in the judgment appealed from should be  reversed by  sustaining  the  injunction  issued by  the  court and ordering  the  destroyed wall  to be  restored to the form  and condition it previously had.</p>
<p>The destruction of this wall amounts to a change in form and an  essential modification of the condition of solidity the poperty had before it was removed.   The best proof that it was not expedient to remove the wall was being torn down, the building was propped up and<br>
  another wall erected to replace the one taken out.</p>
<p>Article 1557 of the Civil code prescribes:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The lessor can not change the form of the thing leased."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Article 1561 thereof says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The lessee must return the estate at the expiration of the lease in the same condition in which he received it, except what may have been destroyed or impaired by the time or by unavoidable reasons."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the contract of lease appears the following Clause M:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The leasing company may perform on the property the work required by the business ir has established therein, provided that the solidity of the building is not damaged or its value affected."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The defendants proceeded to tear down said wall in violation of the provisions of the law and the agreement in the contract of lease, for the clause quoted does not authorize them to destroy the central wall of the building, even  with the intention of replacing it by another wall of concrete,  and in doing so they changed the form of the building and performed work not authorized in the contract, and which essentially affects the solidity of the building.</p>
<p>Even though said clause provides that the leasing company perform the work required by the business it has established therein, yet the same clause says: provided that the solidity  of the building is not damaged or its value affected. By tearing down the wall in question and changing its form as the central support of the whole weight of the second story and of the framework of the roof, the defendant company   undoubtedly performed work which essentially affects the solidity and the value of the structure.</p>
<p>The convenience of the tenant, not admitted by the owner, is no legal reason or cause whereby the former may after the condition of the property, as there was no express stipulation that the said wall might be torn down, it is impossible to assert that the leasing company has not violated the contract and the legal provision which protects the right of the owner, who should in no sense be at  the mercy of the caprice and convenience of the tenant, for that would give rise to a genuine transgression upon he right of property.</p>
<p>One of the obligations of lease under article 1555 is to use the thing leased like a  careful  householder by applying it to the use agreed upon, and, in default of agreement, to use that may be inferred from the nature of the thing leased according to the custom of the land.  There is no custom in this country whereby a tenant may without permission pf the owner tear down in this way a central wall that upholds  building.</p>
<p>In a country like this, where the ground is frequently shaken  y an enormous internal force, causing violent earthquakes, it is customary to build for the solidity of  the structure walls of size an extent such as that of the property in question, which was destroyed by the defendant party by and for itself.  In spite of the defects ascribed thereto, it is sufficient to assert that said wall has withstood all the violent earthquakes that have occurred during the latter half of the past century, and yet it was arbitrarily torn  down without the knowledge and consent of the owners and in spite  of n injunction of the court, not because it was not solid but because  it was thick and wide and took up a good deal of space in the place which the defendant company wished to use to its full extent.  A concrete wall, with which the destroyed stone was replaced, would be more convenient for the interests of the defendant because it would take up less room, but the solidity of concrete walls in this land of earthquakes has not yet received stamp of conclusive test in one of those violent phenomena, happily not yet experienced since the concrete building have been erected here.  But if the will of the parties is the law in contracts not contrary to law,  morality and public order, and in cases not foreseen by the interested parties, the rules and provisions of law that protect the reciprocal rights and duties of the contracting parties, the leasing company unquestionably had  no right to tear down the  wall in question and replace it  by another of concrete without the  consent and against  the express objection of the owners of the property.</p>
<p>Therefore,  I  think that the  first part of the judgment appealed from should be affirmed and that the second part, referring to the authorization therein  conferred  upon  the defendant party to remove the wall in question and replace it  by another of concrete with the conditions  set forth, ought to be reversed and the defendant party ordered to replace  the destroyed wall  in  the form and condition it formerly had, with the "costs against the defendant party.</p>
