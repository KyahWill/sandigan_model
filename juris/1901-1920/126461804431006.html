				<BR><STRONG>MCDONOUGH, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The defendant was charged with the crime of frustrated murder,  committed in the  city  of Manila November 2, 1902, in that he did then and there willfully,  feloniously, and with  deliberate premeditation assault  Aniceto Reyes by attempting to shoot him.</p>
<p>The defendant was  placed upon trial in the Court of First  Instance of  Manila  December  17,  1902, and  was convicted and sentenced to  imprisonment  for a term of eight years, and to  pay the costs of the prosecution.</p>
<p>The defendant and Aniceto Reyes were members of the Constabulary,  and, on November 2,  1902,  they were engaged in gambling in their quarters.  During the game a dispute arose between Reyes and the defendant regarding a debt of 30 cents, which the defendant claimed Reyes owed him.   The defendant demanded payment of this sum, and Reyes asked for a little time to make payment, not desiring to then open his box in which he had money and upon which they were sitting during the game.   Thereupon this witness and the defendant got into a fight, using their fists and uttering obscene language.  The defendant withdrew from this quarrel, went to the gun rack near by, took down a gun, loaded' it, and aimed it at the witness, who testified that the defendant insisted on trying to shoot  at the feet of the witness, and during a struggle between the two for  the gun it was discharged by the defendant, the bullet striking the floor about 5 inches from the feet of the witness.</p>
<p>In  the quarrel, before the discharge of the gun, each party claimed that the other struck the first  blow.</p>
<p>Reyes testified that when he saw the defendant  coming toward him with the gun, he was about  3  yards away. He had the gun in his hand, and said to the witness, "Are you going to pay me  or not?"  Reyes  answered,  "Yes, I will pay you.   "Wait a minute.  I  have my money in the box;" and then the defendant pushed Reyes with the gun, and Reyes grabbed it.  Francisco Gaspar, a member of the Constabulary, testified that he was present on the occasion in question; that the defendant was losing money in the game,  and, needing more, he was  trying to  collect from tteyes  30 cents.  Reyes said,  "Wait a  minute; I won't pay you,"   Defendant then stood up and said, "Won't you pay me?" and  they  started  to  fight. Defendant  was smaller than the other man, and when he could fight no longer he ran away and got a gun, and when the other saw him coming with the gun he jumped at once, and went to meet him, took hold of the gun, and told him to let go of it. He  would not give up the gun, and discharged it.</p>
<p>The  defendant and Reyes had bunks within a few feet of each another in tho barracks.  The carbines were kept in a rack, and defendant took the carbine from the rack, about 3 brassas from where they were gambling.</p>
<p>Witness testified that he saw defendant load the gun. Reyes struck the first blow.   He  stood up and said lie would not pay  defendant and then struck him, and defendant stood up and struck Reyes  when he said he would not pay him.</p>
<p>Defendant was sworn in his own  behalf and testified substantially  as did the other witnesses  regarding  the gambling, the debt  of  30 cents, the demand for it,  the refusal, and the fight.  He said he ran and grabbed  the gun with the intention of hitting Reyes with the butt of it. Reyes caught hold of the gun and  tried to take it away, and during the struggle the shot was fired.</p>
<p>In  order  to convict the defendant in this case of  the crime of frustrated murder, it was necessary to prove that the defendant with  deliberate premeditation intended to kill Reyes.</p>
<p>The crime  of frustrated murder is committed when the guilty person performs all the acts of execution which should produce the crime as their consequence, but nevertheless do not constitute it by reason of causes independent of the will of the perpetrator.</p>
<p>Evidently the defendant had not  the intent to kill.   He did not aim to kill.  He did not threaten to kill.  Nor can it be inferred, as it was in the court below, that an intent to kill was  proved when the defendant testified that he intended to hit Reyes with the butt  end of his gun.   Such a blow might do bodily harm and might not, depending on its force and the part of the body  struck;  it might even result  in death, but  the conclusion does not follow that the defendant with deliberate premeditation tried to kill Reyes,</p>
<p>The defendant, however, violated article 408 of the Penal Code in that he discharged a firearm at Reyes.</p>
<p>He is therefore convicted of the crime of discharging a firearm at a person, and is sentenced to imprisonment for one year and one month <em>provisional correccional</em> with costs <em>de oficio</em>.</p>
<p><em> Arellano, C, J., Torres, Cooper, Willard,</em> and <em>Mapa, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
