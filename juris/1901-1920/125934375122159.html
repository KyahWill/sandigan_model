				<BR><STRONG>MAPA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> The defendant was charged with libel as the editor of a weekly paper  in  which  certain defamatory matter  was published in the issue of August 25, 1901.  To prove  that he was such editor the prosecution presented certain copies of an issue of the same paper dated October 6, 1901.  There being no other evidence to connect the defendant with the publication of the libel, he was acquitted.  The private prosecutor appealed the case to the Supreme Court. The number of the paper in  which the alleged libelous article was published, dated August 25, 1901, did not  contain the name of the defendant  either as director or otherwise.</p>
<p> To prove  that  he  was such director  the  complainant offered and there was received in evidence a number of the papers published October  6, 1901, in which the defendant is referred to as such director.  No other evidence was offered Tby the complainant.   Without deciding whether this was or was not sufficient to prove that the defendant was the director of the paper on October 6, we  hold that it was not sufficient to prove that he was  such director on August 25.   The judgment is affirmed with costs against the appellant.</p>
<p>  <em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Cooper,  Willard, Smith, Ladd,</em> and <em>Mapa, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
