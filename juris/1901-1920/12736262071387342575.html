				G.R. No. 13465, November 26, 1918</h4>
				<H3>JULIAN LANUZA, AS ADMINISTRATOR OF THE INTESTATE ESTATE OF TIMOTEO LANUZA, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. JOS. N. WOLFSON AND THE PROVINCIAL SHERIFF OF RIZAL, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>STREET, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The defendant, J. N. Wolfson, on June 9, 1915, lent the sum of P1,200 to 
Candida Pazcoguin, and as security for the payment of the notes evidencing the 
indebtedness took a chattel mortgage (Exhibit 1) on the furniture and 
cinematographic equipment in the "Cine Luna" in Malabon, which was then being 
operated by Candida Pazcoguin. Upon failure on the part of the debtor to meet 
promptly the obligations expressed in her notes and in the chattel mortgage, the 
defendant Wolfson took possession and proceeded to sell the mortgaged property 
in conformity with the provisions of Act No. 1508 and the stipulations of the 
mortgage itself. At the sale which was effected by the sheriff of the Province 
of Rizal on August 31, 1915, the defendant Wolfson became the purchaser for the 
sum of P325.
<p>Prior to this sale, the plaintiff Julian Lanuza, as administrator of the 
estate of Timoteo Lanuza, intervened and gave notice to the sheriff that the 
property in question belonged to the intestate estate of Timoteo Lanuza. The 
sheriff, however, proceeded under indemnity to make the sale; and the plaintiff 
instituted this action to compel the restoration of the property sold or the 
payment of damages therefor in the amount of P1,500. In the Court of First 
Instance, judgment was rendered in favor of the defendant and the plaintiff 
appealed.</p>
<p>It appears in evidence that on February 23, 1914, Candida Pazcoguin, being 
then the owner of the house and lot where the cinematograph above mentioned was 
being conducted, as well as of the cinematographic apparatus and furniture used 
in connection therewith, executed a contract of sale with <span style="font-style: italic;">pacto de retro</span> in 
favor of Timoteo Lanuza, covering said lot, cinematographic establishment, its 
furniture, and accessories, for the sum of P2,500, the period for redemption 
being fixed at two years (Exhibit A). Upon February 24, 1914, the same parties 
made another similar contract, increasing the amount of the purchase from P2,500 
to P3,000, but maintaining the other provisions of the contract without material 
alteration. Both these contracts were ratified before a notary public, and the 
incumbrance thus created on the house and lot were noted in the Torrens title 
issued to Candida Pazcoguin in January, 1915. The chattel mortgage executed by 
Candida Pazcoguin on June 9, 1915, in favor of J. N. Wolf son covered the same 
chattels that had been included in the aforesaid sales by <span style="font-style: italic;">pacto de retro</span> to 
Timoteo Lanuza.</p>
<p>The evidence shows, we think, that, as the trial court found, at the time the 
chattel mortgage was executed Wolfson had no knowledge that the chattels in 
question had been sold to Timoteo Lanuza, though he was aware from the recitals 
contained in the Torrens title for the lot on which the cine stood that the lot 
itself had been sold to Lanuza.</p>
<p>As is commonly provided in contracts of sale with <span style="font-style: italic;">pacto de retro</span>, it was 
agreed that the vendor, Candida Pazcoguin, should remain in possession, as 
tenant of Timoteo Lanuza, upon a rental contract during the period of 
redemption, paying a stipulated sum for the rent of the premises; and, in 
accordance with this provision, she did in fact retain possession and continued 
to run the cinematograph until after the chattel mortgage in favor of Wolfson 
had been executed.</p>
<p>The sole question in the case is whether a chattel mortgage duly executed and 
registered in conformity with the provisions of Act No. 1508 takes precedence 
over a prior sale, with <span style="font-style: italic;">pacto de retro</span>, duly executed and ratified before a 
notary public. It is not questionable that both Timoteo Lanuza and J. N. Wolfson 
acted in good faith, and it is clear that the latter put his money into the loan 
in entire ignorance of the prior sale to Lanuza.</p>
<p>The conclusion upon the facts stated is, in our opinion, that the title to 
these chattels passed out of Candida Pazcoguin to Timoteo Lanuza at the time of 
the execution of the first contract of sale with <span style="font-style: italic;">pacto de retro</span>, to-wit, on 
January 23, 1914, in favor of Lanuza. It results that when Candida Pazcoguin 
mortgaged the chattels to Wolfson, she was not the owner and had at most a mere 
privilege to repurchase on or before January 23, 1916. It is regrettable that 
there is no sure means whereby a person, circumstanced as was the defendant in 
this case, can discover whether or not the property offered as security has been 
already sold to another, but the law does not require the registration of 
contracts of sale with <span style="font-style: italic;">pacto de retro</span>, as a device for the protection of 
subsequent purchasers; and a person who buys or takes a mortgage upon property 
of this character must beware.</p>
<p>Evidence for the plaintiff tends to show that the articles seized by the 
defendant and sold by him were worth about P1,800; and as the defendant had 
advanced the sum of P1,200 upon the security of the chattel mortgage, we have no 
doubt that their value may be reasonably taken to be P1,500, the amount claimed 
as damages in the complaint.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from must be reversed, and the defendants are hereby 
enjoined to deliver to the plaintiff the articles described in the complaint and 
in default thereof they shall pay to the plaintiff the sum of fifteen hundred 
pesos (P1,500), for which execution may issue. If part, but not all, of the 
articles in question should be returned, the court of origin shall determine 
equitably, upon such proof as may be adduced before it, the proportionate 
deduction to be made from the total amount awarded as damages. No special 
adjudication of costs is made. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson, Avance√±a</em>, and <em>Malcolm, 
JJ.</em>, concur.</p></div>
