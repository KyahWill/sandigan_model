				G.R. No. 8375, March 30, 1914</h4>
				<H3>INTERISLAND EXPRESS CO., PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. THE INSULAR COLLECTOR OF CUSTOMS, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The principles on which we must dispose of this appeal are clearly and 
definitely announced in our opinions in the cases of Behn, Meyer &amp; Co. vs. 
Collector of Customs (17 Phil. Rep., 388), and Behn, Meyer &amp; Co. 
<em>vs.</em> Collector of Customs (26 Phil Rep., 647), recently decided.</p>
<p>As stated by the Collector in his decision on plaintiff's protest, "the 
various charges included in the value returned are not segregated and cannot be 
ascertained from the invoice nor the bill of lading, and no bond was filed for 
the production of a corrected consular invoice in accordance with Tariff 
Decision Circular No. 957."</p>
<p>Under the rulings in the above-cited cases it is very clear that the decision 
of the Collector of Customs cannot be disturbed on appeal, plaintiff having 
failed to comply with the statutory regulations touching the filing of his 
protest against the alleged excessive assessment of customs duties.</p>
<p>Let judgment be entered reversing the judgment entered in the court below and 
affirming the decision of the Collector of Customs, with the costs in both 
instances against the appellant. </p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Moreland, Trent,</em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.,</em> 
concur.<br></p></div>
