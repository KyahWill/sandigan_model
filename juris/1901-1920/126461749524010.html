				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The evidence  shows that in October, 1902, the defendant Santos  was in the command of a band  of so-called Katipunan soldiers  who  were operating  in  the Provinces of Rizal and Bulacan.   His  soldiers had captured Toinas Testa, the president of the pueblo of Meycauayan, and his brother Francisco Testa.  They were kept in confinement for three days,  then  taken from the <em>cuartel</em>, carried to a place called Caingin, and there executed  by the defendants Alejo Oeneta. and Santiago Juan, in the presence of Santos and by  his orders, he handing to Santiago  Juan  the dagger with which the latter killed Tomas.   There is no doubt as to the guilt of the two defendants.</p>
<p>The deceased were bound at the time they were killed. This shows the existence of the qualifying circumstances of <em>alevosia</em> and raises the offense to the crime of <em>asesinato</em>. As to Julian Santos, there existed also the aggravating circumstance of known  premeditation.  The  case as to this circumstance, with reference to Santos, is fully covered by the case of the United States <em>vs.</em> Ricafor, decided March 19, 1902.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p>
<p>The same can not, however, be said as to the other de- fendant.  Article 79 of the Penal Code is as follows:  "Aggravating or extenuating  circumstances which consist in the moral disposition of the delinquent, or in his particular relations with the  injured person, or any other personal cause, shall serve to increase or mitigate the responsibility solely of such principals or  accessories as to whom these conditions exist.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Those which  consist  in the material execution of the act or in the means employed for its commission shall serve to augment or mitigate the responsibility solely of those who had  knowledge of  such circumstances  at the moment of the act or of their cooperation in the commission of the crime."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The circumstance of "known premeditation" falls within the first paragraph.of this article.</p>
<p>The evidence shows that this organization of Santos was of a military character.   It appears that he was a general, one Vicente  was his captain,  and one Esteban was his lieutenant.  Santiago Juan was, according to the defendant  Santos himself,  either  a  sergeant  or a  lieutenant. The witness  Amando was a private  soldier.   Over 100 soldiers  attended the execution.   Under  these circumstances, it  can not  be said that the defendant Alejo premeditated the death  of the  brothers Testa.  He had no control over their fate.  Being only a private soldier, subject to the orders of his general, he could not have known whether  they  were  to be killed  or pardoned  until the moment of committing the act.  As to him, the circumstance of known premeditation did not exist.</p>
<p>The judgment condemning Julian Santos to death is confirmed.   The judgment as to  Alejo Ceneta is reversed and he is convicted of the crime of asesinato, without any circumstances extenuating or aggravating, and sentenced to life imprisonment, with the costs of this instance against the appellants.</p>
