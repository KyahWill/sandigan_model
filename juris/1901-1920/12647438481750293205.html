				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>TRENT, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Don Lucas de Ocampo died on November 18, 1906, possessed of certain real and 
personal property which, by his last will and testament, dated July 26, 1906, he 
left to his three children. The fourth clause of this will reads as follows:
<blockquote>
<p>"I also declare that I have contracted the debts detailed below, and it is my 
desire that they be religiously paid by my wife and executors in the form and at 
the time agreed upon with my creditors."</p></blockquote>
<p>Among the debts mentioned in the list referred to are two in favor of the 
plaintiff, Isidoro Santos; one due on April 14,1907, for P5,000, and various 
others described as falling due at different dates (the dates are not given) 
amounting to the sum of P2,454. The will was duly probated and a committee was 
regularly appointed to hear and determine such claims against the estate as 
might be presented. This committee submitted its report to the court on June 
27,1908. On July 14, 1908, the plaintiff, Isidoro Santos, presented a petition 
to the court asking that the committee be required to reconvene and pass upon 
his claims against the estate which were recognized in the will of the testator. 
This petition was denied by the court, and on November 21, 1910, the plaintiff 
instituted the present proceedings against the administratrix of the estate to 
recover the sums mentioned in the will as due him. Relief was denied in the 
court below, and he now appeals to this court.</p>
<p>In his first assignment of error, the appellant takes exception to the action 
of the court in denying his petition asking that the committee be reconvened to 
consider his claim. In support of this alleged error counsel say that it does 
not appear in the committee's report that the publications required by section 
687 of the Code of Civil Procedure had been duly made. With reference to this 
point the record affirmatively shows that the committee did make the 
publications required by law. It is further alleged that at the time the 
appellant presented his petition the court had not approved the report of the 
committee. If this were necessary we might say that, although the record does 
not contain a formal approval of the committee's report, such approval must 
undoubtedly have been made, as will appear from an inspection of the various 
orders of the court approving the annual accounts of the administratrix, in 
which claims allowed against the estate by the committee were written off in 
accordance with its report. This is shown very clearly from the court's order of 
August 1, 1912, in which the account of the administratrix was approved after 
reducing the final payments on some of the claims against the estate to agree 
with the amounts allowed by the committee. It is further alleged that at the 
time this petition was presented the administration proceedings had not been 
terminated. This is correct.</p>
<p>In his petition of July 14, 1909, asking that the committee be reconvened to 
consider his claims, plaintiff states that his failure to present the said 
claims to the committee was due to his belief that it was unnecessary to do so 
because of the fact that the testator, in his will, expressly recognized them 
and directed that they should be paid. The inference is that had plaintiffs 
claims not been mentioned in the will he would have presented them to the 
committee as a matter of course; that plaintiff was led to believe by this 
express mention of his claims in the will that it would be unnecessary to 
present them to the committee; and that he did not become aware of the necessity 
of presenting them to the committee until after the committee had made its final 
report.</p>
<p>Under these facts and circumstances, did the court err in refusing to 
reconvene the committee for the purpose of considering plaintiff's claims? The 
first step toward the solution of this question is to determine whether 
plaintiff's claims were such as a committee appointed to hear claims against an 
estate is, by law, authorized to pass upon. Unless it was such a claim 
plaintiff's argument has no foundation. Section 686 empowers the committee to 
try and decide claims which survive against executors and administrators, even 
though they be demandable at a future day "except claims for the possession of 
or title to real estate."Section 700 provides that all actions commenced against 
the deceased person for the recovery of money, debt, or damages, pending at the 
time the committee is appointed, shall be discontinued, and the claims embraced 
within such actions presented to the committee. Section 703 provides that 
actions to recover title to or possession of real property, actions to recover 
damages for injury to person or property, real or personal, and actions to 
recover the possession of specified articles of personal property, shall 
survive, and may be commenced and prosecuted against the executor or 
administrator; "but all other actions commenced against the deceased before his 
death shall be discontinued and the claims therein involved presented before the 
committee as herein provided/' Section 708 provides that a claim secured by a 
mortgage or other collateral security may be abandoned and the claim prosecuted 
before the committee, or the mortgage may be foreclosed or the security be 
relied upon, and, in the event of a deficiency judgment, the creditor may, after 
the sale of the mortgage or upon the insufficiency of the security, prove such 
deficiency before the committee on claims. There are also certain provisions in 
section 746 et seq., with reference to the presentation of contingent claims to 
the committee after the expiration of the time allowed for the presentation of 
claims not contingent. Do plaintiff's claims fall within any of these sections? 
They are described in the will as debts. There is nothing in the will to 
indicate that any or all of them are contingent claims, claims for the 
possession of or title to real property, damages for injury to person or 
property, real or personal, or for the possession of specified articles of 
personal propety. Nor is it asserted by the plaintiff that they do. The 
conclusion is that they were claims proper to be considered by the 
committee.</p>
<p>This being true, the next point to determine is, when and under what 
circumstances may the committee be recalled to consider belated claims? Section 
689 provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The court shall allow such time as the circumstances of the case require for 
the creditors to present their claims to the committee for examination and 
allowance; but not, in the first instance, more than twelve months, or less than 
six months; and the time allowed shall be stated in the commission. The court 
may extend the time as circumstances require, but not so that the whole time 
shall exceed eighteen months."</p></blockquote>
<p>It cannot be questioned that this section supersedes the ordinary limitation 
of actions provided for in chapter 3 of the Code. It is strictly confined, in 
its application, to claims against the estates of deceased persons, and has been 
almost universally adopted as part, of the probate law of the United States. It 
is commonly termed the statute of nonclaims, and. its purpose is to settle the 
affairs of the estate with dispatch, so that the residue may be delivered to the 
persons entitled thereto without their being afterwards called upon to respond 
in actions for claims, which, under the ordinary statute of limitations, have 
not yet prescribed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The object of the law in fixing a definite period within which claims must 
be presented is to insure the speedy settling of the affairs of a deceased 
person and the early delivery of the property of the estate into the hands of 
the persons entitled to receive it." (Estate of De Dios, 24 Phil.Rep., 
573.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Due possibly to the comparative shortness of the period of limitation 
applying to such claims as compared with the ordinary statute of limitations, 
the statute of nonclaims has not the finality of the ordinary statute of 
limitations. It may be safely said that a saving provision, more or less 
liberal, is annexed to the statute of nonclaims in every jurisdiction where it 
is found. In this country its saving clause is found in section 690, which reads 
as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"On application of a creditor who has failed to present his claim, if made 
within six months after the time previously limited, or, if a committee fails to 
give the notice required by this chapter, and such application is made before 
the final settlement of the estate, the court may, for cause shown, and on such 
terms as are equitable, renew the commission and allow further time, not 
exceeding one month, for the committee to examine such claim, in which case it 
shall personally notify the parties of the time and place of hearing, and as 
soon as may be make the return of their doings to the court."</p></blockquote>
<p>If the committee fails to give the notice required, that is a sufficient 
cause for reconvening it for further consideration of claims which may not have 
been presented before its final report was submitted to the court. But, as 
stated above, this is not the case made by the plaintiff, as the committee did 
give the notice required by law. Where the proper notice has been given the 
right to have the committee recalled for the consideration of a belated claim 
appears to rest first upon the condition that it is presented within six months 
after the time previously limited for the presentation of claims. In the present 
case the time previously limited was six months from July 23, 1907. This allowed 
the plaintiff until January 23, 1908, to present his claims to the committee. An 
extension of this time under section 690 rested in the discretion of the court. 
(Estate of De Dios, <em>supra.</em>) In other words, the court could extend this 
time and recall the committee for a consideration of the plaintiff's claims 
against the estate if justice required it, at any time within the six months 
after January 23, 1908, or until July 23, 1908. Plaintiff's petition was not 
presented until July 14, 1909. The bar of the statute of nonclaims is as 
conclusive under these circumstances as the bar of the ordinary statute of 
limitations would be. It is generally held that claims are not barred as to 
property not included in the inventory. (Waughop <em>vs.</em> Bartlett, 165 
111., 124; Estate of Reyes, 17 Phil. Rep., 188.) So also, as indicated by this 
court in the case last cited, fraud would undoubtedly have the same effect. 
These exceptions to the operation of the statute are, of course, founded upon 
the highest principles of equity. But what is the plea of the plaintiff in this 
case? Simply this: That he was laboring under a mistake of law—a mistake which 
could easily have been corrected had he sought to inform himself; a lack of 
information as to the law governing the allowance of claims against estates of 
deceased persons which, by proper diligence, could have been remedied in ample 
time to present the claims to the committee. Plaintiff finally discovered his 
mistake and now seeks to assert his rights when they have been lost through his 
own negligence. <em>Ignorantia legis neminem excusat. </em>We conclude that the 
learned trial court made no error in refusing to reconvene the committee for the 
purpose of considering plaintiff's claims against the estate.</p>
<p>In his second assignment of error the appellant insists that the court erred 
in dismissing his petition filed on November 21, 1910/ wherein he asks that the 
administratrix be compelled to pay over to him the amounts mentioned in the will 
as debts due him. We concede all that is implied in the maxim, <em>dicat testor 
et erit lex.</em> But the law imposes certain restrictions upon the testator, 
not only as to the disposition of his estate, but also as to the manner in which 
he may make such disposition. As stated in Rood on Wills, sec. 412: "Some 
general rules have been irrevocably established by the policy of the law, which 
cannot be exceeded or transgressed by any intention of the testator, be it ever 
so clearly expressed."</p>
<p>It may be safely asserted that no respectable authority can be found which 
holds that the will of the testator may override positive provisions of law and 
imperative requirements of public policy. (Page on Wills, sec; 461.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Impossible conditions and those contrary to law and good morals shall be 
considered as not imposed, * * *" (Art. 792, Civil Code.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Conceding for the moment that it was the testator's desire in the present 
case that the debts listed by him in his will should be paid without referring 
them to a committee appointed by the court, can such a provision be enforced? 
May the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure relating to the settlement of 
claims against an estate by a committee appointed by the court be superseded by 
the contents of a will?</p>
<p>It is evident from the brief outline of the sections referred to above that 
the Code, of Civil Procedure has established a system for the allowance of 
claims against the estates of decedents. There are at least two restrictions 
imposed by law upon the power of the testator to dispose of his property, and 
which <em>pro tanto</em> restrict the maxim that "the will of the testator is 
law:" (1) His estate is liable for all legal obligations incurred by him; and 
(2) he can not dispose of or encumber the legal portion due his heirs by force 
of law.</p>
<p>The former take precedence over the latter. (Sec. 640, Code Civ. Proc.) In 
case his estate is sufficient they must be paid. (Sec. 734, id.) In case the 
estate is insolvent they must be paid in the order named in section 735. It is 
hardly necessary to say that a provision in an insolvent's will that a certain 
debt be paid would not entitle it to preference over other debtsi But, if the 
express mention of a debt in the will requires the administrator to pay it 
without reference to the committee, what assurance is there, in the case of an 
insolvent estate, that it will not take precedence over preferred debts?</p>
<p>If it is unnecessary to present such a claim to the committee, the statute of 
nonclaims is not applicable. It is not barred until from four to ten years, 
according1 to its classification in chapter 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 
establishing limitations upon actions. Under such circumstances, when may the 
legal portion be determined ? If, in the meantime, the estate has been 
distributed, what security have the distributees against the interruption of 
their possession? Is the administrator required to pay the amount stipulated in 
the will regardless of its correctness? And, if not, what authority has he to 
vise the claim? Section 706 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that an 
executor may, with the approval of the court, compound with a debtor of deceased 
for a debt due the estate. But he is nowhere permitted or directed to deal with 
a creditor of the estate. On the contrary, he is the advocate of the estate 
before an impartial committee with quasi-judicial power to determine the amount 
of the claims against the estate, and, in certain cases, to equitably adjust the 
amounts due. The administrator, representing the debtor estate, and the creditor 
appear before this body as parties litigant and, if either is dissatisfied with 
its decision, an appeal to the court is their remedy. To allow the administrator 
to examine and approve a claim against the estate would put him in the dual roIe 
of a claimant and judge. The law in this jurisdiction has been so framed that 
this may not occur. The most important restriction, in this jurisdiction, on the 
disposition of property by will are those provisions of the Civil Code providing 
for the preservation of the legal portions due to heirs by force of law, and 
expressly recognized arid continued in force by sections 614, 684, and 753 of 
the Code of Civil Procedure. But if a debt expressly recognized in the will must 
be paid without its being verified, there is nothing to prevent a partial or 
total alienation of the legal portion by means of a bequest under the guise of a 
debt, since all of the latter must be paid before the amount of the legal 
portion can be determined. </p>
<p>We are aware that in some jurisdictions executors and administrators are, by 
law, obligated to perform the duties which, in this jurisdiction, are. assigned 
to the committee on claims; that in some other jurisdictions it is the probate 
court itself that performs these duties; that in some jurisdictions the 
limitation upon the presentment of claims for allowance is longer and, possibly, 
in some shorter; and that there is a great divergence in the classification of 
actions which survive and actions which do not survive the death of the 
testator. It must be further remembered that there are but few of the United 
States which provide for heirs by force of law. These differences render useless 
as authorities in this jurisdiction many of the cases coming from the United 
States. The restriction imposed upon the testator's power to dispose of his 
property when there are heirs by force of law is especially important. The 
rights of these heirs by force of law pass immediately upon the death of the 
testator. (Art. 657, Civil Code.) The state intervenes and guarantees their 
rights by many stringent provisions of law to the extent mentioned in article 
818 of the Civil Code. Having undertaken the responsibility to deliver the legal 
portion of the net assets of the estate to the heirs by force of law, it is idle 
to talk of substituting for the procedure provided by law for determining the 
legal portion, some other procedure provided in the will of the testator. The 
state cannot afford to allow the performance of its obligations to be directed 
by the will of an individual. There is but one instance in which the settlement 
of the estate according to the probate procedure provided in the Code of Civil 
Procedure, may be dispensed with, and it applies only to <em>intestate</em> 
estates. (Sec. 596, Code Civ. Proc.) A partial exemption from the lawful 
procedure is also contained in section 644, when the executor or administrator 
is the sole residuary legatee. Even in such case, and although the testator 
directs that no bond be given, the executor is required to give a bond for the 
payment of the debts of the testator. The facts of the present case do not bring 
it within either of these sections. We conclude that the claims against the 
estate in the case at bar were enforceable only when the prescribed legal 
procedure was followed.<br><br>But we are not disposed to rest our conclusion 
upon this phase of the case entirely upon legal grounds. On the contrary we are 
strongly of the opinion that the application of the maxim, "The will of the 
testator is the law of the case," but strengthens our position so far as the 
present case is concerned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It will ordinarily be presumed in construing a will that the testator is 
acquainted with the rules of law, and that he intended to comply with them 
accordingly. If two constructions of a will or a part thereof are possible, and 
one of these constructions is consistent with the law, and the other is 
inconsistent, the presumption that the testator intended to comply with the law 
will compel that construction which is consistent with the law to be adopted." 
(Page on Wills, sec, 465.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Aside from this legal presumption, which we believe should apply in the 
present case as against any construction of the will tending to show an 
intention of the testator that the ordinary legal method of probating claims 
should be dispensed with, it must be remembered that the testator knows that the 
execution of his will in no way affects his control over his property. The dates 
of his will and of his death may be separated by a period of time more or less 
appreciable. In the meantime, as the testator well knows, he may acquire or 
dispose of property, pay or assume additional debts, etc. In the absence of 
anything to the contrary, it is only proper to presume that the testator, in his 
will, is treating of his estate at the time and in the condition it is in at his 
death. Especially is this true of his debts. Debts may accrue and be paid in 
whole or in part between the time the will is made and the death of the 
testator. To allow a debt mentioned in the will in the amount expressed therein 
on the ground that such was the desire of the testator, when, in fact, the debt 
had been wholly or partly paid, would be not only unjust to the residuary heirs, 
but a reflection upon the good sense of the testator himself. Take the present 
case for example. It would be absurd to say that the testator knew what the 
amount of his just debts would be at a future and uncertain date. A mere 
comparison of the list of creditors of the testator and the amounts due them as 
described in his will, with the same list and the amounts allowed by the 
committee on claims, shows that the testator had creditors at the time of his 
death not mentioned in the will at all. In other instances the amounts due these 
creditors were either greater or less than the amounts mentioned as due them in 
the will. In fact, of those debts listed in the will, not a single one was 
allowed by the committee in the amount named in the will. This shows that the 
testator either failed to list in his will all his creditors and that, as to 
those he did include, he set down an erroneous amount opposite their names; or 
else, which is the only reasonable view of the matter, he overlooked some debts 
or contracted new ones after the will was made and that as to others he did 
include he made partial payments on some and incurred additional indebtedness as 
to others. </p>
<p>While the testator expresses the desire that his debts be paid, he also 
expressly leaves the residue of his estate, in equal parts, to his children. Is 
it to be presumed that he desired to overpay some of his creditors 
notwithstanding his express instructions that his own children should enjoy the 
net assets of his estate after the debts were paid? Again, is the net statement 
of the amount due some of his creditors and the omission altogether of some of 
his other creditors compatible with his honorable and commendable desire, so 
clearly expressed in his will, that all his debts be punctually paid? We cannot 
conceive that such conflicting ideas were present in the testator's mind when he 
made his will. </p>
<p>Again, suppose the testator erroneously charged himself with a debt which he 
was under no legal or even moral obligation to pay. The present case suggests, 
if it does not actually present, such a state of affairs. Among the assets of 
the estate mentioned in the will is a parcel of land valued at P6,500; while in 
the inventory of the administratrix the <em>right to repurchase</em> this land 
from one Isidoro Santos is listed as an asset. Counsel for the administratrix 
alleges that he is prepared to prove that this is the identical plaintiff in the 
case at bar; that the testator erroneously claimed the fee of this land in his 
last will and stated Santos' rights in the same as a mere debt due him of 
P5,000; that, in reality, the only asset of the testator in regard to this land 
was the value of the right to repurchase, while the ownership of the land, 
subject only to that right of redemption, belonged to Santos; that the right to 
repurchase this land expired in 1907, after the testator's death. Assuming, 
without in the least asserting, that such are the underlying facts of this case, 
the unjust consequences of holding that a debt expressly mentioned in the will 
may be recovered without being presented to the committee on claims, is at once 
apparent. In this supposed case, plaintiff needed only wait until the time for 
redemption of the land had expired, when he would have acquired an absolute 
title to the land, and could also have exacted the redemption price. Upon such a 
state of facts, the one item of ?5,000 would be a mere fictitious debt, and as 
the total net value of the estate was less than p15,000, the legal portion of 
the testator's children would be consumed in part in the payment of this item. 
Such a case cannot occur if the prescribed procedure is followed of requiring 
that such claims be visaed by the committee on claims.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The direction in the will for the executor to pay all just debts does not 
mean that he shall pay them without probate. There is nothing in the will to 
indicate that the testator intended that his estate should be administered in 
any other than the regular way under the statute, which requires 'all demands 
against the estates of deceased persons,' 'all such demands as may be 
exhibited,' etc. The statute provides the very means for ascertaining whether 
the claims against the estate are just debts." (Kaufman <em>vs.</em> Redwine, 97 
Ark., 546.)</p></blockquote>
<p>See also Collamore <em>vs.</em> Wilder (19 Kan., 67); O'Neil <em>vs.</em> 
Freeman (45 N. J. L., 208).</p>
<p>The petition of the plaintiff filed on November 21, 1910, wherein he asks 
that the administratrix be compelled to pay over to him the amounts mentioned in 
the will as debts due him appears to be nothing more nor less than a complaint 
instituting an action against the administratrix for the recovery of the sum of 
money. Obviously, the plaintiff is not seeking possession of or title to real 
property or specific articles of personal property.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When a committee is appointed as herein provided, no action or suit shall be 
commenced or prosecuted against the executor or administrator upon a claim 
against the estate to recover a debt due from the estate; but actions to recover 
the seizing and possession of real estate and personal chattels claimed by the 
estate may be commenced against him." (Sec. 699, Code Civ. 
Proc.)</p></blockquote>
<p>The sum of money prayed for in the complaint must be due the plaintiff either 
as a debt or a legacy. If it is a debt, the action was erroneously instituted 
against the administratrix. Is it a legacy?<br><br>Plaintiff's argument at this 
point becomes obviously inconsistent. Under his first assignment of error he 
alleges that the committee on claims should have been reconvened to pass upon 
his claim against the estate. It is clear that this committee has nothing to do 
with legacies. It is true that a debt may be left as a legacy, either to the 
debtor (in which case it virtually amounts to a release), or to a third person. 
But this case can only arise when the debt is an asset of the estate. It would 
be absurd to speak of a testator's leaving a bare legacy of his own debt. (Arts. 
866, 878, Civil Code.)<br>The creation of a legacy depends upon the will of the 
testator, is an act of pure beneficence, has no binding force until his death, 
and may be avoided in whole or in part by the mere whim of the testator, prior 
to that time. A debt arises from an obligation recognized by law (art. 1089, 
Civil Code) and once established, can only be extinguished in a lawful manner. 
(Art. 1156, id.) Debts are demandable and must be paid in legal tender. Legacies 
may, and often do, consist of specific articles of personal property and must be 
satisfied accordingly. In order to collect as a legacy the sum mentioned in the 
will as due him, the plaintiff must show that it is in fact a legacy and not a 
debt. As he has already attempted to show that this sum represents a debt, it is 
an anomaly to urge now it is a legacy.</p>
<p>Was it the intention of the testator to leave the plaintiff a legacy of 
P7,454? We have already touched upon this question. Plaintiff's claim is 
described by the testator as a debt. It must be presumed that he used this 
expression in its ordinary and common acceptation; that is, a legal liability 
existing in favor of the plaintiff at the time the will was made, and demandable 
and payable in legal tender. Had the testator desired to leave a legacy to the 
plaintiff, he would have done so in appropriate language instead of including it 
in a statement of what he owed the plaintiff, the decedent's purpose in listing 
his debts in his will is set forth in the fourth clause of the will, quoted 
above. There is nothing contained in that clause which indicates, even remotely, 
a desire to pay his creditors more than was legally due them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A construction leading to a legal, just and sensible result is presumed to 
be correct, as against one leading to an illegal, unnatural, or absurd effect." 
(Rood on Wills, sec. 426.)</p></blockquote>
<p>The testator, in so many words, left the total net assets of his estate, 
without reservation of any kind, to his children per capita. There is no 
indication that he desired to leave anything by way of legacy to any other 
person. These considerations clearly refute the suggestion that the testator 
intended to leave plaintiff anything by way of a legacy. His claim against the 
estate having been a simple debt, the present action was improperly instituted 
against the administratrix. (Sec. 699, Code Civ. Proc.)</p>
<p>But it is said that the plaintiff's claims should be considered as partaking 
of the nature of a legacy and disposed of accordingly. If this be correct then 
the plaintiff would receive nothing until after all the debts had been paid and 
the heirs by force of law had received their shares. From any point of view the 
inevitable result is that there must be a hearing sometime before some tribunal 
to determine the correctness of the debts recognized in the wills of deceased 
persons. This hearing, in the first instance, can not be had before the court 
because the law does not authorize it. Such debtors must present their claims to 
the committee, otherwise their claims will be forever barred.</p>
<p>For the foregoing reasons the orders appealed from are affirmed, with costs 
against the appellant.</p>

<div align="center">DISSENTING </div>
<p><strong>MORELAND, J.</strong></p>
<p>The decision of the court in this case produces, in my humble opinion, a 
serious miscarriage of justice. It causes the appellant to lose more than 
P7,000, a debt against the respondent estate, which debt, but a few months 
before his death, was specifically recognized by the testator in his will as a 
debt due and owing to petitioner and which he, in said will, ordered and 
directed his executor to pay "religiously."</p>
<p>If I could find justification for such a decision either in the proceedings 
as they are unfolded by the record or in the law as laid down in the Code of 
Civil Procedure, I would, of course, acquiesce. Far from finding such 
justification, I am met, so far as my judgment can discern, with facts of record 
which demonstrate conclusively that the decision is erroneous in fact.</p>
<p>The opinion seeks to demonstrate that a creditor, whose claim is recognized 
by the highest possible authority, the debtor himself, in the most solemn 
instrument known to the law, his last will and testament, as legal, just and 
valid, must lose that claim <em>because the validity thereof has not been 
established by a committee.</em> And this in spite of the fact that, upon the 
record of the case, no one interested in the estate disputes the claim or 
challenges its validity. Take this proposition in connection with the fact that 
the committee to hear claims has not been discharged, that the estate has not 
been finally closed but is still pending settlement, and that, therefore, there 
exists not a single reason, in equity or justice, why the claimant should not be 
permitted to present his claim, if that is necessary, and we have before us a 
situation which indicates how far the decision has gone.</p>
<p>It should be carefully observed that the petitioner Isidoro Santos, was 
defeated in this litigation upon the ground, <em>and the sole ground,</em> that 
he did not present his claim to the committee, in pursuance of a notice to 
creditors published under an order dated <em>July 23,1907,</em> and that he, 
therefore, lost the right to enforce the claim; that the notice having been 
published from <em>July 25,1907,</em> to <em>August 16,1907,</em> petitioner's 
application on July 14, 1909, for the extension of time for the presentation of 
claims to the old committee or the appointment of a new committee for that 
purpose, was too late and was properly denied, and that his motion made November 
21, 1909, praying that the executor be compelled to carry out the wishes of the 
testator and pay the claim, was also properly denied.</p>
<p>In my judgment the decision is erroneous from whatever point viewed:</p>
<p>1. Even if it be assumed that the notice to creditor should have been 
published in accordance with the order of July 23, 1907, the record is entirely 
lacking in legal evidence to establish the publication which the law requires 
under that order. That being so the claim is not barred.</p>
<p>2. I contend, and the record shows, that the notice should not have been 
published in accordance with the order of July 23, 1907, but in pursuance of the 
order of January 8, 1908, which was an order for a new publication, and, being a 
later order, necessarily vacated and annulled the order of July 23, 1907, and 
all proceedings thereunder relative to the matters included in said order of 
<em>January 8, 1908;</em> that publication was concededly never made under and 
in pursuance of that order and that, for that reason, the petitioner's claim is 
not barred.</p>
<p>3. The claim was not one that must be submitted to a committee, being 
recognized as a legal and valid debt by the will and the testator having ordered 
his executor to pay it. The motion made to require the executor to pay the claim 
should have been heard by the court.</p>
<p>The facts of this case, as shown by the record, are:</p>
<p>Don Lucas de Ocampo made a will July 26, 1906. He died November 18,1906. The 
will specifically named Isidoro Santos, the petitioner, a creditor of the 
testator, set out the specific amount due him, named an executor, and directed 
him to pay the claim "religiously."</p>
<p>The will was probated July 15, 1907, and Leandra Manarang, the widow, 
appointed temporary administratrix. Her administration was terminated on July 
23, 1907, and Cosme Naval, the person named in the will as executor, was, on 
that date, duly appointed executor. On the same day Pedro Abad Santos and Marcos 
Tancuaco were named the committee of appraisal and to hear claims presented 
against the estate, the court making the following order: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There having been heard the petition presented by Senor Cosme Naval, praying 
that he be appointed executor of the above named estate as provided in the will 
of the deceased Lucas de Ocampo; and also praying the appointment of a committee 
of appraisal consisting of Senores Pedro Abad Santos and Marcos Tancuaco:</p>
<p>"It is ordered that the said Cosme Naval may be and he hereby is appointed 
executor of the will of Lucas de Ocampo, deceased, the clerk being authorized to 
issue in favor of said Cosme Naval letters testamentary, the petitioner being 
first required to take the oath prescribed by law and to file a bond in the sum 
of P500 Philippine currency, with two sureties satisfactory to the court.</p>
<p>"It is also ordered that the special letters of administration issued 
temporarily in favor of the widow of the deceased, Leandra Manarang, remain 
without effect from this day.</p>
<p>"It is further ordered that Señores <em>Pedro Abad Santos</em> and Marcos 
Tancuaco be and they hereby are appointed the committee of appraisal and claims 
of this estate."</p></blockquote>
<p>On the 28th of September, 1907, Naval was removed from office and Leandra 
Manarang named in his place. On December 3, same year, Pedro Abad Santos 
resigned from the committee to become the attorney for the estate and Donato 
Iturralde was appointed in his stead.</p>
<p>Following these changes both in the office of executor and in that of the 
committee, on January 8, 1908, the court made an order which, in itself, is, in 
my judgment, a complete refutation of the decision in this case and demonstrates 
that a contrary judgment should have been rendered.</p>
<p>That order, dated, as I have said, on January 8, 1908, and promulgated on 
that day, reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Whereas, the Hon. Julio Llorente, in decree dated December 3, 1907, 
appointed Señor Donato Iturralde, a resident of this city, to the office of 
committee of appraisal in the above-entitled proceeding:</p>
<p>"Therefore, and in compliance with the above-mentioned decree, Senor Donato 
Iturralde, a resident of this city, is appointed a member of the committee of 
appraisal and to hear the claims that may be presented against the property of 
this estate, which committee within thirty days from the date of said decree 
shall deliver a copy of the inventory to this court and another to the 
administratrix Senora Leandra Manarang, and within sixty days shall post $ 
notice at the main door of this courthouse and in three public places in the 
municipality where the property of the said deceased is located, in which shall 
be stated the dates and places when and where the meetings of the committee will 
be held and notifying the creditors that they should present their claims within 
six months counting from the date of said notice; said notice, furthermore, to 
be published during three consecutive weeks in the newspaper 'El Imparcial,' 
having general circulation in this province.</p>
<p>"Given today, the 8th of January, 1908, by order of the Hon. Julio Llorente, 
Judge of the Fourth Judicial District and of this Province of 
Pampanga."</p></blockquote>
<p>On July 14, 1908, the committee filed a report, the only report in the 
record, in which appears the following statement :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The undersigned, committee of appraisal and claims against the above estate, 
presents to the court the following list of all the claims presented against the 
said estate since the <em>25th of July, 1907, on which date the first 
publication to creditors was made."</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The publication under which the committee was reporting was begun under the 
order of <em>July 23, 1907,</em> which was vacated and annulled by the order of 
January 8,1908, which, by reason of the changes in the offices of executor and 
committee, ordered <em>a new and different notice to creditors.</em></p>
<p>On July 14, 1909, petitioner herein made an application to the court to 
reopen the sessions of the committee and permit him to present the claim 
mentioned in the will. This was denied November 27, 1909, the court simply 
saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This cause having been heard and the parties having presented their 
arguments, the motion is denied by reason of the lapse of 
time."</p></blockquote>
<p>On November 21, 1910, the petitioner moved the court that, the testator 
having recognized and legalized the debt in his will and having ordered his 
executor to pay the same to the petitioner, said executor be ordered and 
directed to pay said claim to the petitioner pursuant to the testator's 
directions. This motion was denied April 26,1911,<em> upon the same ground as 
the other motion.</em></p>
<p>The appeal is from both of these orders and brings up so much of the record 
as is pertinent to these questions.</p>
<p>The court has held on this appeal: </p>
<p>1. That the motion last mentioned is <em>an action.</em> The opinion says: 
"The petition of the plaintiff filed on November 21, 1910, * * * appears to be 
nothing more or less than a complaint instituting an action against the 
administratrix for the recovery of the sum of money." After discussing this 
phase of the case the court concludes: "His claim against the estate having been 
a simple debt, the present action was improperly instituted against the 
administratrix (sec. 699, Code Civ. Proc.)." This is one of the grounds of the 
decision.</p>
<p>2. That the recognition of the debt in the will and the direction of the 
testator to pay the same have no significance in law.</p>
<p>3. That, notwithstanding this recognition and direction, the claim should 
have been presented to the committee appointed to hear and determine claims 
against the estate.</p>
<p>4. That the claim was not presented to the committee. </p>
<p>5. That all of the formalities required by law relative to the notice to the 
creditors to present their claims were fully observed, the court saying that 
"the record affirmatively shows that the committee did make the publications 
required by law."</p>
<p>6. That the court below did not err in denying the motion to extend the time 
of the old committee or appoint a new one to the end that the claim in question 
might be presented.</p>
<p>7. That the court did not err in denying the motion to compel the executor to 
pay the claim in pursuance of the direction contained in the will.</p>
<p>Laying aside for a moment those holdings of the court which declare that the 
claim is one which must be presented to and passed upon by a committee, I am 
compelled to differ from every other proposition and statement of fact appearing 
in the decision pertinent to the issue involved, except the single one that the 
claim was not presented to a committee. That it was not presented is conceded; 
indeed, the fact that it was not is the whole cause of this proceeding.</p>
<p>I am compelled to believe that the statement of the decision that "the record 
affirmatively shows that the committee did make the publications required by 
law," is not quite inaccordance with the record as I read it.</p>
<p>The opinion does not refer me to any evidence of record which supports its 
statement. Where is this evidence, where is this record which "affirmatively 
shows?" I have been unable to find it. Here is all of the evidence, if it may be 
called evidence, which I am able to find in the record relative to the 
publication of the notices to creditors:</p>
<p>(<em>a</em>) An affidavit of the publisher of "El Imparcial" setting out that 
the notice to creditors attached to the affidavit and signed by <em>Pedro Abad 
Santos</em> (who, before the completion of the publication, resigned) and Marcos 
Tancuaco, dated July 23, <em>1907,</em> was published "three weeks from the 25th 
of July to the 16th of August, <em>1907."</em></p>
<p>The notice referred to is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The undersigned committee of appraisal hereby notifies the creditors of 
Lucas de Ocampo, deceased, and all other persons who have claims against the 
estate of said deceased, to present the same with vouchers within six months 
from the date of this notice to the committee, every Monday, between 4 and 5 
o'clock p. m., at the dwelling house of <em>Pedro A. Santos,</em> Sagasta 
Street, San Fernando, Pampanga. Dated San Fernando, Pampanga, P. I., July 23, 
1907. Signed: Pedro Abad Santos, committee. Marcos Tancuaco, 
committee."</p></blockquote>
<p>The defectiveness of the affidavit is apparent. It does not show whether the 
newspaper was daily, weekly, bi-weekly or monthly, or the day of the week or 
month on which published. It does not show that the notice was published three 
weeks <em>successively,</em> that is, <em>once each week</em> for three 
successive weeks, as required by law and the owJer of the court. So ambiguous is 
it that is might mean that the notice was published once, namely, three weeks 
from July 25. Passing, however, these defects, I note that the notice to 
creditors requires them to present their claims at the <em>dwelling house of 
Pedro Abad Santos.</em> It should be noted, as before stated, that this 
commissioner resigned before the expiration of the six months, thus making it 
necessary for creditors to present their claims <em>and their proofs 
thereof</em> to one who was not a member of the committee and to a man who, 
immediately on. his resignation, <em>became the attorney of the estate.</em> 
This will become important when we later discuss the significance of the fact 
that the court, as already seen, on January 8, <em>1908,</em> <em>made a new 
order</em> requiring that a new notice be given to creditors, <em>to be 
published thereafter,</em> thereby revoking the order of July 23, 1907, and 
annulling the notice to creditors above set out and then in course of 
publication.</p>
<p>(<em>b</em>) The remaining item of evidence which it is claimed tends to show 
that the notice to creditors was duly published is the reference made by the 
commissioners in their report to the court, above quoted, in which they say, 
referring to July 25, 1907, "on which date the first publication to creditors 
was made."</p>
<p>This reference cannot be called evidence of publication, although the court 
accepts it as such. At most it refers and is limited, in terms, to the first 
publication. It has riot the slightest reference to the other publications, if 
any.</p>
<p>This, (<em>a</em>) and (<em>b</em>), is all the evidence in the whole record 
relative to the publication of the notice to creditors. Admitting it all to be 
true and giving it all the weight possible, does it establish "affirmatively 
that the committee did make the publications required by law?" I am of the 
opinion not. The law requires, in addition to the publication in the newspapers, 
that "the committee * * * shall post a notice in four public places in the 
province stating the times and places of their meetings, and the time limited 
for creditors to present their claims * * *" and give such other notice as the 
court directs.</p>
<p>Where is there in the record evidence showing that this was done? Nowhere. As 
I read the record, there is not a syllable of such evidence in all the case.</p>
<p>I, therefore, am forced to the conclusion that the declaration of the court 
that "the record affirmatively shows that the committee did make the 
publications required by law" is without sufficient evidence to support it. </p>
<p>After a thorough reading of the record, I am reluctantly forced to a further 
conclusion, namely, that instead of there being evidence in the case showing the 
publication required by law, there is evidence showing the precise contrary. 
</p>
<p>Let us remember that the first order of the court directing the committee to 
publish notice to creditors was issued <em>July 23, 1907</em>. It is conceded 
that publication <em>in a newspaper</em> of some sort was started<em> under that 
order.</em> But, the court, evidently becoming satisfied that, under all the 
circumstances, the publication under that order would not be sufficient to give 
creditors fair notice, on <em>January 8, 1908,</em> and before the publication 
under the first order, if there was ever started in reality a publication under 
that order, was completed, made a <em>second order of publication.</em> The 
reason for this order was evidently that, during the six months succeeding the 
date of the notice which it is claimed was published under the first order, 
three persons held the office of executor, the complexion of the committee 
itself was changed, and the member of the committee at whose house the notice 
required the claims and vouchers to be presented resigned from the committee 
and<em> became the attorney for the estate.</em> Pedro Abad Santos having ceased 
to be a member of the committee and having become attorney for the estate, and 
the notice to the creditors requiring that claims With their vouchers be 
presented <em>at his house,</em> there was no longer a proper place designated 
where creditors could present their claims. Furthermore, the continual change in 
the executorship already noted may have resulted in grave prejudice to the 
estate if the estate were to be held responsible for all claims presented during 
the time those changes were taking place, it being the duty of the executor, 
under the law, to be present at the hearing on claims and defend the estate 
against those which he deemed unjust, and the frequent change in the office, 
thereby bringing in persons unfamiliar with what had gone before, certainly not 
tending to efficiency.</p>
<p>All these facts, taken in connection with the defectiveness of the affidavit 
of the publication of the notice, and the fact that there was no posting of the 
notices as required by law, that the notice itself was defective in that it 
required the claims to be presented within six months from the <em>date of the 
notice</em> instead of the <em>date of the last publication</em> thereof, as the 
law, properly interpreted, requires, all these facts, I say, undoubtedly led the 
court to believe that the previous proceedings relative to claims should be 
annulled and that a new order of publication should be made. Accordingly, on 
January 8, 1908, as aforesaid, an order was made and entered as above set forth, 
requiring a <em>new publication</em> by a <em>new committee.</em> This order had 
the effect, of course, of vacating and annulling the previous order covering the 
same subject matter.<br><br><em>It is undisputed that no publication has ever 
been made or even attempted under this order of January 8,1908.</em> The only 
publication referred to in the record or in the opinion in this case is that 
under the order of <em>July 23, 1907. </em>No one contends that any other 
publication has ever been made or attempted.</p>
<p>That this order of January 8, 1908, was considered the governing order in the 
case and that it was an annullment of all prior proceedings and orders relative 
to the same subject matter, is clear. If notice had been given as provided by 
that order, the six months' term, according to the order, would have expired 
some time in July, 1908. This, of course, was clearly understood by the court, 
and we find the court, ever anxious to have the estate settled as quickly as 
possible under the law, making the following order on the the 2d day of April, 
1908:</p>
<p>"It is hereby ordered that the administratrix present her inventory before 
the 1st day of May and the committee its report within the time provided by law, 
and that the administratrix present her account before the 1st day of August, 
1908."'</p>
<p>This order demonstrates conclusively that the court believed that the 
committee was giving the notice to creditors as provided by the order of 
<em>January 8, 1908,</em> and not that of July 23, 1907; for, if the notice was 
to be given under the latter and the publication began July 25, 1907, then the 
time within which the committee was to report expired in January, 1908 (see 
opinion), long before the order of April 2, 1908, was issued (Code Civ. Proc, 
sec. 693) and the requirement therein that the committee report "within the time 
provided by law" was idle. The court evidently believed that notice was being 
published under the order of January 8, 1908, that the six months' period would 
expire in July, that the committee could therefore report to the administratrix 
the number and amounts of the claims presented and allowed, and that she could, 
therefore, render her account before the 1st day of August, as in the order of 
April 2 required. This order is strictly inconsistent from every point of view 
with the idea that the order of July 23, 1907, was in force and that publication 
of the notice to creditors was proceeding thereunder.</p>
<p>I, therefore, say that the record demonstrates not only that the declaration 
of the court that "the record affirmatively shows that the committee did make 
the publications required by law" is without sufficient foundation in fact, but 
also that the contrary is true, namely, that no publication was ever made under 
the only order under which it could be legally made.</p>
<p>I contend, furthermore, that this proceeding is not an action against an 
executor to recover a debt against the estate of his testator. The decision of 
the court that it is an action and not being one of those which, under the Code, 
can be brought against an executor and must be dismissed for that reason is, in 
my judgment, erroneous. I do not understand how a motion to compel an executor 
to comply with the directions in a will can be called an action to recover a 
debt in the sense that such motion is prohibited by law.</p>
<p>Dealing with the second branch of the case, wherein the court holds that the 
debt should have been presented to a committee;</p>
<p>The proposition that a debt which is recognized by the highest possible 
authority, the debtor himself, in the most solemn instrument known to the law 
and the one whose provisions are the most sacredly carried out by the courts, 
his last will and testament, which debt the testator, in his will, expressly 
ordered his executor to pay to the creditor by name, must be presented to the 
committee for them to determine whether it is a valid claim and whether it ought 
to be paid, is a proposition which appeals neither to my reason nor my sense of 
justice. There is no statute expressly requiring such presentation. There is 
none which by necessary implication requires it. To bring such a debt within the 
law requiring presentation to the committee, interpretation and construction 
must be invoked to such an extent as to shock if not violate the ordinary canons 
applicable thereto. This is particularly true when such interpretation and 
construction are resorted to to deprive a creditor of a claim, the validity and 
justice of which is not only undisputed but unquestioned.</p>
<p>There is no provision of the Code of Civil Procedure <em>expressly</em> 
requiring the presentation of <em>any</em> claim to a committee. Provision is 
made for the appointment of a committee which is authorized to hear certain 
classes of claims but nowhere is there an express provision requiring a creditor 
to present his claim. There is, to be sure, a section which provides (sec. 695) 
that if a creditor fails to present his claim, if it is a certain kind of claim, 
within the time provided in the law, it will be barred. It is, therefore, 
gathered by implication that every creditor having a certain kind of claim must 
present it; but there is no provision <em>expressly</em> requiring it. Moreover, 
it must be carefully noted that only <em>certain</em> claims need to be 
presented to the committee and that only certain claims are barred provided they 
are not exhibited. Section 686 confers upon the committee whatever jurisdiction 
it may have with respect to the hearing of claims, apart from those upon which 
actions were begun against decedent in his lifetime. It provides that "they may 
try and decide upon claims, <em>which by law survive against executors or 
administrators,</em> except claims for the possession of or title to real 
estate;" and under section 695 only those claims are barred which are 
<em>"proper to be allowed by the committee."</em></p>
<p>We see then that the committee is authorized to take jurisdrction over those 
claims only which survive against an executor or administrator. The code does 
not define or declare "what claims survive against executors or administrators." 
It refers to certain <em>actions</em> which, having been commenced by the 
deceased in his lifetime, may be continued after his death fry his executor or 
administrator. It nowhere tells us "what claims survive against executors or 
administrators," or what claims are "proper to be allowed by the committee." We 
are unable to say, therefore, from the context of the Code itself what the 
authors thereof meant by the use of the phrases "claims which survive against 
executors or administrators" and which are "proper to be allowed by the 
committee." All that is clear is that it was the intention of the law to 
<em>restrict the jurisdiction</em> of the committee and keep it within certain 
limitations, and to that end used these limitative expressions. It should be 
noted, however, that these limitations refer to claims and have no reference to 
<em>actions</em> begun against the deceased before his death. The distinction 
made in the Code between claims and actions begun against the decedent during 
his lifetime, and the respective provisions referring to those two subjects, is 
entirely lost sight of in the decision of the court. This being so, the 
following reasoning found in the decision, based upon the failure to distinguish 
between claims and actions begun against deceased in his lifetime, involves a 
conclusion in no sense related to the premises from which it is deduced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Do plaintiff's Claims fall within any of these sections? They are described 
in the will as debts. There is nothing in the will to indicate that any or all 
of them are contingent claims, claims for the possession of or title to real 
property damages for injury to person or property, real or personal, or for the 
possession of specified articles of personal property. Nor is it asserted by the 
plaintiff that they do. The conclusion is that they were claims proper to be 
considered by the committee."</p></blockquote>
<p>That there is no necessary relation between these two subjects is apparent. 
That an action for "money, debt, or damages" begun against the decedent in his 
lifetime must, under section 700, be discontinued upon his death "and the claim 
embraced in such action may be presented to the committee, who shall allow the 
party prevailing the costs of such action to the time of its discontinuance," 
does not necessarily mean that such claim, if no action had been begun upon it, 
is one which must be exhibited to the committee. Whether an action begun against 
the decedent in his lifetime survives or does not survive, has no necessary 
relation with the necessity of presenting a claim to the committee. Would it be 
logical to argue that because an action begun against the deceased did not 
survive, the claim upon which it is based cannot, therefore, be presented to the 
committee, or that because an action begun against the deceased in his lifetime 
did survive, that, therefore, the claim upon which it was based could and must 
be presented to the committee? Assuredly not.</p>
<p>No general requirement that all claims must be presented to the committee 
appearing in the Code, and it affirmatively appearing that there was an 
intention to restrict the power of the committee in the hearing of claims, it 
necessarily follows that the conclusion reached by the court that <em>all</em> 
claims must be exhibited to the committee is a pure inference and one not at all 
warranted by the provisions of the Code or by the rules of interpretation and 
construction. To me it is a conclusion absolutely necessary from the language of 
sections 686 and 695 that not all claims need to be exhibited. By express 
language these sections restrict the committee to the hearing of such claims as 
survive against executors and administrators and only those are barred which are 
proper to be presented to the committee.</p>
<p>The answer to the question, does the claim at bar survive against executors 
or administrators, brings us to an exposition of the various fundamental errors 
made by the court in holding that the debt in question is one which must be 
presented to the committee. One of them is involved in the declaration that the 
debt in question is a claim within the meaning of the law. In cases such as this 
it is proper and necessary to make a distinction between a claim and a debt. A 
debt is a claim which has been favorably passed upon by the highest authority to 
which it can in law be submitted and has been declared to be a debt. A claim, on 
the other hand, is a debt in embryo. It is mere evidence of a debt and must pass 
through the process prescribed by law before it develops into what is properly 
called a debt. The debt in the case at bar never was a ,claim. By the act of the 
testator himself, it was raised to the dignity of a debt and it remains such and 
must be acted upon as such by the courts as well as by all others. It was by the 
testator selected from the mass of his obligations, which are correctly called 
claims, and treated to a process which developed it into a thing called a "debt" 
over which no committee has jurisdiction and with the due course of which it has 
no authority to interfere.</p>
<p>The second fundamental error, following naturally from the first, is found in 
the declaration of the court that the debt in question is a claim <em>which 
survives against the executor or administrator</em> and must, therefore, be 
exhibited to the committee. This error involves, in my humble opinion, a 
misunderstanding of the nature of a will and of the obligation which a direction 
in a will imposes upon all persons executing it. A will is the testator speaking 
after death. Its provisions have substantially the same force and effect in the 
probate court as if the testator stood before the court in full life making the 
declarations by word of mouth as they appear in the will. That was the special 
purpose of the law in the creation of the instrument known as the last will and 
testament. Men wished to speak after they were dead and the law, by the creation 
of that instrument, permitted them to do so. It is upon this theory and around 
this purpose that there has grown that body of the law which uniformly and 
universally declares that the words of the testator spoken in his will shall be 
sacredly attended by his executor and enforced by the court. It has been 
declared a fundamental maxim, the first greatest rule, the sovereign guide, the 
pole-star, in giving effect to a will, that the intention of the testator as 
expressed in the will shall be fully and punctually observed. If by the use of 
clear and unambiguous language he has made his meaning clear and certain, his 
will explains itself, and all that the court can do is to give it effect. All 
doubts must be resolved in favor of the testator's having meant just what he 
said. His purpose may seem unjust, unnatural or absurd to us; yet, to refuse to 
execute it is to destroy it. As Chief Justice Marshall said; "The intent of the 
testator is the cardinal rule in the construction of wills; and if that intent 
can be clearly perceived, and is not contrary to some positive rule of law, it 
must prevail." (3 Peters, 346.)</p>
<p>The intention of the testator is said in a recent Virginia case to be "the 
life and soul of a will" and if this intention is clear it must govern with 
absolute sway. A will is not like a promissory note or a judgment or any other 
instrument which acknowledges or incorporates an obligation. Those instruments 
are mere <em>evidences</em> of the debt. A will is not, primarily, 
<em>evidence</em> of anything; it is the thing itself. It is not so much the 
<em>evidence</em> of what the testator did or intended to do; it is the testator 
himself. The court has failed in this case to distinguish between a will and a 
promissory note, or a mortgage, so far as their legal effects are concerned, and 
the statement which I made early in this opinion, that the court has given no 
legal significance whatever to the fact that the instrument in which this debt 
was acknowledged and in which it was ordered paid was a last will and testament, 
is literally true. It has given the testamentary directions of the testator no 
more force, effect or significance than it gives to the words of a promissory 
note or a mortgage.</p>
<p>The third fundamental error into which the decision has fallen is that it 
misconceives the duties of an executor and of a court relative to the provisions 
of a will. It is, of course, axiomatic that it is the duty of the executor, 
under the direction of the court, to carry out punctually and with the utmost 
care every provision of the will. That is why he is named "executor." He is an 
"executor" of a will because he "executes" the will. When he refuses or neglects 
to perform that function he ceases to be an executor and becomes a perverter or 
a destroyer. Section 640 provides that the estate of a decedent shall be 
disposed of according to his will and the bond to be given by an executor, 
prescribed in section 643, must contain a clause in which the executor agrees, 
and his bondsmen assure, that he will administer <em>"according to the will of 
the testator"</em> the estate which comes into his hands.</p>
<p>Under the provisions of this will it is as much the duty of the executor to 
pay the debt here in litigation as it is to pay a legacy bequeathed by that will 
or to carry out a devise found therein. Of course, as we shall see later, if it 
appear to the executor that the debt in suit was paid, in whole or in part, by 
the testator after he made his will, then, of course, he should refuse to pay 
the debt, in whole or in part, as the case may be. In such case his refusal to 
pay will not be a refusal to carry out the will, but will be grounded in the 
fact that the testator himself executed it prior to his demise. The proposition 
remains that the will must be executed; and the only excuse the executor can 
give for a refusal to execute it is that it has already been executed.</p>
<p>It is nowhere claimed in this case, and it cannot be, for no proceeding has 
reached far enough to involve the fact, that this debt has been paid, and 
nowhere in the record has its validity or binding force upon the estate been 
challenged or even disputed. That being the case, upon the facts, as they stand 
before us, there is no excuse which the executor or the court can now offer why 
the debt in suit has not been paid.</p>
<p>The fourth fundamental error into which the court has fallen in its decision 
is that it submits to the jurisdiction of a committee to hear claims the 
question of whether or not the provisions of a will are to be executed. This, 
although, it seems to me, is strange upon its face, is precisely what the court 
has, in effect, done in its decision; for, if a debt expressly acknowledged in 
the will and specifically ordered paid therein, must be submitted to a 
committee, it means that they may, in the exercise of their judgment, refuse its 
payment. This, in its turn, means that the provision of the will in relation 
thereto is annulled. By this process the Committee may, therefore, annul an 
express and mandatory provision of a will which is as binding as a provision 
giving a legacy or making a devise. It is to the probate court, and to it alone, 
that the law confides the power to annul and set aside provisions in wills. The 
executor himself may not do so. And the court itself may do so only after the 
very clearest demonstration that the provision violates a positive provision of 
law or is against the public policy of the state. In spite of this, it is the 
decision of this court that a committee of two or more persons, none of whom is 
a lawyer, none of whom may be even a business man, all of whom may be ignorant 
and inexperienced, may sit in an informal way, and with all the imperfections 
inherent in such a tribunal and the practice which governs its deliberations, 
may revoke a mandatory provision in the most solemn instrument known to the law. 
The bare statement of such a proposition is, it seems to me, its clearest 
refutation.</p>
<p>The fifth fundamental error into which the court has fallen follows 
naturally. As we have said, the decision gives no significance to the fact that 
the debt at bar appears acknowledged and legalized, in a last will and testament 
and that the testator therein solemnly ordered and directed his executor to pay 
it. Instead, the decision remands the creditor to the committee in exactly the 
same condition as any other creditor. He goes there with the burden of proof on 
him, with the necessity of establishing affirmatively and by a fair 
preponderance of the evidence the existence of the claim, the consideration 
therefor, and the fact that it has not been paid. There are laid upon him the 
restrictions and limitations imposed by section 383 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure, which stop his mouth as a witness under certain conditions. He is 
there with every burden, with every restriction upon him under which another 
creditor labors who has not a scrap of written evidence to support his claim. It 
is no adequate reply to say that he can put the will in evidence. He could do 
that with any other evidence that he might have. Moreover, that reply is a full 
admission of all that I have maintained, that the will is given no significance 
or value, <em>as such</em>, but is reduced to the mere function of being 
'evidence to be passed upon by the committee. Furthermore, it is incumbent upon 
him to prove that the claim has not been paid and this is the very point which 
may be the thing most difficult to establish; and it is in relation to this that 
the restrictions and limitations imposed by the section referred to produce 
their greatest effect. This certainly cannot be law. It cannot be that a 
creditor whose debt is recognized as is the one at bar occupies a position no 
different from that of a creditor whose debt is not so recognized. To contend 
the contrary, it seems to me, flies in the face not only of law and justice, but 
of common sense as well.</p>
<p>The fact that a debt is mentioned in the will as one not satisfied has, at 
least, the effect of changing the burden of proof from the creditor to the the 
estate. Instead of the creditor being required to establish the validity of the 
claim and the fact of nonpayment; it is incumbent upon the estate to show 
payment affirmatively. At the very least, recognition by the testator in his 
will should be given that much significance. The court does not even concede 
this. The provision before us, while not a provision for a legacy, has 
nevertheless the same force and effect; and as a legatee is not bound to show 
affirmatively his right to the legacy and as it is the duty of the executor to 
seek out the legatee and pay him the legacy, so it is not the duty of the 
creditor in this case to show affirmatively his right to the payment of the 
debt, but it is the duty of the executor, knowing nothing to the contrary, to 
seek out the creditor and pay him as the testator has ordered him to do. If he 
knows anything to the contrary the burden is on him to demonstrate it.</p>
<p>These considerations naturally lead us to the point so strongly urged in the 
decision, and which I regard, for the purpose urged, without force, that the 
debt may have been paid between the time of the making of the will and the death 
of the testator; and that, therefore, it ought not to be paid by the executor 
until the question of payment is properly determined. No one is disputing that 
proposition. But its admission does not at all mean that, to determine whether 
the Claim has been paid or not, it must be presented to the committee. If it is 
the duty of the court, through the executor, to see that the will is 
conscientiously executed, what more natural, if not absolutely necessary, than 
to submit to the court whether the provision recognizing a debt and ordering its 
payment should be carried out. What argument can be adduced, which does not fly 
squarely in the face of reason, to establish the proposition that a court has no 
business to determine whether a <em>particular</em> provision of a will shall be 
carried out or not, <em>when its supreme duty is to require the punctual and 
precise execution of the whole will? </em>How can it be maintained that, whether 
or not a <em>particular</em> provision in a will shall be carried out must be 
submitted not to the court, <em>which has exclusive jurisdiction of the whole 
will,</em> but to a committee of two or more ignorant and in experienced 
persons? If it is the duty of the court to see that the will is executed <em>as 
a whole,</em> then there must go with that duty the power to determine whether a 
particular provision ordering the payment of a specific debt shall be executed 
or not. But the determination of this question is the determination of the 
question of payment. Why take from the court, which is the sole body that has 
the power to determine whether provisions in wills shall be carried out, the 
determination of whether a debt recognized in a particular provision has or has 
not been paid and turn it over to a committee such as I have described?</p>
<p>It is thus seen that the proposition given so great weight in the decision, 
namely, that the debt should be submitted to the committee in order to determine 
whether it has been paid, is without point or force. The court could make that 
determination far better than a committee. The practice leading to the 
determination by a court as to whether or not a given provision in a will shall 
be carried out is very simple, much simpler than is the proceeding before a 
committee. The executor finding that the will orders him to pay a certain debt 
and having no knowledge of his own that such debt has already been paid, 
presents his final account to the court, in which he asserts that he is going to 
pay the debt in accordance with the provisions of the will. Notice is given to 
all parties interested in the estate. They appear. If they or any of them know 
of any reason why that provision of the will should not be carried out, they may 
manifest it. Upon that manifestation a hearing will be had and the court will 
determine whether or not the provision of the will has already been executed, in 
whole or in part, and upon that determination he will rest a judgment in which 
he will order the executor to carry out the provision of the will by the payment 
of the debt or he will declare that the provision has already been carried out 
by payment. What simpler than this and what more conducive to justice? Who can 
say that the submission of the same question to a committee is better than the 
submission to a court? It might as well be urged that the legalization of the 
will itself were better left to a committee than to a court; for, if whether or 
not the provisions of a will are to be carried out must be left to a committee, 
then whether it is a will at all or not may as well be left to the same 
authority. </p>
<p>The attempt of the court to meet the proposition that the will of the 
testator is the law of the case does not satisfy my judgment. It is claimed that 
the will of the testator is not the law of the case where it is in direct 
violation of a provision of law; and that the Code of Civil Procedure requiring 
that <em>all</em> claims shall be presented to the committee, the testator has 
no right to except a particular debt or any debt from the operation of the 
Code.</p>
<p>In the first place, the Code of Civil Procedure does not require that 
<em>all</em> claims shall be presented to the committee. It expressly limits the 
claims which must be exhibited. t In the second place, the claim that there is 
anything contradictory between the will of the testator in this particular case 
and the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure is, in my judgment, rather 
fanciful than real. What is the purpose of requiring the exhibition of a claim 
to a committee? Simply to save the estate from being defrauded. There is 
absolutely no other reason which is behind the law requiring such a 
presentation. Is it claimed that a debtor may not pay a claim during his 
lifetime? If not, and the will is but the testator speaking after death, may he 
not pay a debt in that manner? If the man who is the estate solemnly 
acknowledges a debt and offers to pay it, who shall say that the estate is 
defrauded if the debt be paid? And if the estate is not defrauded, neither the 
spirit nor the letter of the law which has for its object the protection of the 
estate has been violated or evaded, but has, on the contrary, been fully 
observed.</p>
<p>I do not discuss or express an opinion relative to the proposition that the 
statute of nonclaims runs against a provision of a will, or suggest the results 
which may follow such a doctrine.</p>
<p>The judgment should be reversed and the probate court ordered to hear 
petitioner's motion of the 21st of November and decide it upon the merits.</p>
