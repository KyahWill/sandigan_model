					}</style>The Attorney General in his brief filed in thin case on appeal recommends the 
acquittal of the defendant and appellant, on the ground that the evidence is not 
sufficient to sustain a conviction beyond a reasonable doubt.
<p>We agree with tha Attorney-General that the manifest contradictions and 
inconsistencies in tha testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution put in 
doubt the truth of some of the material facts as to which they testified, and 
that on the whole record a conviction cannot be maintained.</p>
<p>There can be no question that the husband of the complaining witness was 
enraged to a degree, as a result of the insistent demands of the accused for the 
payment of a debt which the accused claimed to be due him. This is shown by the 
undisputed fact that while the parties were discussing the alleged indebtedness, 
this man suddenly drew his bolo, rushed at his own dog which seemed to anger him 
by its loud barking, and killed it.</p>
<p>There seems to be no reason to doubt that the struggle described by the 
various witnesses occurred as this man was returning to the house after killing 
the dog, and we think that the weight of the evidence maintains the contentions 
of the accused that all that occurred thereafter was the result of the 
justifiable attempt on the part of the accused and his companions to disarm the 
infuriated man.</p>
<p>The complaining witness in attempting to aid her husband, and to prevent the 
accused from securing the weapon appears either to have slipped or fallen on the 
ground or to have been pushed over in the melee. In neither case do we think the 
accused can be held criminally responsible for the slight injuries she received 
as a result of the fall. Giving the accused the benefit of any doubt which may 
be raised by the conflicting testimony of the eye-witnesses, we are satisfied 
that there was a reasonable necessity for all that he did in his attempt to 
disarm the husband ofthe complaining witness.</p>
<p>The judgment entered in the court below, convicting and sentencing the 
accused should be reversed, and he should be acquitted and his bond exonerated, 
with the costs of both instances de oficio.</p>
<p>It is so ordered.</p></div>
