				G.R. No. 1056, May 16, 1903</h4>
				<H3>AGUEDA BENEDICTO, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. ESTEBAN DE LA RAMA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>LADD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Under section 144 of the Code of  Civil Procedure the filing of a bill of exceptions operates as a stay of execution. In  this ease, therefore, the order made by the trial court in the judgment for the payment of alimony for the period from the institution of the action to the date of such judgment was suspended by the filing of the defendant's bill of exceptions.   The  trial  court  might  undoubtedly, under section 144,  have provided that  execution should not be stayed as to  the order for the payment of alimony, but it did not do so.   The whole matter rested in the discretion of the trial court,  We have no jurisdiction  to take  any action in the premises.</p>
<p>Nor have we any jurisdiction to grant alimony pending the appeal.  The trial court might have made an order in such terms as to coyer the entire period till final judgment,  but did not do so.  We can not revise its  action, except as far as it is brought before us for revision in the ordinary manner,  by bill of exceptions.</p>
<p>The right of a wife to the payment of alimony from her husband stands upon no different footing from any other right created by the law or arising from contract or otherwise, and  is to be enforced  by  appropriate  proceedings commenced in the court having original jurisdiction.  Our jurisdiction in such cases is appellate merely.   (See Rieilly <em>vs</em>. Reilly, 60 Cal., 624.)</p>
<p>The motion must be denied.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J.,  Torres, Willard, Mapa,</em> and <em>McDonough, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
