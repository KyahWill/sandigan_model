				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Plaintiffs appeal from an order of the Court of First Instance of the city of 
Manila dismissing the action for want of prosecution.
<p align="center">STATEMENT OF THE CASE.</p>
<p>A statement of the case must be given up principally to the setting down of 
certain dates. Action was begun by complaint filed on January 21, 1916. The 
first averment was that plaintiffs are subjects of Great Britain and residents 
of London, England. The second averment was that defendant is a corporation 
existing under and by virtue of the laws in force in the British Colony of the 
Straits Settlements, duly authorized to do business in the Philippine Islands. 
Passing the other allegations not here of moment, judgment was asked for 
P11,050, with the corresponding interest alleged to be due. Defendants answered 
on March 13,1916. On July 15, 1916, the case was set for trial, upon the 
calendar of the Court of First Instance of Manila, on August 22, 1916. On said 
July 15, 1916, the parties agreed that the trial of the action be continued 
without date, to be again set for trial by the court only upon the request of 
one of the parties. The grounds for this agreement were: (<em>a</em>) That the 
trial required the depositions of witnesses to be taken in foreign countries; 
and (<em>b</em>) that there were hopes and expectations of an extrajudicial 
adjustment and settlement of accounts between the parties. On July 17, 1916, 
this stipulation was approved by the trial court. Thereafter, without the 
request of either party, the case was assigned for hearing on December 20, 1916. 
The day previous, December 19, 1916, plaintiffs presented the following 
petition, agreed to by attorneys for defendant, to the court:</p>
<p>"Now come the plaintiffs in the above entitled cause and respectfully 
represent to this Honorable Court that inasmuch as they are at present 
negotiating with the liquidator of the defendant firm, at Singapore, Straits 
Settlements, for the payment of the claim herein sued upon, they respectfully 
request that the hearing of this case be continued to some future day, to be 
determined by the court at the request of the parties or either of them; that by 
reason of the continued pendency of the said negotiations, plaintiffs herein 
have refrained from taking depositions abroad which will be necessary to enable 
them to make proof of their causes of action against defendant herein."</p>
<p>The trial court in an order of December 20, 1916, dismissed the case without 
express finding as to costs, reserving to plaintiffs the right to present a new 
action. In this order the facts were related and the statement was made that the 
cause had already been suspended for five months, the necessity was mentioned of 
making an annual report to the Secretary of Finance and Justice, and it was 
emphasized that it was not well for cases to lie dormant without prosecution. To 
this order plaintiffs excepted, perfected a bill of exceptions, and now bring 
the question of the propriety of the order before this court by various 
assignments of error.</p>
<p align="center">DECISION.</p>
<p>Courts have an inherent right to dismiss a suit fpr failure to prosecute it 
with due diligence. The Code of Civil Procedure of these Islands puts this 
principle in statutory form when in section 127 it is provided that an action 
may be dismissed with costs to the defendant in either of four specific cases. 
Case No. 3 is "by the court, when the plaintiff fails, for an unreasonable 
length of time, to prosecute his action."</p>
<p>An order of a court, in pursuance of an inherent and a statutory power, 
dismissing an action for want of prosecution, will not be reversed by the 
appellate court unless there has been an abuse of discretion. Every presumption 
is in favor of the correctness of the court's action. It is incumbent on the 
appellant to establish affirmatively that there has been an abuse of discretion 
by the trial court. Of course, each case must be determined upon its own 
peculiar circumstances. (Grigsby <em>vs</em>. Napa County [1869], 36 Cal., 585. 
<em>See also</em> Kerr's California Code of Civil Procedure, sec. 581, and 
annotations.)</p>
<p>The only question before us, therefore, is whether or not the court abused 
its discretion in dismissing the action for laches.</p>
<p>The object in view by the judge was most commendable. His wish was to clear 
the calendar of cases in which there had been a failure to prosecute for an 
unreasonable length of time. The court seized upon the opportunity which the 
approach of a new year furnished to determine why certain cases were still 
pending and to dismiss those whose prosecution had been virtually abandoned. The 
reason behind such a mandatory order is obvious, for without such a periodic 
judicial "house cleaning" attorneys might capriciously fail to push their 
actions to judgment.</p>
<p>As to the one reason assigned in the petition relating to continuance without 
date, to the effect that the trial required the depositions of witnesses to be 
taken in foreign countries, it having been disclosed that the parties had made 
no effort to obtain such depositions, the cause could properly be dismissed for 
want of prosecution. (<em>See</em> Herbst <em>vs</em>. Keystone Driller Co. 
[1917], 163 N. Y. Supp., 831.)</p>
<p>The other reason for not proceeding contains two branches, both of which lead 
to the conclusion that the trial court made a mistake in dismissing the action. 
This ground was that there were hopes and expectations of an extra-judicial 
adjustment and settlement of accounts between the parties. An action should not 
be dismissed on a nonsuit, granted for want of prosecution, when the delay was 
caused by arrangements between the parties looking to a settlement. More 
important still, as it is asserted and not denied that the affairs of the 
defendant corporation are in process of liquidation in the courts of Singapore 
and, as this discloses, that the members of the corporation are subjects of an 
alien and enemy nation, one should not expect to apply the normal rules of 
pleading to a situation brought about through the abnormal upheaval of war. The 
"unreasonable length of time" mentioned by section 127 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure is not absolute, but relative. What would be an "unreasonable length 
of time," within the meaning of the Code section under peace conditions, would 
not necessarily be an "unreasonable length of time" under war conditions. While 
numerous cases can be found in which for a specific period of dormancy, as two, 
three, or four years, cases have been dismissed, such a classification would not 
be appropriate, when a war produces impossibility or impracticability of 
performance. Just as a foreign or international war will suspend the operation 
of the statute of limitations between the citizens of the countries at war so 
long as the war lasts, and just as the Federal Courts of the United States will 
suspend an action during the war when it is found that the plaintiff is an alien 
enemy, so should the courts permit litigants affected by the war, especially 
those who are mutually agreed, to continue an action for a period reasonable 
under the circumstances.</p>
<p>The order appealed from is reverse'd and the case shall be returned to the 
court from whence it came to be restored to the calendar of the court. No costs 
will be allowed either party in this instance. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Johnson, Araullo, Street</em>, and <em>Avance√±a, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p></div>
