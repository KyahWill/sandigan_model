				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On the 7th of September,  1906, Uy Piaoco, a Chinaman, filed a complaint against the sheriff of the Court of First Instance of Cebu, Sergio Osmeña, alleging that on or about the 24th of August of said year the judge of First Instance of said province issued a writ of preliminary attachment upon request of Martina Rodriguez, against the property of the Chinaman Dy-Siongco and Uy Chiam-Liong, by  reason of a  certain amount, due by the latter; and on the same date the  sheriff, the defendant  herein,  levied an attachment on the property belonging  to Uy  Piaoco,  the plaintiff, which existed in a store situated in Calle del Comercio, close to  that of Norte America, in the capital of  Cebu; during the whole of the time mentioned in the complaint, the above-named Dy-Siongeo and Uy Chiam-Liong had no interest  whatever  as owners in the said store or its contents.  The defendant, without authority from any court and  without any just  reason therefor, closed the aforesaid store owned by the plaintiff, and placed under custody the goods therein contained, and notwithstanding the fact that on the same date the  plaintiff filed  a proper claim  before the sheriff, the defendant herein, and asked the discharge of the goods that  had been  attached,  the said defendant, without any right whatever,  refused  to deliver the goods of the plaintiff, keeping them under custody, the store remaining closed up to this date.</p>
<p>The property that  was attached  consisted of the said store and a large assortment of goods valued at P15,000; it was further stated that prior to the attachment,  goods to the value of more than P10,000 were sold every month with a net profit of P1,500; and that in consequence  of the attachment the plaintiff, besides the value of the  goods, suffered  damages to the extent of P1,500 pr month; that on  the  13th  of August the said defendant, without  any right whatever under the attachment order, attached about three hundred bales of tobaccp, the property of the plaintiff, stored in the  town of Naga in  said province, said tobacco being valued at P1,700, and was not returned by the defendant in spite of the fact that a claim  was filed with him by the plaintiff, and the said Dy-Siongco and Uy Chiam-Liong never had any interest as owners in  the same. In consequence of the said attachments the plaintiff  suffered damages and  his credit in Cebu and in Manila  Avas ruined,  and he lost  the value of the attached goods which amounted to P15,000; he therefore asked that judgment be entered in his favor, and that the defendant be sentenced to replace him in the possession of the store, and of the tobacco and goods, as stated above, or otherwise to pay the value thereof amounting to P16,700, to pay the sum of P15,000 together with P1,500 monthly from the 24th of August, 1906, until such time as the store and the goods are returned  to him, and to pay the costs of the proceedings, and finally he  asked for any other remedy which the court might consider proper.</p>
<p>The defendant  in his answer  alleged that the contents of paragraphs 1 and 2 of the complaint were true,  as also the contents  of paragraph 2, which should be the third, regarding the issue  of the writ of attachment against the property of Uy Chiam-Liong  and Dy-Siongco on  the 24th of August; 1906, in  the civil case instituted against them by Martina Rodriguez;  but that it  was not true that the defendant had attached property belonging to the plaintiff since what had been seized by him in compliance with the order of the  court belonged to the said Uy Chiam-Liong and Dy-Siongco, it being also true that the defendant did not receive orders from any competent authority  to attach any property of the plaintiff, Uy Piaoco, and that he did not attach any property and goods belonging to the latter; that it  was true that  he refused to  deliver to  him  the attached property because he did not  believe  that it belonged to him but to the said  Uy Chiam-Liong. and  Dy-Siongco, and  further, because the defendant had  not been informed in a conclusive manner of the right upon which the plaintiff intended to base his title of ownership; that the contents of paragraph 5 of the complaint were true as to what the attached property consisted of, but not as to the value thereof, which should only be determined from the inventory made by the defendant, the allegations contained in paragraphs 6 and 8 of the complaint being denied; that it was  true that the defendant on the 13th of August, aforesaid, did attach 300 quintals of tobacco, but that it was not true that said  article was the property  of  the plaintiff becau.se it was owned exclusively by .Uy Chiam-Liong and Dy-Siongco, and for said reason he refused and still refuses to deliver the 300 quintals of tobacco to  the plaintiff, because the latter is not the owner of the same; he therefore asked  that the complaint be dismissed with costs against the plaintiff.</p>
<p>The evidence  adduced by both parties  having  been received at the trial  and some  of the documents exhibited attached to  the records, the books remaining in the possession of the clerk of the court because it was impossible to attach them to said records, it appears that on the 17th of  January, 1905,  the  Chinamen  Dy-Siongco and  Uy Chiam-Liong  and  Serafin  Uy  Piaoco appeared  before Martin M. Levering, a notary public in Cebu, and produced a  document said to be a contract of sale, entered into between  the two first  named  and the third party, of  all the goods, merchandise, and furniture owned by Dy-Siongco and Uy Chiam-Liong, who were indebted to Uy Piaoco in the sum  of P39,752.25, made out in  favor of the creditor Uy Piaoco;  the said goods,  merchandise,  and furniture were deposited at the house of Joaquin Castro y Cia. in Calle del Comercio, Cebu, and were valued at P22,000; that the said debtors sold to their creditor a building lot situated in Calle  Magallanes, Cebu, valued at P5,000, and  to this purpose the  vendors executed the corresponding bill of sale before the  said  notary, which document, signed on the same  date,  is considered  as  a part  of the above-named agreement that  they also sold four hundred shares of the Yuen Sheng Company  of Manila, at  the rate of P100 per share, their  par value,  said shares appearing in the name of Uy Chiam-Liong, who paid P50  on account of  each share to said company, but Uy Chiam-Liong obtained from said company a loan of P10,000, mortgaging the said four hundred shares as security for the loan,  it having been agreed  that the present value of the shares  was P9,000; that the total value of all the property conveyed to the creditor was P36,752.25, and that in consideration of said transfer, the creditor, Uy  Piaoco, waived  the balance of the indebtedness, and the  contracting parties signed the document drawn out in duplicate  at Cebu,  on the date aforementioned.  Counsel for the defendant took exception to the filing of said bill of sale.</p>
<p>Counsel for the plaintiff offered in evidence, as Exhibit B, the inventory book, to which the lawyer of the defendant took exception, on the ground that the same had not been proven to be such inventory book because it was not signed by Uy Chiam-Liong and  Dy-Siongco.</p>
<p>Pages 38 and 39 of  the book,  Exhibit D, and page 25 of Exhibit F  were also  offered  as evidence of the accounts between Uy Chiam-Liong, Dy-Siongco,  and Uy Piaoco, which were likewise opposed and excepted to by the defendant on the ground that the  books referred to were not kept  in accordance with  the provisions of  the Code of Commerce.</p>
<p>A document marked as Exhibit J was also  offered in evidence, some of its pages having been signed  by the court, and to this the defendant also excepted because it was not a legal book and had not been identified.</p>
<p>In view of the above facts, judgment was rendered on the 23d of November, 1900, in favor of the plaintiff, holding therein  that the  property  attached  belonged to him by virtue of a valid  sale made to  him by the Chinamen Uy Chiam-Liong and Dy-Siongco, the court ordering that the bond of the plaintiff for the retention of the property held by him  be  set aside,  and that  the  said  plaintiff recover judgment against the defendant  for the absolute possession of said  property and  for the sum of P1,750  as damages, with interest thereon at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from  the 24th day  of November, 1906, and  the costs of the proceedings.</p>
<p>The above judgment was excepted to by the defendant, who gave notice of his intention to appeal to the Supreme Court and  also moved for a new trial on the ground that the findings  were openly and manifestly contrary to the weight of the evidence; the motion having been overruled, defendant excepted thereto and  upon approval of the bill of exceptions the same was submitted to this court.</p>
<p>The sale of the goods, merchandise, and furniture contained in the store established on the ground  floor of the house of Joaquin Castro y Cia. situated in Calle del Comercio, Cebu, made on the 17th of January, 1906, by the owners thereof, Uy Chiam-Liong and Dy-Siongco in favor of Uy Piaoco, was ratified before Martin M.  Levering, a notary public, and authenticated by him; said deed, which was executed by both parties, was not argued as false nor was any motion for the nullity of this sale made during the proceedings on the ground that  it was fraudulent, and that it had been made to the prejudice of the creditors  of the vendors.</p>
<p>In said deed the reasons which the vendors had for transferring the goods and furniture to Uy Piaoco, the creditor and purchaser, are stated, inasmuch as it is affirmed therein that the vendors were indebted to the purchaser in the sum of P39,752.25; that the total value of the property conveyed or assigned to said creditor was P36,352.25, and that the creditor waived the balance of his credit; it has not been proven in any manner that the debt was simulated, in order to be able to assume that the sale or assignment made to the creditor  was both fictitious and  fraudulent. Article 1111  of the Civil Code reads:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Creditors, after having attached  the property of which the debtor may be in possession, in order to  collect all that is due them, may exercise all the rights and actions of the latter for the same purpose,  excepting those inherent in his person; they may also impugn the acts which the debtor may have performed in fraud of their right."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In connection with fraudulent contracts,  article 1297 of said code provides:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Contracts by virtue of which the debtor alienates property, for a good consideration, are presumed to be executed in fraud of creditors.</p>
  <p>"Alienations for valuable considerations, made by persons against Avhom a condemnatory judgment, in any instance, has been previously rendered, or a writ of seizure of property  has been issued, shall also be presumed fraudulent."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The supreme court of Spain in  its decision of June 15, 1897,  when  applying  the above  last-cited article to an appeal in cassation, establishes the following doctrine:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The presumption that alienations are fraudulent, established by  said  article  (1297) may,, as  all  others, be destroyed by proof  to the contrary in  accordance with article 1251, and any judgment which may so establish it is not in violation of article 1248 nor of article 1291 of the Civil Code."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No evidence has been adduced to show in a satisfactory manner that Uy Chiam-Liong and  Dy-Siongco were within any of the  cases  stated in the foregoing  articles of the code; that they did not owe Uy Piaoco any amount;  that the contents  of the document marked as "Exhibit A" were untrue; and that the sale of  the  goods and furniture of the aforesaid store was  fictitious  and simulated.</p>
<p>The fact that a new license for the store was obtained on behalf of Uy Piaoco  from  the  municipal  treasurer on the same  day when the sale was made, and that a few days later Mr. Janssen, agent of the firm of  Behn, Meyer &amp; Co., importers,  was informed that Uy  Piaoc6 was the owner of the store and that he had taken  over the goods sold to the  former owners thereof, further  confirms the truth of the  sale made to the plaintiff.</p>
<p>So that when the said goods and  furniture were attached on the 24th.of August,  1906, at  the request of another creditor, Martina  Rodriguez, it was almost eight months since the articles attached had  no longer  belonged to Uy Chiam-Liong  and  Dy-Siongco, but to the  plaintiff, Uy Piaoco; therefore  the latter's attorney  in  fact performed his duty and exercised a perfect right when protesting against  the  attachment placed  thereon, and in asking the sheriff who carried out the proceeding to release the attached goods.</p>
<p>Was the affidavit filed by the attorney in fact  of the plaintiff affirming that the latter was the owner  of the property levied  upon, and not the debtors,  Uy  Chiam-Liong and Dy-Siongco, as presumed when the proceeding was executed, sufficient to support the claim and petition for dissolution, or was it necessary to prove the transfer of the dominion by producing the bill of sale marked as "Exhibit A"?   This question is  decided by  section 442 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which is of the  following tenor:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"<em>Right of third  party  against officer</em>.—If the property taken be claimed by any  other person than the defendant or his agent and such person make an affidavit of his title thereto or  right to the possession thereof,  stating the grounds of such right or title, and serves  the same upon the officer while he has  possession  of the property, the officer shall not be bound to keep the property under the attachment, unless the plaintiff, on demand of him, or his agent, indemnify the officer against such claim  by  an obligation  with two sufficient sureties; and no claim to such  property or  damage  for  its seizure by any  other person  than the defendant or his agent  shall be  valid against the officer  unless  so made,  but  nothing  herein contained shall prevent such third person from vindicating his claim to the property by any proper action."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Section 451  of the Code of Civil Procedure accords with the above.  Neither of  the above sections requires that the  title  of ownership .be produced or  exhibited, an affidavit of  his  title  thereto or  of his right  to the possession thereof being all that is necessary to be presented with his written  claim  to the sheriff  who levied the attachment.  Such requirements were undoubtedly complied  with by  the attorney in fact  of  the  plaintiff  as acknowledged by the defendant himself, and since by none of the sections cited above is the production of the title deed required,  the plaintiff's  attorney  in fact  was not bound to submit to the sheriff the bill of  sale marked  as "Exhibit. A," as claimed by the appellant  in his brief.</p>
<p>The writ of attachment issued by judicial order  was a legal procedure  in  execution of  said order; but from the time when the  agent of the owner of the seized goods filed a  written claim  protesting  against the attachment and justified his claim for the removal of the obstacle by means of an affidavit stating his title thereto or his right to the possession thereof and the grounds of his allegation, the defendant sheriff  should  have considered  the claim because in accordance with  the said section 442 he  was not bound to  maintain  the  attachment nor to  keep the property attached, in his possession.</p>
<p>According to the Code  of Civil Procedure the powers of the sheriff involve both discretional power and personal liability if he fails to  consider a  just claim based on the law, thereby  causing injury  to  a  third  person whose property is not subject to the responsibility of a debtor nor bound in favor of the creditor  who applied for the attachment.   It  is unnecessary  to produce  the  title to the property  claimed, which must  be  done in action of intervention,  and  the qualification  of  the validity  and efficiency of the title rests with the  judge.   It suffices to attach to  the written claim  filed  with  the sheriff  an affidavit of the title thereto or of the right to the possession thereof with  a statement  of the grounds  on which  the claim is based.</p>
<p>A third  party who  protests against  the  attachment of his  property and presents his claim in accordance with the provisions of sections 442 and  451 of  said Code of Civil Procedure is  entitled to  protection and to  be maintained in and restored to the possession of his said property, it not being permitted to deprive him  of the same unless by due process of law.</p>
<p>If, notwithstanding  a claim made in accordance with the law, a sheriff maintains the  attachment and refuses to dissolve it, he incurs, as a  matter of fact, the responsibility which the law determines because he then commits an act of dispossession or depriving of possession or an actual attempt against the right  of  ownership or possession, and violates the legal precepts in force which in  this connection are different from those of the former <em>Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil</em>;  and  the  person. who applied for the attachment must share  the responsibility therefor in case  he secured by a bond  the  responsibility contracted by the officer who executed  the attachment.</p>
<p>The defendant sheriff in disregarding the claim of the plaintiff's attorney in  fact  and maintaining the  attachment on the property of the said plaintiff, the same not being subject to the liability  of the Chinese debtors of Martina Rodriguez, has injured the said plaintiff by depriving him of the possession of his personal  property for about seventy-five  days,  and in  consequence thereof is bound to repair the injury caused, in accordance  with the provisions of article 1902 of the  Civil Code, which treats of obligations arising  from fault or negligence.</p>
<p>Considering that after the expiration  of seventy-five days  the attachment was removed  and tlie seized goods were  returned to the plaintiff; taking into  account that the value given  to the goods  was  P15,000,  the  average proceeds of the monthly sales that might have been obtained by said store had the same been  kept  open, the condition of things in this country including the Island of Cebu  even prior to 1906, and the existence of other similar stores in said city, it  is reasonably estimated that the total  amount  of the  loss suffered in consequence of the attachment  together  with  the  rental  for the premises and salary of clerks  amounts  only to  P300, which  sum in justice should be paid by the defendant, with interest thereon at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from the 24th of November,  1906.</p>
<p>With regard to the 300 quintals of tobacco seized in the town  of Naga in said  island, the record  does  not show the same to be the property  of the plaintiff, since beyond the fact that nothing is stated in Exhibit A in reference to said 300 quintals of tobacco, no satisfactory proof exists that they were acquired for account of the plaintiff.   On the contrary, it appears to have been conclusively proven that the 300 quintals of tobacco seized  were the property of the two Chinese debtors of Martina Rodriguez Uy Chiam-Liong  and  Dy-Siongco, and that,  therefore, the legal  representative of  Uy Piaoco, the plaintiff, had no legal right to request, the sheriff to remove the attachment on the tobacco in question because it did not belong to the plaintiff.</p>
<p>Section 297  of  the  Code  of Civil  Procedure, dealing on  the  affirmative allegations which each  party  must prove provides that:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Each party must prove his own affirmative allegations. Evidence need not be given in support of a negative allegation except when such negative allegation is an essential part of  the statement of the right or  title on which the cause of action  or defense is founded, nor even in  such case when the allegation is a  denial of  the  existence of a document, the custody of which  belongs to  the opposite party."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If in  accordance with the provision of the foregoing section the plaintiff complied with his  duty to prove that the goods and furniture of  the  store above  referred to were  his own  property, he  has not,  however, done so with  regard to  the 300 quintals  of tobacco, which are shown to belong to Uy Chiam-Liong and Dy-Siongco.</p>
<p>In view of the considerations above  set forth, it is our opinion, and we so hold, that the responsibility-contracted by the defendant,  Sergio Osmeña, as sheriff of the Province of  Cebu, is limited to  the  damage caused by the attachment  and retention of the goods and furniture of the store acquired  by the plaintiff on the 17th of January, 1906; therefore, the said defendant is hereby sentenced to pay the plaintiff, Uy Piaoco, as an indemnity, the sum of P900 "with interest thereon  at  the  rate of 6 per cent per annum from the 24th day of November, 1906, without any special ruling  as to costs, and the  judgment appealed from, thus modified, is hereby affirmed.  So ordered.</p>
