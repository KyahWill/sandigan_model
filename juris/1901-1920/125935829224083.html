				[ G. R. No. 1105, November 26, 1902</h4>
				<H3>IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF R. W. CARR ET AL. FOR A  WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> An application for a writ of <em>habeas corpus</em> having been presented to this court in behalf of R  W. Carr and three others, an order was directed  to whomsoever might have them in custody requiring such person  to show cause why the writ should not issue.   In pursuance of this order a captain of the Marine Corps appeared  and showed cause. It was  proved at the  hearing that these four men are marines in the service  of the  United States; that  it was alleged that they had committed an offense Avhich was in violation of the military laws and regulations by which that corps is governed, and that at the time the application for the writ was made they were in the guardhouse of the marines at Oavite by virtue of an order of the commanding officer of that corps  at that place.  These facts are sufficient to show that they are not illegally detained.</p>
<p> But it is claimed by  the petitioners  that the offense charged against them was a violation not only of the military law, but also of the civil law; that they had been arrested by the local police at Cavite on account thereof; that by reason of the insecurity of the local jail the civil authorities had transferred them to the Marine Corps; that they were being held by the latter awaiting trial by the civil authorities; that in the language of their counsel they were civil prisoners held  by the military arm, and that no warrant for their detention had  ever been issued. These facts do  not  make their  confinement  illegal. When  a soldier commits an offense which  makes him amenable both to  the  civil and military law he  can be tried by either.  (Coleman vs.  Tennessee, 97  U. S., 513; <em>ex parte</em> Mason, 105 U.  S., 696; Johnson vs. Sayre, 158 U. S., 115.)</p>
<p> If the military authorities have him in their possession they can turn him over to the civil courts for trial or they can try him themselves.  The fact that they have agreed to surrender him to the civil courts does not deprive them of jurisdiction to try him before such surrender.</p>
<p> The  marine authorities having jurisdiction to try the petitioners when this application  was made their  detention by such authorities was  not illegal.  (Carter vs. McClaughry, 183 U. S., 365.)</p>
<p> The  application  for  the  writ is denied, with costs  <em>de oficio.</em></p>
<p> <em> Arellano, C. J., Torres,</em> and <em>Mapa, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p> COOPER, J., <em>dissenting</em>:</p>
<p> I dissent.</p>
<p> SMITH,  J., <em>concurring</em>:</p>
<p> I am  of the opinion that the  petitioners had a right to make answer to the respondent's return to the order to show cause, and in case of a denial of all or any of the material allegations thereof to put the respondents to their proof.   In  view of  the  fact, however, that the petitioners did not ask leave or offer to  make any such answer, the facts alleged in the  return must be considered as admitted, and I therefore concur in the foregoing decision.</p>
