				<BR><STRONG>MAPA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>One afternoon, while the defendant was absent from his house, Domingo Alba Clemente entered  and proposed to the wife of the defendant that she have illicit intercourse with  him.  As  she refused to accede to  his desires he endeavored to rape her.   He seized her and was about to throw her on the ground when he was surprised by the defendant, who at that moment returned to the house and who rushed in upon hearing his wife's screams for help. Alba, upon seeing the defendant, turned on the woman and inflicted upon her  a serious wound in the right forearm with a bolo he was carrying and then immediately attacked the defendant,  wounding him in the breast.  A hand-to-hand  struggle  followed  between  them,  in the course of which the defendant succeeded in snatching the bolo from Alba's hands and with it inflicted upon him a wound from which he died shortly after.<br>
  <br>
Such are the facts established by the evidence in the record.  Upon them the court below held  the defendant to be guilty of  the crime of homicide,  and applying in his favor the mitigating circumstances of immediate provocation and of excitement sufficient to overcome reason and self-control, condemned him to six years and one  day of <em>prision mayor.</em></p>
<p>The court below was of the opinion that the complete defense of section 4 of article 8 of the Penal Code could not be applied, because,  "although it may  be  admitted," he says, "that the defendant acted  in self-defense, and that there was an unlawful  aggression without provocation on his part, nevertheless the reasonable necessity of the means employed to repel the aggression has not  been proven, because after the deceased was deprived of the weapon with which he made the attack he, the defendant, had no necessity to employ the weapon to ward off  the attack of his adversary."</p>
<p> We do not concur in this opinion of the court below. The deceased, having attacked the defendant and his wife with a bolo, and having wounded  both of them, and having made an  unsuccessful attempt, frustrated by the defendant, to rape the latter's  wife, and having  continued his aggression up to the point of commencing and maintaining a hand-to-hand struggle with the defendant, it can not be said that the latter exceeded  the limits of a just defense in wounding the aggressor iri the act with the same bolo with which  he had been attacked and wounded.  It does not appear that the struggle ceased after the weapon was taken from the aggressor.  Consequently it can  not be asserted that the danger to the defendant had ceased.  If the struggle continued the defendant might in turn  have been disarmed by the deceased  in  the course of the changing fortunes of  the  fight; in which case he would have been completely at the mercy of his adversary.  This was a contingency which  the accused  might  well have reasonably feared, more especially in view  of the fact that having received  a somewhat  serious wound in the breast which might  well, under these critical  circumstances, have appeared to him to be much more serious than it really was, he was in a disadvantageous position with respect to his adversary for a continuation of a prolonged hand-to-hand struggle.  This fear, added to the natural instinct of self- defense, strongly excited by this  fierce attack, must have instinctively  impelled him  to avail himself of the advantage momentarily thrown  in  his way by a  fortunate accident of the affray to put his aggressor <em>hors de combat</em> in the only way possible in the heat of the fight.  We can not require a man who finds himself so forcibly and persistently attacked as was the accused to  retain  the presence of mind necessary to pick and choose, and to employ some other less violent means, more especially  when we remember the natural rapidity with which the defense must necessarily be made if it is to produce the effect of repelling the aggressor.</p>
<p> For these reasons, there having been an  unlawful aggression  on the part of the deceased  without provocation  of any kind on the part of the accused, we are of the opinion that  his act in defense of his  person complies with all the conditions which in accordance with section 4, article  8, of the Penal  Code  wholly  exempt him from  criminal liability.</p>
<p> We therefore acquit the defendant and reverse the judgment below, with the costs of both instances <em>de oficio.</em>  So ordered.</p>
<p> <em>Arellano,  C. J,,  Torres, Cooper, Smith, Willard, </em>and <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
