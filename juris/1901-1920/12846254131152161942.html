<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The plaintiff brought the present action as sheriff of the Province of 
Pangasinan for the purpose of having determined who were entitled to the 
proceeds of a certain sale under several executions, of the property of Lim Kian 
and Lim Tiang Teng. The action was instituted by virtue of the provisions of 
section 120 of Act No. 190. The record shows that the property in question was 
sold under said executions to Simon Jangaon, a representative of the defendant 
and appellant Co Cang &amp; Co., for the sum of P685; that the costs incurred in 
said sale amounted to P207.05. The question is, Who is entitled to the balance 
of P477.95 among the several defendants?
<p>To the petition the various defendants answered each laying claim to the 
proceeds of said sale. Co Cang &amp; Co. answered the petition and alleged that 
they had obtained a judgment against the said Lim Kian and Lim Tiang Teng in the 
Court of First Instance of the City of Manila on the 29th day of September, 
1914, for the sum of P878.08; that said sum (P878.08) represented the price of 
goods, wares and merchandise sold to the defendants; that the goods attached 
under the said execution and sold were the same goods sold by them to the 
defendants Lim Kian and Lim Tiang Teng.</p>
<p>The defendants So Yengco, Doroteo Soratos, Jose S. Yok Peng, Dy He Chong, Co 
Chiongco, Yu Tivo &amp; Sons, Ong Pun, and Tan Yangco answered the petition and 
admitted all of the facts therein stated, except paragraph 10. Said paragraph 10 
of the petition simply alleged that the costs of the sheriff amounted to 
P207.05. Said defendants further alleged in their answer that each of them had 
obtained a judgment against the said Lim Kian and Lim Tiang Teng, while the 
other defendant Co Cang &amp; Co. had only obtained an attachment of the goods 
of said Lim Kian and Lim Tiang Teng. Said defendants further alleged that, by 
virtue of their having obtained a judgment against the said Lim Kian and Lim 
Tiang Teng, they had thereby obtained a preference over said Co Cang &amp; Co. 
by virtue of the provisions of article 1924 of the Civil Code, and cited a 
number of decisions in support of that contention in their answer.</p>
<p>Upon the issue thus presented the Hon. Julio Llorente rendered a judgment in 
which he ordered that the proceeds of said sale be divided among the defendants 
Jose S. Yok Peng, So Yengco and Doroteo Soratos, prorata, without any finding as 
to costs. From that decision the defendant Co Cang &amp; Co. appealed.</p>
<p>The pertinent facts necessary for a solution of the question presented may be 
stated as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. That a judgment was rendered in favor of So Yengco <em>vs</em>. Lim Tiang 
Teng for the sum P409.12, with interest and costs, on the 11th day of May, 1914, 
by the justice of the peace of the municipality of Tayug of the Province of 
Pangasinan.</p>
<p>2. That a judgment was rendered in favor of Doroteo Soratos <em>vs.</em> Lim 
Tiang Teng for the sum of P489.52, with interest and costs, on the 11th day of 
May, 1914, by the justice of the peace of the municipality of Tayug of the 
Province of Pangasinan.</p>
<p>3. That a judgment was rendered in favor of Dy He Chong <em>vs</em>. Lim 
Tiang Teng by the justice of the peace of the City of Manila for the sum of 
P606.12, with interest and costs, on the 19th day of May, 1914.</p>
<p>4. That a judgment was rendered in favor of Co Chiongco <em>vs</em>. Lim 
Tiang Teng by the justice of the peace of the City of Manila on the 19th day of 
May, 1914, for the sum of P604.12.</p>
<p>5. That a judgment was rendered in favor of Yu Tivo &amp; Sons <em>vs</em>. 
Lim Tiang Teng by the justice of the peace of the City of Manila on the 19th day 
of May, 1914, for the sum of P507.12, with interest and costs.</p>
<p>6. That another judgment was rendered in favor of Co Chiongco <em>vs</em>. 
Lim Tiang Teng by the justice of the peace of the City of Manila on the 19th day 
of May, 1914, for the sum of P605.12, with interest and costs.</p>
<p>7. That a judgment was rendered in favor of Ong Pun <em>vs</em>. Lim Tiang 
Teng by the justice of the peace of the City of Manila on the 19th day of May, 
1914, for the sum of P486.14, with interest and costs.</p>
<p>8. That a judgment was rendered in favor of Tan Yangco <em>vs</em>. Lim Tiang 
Teng in the court of the justice of the peace of the City of Manila on the 19th 
day of May, 1914, for the sum of {599.16, together with interest and costs.</p>
<p>9. That another judgment was rendered in favor of Yu Tivo &amp; Sons 
<em>vs</em>. Lim Tiang Teng in the court of the justice of the peace of the City 
of Manila on the 19th day of May, 1914, for the sum of P564.32, together with 
interest and costs.</p>
<p>10. That a judgment was rendered in favor of Jose S. Yok Peng <em>vs</em>. 
Lim Tiang Teng in the court of the justice of the peace of the municipality of 
Tayug of the Province of Pangasinan on the 11th day of May, 1914, for the sum of 
P443.91, together with interest and costs.</p>
<p>11. That Co Cang &amp; Co. commenced an action in the Court of First Instance 
of the City of Manila on the 4th day of May, 1914, against the said Lim Kian and 
Lim Tiang Teng for the purpose of recovering the balance of an account amounting 
to P878.08; that an attachment was issued after the commencement of said action 
on the 7th or 8th day of May, 1914, and the goods, wares and merchandise of the 
defendants were duly attached and held until the 17th day of September, 1914; 
and that a judgment was finally rendered in said action on the 29th day of 
September, 1914, for the sum of P878.08, with interest and 
costs.</p></blockquote>
<p>That upon said various judgments executions were issued. The writs of 
execution in favor of So Yengco and the said Doroteo Soratos were received by 
the sheriff of the Province of Pangasinan on the 16th day of August, 1914, and 
the property of Lim Tiang Teng was attached. The writs of execution issued in 
favor of Dy He Chong, Co Chiongco, Yu Tivo &amp; Sons, Ong Pun and Tan Yangco 
were received by the sheriff of the Province of Pangasinan on the 14th day of 
September, 1914. The writ of execution which had been issued in favor of Jose S. 
Yok Peng was received by the sheriff of the Province of Pangasinan on the 17th 
day of September, 1914. All of said writs of execution had been received by the 
said sheriff, except the one in favor of Jose S. Yok Peng, before the time of 
the sale of the property in question. The property under said executions was 
sold upon the 14th day of September, 1914, to Simon Jangaon, a representative of 
Co Cang &amp; Co. for the sum of P685.</p>
<p>During the trial of the present case Co Cang, of the firm of Co Cang &amp; 
Co., declared as a witness and swore positively that the goods, wares and 
merchandise attached and sold by the sheriff of the Province of Pangasinan under 
the said various executions were the goods, wares and merchandise which his firm 
had sold to the said defendants in the said various actions mentioned above, and 
that they had not been paid for; and presented in substantiation of his 
declaration Exhibits C, A-4, and 2. The lower court divided the proceeds among 
Jose S. Yok Peng, So Yengco and Doroteo Soratos, upon the theory that because 
their judgments (11th day of May, 1914) antedated the judgments in favor of the 
other defendants, they had a preference over the other judgment creditors in 
accordance with article 1924 of the Civil Code.</p>
<p>The appellant Co Cang &amp; Co. alleges that the lower court committed an 
error in deciding that the right of preference among the various defendants 
depended upon the dates of their respective judgments, and that article 1924 of 
the Civil Code did not apply; that the court should have applied paragraph 1 of 
article 1922 of the Civil Code, for the reason that the goods, wares and 
merchandise attached on the various executions were the same goods, wares and 
merchandise which the appellant Co Cang &amp; Co. had sold to the common debtors 
Lim Kian and Lim Tiang Teng.</p>
<p>It will be remembered that Co Cang &amp; Co., as early as the 4th day of May, 
1914, commenced an action in the Court of First Instance of the City of Manila, 
and, in order to protect their rights, had all the goods in question attached on 
the 7th or 8th day of May, 1914; that the goods were held under said attachment 
until the time they were sold under the various executions above enumerated. 
While, perhaps, the attachment issued in favor of Co Cang &amp; Co. did not 
create a lien in their favor nor give them a preferred right over the other 
creditors, the fact that the goods so attached were the same goods which had 
been sold by the appellant to the common debtors and had not been paid for, said 
paragraph 1 of article 1922, gave them a preferred right.</p>
<p>Article 1922 provides, so far as it is applicable to the present case, that; 
"With respect to the specified personal property of the debtor, the following 
are preferred: 1. Credits for the construction, repair, preservation, or for the 
amount of the sale of personal property which may be in the possession of the 
debtor to the extent of the value of such property. * * *"</p>
<p>The record shows "that the amount of the personal property" was less than the 
amount still due Co Cang &amp; Co.; that the same property which had been sold 
by Co Cang &amp; Co. to the common debtors was found in the latter's possession 
and identified by Co Cang at the time of the execution sale. (Torres 
<em>vs</em>. Genato, 7 Phil. Rep., 204; Banco Español Filipino <em>vs</em>. 
Peterson, 7 Phil. Rep., 409; Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co. of Maryland <em>vs</em>. 
Wilson, 8 Phil. Rep., 51; Rubert &amp; Guamis <em>vs</em>. Luengo &amp; 
Martinez, 8 Phil. Rep., 554; C. Heinszen &amp; Co. <em>vs</em>. Peterson and 
First National Bank of Hawaii, 10 Phil. Rep., 339; International Banking 
Corporation <em>vs</em>. Corrales, 10 Phil. Rep., 435; McMicking <em>vs</em>. 
Tremoya, 14 Phil. Rep., 252; McMicking <em>vs</em>. Nubia Co Piaco, 24 Phil. 
Rep., 439.)</p>
<p>The proof shows clearly (<em>a</em>) that the money claimed by Co Cang &amp; 
Co. was due from the alleged debtors as the selling price of the property in 
question; (<em>b</em>) that the property was identified by Co Cang as the same 
property which had been sold to the debtor, and to recover the price of which 
the action had been brought; and (<em>c</em>) that the identical property had 
been found in the possession of the debtor.</p>
<p>The evidence adduced during the trial of the cause clearly establishes the 
right of preference on the part of Co Cang &amp; Co. over the other defendants 
to the net proceeds of said sale of P477.95.</p>
<p>Therefore, the judgment of the lower court is hereby revoked; and it is 
hereby ordered and decreed that a judgment be entered in favor of the appellant 
Co Cang &amp; Co. and against the plaintiff for the sum of P477.95, and without 
any finding as to costs. So ordered.</p><em>Arellano, C. J., Araullo, 
Street,</em> and <em>Malcolm, JJ.</em>, concur. <br><br><br>
<hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1">

<p>CARSON, J., concurring:</p>
<p>I concur. But I think it well to indicate that if the attachment of Co Cang 
&amp; Co. was valid, it in itself was sufficient to secure them in their claim 
to the proceeds of the sale of the attached property. In the case of Kuenzle 
&amp; Streiff <em>vs</em>. Villanueva; Ed. A. Keller &amp; Co. <em>vs</em>. 
Villanueva (14 Off. Gaz., 2201), we said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Attachment; Levy; Priorities Between Attachments and Other Liens or 
Claims</em>.—The issuance and levy of an attachment on specific property, real 
or personal, gives to the attaching creditor a lien, or a right to a preference 
in the nature of a lien with relation to such property, subject to all liens or 
statutory preferences by which such property is affected at the date of the 
levy, but superior to all liens and statutory preferences by which the property 
may be affected subsequent to the date of levy."</p></blockquote>
<p>But it is unnecessary to discuss any question as to the validity of the 
attachment, since Co Cang &amp; Co. would recover under article 1922 of the Code 
in any event.</p></div>
