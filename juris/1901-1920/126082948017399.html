				<BR><STRONG>TRACEY, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The parties to this controversy, who had been conducting a partnership as industrial partners without capital, contributed from its profits the sum of P807.28 as a fund toward the construction of a casco for use in  their business, to which they added P3,500, borrowed from Maria del Kosario, the wife  of  the defendant, Bartolome Inocencio, he being the managing partner.  It  is admitted that this total, a little over P4,300, was  the estimated cost of the casco, but in the progress of the work the defendant  found that it called for additional funds, which he advanced to the amount of P2,024.49.   It satisfactorily appears from the evidence that  this, amount  was necessary in order to complete the work undertaken.  Although it would seem1 that he failed to notify his  partners of the various items from time  to time going to make up  this sum, it is shown that the books where at all times open to their inspection, and that, being asked to examine them, they omitted to do so,  and that the plaintiff Juan  Agustin, representing all the partners,  was also  present at the construction of the casco, in charge of the practical work and cognizant of its needs and its progress.</p>
<p>The work done on the casco having been within the scope of the association  and necessary to carry out its express object, the borrowing of the money required to carry it on, with the acquiescence if not with  the affirmative consent of his associates, was not  outside the powers of the managing partner and constitutes a debt for which all the associates  are liable.</p>
<p>The note passed into the hands  of the defendant by reason of  the successive deaths  of his wife and of their only child, each without debts, and for the amount thereof he became a creditor, subject, however,  to the deduction therefrom  of his proportionate part of the indebtedness.</p>
<p>The trial court treated  his claim on this note, as well as the sum of P2,024.49 furnished  by him, as an addition to his capital in the firm,  rather than as a loan, and  this constitutes one  of  the grounds of error stated by the appellant.  We do not deem it necessary to pass upon  this objection, for the reason  that, considered as a loan,  this sum would place the defendant as a creditor in a stronger position  as against his associates  than if  regarded as a mere contribution to capital.  The error,  if it be an  error, is not, therefore, prejudicial  to the plaintiff, but is rather beneficial to him.   The respondent did not except to it.</p>
<p>Various small sums have been paid out of the  profits to some of the partners and  these were properly allowed in the judgment.</p>
<p>On the theory on which  the action was disposed of, the trial court committed no error in the computation of the various shares.</p>
<p>Of the four parties plaintiff, but one, Victor del Rosario, is interested in this appeal, which has been dismissed as to the others, and as to him the judgment of the trial  court must be affirmed, with costs of this instance.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C.  J.,  Torres,  Johnson,</em> and  <em>Willard, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
