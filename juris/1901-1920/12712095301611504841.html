				<H3>EMIGDIO UMALE ET AL., PLAINTIFFS AND APPELLEES, VS. ALVARO FERNANDEZ ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br><br>D E C I SI O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This appeal through a bill of exceptions was raised by counsel for the 
defendants from the judgment of June 10, 1912, whereby the Honorable Vicente 
Jocson, judge, ordered the latter to execute an instrument of redemption of the 
property in question in favor of the plaintiffs for the sum of P816.80, and 
directed that the fees of the notary attesting the instrument should be 
chargeable to the plaintiffs, and the costs of the suit to the defendants.
<p>On January 19, 1912, the plaintiffs Emigdio Umale, a widower, and Margarita, 
Tomasa and Miguel Umale, his children had by his wife. Juana Fernandez, now 
deceased, filed through an attorney a complaint against Alvaro Fernandez and 
Engracia Lavadia, alleging therein that, on April 13, 1905, the plaintiff 
Emigdio Umale and his wife, during her lifetime, sold to the defendant spouses 
under <em>pacto de retro</em> or right of repurchase, without fixing any period 
for the redemption, a parcel of land planted with about one hundred coconut 
trees, its boundaries being specified, situated in the pueblo of Pagsanjan, 
Laguna; that, although the price of the sale was in the beginning P600, it was 
subsequently increased to P816.80, on account of the plaintiffs' having received 
from the defendants various partial payments as an increase of the price; that, 
on June 12, 1909, the defendants, renouncing their right of having irrevocably 
acquired the ownership of the property sold under <em>pacto de retro</em>, owing 
to the lapse of the legal period of four years, granted to the plaintiffs an 
extension of time for its redemption and executed for this purpose the document 
in Tagalog, the translation of which is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I, Alvaro Fernandez, married, have issued this receipt in favor of Emigdio 
Umale as proof of our agreement concerning their coconut land which has been 
sold to us under <em>pacto de retro</em> and which they may redeem at any time 
they may have money of their own without borrowing it from another person. In 
witness whereof, I have signed hereunder, in Pagsanjan, on this date, June 12, 
1909."</p></blockquote>
<p>That, on or about November 9, 1911, the plaintiffs delivered to the 
defendants and the latter accepted the sum of P800, plaintiff Umale's own money, 
on account of the price of the redemption of the said property, and that, on or 
about the 11th of the same month, the plaintiffs delivered to the defendants and 
the latter accepted, on the same account, the sum of P18.80, plaintiff Umale's 
own money, which second delivery completed the total sum of the price of the 
purchase and sale, under right of redemption, of the property in question which 
was thereby resold to the plaintiffs who, pursuant to the agreement made, took 
possession of the said land so redeemed; and that the defendants not only had 
not, up to date, executed the instrument of redemption, but they were disturbing 
the plaintiffs in their possession of the redeemed property, by means of a 
complaint charging them with usurpation of possession, notwithstanding that the 
parties had stipulated the transfer of the possession of the said property to 
the plaintiffs, by virtue of the said redemption. The latter, therefore, prayed 
that the defendants be ordered to execute in favor of the plaintiffs the 
instrument of redemption of the said property, with the costs of the suit 
against the defendants.</p>
<p>The demurrer to the complaint was overruled by an order of February 12, 1912, 
an exception thereto was taken by the defendants, and the latter's counsel set 
forth in answer to the complaint: that he made a general denial of each and all 
of the allegations of the complaint, and, as a special defense, alleged that 
Emigdio Umale and his wife, Juana Fernandez, sold and conveyed to the defendants 
the disputed parcel of land, without any special stipulation as to the period 
for its redemption, and that the vendors did not avail themselves of their right 
of repurchase within the term allowed by law, wherefore the property in 
question, free of all charge and encumbrance, now belonged to the defendants. He 
therefore prayed that his clients be absolved from the complaint, with the costs 
against the plaintiffs.</p>
<p>After a hearing of the case and an examination of the parol and documentary 
evidence introduced by both parties, the court rendered the judgment 
aforementioned, to which counsel for the defendants excepted and asked for a 
rehearing and a reopening of the case. This motion was overruled, an exception 
was taken by the said counsel and, the proper bill of exceptions having been 
presented by him, the same was approved, certified, and forwarded to the clerk 
of this court, together with all the documents and other evidence in the 
case.<br><br>In this suit counsel for the plaintiffs seeks to have the court 
order the defendants to execute, in behalf of his clients, an instrument of 
resale of the property mentioned in the complaint, with the costs against the 
defendants. These latter alleged in their answer that, since the plaintiffs did 
not avail themselves of their right of redemption within the period fixed by 
law, the property in question now belongs to the defendants, and prayed that 
they be absolved from the complaint, with the costs against the plaintiffs.</p>
<p>After a careful examination of the issues raised in this suit by the 
litigating parties, all the Justices of this court unanimously agree that the 
judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with the costs against the 
appellants.</p>
<p>The majority of this court accept the findings of the trial court, as well as 
the findings that the plaintiffs¦¦ are entitled to redeem the property sold to 
the defendants under right of redemption and that the repurchase of the property 
in question was effected on the 9th and 11th of November, 1911, through the 
delivery by the plaintiffs to the defendants of the sum of P816.80 as the price 
of the redemption and of the property redeemed by the plaintiffs from the 
defendants.</p>
<p>Although the period of four years fixed, by law for the resale of the 
property in dispute had already expired on April 14, 1909, as the sale under 
right of repurchase was effected without stipulating any period for the 
redemption, wherefore, after the lapse of the four years prescribed by article 
1508 of the Civil Code, the defendant-vendees irrevocably acquired the ownership 
of the property sold, pursuant to the provisions of the succeeding article, 
1509, of the same code, for the reason that the vendors had not returned to the 
vendee the price of the sale or made the other payments specified in article 
1518 of the said code; yet inasmuch as the said spouses, the vendees, had 
renounced their right and one of them, the husband Alvaro Fernandez, had granted 
to the plaintiff-vendors the privilege of redeeming the property at any time, as 
appears from the document executed and signed by the said Fernandez on June 12, 
1909, Exhibit B inserted in the complaint, through the renewal of the period for 
redemption or the extension of the same, it must be held that the said period 
for redemption was still running, and that the vendors were entitled to redeem 
the property sold. It was under these premises that Emigdio Umale and his two 
children, Margarita and Miguel, the successors of their deceased mother, Juana 
Fernandez, delivered to Fernandez' wife the redemption price, P816.80, and, a 
few days afterwards, took charge and entered into the possession of the redeemed 
property, in accordance with the agreement made with her.</p>
<p>It is held that the granting of a new period, or the extension of that 
prescribed in article 1508 of the Civil Code, is valid and effective, as it is 
not contrary to any provision of law and because it sprang from the 
disinterestedness of the vendees and the desire to benefit the vendors, the 
redemptioners, for the reason that the deceased Juana Fernandez, Umale's wife 
and the other plaintiffs' mother, was a niece of the defendant Alvaro 
Fernandez.</p>
<p>In the absence of an express stipulation with regard to the period of 
redemption the purchaser, in the exercise of the freedom to make contracts that 
is possessed by all, has the power to extend the period allowed by law, provided 
that the new period stipulated does not exceed the ten years fixed by article 
1508 of the code. For nothing in this article prohibits an extension, by 
agreement, of the four years, which is the period prescribed by law in cases 
where, in sales with right of repurchase, no period for redemption has been 
fixed by the parties.</p>
<p>For the foregoing reasons, whereby the errors assigned to the judgment 
appealed from are deemed to have been refuted, the said judgment should be, as 
it is hereby, affirmed, with the costs against the appellants.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Johnson</em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em>Carson</em> and <em>Moreland, JJ.,</em> concur in the result.

<div align="center"><br><br><em>CONCURRING</em> 
<p></p></div>
<p><strong>TORRES, J.</strong></p>
<p>The undersigned concurs in the dispositive part of the preceding decision; 
but, with due respect for the opinion of the majority of his colleagues believes 
that this decision affirming the judgment appealed from should be rendered upon 
the following grounds:</p>
<p>Owing to the lapse of considerably more than the four years fixed by article 
1508 of the Civil Code for the redemption of the land referred to in the 
complaint, which was sold under a <em>pacto de retro,</em> wherein no period was 
stipulated between the parties for its repurchase, the ownership of the 
defendant-vendees became in fact consolidated by operation of law and as the 
absolute owners of the property they were enabled freely to dispose of the same 
in the lawful exercise of their right; in consequence, the plaintiff vendors 
were in no wise entitled to redeem the land sold, inasmuch as their right to 
demand the resale by virtue of the contract of April 13,1905, which fixed no 
period for such resale, expired on April 14, 1909.</p>
<p>This being the case the vendee and absolute owner of the land, Alvaro 
Fernandez, two months afterwards, to wit, on June 12th of the said year, made a 
new agreement with the plaintiff-vendor, Emigdio Umale, empowering him to 
repurchase the said land at any time, provided he should do so with money of his 
own and not borrowed from another, and for this purpose the document Exhibit B 
was executed, which was written in Tagalog and was inserted in the complaint, 
followed by its translation in Spanish.</p>
<p>When the defendant Fernandez executed this document on June 12, 1909, there 
had already elapsed considerably more than the four years fixed by the 
aforecited article 1508 of the code as being the period where none is stipulated 
by the contracting parties; therefore, at the time the agreement was made, no 
contract whatever under right of repurchase existed, nor did the vendors, who 
were the owners of the land, have any right at all to redeem it; that right had 
expired and the property sold had already passed into the absolute ownership of 
Alvaro Fernandez.</p>
<p>The latter, however, wished to return, convey, or resell the said land to its 
former owners, and his intention so to do is very evidently expressed in the 
document aforementioned. Indeed, Fernandez' wife, on the 9th and 11th of 
November, 1911, two years and some months after the execution of said document, 
received in two payments the sum of P816.80, the price of the land resold to the 
plaintiffs. Several days afterwards she delivered the land to them, and on the 
13th of November of the same year the defendant Fernandez forwarded from Manila 
to the plaintiff Emigdio Umale, residing in Pagsanjan, Laguna, a rough draft of 
the instrument for the purpose of execution and attestation thereof before a 
notary.</p>
<p>These acts, the acceptance of the price of the land, the sending of a rough 
draft of the instrument to be executed for the purpose of the resale, and the 
delivery of the price of the property to the new purchasers, its previous 
owners, evidently and unquestionably show that the positive intention of Alvaro 
Fernandez and his wife was to restore or resell the said land to its former 
owners, who, through the lapse of the legal period allowed for its redemption, 
had lost their right of ownership therein.</p>
<p>If afterwards the instrument, the rough draft of which had been made by 
Alvaro Fernandez, was not signed by the contracting parties, it was due to the 
fact that these latter could not agree upon the terms in which the instrument 
was to be drawn up, for Fernandez noted the absence therefrom of certain 
conditions contained in the rough draft, which were unacceptable to Emigdio 
Umale and his children, and, as Fernandez and his wife refused to sign the 
proposed instrument, it was afterwards returned, unsigned, to the plaintiffs, 
who appeared before the same notary and declared that they annulled the said 
notarial document and revoked the concessions therein made in behalf of the 
defendants, Alvaro Fernandez and Engracia Lavadia. (Exhibit C.)</p>
<p>Besides the foregoing, the best proof that it was the intention of the 
contracting parties to resell or sell anew the said land to those who were its 
owners, is certain clauses of the said instrument, the rough draft of which, as 
before stated, was made by the defendant Fernandez, which clauses set forth, 
among other things, that record is made of the fact that, as the plaintiffs had 
failed to redeem the land from 1906 to 1911, they were no longer entitled to do 
so, since the period fixed by law had expired; although, through steps taken by 
the plaintiffs, they had induced the spouses Alvaro Fernandez and Engracia 
Lavadia to return or resell to them the said land at the same price, but subject 
to the encumbrances and conditions therein contained.</p>
<p>These statements set forth in the said proposed instrument agree with the 
facts that the price of the sale was received by the wife of the defendant 
Fernandez and delivery of the land was made to the plaintiffs. It is therefore 
unquestionable that it was the intention of the defendants to return by means of 
a new sale the land acquired by the previous sale, and the words or phrases 
contained in the document Exhibit B which relate to the previous sale and to the 
right of redemption should be understood as omitted and they cannot in any wise 
affect the force and validity of the new contract for the redemption of the land 
by plaintiffs, on account of their being contrary to the explicit provisions of 
articles 1508 and 1509 of the Civil Code.</p>
<p>After the lapse of the period of four years fixed in article 1508, in default 
of an express stipulation relative to the said period, which began to run from 
the date of the contract, the contracting parties, who did not see fit to 
stipulate any definite date for the redemption, have no fight to extend the 
legal period that has already elapsed, nor to fix a new period for the exercise 
of the right of redemption which had already expired by operation of law and the 
failure of the vendors to comply with the obligation of refunding to the vendees 
the price of the sale, for the latter consequently irrevocably acquired the 
ownership of the land sold. If the vendees afterwards alienated and returned the 
property, they did so by virtue of another new contract of sale, independent and 
distinct from the previous one already terminated.</p>
<p>The intention of the contracting parties, with respect to the new sale 
covenanted between them, is evident and therefore should prevail over the words 
that seem to contradict it. Moreover, in order to judge the intention of the 
contracting parties, attention must principally be paid to their acts, 
contemporaneous and subsequent to the contract the contract should be construed 
in the sense most suitable to give it effect, and when it involves a valuable 
consideration any doubt should be decided in favor of the greatest reciprocity 
of interests. These rules of interpretation are found in the provisions 
contained in articles 1281, 1282, 1284, and 1289 of the Civil Code. The contract 
of new sale, covenanted, consummated, and executed by the parties thereto, 
should, therefore, be upheld and the defendants should be compelled to execute 
the instrument demanded by the plaintiffs.</p>
<p>For the foregoing reasons, whereby some of the errors assigned to the 
judgment appealed from are deemed to have been refuted, the said judgment should 
be affirmed, with the costs against the appellants, it being understood that the 
instrument to be executed is one of sale.</p>
