				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This appeal presents two important questions.
<p>First. Are movements of watches, imported from Switzerland into the United 
States, and there placed in cases and later imported to the Philippine Islands, 
subject to the payment of duty?</p>
<p>Second. Must the Collector of Customs pay interest on the amount of duty 
illegally collected, which has been paid under protest, when he is ordered by 
the courts to return the same?</p>
<p>The lower court answered each of these questions in the affirmative. From 
that conclusion the importer appealed.</p>
<p>The facts in the present case have been stipulated. (<em>See</em> Bill of 
Exceptions, pp. 3-9.) The important facts are: That the plaintiff imported into 
the Philippine Islands 48 bracelet watches from the United States; that the 
movements of all of said watches had been manufactured in Switzerland and 
imported into the United States; that two of the cases of said watches were like 
wise made in Switzerland and imported into the United States; that all of the 
rest of the cases, including the bracelets, were manufactured in the United 
States; that the movements were placed in said cases in the United States; that 
the watches (the cases, the movements and the bracelets) were imported into the 
Philippine Islands with the movements placed in said cases and with the 
bracelets attached.</p>
<p>The Collector of Customs assessed and collected duty upon said watches, 
including the cases, the movements and the bracelets. From that decision the 
plaintiff appealed to the Court of First Instance, and the case was submitted 
there upon a stipulation of facts. After hearing the respective parties and 
considering the facts, the Honorable James A. Ostrand, judge, rendered a 
decision confirming in part and reversing in part the order of the Collector of 
Customs. The lower court held that the 46 cases manufactured in the United 
States, as well as the 48 bracelets which had also been manufactured in the 
United States, should have been admitted free of duty. The court further held 
that the two cases and the 48 movements which had been manufactured in 
Switzerland and imported into the United States and then later into the 
Philippine Islands were subject to the payment of duty. The Collector of Customs 
collected 25 per cent duty on the value of the watches imported, including the 
cases, the movements and the bracelets.</p>
<p>The theory of the importer and appellant is that, inasmuch as the cases, 
movements and bracelets had been united in the United States, the result being a 
watch, it was therefore a manufactured product of the United States and should 
be admitted free of duty under the provisions of section 12 of the Act of 
Congress of 1909 (Par C. of section 4 of the Act of Congress of October 3, 
1913).</p>
<p>The theory of the Collector of Customs is that the mere placing of the 
imported movements in the cases and attaching the bracelets did not constitute 
the resulting article a manufacture in accordance with the legal definition of 
that term as there was not sufficient transformation of the component parts, and 
no new article resulted having a distinctive name, character and use.</p>
<p>The Collector of Customs, in his decision of May 7, 1915, based his 
conclusions upon the provisions of section 12 of the Philippine Tariff Law of 
1909. The fact that that law had been repealed by paragraph C of section 4 of 
the Act of Congress of October 3, 1913, seems to have been overlooked. While the 
important provisions of said section 12 were reenacted in said paragraph C of 
section 4, the latter contains some amendments to the former law. The 
amendments, however, in no way affect the result in the present case.</p>
<p>Section 12 of the Tariff Law of 1909 provides:</p>
<p>"That all articles, except rice, the growth, product, or manufacture of the 
United States and its possessions to which the customs tariff in force in the 
United States is applied and upon which no drawback of customs duties has been 
allowed therein, going into the Philippine Islands shall hereafter be admitted 
therein free of customs duty when the same are shipped directly from the country 
of origin to the country of destination: <em>Provided</em>, That direct shipment 
shall include in bond through foreign territory contiguous to the United States. 
Said articles shall be as originally packed without having been opened or in any 
manner changed in condition: <em>Provided, however</em>, That if such articles 
shall become unpacked while en route by accident, wreck, or other casuality, or 
so damaged as to necessitate their repacking, the same shall be admitted free of 
duty upon satisfactory proof that the unpacking occurred through accident, or 
necessity, and that the merchandise involved is the identical merchandise 
originally shipped from the United States, or its possessions as hereinbefore 
provided, and that its condition has not been changed except for such damage as 
may have been sustained."</p>
<p>Paragraph C of section 4 of the Tariff Law of October 3, 1913, provides:</p>
<p>"That there shall be levied, collected, and paid upon all articles coming 
into the United States from the Philippine Islands the rates of duty which are 
required to be levied, collected, and paid upon like articles imported from 
foreign countries: <em>Provided</em>, That all articles, the growth or product 
of or manufactured in the Philippine Islands from materials the growth or 
product of the Philippine Islands or of the United States, or of both, or which 
do not contain foreign materials to the value of more than 20 per centum of 
their total value, upon which no drawback of customs duties has been allowed 
therein, coming into the United States from the Philippine Islands shall 
hereafter be admitted free of duty: <em>Provided, however</em>, That in 
consideration of the exemptions aforesaid, all articles, the growth, product, or 
manufacture of the United States, upon which no drawback of customs duties has 
been allowed therein, shall be admitted to the Philippine Islands from the 
United States free of duty: <em>And provided further</em>, That the free 
admission, herein provided, of such articles, the growth, product, or 
manufacture of the 4 United States, into the Philippine Islands or of the 
growth, product, or manufacture, as hereinbefore defined, of the Philippine 
Islands into the United States, shall be conditioned upon the direct shipment 
thereof, under a through bill of lading, from the country of origin to the 
country of destination: <em>Provided</em>, That direct shipment shall include 
shipments in bond through foreign territory contiguous to the United States: 
<em>Provided, however</em>, That if such articles become unpacked while en route 
by accident, wreck, or other casuality, or so damaged as to necessitate their 
repacking, the same shall be admitted free of duty upon satisfactory proof that 
the unpacking occurred through accident or necessity and that the merchandise 
involved is the identical merchandise originally shipped from the United States 
or the Philippine Islands, as the case may be, and that its condition has not 
been changed except for such damage as may have been sustained: * * *"</p>
<p>There are further provisos with regard to internal revenue taxes. The final 
proviso of paragraph C is:</p>
<p>"* * * <em>And provided further</em>, That section thirteen of 'An Act to 
raise revenue for the Philippine Islands, and for other purposes,' approved 
August fifth, nineteen hundred and nine, is hereby repealed."</p>
<p>Paragraph S of section 4 is in part as follows:</p>
<p>"That, except as hereinafter provided, sections one to forty-two both 
inclusive, of an Act entitled 'An Act to provide revenue, equalize duties, and 
encourage the industries of the United States, and for other purposes,' approved 
August fifth, nineteen hundred and nine, and all Acts and parts of Acts 
inconsistent with the provisions of this Act, are hereby repealed. * * *"</p>
<p>Although, in the main, while there is no difference between the provisions of 
the Philippine Tariff Law of 1909 and that of 1913, yet we think that the latter 
law must be considered as having repealed the former. In reenacting the free 
trade from the United States to the Philippine Islands, Congress has placed such 
relation upon a new ground. Congress has declared in the Act of 1913 that the 
reason for allowing United States products to be admitted into the Philippine 
Islands is "in consideration of the right to import Philippine product into the 
United States free of duty."</p>
<p>The importer contends that the lower court erred in not deciding that the 
"bracelet watches" as a whole were of American manufacture, and hence exempt 
from duty. It argues that since the watch movements had already paid a duty of 
30 per cent upon their importation into the United States, they have in effect 
become American products by virtue of having been placed in cases of American 
manufacture and should therefore be exempt from duty. It further argues that the 
product—the bracelet watches—should be considered as a whole, as "bracelet 
watches" manufactured in the United States. In support of that contention it 
cites the case of Uy Chaco Sons <em>vs</em>. Collector of Customs (24 Phil. 
Rep., 548).</p>
<p>Before discussing the decision of this court in the case of Uy Chaco Sons, it 
is important to note just what merchandise imported from the United States are 
admitted free of duty into the Philippine Islands. Paragraph C above provides, 
among other things, that "all articles shall be admitted into the Philippine 
Islands from the United States free of duty, which are (<em>a</em>) of the 
growth, (<em>b</em>) the product, and (<em>c</em>) the manufacture of the United 
States, upon which no drawback of customs duties has been allowed therein (in 
the United States)." Therefore, when it is established that the merchandise in 
question is the growth, or the product or the manufacture of the United States, 
it must be admitted free of duty when it is established that no drawback of 
customs duties has been allowed in the United States. Certainly, the phrase 
"upon which <em>no</em> drawback of customs duties has been allowed" cannot 
apply to articles which are <em>wholly</em> of the product or manufacture of the 
United States. Certainly said phrase was not intended to be applied to articles 
"the growth or the product of the United States," because it is difficult to 
imagine a case when there could be a drawback of customs duties on such 
articles. The only case in which said phrase "drawback of customs duties," can 
be applied is when the product is a manufactured product of the United States, 
and then only when said manufactured product is composed of some article not of 
the growth or product of the United States. For example, in order to manufacture 
a particular article it becomes necessary for the manufacturer to import into 
the United States some of its component parts. In such case, when the 
manufacturer <em>exports</em> said manufactured article, he is entitled to a 
drawback of customs duties on the imported article which constituted an element 
of the manufactured article. We are here using the words "manufacturer" and 
"manufactured" in their technical sense. In our example, of course, if the 
exporter of such manufactured article recovers back the customs duties which he 
has paid, then the completed manufactured product is not admitted free of duty 
into the Philippine Islands. It is only when he does not ask for a repayment of 
the customs duties upon such .manufactured articles that they are admitted free 
of duty. Of course, if the imported component parts of the manufactured article 
is admitted free of duty into the United States, then there can be no drawback 
of customs duties, because none have been paid.</p>
<p>The phrase "when no drawback of customs duties has been allowed" only applies 
to articles "of the growth, product or manufacture of the United States." That 
being so, the fact that there has been no "drawback" does not make the 
particular article admissible into the Philippine Islands. It <em>must</em> be 
an article of the growth, product or manufacture of the United States. If those 
facts do not exist then the articles cannot be admitted into the Philippine 
Islands free of duty, even though such articles are imported directly from the 
United States. That being true, then the only question for solution is: Are said 
watches, the growth, product, or manufacture of the United States? The question 
is still further limited to the question whether the uniting of the cases, works 
and bracelets produced a manufactured article of the United States, there being 
no contention that they were the growth or product of the United States. If they 
are "manufactured articles of the United States" and no "drawback" duty has been 
paid, then they may be admitted free of duty. If they are not "manufactured 
articles of the United States," then they may not be admitted free of duty, even 
though no "drawback" has been allowed.</p>
<p>In the case of Uy Chaco Sons, <em>supra</em>, the importer claimed that white 
lead manufactured, in a bonded warehouse in the United States, from pig lead 
imported from Spain without the payment of duty was entitled to free entry into 
the Philippine Islands. It is admitted that the pig lead had been imported into 
the United States from Spain: that there was a duty upon the pig lead which had 
not been paid by the importer; that the pig lead was subjected to a process 
which resulted in the "white lead," in a bonded warehouse, and was exported from 
the United States to the Philippine Islands, from said bonded warehouse, without 
having paid the prescribed duty. The court held that the "white lead" was not 
exempt from the payment of duty as a "manufactured article of the United 
States." The effect of bringing the goods to the Philippine Islands through a 
bonded warehouse in the United States is the same as though the "white lead" had 
been brought to the Philippine Islands directly from Spain—the country from 
which it was originally exported to the United States. The fact that it was kept 
in a bonded warehouse from the time of its importation in the United States 
until the time it was exported to the Philippine Islands prevented it from 
becoming in any sense the product or manufacture of the United States. It had 
never become a part of the product or manufacture of the United States. Apart 
from the fact that it had undergone some chemical changes while it was in the 
bonded warehouse in the United States it is in exactly the same condition which 
it would have been in had it been exported directly "to the Philippine Islands 
from Spain. It is in no sense a manufactured article of the United States and 
was therefore properly subjected to the payment of duty.</p>
<p>In the present case it is admitted that all of the movements of the said 48 
watches and two of the cases had been imported into the United States and had 
paid the prescribed duty. It is admitted that the 46 movements were placed in 
the cases in the United States and later the 48 watches, as completed by the 
uniting of the cases, the movements and the bracelets, were imported into the 
Philippine Islands. No claim is made that any work or labor had been placed upon 
said movements or the said two cases except to place the movements in the cases 
after their importation into the United States. It is further admitted that no 
drawback of duties had been allowed. The first question, which presents itself 
in this relation is whether or not the bracelet watches, made as above 
indicated, constituted a manufactured article of the United States and fall 
within the provisions of the Tariff law above quoted and are therefore 
admissible free of duty into the Philippine Islands. The Collector of Customs 
held that the bracelet watches in question were not manufactured articles of the 
United States and were therefore not admissible free of duty into the Philippine 
Islands. His conclusions were modified by the lower court. The court held that 
the bracelets and the cases were manufactured articles of the United States and 
should have been admitted free of duty, but held that the movements were not a 
manufacture of the United States and should therefore be subjected to the 
payment of duty.</p>
<p>With reference to the question whether the watches were a manufacture of the 
United States we have held in many causes that, in order to constitute "a 
manufacture" under the Tariff Act, there must be in effect a transformation, in 
some way or other, of the article or articles before it will be held to be "a 
manufacture." (Castle Bros., Wolf &amp; Sons <em>vs</em>. McCoy, 21 Phil. Rep., 
300; Kuenzle &amp; Streiff <em>vs</em>. Collector of Customs, 32 Phil. Rep., 
510; State <em>vs</em>. American Sugar Refining Co., 51 La. Ann., 562; State 
<em>vs</em>. Eckendorf, 46 La. Ann., 131; Hartranft <em>vs</em>. Wiegmann, 121 
XJ. S., 609; Tide Water Oil Co. <em>vs</em>. United States, 171 U. S., 210.</p>
<p>The application of labor to an article, either by hand or by mechanism, does 
not make the article necessarily a manufactured article within the meaning of 
that term as used in the tariff law, unless the application of such labor is 
carried to such an extent that the article suffers a specific transformation and 
is changed into a new and different article, having a distinctive name, 
character or use. (United States <em>vs</em>. Semmer, 41 Fed. Rep., 324; 
Baumgarten <em>vs</em>. Magone, 50 Fed. Rep., 69; Tide Water Oil Co. 
<em>vs</em>. United States, 171 U. S., 210.)</p>
<p>Courts and lexicographers have differed in their definition of what 
constitutes a manufacture. The courts have been obliged to formulate definitions 
in order to give effect to the purpose of legislative enactments, while 
lexicographers have been free to define said terms upon the pure etymology of 
the words. Courts have been obliged to define the term in order to make it 
applicable to particular affairs. It is the duty of the court to give the Tariff 
Law a strict interpretation which will give force and effect to such law. The 
primary purpose of the law is to produce revenue. (Castle Bros., Wolf &amp; Sons 
<em>vs</em>. McCoy, 21 Phil. Rep., 300.)</p>
<p>The Attorney-General, Ramon Avanceña, in his brief says:</p>
<p>"It is difficult indeed to conceive of the process of reasoning which would 
lead one to conclude that the mere insertion of imported watch movements in 
American cases would convert them into American products; it would be just as 
reasonable to claim that imported unroasted, unground coffee could be put up in 
American gold cans and exported as American-grown coffee. If Swiss watch works 
could be imported free of duty into the Philippine Islands simply because they 
are in American cases what would prevent the immediate returning of the cases to 
America for the insertion of more works, and thus use the cases over and over 
again as a means of bringing dutiable foreign products into the Philippine 
Islands to avoid the payment of the tax? And if such a practice were to be 
permitted what would prevent the free importation into the Philippine Islands by 
American wholesale liquor dealers of imported beers, wines, etc., transferred 
from their original containers into American-made flasks, and the repeated 
return of those flasks to the United States to be refilled ? According to the 
argument of the plaintiff in this case, apparently all that would be necessary 
would be to make the value of the flasks exceed the value of the contents. The 
very purpose of tariff laws could thus be entirely defeated."</p>
<p>The lower court modified the decision of the Collector of Customs and held 
that a portion of the money paid by the importer should be returned to the 
importer together with 6 per cent interest per annum from the date of the 
original liquidation of said duties. While the Collector of Customs did not 
appeal from the decision of the lower court, he now asserts that that part of 
the judgment of the lower court in which interest was allowed was erroneous and 
should be modified. Inasmuch as the Collector of Customs did not appeal, we are 
not called upon directly to pass upon the legality of that part of the judgment. 
However, due to the importance of the question suggested by the Collector of 
Customs, we deem it advisable to call attention to the jurisprudence on that 
question.</p>
<p>It is a clearly established rule of law that a sovereign State is not liable 
to pay interest unless under statute or contract. That rule is settled by 
decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, in decisions of supreme 
courts of the various States and by the courts of England. (United States 
<em>vs</em>. Bayard, 127 U. S., 251; United States <em>vs</em>. State of North 
Carolina, 136 U. S., 211; State <em>vs</em>. Thompson, 36 Ohio St., 409; Carr 
<em>vs</em>. The State, <em>Ex rel</em>. Coetlosquet, 127 Ind., 204; <em>In 
re</em> Gosman, 17 Chancery Div., 771.)</p>
<p>While the sovereign State, in the absence of statute or contract, is not 
liable to pay interest, it has been held, however, that governmental agencies, 
whether individuals or boards, which have been given the power to sue and to 
defend suits may be compelled to pay interest upon their indebtedness even 
though the Government itself ultimately pays the indebtedness. Tax collectors 
are almost universally given the power to defend suits against them for illegal 
collection of taxes. It is usually provided that the person taxed may protest 
and appeal to the courts to have the question of the legality of the assessment 
determined. It is usually provided that when the courts determine that the 
assessment was illegal, the Government itself will refund the money, relieving 
the collector of personal liability. (<em>See</em> sec. 989, Revised Statutes of 
the United States.)</p>
<p>In the case of Erskine <em>vs</em>. Van Arsdale (15 Wall. [U. S.], 68-75), 
the Supreme Court of the United States held that—</p>
<p>"Taxes illegally assessed and paid may always be recovered back, if the 
collector understands from the payer that the taxes are regarded as illegal and 
that suit will be instituted to compel the refunding of them. * * * Where an 
illegal tax has been collected, the citizen who has paid it, and has been 
obliged to bring suit against the collector, is, we think, entitled to interest 
in the event of recovery, from the time of the illegal exaction." (<em>See 
also</em> Schell <em>vs</em>. Cockren, 107 U. S., 625; National Home 
<em>vs</em>. Parrish, 229 U. S., 496; White <em>vs</em>. Arthur, 10 Fed. Rep., 
80; McClain <em>vs</em>. Pennsylvania Company, 108 Fed. Rep., 618.)</p>
<p>In the case of National Home <em>vs</em>. Parrish (229 U. S., 496), the 
Supreme Court, discussing the question before us, said:</p>
<p>"It is quite true that the United States cannot be subjected to the payment 
of interest unless there be an authorized engagement to pay it or a statute 
permitting its recovery. (U. S. <em>Ex rel</em>. Angarica <em>vs</em>. Bayard, 
127 U. S., 251; U. S. <em>vs</em>. State of North Carolina, 136 U. S., 211.) But 
this exemption has never as yet been applied to subordinate governmental 
agencies. On the contrary, in suits against collectors to recover moneys 
illegally exacted as taxes and paid under protest, the settled rule is that 
interest is recoverable without any statute to that effect, and this although 
the judgment is not to be paid by the collector, but directly from the treasury. 
(Erskine <em>vs</em>. Van Arsdale, 15 Wall., [U. S.], 68-75; Redfield 
<em>vs</em>. Bartels, 139 U. S., 694.)"</p>
<p>Section 144 of the Internal Revenue Act of 1914 authorizes the Collector of 
Internal Revenue, in cases like the present, to pay out of public funds in his 
hands "any judgment, damages, or costs" recovered in an action brought against 
"any revenue officer" by reason of any act done in the performance of official 
duties. The "damages" for the wrongful exaction or withholding of money is the 
payment of interest at the legal rate. (Article 1108, Civil Code.)</p>
<p>In view of all of the foregoing, we see no reason for modifying the judgment 
of the lower court. The same is, therefore, hereby affirmed, with costs. So 
ordered.</p>
<p><em>Carson, Araullo, Street</em>, and <em>Malcolm, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J.</em>, concurs in the result.</p></div>
