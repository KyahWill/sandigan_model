				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The evidence of record fully sustains the material findings of fact as set out in the opinion of the trial judge, and leaves no room for reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the defendants and appellants of the crime&nbsp; of<i> asesinato</i> (assassination)&nbsp; with which they are charged&nbsp; in the information.<br><br>The appellants, Isidoro Alias, Benito&nbsp; Castro and Brigido Binis, together&nbsp; with Rufino Agnis and Pablo Camino, (as to whom the information was dismissed in the court below&nbsp; in&nbsp; order that they might be called upon to testify for the prosecution) went at a late hour of the night of the 24th of January, 1910, to&nbsp; a house wherein they surprised and&nbsp; captured Ponciano&nbsp; Miral,&nbsp; deceased.&nbsp; In obedience to&nbsp; orders given by Alias, Castro and&nbsp; Binis tied the prisoner's arms together.&nbsp; Alias, who was the moving spirit of the party, by whom it was organized,&nbsp; and under whose orders it&nbsp; operated, struck&nbsp; Miral with&nbsp; his fist&nbsp; and&nbsp; said to him: <i>"Tu has destruido nuestro&nbsp; hogar.&nbsp; No sabes que esta es mi casa?"&nbsp; </i> (You have destroyed our home.&nbsp; Don't you know that this is my house?)&nbsp; Thereafter by&nbsp; direction of Alias,&nbsp; Miral,&nbsp; still with&nbsp; his elbows&nbsp; tied behind his back, was led away some distance from the house by Castro, Binis and&nbsp; Agnis,&nbsp; Alias himself&nbsp; staying&nbsp; in the house with the woman who had been living there as the<i> querida</i> (paramour) of Miral, and&nbsp; who had formerly&nbsp; borne a similar relation to Alias but had deserted him to go&nbsp; to&nbsp; Miral.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just before the prisoner was led&nbsp; away from the&nbsp; house,&nbsp; Alias whispered something to Binis.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the party with the prisoner reached a deserted place&nbsp; in a tract of hemp land, in the barrio of Manaybanay&nbsp; in the municipality of Dagami, Castro suddenly struck&nbsp; the&nbsp; prisoner on the&nbsp; side of the&nbsp; head with a&nbsp; heavy club and felled him&nbsp; to the ground,&nbsp; where- upon&nbsp; Binis&nbsp; struck the prostrate man&nbsp; in the breast&nbsp; with a bolo,&nbsp; inflicting a fatal wound.&nbsp;&nbsp; Early on&nbsp; the following morning the&nbsp; corpse was&nbsp; buried in the&nbsp; barrio of Malirung by the murderers, still acting under the direction of Alias, who accompanied and assisted them on&nbsp; that occasion.<br><br>Upon these facts we think that the court properly found Alias,&nbsp; Castro, and Binis&nbsp; guilty of the crime of asesinato (murder in the first degree).&nbsp; The&nbsp; element of treachery undoubtedly marked the&nbsp; unlawful killing of the deceased, who was bound and defenseless when he was done to death by his aggressors.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Art. 10, Penal Code.)&nbsp; This qualifying circumstance brought the unlawful killing&nbsp; of the deceased under&nbsp; the&nbsp; definition&nbsp; of&nbsp; the crime&nbsp; of asesinato as defined and penalized in&nbsp; article 403 of the code.<br><br>The commission of the&nbsp; crime of <i>asesinato</i> (murder)&nbsp; was marked with two aggravating circumstances,&nbsp; in that it&nbsp; was done in the night&nbsp; and in a deserted&nbsp; place (art.&nbsp; 10,&nbsp; Penal Code), and no extenuating circumstances, except as to Binis, who appears&nbsp; to have been less than eighteen years of&nbsp; age (art. 85, Penal Code).<br><br>The penalty of&nbsp; death&nbsp; imposed by&nbsp; the trial&nbsp; court upon Alias and Castro should therefore be affirmed, that being the maximum penalty prescribed by&nbsp; the code for the offense of which they were guilty, but the penalty of death imposed by the&nbsp; trial&nbsp; court&nbsp; upon Binis must be reversed, the evidence disclosing, and the trial judge having expressly found that he was less than eighteen years&nbsp; of age at the time when the crime&nbsp; was committed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The penalty which should have been imposed&nbsp; upon him is the maximum degree of the "penalty&nbsp; immediately inferior" to&nbsp; that&nbsp; prescribed by the code for the crime of <i>asesinato</i> of which he&nbsp; was convicted, that is to say, the maximum degree of the penalty of from ten years and one day of <i>presidio mayor</i> to seventeen years and four months&nbsp; of <i>cadena temporal,</i> which is cadena temporal in its medium degree.<br><br>We therefore affirm the sentence of death together with the accessory penalties prescribed&nbsp; by law,&nbsp; imposed by&nbsp; the trial court upon the appellants, Isidoro Alias and Benito Castro, but reverse the sentence&nbsp; imposed by the trial court upon the appellant, Brigido Binis, and in&nbsp; lieu thereof we sentence him&nbsp; to&nbsp; 14 years, 8&nbsp; months and 1 day of<i> cadena temporal,</i>&nbsp; together with the accessory penalties&nbsp; prescribed by law, and to the payment to the heirs&nbsp; of the deceased of the sum&nbsp; of Pl,000.&nbsp; A proportionate&nbsp; share of the costs of this instance will be&nbsp; charged against each&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellants.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; so ordered.<br><br><i>&nbsp;Arellano,&nbsp; C. J., Moreland </i>and <i>Trent, JJ</i>., concur.<br><br><i>Mapa, J.,</i> dissents.<br></div>
