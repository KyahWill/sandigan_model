				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>There had been priests of the Roman Catholic Church in the pueblo of Lagonoy, in the Province  of  Ambos Camarines, since  1839.   On the 13th  of  January,  1869,  the church  and  convent  were  burned.   They   were  rebuilt between 1870 and  1873.  There Avas evidence that  this  was done by the  order of  the  provincial governor.   The labor necessary  for  this reconstruction  was performed by  the people of  the pueblo under the direction of the <em>cabezas de barangay</em>.  Under the law then in force, each man in the pueblo was required to work for the government, without compensation, for forty days every year.  The time spent in the reconstruction  of these buildings was counted as a part of the  forty days.  The material  necessary  was bought and paid for in part by the parish priest from the funds of the church and in part was donated by certain individuals of  the  pueblo.  After the completion  of the church it was  always administered, until November 14, 1902, by  a priest of the Roman Catholic Communion  and all  the  people  of  the pueblo  professed  that  faith  and belonged to that church.</p>
<p>The defendant, Ramirez, having been appointed by the plaintiff  parish priest, took possession of  the church on the 5th of July, 1901.  He administered it as such under the orders of his superiors until the 14th day of November, 1902.  His successor having been then appointed, the latter made a demand on  this defendant  for the delivery to  him of the church, convent, and cemetery, and the sacred ornaments, books, jewels, money,  and other property of the church.   The defendant, by a  written document of that date, refused  to make such delivery.  That document is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"At 7 o'clock last night I received through Father Agripino Pisino  your respected  order of the 12th  instant, wherein I am advised of the appointment of Father Pisino as acting parish priest of this town, and directed to turn over to him this parish and to report to you at the vicarage. In reply thereto, I have the  honor  to inform you  that the town of Lagonoy, in conjuntion with the parish priest thereof, has seen fit to sever connection with the Pope at Rome and his representatives in these Islands, and to  join the Filipino Church, the head of  which is at  Manila.  This resolution of the people was reduced to writing and triplicate copies made, of which I beg to inclose a copy herewith.</p>
  <p>"For this reason I regret to inform you that I am unable to obey your  said order by delivering to Father Agripino Pisino the parish property of Lagonoy which, as I understand it, is now outside of the control of the Pope and his representatives  in  these  Islands.  May  God  guard you many years.</p>
  <p>"Lagonoy, November 14, 1902.</p>
  <p align="right">(Signed)  "VICENTE RAMIREZ.</p>
  <p>"RT. REV. VICAR OF THIS DISTRICT."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The document, a  copy of which is referred to in this letter, is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="right">"Lagonoy, <em>November 9, 1902.</em></p>
  <p>"The municipality of this town and some of  its most prominent citizens having; learned through the papers from the capital of these Islands of the  constitution of the Filipino  National Church, separate from the control of  the Pope at Kome by reason of the fact that the latter has refused to either recognize or grant the rights to the Filipino  clergy which have many times been urged, and it appearing to us that the reasons advanced why such offices should be given to the  Filipino clergy are evidently well-founded, we have deemed it advisable to consult  with  the parish priest of this town as to  whether it would be advantageous to join the1 said Filipino Church  and to  separate from  the  control of  the Pope as long as  he continues to ignore the rights of the said Filipino clergy, under the conditions that there will be no change in the articles of faith, and that the sacraments and other dogmas will be recognized and particularly that of  the immaculate conception of the mother of our Lord.  But the moment the Pope at Kome recognizes and grants the rights heretofore denied to the Filipino clergy we will return to his control.  In view of this, and subject to this condition, the  reverend parish priest, together with the people of  the town,  unanimously join  in declaring that from this date  they separate themselves from the obedience and control of the Pope  and join the Filipino National  Church. This  assembly  and  the reverend parish priest have accordingly adopted this resolution  written in triplicate, and resolved to  send  a  copy thereof to  the civil  government of this province for  its information, and do sign the same  below.   Vicente Ramirez, Francisco Tsrael, Ambrosio  Bocon, Florentino Relloso, Macario P. Ledesma, Ceeilio Obias, ISalbino Imperial, Juan Prese√±ada,  Fernando  Pemlor, Mauricio  Torres, Adriano Sabater."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the meeting at which the resolution spoken of in this document was adopted, there were present about 100 persons  of  the pueblo.  There is testimony  in the case that the population of the  pueblo was at that time 9,000 and that all  but 20 of the  inhabitants were satisfied with the action there taken.  Although it is of no importance in the case, we are inclined to think  that  the testimony to this effect merely means that about 100  of the principal men of the town were in favor of the resolution and about HO of such principal men  were opposed  to it.  After the 14th of November, the defendant,  Kaniirez, continued in the possession of the church and other  property and administered the same under the directions of his superior, the <em>Obispo Maximo</em> of the Independent Filipino Church.   The rites and ceremonies and the manner of worship were the same after the 14th day of November as they were before, but the relations between the Roman Catholic Church and the defendant had been entirely severed.</p>
<p>In  January, 1904,  the plaintiff  brought this action against the defendant, Ramirez, alleging in his amended complaint that the Roman Catholic Church was the owner of the church building, the convent,  cemetery,  the books, money, and other property belonging thereto, and asking that it be restored to the possession thereof and that the defendant render an  account of the property which lie had received and which was retained  by him, and for  other relief.</p>
<p>The answer of the  defendant, Ramirez, in addition to a general denial of the allegations of the complaint, admitted that he was in the possession and administration of the property described therein with  the authority of the municipality of Lagonoy and of the inhabitants of the same, who were the lawful owners of the said property. After this answer had  been presented, and on the 1st day of November,  1904, the  municipality of Lagonoy filed  a petition asking that it  be allowed to intervene in the case and  join with  the defendant,  Ramirez, as a  defendant therein.  This petition having  been granted, the municipality on the 1st day of December filed an answer in which it alleged that the defendant, Kamirez,  was in  possession of the property  described in  the complaint  under tire authority and with  the  consent of the municipality of Lagonoy and that  such municipality was the owner thereof.</p>
<p>Plaintiff  answered  this complaint, or answer in intervention, and  the  case was tried and final judgment entered therein  in favor of  the plaintiff and against  the defendants.  The defendants then brought the case here by a bill of exceptions.</p>
<p>That the  person in  the actual possession of the  church and other property described in the complaint  is the defendant, Ramirez, is plainly established by the evidence. It does not appear that the municipality, as a  corporate body, ever took any action in reference to this matter until they presented their petition for intervention in this case. In fact, the witnesses  for the defense, when they speak of the ownership of the buildings, say they are owned by the people of the pueblo, and one witness, the president, said that the municipality as a corporation had  nothing whatever to do with the matter.  That  the resolution adopted on the 14th of November, and which has been quoted above, was not the action  of the municipality, as such, is apparent from  an inspection thereof.</p>
<p>The witnesses for the defense  speak of a delivery of the church by the people of the pueblo to the defendant, Ramirez,  but there is  no evidence in  the case  of  any such delivery.  Their testimony in regard to the delivery always refers  to  the  action taken on the  14th of November, a record of which appears  in the  document above quoted. It is apparent that the action then taken consisted simply in separating themselves from the Roman Catholic Church, and nothing is said therein in reference to  the material property then in the possession of the defendant, Ramirez. There are several grounds upon  which this  judgment must be affirmed:</p>
<p>(1)  As to the defendant, Ramirez, it appears that he took possession of the property as the servant or agent of the plaintiff.  The only right, which he had to the possession at the  time he took it, was the right which was given to him by the plaintiff, and he took possession under the agreement to return that possession whenever it should be demanded of him.  Under such circumstances he will not be allowed,  when the return of such  possession is demanded of him by the plaintiff, to say that the plaintiff is not the owner of the property and is not entitled to have it delivered  back to him.  The principle of law  that a tenant can not deny his landlord's title, which is  found in section 333, paragraph 2, of the Code of Civil Procedure, and also in the Spanish law, is applicable to a case of this kind.   An answer of  the defendant,  Ramirez, in  which he alleged that he  himself Avas the owner of the property at the time he received it from the plaintiff, or in  which he alleged that the pueblo was the owner of the property at that time, would constitute no defense.   There is  no claim made by him that since the delivery of the possession of the property to him by the plaintiff he has acquired the title thereto by other means, nor does he in his own behalf make any claim whatever either to the property or to the possession thereof.</p>
<p>(2)  The municipality of Lagonoy, in its answer, claims as such, to be the owner of the property.  As we have said before, the evidence shows that it never was in the physical possession of the property.  But  waiving  this point and assuming  that the possession of Ramirez, which he alleges in his answer is the possession of the municipality, gives the municipality the rights of a  possessor, the question still arises, Who has the  better right to the present possession of the property?  The plaintiff, in 1902, had been  in the lawful possession thereof for more than thirty  years and during all that time its possession had never  been questioned or disturbed.   That possession has been  taken away from it and it has  the right now to recover the possession from  the persons who  have so deprived it of  such possession, unless the  latter can show that they have a better right thereto. This was the proposition which was discussed and settled in  the  case of the Bishop of Cebu <em>vs</em>. Mangaron,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> No. 1748, decided June 1, 1906.   That decision holds that as against one who has been in  possession for the length of time the plaintiff has been in possession, and who has been deprived of his possession, and who  can not  produce any written  evidence of title, the  mere fact that the defendant  is in  possession  does not entitle  the defendant to retain that possession.   In order that he may continue in possession, lie  must show a better right thereto.</p>
<p>The evidence in this case does not show that the municipality lias, as sucli, any right whatever in the property in question.   It has produced no evidence of ownership.  Its claim of ownership is rested in its brief in this court upon the following propositions:  That the  property in question belonged prior to  the treaty of Paris to the Spanish Government; that by the treaty of Paris the ownership thereof passed  to the Government of the United States; that by section 1.2 of the  act of  Congress of July 1, 1902, such property was transferred  to the Government of the Philippine Islands, and that  by the circular of  that Government,  dated  November 11,  1902,  the ownership and  the right to the  possession of  this  property passed to  the municipality of Lagonoy.   If, for the purposes  of the argument, we should admit that the other  propositions  are true, there is no  evidence whatever  to support the last proposition, namely that  the  Government of the Philippine Islands has transferred the ownership of this church to the  municipality  of Lagonoy.   We have found no circular of the date above referred to.  The one of  February 10, 1903,  which is probably  the  one intended, contains nothing that indicates any such transfer.  As to the municipality of  Lagonoy, therefore,  it is very clear that it has neither title,  ownership, nor right to possession.</p>
<p>(3)  We  have said that it would have no such title or ownership even admitting that the Spanish  Government was the owner of the property and that it passed by the treaty  of Paris to the American Government.  But this assumption is not true.  As a matter of law, the Spanish Government at the time the treaty of peace was signed, was not the owner of this property, nor of any other property like it, situated in the Philippine Islands.</p>
<p>It does not admit of doubt that from the earliest times the parish  churches in the Philippine Islands were built by the Spanish Government.  Law 2, title1 2, book 1, of the Compilation of the Laws of the Indies is, in part, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Having  erected all  the churches,  cathedrals,   and parish houses of the Spaniards  and natives of our Indian possessions from their  discovery at the cost and expense of our  royal treasury,  and applied for their service  and maintenance the part  of  the tithes belonging'  to us by apostolic concession  according  to the division  we have made."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Law  3 of the same  title relates to  the construction of parochial churches such as the one in question.   That  law is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The parish  churches which may be erected in Spanish towns shall be  of durable and decent construction. Their cost shall be divided and paid in three parts: One by  our royal treasury, another by the residents and Indian <em>encomenderos</em> of the place where such churches are constructed, and the other part  by the Indians who abide there; and if within the limits of a city, village, or  place there should be any Indians incorporated to  our royal crown, we command that  for  our part there  be contributed the same amount as  the residents and <em>encomenderos</em>, respectively, contribute;  and the residents who have no Indians shall also contribute for this purpose in accordance with their stations and wealth, and that which is so given shall be deducted from  the  share the Indians should pay."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Law 11 of the same title is as  follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"We command that the part of the tithes which belongs to the fund  for the erection of churches shall be given to their superintendents  to be  extended for those  things necessary for these churches with the advice of the prelates and officials, and by their warrants, and not otherwise. And we request and charge the archbishops and bishops not to interfere in the collection and disbursement thereof, but to guard these structures."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Law 4, title 3, book 6, is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"In all  settlements, even though  the  Indians are few, there shall be erected a church where mass can be decently held, and it  shall have a door with a key, notwithstanding the fact that it be subject to or separate from  a parish."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not only were all the parish churches in the Philippines erected  by the King and under his  direction, but it was made  unlawful to erect a  church without  the  license of the King.  This provision  is contained in Law  2, title 6, book 1, which is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Whereas  it is our intention  to erect, institute, found, and maintain all cathedrals, parish churches, monasteries, votive hospitals, churches,  and religious and  pious establishments  where they are necessary for  the  teaching, propagation, and preaching of the doctrine of our sacred Roman Catholic faith, and to aid to this effect with our royal treasury whenever possible, and to receive information of such  places where they should be founded and are necessary, and the ecclesiastical patronage of all our Indies belonging to  us:</p>
  <p>"We command that there  shall not be erected, instituted, founded,  or  maintained  any  cathedral,  parish  church, monastery, hospital, or votive churches, or other pious or religious establishment without our express  permission as is provided in Law  1, title 2,  and Law 1, title 3, of this book, notwithstanding any permission heretofore given by our.viceroy or other ministers, which in  this respect  we revoke and make null, void,  and of no effect."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By agreement at an early  date between the Pope and the Crown of Spain,  all  tithes in the Indies were given by the former to the latter and the disposition made by  the King of the  fund thus created is indicated by Law 1, title 16, book 1, which is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Whereas the ecclesiastical tithes from the  Indies belong to us by  apostolic concessions of the supreme pontiffs, we command the officials of our royal treasury of  those provinces to collect and cause to be collected all tithes due and to become due from  the crops and flocks of  the  residents in the manner in which it  has been the custom to pay the same, and from these tithes the churches shall be provided with competent persons of good character  to serve them and with all ornaments and things which may be necessary for divine worship, to the end that these churches may be well served and  equipped, and we shall be informed of the provisions made, it pertaining to the worship of God, our Lord; this order shall  be observed where the contrary has not already been directed by us in connection with the erection of churches."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That the condition of things  existing by virtue of  the Laws of the Indies  was continued to the present time is indicated by the royal order of the 31st of January, 1856, and by the roya.1 order of  the 13th of August, 1876, both relating to the construction and repair of churches, there being authority for saying that the latter order was in force in the  Philippines.</p>
<p>This  church, and  other  churches similarly  situated in the Philippines, having been erected by the Spanish Government, and  under  its direction, the next question to be considered is,  To whom did these churches belong? Title 28 of the third <em>partida</em> is devoted to the ownership of things and, after  discussing what can be called  public property and what can be called private property, speaks, in Law 12, of  those  things  which are sacred, religious, or holy.   That law is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"LAW XII-HOW SACRED OR RELIGIOUS THINGS CAN NOT BE OWNED BY ANY PERSON.</p>
  <p>"No  sacred,  religious, or holy thing,  devoted to the service of God, can be the subject of ownership by any man, nor can it be considered  as included  in  his  property holdings.  Although  the priests  may  have such  things in their possession, yet they are not the owners thereof.  They hold them thus as guardians or servants, or because they have the care of the  same and serve God in or with them. Hence they were allowed to take from the revenues of the church and lands what was reasonably necessary for their support; the balance, belonging to God, was to be devoted to pious purposes, such as the feeding and clothing of the poor, (he support of orphans, the marrying of poor virgins to  prevent their becoming  evil women  because of their poverty, and for the redemption of captives and the repairing of the churches, and the buying of chalices, clothing, hooks, and others tilings which they might be in need of, and other similar charitable purposes."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And  then taking up  for consideration the  tirst of the classes  into which this law has divided these things,  it defines  in  Law  13, title  28,  third  <em>partida</em>,  consecrated things.   Thai law is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Sacred things, we say, are those which are  consecrated by  I he bishops, such as churches, the altars therein, crosses, chalices,  censers,  vestments, books, and all other things which are intended for the service of the church, and the title to  these tilings can not be alienated  except in certain specific cases as we have .already shown in the first <em>partida</em> of this book by the laws dealing with this  subject  We say further that even when1 a consecrated church is razed, the ground  upon which it  formerly stood shall  always be consecrated ground.  Jiut if any consecrated church should fall into the hands of the enemies of our faith  it shall there and then cease to be sacred as  long as the enemy has it  under control, although once recovered by the Christians, it will again become sacred, reverting to its condition before the enemy seized it and shall have all the rights and privileges formerly  belonging to it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That  the principles of the  <em>partidas</em> in reference  to churches still exist  is indicated by Sanchez Roman, whose work on the Civil Law contains the following statement:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"First Group.  <em>Spiritual and corporeal or ecclesiastical. </em>A<em>. Spiritual.</em>‚ÄîFrom early times distinction has been made by authors and by law between things governed by divine law, called divine, and those governed by human law, called human,  and although the former can not  be the subject of civil juridical relations, their  nature  and species should be ascertained either to identify them and exclude them from such relations or  because they furnish  a complete explanation of the foregoing tabulated statement, or finally because1 the laws of the <em>partidas</em> deal with them.</p>
  <p><em>"Divine things are those which  are  either directly  or indirectly established by God for his service and sanctification of men and which are governed by divine or canonical  laws.   This makes it  necessary  to  divide them into spiritual  tilings, which  are  those which have  a direct influence on the religious redemption of man such as the sacrament, prayers, fasts, indulgences, etc., and corporeal or ecclesiastical, which  are those means more or less direct for the proper religions salvation  of  man.</em></p>
  <p>"7. First Group.  <em>Divine things</em>.   B. <em>Corporeal or ecclesiastical things</em> (sacred,  religious,  holy, and  temporal belonging  to the  church).‚ÄîCorporeal  or  ecclesiastical things are so divided.</p>
  <p><em>"(a)  Sacred  things are those devoted to God, religion, and  worship in general,</em> such as temples, altars, ornaments, etc.   These things can not be alienated except for some1 pious purpose and in such cases as are provided for in the laws, according to  which their control pertains  to  the ecclesiastical  authorities, and in so far as their use  is concerned, to the believers and the clergy.   <em>(2 Dereeho Civil Espa√±ol</em>, Sanchez Koman, p. 480; 8 Manresa, Commentaries on the Spanish Civil Code, p. 030; 3 Alcubilla, <em>Diccionario de la Adininistracion Espa√±ola</em>, p.  480.)"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The partidas  defined minutely what things belonged  to the public in general and what belonged to private persons. In the first group churches are not named.  The  present Civil Code declares in article 338 that property is of public or private ownership.  Article  339, which defines  public property, is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Property of public ownership is‚Äî</p>
  <p>"1. That destined to the public use, such as roads, canals, rivers, torrents, ports,  and bridges  constructed  by the State, and banks, shores, roadsteads, and that of a similar character.</p>
  <p>"2. That belonging exclusively to the State without being for public use and which is destined to some public service, or to the development of the national wealth, such as walls, fortresses, and other works for the defense of the territory, and  mines, until their concession lias been granted."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The code also  defines the  property  of provinces and of pueblos, and  in  defining what property is of public use, article 344 declares as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Property for public use in provinces and in towns comprises the provincial and town roads,  the squares, streets, fountains, and public  waters, the promenades, and public works of general service supported  by the said  towns or provinces.</p>
  <p>"All other property possessed  by  either is  patrimonial, and shall lie governed by the  provisions of this code, unless otherwise prescribed in special laws."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be noticed that in neither one of these articles is any mention  made  of churches.  When the  Civil Code undertook to  define those things in a pueblo which were for the  common  use of the inhabitants  of the pueblo, or which belonged to the State, while it mentioned a great many other things, it did not mention churches.</p>
<p>It has been said that article 25 of  the Regulations for the Execution of the Mortgage Law indicates that churches belong to the State and are public property.   That article is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"There shall he exeepted  from the  record  required by article 2 of  the law:</p>
  <p>"First. Property which belongs exclusively to the eminent domain of the State, and which is for the use of all, such  as the shores of the sea,  islands, rivers and their borders,  wagon  roads,  and  roads of all  kinds,  with  the exception of railroads; streets, parks,  public promenades and commons of towns, provided they are not  lands  of common profit to  the inhabitants; walls of cities and parks,. ports, and roadsteads, and any other  analogous  property during the  time  they are in common and  general  use, always reserving the servitudes established by law on  the shores of the sea and borders of  navigable rivers.</p>
  <p>"Second.  Public  temples  dedicated to  the  Catholic faith."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A reading of this article shows that far from proving that churches belong  to the State  and  to  the  eminent domain  thereof, it proves the contrary, for,  if they had belonged to the  State, they  would have  been  included in the first paragraph instead of being placed  in a paragraph by themselves.</p>
<p>The truth is that, from the earliest  times down to the cession of the Philippines to the United States, churches and other consecrated objects were considered  outside of the commerce of man.  They were not public property, nor could  they be  subjects of private property in the sense that any private person could be the owner thereof.  They constituted a kind of property the distinctive characteristic of which  was that it was devoted to the worship of God.</p>
<p>But, being material things it  was necessary  that some one  should have the care and custody of  them and  the administration  thereof, and the question occurs, To whom, under the Spanish law, was intrusted that possession and administration?   For the purposes  of the  Spanish law there was only one religion.   That was the religion professed by  the Roman Catholic Church.  It was for  the purposes  of that  religion and for the observance of its rites that this church and all other churches in the Philippines were erected.  The  possession of  the churches, their care and custody, and the maintenance of religious worship therein were necessarily, therefore, intrusted  to that body. It was, by virtue of the laws of Spain, the only body which could under any circumstances have possession of, or any control over, any church dedicated to the worship of God.  By virtue of those laws this possession and right of  control  were  necessarily exclusive.   It is not necessary or important to give any name to this right of possession and  control exercised by the Roman Catholic Church in the church buildings of the Philippines prior to 1898.  It  is not necessary to show that the church as a juridical person was the owner of the buildings.   It  is sufficient to say that this right to the exclusive possession and control of the same, for  the purposes of its creation, existed.</p>
<p>The  right of  patronage, existing in the King of Spain with reference to the churches in the Philippines, did not give  him any right to interfere with  the  material possession of these buildings.</p>
<p>Title 6 of book 1 of the Compilation of the Laws of the of Indies treats  <em>Del Patronazgo Real de las Indias</em>.   There is nothing in any one of the fifty-one laws which compose this lille which in any way indicates that the King of Spain was the owner of the churches in the Indies because he had constructed them.   These  laws  relate to the right of presentation to ecclesiastical charges and offices.   For example, Law 49 of the title commences as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Because the patronage  and right of presentation of all  archbishops,  bishops,  dignitaries,  prebends, curates, and  doctrines and  all other beneficies and ecclesiastical offices whatsoever belong to us, no other person can obtain or possess  the same without, our presentation as provided in Law 1 and other laws of  this  title."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Title 15 of the first <em>partida</em> treats of the right of patronage  vesting in private jwrsons, but there is  nothing in any  one  of its fifteen laws which in any  way indicates that the private patron is the owner of  the church.</p>
<p>When  it is said  that  this church never belonged to the Crown of Spain,  it is  not  intended to  say that the Government  had no power over it.  It may be  that by virtue of that power of eminent domain which necessarily resides in  every  government,  it  might  have appropriated this church  and other churches, and private property of individuals,   lint nothing of this  kind was ever, attempted in the Philippines.</p>
<p>It,  therefore, follows that  in  1908, and  prior to  the frealy of  Paris, (he Woman Catholic Church had by law the exclusive  right to the  possession of  this church and it  had the legal right to administer the same for the purposes for which the building was consecrated.   It was then in lhe full and peaceful possession of the church  with the rights aforesaid.  That these rights were fully  protected by the treaty  of Paris is very clear.  That  treaty, in article S, provides, among other things, as  follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"And it  is hereby declared that  the relinquishment or cession, as the case  may  be, to which the preceding paragraph refers, can not in  any respect impair  the property or rights which by law belong to the peaceful possession of property  of all kinds, of  provinces, municipalities, public or private establishments, ecclesiastical or civic bodies, or any other associations having1 legal capacity to acquire and possess property in the aforesaid territories renounced or ceded, or of private individuals, of whatsoever nationality  such individuals may be."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is  not necessary, however,  to invoke the provisions of that treaty.   Neither the Government of the United States,  nor  the  Government of these Island.s,  lias ever attempted in any way to interfere with the rights which the Roman  Catholic  Church had in this building when  Spanish sovereignty ceased in the Philippines.  Any interference that has resulted has been caused by private individuals, acting  without   any  authority  from  the  Government. Against  such interference  by private persons  with  the rights of  others,  redress is given in the courts of justice without reference to the provisions of the treaty  of Paris.</p>
<p>No point is made in the  brief of the appellant  that any distinction should be made  between  the  church and  the convent.  The convent  undoubtedly was  annexed to  the church  and, as  to it,  the  provisions of Law 19, title 2, book 1, of the Compilation of the Laws of the Indies would apply.  That law is  as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"We command that the Indians of each town or barrio shall  construct such houses  as mav be deemed  sufficient in which  the priests  of  such towns or barrios  may live comfortably adjoining the parish church of the place where they may be built for the benefit of the priests in charge of such  churches and engaged in the education  and conversion  of their  Indian parishioners, and they shall not be alienated or devoted to any other purpose."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The evidence in this case makes  no showing in regard to the cemetery.   It  is always  mentioned in connection with the church and  convent and no point is made by the appellant that if the plaintiff is entitled to recover the possession of the church and convent, lie  is not also entitled to recover possession of the cemetery.   So, without discussing the question as to whether the rules applicable to churches are  in all respects  applicable to cemeteries, we hold  for the purpose of  this case that the plaintiff has the same right to the cemetery that he has to the church.</p>
<p>(4) It  is suggested  by the appellant that the Koman So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano,  C. J., Torres, Mapa,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<em>Johnson, J., </em>reserves his vote.<br>

<em>CONCURRING IN THE RESULT</em></div>
<p><strong>CARSON, J.:</strong></p>
<p>I am in entire accord with the majority of the court as to the disposition  of this case,  but I can not adopt the reasoning by which some  of the conclusions appear to have Catholic Church has no  legal personality  in  the  Philippine  Islands.  This suggestion,  made  with reference to an institution which antedates by almost a thousand years any other personality in Europe, and which existed "when Grecian  eloquence  still flourished in Antioch, and when idols  were still  worshiped in the temple  of Mecca,"' does not require  serious consideration.  In  the preamble to the budget relating to ecclesiastical obligations, presented by Montero Kios to the Cortes on the 1st of October, 1871, speaking of the Koman Catholic Church, he says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Persecuted as an unlawful association since the early days of its existence up to the time of (lalieno, who was the first of the  Koman emperors to admit it  among the juridical entities protected by the laws of the Empire, it existed until then bv the merer and will of the faithful and depended for such existence upon pious gifts and offerings.   Since  the latter half ot the third century, and more particularly since the year 313, when Constantine,  by the edict  of Milan,  inaugurated  an era  of protection  for the church, the latter gradually  entered upon the  exercise of such rights as were required  for the  acquisition, preservation, and transmission of  property the same as any other juridical entity  under the laws of  the Empire.  (3  Dictionary of Spanish Administration, Alcubilla, p. 211.  See also the royal order of  the 4th of December, 1890, 3 Alcubilla, 181).)"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The judgment of the  court below  is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against  the appellant.  After the expiration of twenty days from  the date hereof let judgment be entered in  accordance herewith, and ten days thereafter the record be remanded to the court belowT  for execution. been obtained, nor accept without reserve all of the propositions laid down in the majority opinion.</p>
<p>Profoundly as I respect the judgment of my associates, and distrustful as I  ought to be of my own, the transcendant importance of the issues involved seems to impose upon me the duty of  writing  a separate  opinion and stating therein as clearly as may be the precise grounds upon which I  base my assent and the reasons which  forbid my acceptance of the majority opinion in its entirety.</p>
<p>I accept the argument and authority of  the opinion of the court in so far as it finds: That the Roman Catholic Church is a juridical entity in the Philippine Islands; that the defendant,  Ramirez, can not and  should not be permitted in this action to deny the plaintiff's right  to the possession of the property in question, because he can not be heard to set up title thereto in himself or a third person, at least until  he has first formally surrendered  it to the plaintiff who intrusted it to his care; that the municipality of Lagonoy has failed to show by evidence of record that it is or ever was in physical possession of the property in question;  and that the possession of the  defendant,  Ramirez, can not be relied upon as the possession of the municipality because the same reason which estops Ramirez from denying the right of possession in the plaintiff estops any other person claiming possession through him from denying that right.  I  agree,  furthermore,  with the finding  that  the defendant municipality failed to establish a  better right to the possession than  the plaintiff in this action, because, claiming to be the owner  by virtue of a grant from  the Philippine Government, it failed to establish the existence of such grant; and because, furthermore, it was shown that the plaintiff or his predecessors had been in possession and control of the property in question for a long  period of years prior to the treaty  of Paris by lawful authority of the King of Spain, and that since the sovereignty of these Islands has been  transferred  to the United States the new sovereign has never  at any time divested or attempted to divest the plaintiff of this possession and control.</p>
<p>Thus fur I am able to accept the reasoning of the majority opinion, and these propositions, supported as they are by the law and the evidence in this case, completely dispose of the question before us and establish the  right of the plaintiff to a judgment for possession.</p>
<p>I am not prepared, however, to give my assent to the proposition that prior to the treaty of Paris "The King of Spain was not the owner of the property in question nor of any other  property like it situated in the Philippine Islands," and inferentially that the United States is not now the owner thereof and has no property rights therein other than, perhaps, the mere right of eminent domain.</p>
<p>I decline to affirm this  proposition,  first, because  it is not necessary in  the  decision of this  case;  and second, because I am of opinion that, in the unlimited and unrestricted  sense in which  it is stated in the  majority opinion, it is inaccurate and misleading, if  not wholly erroneous.</p>
<p>That it is not necessary for the proper disposition of this case will Ik; apparent if we consider the purpose for which it is introduced in  the argument and the proposition which it is intended to controvert.  As stated in the  majority opinion, the claim of ownership of the  defendant municipality‚Äî</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Is rested  upon the following  propositions: That the property in question belonged, prior to the treaty of Paris, to tin1 Spanish Government; that by the treaty of Paris the ownership thereof passed to the Government of the United States; that by article 12 of the act of Congress of July 1, 1902,  such property was transferred to the Government of the Philippine Islands,  and that by a circular of  that Government dated November 11, 1902, the ownership and the right  to the possession of this property passed to the municipality  of Lagonoy."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is evident that if any one of these propositions is successfully controverted, the defendants' claim of ownership must fall to the ground.  The majority opinion finds (and I am in on tire accord as to this finding) that neither the Government of the United States nor the Philippine Government has  ever made,  or attempted to make, such transfer, and  in  making  this finding  it completely,  conclusively, and finally disposes  of defendants' claim of ownership.</p>
<p>All the acts of the Government of the United  States and of the present Government of the Philippine Islands which can have any  relation to the property in question are before us, and so short a period of years lias elapsed since the transfer of the sovereignty of these Islands to  the United States that it is .possible to demonstrate with  the utmost certainty that bv no act  of the United States or  of  the Government of the Philippine Islands has the ownership and possession of this property been conferred upon  the defendant municipality; it is a very different undertaking, however, to review the legislation of Spain for the three centuries of her Philippine  occupation for the  purpose of deciding the much-vexed question  of the respective property rights  of the  Spanish  sovereign  and the  Koman Catholic Church  in  State constructed  and  State aided churches in these Islands; and if I am correct  in my contention that a holding that  the "King of Spain was not," and, inferentially,  that  the Government  of the  United States is not, "the owner of this  property or any other property like it situated in the Philippine Islands'1 is not necessary for the full, final, and complete determination of the case at bar, then I think that this court should refrain from making so momentous a finding in a case wherein the United  States is  not a. party and has  never had an  opportunity to be heard.</p>
<p>But the mere fact that a finding  that the King of Spain had no right of ownership  in this property which could pass to the United States under the provisions of the treaty of Paris is not necessary in my opinion for the disposition of the case at  bar, would not impose upon me the duty of writing a separate opinion  if it were in fact and at  law a correct holding.  I am  convinced, however,  that when stated  without limitations or restrictions, as  it appears in the majority opinion,  it is inaccurate and misleading, and it may not be improper, therefore, to indicate briefly my reasons for doubting  it.</p>
<p>As stated in the majority opinion, "it does not admit of doubt that the parish churches  in  the  Philippines were built by the  Spanish Government," and it would seem therefore that prior to  their dedication,  the  beneficial ownership, the legal title, the possession arid control of all this  property must be taken to have been  vested in that  Government.  But  it  must be admitted that after this property  was dedicated, the ownership, in contemplation of Spanish law, was said to have been in  God, and there can be  no doubt that the  physical possession and control of these churches  for the purposes for which they were dedicated was given  to the Roman Catholic  Church‚Äî not, as I think, absolutely  and conclusively, but limited by and subject to the royal patronage  (<em>patronato real</em>) which included the right  to intervene in the appointment of the representatives of the church into whose hands  the possession  and control of the sacred edifices were to be intrusted.</p>
<p>The anomalous  status  thus created might well have given rise to doubts and uncertainties as to the legal title and  beneficial ownership of this property  had not  the grantor and the lawgiver  of Spain expressly and specifically provided that  neither  the  Roman  Catholic  Church nor  any other person was or could  become the  owner thereof,  and  that all these sacred edifices were to  be regarded as beyond the commerce of men.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"No sacred, religious, or holy thing, devoted to the service of God, can be the subject of ownership  by  any man, nor can it be considered as included in his property holdings.   Although the priests may have such things in their possession,  yet they are  not  the  owners  thereof.   They hold them thus as guardians or servants, or  because they have the care of the same  and serve God in or with them. Hence they were allowed to take from the revenues of the church and lands what was reasonably necessary for their support; the balance, belonging to God, was to be devoted to pious purposes, such as the feeding and clothing of the poor, the support of orphans, the marrying of poor virgins to prevent  their becoming evil  women because of their poverty; and for the redemption of  captives and the repairing of the churches, and the  buying of chalices, clothing, books, and other things which they might be in need of, and  other similar  charitable  purposes."   (Law 12,  title 28, <em>partida</em> 3.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is difficult to determine, and still more difficult to state, the precise meaning and legal effect of this disposition of the ownership, possession, and control of  the parish churches in the Philippines; but  since it was not possible for God, in any usual or ordinary sense  to  take or hold, to enforce or to defend the legal title to  this property, it would seem that a  grant to Him by the King or the Government of  Spain could not suffice to convey to Him the legal  title of the property set out in the grant, and  the truth would seem to be that the treatment of this property in contemplation of Spanish law as the property of  God was a mere arbitrary convention, the purpose and object of which was to crystallize the status of all such property in the peculiar and unusual mold in which it was cast at the time of its dedication.</p>
<p>So  long as church and  state  remained united and so long as the Roman Catholic Church  continued  to be  the church  of the State, this  convention served its purpose well;  indeed, its very indefiniteness seems  to have aided in the accomplishment of the end for which it was adopted, and on  a review of all the pertinent citations of Spanish law which have been brought to my  attention,  I am satisfied  that the status created by the  above-cited law 12 of the <em>partidas</em> continued Avithout substantial  modification to  the date of the transfer  of sovereignty  from the King of Spain to the United States.   But this transfer of sovereignty,  and  the absolute severance  of church  and state  which  resulted therefrom, render  it  necessary to ascertain as  definitely as may be the true meaning  and intent  of  this  conventional  treatment  of the  parish churches in  the Philippines as the property of  God,  and it is evident  that for this purpose we must look to the substance rather than the form and examine the intention of the grantor and the object  he sought to attain, rather than the words and conventional terms whereby that intent was symbolically expressed.</p>
<p>It is  not necessary to go beyond the citations of the majority opinion to see that the objects which the grantor sought to attain were, first, and chiefly,  to advance the cause of religion among  the people of the Philippine Islands and to provide for their religious instruction  and edification by furnishing  them with parish churches suitable for the worship and glorification of God;  second, to place  those sacred edifices under the guardian care  and custody  of the church of  the State; and, third,  to deny to that church and to  all others the right of ownership in the  property thus dedicated; and since God could neither take nor hold the legal title to this property, the declaration of the King of Spain  as set out in the above-cited law, that when  dedicated these churches  became  in  some peculiar and  especial  manner  the  property of" God, was in effect no more than a  solemn obligation imposed upon himself  to hold  them for the  purposes for  which  they were dedicated, and to exercise no right  of property in them inconsistent therewith.</p>
<p>This declaration that these  churches are the property of God and the provisions which accompanied  it, appear to me to be precisely equivalent to a declaration of trust by the grantor that he would hold the property  as trustee for the use  for which it  was dedicated‚Äîthat is, for the religious  edification  and  enjoyment of the people of the Philippine Islands‚Äîand that he would give to the Eoman Catholic  Church the physical possession and control thereof, including the disposition of any funds arising therefrom,  under certain  stipulated conditions and for  the purposes expressly provided by law.  In other words, the people of the  Philippine  Islands  became the  beneficial owners of all such property, and the grantor continued to hold the  legal  title, in trust nevertheless to hold the property  for  the purposes for  which it  was dedicated and on the further trust to give the custody and control thereof to the Roman Catholic Church.  If this interpretation of the meaning and intent of the convention of Spanish law which treated God as the oAvner of the parish  churches of the Philippine Islands  be  correct, a holding that  the King of Spain had no right of ownership in this property which could pass to the United States by virtue of  the treaty of Paris can not be maintained; and it is to withhold my assent from this proposition that I have been compelled to write this separate opinion.</p>
For the purposes of this  opinion it is not necessary, nor would it be profitable, to do more than indicate the line of reasoning which has led me to my conclusions, nor to discuss at  length the question  of ownership of this property,  because whether it be held to be in abeyance or  in God or in  the Roman Catholic Church  or in  the United States it has been  shown  without  deciding this question of ownership that the right to  the possession for the purpose for which it was dedicated is in the Roman Catholic Church, and while the complaint in this action alleges that the Roman Catholic Church is the owner of the property in question, the  prayer of the complaint is for the possession of this property of which it is alleged that church has been unlawfully deprived;  and because,  furthermore, if I am correct in my contention  that the legal  title to the State constructed churches in  the  Philippines passed to the United  States by virtue  of the treaty of Paris, it passed, nevertheless, subject to  the trusts under which it was held prior  thereto, and the United  States can not at will repudiate the conditions  of that trust and retain its place in the circle of civilized nations; and as long as this property continues to be used for the purposes for which it was dedicated,  the Government of  the  United States has  no lawful right to  deprive the Roman  Catholic  Church of the possession and  control thereof under the  terms and conditions  upon which that possession and control were originally granted.<br>
