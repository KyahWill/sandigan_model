				G.R. No. 886, September 09, 1902</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE, VS. ADRIANO SOLAR, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>SMITH, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> In this case Adriano Solar  was convicted in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Pangasinan of the crime of "attempt to rape" and  sentenced to four years and two months imprisonment in the public prison of the province, with costs.  He now appeals to this court from the judgment, and the only question raised by his appeal is the sufficiency of the evidence upon which his conviction was secured.  The testimony  for the prosecution as disclosed by the record is to the  effect that about 10 o'clock of the morning of the 15th of November, 1901, the accused, Adriano Solar, having a knife in his hands, entered the house in which  the  prosecuting  witness,  Juliana Perez, then  was and seizing her hands attempted to embrace her and to throw her on the  floor.  All this took place near  an open window  of  the house and  in  the  actual presence of Aniceta Solar, the aunt of Adriano  Solar, and Potenciana Salcedo, the aunt of Juliana Perez.  The accused said nothing from the time he entered the house and commenced the assault until  he left it after the complainant, with the aid of the  other  two women, had released herself from him.  The  prosecutrix claims that she received injuries about the head and  breast caused by the knife in the hands of Solar.  From these injuries she  says she recovered in about a week.</p>
<p>The only witness in behalf of the defense is the accused himself, who testified that he lived in the same house with his accuser and that  she is  the daughter of Antonio Perez and  one Petra Salinas, who  was the  concubine  of his father.  He further says that he went to the house on thÂ£ morning of the alleged offense and in the presence of Tomas Tirao, Maxima, his wife, and Aniceta Solar, ordered Juliana Perez to  leave the house because  she and her mother had stolen certain documents  and  money from him and had tried to bribe a man by the name of Pedro to kill him.  He says, also, he  inflicted no violence on the prosecutrix, and that she denounced him to the court in revenge for being ordered from the house.  Neither Pedro, Tomas Tirao, nor his wife were produced as  witnesses.</p>
<p> One of the essential elements of the crime of "attempt to rape" is the intent to have carnal knowledge of a woman against her will, and in despite of any resistance she may make.  If this element is wanting or the prosecution fails to establish it by competent evidence beyond a reasonable doubt the charge is not made out and no conviction on it can be had.</p>
<p> The evidence in this case seems to show that an assault was committed, but hardly goes to the extent of establishing that it was committed with the intent to rape.  There is no, act, word, or deed which satisfactorily shows beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused sought to have criminal knowledge of the  person of the complaining witness or that his design was any other than the infliction  on her of physical violence or bodily harm.</p>
<p> Any inference or presumption that he intended to violate the  complainant which might be drawn  from  the fact that  he seized her hands, put his arms about her, and attempted to  throw her on  the floor  is overcome by  the fact that  these acts of violence were perpetrated in broad daylight  near an  open window  in the  presence  of close relatives of both.   Crimes against the chastity of women are not usually committed in the presence of persons not aiding and abetting the offense and much less in the immediate personal presence of kinswomen whose active opposition might be reasonably expected.</p>
<p> The evidence being insufficient to support the charge of "an attempt to rape" the judgment based on it  ought to   be reversed, and it is so ordered, with costs <em>de oficio.</em></p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J.,  Torres, Cooper, Willard,  Mapa,</em> and <em>Ladd, JJ., </em>concur.</p>
