				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>From a review of the evidence in this case on appeal it appears that the petitioner excepted to the judgment of the Court  of Land  Registration denying his petition  to have a certain tract of land registered.</p>
<p>It further appears that the petition for registration was presented by Jose Figueras in behalf of Manuel Testagorda Figueras, exhibiting as evidence of ownership a title of composition or patent issued by the Spanish Government on the 21st of October, 1898; that the court considered it necessary to require additional proof and for this purpose examined three witnesses, to wit, the petitioner, the secretary of the provincial board of Iloilo,  who  signed  the said patent issued by the governor of that province, and the member of the said board in charge of the  composition of public lands according to the royal decree of the 13th of February, 1894; that the  petitioner  testified that his principal,  Manuel Testagorda" Figueras,  had not been  in possession of the land prior to the date upon which the patent was issued, and that Roman Solis, who applied to the Spanish Government for the aforesaid patent,  was the one who had been in possession of the land; that in view of this statement the court below received the testimony of Roman Solis, who testified that he had applied for a patent to this land prior to the  year  189(i,  Testagorda Figueras  having  made  a similar petition about a year .later,  and  that he,  Solis, transferred to him his  right to have the said patent issued, his own petition being thereby suspended; that neither Testagorda Figueras nor Solis had been in  possession of the land,  but that the people had possession of the  land whose houses were thereon and who were thereafter ejected therefrom; that  Testagorda Figueras entered upon  the possession of the land  after he  had obtained  the patent in question;  and that in view of  the fact that the land for which a patent had been granted had  not been occupied or possessed  by the petitioner, possession being a necessary requisite for  the issuance of such  patent, the court below found that the patent had been granted upon a false basis and held that it was, therefore,  null and void.  This is the reason why the Court of  Land  Registration refused to consider such patent sufficient to show that the petitioner had title to the land, the registration of which was sought.</p>
<p>It has, therefore, been laid down as a conclusion of fact that the land the ownership of  which is  sought to be registered has never been possessed by the petitioner.</p>
<p>We find no evidence or any provision of law upon which to set aside this conclusion. We can not conclude that the petitioner was in possession, and that this possession was established in the  corresponding proceedings as existing prior to  the  issuance of  the patent merely because the patent would not have been issued had not such  possession been proved.  This would be purely a presumption which can not be entertained  in view of the testimony of the petitioner himself which we consider conclusive  and which makes unnecessary any  other  proof.  His  admission is decisive in this case.   He testified that  there had not been possession of the land prior to the date upon  which the patent was issued, and as there can be no composition without possession, it is to be inferred there was  nothing upon which to base such composition, and  consequently that the patent issued was absolutely void.</p>
<p>The petitioner alleged that Roman  Solis had been in possession of the land for some time, but this  Solis emphatically denied at the trial.  In our opinion the court below had ample power to investigate and ascertain the truth of this allegation made by the petitioner in support of his petition.  The power of the Court of Land Registration is more ample than that of any other court of record.   It may require the introduction of additional evidence  under the authority granted by the act creating it.  It is  not bound or limited by the evidence which the parties may see fit to introduce.  It may, even  against the  stipulation of  the petitioner and the contestant, proceed to secure  the necessary evidence to  convince itself of the right  of  ownership which is sought to  be  registered.</p>
<p>If this patent had been submitted to the courts of justice existing in  these Islands under the Spanish sovereignty, the Government could have maintained an action for the recovery of the land on the ground that the patent had been unduly issued or that it was not authentic,  and the petitioner could not have insisted upon its  admission.  The fiscal knowing of  its existence  could  have  opposed its admission as evidence of title or questioned its authenticity. And the same thing  can be done today under the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure now  in force.   It is true that no evidence against the terms of a written contract is admissible except the document itself (sec. 285, par. 1), but it is  none the less  true that "this section does  not exclude other evidence of the circumstances under which the agreement was made or to which  it  relates, or to explain an intrinsic ambiguity, or to establish its illegality or  fraud.  The  term 'agreement' includes  deeds and instruments conveying real estate and wills as well as contracts between parties."   (Sec. 285, par. 2.)</p>
<p>The provincial  board  of Iloilo could have  issued  the patent in question on the 21st of October, 1898, provided the petition therefor had been filed prior to the 17th of April, 1894, and renewed before the 17th of  October, 1894, when the  period of six months provided in article 5 of the royal decree of February 13,1894, expired, the  six months to be counted from the promulgation and publication of the said decree in the Official Gazette of Manila, which was on the 17th of April  of the  said year.   Article 7  of the said royal decree provided that there should be published, and there was published, in the Official Gazette of Manila, sufficient summaries  as to  the patent for which application had, been  made in each province  or district, and we have been unable  to  find therein  either the name  of Manuel Testagorda Figueras or that of Roman Soils.   This provision fixing a period within which a former system of procedure would become inoperative was necessary.  Article 4 of the above referred to royal decree provided: "There shall revert to the  State the title to all public arable lands which might have been capable of composition under  the royal decree of June 25,1880, but the composition of which has not been applied for at the time of the promulgation of this decree in  the Official Gazette of Manila.   No claim in regard  to such lands which may be made by those who could but did not  apply for their composition until  the aforesaid  date shall be entertained."  Article  5 provided as follows: "Those whose applications for composition  are still pending must renew the same within the nonextendibie period of six months from the publication of this decree in the Official Gazette of Manila.   Any application not renewed within the  aforesaid  period by  the person who presented it or his assignees shall be considered of no effect, and the provisions of the foregoing article shall be applied to the land to which such applications referred."</p>
<p>If the petitioner in this case is nothing but the assignee of Roman Solis who presented the  application to  the provincial board of Iloilo, as stated by the witness, Jose Figueras, and as insisted upon by the appellant in this court, we have to  consider the said petition as though it had been made by Solis and admit what the latter said, to wit, that he presented the petition "about the year 1896." It has  thus  been shown that there was no possible composition,  and so explained why the name of Roman Solis did not appear in the summaries of petitions published in the  Official  Gazette of Manila whereby the Government can,  even now,  ascertain for itself what petitions were presented in due time—that is to say, prior to the 17th of April, 1894.</p>
<p>After this date  those in  possession of land still  had another means  of  obtaining title to arable land, to  wit, the possessory information proceedings referred to in article 19 of the said royal decree.  But the petitioner in this case  could not avail himself  either of this or the former means prescribed by law, because as  a matter of fact he was never in the physical possession  of the land except after the 21st of October, 1898—that is to say, subsequent to the issuance of the patent in question, which, rather than a title of composition, should be  termed a gratuitous transfer.</p>
<p>For the reasons hereinbefore set out we are of the opinion that none of the errors assigned on  this appeal were committed by the court below, which errors are mainly based upon the supposition that that court  could  not have required on its motion, as it appears  it  did, parol evidence to be introduced in connection with the admission of the patent offered in evidence, the reversion to the State of all the land  therein described,  and the  cancellation of the inscription of the same made in the Registry of Property. The court had the  power to make such investigation and its conclusions were such as would necessarily follow from the absence of evidence tending to show that the land in question which was presumed to be public land had legally passed into the hands of private individuals.</p>
<p>We accordingly affirm the judgment of the court below in all respects, with the costs  of this instance against the appellant.  After the expiration of twenty days  from the date hereof let judgment be entered in accordance herewith and ten days thereafter the record be remanded to the court below for execution.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Mapa, Johnson,</em> and  <em>Carson, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
