				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Complaint in this action was filed on the 11th of August, 1905, in the Court of  First Instance of  Manila, praying that mandamus issue  against the defendants to compel them to restore the plaintiff to his former membership in the association known as the "Manila Jockey Club," from which  it is alleged he was unlawfully expelled by the defendants.  The complaint further prays that the plaintiff be given damages in the sum of  5,000 pesos and that the proceedings be expedited by shortening the period allowed the defendants to appear, and defend the action.  The court thereupon ordered the defendants to appear and file their demurrer or answer within six days after service of summons, but on motion of the defendants, they were allowed a further period of six days in which to file said demurrer or answer.</p>
<p>The  demurrer was filed August 23,  1905, and set  for hearing the following day, and on the 24th of August, 1905, the parties having appeared and submitted their arguments thereon, it was taken under advisement by the court.   On the same day the plaintiff filed an amended complaint, and thereupon the court overruled the demurrer and ordered the defendants to answer the amended complaint on or before 8 o'clock a. m. of the 26th of August, 1905; at that hour defendant's  counsel appeared and filed  a  demurrer to  the amended complaint, which was overruled  and the case set for hearing  on the merits at 10 o'clock a. m. August  28. At the same time the court cautioned the defendants that if  their answer was not filed  at  that  time judgment in default would be entered against them.  Exception  was duly entered to this ruling and shortly before the hour fixed for the hearing, counsel  for the defendants appeared in open court,  and after setting out that he did not believe lie could obtain justice at the hands of the  presiding judge, prayed for a change of venue;  this motion was overruled, and to  this ruling he also excepted and immediately thereafter left the court room, not to return during the trial of the cause.</p>
<p>At 10 a.  m. of the same  day,  the hour fixe4 for the hearing, the defendants not having filed their answer, the court gave judgment in default and after hearing testimony offered  in  support  of the allegations of the complaint, issued a writ of mandamus in accordance with the prayer thereof, and gave judgment in favor of the plaintiff  and against  the defendant company, the Manila Jockey Club, in the sum of 500 pesos.   The defendants excepted to the judgment  of the court and filed their bill of exceptions, which was approved in due form.</p>
<p>Appellants' assignments of error  in this case  are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The court erred in ordering defendants to answer plaintiff's complaint, giving them only <em>one full</em> intervening day within which to do so, <em>in the absence of and without notice to defendants.</em></p>
<p>(2) The court erred in setting the case for trial, on its merits, for August 28,1905, at 10 a. m., <em>there being no issue of fact joined, in the absence of and without notice to defendants.</em></p>
<p>(3) The court erred in ordering defendants to answer plaintiff's amended  complaint (not demur),  giving them only owe full intervening day  within which to do so, <em>without any motion or showing on the part of the plaintiff.</em></p>
<p>(4) The court erred in setting the case for trial, on its merits, for August 28,1905, at 10 a. m., <em>without any motion or showing on the part of plaintiff.</em></p>
<p>(5) The court erred in depriving the defendants of  the legal right to question the legal sufficiency  of plaintiff's amended complaint.</p>
<p>(6) Plaintiff's amended complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.</p>
<p>Under the provisions of section 230 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the trial  court in  an action for mandamus is authorized, "in its discretion,  to make such orders as it deems necessary for  expediting proceedings."</p>
<p>Section 141 of that code provides that—</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Rulings  of the court  upon minor matters, such  as adjournments, postponements of trials, the  extension of time for filing pleadings  or motions,  and other matters addressed to the discretion of the court in the performance of its duty shall not be subject to exception."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Section 503 of the same code provides that—</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"No judgment shall be reversed on formal or technical grounds,, or for such error as has not prejudiced the real rights of the excepting party."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the light of these provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, none of the first four specifications of error can be sustained, unless it affirmatively  appears that there was an abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court and that the real rights of the appellants were prejudiced thereby.</p>
<p>The complaint expressly prays  that the time be shortened within which the defendants might appear and demur or answer thereto.  An examination of the bill of exceptions discloses that counsel for the defendants was furnished with notice of all orders expediting the proceedings immediately upon the filing of such orders by the court, and as counsel appeared at every stage of the proceedings prior to the hearing, there can be  no  doubt that he had actual notice of all such  orders and an opportunity to be heard and to move for an extension of the time allowed thereby and to except to the issuance thereof.</p>
<p>Counsel for appellants did not move for an extension of the time allowed  within which  to answer  the amended complaint, after his demurrer had been overruled, nor did he ask for a continuance when the cause was set for hearing.  Instead of doing so, he presented himself in the court and moved for a change of venue, and upon this motion being overruled, voluntarily  withdrew  from the presence of the court and took no further part in the proceedings. It appears from  the record that, on motion of counsel for the appellants, an extension of six. days was granted in the time allowed in which to demur  or answer, and the court having shown its willingness  to give the defendants full opportunity to prepare their defense, we can not hold that it would have unjustly denied a  motion for the extension of the time allowed to file an answer to the amended  complaint and to proceed to the trial upon the merits had counsel  for appellants requested such an extension and made a reasonable showing in support of his motion.</p>
<p>Under all the circumstances we do not think that the trial court can be said to have abused its discretion  in making these orders expediting the proceedings, nor that the defendants were in anywise prejudiced thereby.</p>
<p>These remarks dispose of the first four specifications of error, except in so far as it is alleged that the court erred! in setting the time for the hearing of  the case without joinder in the pleadings on an issue of  fact;  but counsel for appellants can not be  heard to urge this  objection  to the proceedings in the court below, because his demurrer having been overruled, he was directed to answer prior to the time set for the hearing; and had he obeyed this order, his answer  (under the provisions of the code)  would have brought the pleadings  to an issue or else, in the event that his answer were of such a nature as to call  for further pleading on the part of the plaintiff, it  would be for the plaintiff to  complain that the court was proceeding to trial on the merits without  affording him a proper  opportunity to reply to the answer  filed by the defendants.</p>
<p>The fifth assignment of  error is based upon the alleged arbitrary deprivation of defendants' right to test the legal sufficiency of the amended complaint.  An examination  of the record as set out in the bill of exceptions shows clearly that the defendants were not in fact deprived of this right. Counsel  for defendants presented their  demurrer to the amended complaint; the demurrer was duly filed but was overruled by the court, and to this ruling the defendants excepted, thus saving  to themselves the right  to have the action of the trial court reviewed on appeal and the  error corrected.</p>
<p>Counsel insists that  the  reasons assigned for overruling the demurrer were erroneous; but granted that they  were, error in overruling a demurrer is not equivalent to deprivation of the right to demur, so long as the right to  have such in error reviewed and corrected was duly  preserved to the defendant, as it was in this case.</p>
<p>Had the appellants  assigned as error the action of the court below in  overruling their demurrer, it  would now become our duty to examine the demurrer and if the rulings thereon were erroneous to  correct such error;  but counsel made no such assignment of error in  the  printed brief in this  court and  expressly waived his  right to have the action of the court in overruling the  demurrer reviewed, except in so far as  it involved his contention that the plaintiff's amended complaint does not state  facts sufficient to constitute a cause  of action, which contention is made the basis of the sixth assignment of error.</p>
<p>Appellants contend that  the complaint is insufficient, first, because, as they allege, it does not  appear that there is any legal duty on the defendants to do that for which mandamus is prayed to compel  them to do; and second, because it does not appear that the plaintiff made formal demand upon the  defendants to  do that which this court is prayed to compel them to do.</p>
<p>It can not be denied that,  admitting the truth of  the facts set out in the complaint, there was  a legal duty upon the defendant company, the Manila Jockey Club,, to restore the plaintiff to his rights of membership, nor does counsel for the defendants insist upon the contrary view; he does insist, however, that it is  not shown that the members of the board of directors, who were joined with the defendant company, were under any  such obligation.</p>
<p>The  complaint expressly alleges that the board of directors, the governing body of  the defendant company, administers and directs the affairs of the company; that by  resolution, later approved at a  general meeting, it expelled the plaintiff from membership, and that it continues to deprive him of his rights as a member of the club. We think it was proper and  highly convenient to  make the members of  such a board joint defendants with  the company, not merely because it appears that acting for and with the  company they had  deprived  and continue to deprive the plaintiff of his legal rights as a member,  but also because in the effective execution  of the terms of  the writ of mandamus of the court, directing the company to restore the plaintiff to membership and  the enjoyment of the privileges thereof, affirmative action of some sort on  the part of the members of the board would  appear to be necessary, the administration and direction of the affairs of the company being confided to their hands.  (La Bette County <em>vs</em>. United States, 112 U. S., 217.)</p>
<p>There seems to be some conflict in  the American authorities as to the necessity for joinder with a joint stock company of the members of its board of directors in mandamus proceedings, but the weight of authority supports the view heretofore  stated, and  even in those jurisdictions where it is not held to be absolutely necessary, the joinder of the individual  members is  usually treated as mere  surplusage and error without prejudice.r (Encyc. Pl. &amp; Pr., vol.  13, 652 and 653;.notes and cases cited there.)</p>
<p>The last question to  be considered  is whether, under the circumstances set  out  in  the complaint, action for mandamus  would lie where  it does not appear that formal demand had previously been made by the plaintiff on the defendants whom it is sought to coerce by the writ. No objection  appears to have been urged in the court below on account of a  want of a previous formal  demand, and it is therefore  too late to urge the objection now, even if we were to  concede  its  materiality.</p>
<p>"The objection," says Tappon, in his work on mandamus, "as to the neglect of a demand, or the absence of a refusal, should, in order to prevent a waste of time, be objected to in the first  instance, viz, on showing cause against the rule for the writ, and can not  be made after the merits of the case have been discussed," and the same rule is laid down in High on Extraordinary Remedies, section 515.  (City of Chicago <em>vs</em>. Sansum, 87 111., 182;  Chicago, etc., K. Co., <em>vs</em>. Chase County, 49 Kans., 399; Owen <em>vs</em>. Gamble, 3 Per. &amp; Dav., 123, note <em>d</em>.)</p>
<p>The judgment of the trial court is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellants, and after the expiration  of ten days judgment will be entered and the case remanded to the court below for action in accordance herewith.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Mapa, Johnson,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em>Willard,  J.,</em> concurs  in  the result.</p>
<p><em>Torres, J.,</em> did not sit in this case.<br>
