				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On or about the 19th day of February, 1906, the plaintiff turned  over to the defendant certain goods,  wares, and merchandise to be transported from the city of Manila to the pueblo of Tabaco.   These goods were  put on board the steamship <em>Venus</em>,  which ship belonged to and  was under the control of the defendant.</p>
<p>The said  ship left Manila  with the goods,  wares, and merchandise on board on or about the said 19th day of February and arrived at the pueblo of Tabaco some days later. Upon the arrival of the ship at the pueblo of Tabaco, and in fact some days before, the captain in charge of the vessel discovered that a  portion  of the said goods,  wares, and merchandise were  submerged in water in the hold of  the ship and were practically destroyed.  The plaintiff claims that the damages done  to his goods amounted to  the sum of P738.45, and no question  is  raised as to the amount of damage done.</p>
<p>On the 26th day of April, 1906, the plaintiff commenced an action in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila against  the defendant,  for the purpose of  recovering the sum of P738.45,  the amount  of damage  alleged to have been done to said  goods, wares, and merchandise.  To the complaint of the plaintiff the defendant filed a  general and special answer, alleging for his special defense that  the damages occasioned to  said merchandise  were  not  caused by his negligence, but by circumstances over which he had no control.  The issue thus formed was finally brought on for trial on the 11th day of October, 190(J.  The judge of the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, after hearing the evidence adduced during the trial of  the cause, made the following finding of facts:</p>
<ol>
  <li> That the plaintiff is a regular company registered and doing business in the city of Manila.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> That the defendant is a  corporation authorized and registered in the city of Manila.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> That the defendant is the owner and does business in vessels for the  transportation  of passengers and merchandise between the city of Manila and other points  in the Philippine Islands.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> That on or about the 20th or 22d of February, 1906, the plaintiff delivered certain merchandise to the defendant, under an agreement  to transport the same from the city of Manila to the pueblo  of Tabaco in the steamship Venus of the property of the defendant.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> That among the merchandise so delivered there was a box of shoes;  that when the said box of shoes had arrived at the pueblo of Tabaco  it was found to have been immersed in water during the voyage, while it was  deposited in the <em>bodega</em> (hold)  of the ship, and that the contents of said box  were  entirely destroyed; "that  the value of the shoes contained in said box was P738.45.</li>
</ol>
<p>Upon these facts the judge of the lower court concluded that there was nothing in the proof adduced during the trial of the cause which was sufficient to relieve the defendant of the responsibility occasioned by the damage done to said merchandise,  and therefore  rendered a judgment against the defendant and in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of P738.45, with interest at the rate of 6 per cent from the 26th  day of April, 1906, and costs.  From this judgment the defendant appealed  to this court and made the following assignment of errors:</p>
<ol>
  <li> In  making the defendant-appellant responsible for damages  caused by <em>force majeure.</em><br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> In declaring that the third person, to whom the damaged merchandise appears to have been sold by the  plaintiff, refused to pay the said plaintiff for the value thereof.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> In not declaring the plaintiff's lack of right to bring this action.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the lower court practically the only defense that was offered by the defendant was to the effect that a pipe or tube running from one of the  tanks in the stern of the vessel, for the purpose of allowing air to escape, had become rusted and punctured full of holes, so that when the tank was filled with water on that side of the vessel, owing to the list of the ship, the water ran up into this tube or pipe and escaped through the holes into the <em>bodega</em> of the vessel  and thus some of  the merchandise in transportation became wet and was damaged.   This was the defense relied upon by the defendant and the one relied upon in the above first assignment of error.</p>
<p>The defendant and  appellant claims that  the  injuries occasioned to the merchandise in question were caused by <em>fuerza mayor</em>.   If it is  true that the injuries were  the result  of <em>fuerza mayor</em>, then the defendant is entirely relieved  from responsibility and liability.  (Art.  620, Commercial Code.)</p>
<p>Upon the question of the cause of the injury the chief engineer, in charge during the voyage when the said damage was done, testified as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Q.  After the damage  did you see the pipe?—A.  After the damage took place the inspector was informed when we arrived in Manila.</p>
  <p>"Q.  Did you  see the pipe at that time?—A. Yes, sir; after the wooden covering was opened.</p>
  <p>"Q.  In what condition was the pipe?—A. It was broken.</p>
  <p>"Q.  How  was it broken?—A. There were porous holes in the pipe and the water came out.<br>
    "Q.  Will you  explain what you mean by porous?—A. The pipe was made of cast iron  and I believe the pipe, on account of being old, had rusted through.</p>
  <p>"Q.  Do you mean on account of the age of the pipe it had rusted and eaten through?—A. Yes, sir.</p>
  <p>"Q.  So  the damage caused was on account of the pipe having been old?—A. I am unable to tell you.</p>
  <p>"Q.   So owing to the rust you have seen, you believe that the holes that you found in that pipe were on account of the pipe being old?—A.  I suppose so.</p>
  <p>"Q. What was the thickness of that pipe?—A. One-half inch.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
  <p>"Q. Was that pipe unfit for use?—A. Yes, sir." Carlos Pombo,  ship  inspector, testified relating to the cause of the injury as follows:</p>
  <p>"Q. To  what do you attribute the breaking  of  that pipe?—A. It could be attributed to many causes; it was probably more or  less to the amount of water in the bilge keel; it might be through some accident; it might have been  caused  by  the filling up of the tank; very likely the loading of some heavy stuff on board and it falling on the board covering of  the pipe might have caused the breaking<br>
    of it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are satisfied  from an examination of  the  record brought to this court that the damages occasioned were not of such a character as to be characterized as <em>force majeure.</em> Where the officers of a vessel fail to make such frequent inspection of their ship as  to discover the existence of rusted parts, from which injuries to cargo result, we  are of the opinion that such injuries can not be attributed to force majeure, but rather to  the negligence of the officials of such ship.</p>
<p>An examination of the Spanish and American  authorities concerning the meaning of force majeure shows that the jurisprudence  of these two countries practically agree upon  the meaning  of this phrase.</p>
<p>Blackstone, in his Commentaries on English Law, defines it as—</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Inevitable accident or casualty; an accident produced by any physical cause which is irresistible; such as lightning,  tempest, perils of the sea, inundation,  or  earthquake; the sudden  illness or death of a person."  (2  Blackstone's Commentaries, 122; Story on Bailments, sec. 25.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Escriche, in his  <em>Diccionario de Legislation y Jurisprudencia</em>, defines <em>fuerza mayor</em> as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The event which we could neither foresee nor resist;  as, for example, the lightning  stroke,  hail, inundation,  hurricane,  public enemy, attack  by robbers;  <em>Vis  major est, says Cayo, ea quw consilio humano neque provideri neque vitari potest</em>.  Accident and mitigating circumstances." Bouvier defines the same as—</p>
  <p>"Any accident due to  natural causes, directly, exclusively without human intervention, such as could not have been prevented by any kind of oversight, pains, and  care reasonably to have been expected."  (Law Reports, 1 Common Pleas  Division, 423;  Law  Reports,  10 Exchequer, 255.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cockburn, chief  justice,  in  a well-considered English case (1 Common Pleas Division, 34, 432), said that where a captain—</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Uses all the known means to which prudent and experienced captains  ordinarily have recourse, he does all that can be reasonably required of him;  and if, under such circumstances, he is overpowered by storm or other natural agency, he is within the rule which gives immunity from the effects of such <em>vis major</em>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The term generally applies, broadly speaking, to natural accidents, such as those  caused by  lightning, earthquake, tempests,  public enemy, etc.</p>
<p>Article. 618 of the Commercial Code provides, among other things, that—</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The captain shall be civilly liable to the agent and the latter to the third persons who may have made contracts with the former, for all the damages suffered by the vessel and its cargo by reason of want of skill or negligence on his  part."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the present case the captain admits that the injury was occasioned by reason of a rusted pipe.  The rust, of course, was occasfoned by natural causes, but the failure to discover the unsafe condition of the pipe was due to the negligence of the persons in charge of the vessel and for this negligence the owner of the boat is liable to the persons injured.</p>
<p>Upon the second assignment of error above noted, the plaintiff contends  that the  merchandise in question  was by him to be delivered to the purchaser of the same at Tabaco, and that he was under obligation to deliver the same  in  good condition.  If  this be true,  then whatever damages were done to the  said  merchandise prior to delivery were damages done to the plaintiff.  This contention of the plaintiff  is supported by the fact that the purchaser of the merchandise, immediately upon  discovering the damaged  condition  of  the same, presented  a claim against the plaintiff concerning the said damages.  Upon this question the lower court, in its decision,  said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The evidence is rather meager upon  this question, but I  find that the person  to whom the merchandise was sold immediately reclaimed from  the plaintiff the loss thereof, and refused to pay for the merchandise, and that the plaintiff suffered the loss of the merchandise and the damages arising therefrom."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are of  the opinion, therefore, and so hold,  that the plaintiff herein was the proper party to  bring said action. This conclusion, in our opinion, also disposes of the third assignment of error  above noted.</p>
<p>For all of the foregoing reasons, we are of the  opinion, and so hold, that the judgment of the lower court should be affirmed, with costs.</p>
<p>After the expiration of  twenty days let judgment be entered against the defendant and in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of P738.45, with interest at the rate of 6 per cent from the 26th  day of April,  1906, with costs.  So ordered.</p>
