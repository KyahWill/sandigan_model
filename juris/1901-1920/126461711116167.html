				G.R. No. 997, May 19, 1903</h4>
				<H3>MARIA UBALDO, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. LAO-JIANQUIAO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The lessee signed two contracts with the lessor, one  on the 15th of September as to  two houses, and one on  the 17th of October, 1900, as to  another.</p>
<p>The plaintiff, Ubaldo, who  is the lessor, complains that the defendant, Lao-Jianquiao, who is the lessee, has failed to  pay for cleaning the water-closets, and  has  stored  in the building several  cases of  coal oil.</p>
<p>The two grounds for eviction having been  disputed and the acts imputed to the lessee denied, the judgment below discusses the question as to whether these acts constitute a breach of the contract and  concludes that they  do not, and that  it can not have been the intention of a lessee, who has advanced 3,000 pesos on account of rental, to  break the conditions of  a contract, exposing himself to be  dispossessed  of the building in which he  has invested so considerable a sum and which he is to  recover from time to time  as the rent becomes due.</p>
<p>The court has no occasion to enter into an examination of the facts or the evidence.  The storing of cases of coal oil is stated to be a breach of clause 5 of both contracts. The  fifth  clause  of the  first  contract  reads as follows: "Lao-Jianquiao, under the most strict responsibility, contracts to refrain from storing in the premises to be occupied by him  any considerable quantity of combustible articles or goods which tend to imperil the building and the neighborhood; and if the competent authorities should demand the removal of such things, he undertakes to comply with this demand immediately and to suffer the consequences."</p>
<p>In the second contract, however, the  lease uses the following language:  "Under his personal strict responsibility the tenant undertakes not  to store  *  *  *   etc.; that he will  immediately  remove such materials should the authorities so direct, and will submit to whatever the said authorities may direct on this account."   It is easy to see what  is the  sanction of this  condition—that of  being responsible to the proper authorities (that is, the administrative authorities) for any breach of the municipal ordinances as to the storage of inflammable substances, and to be subrogated in the place of the proprietor with respect to all consequences arising therefrom.  When a contract, in the same manner as a  law,  prescribes a penalty for infraction of its terms and conditions, this penalty so established is the effect of the breach of the condition or agreement.  The penalty stipulated in both  contracts is not eviction  by the courts but an administrative eviction, if the competent authorities  so demand, should so direct—not if the lessor so demands.</p>
<p>Now, with respect to the failure to keep the premises clean.  Clause 4 in both contracts is as  follows: "During the period of the occupation of the tenement (second contract) the  cleaning, lighting, etc., thereof shall  be at his expense  and under his responsibility."   Neither in the general vocabulary, nor in any  special,  technical vocabulary of city sanitation does the word "cleaning" have the meaning  which the lessor contends that it implies, nothing of this kind having been expressed, agreed upon, or clearly and precisely established in the contract, it being1 a burdensome obligation which generally falls upon the lessor.</p>
<p>The judgment below  is affirmed, with the costs  to the appellant.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Cooper,  Willard, Ladd,</em> and <em>Mapa, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
