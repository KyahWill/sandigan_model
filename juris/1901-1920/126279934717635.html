				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>It was proven at the trial of this case that on the morning of the 2d of December, 1905, the appellant, Pio Castillo, presented a check for  the sum of 56 pesos, Philippine currency, to a Chinese merchant named  Lim Ponso; that the said check was made payable to bearer and purported to be drawn by one James  J. Watkins; that the  amount of the check was paid to Pio Castillo; that the  signature of the drawer upon said check was a forgery  made in imitation of the genuine  signature of James  J. Watkins, sheriff of the city of Iloilo, and that, in fact, the said James J. Watkins never signed or issued the said check; that the blank upon which the check was  written was stolen from  a book of blank checks between  the hours of 12 noon on  the 1st of December, 1903, and 11 a. m. on the 2d of December, 1903, when the check was presented for payment; that this blank check book was kept in a drawer in the office of the said James J. Watkins, and that Pio Castillo was one of three clerks employed by Watkins in his office; that Castillo was in the office on the evening of  December 1 and  early in the morning of December 2, and that he was the last person left alone in the office on&nbsp; the evening of December 1, he having locked the office after all the other clerks had gone.</p>
<p>Castillo went on the witness stand in his own behalf and swore that he had never seen the forged check prior to the trial; that he was not at the business place of the Chinese merchant; Lim Ponso, on the 2d of December, 1903;  and that he never received the money which it is alleged  was paid him upon the .check; but the falsity of all these statements, in every particular, was conclusively established by the testimony of a number of disinterested witnesses for the prosecution.</p>
<p>Upon this evidence the trial court held that the prosecution had failed to establish the charge of falsification, but found the accused guilty of the crime of knowingly using with  intent to gain  a falsified mercantile document as defined and penalized in article 302 of the Penal Code, and sentenced him to  five months' imprisonment (<span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span>) with the accessory penalties.</p>
<p>We think the evidence in this  case was sufficient to sustain a finding that  the accused was guilty of the crime of falsification as charged.  The question involved is stated as follows in Wharton's Criminal Law (vol. 1, par. 726):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Does  the uttering of a forged instrument by a  particular person justify  a jury in convicting such a  person of forgery?  This question,  if nakedly put, must, like the kindred one as to the proof of larceny by evidence of possession of stolen goods, be answered  in the  negative.  The defendant is  presumed  to  be innocent  until otherwise proved.  In larceny this presumption is overcome by proof that the possession is so recent that it becomes difficult to conceive  how the defendant could have got the' property without being in some way concerned in the stealing.   So it is with the uttering.  The uttering  may be so closely connected in time with the forging,  the utterer may be proved to have such capacity for forging,  or such close connection with the  forgers that it becomes, when so accomplished, probable proof of complicity in the forgery."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See, as in the main  substantiating this view,  U. S. <em>vs</em>. Britton (2 Mason, 464,1826); Spencer <em>vs</em>. Com.  (2 Leigh, 751, 1830); State <em>vs</em>. Morgan (2 Dev.&amp; Bat, 348, 1837); State <em>vs</em>.  Outs (30 La. An., Pt. II, 1155, 1878); Cohn <em>vs</em>. People [(Colo.) 2 West Coast Rep., 528, 1884].</p>
<p>In Massachusetts, wherein it has been held that the mere fact of uttering is not proof of forgery (Com. <em>vs</em>. Parmenter, 5 Pick., 279, 1827), it has been decided,  nevertheless, that possession of a forged, instrument by a person claiming under it is strong evidence tending to prove that he forged it or caused it to be forged."   (Com. <em>vs</em>. Talbot, 84 Mass. (2 Allen), 161.)  In several jurisdictions it has been held that one  found in the  possession of a forged order issued in his own favor is presumed either to have forged it or procured it to be forged.   (Hobbs <em>vs</em>. State, 75 Ala., 1; State, <em>vs</em>. Britt, 14 N, C. (3 Div.), 122.)</p>
<p>For the purposes of this case it is not necessary to hold, and we do not hold, that the mere fact that the accused uttered the check in question is proof  of the fact that he also forged it or caused it to be forged, but we do hold that the  utterance  of such an  instrument,  when unexplained, is strong evidence tending to establish the fact that the utterer  either himself  forged the instrument or caused it to be forged, and that this evidence, taken together with the further evidence set out above and brought out on the trial of the case, establishes the guilt of the accused of the crime with which he was charged beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>It is  urged on appeal that the information filed  in this case is fatally deficient because it charges the accused with falsification and further alleges that he received the sum of money realized as a result of said falsification, and it is contended that the accused was thus charged as principal and as accessory after the fact.   It is sufficient answer to this contention to say that no objection was raised on this ground at the trial; and it is further to be observed that this allegation was not in fact or intention a charge against the accused as accessory after the fact, and appears to have been set out in the information  merely to fix the civil responsibility  upon  which  the court is required to pass, under the provisions of the Spanish Penal Code.</p>
<p>The trial  court was  of  opinion  that the aggravating circumstances  of  premeditation and abuse of  confidence should be taken into  consideration in fixing the penalty to be imposed, but we agree with the Solicitor-General that premeditation  is  inherently  involved  in crimes of this nature, and  since it does not appear that the check book was under the control  or intrusted  to the care of the accused, the  crime can not be said to have been  committed with "abuse  of confidence"  within the meaning  of circumstance 10 of article 10 of the Penal Code.</p>
<p>We therefore reverse the judgment and sentence  of the trial court and find the accused, Pio Castillo, guilty of the crime of "falsification of  a  mercantile instrument,"  as charged, and it appearing that the accused, at the time of the  commission of the  crime,  was less than  18 though more than 15 years old, we impose upon him the penalty immediately  inferior to that  prescribed for that offense, and there being no aggravating  or extenuating circumstances,  we sentence the said Pio Castillo to four  years' imprisonment  (<span style="font-style: italic;">presidio correccional</span>)  with  the accessory penalties prescribed by  law,  and to the payment of the costs in  both  instances and the indemnification  of the injured party in the sum of 56 pesos, Philippine currency.</p>
<p>After the expiration of ten days let judgment be entered in accordance herewith and at the proper time let the case be remanded to the court  below  for  proper action.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C.  J., Torres, Johnson,  Willard,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
