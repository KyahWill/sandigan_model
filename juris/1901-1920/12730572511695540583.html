				<BR><STRONG>TRENT, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Cristobal Grospe, alias Cayetano Asuncion, was charged in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Tarlac with the crime of falsification of a private document.&nbsp; After due trial&nbsp; he was&nbsp; found guilty as charged&nbsp; and sentenced to one year eight&nbsp; months and twenty-one days of <i>presidio correccional,</i> to pay a&nbsp; fine of 625 pesetas, to suffer&nbsp; the corresponding&nbsp; subsidiary imprisonment in&nbsp; case&nbsp; of&nbsp; insolvency, and to pay the costs of&nbsp; the cause.&nbsp;&nbsp; From that judgment he appealed.<br><br>In the month of&nbsp; April, 1909, the defendant was employed by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Tarlac Railway Company as <i>capataz </i>in charge of the laborers on the road.&nbsp; As&nbsp; such employee he was under obligation to turn&nbsp; over daily to the superintendent of&nbsp; the company a list showing the names of the laborers under his charge. In compliance with this&nbsp; obligation he made&nbsp; out and signed Exhibit A, which is the daily time report for the 20th of April.&nbsp;&nbsp; According to this report, the&nbsp; defendant had eleven laborers in his gang on that day and upon this report these eleven men were paid, at a fixed rate, for their services". It later developed that only five out of the eleven&nbsp; men had worked for the railroad company on the 20th&nbsp; of April. By reason of this false report, made by the defendant,&nbsp; the railroad company&nbsp; paid six&nbsp; men for&nbsp; services&nbsp; which they never performed, thereby prejudicing the&nbsp; company to&nbsp; the amount of the wages paid these six laborers for that day. The first explanation given&nbsp; by the defendant as to why he included these&nbsp; six names when in fact&nbsp; only&nbsp; five had worked was that he was induced to do so by one Narciso Cordero, while on the trial he&nbsp; changed this statement and insisted that the eleven men named in this private document did actually work on the 20th of April.&nbsp; It has been clearly shown, however, that only five&nbsp; of these eleven men worked on that date.<br><br>Previous to this time the defendant had been an employee of the same company, and,&nbsp; according to a&nbsp; statement made by him to one Thomas Embry,&nbsp; he had been dismissed on account&nbsp; of having stolen&nbsp; certain&nbsp; property belonging&nbsp; to the company, and that he&nbsp; changed his name to Cayetano Asuncion to avoid detection.<br><br>Article 304 of the Penal Code&nbsp; provides as follows:<br><blockquote>"He who, to the prejudice of a&nbsp; third person or with intent of causing it, shall, in a private document, commit any of the falsifications specified in article 300 shall be punished with the penalties of <span style="font-style: italic;">presidio correccional</span> in its minimum and&nbsp; medium&nbsp; degrees&nbsp; and a&nbsp; fine&nbsp; of&nbsp; from 625 to&nbsp; 6,250 pesetas."</blockquote>Article 300 of the same code provides, in part, as follows:<br><blockquote>"The penalties of <span style="font-style: italic;">cadena temporal&nbsp;</span> and&nbsp; a fine of from 1,250 to 12,500 pesetas shall be imposed on a public official who, taking advantage of his authority, shall commit a falsification.<br><br>"2. By including in any act the participation of persons who had no such participation.<br><br>"4. By perverting the truth in&nbsp; the narration of facts."</blockquote>The&nbsp; defendant not only included in his report the names of these&nbsp; six men as having worked on that day when, in fact, they did not work, but by&nbsp; so&nbsp; doing he perverted the truth in the narration&nbsp; of facts.&nbsp; There was not only an intent&nbsp; to prejudice and damage&nbsp; the company by this act, but actual&nbsp; damage or loss was sustained by the company, inasmuch as it has been shown&nbsp; that the company parted with its&nbsp; money when it paid&nbsp; these six men by reason of this false report.<br><br>The judgment of the lower court being in accordance with the law&nbsp; and the merits of the&nbsp; case, the same is hereby affirmed, with costs against the&nbsp; appellant: Provided, however, That he be also&nbsp; sentenced to the corresponding accessory penalties as provided by law.<br><br><i>Arellano, C.J., Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson</i>, and <i>Moreland, JJ.</i>, concur.<br></div>
