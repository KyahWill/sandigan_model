				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On the 9th of July,&nbsp; 1908, while&nbsp; Ricardo Samson was walking&nbsp; through a street of the town of Santa Rosa, Province of Nueva Ecija, with a&nbsp; shotgun and nine cartridges in his custody,&nbsp; the gun and&nbsp; the&nbsp; ammunition were seized by some&nbsp; municipal policemen.<br><br>The Court of&nbsp; First Instance&nbsp; of the said province sentenced him to pay a fine of P50, or to subsidiary imprisonment, in case of insolvency, at the rate of one day for each P2.50, and costs.<br><br>It was proved&nbsp; that the defendant, while traveling on foot, was carrying a shotgun that belonged to Pablo Padilla.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was also shown&nbsp; that Pablo Padilla had a proper permit to possess the arm, and that&nbsp; the defendant&nbsp; was carrying&nbsp; the gun at the time because Pablo&nbsp; Padilla had sent him on ahead&nbsp; with it, as the latter&nbsp; was going on foot and&nbsp; the former was to follow him on horseback, to hunt.<br><blockquote>"But had you arranged with him to&nbsp; meet him&nbsp; somewhere?" asked the fiscal.<br><br>"Answer. Yes, sir.<br><br>"Q. At the place where he was apprehended?<br><br>"A. Yes,&nbsp; sir.<br><br>"Q. Does the shotgun that was taken by the police from the possession of Samson belong to you ?<br><br>"A. Yes, sir.<br><br>"Q. Is the permit in your name?<br><br>"A. Yes, sir, the permit so states.<br><br>"THE FISCAL. That is all."</blockquote>The custody which the&nbsp; defendant Samson&nbsp; had&nbsp; of&nbsp; the arm was not with the intention of possessing it.&nbsp; Carrying a gun by order of the owner does not constitute illegal possession&nbsp; of&nbsp; firearms.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; defendant is acquitted&nbsp; of&nbsp; the charge.<br><br>The judgment&nbsp; appealed from is reversed, with the costs of both instances <span style="font-style: italic;">de oficio</span>.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Torres, Johnson, Moreland,</i> and <i>Trent, JJ.</i>, concur.<br></div>
