				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> The bill of  exceptions  in  this case contains the  complaint, answer, and judgment.   It states that the defendant excepted to the judgment,  and that he  took no  other exception  during all the proceedings  in  the court below. He now moves this  court that the bill  of  exceptions be amended  by  adding thereto all the evidence taken at the trial.</p>
<p> In the  exercise of its appellate  jurisdiction this  court considers three classes of cases, namely, appeals in  criminal cases, appeals in  special  proceedings,  and bills of exceptions.</p>
<p> In a prosecution for a public offense it considers  upon an appeal all  the  evidence adduced  in the court below, besides both  questions of law and fact, and forms its own opinions as to the guilt or innocence of the accused.   The practice has not been changed  in  this respect  from that which existed during the Spanish domination.   In criminal cases of this  character it  is  necessary that all the evidence be returned to this court.</p>
<p> In appeals in special proceedings, this court has also by the provision of the Code of Civil Procedure now in force the power to pass  upon all  questions both of  law and fact, (Act 498.)</p>
<p> The Code indicates what parts of the evidence are to be returned to this court in the different classes of appeals in special  proceedings.   (Arts. 779, 781,782.)</p>
<p> But in ordinary civil actions the power of this court on appeal has been limited and its practice radically changed. It has become for such cases only a court for the  correction of errors of law, and no longer, except in the three cases mentioned in article  497, has  the power to pass  upon questions of  fact raised  by the testimony.  The article says: "The Supreme Court shall not review the evidence taken in the court below,  nor retry the questions of fact."</p>
<p> Outside  of the three excepted cases mentioned in said article 497,  our power in cases like the one  at bar is limited to  a consideration of error of law committed by the court below.  And, moreover, we are allowed to consider such errors of law  only when  they have  been duly excepted to.</p>
<p> If no errors of law are committed during the progress of the case  or  in  the judgment,  it will not  avail  the defeated party to bring it here on the ground that  the judge should have believed his witnesses rather than those of the other side, unless  his case falls within the exceptions mentioned in  said article 497.   Neither will it avail him to bring the case here, even  if errors  of  law were committed, unless he duly excepted to the erroneous rulings of the court at the time they were made.</p>
<p> In the case at  bar it appears that the defendant excepted to the judgment which the court  rendered.  Upon that exception he is entitled to discuss here the question  as to whether or not, assuming that the  facts recited in  the judgment are true, the plaintiff was  entitled as a matter of  law to recover the amount of $1,035.40 and interest. He is entitled to argue that the facts stated by the judge do not justify the judgment ordered by him.   Upon such an exception he can not argue that the facts are not as stated by the judge.   He can  not go into the question as to  whether upon the evidence the judge should not have found the facts  the other way.   The case does not come within any of tjie three exceptions mentioned in  article 497,  and we  are, therefore, expressly  forbidden  to retry questions of fact.  So that, even if the evidence which  the appellant asked  to have sent up  were  all here, we would have no power to consider it.   Neither  would we have any power to examine it for the purpose of seeing if the court committed  any  error  of law  in  receiving or excluding evidence, for  the bill of exceptions states that the defendant took no exceptions to such erroneous rulings, if any there were.</p>
<p> For the reasons above stated the motion is denied.  The appellant is allowed thirty days  from the entry of  this order in which to file and transmit copies of  his brief to the adverse party.</p>
<p> <em>Arellano, C. J., Cooper,  Smith, Mapa,</em> and <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em>Torres, J.,</em> withdrew from this case.</p>
