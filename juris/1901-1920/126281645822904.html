				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is an action brought by C. M. Cotterman to compel the defendants, who are conflicting claimants to 3,020 pesos,  Mexican currency, in which he disclaims all interest and which he has deposited with the clerk of the Court of First Instance of the city of  Manila, to interplead  and litigate their several  claims among themselves.</p>
<p>The defendant surety companies contend that this money was paid over to the plaintiff as Director of Posts, or to one of his agents as such, by one W. Schultze, postmaster at Laoag, as part of the funds of his office; that, nevertheless, the said funds were not credited upon the official accounts of the said  Schultze; that the said surety companies have been compelled to  make good the shortage in the funds of the said Schultze, postmaster, amounting to considerably more than  the said  sum of  3,020 pesos, Mexican currency, and  that it was and  is the duty of the said plaintiff, as Director of Posts, to credit the account of the said  Schultze, postmaster, with the fund in question and to refund to the defendant surety companies  the amount thereof.</p>
<p>The  defendants, other than the surety companies, allege that the funds in question  were paid over by them to the said Schultze, postmaster  of Laoag,  for  the purpose of buying postal money orders on Manila; that the plaintiff, as Director of Posts, through his agents, took possession of these funds and of the post-office at Laoag and suspended the said postmaster before these postal orders were issued; that the said plaintiff, as  Director of Posts, unlawfully refused and has continued unlawfully to refuse to issue these orders as requested or to permit his agents so to do, or to make return of the  funds thus deposited with the postmaster of Laoag.</p>
<p>The evidence of record discloses that on the morning of the 18th of July, 1903, the said Schultze went to the defendants, other than the surety companies, and informed them that the mail for Manila would be made up that day and that if they desired to send money orders to  Manila they should make application therefor at the earliest possible moment so that he  might have sufficient time  to prepare  the proper papers and get his mail and  reports ready in due time;  that the defendants, other than the surety companies, did in fact  make application on that morning for postal orders  to the amount of 3,020 pesos, Mexican currency, and turned over the funds in question to the said Schultze,  postmaster, in payment therefor; that the postal money  orders were  not issued forthwith, but instead a memorandum receipt  was issued for the amount turned over by each applicant, Schultze promising to have the postal money orders ready at some time that afternoon, explaining the delay by stating that he  was too busy  at that time to fill out the forms and prepare the orders.</p>
<p>It further appears that at an early hour of the same day Post-Office Inspector Ladd  arrived at Laoag; that he proceeded forthwith to inspect  the accounts of the postmaster, found a  considerable shortage,  and took possession of all of the funds belonging to the office; that the funds in question were found in a place apart on the money-order table of the post-office and that  at first Schultze informed the inspector that these  funds were the proceeds of  money orders already issued; that a few hours later when the inspector had verified the books and found that no such orders had in fact  been issued, Schultze confessed that he was short in his accounts and stated that these funds had been paid in that morning for postal orders which he had promised to issue that afternoon.</p>
<p>The defendant surety companies insist that these funds were in fact loaned by the other defendants to their friend the postmaster to be used by him in concealing his shortage while the inspector was counting the funds of the office and to be repaid later, either in cash or postal money orders on Manila; that the said loan was accepted by Schultze and by him merged with the funds of  the post-office and as such taken into possession  by  the  inspector;  that Schultze, having turned over these funds as part of the post-office funds, had no right or authority to reclaim them, it appearing that he was indebted to the Government in an amount in excess thereof, and that the defendants have no claim upon the Government for the return of said funds or for postal money, orders in exchange therefor because, as it is alleged, they loaned the money to Schultze for his personal use and their right of action for the return thereof is limited to him.</p>
<p>This  view of the case was accepted  by the trial court and  judgment  rendered in  favor of the defendant  surety companies, but we are of opinion that  the finding of the trial court that these funds were a personal loan to Schultze for the purpose of aiding him in concealing his shortage is plainly and manifestly against the weight of the evidence; indeed there is no evidence whatever to support this contention other than the mere fact that when these funds were paid  over to  the postmaster and application made for money orders in exchange therefor, the applicants did not insist upon  immediate issue but agreed to wait his  convenience on  his representation that he was very busy and could not prepare them until later.</p>
<p>There is no evidence to show that the applicants knew that there was  a shortage to conceal; there is no evidence to show that they knew that an inspector had  put in his appearance who might discover  such shortage,  and while it is clear that Schultze deliberately planned to conceal his shortage by inducing them to turn in these funds and wait for the issue of the postal money orders in exchange therefor, there is nothing in the  transaction  so irregular or so unusual or so much out of the ordinary course of business as to justify so violent a presumption as that these defendants conspired  with him for the purpose of concealing his crime.  It may be that the contention  of the surety companies is founded on fact; and if it appeared that the defendants had any knowledge of the existence of a shortage at the time when these  transactions took place  it would be difficult, in view of all the evidence, to avoid the conclusion that these funds were loaned to Schultze as an act of mistaken friendship;  but it must be remembered that the existence of that shortage, which is admitted and known to all men today, was a thing which at  that time Schultze would naturally make every effort to conceal from all those with whom he was transacting official business.</p>
<p>The copy of a copy of the receipt to Jose Castro, which is filed as an exhibit in the case, varies in form and date from the copies of the receipts which appear to have been given to the other defendants, and this variation would seem to suggest that his claim for 460 pesos should be placed on a different  basis than those of the  rest of the defendants, other than the surety companies; however, as counsel for the surety companies did not appear to  have considered the variation in form as of any essential importance and made no point thereon, either on the trial or on this appeal, and since all of the evidence in the  record as submitted by both parties tends to show that the transaction represented by the receipt given to him was substantially identical with those represented by the other receipts of record; and since the originals of these receipts are not before us, we think that this variation in form must be attributed to a mistake in copying or to some other cause unknown which should not have  the effect of putting the claim of Castro on a different basis from that of the other claimants.</p>
<p>The judgment of the trial court should be reversed without special condemnation  of  costs, and  after deducting from the funds in question the amount of the costs of these proceedings, they  should be divided  <em>pro-rata</em> among the defendant claimants,  other than the surety companies, in proportion to the amounts delivered to Schultze as set out in the pleadings. </p>
<p>After ten days let  judgment be  entered in accordance herewith and the record returned to the court from whence it came, where the proper orders will be made for the distribution of the funds.  So ordered.</p>
