				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. VICENTE MADRIGAL ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MORELAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The appellants in this case were 
charged in the court below with a violation of the short-weight provision of Act 
No. 1519, section 30. They were convicted and each of them sentenced to pay a 
fine of P200 and one-fourth of the costs, with subsidiary imprisonment in case 
of failure to pay the fine imposed.</p>
<p>The defendants were partners doing business under the firm style and name of 
Madrigal &amp; Co., their principal business being the selling of coal at 
retail. The offices of the company were located at No. 1059 Muelle de la 
Industria, and their coal yard from which all orders for coal were filled was 
located about one mile distant. The orders for coal were received at the office 
and were telephoned from there to the weigher at the coal-yard, who thereupon 
weighed out the quantity of coal ordered and placed it upon the wagon for 
delivery. This was the practice followed in the case before us. On the 1st day 
of November, 1911, one Lee Tai gave an order to said company for the delivery at 
his restaurant at the Young Men's Christian Association in the city of Manila of 
1 ton of coal. This order was immediately transmitted from the company's office 
to its coal yard and filled by the weigher weighing out the quantity ordered and 
placing it upon the wagon for delivery. In this particular instance a full ton 
of coal was not delivered, there being about 140 kilos short. A complaint was 
made against the four partners individually for a violation of section 30 of Act 
No. 1519 and a separate criminal information was filed against them. They were 
tried, convicted and sentenced as aforesaid.</p>
<p>The section alleged to have been violated reads, so far as is material to 
this case, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Any person who, with fraudulent intent, alters any scale or balance, weight 
or measure, after it is officially sealed, or who knowingly uses any false scale 
or balance, weight or measure, whether sealed or not, <em>or who fraudulently 
represents the weight or measure of anything to be greater or less than it 
is,</em> shall be punished by a fine of not less than two hundred pesos, nor 
more than four thousand pesos, or by imprisonment for not less than three 
months, nor more than two years, or by both such fine and imprisonment, in the 
discretion of the court."</p></blockquote>
<p>The position of the prosecution as stated in its brief is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The prosecution contends that the evidence discloses an absolutely clear-cut 
situation: An order was given Madrigal &amp; Co. for one ton of coal; in 
response to the order a delivery was made, accompanied by an invoice presented 
to the purchaser, representing that the delivery contained one ton of coal; the 
coal was accepted by the purchaser and subsequently, upon presentation of a bill 
representing that one ton had been delivered, the purchaser paid for one ton of 
coal; the delivery was not a full ton as represented by the invoice and bill. . 
These facts give rise to two questions: (1) Is this a 'fraudulent 
representation' as set forth in the statement? (2) Can the defendants be held 
criminally, responsible for this 'fraudulent representation?'</p>
<p>"The prosecution contends that such a representation is a fraudulent one as 
intended by the legislature. It is clear that the statute was never intended to 
penalize innocent misrepresentation of weights or measures. For example, a 
statute would be absurd, if it attempted to penalize a very fat man, who 
jestingly remarks that his true weight is only 103 pounds. So also if a person 
in a conversation erroneously states that the weight of a sack of rice is 2 
cavans. But when something depends upon the correctness of the statement, when 
some one will be liable to pecuniary loss if the statement of weight is untrue, 
then we contend that under certain circumstances, such a statement would be a 
fraudulent representation within the statute, irrespective of any intent on the 
part of the person making it. In the case at bar, the mere fact of sending out a 
short delivery with a false invoice, is sufficient to constitute a fraud upon 
the purchaser and to be a fraudulent representation within the language of this 
clause of the section.</p>
<p>"It is true as a general rule that intent is an element necessary to 
constitute a fraud (23 Am. Dig., 1645). But this does not necessarily require 
that one who makes a fraudulent representation must have an actual specific 
intent to defraud. Even at common law, if A makes a misrepresentation regarding 
the financial responsibility of B, or that B is the payee of a note, whereby C 
is induced to advance money or credit, A is responsible for his statements and a 
fraudulent intent is imputed to him, either because he acts carelessly and 
without investigation, when investigation could be made (Nevada Bank 
<em>vs.</em> Portland Nat. Bank, C. C, 59 Fed., 338), or because his statement 
was about a matter of which he had special knowledge (Labay <em>vs.</em> City 
Nat. Bank, 15 Colo., 339, 25 Pac, 704)."</p></blockquote>
<p>We cannot agree with this argument when applied to a criminal action brought 
under the statute above quoted.</p>
<p>The statute uses the word "fraudulently." In the sense in which that word is 
generally used in law and from the definition of it which has become generally 
accepted, knowledge on the part of the person charged must be shown before a 
conviction can be had. <em>Fraudulently</em> selling coal short means knowingly 
selling it short weight. This, in turn, means that the party charged must 
himself sell the coal or it must be done by some other person through his 
induction or with his knowledge or consent.<br><br>The cases of United States 
<em>vs.</em> Tria (17 Phil. Rep., 303), and United States <em>vs.</em> Estavillo 
(19 Phil. Rep., 478), cited by the Solicitor-General in support of the 
conviction, do not, in our judgment, touch the question at issue. Neither do the 
decisions of this court relative to criminal libel. A special provision of the 
libel law makes the owner or proprietor responsible regardless of knowledge. No 
cases have been cited holding the proposition laid down by the prosecution, and 
we have been unable to find any. All the cases called to our attention or which 
we have been able to find are to the contrary. The supreme court of Minnesota 
has discussed a situation quite similar to that here presented. Section 5115 of 
the Revised Laws of 1905 of Minnesota<br>reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>''Every person who shall injure or defraud another by using with knowledge 
that the same is false, a false weight, measure or other apparatus for 
determining the quantity of any commodity or article of merchandise, or by 
knowingly delivering less than the quantity he represents; or who shall retain 
in his possession any weight or measure, knowing it to be false, unless it 
appears beyond a reasonable doubt that it was so retained without intent to use 
it, or permit it to be used, in violation of the foregoing provisions of this 
section ; or who shall knowingly mark or stamp false or short weights or false 
tare on any cask or package, or knowingly sell or offer for sale any cask or 
package so marked shall be guilty of a misdemeanor."</p></blockquote>
<p>This section was amended, repealed, or substituted by section 6 of chapter 
156 of the Laws of 1911 of that State, which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Any person who shall offer or expose for sale, sell, or use, or have in his 
possession a false scale, weight or measure, or weighing or measuring device, or 
any weight or measure or weighing or measuring device which has not been sealed 
within one year, as provided by this law, or use the same in buying or selling 
of any commodity or thing; or who shall dispose of any condemned weight, measure 
or weighing or measuring device, or remove any tag placed thereon by any 
authorized employee of the department, or shall sell or offer or expose for sale 
less than the quantity he represents; or sell or offer or expose for sale any 
such commodities in the manner contrary to law; or shall sell or offer for sale 
or have in his possession for the. purpose of selling, any device or instrument 
to be used to, or calculated to, falsify any weight or measure, or shall refuse 
to pay any fee charged for testing and sealing or condemning any scale, weight 
or measure, or weighing or measuring device, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, * 
* * "</p></blockquote>
<p>It will be noticed that the real difference, so far as we are at present 
concerned, between the two sections quoted is that in the one knowledge, that 
is, fraud, is required and in the other it is not. Speaking of that difference 
the supreme court in the case of State <em>vs.</em> Armour &amp; Co. (118 Minn., 
128), said, at page 131:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is at once apparent, on reading this section, that fraud is of its 
essence. On the other hand, it is equally apparent from the reading of the Act 
of 1911, that the things there penalized are <em>mala prohibita,</em> pure and 
simple, of which, in the contemplation of the law, intent to defraud or commit 
wrong is not an element. It is in this difference between the two Acts that, in 
our opinion, the purpose of the legislature in incorporating in the Act of 1911 
the provision in question is to be found. In other words, the legislature wished 
to dispense with the difficult, and often insuperable, task of proving 
intentional wrongdoing on the part of the seller."</p></blockquote>
<p>Expressing its final conclusion upon the effect of the Act of 1911 the court 
said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We hold that the Act of 1911 is broad enough to cover any case where a sale, 
offer to sell, or exposure for sale of less than actually represented is 
charged."</p></blockquote>
<p>This decision was under review in the case of State vs. People's Ice Co. (144 
N. W; Rep., 962), where a similar question was involved. In that case the court 
said, quoting from State<em> vs.</em> Sharp (121 Minn., 381):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The question of intent is not material in this class of statutory offenses. 
Such statutes are in the nature of police regulations and impose a penalty 
irrespective of intent to violate them, the object being to require a degree of 
diligence for the protection of the public which shall render violation 
impossible."</p></blockquote>
<p>The court also quotes from State <em>vs.</em> Armour and, speaking with 
reference to section 5115 as compared with section€ of the Act of 1911, 
says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Under this Act (referring to section 5115 of the laws of 1905), knowledge 
and intent were ingredients of the offense. Changing the law so as to omit the 
element of knowledge indicates that the legislature intended to eliminate the 
question of intent as an element of the offense."</p></blockquote>
<p>From these cases it is clear that, as the section originally stood, 
conviction could not have been had under it without showing guilty knowledge in 
the selling of the goods; in other words, the defendant must have been shown to 
have knowledge of the misrepresentation. This necessity was recognized by the 
legislature and that difficulty was removed by the Act of 1911. Under that Act 
conviction can now be had without proof of knowledge.</p>
<p>The difference between the two laws of Minnesota, as set out in the two cases 
cited, presents in relief the precise question before us, especially in view of 
section 181 of Act No. 2339, passed February 27, 1914, to take effect on and 
after July 1,1914. Under the wording of the statute the provisions of which we 
are considering, knowledge is an essential ingredient of the crime and no 
conviction can be had without showing knowledge.</p>
<p>It is the undisputed evidence that not one of the defendants had any 
knowledge that the clerk was delivering a less quantity than that asked for. The 
accused have not been connected by the evidence of the prosecution with the sale 
in any guilty sense and are not shown to have made a misrepresentation or 
committed a fraud, or of having been privy thereto. As a necessary result the 
conviction cannot be sustained.</p>
<p>In order to demonstrate such knowledge, or to present evidence from which it 
could be inferred, the prosecution, on the trial, sought to introduce evidence 
of short-weight sales which had been made by the partnership before and after 
the one set out in the information. This evidence was excluded by the court 
below as incompetent under the objection of the defendants. We regard this 
ruling as error. Under the theory upon which we are deciding this case, 
knowledge is, as we have just stated, a necessary element, and any evidence 
tending to demonstrate such knowledge is not only competent and material but 
very important. One of the means of establishing knowledge on a prosecution for 
a short-weight sale is to show other sales in which the purchasers were 
short-weighted, occurring either before or after the sale which is the basis of 
the action in which the evidence is offered, thereby establishing that the 
company systematically gave short weight.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from is reversed and the appellants acquitted.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Carson, Trent,</em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.,</em>
