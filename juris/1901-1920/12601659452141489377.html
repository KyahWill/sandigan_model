				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MCDONOUGH, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The defendant is charged with the crime of treason, committed as follows:
<p>That on November 21, 1902, in Manila, he did feloniously, treasonably, etc., 
levy war against, adhere to and give aid and comfort to the enemies of, the 
United States and of the Philippine Islands, in that on or about August 30, 
1902, he accepted a commission in the regular army of the "Filipino republic" 
and served as a captain and carried arms in such army and continued in such 
office and continued to carry arms as aforesaid between the said dates of August 
30, 1902, and November 21, 1902, the said "Filipino republic" being an attempted 
government organized by various persons against the authority of the United 
States Government and that of the Philippine Islands and having for its object 
the overthrow by armed insurrection of the regularly constituted government in 
said Islands.</p>
<p>The defendant was convicted in the Court of First Instance of Manila and 
sentenced to imprisonment for a term of twenty years and to pay a fine of 
$5,000.</p>
<p>The evidence upon which the court below based this conviction is 
substantially as follows:</p>
<p>A Constabulary detective testified that he met the defendant in Bacord, city 
of Manila, November 21, 1902; that a companion of the witness told him that the 
defendant was a captain in the Katipunan Society; that thereupon they detained 
the defendant and took him aside into a clump of trees where they talked to him 
and got him to admit that he was an officer of the Katipunan. The officers took 
the defendant to his house, where they searched his trunk and found in it and 
took away a revolver and a captain's commission, under seals. The following is a 
copy.of this commission:</p>
<p align="center">"SUPREME PRESIDENCY OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.</p>
<p>"By reason of the qualifications of Antonio de los Reyes and the good service 
rendered by him to the fatherland, the supreme president has seen fit to appoint 
him captain in the regular army of these Islands.</p>
<p>"It is therefore ordered that all persons render him the corresponding honors 
and obey all orders which he may issue for the good of the service.</p>

<p>This Constabulary detective further testified that one Cenon Nigdao was a 
lieutenant-colonel in command of the whole Katipunan forces, but at that time 
had been captured and was a prisoner at Pasig.</p>
<p>The witness was asked what this Katipunan Society is, and in reply stated 
that it is an organization for forming an independent government for the 
Philippines, not letting their headquarters or whereabouts be known to the 
American Government, and to gain forces and arms by any means they can; 
sometimes they use force in securing members.</p>
<p>When asked if he knew any of the armed forces of the society, he said that 
they made an attack on May 30 upon a Government force of the United States Army. 
He said he had not seen the defendant with the insurgent forces.</p>
<p>Another witness for the prosecution testified that he had been informed of 
this so-called government known as the Tagalog republic, or Katipunan, through 
captured documents; that they had armed forces approximating 300 men, and that 
he knew their seals and recognized the seals on Exhibit A, the commission of the 
defendant, as those of the organization.</p>
<p>The next witness called by the prosecution was Cenon Nigdao, who stated that 
he was a tailor, 28 years of age, and secretary of war of the Katipunan. He 
identified the signatures on Exhibit A. He stated that the Katipunan is the 
national party. Its purpose is to defend the rights of the country and to ask of 
the American Government the freedom of this country.</p>
<p>He further stated that when he gave this commission to the defendant he told 
him to keep it, and when the time came for them to ask for liberty the people 
could not do him any harm. </p>
<p>The witness named the secretary of the National party, the minister of the 
interior, the minister of state, minister of war, and minister of justice of the 
association.</p>
<p>On cross-examination this " secretary of war," who had held office only for 
one week, testified that he commanded no forces; did not know that defendant 
made any use of his commission; that they did not take up arms because they were 
here in Manila; and that he was living in the same house with the defendant and 
gave him the commission there.</p>
<p>Another witness sworn for the prosecution stated that he was not a member of 
the Katipunan, but was a member of the National party ever since he left Bilibid 
Prison; that the " secretary of war " appointed him a lieutenant-colonel and he 
held the commission three months but had no soldiers to command; and that there 
was no army when Cenon Nigdao was living at Bacord.</p>
<p>He said he was sent out to Baliuag by one Santiago and stayed there about 
three months, and when he found out that there was nothing doing he surrendered 
himself and one revolver to the president.</p>
<p>If we reject, as we must, the confession of the defendant made to the 
Constabulary officer, because it was not made in open court as required by law 
(sec. 9, act of Congress passed March 8, 1902), we have but very little in the 
case upon which to base a charge of treason. Even what there is&nbsp; 
contradictory. The charge is that the defendant took arms against the Government 
in the regular army of the "Philippine republic," whereas one witness for the 
prosecution swears that the Katipunan is the treasonable organization, another 
says that body is known as the " Tagalog republic," and another, the so-called 
secretary of war, who commanded no troops, but to whom the Government presumably 
gave credit because he testified for the prosecution, stated that the Katipunan 
was the " National party " and the object of that party was to obtain from the 
United States, by peaceable means, the independence of the Philippine 
Islands.</p>
<p>The confession of the accused being disposed of, the only other question to 
be considered is whether the testimony of one witness that he issued to the 
defendant the captain's commission above-mentioned, and the testimony of another 
witness that he found this commission in the defendant's trunk, is sufficient to 
satisfy the requirements of the statute that "no person in the Philippine 
Islands shall under the authority of the United States be convicted of treason * 
* * unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act * * *."</p>
<p>There is no proof whatever that the accused did any other act in connection 
with this charge than to receive this commission. On the contrary the " secretary of war " testified that they did not take up arms because they 
remained here in Manila.</p>
<p>I am of the opinion that the mere acceptance of the commission by the 
defendant, nothing else being done, was not an overt act of treason within the 
meaning of the law. Blackstone says that " as treason is the highest civil crime 
which (considered as a member of the community) any man can possibly commit, it 
ought, therefore, to be the most freely ascertained."</p>
<p>The state of affairs disclosed by the evidence—the playing of the game of 
government, like children, the secretaries and colonels and captains, the 
pictures of flags and seals and commissions all on paper, for the purpose of 
duping and misleading the ignorant and the vicious—should not be dignified by 
the name of treason.</p>
<p>Those engaged in this plotting and scheming in the pretense of establishing 
an independent government in these Islands, with nothing behind them, without 
arms or soldiers or money, and without the possibility of success, are simply 
engaged in deluding themselves and perhaps innocent followers and in filling the 
cells of Bilibid Prison.</p>
<p>Even though not guilty of treason, they may be tried for other lesser 
crimes.</p>
<p>The case of the United States <em>vs.</em> Magtibay,<span class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> recently decided by this court, involved much 
the same question as this, and is followed.</p>
<p>The judgment below is therefore reversed and the defendant acquitted, but 
without prejudice to the prosecuting authorities to proceed against the 
defendant for such other crime or crimes as the evidence discloses. The costs 
are adjudged <em>de oficio.</em></p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Willard,</em> and <em>Mapa, JJ.,</em> 
concur.<br><em>Johnson, J.,</em> disqualified.<br><br></p>
