				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> This is a motion to  dismiss  the appeal of the United States taken from  a judgment rendered August 15,  1902, by the Court of First Instance of Batangas, acquitting the appellee,of the crime of robbery.</p>
<p> The question presented by the motion, namely, whether the Government  is entitled, under the laws now in  force in the Philippine Islands,  to an  appeal to this court in criminal cases from a judgment of acquittal of a Court of First Instance  has been already passed upon  in the case of the The United States vs. Kepner in a decision rendered October 11, 1902.  In an earlier decision in the same case (February 6, 1902)  we had held that under the law as it stood prior to the enactment by Congress  of the Philippines Bill, the Government was entitled  to an appeal in the  class  of  cases in question, and  in  the  decision of October 11, 1902, we held that such right of appeal of the Government remained unaffected by the provisions of that act.  Both these decisions were  made after  full argument and  consideration, and we adhere to them, without deeming it necessary at this time to review the grounds upon which they were based.</p>
<p> One point made by counsel for  the appellee upon the argument of this motion may, however, be briefly noticed, as it has perhaps not been heretofore suggested.  Counsel contends,  if we correctly apprehend his position, that the jurisdiction of this court, as defined in the  law by which the court was created (Act No.  136. of the. Commission) is of such a nature as necessarily to exclude the idea that the court  can, like its predecessor, the Spanish Audiencia, review the whole case upon appeal;  that the "appellate jurisdiction" conferred upon it ,by Act No. 136 is <em>ex vi termini</em> a jurisdiction to correct errors of law merely.</p>
<p> This contention is, we think,  founded on a misconception. By section 18 of Act No. 136 it is provided that "The Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction of all actions and special proceedings properly brought to it from Courts of First Instance, and from other tribunals from whose judgment the law shall specially provide an appeal to the Supreme Court."   The term "appellate jurisdiction" is  here used in a general  sense,  meaning simply a jurisdiction to review the judgment of the inferior court.   Whether  the jurisdiction  is  to  reexamine the facts, or the law, or both, and With what limitations and under what conditions, is left undetermined  by section 18, except as  it is provided that it is to  be exercised  in "all actions  and special proceedings properly brought  to it" from the  tribunals described.   To ascertain  what cases may  be properly brought to the Supreme Court for review and what matters may be reviewed in such cases, reference must be had to other provisions of law.  By section 39 of the  same Act "the existing Audiencia or supreme court" was "abolished" and this court "substituted in place thereof."  Being substituted in place of the1 existing Audiencia, clearly its jurisdiction was the same as that tribunal possessed unless and until otherwise provided. Nowhere in Act No. 136 is its appellate jurisdiction defined as respects either civil or criminal cases.  It was thus left exactly as it stood prior to the passage of that Act.  In civil cases it remained that of the Audiencia until the change effected by the Code of Civil Procedure.  In criminal cases  the Commission  has not seen  fit  tip to the  present time to modify it, and it therefore still remains identical with that exercised by the Audiencia.</p>
<p> If any doubt could be  entertained that the intention of the Commission in the  enactment of Act No. 186 was to preserve unaltered in this court the appellate jurisdiction of the Audiencia in criminal cases,  it would be removed  by Act No.  194,  section 4, amending  General Orders, No. 58, with reference to<em> consultas</em>  in such cases, in the enactment  of which the Commission  must be presumed to have had in contemplation all its prior legislation on the same general subject,  and in which the right of appeal of both the defendant and the Government is distinctly recognized.   The motion is denied.</p>
