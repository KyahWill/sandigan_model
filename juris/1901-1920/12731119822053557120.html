				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. VICENTE GARCIA GAVIERES, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Section 26 of Act No. 1780 provides that "it shall be unlawful for any person 
to carry concealed about his person any bowie knife, dirk, dagger, kris, or 
other deadly weapon * * *." The last mentioned term, "deadly weapon," has been 
defined as "any weapon which is likely, from the use made of it at the time, to 
produce death or do great bodily harm." (1 Words and Phrases, Second Series, p. 
1219, citing demons <em>vs</em>. State [1904], 48 Fla. 9, quoting 2 Bish. New 
Cr. Law, par. 680, and Bish., St. Crimes, par. 320.) Some statutes mention 
"brass knuckles" as a weapon which shall not be carried. This Court has decided 
that the phrase "or other deadly weapon" in Act No. 1780 includes arms which are 
of a different class from those particularly specified in the law. (U. S. 
<em>vs</em>. Santo Nino [1909], 13 Phil. Rep., 141.) This is the law. 
<p>When a certain club was raided, the police discovered brass knuckles 
(<em>llave inglesa</em>) secreted in the pocket of the accused. Brass knuckles 
is defined as "a weapon worn on the hand for the purposes of offence or defence, 
so made that in hitting with the fist considerable damage is inflicted. It is 
called 'brass knuckles' because it was originally made of brass. The term is now 
used without reference to the metal of which it is made." (Rawle's Revision of 
Bouvier's Law Dictionary, quoting Patterson <em>vs</em>. The State [1879], 3 
Lea, 575.) These are the facts.</p>
<p>The question arises—Is "brass knuckles" a "deadly weapon ?" An inspection of 
the brass knuckles in question with reference to the meaning of deadly weapon 
leads us to conclude that such an implement could be used to produce great 
bodily injury. The weapon can be carried for no good purpose and could only be 
used for an evil purpose. The intention of the Legislature was to suppress the 
habit of persons going around ready for combat. We answer the question with the 
statement—brass knuckles is a deadly weapon. (State <em>vs</em>. Hall, 20 Mo. 
App., 397, can be noted as corroborative authority.)</p>
<p>Counsel for appellant further relies on the following rule: "Intent is an 
essential element of the offense of carrying a weapon. As the intent necessary 
is generally considered to be that of going armed and of having the weapon ready 
for use in case of conflict, no offense is committed where accused has no 
knowledge that the weapon is on his person, or is carrying it for a harmless 
purpose, such as to take it home from the place of purchase or repair." (40 Cyc, 
854.) Counsel should have continued with the next succeeding sentence of the 
quotation—"The requisite intent, however, is not one to violate the law but to 
do the prohibited act, as every person is presumed to know the law"— and then 
should have turned the pages to read this—"In prosecutions for carrying 
concealed weapons, the burden of proving the fact of concealment is upon the 
state; while on the other hand, it is incumbent upon defendant to show that the 
case is within one of the statutory exceptions as well as to overcome by proof 
the presumptions arising from the commission of the act." (40 Cyc, 867.) The 
prosecution having proved the fact of concealment about his person of a deadly 
weapon, the burden of establishing justification was on the defendant.</p>
<p>The judgment of the Court of First Instance of Manila sentencing the accused 
to pay a fine of P10, or to suffer subsidiary imprisonment in case of 
insolvency, and to pay the costs, is affirmed with the costs of this instance 
against the appellant. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Johnson, Street, Avanceña</em>, and <em>Fisher, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p></div>
