				G.R. No. 3980, December 20, 1907</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. RUPERTO GOROSPE  AND LORENZO GOROSPE,  DEFENDANTS, LORENZO GOROSPE, APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>These  defendants  were  charged  with  the crime of murder in the words following:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"That the said Ruperto Gorospe and Lorenzo Gorospe, on or about the 29th day of November,  1006, in the pueblo of Cabugao, Province  of  Ilocos  Sur, P. I, intentionally, illegally, and  criminally,  with treachery and known  premeditation, took the life of one Joaquin Reyes."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These defendants were  duly arrested, were brought before the court,  duly arraigned,  and  each pleaded "not guilty."</p>
<p>The lower court, after hearing the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause, found each of  the defendants guilty as "accessories  to the crime of  homicide upon the person of Joaquin lieyes,  without any modifying circumstance," and in consequence sentenced each  of the said defendants to be imprisoned for a period of two years four months and one day of <em>prision correccional</em>,  with the accessory penalties provided for by law, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P1,000 and in case of insolvency to suiter subsidiary imprisonment, corresponding to the penalty imposed, which should  not exceed one-third part of the principal penalty, and each to pay one-half the costs.  From this sentence of the  lower court the defendant Lorenzo Gorospe appealed.</p>
<p>An examination  of  the record  brought to this  court shows that the only evidence adduced  during the trial of the cause in the lower court was evidence of alleged  extrajudicial confessions made by the defendant.   These confessions should not have been admitted in evidence without first showing  that they had been made voluntarily  and without coercion.   (Sec.  4, Act  No.  (519; also cases of United States <em>vs</em>. Pascual, 2 Phil. Rep., 457; United States <em>vs</em>. De la Cruz, 5 Phil. Rep., 24.)</p>
<p>The Attorney-General  in  his brief filed in this case recommends that the judgment of the lower court be reversed. and that the defendant be discharged from the custody of the law, basing his recommendation upon  the fact that it was not proved  that  these extrajudicial confessions  had been made voluntarily and  without coercion.</p>
<p>Upon an examination of the record brought to this court, we are of the opinion, and so hold, that the judgment of the lower court should be reversed  and that  the defendant should be discharged  from the custody of  the law, unless he is held on some other  charge, with the costs of both instance  de oficlo.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano,  C.  J.,  Torres,  Mapa,  Carson, Willard,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
