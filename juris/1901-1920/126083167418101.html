				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>No motion for a new trial  was submitted to  the trial court, hence this court is precluded from an examination of the evidence of record,  for  the purpose of  reviewing the findings of fact, as set out in the decision of the trial judge.</p>
<p>The defendant is  the administratrix of  the  intestate estate of Pedro Sanchez, deceased.   On  the 22d  day of October, 1894,  the plaintiff, Benito Mojica, sold  to the said Pedro  Sanchez three pieces of real estate, situated in Manila,  and in the Province of Bulacan, for the sum of P15,000.  The sale was made  <em>con pacto de retro</em> (with a condition as to repurchase), by virtue of whieh Mojica reserved the right to repurchase the land for the selling price, within a period of four years  from the date of sale.  By the terms of the contract it was further agreed that the vendor, Mojica, was to retain possession of the real estate during the  term within which he  reserved the  right of repurchase, and was  to  pay the said Sanchez the sum of P125 per month  as  rental for its  use and occupation. Owing to the unsettled conditions prevailing at that time, the period of four years within which the vendor reserved the right off repurchase expired without his having exercised this right.  Thereafter Sanchez made the necessary <em>nota de consolidacion</em> (consolidating entry)  in the  proper registries, and thus appears  upon the land records as the absolute owner of the property in question.</p>
<p>Sometime thereafter Sanchez entered into a verbal agreement with Mojica whereby he obligated himself to resell the said property to Mojica upon request so to do, and to permit  Mojica to continue in possession of  the property provided he "continued to pay the interest" on the original purchase price of P15,000, at 10 per cent per annum.</p>
<p>Thereafter, on the  1st day of December, 1901, Sanchez and Mojica entered into a new agreement in writing  in a private document whereby Sanchez leased  the said  real estate to Mojica  for a period of ten years, for the sum of P1,800  per annum, being the interest at 12  per cent  per annum  on the sum  of P5,000, payable  in installments of P150 monthly, and agreed that Mojica was  to have  the right of repurchase for the sum  of P15,000 at the expiration of the said  period of ten  years.  Mojica thereafter continued to  pay the rental at the rate of P150 per month, which was received  by Sanchez up to the time of his death. In a document purporting to be his  last will and testament,  Sanchez  expressly  recognized Mojica's right of repurchase of said property under the terms of said contract of lease and repurchase, but this instrument was not admitted to probate as the last will and testament of Sanchez, owing to a noncompliance with the formal provisions of the Code, of Civil Procedure touching the execution of such  instruments.  Mojica continued to pay  the rent to the widow  of Pedro Sanchez after his death, she having been  named  the  executrix of the alleged will, and later appointed as  administratrix of Sanchez's estate.  In May, 1905, the defendant administratrix undertook to increase the monthly  rental to P350  per  month and refused to receive  P150 as  theretofore paid, although that amount was duly tendered.</p>
<p>This action appears to have been instituted as a result of the attempt of the defendant administratrix to increase the amount of  the monthly rental.  The  prayer of the complaint is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Therefore, the court is prayed to render judgment  declaring that the fictitious alleged sale of the land described in this complaint was in fact a loan of P15,000, with interest  at the  rate of  12 per cent per  annum, secured  by mortgage on the said property, and that the consolidation entry made in favor of Don Pedro Sanchez in the registries of Manila and of the Province of Bulacan be annulled; and, if this remedy  be not granted, that the defendant, as administratrix of the intestate estate of  Don Pedro Sanchez, be required to register  as a  public  document the private rental contract of the said lands, for a period of ten years, and the agreement to sell the same at the end of the said term, annulling at the same time the consolidation entry of ownership of the  said lands in favor of Don Pedro Sanchez, with the costs of this proceeding."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon the facts as above set out, the trial court properly held that neither the <em>venta con pacto de  retro</em> (sale with right of repurchase) nor the private document, dated September 1, 1901, could be declared to be instruments of loan or mortgage.  The contract of sale with a right to repurchase was a valid contract recognized and  authorized by law, and under its terms the purchaser was entirely within his rights when he caused the annotation in question to be entered in the proper land registries.   (Civil Code, Sec. 1, Chap. VI, Title IV, Book IV.)</p>
<p>The trial  court further  held that "the private document of lease and right  of repurchase has no legal standing for more than six years from its execution, being to the prejudice of third persons, the heirs of one of the parties to it;" that "the plaintiff is entitled to the possession of the premises described in the complaint for six years from September 1, 1901, upon  paying the monthly sum of P150 and otherwise complying with the conditions of  the  private document executed between him and Pedro Sanchez, deceased, on September 1, 1901;" that "the plaintiff having complied with all  the terms  and conditions of the agreement of September 1, 1901," and that the six-year term set out therein having elapsed at the date of the entry of the judgment, the plaintiff was entitled, upon payment of the sum  of P15,000 to have executed to.him a resale of the premises described in the complaint, and  thereupon to have the consolidation entry in favor of Pedro Sanchez, deceased, annulled.</p>
<p>These rulings seem to be based upon article 1280 of the Civil Code, which provides that contracts of rental of real estate for a period of six or more years, when said contracts are to the  prejudice of third persons, must be executed in a public document.</p>
<p>But with  respect to the contract entered into by the deceased and evidenced by the document of September 1, 1901, the heirs can not be regarded  as "third  persons." Article 27  of the  Mortgage Law defines  a  "third person" to be "one who has not taken part  in the act or contract recorded."   Under the Civil Code, the heirs, by virtue of the right of succession are  subrogated to all the  rights and obligations of the deceased  (art.  661) and can not be regarded  as third  parties with  respect to a contract to which the deceased was a party, touching the  estate of the deceased.   (Barrios vh.  Dolor,  2 Phil. Kep., 44.) This  doctrine  was enunciated by the supreme court of Spain in its decision of January 27, 1881, wherein it held that  "both judicial and  extrajudicial acts, formally accepted by one who was a lawful party thereto, are effective as to the heirs and successors  of such persons, who are not to be regarded  as third persons  for this purpose;" also in its decision of January 28, 1892,  wherein it held  that "the heirs are no more than the continuation of the juridical personality of their predecessor  in interest, and can in no way be considered as third persons within the meaning of article 27 of the Mortgage Law."</p>
<p>The principle on which these decisions rest is not affected by the provisions of the new Code of Civil Procedure, and, in accordance with that principle, the heirs of a deceased person  can not be held  to be "third persons" in relation to any contracts touching the real estate of their decedent which comes  into their hands by right of  inner itance; they take such  property  subject to all the obligations resting thereon in the hands of him from whom they derive their rights.</p>
<p>Other than the above-cited provisions of article 1280 of the Civil Code, we know of no limitation to the  power of Pedro Sanchez, the owner  of the real  estate in question, to enter into the contract, of September 1, 1901.  Section 335 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which provides that an agreement for the leasing of real estate for a period longer than  one year, or for the sale of real property or of an interest therein,  must be in writing, was not in force at the time  when the contract was executed,  and,  in any event, that  contract,  while not  a  public document, was in fact made in writing.</p>
<p>As we construe the contract,  the plaintiff  upon complying with  its terms and conditions  is entitled to continue in possession  of  the land in question for a  period of ten years from the date thereof, and at the end of this period, upon payment of the sum of P15,000, to have the lands in question deeded to him by  the vendor or his proper legal representatives.</p>
<p>In  the  course of its opinion,  the  trial court held "that said Pedro Sanchez might  have been required to execute a public document containing the provisions of the private document during his lifetime, but his heirs or legal representatives can not be required to execute such a public document."  This proposition  seems to rest on  the theory that the heirs and legal representatives of the deceased are "third persons" with reference  to the said document.</p>
<p>But we have  said  that  with respect  to  the contract entered into by the deceased, and evidenced by the private document of September 1,  1901, the heirs can  not be regarded as "third  persons," and, .therefore, under the provisions of article 1279 of the  Civil Code,  the heirs of Pedro Sanchez may be  compelled  in a proper action to execute the public instrument evidencing  the said contract,  as required by the provisions of article 1280 of that code.</p>
<p>The heirs were  not made parties defendant in this action, which, so far as it seeks to  secure the execution of a public document under the provisions of article 1279 of  the Civil  Code, is not one which may be commenced against an executor  or administrator  under the provisions of sections  702 and 703 read together with section  114 of  the Code  of Civil Procedure, and  hence this  portion  Of  the prayer of the complaint can not be granted in this action.</p>
<p>The judgment of the trial court is reversed, without costs in  this  instance, and after ten days judgment will be entered against the plaintiff for the costs  in the Court of First Instance, but without prejudice to the right  of  the plaintiff to institute a proper action against the heirs to compel them to execute a public instrument evidencing  the terms  of the private document of September 1, 1901.   So ordered.</p>
