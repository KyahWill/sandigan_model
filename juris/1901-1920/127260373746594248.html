				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> A motion for rehearing has been made in this case.&nbsp; It is urged that our decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> overlooks the fact that the plaintiff children&nbsp; are&nbsp; citizens&nbsp; of this country and, hence, governed by the&nbsp; laws thereof.&nbsp; Without determining the political status of the plaintiffs, we have at some length endeavored to show&nbsp; that,&nbsp; clothing them with&nbsp; Philippine citizenship, the present law of guardianship, as contained in our Code of Civil Procedure, does not apply to them by reason of the saving provisions of section 581.&nbsp; The concurring opinion assumes their Spanish citizenship and, hence, their amenability to the laws of Spain.&nbsp; We might add that the admirable briefs&nbsp; of&nbsp; counsel for the defendant bank contain lengthy and&nbsp; strong arguments to the&nbsp; effect that these children are not citizens of&nbsp; the Philippine Islands, but citizens of Spain.&nbsp;&nbsp; If this be true, then it may be that this case ought to be decided in accordance with the&nbsp; provisions of the&nbsp; Spanish Civil&nbsp; Code, as&nbsp; stated in the&nbsp; concurring opinion.&nbsp; We purposely avoided a discussion of the political status&nbsp; of the plaintiffs, basing our decision entirely upon the existing laws of these Islands, as we understand them.<br><br>It is urged that the emancipation of the plaintiffs could not have been validly&nbsp; made for the reason that it was not recorded in a public document.&nbsp; This point was raised in the briefs and has been already answered in our decision.<br><br>It is&nbsp; next&nbsp; urged that the mortgage is invalid as to the plaintiffs because the mother's interest as a partner of the firm were directly opposed to the children's interests.&nbsp; Article 165 of the Civil Code is quoted in support of this contention.&nbsp; This article is clearly limited by its own words to children "not emancipated."&nbsp; Article 317 confers full capacity upon an&nbsp; emancipated child to control his person and property with the limitations stated.&nbsp; One of these is&nbsp; the encumbrance of his real property, which may not be done without the consent of the parent or, in his or her. absence, of the tutor.&nbsp; The resolutions of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Direccion General de los Registros </span>(Nov. 4, 1896; Jan. 7, 1907; and Jan. 30, 1911) distinctly hold that a formally emancipated child may participate in the division of an inheritance with the parent's consent, even when the latter is&nbsp; also interested. Certainly, the division of an undivided inheritance between the parent and the emancipated child is as&nbsp; strong a case of conflicting interests as is the case at bar.&nbsp; Manresa endeavors to apply article 165 to article 317 by analogy, and cites the resolution of November 19, 1898, in support of this&nbsp; contention.&nbsp; That case, however, was not one&nbsp; of formal emancipation, but of emancipation by marriage, and the land court expressly held that it was governed&nbsp; by articles 315&nbsp; and 59&nbsp; of the Civil Code and not by article 317.&nbsp; The case&nbsp; of&nbsp; November 14, 1896, one of formal emancipation and cited above, was expressly distinguished&nbsp; in&nbsp; the resolution&nbsp; of November 19, 1898, upon which Manresa relies.&nbsp; For that matter, article 165 is nowhere cited or discussed in&nbsp; the&nbsp; last mentioned resolution.&nbsp; We do not&nbsp; feel authorized&nbsp; to add to&nbsp; those limitations&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the capacity of a formally emancipated child in view of the decisions of the highest authorities on the point to which we have referred above.<br><br>It is urged, lastly,&nbsp; that the&nbsp; mortgage contract&nbsp; is&nbsp; void as to the plaintiffs by reason of a lack of consideration.&nbsp; It is asserted that they&nbsp; executed the mortgage under&nbsp; the impression&nbsp; that they were partners&nbsp; in the firm of Aldecoa &amp; Co.,&nbsp; when, as decided&nbsp; by a final judgment of the Court of First&nbsp; Instance,&nbsp; they&nbsp; were not&nbsp; such&nbsp; partners.&nbsp; Article 1276 of the Civil Code provides:<br><br><blockquote>&nbsp; "A statement of a false consideration&nbsp; in contracts shall render them void, unless&nbsp; it be proven that they were based on another real and licit&nbsp; one."</blockquote><br>By the same judgment which released the plaintiffs from their obligations as partners of the firm, they were declared creditors of that firm.&nbsp; Here was a valid&nbsp; and subsisting consideration for the mortgage; the creditors' desire to preserve the firm intact in the hope of recovering from it in due course their total credits.&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems&nbsp; clear that it was the object of the mother and the plaintiff children&nbsp; to thus save&nbsp; the business,&nbsp; and&nbsp; it matters little that the&nbsp; plaintiffs were creditors and not partners.<br><br>We see no reason for disturbing the decision heretofore rendered.&nbsp; Motion&nbsp; denied.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i> Arellano, C. J., Torres </i>and&nbsp; <i>Araullo, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 30 Phil.Rep., 228.<br></div>
