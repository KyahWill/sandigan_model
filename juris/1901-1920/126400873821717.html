				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Potenciano  Roxas took over a debt of  P1,612, which Mariano Tecson owed to Maria Esguerra, with a mortgage, for securing the payment thereof, on a steam  rice mill and the frame building in which it  was installed, with a bamboo fence and galvanized-iron  roof.  The debt was to be paid three months  after it had been assumed  by the new debtor, Potenciano Roxas, which was on June 4,  1907.</p>
<p>The Manila commercial firm of Hidalgo, Cuyugan &amp; Co. was the creditor of Potenciano Roxas and by entering suit in the Court of First Instance of Manila  obtained judgment for the payment of its  bill amounting to P724.98, with interest at 6 per cent per annum from January 10, 1908, and the costs.   This judgment was rendered on February 20 and execution ordered May  21, 1908.</p>
<p>Manuel E.  Cuyugan also secured judgments against Potenciano Roxas in the justice of the peace court of Manila in four suits, three for P500 and one for P340 with interest at 6 per cent per annum from January 9,  1908, and the costs. These judgments were  rendered January 17 and  execution ordered May  21, 1908.</p>
<p>On May 27, 1908, the sheriff of the Province of Bulacan levied upon  (<em>a</em>) a steam engine and rice mill, and (<em>b</em>) a house of  mixed materials  and an  iron-roofed warehouse beside it, and other equipment for cleaning rice.</p>
<p>The Manila firm of Castle Bros-Wolf &amp; Sons laid claim to all the  machinery specified under (<em>a</em>)  and the creditors Hidalgo, Cuyugan  &amp; Co., and Manuel E. Cuyugan admitted this claim.</p>
<p>On June 26, 1908, the said property was sold at public auction  by the sheriff of Bulacan and  adjudicated in  payment: The machinery under  (a)  to Castle Bros-Wolf &amp; Sons, and the house, warehouse and other equipment under (b) to the judgment creditors Hidalgo,  Cuyugan &amp; Co,, and Manuel  E. Cuyugan, for the  amounts of their respective judgments.</p>
<p>On June 27, 1908, the day after the auction, the sheriff issued to the respective  bidders, who had bought the property, the corresponding  bills  of sale.</p>
<p>The first time that Maria Esguerra  appears is on June 25, 1908, when she claims preference in payment over the bills  of  Hidalgo, Cuyugan &amp; Co., and Manuel E.  Cuyugan, no mention being made of Castle Bros-Wolf &amp; Sons, asking the sheriff to keep  in his possession the proceeds of the sale of said property and then to pay her bill of P1,612, with legal interest and costs, in preference to Hidalgo, Cuyugan &amp; Co., and Manuel  E.  Cuyugan.</p>
<p>The sheriff  was not notified or enjoined until June 29, 1908, when the sale had already been consummated and the corresponding bills of sale issued to the vendees.</p>
<p>The Court of First Instance of Bulacan rendered judgment absolving Mariano Tecson Roxas and the  sheriff of the Province of Bulacan from the complaint and sentencing Potenciano Roxas  to pay to  Maria Esguerra P1,612  with legal interest from the date of the filing  of the complaint and declaring the plaintiff's bill to have preference over the bills of the defendants  Hidalgo,  Cuyugan &amp; Co., and Manuel E. Cuyugan, against  the defendant Potenciano Roxas.</p>
<p>As not  only the  warehouse in question but also a house of mixed materials and other property, described under  the letter (b), was adjudicated to Messrs. Hidalgo, Cuyugan &amp; Co. and Manuel E. Cuyugan, only for the sum of Pl,564.98, less than the plaintiff's bill of P1,612, they were sentenced to turn over to the plaintiff enough from  the price of  the warehouse to satisfy the bill ordered paid to her, or otherwise the warehouse itself, with  the costs of the case, in equal parts, against Potenciano Roxas, Hidalgo, Cuyugan &amp; Co., and Manuel E. Cuyugan.   (B. of E.)</p>
<p>This judgment was appealed from by the plaintiff as well as by the  defendants Hidalgo, Cuyugan &amp; Co., and Manuel E.  Cuyugan, both parties filing  bills of exceptions.  The plaintiff asked that the defendants mentioned be compelled to deliver to her P1,612, which was in  their possession as part of the price of said property,  without the option of turning over to her the warehouse  dealt with in the judgment.  The defendants asked that the judgment be annulled in so far as it granted to the plaintiff preference in payment of her bill against the property already adjudicated through public auction, or against the price secured at the auction or a portion thereof.</p>
<p>In deciding both appeals, it  is necessary  to observe:</p>
<p>First, When on June 29,1908, the sheriff was notified and enjoined to retain  in his possession  the price he might secure from the auction, it was then impossible to do so, for it had been collected and paid to the  judgment creditors on  the 27th  preceding.  Accordingly, the  complaint was wholly inoperative and the court could not definitely order  the sheriff to hold in his possession what had already in a just and legal manner, by payment of an execution, passed into the hands of the judgment creditors.</p>
<p>Second.  After the proceeds  of the execution are in their possession  by virtue of final judgment,  execution, auction, and payment, there is no valid reason why they  should  not keep what they have justly collected or be obliged to return what they have received in payment of their bill.</p>
<p>Third. Still less  can they be obliged to turn over to any one the piece of real property  which they bought at a legal and valid  public auction, after they have received the bill of sale, through which they have acquired all the  right, interest, title, and  rights  of  action  which  the judgment debtor had over the same (Code of Civil Procedure,  sec. 463),  and  which have not been overthrown  in any suit for nullifying  or rescinding the sale at public auction by which they acquired them.</p>
<p>Fourth.  Even admitting that the plaintiff's bill should really  have preference over that  of the defendants,  such preference can not afford  legal ground for annulling judgments and executions  already  terminated,  as  though  the petition of a less preferred creditor in his own right signified nothing in the eyes of the law,  when it is  a  well-known maxim that vigilanti prospiciunt jura; that is, that the  law protects him who is watchful of his rights.</p>
<p>Fifth. It is wholly improper, in such a state of affairs and accomplished  facts,  to  permit discussion of  the preference of claims, which would  have been in order before judgment and payment.</p>
<p>Therefore, the findings  of the judgment  appealed from by the defendants,  which  declare the plaintiff's claim to have preference in payment and which order them to turn over to the plaintiff either  enough of the  price of the warehouse  to pay the bill adjudicated to her, or  the warehouse itself,  are  hereby reversed, without  special  findings as to costs in this second instance.</p>
