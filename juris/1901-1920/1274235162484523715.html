				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an action brought&nbsp; to recover of the defendants the value of certain articles taken from a Roman Catholic Church,&nbsp; located in the&nbsp; municipality of Placer,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the rental value of the church and its appurtenances, including the church&nbsp; cemetery,&nbsp; from&nbsp; the&nbsp; 11th day&nbsp; of December, 1901, until the month&nbsp; of April, 1904.&nbsp; After hearing&nbsp; the evidence, the court below gave judgment in favor&nbsp; of&nbsp; the plaintiff for the sum of Pl,581, with interest at 6 per cent from the date of the judgment.&nbsp; The said sum of P1,581 was made up of two&nbsp; items, one of which, P741, was&nbsp; for the value of the articles taken from the church, and&nbsp; the other, P840, the rental value of&nbsp; the&nbsp; premises during&nbsp; the occupation by defendants.&nbsp; From this&nbsp; judgment the&nbsp; defendants appealed&nbsp; to this court.<br><br>It appears that the defendants&nbsp; were on the 11th&nbsp; day of December, 1901, members of&nbsp; the&nbsp; municipal&nbsp; board&nbsp; of&nbsp; the municipality of Placer,&nbsp; and that they on that date addressed to the plaintiff&nbsp; in&nbsp; this&nbsp; case, who was the priest in&nbsp; charge of the church, its appurtenances and contents, the following letter:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: right;">"PLACER,&nbsp; <i>11th December, 1901.</i><br></div><br>"R. P. ELADIO ALONSO, <i>Benedictino</i>,&nbsp; Surigao.<br><br>"ESTEEMED PADRE : After saluting you, we take the&nbsp; liberty of writing you&nbsp; to&nbsp; inform you that in the municipality of which we have charge we have received an order from&nbsp; the provincial fiscal, dated the 5th instant, which says: 'The cemeteries, convents, and other buildings erected on land belonging to the town at the expense of the town and preserved by it belong to the town,&nbsp; and for this&nbsp; reason the municipality is under the obligation of&nbsp; administering them and of collecting the revenues therefrom, and for this reason we notify you that from this date all of the revenues and products therefrom must be&nbsp; turned into the&nbsp; treasury of the municipality in&nbsp; order that the&nbsp; people may&nbsp; properly preserve them.'<br><br>"In the same way we&nbsp; notify you that the image of&nbsp; St. Vicente which&nbsp; is now in the church, as it is&nbsp; an image donated to the people by its owner, by virtue of said order is also the property of said&nbsp; people, and therefore the&nbsp; alms which&nbsp; are given&nbsp; it by the&nbsp; devotees&nbsp; thereof&nbsp; must be also turned into&nbsp; the municipal treasury&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; proper preservation&nbsp; of the church and for&nbsp; other necessary purposes. We hope&nbsp; that you will&nbsp; view this in&nbsp; the proper light and that you will deliver to&nbsp; the bearer of this&nbsp; letter the key of the alms&nbsp; box of the&nbsp; said image&nbsp; in order&nbsp; that&nbsp; we may comply with&nbsp; our obligation in&nbsp; conformity&nbsp; with&nbsp; the dispositions&nbsp; of said order.<br><br>"We beg to remain as always your spiritual sons.&nbsp; Q.

The question there litigated&nbsp; was the claim upon the part of the municipality&nbsp; of&nbsp; ownership of said church and&nbsp; its appurtenances&nbsp; on the ground&nbsp; that&nbsp; according&nbsp; to Spanish law the Roman&nbsp; Catholic Apostolic Church was not the owner of such property, having only&nbsp; the use&nbsp; thereof for ordinary ecclesiastical and religious purposes, and that the true owner thereof was the&nbsp; municipality or the State by reason of the contributions by&nbsp; them, or by the people, of the land and of the&nbsp; funds with which the buildings were constructed or repaired.&nbsp; The&nbsp; court decided in that case that the claim of the&nbsp; defendants was not well founded and that the property belonged to the Roman Catholic Church. The same question was discussed and&nbsp; decided&nbsp; in the case of Barlin&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Ramirez (7 Phil.&nbsp; Rep., 41), and&nbsp; the case of The Municipality of&nbsp; Ponce vs. Roman Catholic Apostolic Church in Porto Rico (28 Sup. Ct.&nbsp; Rep., 737,&nbsp; 6 Off. Gaz., 1213).<br><br>We have made a careful examination of the&nbsp; record and the evidence in this&nbsp; case and we have no doubt that the property sued for was, at&nbsp; the&nbsp; time it was taken by the defendants,&nbsp; the property of the Roman Catholic Church, and&nbsp; that the seizure&nbsp; of the&nbsp; same and occupation of&nbsp; the church&nbsp; and&nbsp; its appurtenances&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants&nbsp; were wrongful and illegal&nbsp; We are&nbsp; also convinced,&nbsp; from&nbsp; such examination, that the conclusions of the court below&nbsp; as to the value&nbsp; of the articles&nbsp; taken by the defendants and of the rent of the church for&nbsp; the&nbsp; time of its illegal occupation by the defendants were correct and proper.&nbsp; While some objection was&nbsp; made on appeal by&nbsp; counsel for&nbsp; the defendants&nbsp; that&nbsp; the value&nbsp; of the articles&nbsp; taken&nbsp; and of the rent of the church and its appurtenances had not been proved&nbsp; by competent&nbsp; evidence,&nbsp; no objection to the introduction of the evidence&nbsp; of value was made at the trial and&nbsp; we can not consider&nbsp; that question raised for the first time here.<br><br>We have&nbsp; carefully examined the assignments of error made by&nbsp; counsel for the defendants on this appeal.&nbsp; We find&nbsp; none of them well founded.&nbsp; The only one which deserves especial attention&nbsp; at our hands is the one wherein the defendants assert that&nbsp; the&nbsp; court&nbsp; below erred&nbsp; in permitting the action to be brought and continued in the name of the plaintiff&nbsp; instead of&nbsp; in the name of the bishop of the diocese&nbsp; within&nbsp; which the&nbsp; church was located, or in the name of&nbsp; the Roman Catholic Apostolic&nbsp; Church, as the real&nbsp; party in interest.<br><br>It is&nbsp; undoubted that the bishop of the&nbsp; diocese or the Roman&nbsp; Catholic Apostolic Church itself is the&nbsp; real party in interest.&nbsp;&nbsp; The plaintiff&nbsp; personally has&nbsp; no&nbsp; interest in the cause of action.&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 114 of the&nbsp; Code&nbsp; of Civil Procedure requires that every action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest.&nbsp; The plaintiff is not such party.<br><br>Section 110 of the&nbsp; Code of&nbsp; Civil Procedure, however, provides:<br><blockquote>"Sec. 110. <i>Amendments&nbsp; in&nbsp; general</i>. - The court shall, in furtherance of justice, and on such terms,&nbsp; if&nbsp; any, as may be proper,&nbsp; allow a party to amend any pleading or proceeding and at any stage of the&nbsp; action, in&nbsp; either the Court of First Instance or the Supreme Court,&nbsp; by adding or striking out the name of any party,&nbsp; either plaintiff or defendant, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistaken or inadequate allegation or description in any&nbsp; other respect,&nbsp; so that the actual&nbsp; merits of the controversy&nbsp; may speedily be&nbsp; determined,&nbsp; without regard to technicalities, and in the&nbsp; most expeditious and inexpensive&nbsp; manner.&nbsp; The court&nbsp; may also, upon like terms, allow an&nbsp; answer or&nbsp; other&nbsp; pleading to be&nbsp; made&nbsp; after the time limited by the rules of the court for filing the same.&nbsp; Orders of the court upon the matters provided in this section shall be&nbsp; made upon&nbsp; motion filed&nbsp; in court, and&nbsp; after notice&nbsp; to the adverse party,&nbsp; and an opportunity to be heard."</blockquote>Section 503&nbsp; of the same code provides:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 503. <i>Judgment&nbsp; not to be reversed&nbsp; on technical grounds.</i> - No judgment shall be reversed on formal or technical&nbsp; grounds,&nbsp; or&nbsp; for such error&nbsp; as has&nbsp; not&nbsp; prejudiced the real rights of&nbsp; the excepting party."<br></blockquote>We&nbsp; are confident under these provisions&nbsp; that this court has full power, apart&nbsp; from that power and authority which is inherent, to&nbsp; amend the process,&nbsp; pleadings, proceedings, and decision in this case by substituting, as party plaintiff, the real party in interest.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only&nbsp; are we confident that we&nbsp; may do so,&nbsp; but&nbsp; we are convinced&nbsp; that we should do so. Such&nbsp; an amendment&nbsp; does not constitute, really, a change in the identity&nbsp; of the parties.&nbsp; The plaintiff asserts in&nbsp; his complaint,&nbsp; and maintains that assertion all&nbsp; through the record, that he is engaged in the prosecution of this case, not for himself, but for the bishop of the diocese - not by his own right,&nbsp; but&nbsp; by right of another.&nbsp;&nbsp; He seeks merely to do for the bishop what the bishop&nbsp; might do for himself. His own personality&nbsp; is not involved.&nbsp;&nbsp; His&nbsp; own rights are not presented.&nbsp; He claims no interest whatever in the litigation.&nbsp;&nbsp; He seeks only the welfare of the great church whose servant he is.&nbsp;&nbsp; He&nbsp; gladly permits his identity to be wholly swallowed&nbsp; up in that of his superior.&nbsp; The&nbsp; substitution, then,&nbsp; of the name of the&nbsp; bishop&nbsp; of the diocese,&nbsp; or the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church, for that of Padre Alonso, as party plaintiff, is not in reality&nbsp; the substitution of one identity for&nbsp; another, of one&nbsp; party&nbsp; for another,&nbsp; but&nbsp; is simply to make the form express the&nbsp; substance.&nbsp; The substance is there.&nbsp; It appears all through the&nbsp; proceedings. No&nbsp; one is&nbsp; deceived for&nbsp; an instant as to whose interests are at stake.&nbsp; The form of its expression is alone defective. The substitution,&nbsp; then,&nbsp; is&nbsp; not&nbsp; substantial&nbsp; but&nbsp; formal. Defect in mere form can not possibly prejudice so long as the substantial is clearly evident.&nbsp; Form&nbsp; is a method of speech used to express substance and make&nbsp; it clearly appear.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; the means&nbsp; by which the&nbsp; substance&nbsp; reveals itself.&nbsp; If the form&nbsp; be faulty and still&nbsp; the&nbsp; substance&nbsp; shows plainly through, no harm can come by making the form accurately expressive of the substance.<br><br>No one has been&nbsp; misled&nbsp; by the error in the name&nbsp; of the party plaintiff.&nbsp;&nbsp; If we should by reason of this error send this&nbsp; case back for amendment&nbsp; and new trial, there would be on the retrial the same complaint, the same answer, the same defense, the same interests, the same witnesses, and the same&nbsp; evidence.&nbsp; The name of the plaintiff would constitute the only difference between the old trial and the new. In our judgment there is not&nbsp; enough in&nbsp; a name to justify such action.<br><br>There is nothing sacred about processes or pleadings, their forms or contents.&nbsp; Their sole purpose is to facilitate the application of justice to the rival claims of contending parties. They were created, not to hinder and delay, but to facilitate and promote, the administration of justice.&nbsp;&nbsp; They do not constitute the thing itself, which courts are always striving to&nbsp; secure&nbsp; to litigants.&nbsp; They are designed as the&nbsp; means best&nbsp; adapted to obtain&nbsp; that thing.&nbsp; In other words, they are a means to an end. (When they&nbsp; lose the character&nbsp; of the one and become the other,&nbsp; the administration of justice is at fault and courts are correspondingly remiss&nbsp; in the performance of their obvious&nbsp; duty.<br><br>The&nbsp; error in this case is purely technical.&nbsp; To take advantage of it for other purposes than to cure it, does not appeal to a fair sense of justice.&nbsp; Its presentation as fatal to the plaintiff's case smacks of skill rather than right.&nbsp;&nbsp; A litigation is not a game of technicalities in which one, more deeply schooled and skilled in the subtle art of movement and position, entraps and destroys the other.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is,&nbsp; rather, a contest in which each contending party fully and fairly lays before the court the facts in issue and then, brushing aside as wholly trivial and indecisive all imperfections of form and technicalities of procedure, asks that justice be done upon the merits.&nbsp; Lawsuits, unlike duels, are not to be won by a rapier's thrust.&nbsp; Technicality, when it deserts its proper office as an.aid to justice and becomes its great hindrance&nbsp; and chief&nbsp; enemy, deserves scant consideration from courts.&nbsp; There should be no vested rights in technicalities.&nbsp; No litigant should be permitted to challenge a record of a court of these Islands&nbsp; for&nbsp; defect of form when his substantial&nbsp; rights have not&nbsp; been prejudiced thereby.<br><br>In ordering this substitution, we are in accord with the best judicial thought,&nbsp;&nbsp; (McKeighan <i>vs.</i> Hopkins, 19 Neb., 83;&nbsp; Dixon <i>vs</i>.
