				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This was an application for the writ of habeas corpus, presented in the Court 
of First Instance of the city of Manila, to require the Insular Collector of 
Customs to show by what authority he was detaining the bodies of the 
petitioners.
<p>It appears from the record that said petition was presented in the Court of 
First Instance of the city of Manila, on the 11th day of February, 1914. We find 
also, upon an examination of the record, that almost exactly the same petition, 
word for word, even including the interlineations and misspelling, had 
theretofore been presented in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, 
on the 24th day of September, 1912. The record shows that upon the presentation 
of the first cause in the Court of First Instance (No. 9949), an order was 
issued to the Insular Collector of Customs to show why the1 prayer of said 
petitioners should not be granted. To that order, the Acting Insular Collector 
of Customs made answer, setting forth a correct copy of all the proceedings 
relating to said petition, which had been had in the department of customs.</p>
<p>Upon the record thus made and the issues presented therein, the Honorable A. 
S. Crossfield, judge, found that the Insular Collector of Customs was legally 
detaining the bodies of the said petitioners, and denied the writ of habeas 
corpus. From that judgment, the petitioners appealed to this court.<br><br>The 
record in that cause was received in the office of the clerk of the Supreme 
Court on the 30th day of January, 1913. Said cause was not given a number in the 
Supreme Court, for the reason that the appellants never paid the registration 
fee. On the 31st day of January, Idl3, the attorneys for the appellants were 
notified and requested to pay the filing fee necessary for the registration of 
said cause. The appellants apparently paid no attention whatever to said notice. 
On the 29th day of October, 1913, the Supreme Court dictated an order, directed 
to the attorneys for the plaintiffs and appellants, requiring them, within a 
period of ten days after notice, to pay to the clerk the sum of P24, as the 
registration fee. Said order further provided that in case they should fail to 
pay such registration fee, the court would consider that they had abandoned 
their appeal and that the same would be dismissed and the case returned to the 
lower court for execution. A copy of said order was actually received by the 
attorneys* for the appellants, as more fully appears by the certificate of the 
sheriff of the city of Manila, on the 11th day of November, 1913. So far as the 
record shows, the appellants paid no attention to the foregoing order of the 
court.</p>
<p>The appellants having failed to comply with the foregoing order, the Supreme 
Court, on the 15th day of December, 1913, dictated a further order, dismissing 
said appeal. In accordance with said order a final judgment was rendered in said 
cause and the record returned to the Court of First Instance upon the 17th day 
of December, 1913.</p>
<p>Nearly two months after final judgment had been rendered in said cause (No. 
9949) and after the same had been returned to the lower court for execution, the 
plaintiffs, on the 11th day of February, 1914, presented the petition in the 
present cause, which, as was said above, is exactly the same, word for word, 
even to the interlineations and misspelling, as that presented in cause No. 
9949.</p>
<p>On the 13th day of February, 1914, Mr. Beaumont appearing for the petitioners 
and Mr. Gerkin for the respondent, they entered into the following 
agreement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"1. That the question raised in the present case has already been submitted 
to the Third Branch by the same interested parties, in case No. 9949, and 
decided by Judge Crossfield adversely to the claims of the appellant.</p>
<p>"2. That when the judgment was appealed from to the Supreme Court of these 
Islands, the appeal was vacated in said court through failure to pay the legal 
fees.</p>
<p>"3. That the interested party, through his counsel, again raises in this 
court the same question that was decided in the First Branch, so that he may 
have the opportunity to appeal from whatever judgment is rendered.</p>
<p>"4. That by common agreement they submit the same proceedings had in the 
Third Branch as evidence in the present case.</p>
<p>"5. That counsel for the Collector of Customs submits the same reply that is 
already on record in case No. 9949, so that it be considered in the present case 
as the answer therein."</p></blockquote>
<p>On the issues thus presented by the petition, the said agreement and the 
record made in said cause No. 9949, the case was submitted to the Honorable 
Simplicio del Rosario, judge, who, after setting forth the said agreement, 
rendered a decision, the dispositive part of which is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The petition now presented by the same interested party having been decided 
against him by the judge presiding in the Third Branch and the facts submitted 
by the petitioner not having changed.</p>
<p>"The writ of habeas corpus sought is denied, with the costs against the 
petitioner."</p></blockquote>
<p>From that judgment the petitioners appealed to this court and made a number 
of assignments of error, all relating to the authority and conduct of the 
customs authorities in passing upon the right of the petitioners to enter the 
Philippine Islands.</p>
<p>It is difficult to understand upon what theory the attorneys for the 
petitioners, after a final judgment had been rendered against their clients, can 
justify the presentation of the same questions again in a new action, without 
even alleging or indicating the existence of new questions or facts which had 
arisen subsequently. A final judgment in a habeas corpus proceeding is just as 
binding upon the parties as a final judgment in any other proceeding. The 
parties have no more right to relitigate the same questions inv habeas corpus 
proceeding than they have in an ordinary action. A final judgment in such 
actions concludes further proceedings just as effectually as it does in other 
proceedings.</p>
<p>A judgment which has been rendered in proceedings regularly conducted, when 
the same is not tainted with fraud, can not be disregarded or set aside, except 
and until, in some legal proceeding brought for that purpose, it has been 
nullified. In the present case no intimation is made in the record or no 
suggestion presented that the final judgment was illegal for any reason. No hint 
is made even that it should be set aside or annulled. Its existence and finality 
are admitted by the petitioners. Their only reason for commencing the present 
action is that they may have another judgment upon the same facts, with the 
evident hope that the next may be different and more favorable to them.</p>
<p>The questions presented in the present petition have been once settled by the 
courts. That judgment is final. No new facts have been presented. No new 
questions have arisen. No reason is alleged nor suggested why the court should 
reopen the case already closed, and closed by the consent of the parties.</p>
<p>For the reason that all the facts presented in the present action have 
already been passed upon by the courts in a decision which has become final, it 
is hereby ordered that the appeal in the present case be dismissed, with costs 
against the appellants, and without a further discussion of the assignments of 
error, it is so ordered.</p>
