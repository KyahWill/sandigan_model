				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Appeals&nbsp; were interposed by&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants Bernardo Gregorio and Eustaquio Balistoy from the judgment rendered in the two causes prosecuted, No. 1574, against Bernardo Gregorio, and No. 1575, against Eustaquio Balistoy, which were consolidated and in which but one judgment was&nbsp; rendered, and forwarded to this court and registered under No. 5791.<br><br>In the suit instituted by Pedro Salazar,&nbsp; as a creditor, against&nbsp; Eustaquio Balistoy, in the justice of the peace court of Libog, for the payment of a&nbsp; certain sum of&nbsp; money, judgment was&nbsp; rendered,&nbsp; on April&nbsp; 4, 1908, wherein the debtor was sentenced to pay to the plaintiff P275.92,&nbsp; with interest thereon, and the costs.&nbsp; For the&nbsp; execution of the said&nbsp; judgment,&nbsp; two rural properties belonging to the debtor were attached and the 27th of May, 1908, was set as the date for the sale&nbsp; and&nbsp; adjudication&nbsp; of the&nbsp; said attached properties to the highest bidder.&nbsp; On the&nbsp; 18th of the&nbsp; same month,&nbsp; Bernardo Gregorio requested the&nbsp; deputy sheriff to exclude&nbsp; the said realty&nbsp; from the attachment, alleging that he was,&nbsp; the owner of the land&nbsp; situated in Tambogon, one of the properties levied upon, 400 <i>brazas</i> in circumference, situate in the pueblo of Bacacay, the location and boundaries of which are expressed in his&nbsp; petition, for the&nbsp; reason that he had&nbsp; acquired it by purchase from the&nbsp; judgment debtor, Balistoy, in 1905, prior to the filing&nbsp; of the complaint.&nbsp; By reason&nbsp; of&nbsp; this claim and petition the judgment creditor, Salazar, had to give a&nbsp; bond, in view of which the sheriff proceeded with the sale of the said property, and of another, also attached for the&nbsp; sum of P300, and both&nbsp; were adjudicated to the judgment&nbsp; creditor, according to the certificate, Exhibit C.<br><br>In order that the&nbsp; claim of intervention presented to the sheriff&nbsp; might prosper, Bernardo Gregorio attached thereto the&nbsp; document Exhibit D, at the end of which and among other particulars appears the memorandum dated in Libog as of February 22, 1905, and signed&nbsp; by Eustaquio Balistoy, Lorenzo Gregorio, and&nbsp; Cirilo Valla,&nbsp; and in which Balistoy states&nbsp; that&nbsp; he bought&nbsp; the&nbsp; land referred to in the said document from Luis Balistoy and sold it to Bernardo Gregorio for P300, wherefore he signed as such vendor. <br></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">The&nbsp; charge&nbsp; consists in that Balistoy,&nbsp; with intent to injure&nbsp; his creditor, Pedro Salazar, and for the purpose of avoiding the attachment and sale of one of the properties belonging to him,&nbsp; to secure the payment&nbsp; of the judgment obtained by his creditor in the aforementioned suit,&nbsp; did, with disregard of&nbsp; the truth in the narration of the facts, execute or write the said memorandum whereby,&nbsp; on February&nbsp; 25, 1905, he made&nbsp; or simulated a conveyance of one of the attached properties in favor of the said Bernardo Gregorio, according to the aforesaid copy,&nbsp; when in fact the said memorandum was written in April, 1908.<br><br>For&nbsp; the foregoing reasons a complaint was filed in each of the&nbsp; two aforesaid causes&nbsp; in the Court of First Instance of Albay,&nbsp; charging each of the defendants with the crime of the&nbsp; falsification of a private document, and proceedings having been instituted&nbsp; in both causes, which were&nbsp; afterwards, by agreement of the parties thereto, consolidated, the court, on November 6, 1909, pronounced in both of them the judgment appealed from, written in duplicate, whereby Balistoy was sentenced to the penalty of one year eight months and&nbsp; twenty-one days of <i>presidio correccional</i>, to the accessory&nbsp; penalties,&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay a fine&nbsp; of&nbsp; 1,501 pesetas, and, in case of nonpayment thereof through insolvency, to suffer the&nbsp; corresponding subsidiary&nbsp; imprisonment; provided&nbsp; it should&nbsp; not exceed&nbsp; one-third of the principal sentence,&nbsp; and to pay&nbsp; the costs incurred in cause No. 1575; and likewise, Bernardo&nbsp; Gregorio was sentenced to the&nbsp; penalty of three months and&nbsp; eleven days of <i>arresto mayor,</i>&nbsp; to pay a fine of 1,980 pesetas, and, in case of insolvency, to the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment, with the provision that it should not exceed&nbsp; one-third of the principal penalty, to the accessory punishments, and to pay the&nbsp; costs&nbsp; occasioned by cause&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 1574.&nbsp;&nbsp; From these sentences&nbsp;&nbsp; the defendants, respectively, appealed.<br><br>This&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; case concerns the falsity of a document alleged to have been written on a date prior to the one when it actually was prepared,&nbsp; which instrument&nbsp; simulates the sale&nbsp; of&nbsp; a parcel of land by its owner to a third party, with the intent to defraud the creditor who, through proper judicial process, solicited and obtained the attachment and sale of the said property in order, with the proceeds of such sale, to recover the amount which the owner of the land owed him.<br><br>The sale was recorded in a memorandum,&nbsp; made&nbsp; upon&nbsp; a private document, according to the&nbsp; alleged copy of the latter presented at trial which belonged to the owner of the land; and, notwithstanding the fact that the sheriff, who carried out the proceedings of attachment&nbsp; and sale,&nbsp; testified to his having seen the original of the said&nbsp; document, or at least the original memorandum of the conveyance, the only record that could be of use to the intervener, who claimed a lien on the&nbsp; land which&nbsp; was&nbsp; to be sold at public auction; certainly the 'mere&nbsp; exhibition of&nbsp; a copy of an unauthenticated private document could not legally produce the effect of suspending the sale of the said land, inasmuch as&nbsp; such copy is not&nbsp; sufficient proof of the right of the intervener and opponent, being a&nbsp; mere copy of a private document whose legality has not been proven.<br><br>In the charge filed in this&nbsp; cause against the&nbsp; vendor and the vendee of the land&nbsp; in question, it is stated that these parties, the defendants, simulated the&nbsp; said memorandum of sale or conveyance of the land with the intent to injure the creditor, Pedro&nbsp; Salazar; but as the original document, setting&nbsp; forth the said&nbsp; memorandum,&nbsp; was not presented, but merely&nbsp; a copy&nbsp; thereof,&nbsp; and furthermore,&nbsp; as it could not be ascertained who had&nbsp; the original of the document containing the memorandum in&nbsp; question, nor the exact date when the&nbsp; latter was written; the said memorandum, presumed to be simulated and false,&nbsp; was not&nbsp; literally&nbsp; compared by the sheriff who testified&nbsp; that he&nbsp; had seen its original for but a few moments, nor by any officer authorized by law to&nbsp; certify to documents and proceedings&nbsp; such as are recorded in notarial&nbsp; instruments, nor even&nbsp; by two witnesses who might afterwards have been able to testify before the court that the copy exhibited was in exact agreement&nbsp; with&nbsp; its original; therefore, on account of these deficiencies, doubt arises as to whether the original of the document,&nbsp; Exhibit&nbsp; D,&nbsp; really existed at all, and whether the memorandum&nbsp; at the foot&nbsp; of the said exhibit is&nbsp; an exact&nbsp; copy of that alleged to have been written at the end of the said&nbsp; original document.<br><br>In criminal proceedings for the falsification of a document, it&nbsp; is indispensable that the judges&nbsp; and courts have before them the document alleged to have been simulated, counterfeited, or falsified,&nbsp; in order&nbsp; that&nbsp; they may find, pursuant to the evidence produced in the cause, whether or not the&nbsp; crime of&nbsp; falsification was committed, and also, at the same time, to enable&nbsp; them to determine the degree of each defendant's liability&nbsp; in the falsification&nbsp; under prosecution.&nbsp; Through the lack&nbsp; of the original document containing the memorandum alleged to be false, it&nbsp; is improper to hold, with only a copy of the&nbsp; said original in view, that the crime prosecuted was committed; and although, judging from&nbsp; the testimony&nbsp; of the witnesses who were examined in the two&nbsp; consolidated causes, there is reason to entertain much&nbsp; doubt as to the defendants'&nbsp; innocence, yet,&nbsp; withal, this case does&nbsp; not&nbsp; furnish&nbsp; decisive and&nbsp; conclusive proof of their respective guilt as co-principals of the crime charged. Defendants in a criminal cause are always presumed&nbsp; to be innocent&nbsp; until their guilt be fully proven, and, in&nbsp; case of reasonable&nbsp; doubt and when their guilt is not satisfactorily shown, they&nbsp; are entitled to a judgment of acquittal.&nbsp; In view&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; evidence produced&nbsp; in berth of the aforesaid criminal causes, said causes can only be terminated by such a finding.<br><br>For the foregoing reasons, it&nbsp; is proper, in our opinion, with a reversal of the judgment appealed from, to acquit, and we hereby do acquit Eustaquio Balistoy and Bernardo Gregorio, with the costs of both&nbsp; instances&nbsp; <i>de oftcio.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J., Mapa, Johnson, Carson,</i> and <i>Moreland, JJ</i>., concur.<br></div>
