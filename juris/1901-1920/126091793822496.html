				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>It appears from the bill of exceptions that the trial of this case was  commenced before  the  court  in the usual way; that the parties to the suit were Chinamen, and all the written evidence was in their language; that there was some difficulty regarding the translation of this  evidence, and also in  regard to the interpreting of other evidence which the parties presented  in court.  For this  reason, after the plaintiff had practically completed  the  presentation of his evidence, the  parties  entered into an  agreement that the case might be referred to a  referee in  accordance with the provisions of section 135 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and an order was made to  that effect. The referee, a Chinaman,  made his report on the 17th of December, 1903.  No objection or exception of any kind was made  to this report, and on the 14th day of  January, 1904, the court entered judgment  in accordance with the report, in  favor of the plaintiff, for the amount reported by the referee.   The  defendant took an exception to the judgment of the court, and also made a motion for a new trial, which was denied,  to which denial he excepted.</p>
<p>For the purposes  of  this  appeal we will assume, as claimed by the appellant, that his motion for a new trial was based upon section  497, paragraph  3 of the Code of Civil Procedure,  and that we  consequently have a right to consider all of the evidence  which he has caused to be brought here.</p>
<p>The first assignment of error relates to the legal capacity of the plaintiff to sue.  It appears from the evidence taken before the judge that the plaintiff and three other persons formed a partnership in China to do business in the Philippine Islands.  One of them, Yap-Jongco, was in charge of the store which the partnership maintained in Iloilo, until his death in April, 1901.  Upon his death the plaintiff, by agreement with the remaining partners, took possession of and managed the business at Iloilo.  He brought this action to recover of the defendant the value  of goods sold to the latter by the  partnership during the lifetime of Yap-Jongco.</p>
<p>The defendant  in  his answer, by &amp; failure to deny, admitted that:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"4. El primero de Abril de 1901 falleci6 en esta ciudad el citado Yap-Jongco, por cuyo motivo qued6 sin gerente el negocio d"e  Yap-Jongco y Compafiia, por lo que se vio obligado el demandante como socio capitalista a  ponerse al frente de los negocios, que antes regentara Yap-Jongco, de cuyo activo y pasivo se hizo cargo desde luego."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He alleged, however, that the plaintiff was without legal capacity to maintain this action.</p>
<p>It is not necessary  to  decide whether  the  partnership formed in China  could have maintained an action in its own name in  these Islands.  It has not attempted to do so,  and was,  moreover, dissolved  in 1901  by the death of Yap-Jongco.   Upon  his death the remaining partners became the only owners of the assets of the late partnership, including this debt due from the defendant.   Even  if it be  admitted  that the  partnership never  was a juridical person in the Philippines, and that the agreement made by  the  surviving partners authorizing the plaintiff to take charge of the business did not authorize him  to maintain this suit without joining with him as plaintiffs his associates, the fact  yet remains  that the only objection available to the  defendant was the objection that under section 114 of the Code of Civil Procedure the other two partners should have been joined as plaintiffs.  The failure to so join them constituted not a want of capacity to sue, but a defect of  parties plaintiff.  This defect appeared upon the face of the complaint.   It is by  the Code made a ground for demurrer (sec. 91, par. 4). This ground for demurrer is distinct from  that founded upon a want of legal capacity to sue,  which  is the second  ground mentioned in said section  91.  The defendant alleged in his answer that the  plaintiff  had not legal capacity to sue, but this defect of parties  caused by  the  failure to join as  plaintiffs the  other surviving partners, the defendant did not present either by demurrer or answer.   He therefore waived it  (Sec. 93, Code of Civil Procedure.)</p>
<p>The second assignment of error relates to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the judgment.   In a case tried by  the inferior court unless the evidence before this court shows that his findings are wrong, they must be sustained. The same rule should  apply  to the findings made by a referee appointed in  accordance  with said section  135, when they are approved by the court and judgment entered thereon.   Section 140 provides  that the court shall  render judgment "as though the facts had been  found by the judge  himself."</p>
<p>At the instance of  the  appellant all the evidence introduced before the judge and the documentary evidence introduced before the  referee  has  been sent  to this court for its consideration.  If other evidence than that remitted was introduced before the referee it was the duty of  the appellant to present it here.</p>
<p>The fact that the report of  the referee does not contain all  the facts necessary to  support the judgment can not avail the appellant, inasmuch as he made a  motion for a new trial based  upon section 497, paragraph 3, and in such a case it is  our duty, by the terms of  said section, to examine  the proofs which  the appellant presents, and render such judgment as justice and equity  may require. (Benedicto <em>vs</em>. De la Kama,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 2 Off. Gaz., 166, Lorenzo <em>vs</em>. Navarro, No. 2021.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>)   In this case the facts which do not appear in the report do appear in the evidence.   An examination of the record presented by the  appellant does not show that the findings of the referee as to the amounts due by the defendant are not correct.</p>
<p>As to the counterclaim presented by the appellant in his answer,  the  evidence  brought here by him does not show that he introduced any proof relating thereto, either before the judge or the referee.   It  was his duty to present such evidence if he did not wish to have his counterclaim considered as abandoned.</p>
<p>The judgment of the court below is affirmed,  with the costs of this instance against the appellant, and  after the expiration of twenty  days judgment shall be rendered in accordance herewith and the  case  remanded to the court below for execution.   So ordered.</p>
