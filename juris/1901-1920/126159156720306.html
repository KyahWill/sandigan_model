				G.R. No. 2609, July 28, 1906</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE, VS. ANTONIO JAVIER, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The defendant was the treasurer of the municipality of Imus from February, 1904,  to the 3d of November of  the same year.  On  the latter date an examination  of  his accounts  was made from which it appeared that he then should have had in his hands as such treasurer  the sum of P3,181.71.   The amount  of cash which he in fact then had, the  money  which  he  turned over  to  his successor, was P484.24, leaving a deficit of P2,697.47.</p>
<p>In. the case of  The United States <em>vs</em>. Ramon Melencio<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> (3 Off. Gaz., 300) this court said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"According to a decision of the supreme court of Spain of November 21, 1888, the facts that a municipal treasurer has  received into his  custody money of  the municipality, that he has not paid  it over,  that he does not have it in his possession,  and that he  furnishes no reasonable explanation  for its disappearance  are sufficient to convict him  of embezzlement as provided for in  article 407 of the Penal  Code  (392  of  the Penal  Code of  the Philippine Islands)."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To explain  his inability  to  deliver  this amount of P2,697.47, the defendant alleged  that on the night of the 2d of November, before '9 o'clock, the wooden box which contained the funds of the municipality was broken  open and money taken therefrom by third persons.   He testified that he then had in this box  more than  P2,000.  A large amount of evidence was introduced upon the subject of this  supposed robbery.  It is not necessary  to discuss it here.  It  is sufficient to say that we have examined it carefully and have come to the conclusion that no robbery was  committed, as alleged by the  defendant, or at all.</p>
<p>The judgment of the court below is accordingly affirmed with the costs of this instance against the appellant. After the expiration of ten days from the date of final judgment let the cause be remanded to the lower court for proper procedure.  So ordered.</p>
<em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Carson,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
