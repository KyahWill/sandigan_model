				G.R. No. 8313, March 30, 1914</h4>

				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Plaintiff in this action seeks to have a sale of certain property set aside 
on the ground of the alleged invalidity of the sale; to have the property 
resold; and further, to recover damages alleged to have resulted from the former 
sale.
<p>We are of opinion, however, that the complaint should be dismissed, because, 
first, it appears that the property is not intact, and that it would be wholly 
impracticable to make the resale as prayed by the plaintiff in the event that 
the former sale were annulled; second, because the plaintiff is not shown to 
have been damaged by the sale, nor does it appear that the property was, in 
fact, worth more than it brought at the former sale; and, third, because 
plaintiff seeks to retain his share of the purchase price paid at the former 
sale, and at the same time to have that sale annulled, and to participate in the 
distribution of any moneys which would be received on a resale.</p>
<p>We conclude therefore that the judgment entered in the lower court, annulling 
the sale but without allowing damages, should be reversed, and the complaint 
dismissed without day and without costs in this instance. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Moreland, Trent,</em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.,</em> 
concur.<br></p></div>
