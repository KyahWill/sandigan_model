				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The defendant was convicted in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Batangas of the violation  of section 8 of Act No. 292,  the law defining and punishing treason  and sedition.  He is  the author of the Tagalog drama "<em>Tanikalang Guinto</em>" (The Chain of Gold).  This drama he produced in a theater at Batangas on the 10th day of May, 1903.   The Government claimed and the court below held that the drama was seditious.</p>
<p>The story of the play is as follows:  The heroine, Liwanag, is promised  in  marriage to the hero, K. Ulayaw. Liwanag  is living with her uncle and  adoptive  father, Maimbot, who has given consent to this promise of marriage.  During the progress of the play he withdraws his consent, forbids K. Ulayaw to come to his house, and  by gifts among  others of a gold  chain,  attempts to  induce Liwanag to abandon her lover.  He takes into his employ Nagtapon, a brother of K. Ulayaw, whom he directs to act as a spy upon the  movements of Ulayaw.  Another of the characters in the play is Daiita, the mother of K. Ulayaw and Nagtapon.  Nagtapon disowns her, and she dies in the first act.  The gifts of Maimbot to Liwanag not producing any result, he resorts to harsher measures, binds her to a tree, and places Nagtapon as a watch over her.  K. Ulayaw, searching for her, finds her in this condition, and is killed by Nagtapon.   The play ends with  the translation  of Liwanag to the heavens.</p>
<p>This play on its face seems to be an ordinary love story with an unfortunate  termination.  It  is  claimed by the Government, however, that  it was  intended to represent the relations between the Government of ,the United States and the Philippines,  the claim being that Maimbot represents  the  United  States, Nagtapon  those  Filipinos friendly to the United States, K. Ulayaw the Filipinos who desire independence, Liwanag the Philippines,  and Daiita the mother country.  It is said that this significance can be given to the play by reason of the meaning of the names of the characters.  The word "Liwanag" in Tagalog means "light" or "dawn of day" (<em>luz o aurora</em>); "Daiita," "punishment, grief;" "K. Ulayaw," "lover" (<em>amante</em>) "Nagtapon," "spendthrift, renegade"  (<em>prodigo o renegado</em>); "Mainibot," "ambitious or avaricious" (<em>ambicioso o avaro</em>). It is not apparent,  however, how the seditious character of the play can be derived from the names of the  characters.</p>
<p>In  the play itself there are  but few  passages which  in any  way indicate that the play is anything more than  it purports to be upon its face.  The word "independence"  or "independent" occurs five times in the course of the play, but always in connection with the marriage of Liwanag and K. Ulayaw, and with their maintenance of a house separate and apart from the house of her uncle.  The word "pueblo" occurs three or four times in the play, and there is a scene in which Maimbot and Nagtapon are becoming intoxicated, and in which the former  says that they must accustom themselves to this and sleep in the streets.</p>
<p>This is practically all there  is in the play which tends to support the theory of the Government, and we think it is very far from doing so.  It is possible  to give to almost any play a different meaning than that intended by the author.  To the writings of the greatest dramatists have been given meanings of which the author never thought.</p>
<p>That the public who witnessed this performance at the theater in Batangas did not understand the play as meaning what the Government claims it means is apparent from the. testimony of some of the Government's own witnesses. Jose Villanueva, one of those witnesses, testified as follows on cross-examination:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Q.  Could the audience understand the symbolism used by the author to represent his play?—A. I  can  not say exactly, but I think that only a few understood the purpose of the play."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alfredo Cantos, another of the Government's witnesses, testified as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Q.  What political effect was produced  by the drama among the audience?—A. I heard but few of the spectators comment upon the symbolical references to the relation of the United States with the Philippines.</p>
  <p>"Q. What was your impression as to the purpose of the drama considering the class of  people who attended the performance?—A.  Many of them were glad to see it, but I can not tell whether it was because  of the eloquent and poetical phrases used or because they were aware of the fact  that  the play dealt with the relations between  the Philippines and the United States."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Simeon Luz, another witness for the Government, and the governor of the province, testified  as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Q. Could the public understand the  meaning of the drama?—A. The intelligent part of the audience probably understood it, but I do not think the masses—that is, the great majority  Of  the spectators—understood  the  same, unless the characters of the play were explained to  them.</p>
  <p>"Q. You, as the highest official of the province—did you have an opportunity to judge of the effect produced by the play upon the audience?—A.  I did not, because I did not see the drama myself.   All I can say is that apparently it was very much applauded, although I can not tell whether it was applauded because of its dramatic value or because of its real significance.  In my opinion, I should say that the drama in question is one of the best plays written in Tagalog."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was proved at the trial that this drama, prior  to its presentation at  Batangas, had been presented  more than twenty times in different theaters of Manila, La Laguna, and Cavite, the  first of these representations commencing in October, 1902.  The defendant, the author, testified that after three representations  in Manila, he had read in a newspaper that  an order had been issued  by  the public authorities requiring that all plays, before their presentation,  should  be submitted for examination to the division of information.  He thereupon took his play to the  office of John F.  Green and left it there for examination.  It was returned to him  the next day, with authority to present it. There was no evidence to contradict this  statement, although  there is  some evidence to show that one day was not a sufficient time for a proper examination of the work. However this may be, it is apparent that the play was not considered seditious by the authorities of Manila.</p>
<p>An examination of the dramas which were considered in the cases  of the United  States <em>vs</em>.  Tolentino,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> No.  1451, decided March 6, 1906, and of the United States <em>vs</em>. Cruz,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> No. 2128,  will show that anyone reading these dramas or seeing them presented  could not  fail  to understand  their seditious tendencies, something  which,  according to the witnesses of the  Government in this case, a great majority of the spectators of this drama could not see.</p>
<p>The judgment of the court below is reversed  and the defendant acquitted, with the costs of both instances <em>de oficio.</em> At the expiration of ten days judgment should be entered in accordance with this decision and the case remanded to the court below for execution of said judgment. So ordered.</p>
<em>Torres, Mapa, Carson,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ., </em>concur.<br>
