				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Final judgment having been entered in this court in the above-entitled 
cause,<span class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> an appeal to the Supreme Court of 
the United States was allowed by one of the members of this court, who at the 
same time directed that a certified transcript of the proceedings be transmitted 
to that court upon the filing by the petitioner of a supersedeas bond in the sum 
of $20,000 United States currency approved by him.
<p>Thereafter the citation of the plaintiff company was duly signed and a 
supersedeas bond in the amount indicated was accepted and approved by the member 
of the court who allowed the appeal.</p>
<p>One of the sureties whose name is signed to the supersedeas bond now moves 
this court td permit him to withdraw from the bond, and, further, to relieve him 
from all liability thereunder. </p>
<p>The acceptance of the bond and the signing of the citation by one of the 
justices of this court transferred the jurisdiction of the cause appealed to the 
Supreme Court of the United States. The power of the justice over the appeal and 
the security, in the absence of fraud, was exhausted when he took the security 
and signed the citation. "From that time the control of the supersedeas as well 
as the appeal was transferred to the Supreme Court of the United States." 
(Draper <em>vs.</em> Davis, 102 U. S., 370.)</p>
<p>In the case of Jerome <em>vs.</em> McCarter (21 Wall., 17), the Supreme Court 
of the United States, in discussing.the jurisdiction of a justice to take 
security on allowing an appeal to that court said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The justice who takes the security on appeal is the sole and exclusive judge 
of what it should be, and his decision is final, unless he violates a statute or 
a rule of practice."</p></blockquote>
<p>And again, in the case of Morrin <em>vs.</em> Lawler (91 Fed. Rep., 693), it 
was said that the practice in the Federal courts prescribes thatâ€”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When all the steps necessary to perfect an appeal to an appellate court have 
been properly taken, the action is within the control of that court and the 
trial court should not engage in undoing or modifying the proceeding by which 
such jurisdiction'has been obtained." </p></blockquote>
<p>We think that under these rulings and upon principle it is manifest that this 
court has no jurisdiction to hear and decide this application by the bondsmen, 
which would necessarily have the effect of annulling the bond and vacating the 
supersedeas, and perhaps of terminating further proceedings on the appeal. The 
appeal was allowed and the transcript of the record ordered certified to the 
court above, on condition that an approved bond be filed with the record.</p>
<p>The motion is denied.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Moreland,</em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.,</em> 
concur.</p>
