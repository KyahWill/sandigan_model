				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. FRANCISCO BAUTISTA ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The appellants in this case were convicted in the Court of First Instance of Manila of the crime of conspiracy to overthrow, put down,  and destroy by force the. Government of the  United States in the Philippine Islands and the Government of the Philippine Islands, as defined and penalized  in section 4  of Act  No. 292 of the Philippine Commission.</p>
<p>The appellant Francisco Bautista was sentenced to four years'  imprisonment, with hard labor, and $3,000 fine, and Aniceto de Guzman and Tomas Puzon, and each of them, to three years' imprisonment, with hard labor, and a fine of $2,000,  and all and  each of the said appellants  to pay their proportionate share of  the costs of the trial  and to undergo subsidiary imprisonment in the event of insolvency and failure to pay their respective fines.</p>
<p>The evidence of record conclusively establishes that during the latter part of the year 1903 a <em>junta</em> was organized and a  conspiracy entered into  by a  number of Filipinos, resident in the city of Hongkong, for the purpose of overthrowing the Government of the United States in the Philippine Islands by force  of arms  and establishing in its stead a government to be known as the <em>Republica Universal Democratica  Filipinos</em>; that one Prim Ruiz was recognized as the titular head of this conspiracy and one Artemio Ricarte as chief of the military forces to be organized in the Philippines in the furtherance of the plans of the conspirators; that toward the end  of December, 1903 the said Ricarte came to Manila from Hongkong in hiding on board the steamship <em>Yuensang</em>; that after his arrival in the Philippines he held a number of meetings in the city of Manila and the adjoining provinces whereat was  perfected the above-mentioned conspiracy hatched in Hongkong; that at these meetings new members were taken into the conspiracy and plans made for the enlistment  of an army of revolution and the raising of  money by national and private loans to carry on the campaign; that to  this end bonds were issued and commissions as officers in the revolutionary army were granted to a number of conspirators, empowering the officers thus appointed to raise troops and take command thereof; and that the conspirators did in fact take the field and offered armed resistance to the constituted authorities in the Philippines, only failing in their design of overthrowing the Government because of their failure to combat successfully with the officers of the law who were sent against them and of the failure of the people to rise <em>en masse</em> in response to their propaganda.</p>
<p>It further appears from the evidence that the appellant Francisco Bautista, a resident of the city of Manila,  was an intimate friend of the said Ricarte;  that Ricarte wrote and notified Bautista of his coming to Manila and that, to aid him  in his journey, Bautista  forwarded to him secretly 200 pesos; that after the arrival of Ricarte, Bautista was  present,,taking part in several of the above-mentioned meetings whereat the plans of the conspirators were discussed and perfected,  and that at one of  these meetings Bautista, in answer to a question of Ricarte, assured him  that the necessary  preparations had  been made and that he "held the people in readiness."</p>
<p>It further  appears that the appellant, Tomas Puzon, united with the conspirators through  the agency of  one R. Muñoz,  who was proven to have been a  prime leader  of the  movement, in  the  intimate confidence of Ricarte, and by  him authorized to distribute bonds and nominate and appoint certain officials, including a brigadier-general of the signal corps of the proposed revolutionary forces; that at the time when the conspiracy was being brought to a head in the city of Manila, Puzon held several conferences with  the said Muñoz whereat plans were made for the coming  insurrection; that at one of these  conferences Muñoz offered Puzon a commission  as brigadier-general of the signal corps of the revolutionary forces and that Puzon accepted the commission and voluntarily united himself with the conspirators and undertook to do his part in organizing troops; and that at a later conference he assured the said  Muñoz that  he had things in readiness, meaning thereby  that he had duly organized in accordance with the terms of his commission.</p>
<p>Puzon at the trial declared that he had never united himself with the conspirators; that  he had accepted the appointment as brigadier-general  of the  signal corps of the revolutionary forces with  no intention of ever taking any further action in the matter,  and merely because he did not wish to vex his friend Muñoz by refusing to do so; and that  when Muñoz offered him  the appointment as brigadier-general  he did so in "a  joking tone"  and that he, Puzon, did not know that Ricarte was in Manila organizing the conspiracy at that time.</p>
<p>These statements, however  (except  in  so  far  as they corroborate  the testimony of Muñoz as to the fact that he had had several interviews with Puzon at which plans were entered into for  the advancement of the cause of  the conspirators), can not be  accepted as true in the light of a written statement signed by Puzon himself at the time when he was first  arrested, part of which is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Q. What is your name and what is your age, residence, and occupation?—A.  My name is  Tom&amp;s Puzon; born in Binondo,  in the  Province of  Manila; 37 years  of age; married; by profession a teacher of primary and secondary schools, and residing in Calle Concepcion, No. 195, district of Quiapo.</p>
  <p>"Q.  Do you know Artemio Ricarte?—A. Personally I do not know him, but by name, yes.</p>
  <p>"Q.  Did you have any information that Ricarte was in these Islands and with what object he came here?  And if you know it to be true,  through whom did you get such information?—A. In the first place I had notice of his coming to the Islands as well as his object by reading the newspapers of Manila, and secondly  because J. R. Munoz told me the same on one  occasion when I was in his house to visit him.</p>
  <p>"Q.  Did you acquire this information through any other person?—A. No, sir; I have no more information than that which I have mentioned.</p>
  <p>"Q.  Are you a part of this new revolution presided over by Ricarte?—A. Yes, sir.</p>
  <p>"Q.  What is the employment (empleo) which you have in this organization and  who is it who invited you to join it?—A. J. R. Muñoz, who is general of division of this new organization, spoke to me with much insistence, asking me to accept employment as  brigadier-general,  chief of signal corps, to which I, on account of his request and in view of the fact that the said Muñoz is a friend of mine from my youth, acceded; nevertheless I have organized absolutely nothing in respect to this matter.</p>
  <p>"Q.  Did you accept this employment and did they give you any  commission for it?—A.  Yes, sir; I  accepted said employment and although they gave me an order to organize my brigade I did not do it, because I had neither the confidence nor the will.</p>
  <p>"Q.  If you didn't have faith in the said organization nor the will to carry out what was intrusted to you, why did you accept employment as general of the brigade?—A. I accepted it on account of friendship and not to vex a friend, but I never had the intention of fulfilling the obligations." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Puzon, When on the stand in his own behalf, did not deny that he made this statement, but he attempted to explain it away  by saying that when he made it he was so excited that he did not know just what he was saying.  He does not allege that improper means were taken to procure the confession, and it was proven at the trial that it was freely and voluntarily made and not the result of violence, intimidation, threat,  menace, or promise of reward or leniency.   The accused appears to be an  intelligent man and was for eighteen years a school-teacher and later a telegraph  operator under the Spanish  Government,  and during the insurrection he held a commission as an officer in the signal corps of the revolutionary army.  His  confession is clear and intelligible and in no way supports his pretense that he was so  excited as not to know what he was saying when he made it, and its truth and accuracy in so far as it inculpates him is sustained  by other evidence of record in this case.</p>
<p>It is contended that the acceptance or possession of an appointment as an officer of the  military forces of the conspiracy should not be considered as evidence against him in the light of the decisions of this  court in the cases of the United States <em>vs</em>. Antonio de log Reyes<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> (2 Off. Gaz., 364), United States <em>vs</em>. Silverio Nunez et al.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> (3 Off. Gaz., 408), United States <em>vs</em>. Eusebio de la Serna et al.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> (3  Off. Gaz., 528), and United States <em>vs</em>. Bernardo Manalo et al.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> (4  Off. Gaz., 570).   But the case at  bar is to be  distinguished from these and  like cases  by the fact  that the record clearly discloses that the accused actually  and voluntarily accepted  the  appointment in question and in doing so  assumed all the obligations  implied by such acceptance, and that the charge in  this  case is  that of conspiracy, and the  fact that  the accused accepted  the appointment is taken  irito consideration merely as evidence of his criminal relations with  the conspirators.  In  the first of these cases—the United States <em>vs</em>.  De los Reyes— the accused was charged with treason, and the court found that the mere acceptance of a commission by the defendant, nothing else  being done either by himself or  by his companions,  was not an' "overt  act"  of treason within  the meaning of the law, but the court  further expressly held that—</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The state of affairs disclosed by the evidence,  *  *  * the playing of the game of government  like children, the secretaries, colonels, and captains, the  pictures of flags and seals, and commissions, all on paper, for the purpose of duping and misleading the ignorant and the visionary, *  *  *  should not be dignified by the name of treason."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the second case—the United States <em>vs</em>. Nunez et al.— wherein the accused were charged with brigandage,  the court held that, aside from the, possession of commissions in an insurgent band, there was no evidence to show that they  had committed the crime and,  "moreover,  that it appeared that they had never united with any party of brigands  and never had been in any way connected with such parties unless the physical possession of these appointments proved such relation," and that it appeared that each one  of the defendants were separately approached at different  times by armed men while working in the field and were virtually compelled to accept the commissions."</p>
<p>In  the case of the United States <em>vs</em>. de la Serna et aL it was contended that de la Serna had confessed that "he was one of the members of the pulajanes, with a commission as colonel,"  but  the court was of opinion that  the evidence did not sustain a finding  that such confession had in fact; been  made, hence the doctrine laid down in that decision, "that the mere possession of such an  appointment, when it is not shown that the possessor  executed some external act by virtue of the same, does not constitute sufficient proof of the guilt of the  defendant," applies only to the case of Enrique Oamonas, against whom the only evidence of record was "the fact that  a so-called  appointment of sergeant was found at his house."</p>
<p>In  the case of the United States <em>vs</em>. Bernardo Manalo et al. there  was testimony that four appointments of  officials in a revolutionary army were found in a trunk in the house of one Valentin Colorado, and the court in said case reaffirmed the doctrine that "the mere  possession of documents of this kind is not  sufficient to  convict," and held, furthermore, that there was "evidence  in the case that at the time  these papers  were received  by the, appellant, Valentin Colorado, he went to one of the assistant councilmen  of  the  barrio in which  he  lived, a witness for the Government, showed him the envelope, and stated to him that he had received these papers; that he didn't know what they were and requested this councilman to open them. The councilman  did not wish to do  that but took the envelope and sent it to the councilman Jose Millora.  We are satisfied that this envelope contained the appointments in question and that the appellant did not act under the appointment but immediately reported  the receipt of them to the authorities."</p>
<p>It is quite conceivable that a group of conspirators might appoint a person  in  no wise connected with them to some high office in the  conspiracy, in the hope that such person would  afterwards accept  the commission and thus  unite himself with them, and it is even possible that such an appointment might be forwarded in the mail or otherwise, and thus come into the possession of the person thus nominated, and that such appointment might be found in his possession, and, notwithstanding  all  this, the  person in whose  possession the appointment was found might be entirely innocent of all intention  to join the conspiracy, never having authorized the conspirators to use his name in this manner nor to send such a commission to him. Indeed, cases are not unknown in the  annals of criminal prosecutions wherein it has been proven that such appointments  have been  concealed in the baggage or among the papers of the accused persons, so that when later discovered by the officers of  the law they might be used as evidence against the accused.  But where a genuine conspiracy is shown  to have existed as in this case, and it is proven that the accused voluntarily accepted  an  appointment, as  an officer  in  that  conspiracy, we think  that this fact may properly be taken into consideration  as  evidence of his relations with the conspirators.</p>
<p>Counsel for appellants  contend  that the constitutional provision requiring the testimony of at  least two witnesses to the same overt act, or confession in  open court,  to support a conviction for the crime of treason should be applied in this case, but this court has always held, in confonnance with the decisions  of  the Federal courts of the  United States, that the crime of conspiring to commit treason is a separate and distinct offense from the crime of treason, and that this constitutional provision is not applicable in such cases.  (<em>In re</em> Bollman, 4 Cranch, 74; U. S. <em>vs</em>. Mitchell, 2 Dall., 348.)</p>
<p>The evidence of record does not sustain the conviction of Aniceto  de Guzman.  The finding of  his guilt rests substantially upon his acceptance Of a number of bonds from one of the conspirators, such bonds having been prepared by the conspirators for the purpose of raising funds for carrying out the plans of the conspiracy, but it does  not affirmatively appear that he knew anything of the existence of  the conspiracy or  that, when he  received the bonds wrapped in a bundle, he knew  what the contents of  the bundle was, nor that he ever, on any occasion, assumed any obligation with respect to these bonds.  He, himself, states that when he opened the bundle  and discovered the nature of the contents he destroyed them with fire, and that he never had any dealings with the conspirators in relation to the conspiracy or the object for which it was organized. A We are of opinion, therefore, that the judgment and sentence before  us, in so far  as it affects the said Aniceto de Guzman, should be reversed,  with  his proportionate share of the costs of both instances <em>de oficio</em>, and that the said Aniceto de Guzman should be acquitted of the crime with which he is charged and set at liberty forthwith, and that the judgment and sentence of the trial court, in so far as it applies to Francisco Bautista and Tomas Puzon, should be, and is hereby, affirmed, except in so far as it imposes subsidiary imprisonment  in the event of insolvency and failure to pay  their respective fines, and, there being no authority in law for such provision, so much of the sentence as undertakes to impose subsidiary imprisonment is hereby reversed.</p>
<p>After ten days  let judgment be entered in accordance herewith, when the record will  be returned to  the trial court for execution. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J.,  Torres, Johnson,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<em>Mapa</em> and <em>Willard, JJ.,</em> concur as to the penalty imposed upon Bautista and.dissent as to that imposed upon Puzon.<br>
