				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This defendant was charged with the crime of seduction, alleged to have been committed as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"In or during the month of May, 1908, the said accused, who was a public official, being president of the municipal board of health, and an inmate or guest in  the  house of Bernardo Gonzalez,  made love to the latter's  daughter, an unmarried girl  going on eighteen years, who lived in the same house,  and by means of perfidious promises of marriage succeeded  in deceiving her, making her  believe in his false declarations of love, and had carnal intercourse with her many times in the months of October, November, December, 1908, and March, 1909, wherefrom she  became pregnant.  The act occurred in  the municipality of San Isidro, Province of Nueva Ecija, P.  I., in violation of law."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The present action was commenced on the  5th of June, 1909, in the court of the justice of the peace  of the pueblo of San Isidro, Province of Nueva Ecija.  The complaint was  presented and signed by the prosecuting attorney of said province.  The  justice  of the peace  held a preliminary examination  and found that there was probable  cause for believing that the defendant was guilty of the crime charged and  held him for trial in the Court of First Instance of said province.</p>
<p>On the 27th  day of  September,  1909, the above complaint was filed  in  the Court of First  Instance  of  said province by the prosecuting attorney.  No complaint  was presented either by the aggrieved person or by her parents, grandparents, or guardian, in accordance with the provisions of section 1 of Act  No. 1773, neither in the  court of the justice of the  peace nor in the Court of First Instance.</p>
<p>After  hearing the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause, the Honorable Julio Llorente, judge, found the defendant guilty of  the crime,  with the aggravating circumstance of a grave abuse of confidence,  and sentenced him to be imprisoned for a  period of two years eleven months and eleven days of <em>prision correccional</em>, with the accessories of the law, to recognize and maintain the child of  Virginia Gonzales, and to pay to  the said Virginia Gonzales the sum of P500, in case of insolvency to suffer subsidiary imprisonment, and to pay the costs.</p>
<p>From that sentence the defendant appealed  and  assigned as error in this  court  that the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause was not sufficient to show that the defendant was guilty of the crime charged.</p>
<p>During the  pendency of the cause in this court and probably after the brief of the appellant had been printed,  he presented a motion asking that said cause be dismissed for the reason that the complaint presented in the court below had not been presented by the offended party, her parents, grandparents, or guardian.   The consideration of this motion was deferred until the cause should be presented upon its merits.</p>
<p>Section 1 of Act  No.  1773 provides  that the  crimes  of <em>adulterio, estupro, rapto,  violation, calumnia</em>, and <em>injuria,</em> as defined by the Penal Code, shall be deemed to be public crimes, and shall be prosecuted in the same manner as all other crimes  under  said  code,  with  the proviso that the prosecution of the crimes of <em>adulterio, estupro,</em> and <em>injuria,</em> committed  <em>against persons  other than  public officials  or employees,</em> shall not be instituted except upon the  complaint of the aggrieved person,  or  of the parents, grandparents or guardian of such  person.</p>
<p>This  court  has  held in  the following cases:  U.  S.  <em>vs.</em> Narvas (Nov. 9, 1909, seduction, 14 Phil. Rep., 410)  ; U.  S. <em>vs.</em> De la Cruz  (Sept. 27, 1910, injurias graves, 17 Phil. Rep.,  139) ; U. S. <em>vs.</em> Castanares  (Jan.  4, 1911, <em>injurias graves,</em> 18 Phil. Rep., 210) ;  U. S.  <em>vs.</em> Ortiz and Regalado (March 23, 1911, adultery, 19 Phil. Rep., 174), that where the complaint is not presented by the offended party, her parents, grandparents or guardian, that the court acquires no jurisdiction over the  person of the defendant nor the subject matter of the action.</p>
<p>For  the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the lower court  convicting the  defendant of the  crime  of  seduction is  hereby reversed,   the  information  dismissed and the defendant ordered discharged from the  custody of the law with costs <em>de oficio.</em></p>
<p><em> Arellano,  C. J., Torres, Mapa, Carson, Moreland,</em> and <em>Trent,  JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
