				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On April 6, 1908, the municipal&nbsp; president of Tacloban, Province of Leyte, filed an application in the Court of Land Registration,&nbsp; in&nbsp; representation&nbsp; of&nbsp; the said&nbsp; municipality, soliciting the inscription in the registry, in conformity with the law, of a parcel of land which it was alleged belonged to the municipality mentioned,&nbsp; as&nbsp; absolute owner of the same,&nbsp; situated within&nbsp; the town proper&nbsp; of&nbsp; Tacloban, not comprised&nbsp; within the reservation,&nbsp; bounded on&nbsp; the&nbsp; north by the land owned by the Chinaman&nbsp; La Layco, on the south by Calle San Roque, on&nbsp; the east by the lands belonging to Hilarion Asuncion&nbsp; and&nbsp; the municipality referred to, and on the west by Calle Rizal.&nbsp; The application further recited that the land concerned contained an area of 4,054.85 square meters, the description and boundaries of&nbsp; which were given in detail in the accompanying plan;&nbsp; that the said land was appraised&nbsp; at the last assessment, for&nbsp; the purpose of the payment of the land tax, at $3,041, United States currency; that there&nbsp; was no&nbsp; incumbrance on&nbsp; the property,&nbsp; nor did any&nbsp; person have&nbsp; any right or&nbsp; interest therein,&nbsp; except the applicant;&nbsp; that it was&nbsp; acquired&nbsp; by&nbsp; being filled in by the municipality&nbsp; in 1893&nbsp; and 1894; and that it was&nbsp; then occupied by the houses&nbsp; of Vicenta&nbsp; Bagay, Victor Cipres, Cirila Almeria, Sinforoso Labajo, Manuel Catalan, Hilaria Opiiio, Dalmacio Agaton, Gervasio Brillantes, Manuel Padilla, Rosa&nbsp; Juson, and Teresa Escorial.&nbsp; The applicant furthermore stated that, in case of the remote possibility of his appl:cation not being admissible under the Land Registration Act,&nbsp; he would, as municipal president, claim the&nbsp; benefits offered by&nbsp; Chapter&nbsp; VI&nbsp; of Act No.&nbsp; 926,&nbsp; inasmuch as the municipality had been in possession of the land since&nbsp; 1893, had used it for building purposes for the past fifteen years, and&nbsp; the&nbsp; property was&nbsp;&nbsp; inclosed&nbsp; on two&nbsp; of its sides by buildings.<br><br>On June 8, by reason of the summons and publications made in connection with the&nbsp; action taken on&nbsp; the aforementioned&nbsp; application,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Attorney-General&nbsp; appeared in representation&nbsp; of the Director of Lands and opposed the applicant's petition, on the ground that the land in question belonged to the Government of the United States and was under the control of the Government of these Islands, and asked that the registration applied for be denied.<br><br>The case came to trial on January 18, 1909; the court, in view of&nbsp; the oral&nbsp; evidence adduced by the applicant, rendered judgment by decreeing, after entry of a&nbsp; general default, the adjudication&nbsp; and&nbsp; registration&nbsp; of the property described in the application and plan&nbsp; aforementioned, in favor of the applicant, in conformity with the provisions of Act No, 926.&nbsp; To this judgment the Attorney-General took exception&nbsp; and moved for&nbsp; a new trial on the grounds that the court's findings of fact were openly and manifestly contrary to the weight of the evidence&nbsp; and that the latter did not warrant&nbsp; the conclusions of the judgment, which judgment was contrary to law.&nbsp; This motion was overruled, exception was taken by the Solicitor-General and the proper bill of exceptions having been filed, the same was certified to and forwarded to the clerk of this court.<br><br>The land sought to be inscribed in the property registry by the municipality of Tacloban, was, prior to 1891-1892, a mangrove swamp which was inundated by&nbsp; the water of a nearby <i>estero,</i>&nbsp; although situated&nbsp; within the&nbsp; town proper,&nbsp; and was&nbsp; gradually&nbsp; filled in by&nbsp; order of the&nbsp; said municipality, between&nbsp; the years 1892 and 1894,&nbsp; when it was&nbsp; successively occupied by the houses of several of the residents of&nbsp; Tacloban,&nbsp; as the&nbsp; portions&nbsp; of the&nbsp; land&nbsp; were successively raised m level and freed from the water.<br><br>Since then, the municipality has exercised control over the said&nbsp; land and found&nbsp; it&nbsp; to&nbsp; its interest to collect rents from those who, without impediment of any kind, occupied it with their dwellings.&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding the&nbsp; effoits and labor expended by the municipality in improving the land for the benefit of the town, by reducing&nbsp; more and more the inundated area, and it is unquestionable that the said land, which&nbsp; was originally a mangrove swamp and was little by little&nbsp; converted&nbsp; into habitable ground, was and is unappropriated land belonging to the State; that it has not been granted or conveyed to any private party, nor to the municipality itself, without which condition it could not be considered as private property.<br><br>It was not shown that any building belonging to the municipality of Tacloban and intended for the public service was erected on the said land, nor that the property had been conveyed to the aforementioned municipality to form a part of the municipal assets or estate; therefore&nbsp; it can not be considered as&nbsp; one of the patrimonial&nbsp; properties of the municipality, nor entered in&nbsp; the name of the same in the property registry.<br><br>The mere fact that the municipality of Tacloban continued to charge and collect rents from the persons who built houses upon and occupied portions of the said land, is not proof that the municipality was the proprietor, for, as it had erected thereon no building intended for the service of the pueblo -&nbsp; a circumstance which, had it&nbsp; existed, would have led to the presumption&nbsp; that,&nbsp; in&nbsp; obtaining permission&nbsp; to erect the building, it also obtained&nbsp; a grant, if only an implied one, of the land, from the Government in the name of the State -&nbsp; in order that the said municipality may be deemed to be the owner of the land in question, it&nbsp; must prove that an express grant of the said land, as one of the properties that form a part of its patrimony, was made to it by the Government.<br><br>The municipality&nbsp; may be,&nbsp; at the most, a usufructuary of the&nbsp; land&nbsp; in&nbsp; question,&nbsp; but not the proprietor thereof having the right to enter the same in the property registry. <br></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">It is true that the&nbsp; land&nbsp; herein&nbsp; concerned is neither mineral nor forest land, but is comprised within the term of agricultural land; yet the&nbsp; mere&nbsp; occupation of the said property by the municipality&nbsp; during more than ten years immediately preceding the passage&nbsp; of&nbsp; Act No. 926,&nbsp; which went into effect on July 26, 1904,&nbsp; can not serve as a title&nbsp; whereby to acquire the ownership thereof pursuant to the provisions of paragraph&nbsp; 6 of section 54 of Act No. 926, inasmuch as, to do so, it is necessary that the municipality shall have an implied or express grant from the Government, without the&nbsp; fulfillment of which requisite it&nbsp; can not&nbsp; be&nbsp; presumed&nbsp; that&nbsp; a municipality&nbsp; owns and holds in good faith realty admittedly belonging to the State, enabling it to convert the&nbsp; same into <i>terreno propio</i>&nbsp; so&nbsp; as to form a part of its estate or municipal assets.<br><br>The benefit granted by section 54 of the said Act, to foster agriculture and increase the wealth of the country, can not be deemed to be granted, according to economic principles, to the municipal&nbsp; corporations which, on account of their special&nbsp; conditions, the&nbsp; idiosyncrasy and character of the functions which they exercise, and because of&nbsp; the administrative mission&nbsp; which they have to&nbsp; fulfill in the name of the Government and at the same time in representation of the people who elected them, can not engage in agriculture and other pursuits, nor&nbsp; can they, attend to the development, cultivation, or administration of agricultural land, and give special attention to other business, proper only&nbsp; for private parties, and other&nbsp; undertakings especially&nbsp; designed&nbsp; for their promotion, without serious&nbsp; detriment to the interests of the community.<br><br>Finally,&nbsp; it is to&nbsp; be&nbsp; noted that the said land&nbsp; situated within the town, is not common land or pasture land (<i>terreno o dehesa comunal</i>),&nbsp; because this&nbsp; class of land was usually laid off&nbsp; outside of&nbsp; the town; it had to be uncultivated land, and was granted for the pasturage&nbsp; of stock and for other needs of the pueblo, in accordance with an express&nbsp; provision of the law.<br><br>For the foregoing reasons, it&nbsp; is our&nbsp; opinion&nbsp; that&nbsp; the judgment appealed from&nbsp; should&nbsp; be reversed and the case dismissed, without special finding as to costs.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Johnson, Carson, Moreland, </i>and <i>Trent, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><i><br>Arellano, C. J.</i>, and <i>Mapa, J.</i>, dissent.<br></div>
