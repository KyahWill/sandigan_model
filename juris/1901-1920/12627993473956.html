				<h4>
				G.R. No. 2772, September 21, 1906</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. LOUIS A. UNSELT, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>There was evidence in the case sufficient to prove that the defendant, Unselt, after the promulgation of Act No. 518 relating to brigandage, and prior to his  first arrest on the  5th day of February, 1903, committed acts which were in violation of that law.   After he, was arrested  in February, he entered into the service of the Constabulary as a detective.  He was discharged from such service and again arrested in July, 1903.</p>
<p>Whether during this time, and particularly in connection with his visit to the camp of Felizardo, he committed any acts in violation of law we have not inquired because we are satisfied that the evidence as to acts committed prior to his first arrest is sufficient to sustain the judgment.</p>
<p>The defendant claims that after his first arrest he entered into the service of the Constabulary  under the promise that he should not be prosecuted  for any acts committed prior to that time.  We have not considered whether such promises were or were not made, for with this question we have nothing to do.</p>
<p>If they were made they would not constitute any defense to this action.</p>
<p>The  judgment of the court below is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant. </p>
<p>After the expiration of ten days let final  judgment be entered in  accordance herewith and ten days thereafter let the  case be returned  to the  court below for proper action.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Carson,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ., </em>concur.<br>
