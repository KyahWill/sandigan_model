				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Section 21 of our Code of Civil Procedure makes it the duty of the Supreme Court, among other causes, to remove or suspend a member of the Philippine Bar for any deceit, malpractice, or gross misconduct in his office of lawyer.&nbsp; Disagreeable as such action is, this provision of law must be applied to Pedro G. Paraiso, the respondent lawyer, who attempted to&nbsp; obtain, and did in&nbsp; fact obtain, a small sum from his client which he converted to his own use through the false pretense of paying a fine in&nbsp; a criminal case when no fine had been imposed.&nbsp; The proceedings thus rest on facts criminal in nature, although not intended to determine the culpability of an accused, but&nbsp; instituted for the purpose of ascertaining if the lawyer is possessed of that good moral character which is a condition precedent to the privilege of practicing law and of continuing in the practice thereof.&nbsp; The lawyer who has thus violated his oath of office, betrayed the confidence reposed in him by a client, and practiced deceit, cannot be permitted to retain the position of a practitioner at law.&nbsp; Not alone has he degraded himself but as an unfaithful lawyer he has besmirched&nbsp; the fair name of an honorable profession.<br><br>It is therefore ordered that the license to practice law heretofore issued to Pedro G. Paraiso be suspended for six months to begin from this date.&nbsp; The costs shall be taxed in accordance with section 24 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br><br><i>Mapa, C. J., Araullo, Avance√±a, Moir</i> and <i>Villamor, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><br><center><br><i>CONCURRING</i><br></center><br><br><b>CARSON, <i>J., </i></b><br><br>I concur although I incline to think that the penalty is not severe enough in view of the findings.</div>
