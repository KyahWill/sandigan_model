				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The only question presented by this appeal is whether or not a judge of the 
Court of First Instance, in actions like the present, on an appeal from the 
decision of the Collector of Customs, may modify the decision of the Collector 
of Customs and render a judgment in accordance with his findings of fact.
<p>It appears from the record that the steamship <em>Chinese Prince,</em> 
belonging to the "Prince Line," arrived at Manila on the 7th day of July, 1916, 
with 2,012 packages of Philippine cargo which was a less number of packages than 
was manifested for delivery at the port of Manila. When the Collector of Customs 
was informed that all of the cargo manifested for the port of Manila had not 
been delivered, the master of the said steamship was cited to appear and show 
cause why his ship should not be seized for his failure to deliver such cargo, 
and why he should not be required to pay a fine for such failure, in accordance 
with section 1506 of Act No. 2657 (The Administrative Code; sec. 303 of Act No. 
355). A hearing was had, at the conclusion of which the Collector of Customs 
found that the master of said steamship had been negligent in not delivering 
said cargo, and imposed upon said steamship a fine of P25 for each package 
manifested and not delivered. From that order the plaintiff appealed to the 
Court of First Instance. The Court of First Instance, after hearing the evidence 
adduced before it, modified the order of the Collector of Customs and imposed a 
fine of 50 centavos for each and every package not delivered, together with 
costs. From that judgment both the plaintiff and defendant appealed to this 
court.</p>
<p>The defendant, in his appeal, presents the question above indicated. The 
plaintiff prays that the judgment of the Court of First Instance be 
affirmed.</p>
<p>Section 1534 of said Act (No. 2657) provides that—</p>
<p>"The party aggrieved by the decision of the Insular Collector in any matter 
brought before him upon protest or by his action or decision in any case of 
seizure may procure the cause to be removed for review into the Court of First 
Instance sitting in the city of Manila."</p>
<p>Section 1542 of said Act (No. 2657) provides that—</p>
<p>"A customs cause removed into the Court of First Instance * * * shall be 
determined upon the record, including the competent proof already taken, <em>and 
such other evidence as either party may see fit to adduce</em>—all subject to 
the same right of exception and appeal to the Supreme Court, by either party, as 
in other cases."</p>
<p>By said quoted sections it will be seen—(a) That the Courts of First Instance 
may review the decisions of the Collector of Customs in any case of seizure, in 
cases like the present; and (b) that the Courts of First Instance shall 
determine the questions presented by the record, together with such other 
evidence as either party may see fit to adduce. The parties to the appeal are, 
therefore, permitted to adduce additional proof in the Court of First Instance. 
If they may adduce additional proof, then the facts presented to the Court of 
First Instance may be very different, or at least greatly modified, from the 
facts presented to the Collector of Customs. And if the facts which are 
presented to the Court of First Instance may be different from the facts 
presented before the Collector of Customs, and if the Court of First Instance 
shall determine the issues upon the record, including additional evidence, then 
certainly the Legislature intended by said sections 1534 and 1542 that the Court 
of First Instance should render a judgment upon such facts, without any 
reference to the decision of the Collector of Customs, except perhaps as it 
might be influenced by the findings of fact by the Collector of Customs.</p>
<p>The rule that the conclusions of the Collector of Customs are final and 
conclusive unless an abuse of authority is shown does not apply to cases like 
the present. The law expressly provides that his findings and conclusions may be 
reviewed by the courts, and that the courts may not only consider the evidence 
adduced before him, but may hear additional proof and may render a judgment in 
accordance with the facts adduced in the Court of First Instance.</p>
<p>No question is presented in the present case concerning the sufficiency of 
the evidence adduced during the hearing in the Court of First Instance to 
support the conclusion of the lower court. It is unnecessary, therefore, to 
discuss the evidence.</p>
<p>The doctrine here announced with reference to the right of the court to 
decide the question presented by the appeal must not be confused with the 
doctrine of the finality of the decision of the Collector of Customs upon the 
question of the value of imported merchandise nor with that of the finality of 
his conclusion in immigration cases.<br><br>For the foregoing reasons, the 
judgment of the Court of First Instance is hereby affirmed, with costs. So 
ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Carson, Araullo, Street</em>, and <em>Malcolm, JJ.,</em> 
concur.</p></div>
