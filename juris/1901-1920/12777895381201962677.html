				<h4>
				G.R. No. 11340, November 10, 1917</h4>
				<H3>MELECIO MORALES, ACCOMPANIED BY HIS CURATOR AD LITEM ISIDORO PARAISO, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. ADOLFO MACANDOG, VALERIANA MORALES AND HER HUSBAND, LEOCADIO ARELLANO, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.

				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The evidence of record, read together with the contentions of counsel for the 
appellant in his printed brief, discloses nothing which would justify us in 
disturbing the findings of the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses 
testify, as to the degree of credit which should be accorded the testimony 
submitted on behalf of the plaintiff; and we are unable to say that the findings 
of fact as set forth in the opinion of the trial judge are not supported by a 
preponderance of the evidence of record.
<p>Our conclusions in this regard practically dispose of all the substantial 
contentions of counsel for the appellant; but we may add with relation to the 
alleged irregularities in the appointment of a guardian <em>ad litem</em> for 
the plaintiff, that the judgment being in favor of the plaintiff, we are not 
disposed to hear the defendant to object for the first time to the judgment on 
the ground of such alleged irregularities after it had been rendered against 
him; and perhaps we should further add that the doctrine announced in the case 
of Llacer <em>vs</em>. Munoz de Bustillo and Achaval (12 Phil. Rep., 328) has no 
bearing upon the case at bar, the facts in that case being that the plaintiff 
sought to avoid the consequences of a deed executed by his predecessor in 
interest, while in the case at bar, the plaintiff seeks to recover possession of 
the land in question on the strength of his own title and on the ground that the 
defendant is in possession and claims title by virtue of a deed, fraudulently 
executed in his favor, by one who was not the real owner and who had no 
authority to execute the instrument purporting to convey the land.</p>
<p>The judgment entered in the court below should be and is hereby affirmed, 
with the costs of this instance against the appellant. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Johnson, Araullo, Street</em>, and <em>Malcolm, 
JJ.</em>, concur.</p></div>
