It was sold for&nbsp; and on behalf of the defendant by a Chinese broker to a Chinese&nbsp; lumber merchant and money lender named Rafael Cotauco, for P590, who upon the maturity of defendant's&nbsp; acceptance, presented&nbsp; it to the defendant for&nbsp; payment,&nbsp; and was informed&nbsp; that defendant had no funds, and had made&nbsp; a general assignment in favor of his creditors, some&nbsp; of whom had forced him&nbsp; into liquidation a&nbsp; few&nbsp; days before the acceptance fell due.<br><br>The facts just set&nbsp; out, which&nbsp; in our&nbsp; opinion are fully established by the evidence of record, if unexplained, would leave little room for doubt that the defendant prepared a fictitious commercial&nbsp; instrument for&nbsp; the&nbsp; purpose&nbsp; of&nbsp; deceiving the purchaser to whom&nbsp; he sold&nbsp; it, by giving&nbsp; the instrument the appearance of a draft or bill&nbsp; of exchange drawn&nbsp; in the regular course of business,&nbsp; with a drawer, payee,&nbsp; and indorsers upon whom the purchaser might rely tor payment in the event of the failure of the defendant acceptor so to do; and that the purchaser,&nbsp; deceived by the fictitious quality&nbsp; given the&nbsp; instrument as a&nbsp; commercial document, had suffered by the deception&nbsp; of the defendant to the amount which he paid therefor.<br><br>But we think that there are&nbsp; further facts disclosed by the evidence of record which are sufficient&nbsp; to raise a reasonable&nbsp; doubt not only as to the intent of the defendant to deceive the&nbsp; purchaser of the instrument, but also as to whether the purchaser was in fact deceived,&nbsp; to his loss or detriment, by&nbsp; the peculiar and unusual form in which the instrument was executed.&nbsp; We&nbsp; can not close our&nbsp; eyes to the fact that a most reprehensible practice (we&nbsp; refuse to dignify it by&nbsp; speaking of it as a custom)&nbsp; exists among many&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Chinese merchants of the city of&nbsp; Manila, whereby borrowers,&nbsp; with the full knowledge&nbsp; of the lender, execute just such instruments as the one under consideration, in evidence of loans and advances such as that made by the&nbsp; purchaser&nbsp; of the&nbsp; instrument in&nbsp; the case&nbsp; at bar. What may be&nbsp; the origin of this practice,&nbsp; or what&nbsp; are the objects of the Chinese merchants who adopt it, we do not undertake at this&nbsp; time to determine.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is sufficient for the purposes of this decision to say that the existence of the practice is a matter of general knowledge in&nbsp; this&nbsp; community, and is disclosed&nbsp; by the records&nbsp; of&nbsp; various cases brought to this court, one&nbsp; of&nbsp; which, a civil case, is actually pending at this time; and&nbsp; that while the&nbsp; defendant in the case&nbsp; at bar did&nbsp; not expressly&nbsp; set up or rely&nbsp; upon the existence of the practice&nbsp; in&nbsp; his defense,&nbsp; we&nbsp; are satisfied that&nbsp; the evidence&nbsp; of record raises at&nbsp; least a reasonable doubt&nbsp; as to whether the&nbsp; transaction in question was not had in accordance with this&nbsp; practice with the full knowledge&nbsp; and&nbsp; consent of the&nbsp; complaining witness,&nbsp; the&nbsp; purchaser of the&nbsp; alleged fictitious and fraudulent instrument.<br><br>From the evidence of one&nbsp; of the principal witnesses for the prosecution, it appears that&nbsp; defendant not infrequently prepared and&nbsp; had discounted just such instruments as the one now under consideration,&nbsp; and that&nbsp; on at&nbsp; least one occasion this&nbsp; witness himself discounted such an instrument, with full knowledge of the fact that defendant made use&nbsp; of&nbsp; such instruments for&nbsp; the&nbsp; purpose of borrowing money thereon.&nbsp;&nbsp; And if the other witnesses for the prosecution&nbsp; are to be believed,&nbsp; and&nbsp; we&nbsp; think that&nbsp; the&nbsp; trial judge rightly found&nbsp; that&nbsp; they are,&nbsp; the defendant&nbsp; gave full&nbsp; and particular directions for the preparation of the alleged&nbsp; fraudulent instrument in&nbsp; the presence and within the hearing of various persons who happened to&nbsp; be in his store at the time it was executed, although there&nbsp; was not the slightest necessity for&nbsp; so doing.&nbsp; It would seem that had he been conscious that he was engaged in&nbsp; a fraudulent transaction he&nbsp; would not have thus unnecessarily exposed himself to detection and punishment.<br><br>The conduct of the complaining&nbsp; witness, the purchaser of the instrument, as disclosed by his own testimony, was such as to raise at least a reasonable doubt in our minds as to whether he was or was not&nbsp; aware of the true nature of the instrument which he&nbsp; discounted.&nbsp;&nbsp; He admitted that he bought the draft relying solely on the credit and business reputation of the defendant whose name appeared thereon as acceptor, and that he did not know and made&nbsp; no effort to discover what was the credit or standing of the drawer, payee, and indorsers, or whether any&nbsp; such persons were in existence.&nbsp; He&nbsp; bought the instrument notwithstanding the fact&nbsp; that&nbsp; the signature of the payee does not appear indorsed thereon, and he took it from the Chinese broker who sold&nbsp; it to him, without the broker's indorsement, and&nbsp; relying exclusively, as he says,&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the established&nbsp; credit of the defendant and the assurances of the broker&nbsp; that the defendant would pay it at maturity.&nbsp; Under all the circumstances, and especially in view of&nbsp; the known common practice among Chinese merchants and money lenders to give and&nbsp; receive instruments such&nbsp; as the one in question&nbsp; as evidences&nbsp; of loans and advances, we can&nbsp; not say beyond a reasonable doubt that the complaining witness was in anywise deceived&nbsp; by the form&nbsp; in&nbsp; which the instrument was executed, and indeed we are&nbsp; inclined to believe that he well knew that it was not a draft, as on its face it purported to be, and that it was no more than defendant's promise to pay its face value on maturity of his final acceptance set out therein.<br><br>It not being proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the transaction set out in the information involved any false pretence or deceit on the part of the defendant whereby the complaining witness was defrauded&nbsp; "in the substance, quality, or quantity" of the thing sold to him, defendant's conviction for the crime of&nbsp; estafa can not be sustained. (Art. 534, Penal Code.)<br><br>It may not be improper here to say that this decision in noway places the&nbsp; stamp of our approval on the extremely reprehensible and&nbsp; dangerous practice referred&nbsp; to&nbsp; above, whereby money is borrowed and advanced by Chinese merchants and money lenders in Manila, on evidences of indebtedness cast in the form of drafts with fictitious drawers, payees, and indorsers.&nbsp; The execution, and the disposal or transfer of such fictitious commercial instruments to innocent purchasers&nbsp; for value, without knowledge of their true character,&nbsp; might well expose the parties not merely to the penalties prescribed on conviction of the crime&nbsp; of estafa but also to the much graver penalties prescribed for the crime of falsification&nbsp; of commercial instruments; and it is to be observed also that proof of the true nature&nbsp; of such evidences of&nbsp; indebtedness would&nbsp; in some&nbsp; cases affect the civil rights and obligations of the parties thereto&nbsp; in ways&nbsp; which, it is&nbsp; probable, are wholly unanticipated by those&nbsp; executing and negotiating them, as to which, however, we express no opinion whatever at this time.<br><br>The judgment of conviction and the&nbsp; sentence imposed by the trial court should be&nbsp; reversed, and the defendant acquitted of the crime with which he is charged and his bond exonerated, with the costs of&nbsp; both instances <span style="font-style: italic;">de oficio.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i> Johnson, Moreland,</i> and <i>Elliott, JJ,</i>, concur.<br><i>Arellano, C.
