				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This case was prosecuted to final judgment in accordance with the provisions of the  former Code of Civil Procedure and the appeal was taken and allowed in conformity therewith.  The  parties have agreed in this  court  to  submit themselves to the provisions of the present Code  of Procedure in Civil Actions.</p>
<p>The case having been duly argued and submitted to this court, we find as follows:</p>
<p>First.  That on the fifth day of July, 1887, the partnership of "Guevara Hermanos" was organized as a mixed, general, and limited copartnership by the five heirs under the will of Timotea Andres, who died possessed of certain real estate which became the joint property of the said five heirs and was by them contributed  to the partnership, aggregating a "total value of 47,096 pesos according to the respective deeds, free of all incumbrances, and that part of the said property  mortgaged in favor  of the church  and J. M. Tuason &amp; Co., being valued at 17,155 pesos,  all according to the inventory submitted by  the executor, Laureano   * * *   (Clause 4, record, p. 27.)</p>
<p>Second. That the  manager was vested  with  "special power and authority to dispose, with the advice and consent of the executor of the will of the deceased, Timotea Andre's, of the whole or a part of the partnership property in connection with the operation of the  business,  and not otherwise, and  for this purpose to mortgage or sell the real property of the estate  *   *   *."  (Clause 3, p. 27.)</p>
<p>Third. That in clause 9 provision  is made as  to the duration of the partnership  as follows: "The period of duration of this partnership will be five years, and it shall not be dissolved on account of the death of one or more of its members, nor by the mere will of one or more of them." Clause 10 contains the following provision: "The  provisions of this agreement shall be effective from the date of the death of the deceased, Timotea Andre's, the members of this partnership obligating themselves to discharge the obligations contracted by the former partnership."  (Record, p. 28.)</p>
<p>The former partnership referred to is that  which  was organized by Remigio Guevara and  Jose" Estiarte, the owners of the mercantile establishment known as <em>La Industrial</em>.  That is  to  say, the same  business which  was thereafter continued by the members of the partnership of Guevara Hermanos.</p>
<p>Fourth. That "in Manila according to the minutes (record, p. 44), this second day of June, 1890, at a  meeting held by  the manager of the partnership of  Guevara Hermanos, Quintin Zalvidea, the general partners Laureano Guevara, Jose" Guevara, and  Enrique Navarro,  and the limited  partner, Leandro Ibarra,  in behalf of his wife Carmen  Guevara, it was resolved as follows: That for the purpose of discharging as soon as possible the indebtedness of the establishment <em>La Industrial </em>in favor of J. M. Tuason &amp; Co. the latter be requested to take over all the real property  of the estate  of  the deceased  Timotea  Andres  de Guevara, with the exception of the large stone and brick building, which constitutes a part of the partnership property; any difference between the value of the said real estate and the amount of the indebtedness to be paid to them in cash; and that in case that they do not accept this proposition and  wish  to sell the  real estate in question, that  they  be  empowered to do  so, with our consent,  the proceeds to be applied to the payment  of the debt; that in case  J. M. Tuason &amp; Co. accept  the above proposition and sell the property, if  there still be a balance in their favor, as  we anticipate, everything possible will be done to liquidate this balance,  and for this purpose the manager of the partnership is hereby directed to enter into negotiations with  the said J. M. Tuason &amp;  Co. in pursuance of this resolution.  (Signed)   Quintin  Zalvidea, Laureano Guevara, Leandro Ibarra, Jose Guevara, Enrique Navarro."</p>
<p>Fifth. That on the 3d day of July,  1890, the members of the partnership of Guevara Hermanos, Laureano, Jose Emeterio, Enrique Navarro, Macario and Carmen, the last two accompanied by their  respective  husbands, Quintin Zalvidea, and Leandro Ibarra, agreed  asv follows  in  a notarial  instrument: "That they appoint as manager of the partnership  of 'Guevara Hermanos,' Laureano  Guevara,  who  shall  have the  administration of the business, the use of the firm name, the management of the establishment  belonging to the partnership known as La. Industrial with the same power and authority granted him under the terms of clause 3 of the articles of copartnership  *  *  *. Laureano, on his part, accepts the appointment as manager of the partnership for the purpose  of liquidation."   (Record, p. 30.)</p>
<p>Sixth.  That on the  14th day of December, 1891, Laureano Guevara, as the manager of the  partnership of "Guevara Hermanos" and Gonzalo Tuason, in his capacity as manager of J.  M.  Tuason  &amp; Co.,  entered  into a contract  of liquidation whereby the former assigned to the latter, in payment of the debt aforesaid, all the real estate and the establishment known as <em>La Industrial</em>.  Laureano Guevara agreed as follows:  "That he hereby transfers and assigns to J. M. Tuason  &amp; Co., as payment of 31,564.01 pesos on the  total indebtedness of 54,055.66 pesos due from the partnership of Guevara Hermanos all the real estate referred to in the 8th paragraph of this instrument so that they may dispose of  it as they may see fit; and for this purpose  he also  transfers  to  them all  rights  of action that the partnership of Guevara Hermanos, which he represents, has or may have in relation to said property,  J. M. Tuason &amp; Co., assuming, however, the liability for the payment of the mortgages now existing upon  some of the aforesaid property  in favor of  Obras Pias of the Sagrada Mitra of this archdiocese.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The party .of  the  first part further declares that the aforesaid establishment known  as <em>La Industrial</em>, the printing plant annexed thereto, and the <em>camarin</em> in which the machinery  and printing presses are installed have been sold for the sum of 14,257.03  pesos, which said sum the purchaser will retain and deliver to J. M. Tuason &amp; Co. to be by them applied to the  payment of the total sum of 54,055.66 pesos, which the said Guevara Hermanos owe to J. M. Tuason &amp; Co., and in consideration of the aforesaid amount, the payment of which is  hereby  acknowledged, they transfer  to Hipolito Ocampo y Flores all rights of action which the said Guevara Hermanos have or may have with relation to the establishment <em>La Industrial</em>, stock, fixtures, and appurtenances and the printing plant annexed thereto, together with the machinery, presses, etc., belonging to it, as well as the eatnaHn where the said machinery and  presses are now installed so that the said Ocampo y Flores may dispose of the same as he sees fit and exercise such rights as are inherent in the OAvnership of the same."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gonzalo Tuason, in his aforesaid capacity, and Hipolito de Ocampo declare that they accept the terms of this instrument in so far as it concerns them, the former acknowledging the delivery of the property assigned to the partnership which he represents, and the latter the receipt of the articles and fixtures of the establishment known as La  Industrial as well  as the delivery of the <em>camarin</em> aforesaid. Hipolito do Ocampo pays the purchase price of <em>La Industrial </em>with three promissory notes, the receipt of  which is hereby acknowledged  by Gonzalo  Tuason, who  declares that by the assignment of the  real estate aforesaid, for  the sum of 31,564.01  pesos,  and the promissory notes of  the said Ocampo, aggregating 14,257.03 pesos, the partnership of J. M. Tuason  &amp; Co. acknowledge the payment by Guevara Hermanos of the sum of 45,821.04 pesos on the total indebtedness of 54,055.66 pesos due the said Tuason &amp; Co. (Record, pp. 33-64.)</p>
<p>Seventh.  That  on  the 30th of December, 1891, Laureano Guevara died, as appears from a notarial instrument executed for the purpose  of showing that "the general  partners of the firm of Guevara Hermanos, Jose E.  Guevara, Enrique Navarro, and Eusebia Mendoza, widow of  Guevara, the latter in her own right and in behalf of her minor child, Felicisima  Guevara,  by  her deceased husband,  Laureano  Guevara, during1  their  marriage,  and the  limited partner, Macaria  Guevara,  with the consent of her husband Quintin Zalvidea   *   *   *,  has appointed Jose  E. Guevara as the manager of the business in place of the deceased Laureano Guevara, conferring upon him all the power and authority  which the latter had as such manager, Jose E. Guevara  having accepted the said  appointment" (Record, pp. 7-12.)</p>
<p>Eighth. That on the 27th of January, 1892, the said Jose E. Guevara was appointed  executor  of the  will of his deceased mother Tiinotea Andres.   (Record, pp. 1-6.)</p>
<p>Ninth. That  on the  14th of December,  1895, Jose  E. Guevara questioned  the  validity of the instrument  executed on the 14th of  December, 1891, in a complaint  filed by him in this action.</p>
<p>The purpose  of the action was to  have the said  instrument declared null and void, or otherwise to have the same rescinded, the instrument referred to being the  one  executed by Laureano Guevara as the  manager of  the  firm of Guevara Hermanos assigning the said firm's property  to J. M. Tuason  &amp; Co. in payment of their claim, and in either case to  recover the real estate so assigned to the defendant firm, as well as the establishment and  plant sold to Hipolito de Ocampo.</p>
<p>Tenth.  That on the 22d of December, 1808, the case was decided by the court below dismissing the  complaint with the costs against the plaintiff.  An appeal  was duly  taken from said judgment but it  was not allowed until the 3d of May, 1905, when certain persons, who,  alleging an interest in  the prosecution of the same,  made a motion to the court that the appeal be allowed, to which the appellees did not object.</p>
<p>In  this court the appellant has only insisted upon the nullification of  the said instrument, basing his claim on various grounds, some of which were not urged in the court below.</p>
<p>There are  tAvelve assignments relied upon  by  the appellant.</p>
<p>The fifth assignment, which should  have been the <em>first</em> following the natural  order of things,  is based upon the ground that, "The partnership of Guevara Hermanos, as such, was never vested with title or possession of the property of the estate and could  not transfer the same nor authorise  any person  to do it."   This allegation is contrary to the acts of the plaintiff himself and is in conflict with the evidence according to the <em>first</em> finding above referred to.   In a public instrument the plaintiff, Jose Erneterio Guevara, was one of those who subscribed to the facts set out in the <em>first</em> finding.  Said instrument contains the following  statement: "The undersigned partners being the only heirs under the  will of Timotea Andres  *  *  * contribute to the partnership  *  *  *  the total value of all the property of the estate aggregating a total of 47,096 pesos etc.  It is a well-settled principle of law, recognized by the Spanish authorities, and perfectly applicable to the case at bar, that all property  of  whatsoever nature partners contribute to  a partnership becomes the property of such partnership.   (Judgments of the supreme court of Spain of the 12th of July, 1883, and the 23d of February, 1884.)</p>
<p>Under the second assignment it is  insisted that the partnership of GueVara Hermanos, as such, had no property which it could transfer because, as it is alleged, "the articles of copartnership were  not accompanied by  an inventory of the property as required by law," which  according to the appellant is found in article 1668 of the Civil Code,  and  which according to them  went into effect in these Islands on the 8th of  December, 1889.  This provision of the Civil Code refers to civil copartnerships and is therefore not applicable to  mercantile partnerships, and the said code having gone into effect on the 8th of  December, 1889, could not, under  any circumstances, have any application to a partnership organized on the 6th of July, 1887, even though it were a civil partnership.   Moreover, the last sentence of the fourth clause of the articles of copartnership of'Guevara Hermanos, referred to  in  the <em>first</em> finding, is as follows: "All according to the inventory, submitted by the executor, Laureano, consisting of three pages, which was  exhibited  to the parties (the  notary speaking)   *  *  *, the said inventory remaining in the possession of the manager."</p>
<p>Under the <em>first</em> assignment, which should have been the third, following the natural order of things, it is contended that "the mercantile partnership of Guevara Hermanos, as such, was prohibited by  law from dealing in real estate." The only transactions of this nature consisted  of the contribution of the real estate in question to the capital stock of the partnership of Guevara Hermanos by  those who organized the same,  one of the latter being Jose Emeterio Guevara, and the assignment of this same real estate made by the manager  of the partnership to J. M, Tuason &amp; Co. Such transactions are not prohibited, either by the Code of Commerce of 1829, under the provisions  of which the said partnership was organized, or under the  present code, in accordance with the provisions of which it has continued to exist, or under any law prior  or subsequent to these codes, particularly if the payment, as in the  present case, was made for the purpose of liquidating and winding up the affairs of the partnership.</p>
<p>Under the third and fourth assignments, as set  out in the brief and which should have been the fourth and fifth, following the natural order of things, it is contended that "Laureano Guevara had no power to transfer all the property of Guevara Hermanos and of the estate of Timotea Andres de Guevara, and could not have transferred all the real estate left by the deceased without the consent of the executor."</p>
<p>In the  second and fifth findings as  above set out reference has been made to the <em>special</em> powers of which the manager,  Laureano Guevara, made use.  If  he did not seek the advice and consent of the executor, it was because he himself was such executor, Jose Emeterio Guevara not having succeeded him until after the former's death, to wit, on the 27th of January, 1892.  (8th finding.)  The <em>special</em> power to  dispose of the property  of the partnership had not only been conferred upon him by the members of the partnership in the articles of incorporation, but in a special agreement between them as well.  He  was particularly empowered to  liquidate and wind up  the affairs  of the partnership.  It was just for this purpose that Laureano Guevara was appointed manager of the firm.  "Don Laureano,"  so winds up the instrument executed on the 3d of July, 1890, "on his part, accepts the appointment as manager of the partnership for the purpose of <em>liquidation</em>." (5th finding.)  Jose Emeterio Guevara was one  of those who  had conferred upon him the appointment of manager "witb, the same power and authority granted him under the terms of clause 3 of the articles  of copartnership," which said third clause is quoted in the second finding. Under this clause the  manager was vested with  "special poaver and authority to mortgage or sell the real property of the estate."</p>
<p>The appellant contends that the manager of a partnership  can not select one  particular creditor and transfer to him all of the property and business of a partnership as occurred in this case,  thus nullifying the very object  and purpose of its organization.  But there is no law  or principle prohibiting this and it is natural that such a thing should happen  where there  is only one  creditor  and his claim covers all the assets of the ooncern. There would be some objection to this if such assignment were made to defraud other  creditors.  In  such  case,  however, these creditors would be the only ones who would have a right to bring an action to set  aside such fraudulent act  on the part of the manager, and not the members of the partnership, who themselves were bound by the terms of the articles  of copartnership in favor of the assignee.  Each partner  is bound by the acts of  the manager, whom  he himself was  instrumental in electing for the management of the business, particularly in a case like this where the concern  is a general partnership, and the partner is, like the plaintiff  in this case, a general partner.</p>
<p>Under the sixth and eighth assignments, which should have been the sixth  and seventh,  following  the natural order of things, it is alleged that the partnership of Guevara Hermanos had been completely dissolved long before the 14th of December, 1891, and that the partners could not, by agreement made on the 2d  of June,  1890, have vested Laureano  Guevara with the power  to make an assignment of the property subsequent to  the total dissolution  of the concern.  But assuming all this to be true, yet there would be nothing on which  to base the latter contention, because then for the purpose of the liquidation the manager would have been able  to  do that for which authority was granted him  by the partners  under  that agreement; that is to  say, to wind  Up the affairs of the partnership.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact the appellant can not, without misconstruing the articles of copartnership, contend that the duration of the partnership according to the said articles of  incorporation  would be five years from the death of the deceased Timotea Andres de Guevara.  They could not merge in one the two clauses of the articles of copartnership set out in the third finding.</p>
<p>Assuming  that  their assertion is true and  that such merger is possible, the death of Timotea Andres having occurred  on the 23d of  April, 1886, the five years duration from that date would  expire on the 23d of April, 1891. Consequently the claim that on the 2d of June, 1890, the partners could not  enter  into the agreement  which they made authorizing the manager to assign and transfer the real property of  the partnership  because  the same  had already been dissolved, can not  be sustained.   Moreover, clause 9, in which the duration of the  partnership was expressly stipulated, means that the same having  been organized on the 6th of July, 1887, for a period of five  years, such period should  expire on the 6th  of July, 1892.  We can not consider as existing prior to the  6th of July, 1887, something which did not actually  exist.  The stipulation contained  in the twelfth  clause, to wit,  that  the articles of copartnership would be  considered as  effective from the death  of  the deceased Timotea  Andre's,  was a special stipulation for a special purpose; that  is to say, for the purpose of "discharging the obligations  contracted by the former partnership." The intention was to avoid any legal interruption in the  existence of the partnership  as to the liabilities incurred by <em>La Industrial </em>which were taken over by  the new  firm  of Guevara Herinanos, although as  a matter of fact there was lapse of time between the extinction of the partnership that established <em>La Industrial </em>and the. organization of the firm of Guevara Hermanos.</p>
<p>The eighth, ninth, tenth,  and eleventh assignments taken in the same order in which they appear  in the brief, with the exception of  the seventh, which appears here as  the eighth, referred to the authority contained in  the instrument of the 2d of June, 1890, and  it is alleged by the appellant that there was no real estate to  be  transferred or assigned; that the partnership did not  authorize Laureano Guevara to make an assignment of the property; that the latter transferred and assigned more  property than was necessary;  that the authority to assign could not be for any sum other than  that which  was  "contemplated by  the partners at the said meeting;" and that such authority  did not contemplate the assignment of the said real  property for  any sum less than its  actual value and could not be extended so as to permit the manager  to reduce the  value 25 per cent.  The  agreement in question appears on page 44 of the record.  Reference is made to its contents in  the fourth  finding herein.  This agreement was undoubtedly the basis of the deed of transfer or assignment in payment and it  was an express authority to the manager to pay what the partnership owed J. M. Tuason &amp; Co.  That autliority was conferred by the  partners upon Quintin Zalvidea, at that time manager of  the firm, who attended the meeting and was one of those who adopted such resolution. Thereafter, and on the 3d of July  of the same year Zalvidea was succeeded by Laureano Guevara, with the same autliority conferred upon the former, at another meeting of the partners (5th finding), who expressly authorized the manager to propose to J. M. Tuason &amp; Co. that the latter take over all the  real property of  the estate, or sell the same, and keep the proceeds; the manager being authorized to enter into negotiations for this purpose  with the said Tuason &amp; Co., the partnership  to pay to the said  Tuason &amp; Co. any balance there might be between the value of the said property  and the amount of the  indebtedness as the said J. M. Tuason &amp; Co. might decide.   We fail to see that the partners had in contemplation any particular sum, and we do not find any limitation in the powers conferred upon the manager.  It is very evident that the purpose was to  wind up the affairs of the partnership and to pay all  its debts with  the proceeds of the real  property and other funds thereof, and if there should be any balance still due to pay that balance, the partners having anticipated that the value of the  property  at that time  would not be sufficient to pay the whole indebtedness.</p>
<p>Under the twelfth assignment it is alleged that  the appellant,  Macaria Guevara, the  wife and now the  widow of Quintin Zalvidea, and Carmen Guevara,  the wife and now the widow of Leandro Ibarra, were not parties to the agreement of the 2d of June, 1890, and therefore did not authorize Laureano Guevara to execute the deed which they now contest, but the general partners could not have permitted Quintin Zalvidea and Leandro Ibarra to take any part in  the agreement of the 2d of June,  1890,  in any capacity other than as husbands and legal  representatives of their  respective wives, Macaria and Carmen, the limited partners, the said Leandro Ibarra having been considered in the said agreement as a limited partner in behalf and as a representative of his wife.  One thing is certain that the husband, as such, can not administer the separate property of liis wife, and another thing is that he is and should  be her legal  representative even with  relation to such property.  Moreover the said Macaria and  Carmen took part in the execution of»the deed of  the 1st of July following wherein Laureano was appointed manager, the latter having accepted the appointment expressly for the purpose of winding up the affairs of the partnership.   Laureano was vested by all the partners without exception with the same powers as his predecessor, Quintin, and in clause 3 of the articles  of copartnership he was expressly authorized  to dispose of the partnership  property.</p>
<p>According to the settled jurisprudence of the supreme court of justice of Spain and the express provisions of the old Code of Civil Procedure under  which this action was prosecuted and decided, the parties were required to set out in their pleadings the issues of  fact and law which they desired to submit to the determination of the court, and if any provisions  of law were subsequently  invoked  which could not be considered because they  had not been set out in the pleadings the court disregarded the same and the appellant was not permitted to base his appeal upon the alleged violation of such provisions.  Consequently the exceptions and  defenses not set  out in  the  pleadings can not now be taken into consideration even though the laws and doctrines applicable thereto  were violated by the trial court.  Such violations could not be the base  of a writ  of error.  (Judgments of the 16th  of  November, 1861; 13th of June, 1863; 31st of December, 1864, and 8th of June, 1866.)</p>
<p>None of the facts and provisions of law upon which  is based the  subsidiary prayer of the complaint relating  to the rescission of the contract in the manner in which they were set out in the <em>replica</em> have been urged as a ground for the reversal of the judgment  of the court below.</p>
<p>And of  the facts and provisions of law upon which the prayer that the  said  contract be declared null and void is based only two have been urged, to wit, that the manager acted without the advice and consent of the executor and that the duration of the partnership of Guevara Hermanos was counted from the date of the death of Timotea Andres de Guevara.</p>
<p>This last exception  or defense is set up  in the <em>replica</em> and not in the complaint in order to support the contention that  when Laureano  Guevara  executed the instrument dated  December 14, 1.891,  the  partnership had  already ceased to exist and consequently  there could be no manager who might validly make the  assignment of the property herein sought to be annulled.</p>
<p>If this were so, then the plaintiff, Jose Emeterio Guevara, could not  have  been the manager and liquidator of the firm on December 31, 1891, and if Laureano Guevara could not on December 14, 181)1, legally represent a partnership which,  according to the plaintiff, had ceased to exist on the 23d of April, 1891, much less could he represent it on the 31st of December of the same year.</p>
<p>What seems more evident, although the court is of the opinion  that it  is not necessary to decide this question which has  been raised in both instances, is that the whole management and partnership had ceased to exist after the 14th of December, 1891, on account of the absolute disappearance of the capital.   (Art.  329 of the  Code of Commerce of 1829.)</p>
<p>After considering, however, all the questions raised on this appeal in the form of assignments of error, this court is of the opinion that no legal cause has been  shown why the instrument executed on the  14th of December, 1891, should be declared void and consequently there is no reason why the judgment of the court below should be reversed.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from  is accordingly hereby affirmed in all respects with the costs against the appellant. After the expiration of twenty days let judgment be entered in accordance herewith and ten  days thereafter the case be remanded to the court below for execution.  So ordered.</p>
