				G.R. No. 1185, April 04, 1903</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE, VS. VENTURA BETIONG, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>LADD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The complaint charges the defendant with the offense in aiding and abetting a band of brigands by supplying them with food. (Act No, 158, sec. 4) Upon being arraigned in the Court of First Instance, the defendant, who had no cousel, having electedto defend himself, stated that the facts charged in the complaint were true, by that he supplied the brigands with food through fear that if he did not do so they would kill him.  Without hearing any evidence, the court thereupon found the defendant guilty, and sentenced him to ten years' imprisonment</p>
<p>What the defendant stated when arraigned amounted to a denial of criminal responsibility, based on facts which, he conceived, constituted a lawful excuse for his conduct. It was virtually a plea of not guilty. (See United States vs. Padilla, decided November 18,  1902.)   It  is quite apparent that the court regarded it as a plea of guilty,  and for this error the cause must be sent back for a new trial.</p>
<p>The place where the alleged crime was committed is not stated  in the complaint.   This  defect should  be supplied by amendment.</p>
<p>The judgment of  the court  below will be reversed  and the cause returned  to that  court for proceedings in conformity with this opinion.   So ordered.</p>
<p> <em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Cooper, Willard,</em> and <em>Mapa, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em>McDonough, J.,</em> did not sit  in this case.</p>
