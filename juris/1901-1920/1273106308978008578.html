				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Maria Salud Flores applied to the Court of&nbsp; Land Registration for the registration of&nbsp; two parcels of land situated in Antipolo, Province of&nbsp; Rizal,&nbsp; and her application received favorable action, as the adjudication and registration&nbsp; of the property was decreed on May 15,&nbsp; 1908.<br><br>But subsequently, on July 13 of the same year, Mariano Limjap petitioned for a revision of&nbsp; the proceedings had in connection with one of the said parcels and a new hearing was granted.<br><br>At&nbsp; this new hearing the applicant recognized the right of the opponent, Mariano Limjap, to the portion of land which was the subject of the opposition and the revision.<br><br>The land adjudicated to Maria Salud Flores, concerned in Limjap's opposition, is that situated in Samboanga, municipality of Antipolo, Province of&nbsp; Rizal, with&nbsp; an area&nbsp; of 20,081.96 square meters, the boundaries of which are&nbsp; set forth&nbsp; in&nbsp; the application and are herein taken for granted, since&nbsp; the identity of the property, which is also admitted, was agreed upon.&nbsp; This land that is the subject of Limjap's opposition contains 437 square meters and 50 square decimeters and&nbsp; was acquired at a public&nbsp; auction held by the provincial treasurer of Rizal on July 22, 1904.<br><br>The Court of Land Registration, in&nbsp; view of the acquiescence of&nbsp; the applicant, Maria&nbsp; Salud&nbsp; Flores, decreed,&nbsp; on June&nbsp; 30, 1908, the adjudication and registration of the parcel of land claimed&nbsp; by&nbsp; Mariano Limjap and his wife, Maria Escolar.&nbsp; Some time afterwards, Limjap conveyed his&nbsp; right in the said piece of land to Cayetano Arguelles.<br><br>The plan of the said Samboanga land having been&nbsp; drawn by&nbsp; the Bureau&nbsp; of&nbsp; Lands, the applicant&nbsp; signified her&nbsp; acceptance.<br><br>The facts&nbsp; thus far,&nbsp; which give rise to no discussion whatever and&nbsp; are&nbsp; stated as&nbsp; antecedents&nbsp; of&nbsp; those&nbsp; which constitute the subject matter of the present appeal, are:<br><ol><li>The applicant, in&nbsp; order&nbsp; to distinguish and separate the parcel of&nbsp; land corresponding to&nbsp; Limjap, presented a plan,&nbsp; in&nbsp; agreement with that&nbsp; drawn by the&nbsp; Bureau&nbsp; of Lands and signed only by herself, in which the&nbsp; said parcel is demarcated, with an area of 437.50 square meters, and the remainder, pertaining to the applicant, 18,706.50 square meters.<br><br></li><li>On August 28, 1909, the Court of Land Registration issued the following order:<br><blockquote>"Whereas, in the plan subscribed by the applicant, Maria Salud&nbsp; Flores, on the 26th of May last,&nbsp; and which is an exact copy of that drawn by the Bureau of Lands, specification is made of the portion of land adjudicated to Mariano Limjap y Nolasco,&nbsp; by a transaction entered into between the latter and the said applicant, which&nbsp; portion has been conveyed to Mr. Cayetano Arguelles y Fernandez&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; * let&nbsp; a decree be entered in favor of&nbsp; the aforementioned Arguelles for the said&nbsp; portion of land referred to&nbsp; in the technical description subscribed by the&nbsp; applicant,&nbsp; Maria Salud Flores, and by Mariano Limjap."</blockquote></li><li>A surveyor of the Court of Land Registration represented to the latter that the said plan was signed by a person&nbsp; not authorized by the provisions&nbsp; of Act No. 1937 to sign plans, and that it should be returned to the applicant with the requirement that&nbsp; she present a new plan duly approved by the Bureau of Lands.<br><br></li><li>The clerk of the Court of Land Registration also called the attention of the applicant to the incorrectness&nbsp; of the statement of the area of each one&nbsp; of the two parcels of land, and suggested to her the necessity of filing an amended application, without&nbsp; which the decree of registration could not be issued.&nbsp; Both the applicant and Cayetano Arguelles filed the new application, rectifying the area of each parcel of land in the following manner: That of Arguelles's land was given as&nbsp; 435.^3 square meters, instead of 487.50 square meters;&nbsp; and&nbsp; that of Maria&nbsp; Salud&nbsp; Flores's, as&nbsp; 18,708.47 square meters, instead of 18,706.50 square meters.<br><br></li><li>On February 26, 1910, the Court of Land Registration, in harmony&nbsp; with the&nbsp; representation made by&nbsp; one&nbsp; of&nbsp; its surveyors, and contained in fact No. 3 above, made a ruling wherein it ordered that the plan referred to be admitted.<br><br></li><li>On March&nbsp; 17,&nbsp; 1910, the Attorney-General protested against and toolran exception to the said ruling, and prayed for its reconsideration on the ground that it was contrary to the provisions of Acts Nos.&nbsp; 1875 and 1937, and announced, moreover, that, in case his&nbsp; motion to reconsider was denied, he likewise would take exception thereto.<br><br></li><li>The Court of Land Registration, on March 22, 1910, ruled upon the said&nbsp; motion for&nbsp; reconsideration, denying the same and admitting the exceptions taken to both rulings. In this manner the question was submitted on appeal.</li></ol>Is it necessary that a plan, exactly copied from one drawn by the Bureau of Lands, in which a&nbsp; parcel of land is demarcated which must be segregated therefrom as belonging to an opponent or some other person&nbsp; not the applicant, be signed by a surveyor authorized to exercise his profession, and that it be again approved by the said&nbsp; Bureau?<br><br>Arguments for&nbsp; the contrary opinion are: (1) That, in the case of# Maria Guia Garcia, No. 5399, it&nbsp; was decided that,&nbsp; when the&nbsp; original plan has been&nbsp; approved&nbsp; by the Bureau of&nbsp; Lands, as in the case under examination, it is not necessary to require that the plan of the segregated portion be&nbsp; again approved by the Bureau&nbsp; aforementioned, inasmuch as the surveyors of the Court of Land Registration&nbsp; likewise have the technical and&nbsp; other knowledge required of those of that Bureau and the necessary ability to fudge whether the segregation made of a piece of land on a plan already approved by the Bureau&nbsp; of Lands is or is not correct;&nbsp; (2) that,&nbsp; even when the plans have been approved by the Bureau of Lands, the surveyors of the Court of Land Registration&nbsp; are&nbsp; not exempt from the duty of examining&nbsp; them before they are&nbsp; published or before the titles are decreed; and (3) that the&nbsp; procedure of a new approval by the Bureau of Lands, in the cases of the segregation of any portion of&nbsp; a&nbsp; parcel or tract of land,&nbsp; the plan of which has already been examined and approved by the said Bureau, would only mean an unnecessary repetition of labor.<br><br>The following arguments support an affirmative decision of the preceding question: (1)&nbsp; That there is no comparison between the case of Maria&nbsp; Guia Garcia and the present one, since, in the former, the applicant sold a portion of her property after it had been registered, while, in the present case, the property&nbsp; has&nbsp; not yet been&nbsp; registered and&nbsp; the segregation of a part of the same was not&nbsp; effected by any act&nbsp; of the applicant, but through a decree of the Court of Land Registration issued as a result of a&nbsp; revision&nbsp; obtained by the&nbsp; real owner of the&nbsp; land&nbsp; before the decision became final;&nbsp; (2) that,&nbsp; were the said plan admitted,&nbsp; the adjudication would&nbsp; have to be made in accord with&nbsp; the measurements&nbsp; and other data given in the plan, relative to the segregated&nbsp; portion, although the area given&nbsp; in&nbsp; the said plan, both to the lesser&nbsp; and to the&nbsp; greater parcel, was found to be inexact and incorrect, and, moreover,&nbsp; the said plan is signed by the&nbsp; applicant herself, who&nbsp; is&nbsp; not even a private surveyor,&nbsp; and no value can be attached to the&nbsp; allegation&nbsp; that it&nbsp; is&nbsp; a copy of an original, approved plan, because this original does not&nbsp; contain&nbsp; the portion segregated in that copy;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; that the boundaries of&nbsp; the segregated portion were established by&nbsp; an unauthorized person, and&nbsp; hence the inexactness&nbsp; in area; and, finally, that, it being the duty of the surveyors of the Court&nbsp; of Land Registration, as it&nbsp; is in&nbsp; fact, to examine the plans submitted to the court, it was a surveyor of the court who complied with&nbsp; his duty in examining the plan and it&nbsp; was he who proposed the rejection of the measurements therein established by&nbsp; one who&nbsp; was not a surveyor, pursuant&nbsp; to the conditions required in section 5 of Act No. 1937.<br><br>Since these provisions of the law must be observed, the order appealed from is reversed,&nbsp; and the&nbsp; Court of Land Registration&nbsp; shall&nbsp; require the&nbsp; filing of another plan prepared in conformity with the provisions of Act No. 1937. So ordered.<br><br><i>Torres,&nbsp; Johnson, Moreland,</i> and <i>Trent, JJ.</i>, concur.<br></div>
