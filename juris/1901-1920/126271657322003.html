				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE, VS. F. W. WEBSTER, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>TRACEY, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The defendant was forage master, having charge of Government forage in the corral in  Manila and in the hay yard at Pandacan,  subject to  the orders  of the quarter-master, who was directly responsible to the United States Government therefor and without whose order  no forage could be issued.  Upon requisition forwarded by the division quartermaster he issued his orders to the forage master and a dray slip corresponding with it was delivered to the teamster to serve  both as his authority to pass the gate and, when signed,  as a receipt by  the person to  whom  the forage was  to  be  delivered.  The forage  master had no authority to receive money from  sales or to make any issues except on orders from the, quartermaster's office.</p>
<p>Without orders from the quartermaster or other authority, and upon dray slips made out by himself, the defendant sent out of the corral 186 bales of hay and 138 sacks of oats, of the value of 2,015 pesos, to be delivered to livery stables  and individuals,  for which the Government  received no pay.</p>
<p>The qualified charge of this forage, subject to the orders of a superior, who alone was responsible  to the Government for it, without the right on  the part of the accused to sell it or to part with the physical custody of it unless on written orders,  was not such a possession as  to render the abstraction of the property by him malversation  instead of theft.</p>
<p>In the month preceding the complaint in this case, the accused, on his plea of guilty, had been sentenced to nine months' imprisonment (<em>prision  correctional </em>and <em>prision subsidiaria</em>)  for the theft of 65 bales of hay and 28 sacks of oats of the value of 530 pesos.  From the evidence it is clear that the greater  part of  the  hay and  oats did not enter into the quantity for the theft of which he was tried herein, for the reason that the deliveries of the two amounts were proved by  Government  witnesses, to have been made to different persons and at different places;  as to some portion  of it, however, there was no such proof. The defendant on his part did not prove the identity  of any part of the forage in the two cases nor any connection between them in point of time, place, persons, or plan.  The burden of this defense rested upon him and he has failed to establish it.</p>
<p>It is claimed by the accused that oral evidence of the identity of the two offenses was erroneously excluded  by the judge.   The record reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Question (by defendant's counsel).  I  will ask you if your  testimony  in that case and the facts testified to  by you are not the facts about which you have just testified?</p>
  <p>"(Objected to as calling for the opinion and conclusion of the witness and as immaterial.)</p>
  <p>"COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENDANT. I have a plea in this case of former conviction  for the same offense charged in this complaint  and  I propose later to introduce  the entire record in the case I am alluding to.</p>
  <p>"The Court. I think the record  would be the best evidence.  The objection is sustained."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similar questions to other witnesses were ruled out on the same ground.v When the record of the previous conviction  was produced it appeared that the accused having pleaded guilty there  was no evidence whatever, and the papers  contained nothing  by  which the offense could  be identified as to its particulars.  In order to avail himself of his exception  it was incumbent upon  counsel for the accused, either at the time  of the original ruling excluding the evidence to have enlightened the judge as to the contents  of this record,  or else after  the production of the record to have had the witnesses recalled and the question put to  them anew.  The judge was evidently misled by the promise  of counsel to  produce the record, unaware that it  contained no  evidence or specifications.</p>
<p>We do not now pass on the objection that the question called for a  conclusion rather than a fact.</p>
<p>The defendant was  convicted  and sentenced to  the penalty of five years' imprisonment,  with hard labor, and the costs.</p>
<p>The judgment is affirmed with  this modification, that the accused  is  condemned  to the penalty of four  years nine months and ten days' imprisonment (<em>presidio correctional</em>) and  the payment to the Government of the  value of the property stolen, to  wit,  2,015 pesos,  and in case of insolvency to suffer corresponding subsidiary imprisonment,  not  to  exceed one year, and also to pay  the costs of this appeal.  After the expiration of ten days judgment shall be entered in accordance herewith and ten days  thereafter  the case will  be remanded  to the court below for execution thereof.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Carson,</em> and <em>Willard, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
