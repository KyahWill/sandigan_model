				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE, VS. BRAULIO ALMASAN (ALIAS PABLO PIANGA), DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The defendant in this case was charged with the crime of robbery,
tried by the Court of First Instance of the Province of Pangasinan on
the 13th day of November, 1903, sentenced to be imprisoned for a period
of five years of <em>presidio correccional</em>, and to indemnify the
persons from whom the money was stolen in the sum of 930 pesos,
Mexican, or to return the jewelry and money stolen to the offended
party.<p></p>
<p>The evidence shows that the defendant, together with four more
persons, did, in the month of October, 1903, enter the house of one
Bartolomea Oclarino, in the pueblo of Salasa, and then and there, by
force and violence, take and carry away the sum of 700 pesos, Mexican,
four golden rosaries, four pairs of golden earrings, one golden cross,
one golden chain with a medal, two umbrellas, two hats, one suit of
men's clothing, and one blanket, all the property of the owner of said
house.</p>
<p>The defendant here was the only one of the persons who entered the
house on said night who was identified by any of the persons who were
robbed. The defendant was arrested and taken into the custody of the
law on the night of the robbery.</p>
<p>The foregoing facts were supported by the testimony of several witnesses.</p>
<p>The evidence is sufficient to support the sentence of the court
below, and it is therefore affirmed, with the costs in both instances.
So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa,</em> and <em>Carson, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
