				<h4>
				G.R. No. 1302, August 21, 1903</h4>
				<H3>THE  UNITED STATES,  COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE,  VS. NARCISO CALIGAGAN, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.: </STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>It is claimed by the counsel  for the defendant in this court that  the statements made in the preliminary investigation were  improperly considered  by the court  below, citing in support of his claim decisions of this court.  Testimony given in the preliminary hearing can never be considered by  the Court of First Instance when the accused is there on trial  unless it is  reproduced in that courtâ€”that is, unless there is proof in that court of  what was  the testimony before the justice of the peace. </p>
<p>When there is  such proof, the effect to be given to  the testimony before the justice of the  peace depends  upon the person who gave it.  If such person was the defendant, his  statement  has, at least, the effect  of any extrajudicial confession made hv him and ,is evidence proper to be taken into consideration against him,  although  he may have in the Court of First Instance retracted his confession.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the person were not the defendant, his testimony before the justice can never be used to convict tlie defendant   If such a iierson testified before the justice thai he saw  the defendant commit the act, and in the Court of First Instance testifies that he did not, his first statement can not avail the  Government.   If, however, he testified before the justice that he did not see the defendant commit the act, and  in the Court of First Instance testifies that he  did, the  defendant can there prove what his  testimony was before the justice, for the purpose of impeaching his credibility as a witness. </p>
<p>In the case at bar the Government proved at the trial in the Court of First. Instance that the defendant made certain statements before the  justice in the preliminary investigation.  Those'statements the Court of First  Instance had  a  right to consider in deciding upon the guilt or innocence  of the accused.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the witness Pangan before the justice testified  that the deceased Capulong, before he died, told him that the defendant had wounded him.  But at the trial in the Court of First Instance he testified that the deceased said nothing to him at the time.   His first statement can not be used as evidence against the defendant.</p>
<p>Upon  all the evidence that is proper to be considered, we think that the guilt of the defendant is proved but that he is entitled to the benefit of the attenuating circumstance of drunkenness.</p>
<p>The  judgment  is  affirmed, with  costs of this  instance against the appellant.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Cooper, Mapa,</em> and  <em>McDonough, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
