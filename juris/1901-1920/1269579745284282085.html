				G.R. No. 9677, December 15, 1914</h4>
				<H3>IN RE ESTATE OF TOMASA NEPOMUCENO, DECEASED, SANTOS CARTAGENA, PETITIONER AND APPELLEE, VS. ISAIAS LIJAUCO AND ESPERANZA ZAVALLA, OPPONENTS AND APPELLANTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>MORELAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Laguna 
admitting a will to probate and dismissing the opposition thereto.
<p>It appears that Tomasa Nepomuceno executed a will on the 3d day of March, 
1913, but her attorney having been informed that the will was signed by herself 
when only two of the three attesting witnesses were present, he advised her that 
the will be reexecuted and that the testatrix sign the will in the presence of 
all three attesting witnesses. Accordingly, on the day following, the will was 
reexecuted and all of the formalities required by law were observed.</p>
<p>It is contended on the part of the appellants that the will was not executed 
in the manner required by law and that the testimony of the attesting witnesses 
was not sufficiently uniform to demonstrate that all of the formalities required 
by law had been complied with.</p>
<p>We are unable to agree with this contention. It appears clear from the 
testimony of the attesting witnesses that the testatrix signed the will in their 
presence and that, at her request, each one of the witnesses in the presence of 
the testatrix and of the other two attesting witnesses signed the will. This is 
all that the law requires and while there may be some hesitation in the 
testimony of some of the witnesses, we are satisfied that the evidence, such as 
it is, taken in connection with the attesting clause attached to the will, which 
was made and signed at the time the will was executed and which carries with it 
the presumption of correctness, is sufficient to sustain the finding of the 
trial court that the will was properly executed and should be probated.</p>
<p>It is contended on this appeal that it is not an essential requisite of a 
will that the testator sign it in the presence of the three attesting witnesses. 
We are of the opinion that this contention is not sound. While the first part of 
section 618 of the Code of Civil Procedure does not expressly require that the 
testator sign the will in the presence of the attesting witnesses, the second 
part thereof does require that fact to appear in the attestation clause and this 
court has always held that such a requisite is essential to the due execution of 
the will. The second part of section 618 provides that "the attestation shall 
state the fact that the testator signed the will, or caused it to be signed by 
some other person, at his express direction, in the presence of three witnesses, 
and that they attested and subscribed it in his presence and in the presence of 
each other."</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the 
appellants.</p>
