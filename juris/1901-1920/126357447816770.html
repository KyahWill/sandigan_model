				<H3>BRYAN, LANDON CO., PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. THE AMERICAN BANK ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The  complaint, all of the allegations of which were admitted by the answer, states in substance that on the 19th day of April, 1905, the plaintiff purchased from the American Bank a document of which the following is a copy: "$4,000.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="right"> "AMERICAN  BANK,</p>
  <p align="right">"Manila, P. I., <em>April 19,1905.</em></p>
  <p>"Pay to the order  of K. 11.  Landon  Four Thousand Dollars.</p>
  <p>"To First National Bank, San Francisco.</p>
  <p align="right"> "IT.  B.  MULFORD, <em>Cashier</em>.</p>
  <p>"No. 291."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That on the 19th day of April, 1905, the plaintiff paid 
for this document $4,000, United States currency; that on the 18th'of May, 1905, the American Bank was closed by the order of the Government and the defendant  Branagan, the Insular Treasurer,  was appointed its  receiver for the purpose of settling its affairs and paying its creditors;  that on the  2tith of May,  1905, the above document or check was duly presented for payment to the First National Bank of San Francisco, which payment was refused and  the check  duly  protested  for nonpayment; that between  the 19th day of April,  1905, and  the  26th day  of May, 1905,  including that day, the San Francisco bank had in its possession funds belonging to the American Bank more than sufficient to pay the draft,  and that after the 26th day of May said funds were transmitted to the defendant Branagan, as receiver aforesaid, and were at the time the action  was commenced in his possession.</p>
<p>The theory of the plaintiff is that the purchase of this check on the 19th day of April, 1905, operated as an equitable assignment  of so much money then in the hands  of the San Francisco bank to the credit of the American Bank.   The court below rejected this theory and held that the plaintiff stood as a general creditor of the bank and was not entitled to any preference in the distribution of its assets.  Against a judgment entered  to this effect the plaintiff has appealed.</p>
<p>The question presented by the appeal  is whether a check like the one in  question operated as an equitable assignment of so much money in  the hands of  the San Francisco bank, which equitable assignment could be enforced by the plaintiff against the American Bank and its receiver and other creditors.</p>
<p>The decisions of the Supreme Court of the  United States are, of course, binding upon this court.  That that court has passed upon this question adversely to  the appellant is demonstrated by an examination of its decisions. In the case of Ladede Bank <em>vs</em>. Schuler (120 U. S., 511) the court said, at page 515:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Apart from this matter, it is not easy to see any valid reason win7 the assignment of an insolvent debtor, for the equal benefit of all his creditors,  and all his property, does not confer on those creditors an equity equal to that of the holder of an unpaid check upon his banker.   The holder of this check comes into the distribution of the funds in the hands of the assignee for his share of those funds with other creditors.   The mere  fact that  he had received  a. check, a few days before the making of the assignment, on the bank,  which had not  been presented until  after the general assignment  was made and the  bank  notified, does not seem,  in and of itself, to give any  such superiority or  right.   The assignment was complete  and perfect,  and vested in the assignee the right to all the property of the assignor immediately upon its execution and delivery, with due formalities,  to the assignee,  and  the  check  of  this assignee, like the check of Israel &amp; Co.,  could  have been paid by the bank with safety, if first presented.  The check given  by the same assignor a few days  before  was only an  acknowledgment  of a debt by that assignor, and  became no  valid claim upon the funds against which  it was drawn until the holder of those funds was notified of its existence. This, we think, is the fair result of the authorities on that subject."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the case of Florence Mining  Co. <em>vs</em>. Brown (124 U. 8., 385)  the court said, at page 301:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"An order to pay a particular sum out of a special fund can not be treated as an equitable assignment  <em>pro tanto</em> unless accompanied with such a relinquishment  of control over the sum designated that the fund holder can safely pay it, and be compelled to do so, though forbidden by the drawer.  A general deposit in a bank is so much money to the depositor's credit; it is a debt to him by the bank, payable on demand to his order, not property capable of identification and specific appropriation.  A check  upon the bank in the usual form,  not  accepted or certified by its cashier to be good, does not constitute a transfer of any money to the credit of  the holder; it  is  simply an order which may be countermanded, and payment forbidden by the drawer  at any time before it is actually  cashed.  It creates no lien on the money, which the holder  can enforce against  the  bank.  It does not  of  itself  operate as an equitable assignment."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the case of the Fourth Street Bank <em>vs</em>. Yardley (165 U. S., 034) the court said, at page 643:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"It is  also settled that  a check, drawn in the ordinary form, does not, as between the  maker and payee, constitute an equitable assignment pro tmito of an  indebtedness owing by the bank  upon which the check has been drawn, and that the mere giving and receipt of the check does not entitle the holder to priority  over general  creditors in a fund received from  such bank  by an assignee under a general assignment made  by the debtor for the benefit of his creditors.  (Florence Mining Company <em>vs</em>. Brown, 124 U. S., 385; Laclede Bank <em>vs</em>. Schuler, 120 U. S., 511.)"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this last case it is true that the court found from all the circumstances that there had been an equitable assignment in  favor of the Fourth  Street Bank of  the money in the hands of the New York Bank on  which the check then in question was drawn,  but this  holding was based expressly upon the  unusual   and extraordinary circumstances in that particular case and upon  the fact that in addition  to the execution and delivery of the check by the Keystone Bank, there was a  contract  made between the Keystone Bank and the Fourth Street Bank at  the time of such delivery, the effect of which, as the court held, was to assign the funds in the hands of the New York Bank to the Fourth Street Bank.  In the case at bar nothing of that kind appears.  The only allegations are that the check was bought  and paid  for.  There is  no allegation that there was any other contract or agreement between the American Bank and the plaintiff  other than  that indicated  by the check.</p>
<p>These decisions  of the Supreme  Court  of  the United States  are not based, as seems to have been suggested in the argument, upon the provisions of the National  Banking Act,  but upon the general principles of commercial law applicable to such transactions.</p>
<p>The judgment of the court below is affirmed,  with the costs of this instance against the  appellant.  After the expiration of twenty days let judgment be entered in accordance herewith and  ten days thereafter the record remanded to the court from  whence it  came for proper  action.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J.,  Torres, Mapa,  Carson,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
