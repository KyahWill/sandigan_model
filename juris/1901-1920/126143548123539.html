    <em>"Court of First Instance, City of Manila, P. I."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After hearing the evidence adduced during the trial in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila the judge of that court found the defendant guilty and sentenced' him to be imprisoned for twelve years and one day and to pay the  costs.   From this decision the defendant appealed to this court  An  examination of  the evidence adduced during the trial in the inferior court shows beyond peradventure of doubt that the defendant was guilty of the crime charged in said complaint, in the  manner  and form  as charged therein.</p>
<p>The court having sentenced the defendant in cases Kos. 2600,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 2601,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and 2602<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> to the penalty prescribed by law in each case, which penalties amount together to forty years' imprisonment, and by reason of the  fact that the penalties imposed on one defendant can not exceed forty years under the  provisions of paragraph 2,  article  88  of the  Penal  Code, this case  is hereby dismissed, with the costs de oficio.  So ordered.</p>

<em>DISSENTING</em></div>
<p><strong>CARSON, J.:</strong></p>
<p>I dissent.  There is no authority in law for the dismissal of this case.</p>
<p>The provisions of paragraph 2, article  88  of the Penal Code, limit the maximum duration of the penalties which may be imposed on one convicted of various offenses  to forty years, but this does not relieve the court of the duty of imposing these penalties prescribed by law which are not  affected by this provision. The restitution of money or property unlawfully acquired, the payment of  civil damages to the person injured, the payment of costs and the imposition of the appropriate  accessory penalties prescribed in  section 3, Chapter III, title 3, Book I of the code, are logical and necessary consequences of ttfe court's finding that the accused  is guilty of the crime with which he is charged.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the judgment and sentence in cases Nos. 2600, 2601, and 2602, referred to  in the majority opinion, have not become final, and may  be  reversed on appeal. The  point may not be of much practical importance in this case, but cases sometimes arise in which the precedent, if followed, would defeat the ends of justice.   For example: A. is charged in three separate complaints with the crimes of arson, assassination, and robbery,  respectively; he is found guilty in all three causes, and  the Court of First Instance imposes terms of imprisonment aggregating forty years in the first two, and  following the precedent established in this case dismisses the  complaint for robbery. On appeal the judgment and sentence for arson and assassination are reversed  for some error in procedure, or for lack of proof which shows the guilt of  the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.  In such event the  accused would then go free although it may be that  without error in the proceedings he had been proven  guilty  beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of robbery, because the dismissal of the complaint after trial is a bar to further proceedings.</p>
The court should pronounce the sentence which the law prescribes, issuing an order at the same time that so much of the sentence  imposing imprisonment as would subject the convict to imprisonment for a period of more than forty years is not to be executed.<br>
