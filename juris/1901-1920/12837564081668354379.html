				G.R. No. 11179, March 14, 1917</h4>
				<H3>THE BANK OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. AGUSTIN BELZUNCE, ADMINISTRATOR OF THE ESTATE OF RUPERTO BULZUNCE, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.

				<BR><STRONG>MORELAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of the Tenth 
Judicial District in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of P50,000, "with 
interest thereon at the rate of 9 per cent per annum from the 22d day of January 
1913, said interest to be compounded quarterly as agreed between the parties 
until the final payment is made."
<p>The only question raised on this appeal is the jurisdiction of the Court of 
First Instance, it being urged that, inasmuch as it appears from the complaint 
that the claim which is the foundation of the judgment was against a deceased 
person, it was the duty of the plaintiff to show affirmatively on the trial the 
facts necessary to give the Court that the claim had been duly presented to the 
commissioners appointed to hear claims against the estate of the deceased, the 
rejection by them of the claim, and an appeal taken from that rejection to the 
Court of First Instance in the manner provided by law. It is contended that the 
record does not show those preliminary facts and therefore that the Court of 
First Instance had no jurisdiction to render the judgment appealed from.</p>
<p>We are of the opinion that the contention of the appellant is not well 
founded. The jurisdiction of Courts of First Instance is presumed in the absence 
of evidence clearly showing the contrary; and in cases of this character, every 
step necessary to confer jurisdiction on that court will be presumed to have 
been taken int he absence of evidence to the contrary.</p>
<p>We do not undertake to decide at this time, the question not having been 
presented or discussed, whether it is necessary that all of the steps indicated 
by the appellant as essential to confer jurisdiction on the Court of First 
Instance in cases of this character must be shown or not; it is sufficient that 
the presumption of jurisdiction attending the action of a court of record has 
not been overcome and its judgment stands good.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed form is affirmed, with costs against the appellant. So 
ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Carson, Trent</em>, and <em>Araullo, JJ.</em>, concur. </p></div>
