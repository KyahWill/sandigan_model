				<H3>THE UNITED STATES,  PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS.  PEDRO MALIGALIG, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MAPA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The defendant herein is prosecuted for the theft of two horses, of which crime he was declared guilty by the Court of First&nbsp; Instance and sentenced&nbsp; as principal therein to the penalty of two years eleven months and one day of <span style="font-style: italic;">presidio correctional,</span> to&nbsp; pay an&nbsp; indemnity of P100 to&nbsp; the injured party for the unrecovered horse, or in case of insolvency to suffer the&nbsp; corresponding&nbsp; subsidiary&nbsp; imprisonment at&nbsp; the rate of one day for every 12Â£ pesetas&nbsp; that he failed to pay, and to pay the costs.<br><br>The guilt of the accused is so clearly proven&nbsp; in the case that, in&nbsp; this instance, the defense has raised no question whatever in connection therewith.&nbsp; The only question presented is that of the degree of liability which should be charged&nbsp; to&nbsp; him.&nbsp;&nbsp; There&nbsp; is no direct&nbsp; evidence that it was the accused who stole the horses, but they were found in his possession,&nbsp; and&nbsp; he&nbsp; gave&nbsp; no satisfactory&nbsp; explanation as to. whence they came; for&nbsp; this reason the court below found him guilty and convicted him as principal in the crime of theft.&nbsp; The defense claims that a person thus charged should only be held liable as&nbsp; accessary after the fact, not as principal.<br><br>This point has been repeatedly decided by this court contrary to the claim of the defense.&nbsp; Among others the case of the United States <i>vs.</i> Gabino Soriano (9 Phil. Rep., 445) may be cited, wherein it is said:<br><blockquote>"It is the settled rule of the.courts,&nbsp; on the question of criminal liability, that the finding of the <span style="font-style: italic;">corpus delicti</span> in the possession of a person establishes the presumption that he is the author of the crime, unless&nbsp; it be proven who was the real author, and that the bearer or holder of the stolen property is the mere accessary of the criminal&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *."<br></blockquote>The judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed with the costs of this instance against the appellant.&nbsp; So ordered,<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson, Carson, </i>and <i>Moreland, JJ., </i>concur.<br></div>
