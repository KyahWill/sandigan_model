				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On the 8th of February, 1911,  the provincial fiscal of Misamis, Agusan, and Surigao presented against the defendant a complaint of the following purport:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The  undersigned charges Cayetano Ramayrat with the crime of gross disobedience to the authorities, committed as follows:</p>
  <p>"That, on February 1,1910, one Sabino Vayson filed suit against  Cayetano Ramayrat, in the justice of  the peace court of Misamis (Exhibit A), for tfce recovery of possession of a parcel of land belonging to the said  Sabino Vayson;. that, on March 9, 1910, the said justice of the peace court rendered judgment by sentencing the said Cayetano Ramayrat to deliver the possession of the said land to the plaintiff, Sabino Vayson (Exhibit B); that, when Cosme Nonby, the deputy sheriff of the municipality of' Misamis, demanded of the defendant, Cayetano Ramayrat, on April  29, 1910, in this municipality of Misamis, Province of Misamis, within the jurisdiction of this court, that he deliver the  said land to the plaintiff,  Sabino  Vayson, the said defendant,  Cayetano Ramayrat,  voluntarily, unlawfully and criminally refused,  and still refuses, to deliver the said land to the aforementioned Sabino Vayson.  The Exhibits A, B, and C form an integral part of this complaint.  Said crime was committed in  violation of  the  law and, particularly,  of article 25? of the Penal Code."</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The defendant demurred  to the  complaint,  upon  the following grounds:</p>
<ol>
  <li> That the facts charged do not constitute a crime.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> That, in the complaint, allegations are made which, if true, would  be a justification  and  legal exemption for the defendant.</li>
</ol>
<p>By an order of February 9, 1911, the court sustained the demurrer interposed by the defense and therefore dismissed the complaint, with the costs de ofieio.  From this order an appeal has been taken by the Attorney-General.</p>
<p>Virtually, it is stated in the order appealed from that the defendant grossly disobeyed the order  of the  justice of the peace court (Exhibits B and C) to deliver the land in question to Sabino Vayson; that such disobedience, were it punishable,  would fall within the sanction of sections 232 and 236 of Act No. 190  (Code of Procedure in Civil Actions), and not of article 252 of the Penal Code, which latter, in the opinion of the court, was repealed by the two former, in so far as it be incompatible therewith; and that, inasmuch as the said sections of Act No, 190 punish the disobedience to judicial orders only when these latter are legal, and that the order herein concerned  of the  justice of the peace is manifestly  illegal,  the  result follows as a necessary conclusion, according to the trial judge, that the disobedience charged to the defendant in the complaint does not constitute a penally actionable  matter, pursuant to the law.  And it is said in the  same order appealed from that the aforementioned order of the justice  of the  peace is illegal for the reason that it was issued in an action brought for the recovery of  possession of land, which could  not validly be heard by a justice of the peace court, as such classes of actions come exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Courts of First Instance.</p>
<p>Section 232 of Act No, 190, cited in the order appealed from, provides, in part, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"SEC. 232. <em>What other acts  are  contempts of court</em>.—A person guilty of any of the following acts may be punished as for contempt:</p>
  <p>"(a)  Disobedience of, or resistance to, a lawful writ, process, order, judgment, or command of a court, or injunction granted by a court or judge;</p>
  <p align="center">*       *      *       *       *      *       *"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Section 236 penalizes such acts of contempt with a fine that shall not exceed  one thousand pesos, or  imprisonment of not more than six months,  or both, in the discretion of the court.</p>
<p>Article 252 of the Penal Code, cited in the complaint and which the trial court held to be repealed by the said sections of the Code of  Civil Procedure, is as follows: <br></p><blockquote><p>"Art. 252. The persons who, without being included in article 249, should resist the authorities, or their agents, or should  grossly  disobey them  in the performance of the duties of their office, shall be punished with the penalties of arresto mayor and a fine of from 325 to 3,250 pesetas."</p></blockquote>
<p>The Attorney-General alleges as a ground for his appeal that the trial court erred in holding that  disobedience of judicial orders is not comprised within article 252 of the Penal Code and  that this  article was repealed by sections 232 and 236 of the Code of Civil Procedure, in so far as it was incompatible therewith.</p>
<p>In view of the opinion we have formed of the facts alleged in the complaint, it becomes unnecessary for us to decide the aforementioned  questions set up in the Attorney-General's brief.  We  do  not  think that  the defendant  disobeyed any judicial order whatever.  The order issued by the justice of the peace  (Exhibit C) and alleged to have been disobeyed, is a writ of execution and addressed, as was natural and proper, to the competent sheriff, and not to the defendant,  In it the sheriff is commanded to place the plaintiff, Sabino Vayson, who had won in the suit against the herein defendant for the recovery of the property, in possession of the said disputed land.   Such command is  made solely and exclusively  to the  sheriff, and not tb  the defendant. Absolutely no order whatsoever is made to the latter; nothing is demanded of him and he is not restrained from doing anything, neither is  he required to do anything; he is not told to perform,  or not to perform, any act whatsoever; in a word, the writ or order in question in  no wise refers to him.   Nor could this process, indeed, be addressed to the defendant, for the reason that it wholly concerns the execution of a judgment, the serving of which is specially and exclusively incumbent upon the sheriff.  And  it is superfluous to add that the defendant  could hardly disobey an order that in no wise concerned him.  The order itself leaves this to be clearly understood by warning the sheriff, and no  one else, that he shall be liable to the penalties of the law in case of noncompliancc.  "Failure to comply with this order," it says literally, "will subject you," the sheriff, "to the penalties of the law.5'  The  warning  is solely for the sheriff, because the writ must be served by him, and he alone it was who could fail to comply with or  disobey it</p>
<p>But, while the defendant did  not  disobey the said writ of execution, may it be said that he disobeyed the sentence of the justice o^ the peace who ordered that he restore the disputed land to  the  plaintiff, Vayson?  It is contended by the Attorney-General in his brief  that he did.   He says that the act performed by the defendant in setting forth in Exhibit C-2 thai he was not  willing to deliver the land to Vayson was one of disobedience to the said sentence.   This may be  true, and undoubtedly is,  in a certain sense,—in the same sense that it may be said  that he who  infringes or violates any law passed by the legislative power disobeys its  authority; or that the defendant who refuses to surrender himself voluntarily and of  his own free accord to the prison authorities for the purpose of serving his sentence disobeys the sentence that imposes imprisonment upon him. But this is not the disobedience that is punished as a crime by article 252 of the Penal Code.  The juridical conception of this  crime consists in a failure to comply with orders directly issued by the authorities in the exercise  of their official duties, and not with legal provisions of a general character, nor with judicial decisions merely declaratory of rights or obligations, such as those proper to be rendered in a civil suit relative to property or the possession of land, like that which gave rise to the present controversy.  Nor even  do the violations of prohibitory  decisions,  although undoubtedly of  a more serious  character,  constitute the crime of disobedience to the  authorities provided  for and punished by the aforecited article  of the Penal Code, for they give rise only to a civil action.   (Decisions of the supreme court of Spain of September  25  and October 4, 1889, and June  30, 1893.)</p>
<p>The judgment of the justice of the peace which is supposed to have been disobeyed, orders, it is true, the herein defendant to return the land, the subject of the suit, to the plaintiff,  Vayson, but it does not order him, nor could it legally order him, to effect the return himself.  As hereinbefore stated, this is the duty of the sheriff, to whom the law entrusts the execution of judgments.</p>
<p>The Code of Civil Procedure contains the following provisions with respect to writs of execution :</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"SEC. 443.  <em>When execution may  issue</em>.—The  party in whose favor judgment is given, may,  at any time  within five years after the entry thereof have a writ of execution issued for its  enforcement, as hereinafter provided.</p>
  <p>"SEC. 444. <em>Issuance, form, and requisites of execution</em>.—The execution must be issued in the name  of the United States of  America, Philippine Islands, sealed with the seal of the court, and subscribed by the judge, or clerk thereof, and be directed to the governor of the  province,  or any of his deputies, and must intelligibly refer to  the judgment, stating the court, and the province where the record of the judgment is  *  *  *,  and must  direct the governor or his deputy,  substantially as follows:</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
  <p>"(e)  If it be for the delivery of the possession  of real or personal property, it  must  require  the governor, or  his deputy, to deliver the possession of the  same, describing it, to the party entitled thereto.   *  *   *"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to  these sections, it is exclusively  incumbent upon the sheriff to execute, to carry out the mandates of the judgment  in question, and, in fact, it was he himself, and he alone,  who was ordered by the justice of  the peace who rendered  that judgment, to place the plaintiff, Vayson, in possession of the land.  The defendant in this  case had nothing to do  with that delivery of possession, and, consequently, his statements expressing his refusal or unwillingness to  effect  the same, are entirely  officious and impertinent and therefore could not hinder, and much less prevent, the delivery being made, had  the  sheriff known how to             comply with his duty.  It was  solely due to the latter's fault, and not to the alleged disobedience of the defendant, that the judgment was not duly executed.  For that purpose the sheriff could even have availed  himself  of the public force, had it been necessary to resort thereto.</p>
<p>The Attorney-General brings up still another aspect of the case.  He states in his brief that the defendant grossly disobeyed an agent of the authorities, such as is the sheriff, by not delivering the land to Vayson, as he was ordered to do  by the said  sheriff.  In accordance with article  252 of the Penal Code, disobedience to the agents of the authorities is punishable only when they are in the exercise of the duties  that particularly pertain to their officef  As aforesaid, the duty of the sheriff in the present case  was to place Vayson in possession of the land.  Instead  of  so doing, he limited his action to telling or ordering the defendant to deliver the land to the  said Vayson.  In acting in this wise, not only did he fail duly to discharge his official duty, but he openly neglected to  perform the same. He had no right whatever to  require that the defendant should perform a duty which he himself ought to have performed: to do so, would  be tantamount  to  imposing one's own  duties upon another, which,  evidently, would be illegal   and  unjust. Under such circumstances, the defendant's  disobedience, if any there  were, does not constitute  the crime  aforementioned.</p>
<p>Upon  the  foregoing grounds we hold  that  the facts alleged in the complaint do not  constitute a crime;  we, therefore; affirm the order appealed from, with the costs <em>de oficio.</em></p>

<p><strong>CARSON, J.:</strong></p>
<p>I concur.   I think it proper, however, to indicate that as I understand it, the majority opinion  is not  to be  construed as holding that defendant would  not have been guilty of the offense defined and penalized in article 252 of the Penal Code had he refused to surrender possession of the property <i>to the sheriff himself</i>, upon demand therefor, in order that the sheriff himself might give possession to the person entitled thereto as indicated in the writ.</p>
