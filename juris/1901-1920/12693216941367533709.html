				<H3>LUIS RIVAYA, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. FELIX SAMSON, RAFAEL VILLANUEVA, ANICETO G. MEDEL, DEFENDANTS. FELIX SAMSON, APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The plaintiff commenced the present action on the 23d day of March, 1911, in 
the Court of First Instance of the Province of Albay, to recover the possession, 
as owner, of three parcels of land, more particularly described in the second 
paragraph of the complaint, together with damages for the illegal detention of 
the same.
<p>To the complaint each of the defendants filed a separate answer. The 
defendant Rafael Villanueva, in his answer, recognized the rights of the 
plaintiff to the land in question.</p>
<p>The defendant Aniceto G. Medel answered, stating that he was ignorant of the 
respective rights of the plaintiff and of the defendants, Villanueva and Samson, 
and prayed the court to make an investigation, for the purpose of ascertaining 
who was the real owner of the land, as between the said parties.</p>
<p>The defendant Felix Samson, in his answer, alleged that he was the owner of 
certain parcels of land located in the same sitio as the land which the 
plaintiff was attempting to recover and prayed that he be relieved from any 
responsibility under the complaint.</p>
<p>Upon the issue thus formed, the cause was brought to trial on the 21st of 
February, 1912. It appearing from the allegations of the petition and answer 
that the only question presented to the court was one relating to the identity 
of the lands in question, the parties agreed to the appointment of a 
commissioner for the following purposes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"1. To prepare a map or plan of the land showing each of the parcels as well 
as their metes and bounds and their respective areas.</p>
<p>"2. To examine witnesses and take in writing their testimony as to the 
several parcels of land and as to whom they belonged at the public sale that was 
had.</p>
<p>"3. To determine whether or not the land which Felix Samson states in his 
answer was bought by him is the same land described in the complaint of 
plaintiff Luis Rivaya; and</p>
<p>"4. To set forth in his report all those facts the insertion whereof the 
parties may request in writing."</p></blockquote>
<p>It was further agreed that the court should appoint Mr. Jose Sarte of the 
pueblo of Ligao, Province of Albay, as said commissioner, for the purpose of 
making an investigation and to report as soon as possible upon the questions 
submitted to him.</p>
<p>It was further agreed that the court should render a final judgment upon the 
report of the said commissioner.</p>
<p>On the 19th day of August, 1912, the said commissioner made his report. To 
that report, the defendant, Felix son, objected and moved that the court order 
the said commissioner to make a further investigation and another report. The 
court granted the objection and the motion of the defendant Samson.</p>
<p>On the 28th day of September, 1912, the said commissioner made his second 
report. To the second report the defendant Samson also objected. The lower 
court, after hearing the arguments of the defendant Samson to the second report, 
overruled said objection and rendered a decision upon the facts stated in said 
second report of said commissioner.</p>
<p>The lower court found, from the facts stated in said second report, that the 
plaintiff was the owner and entitled to the possession of the three parcels of 
land described in his complaint and ordered the defendant Samson to return to 
the plaintiff said parcels of land and to pay the costs. From that decision the 
defendant Samson appealed to this court and made several assignments of 
error.</p>
<p>The appellant devotes much space in his brief in attempting to show that the 
lower court committed an error in basing his judgment upon the report of the 
commissioner. It is true that the commissioner was not appointed in accordance 
with the provisions of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions. (Sees. 135, 136.) 
Nevertheless, the record shows that he was appointed by agreement of the 
parties. The record also shows that the parties agreed that the judge should 
base his decision upon the facts stated in the report of said commissioner. 
While the appellant attempts to show that the commissioner did not consider all 
of the proof which he presented, yet he does not attempt to show that, even if 
the proof had been considered by the commissioner and had been presented to the 
court, that it would in any manner have changed the result. The mere fact that 
the commissioner considered unimportant some of the proof which the appellant 
presented, which the appellant thought was important, is not sufficient to 
justify a reversal of the judgment, unless and until it is shown that such proof 
was in fact important and sufficient to overcome the evidence admitted. The 
appellant makes no effort to show, admitting that all of the proof had not been 
taken into consideration by the commissioner, that it was sufficient to counter 
balance the proof which the commissioner did consider.</p>
<p>Some argument was adduced during the consideration of the cause to the effect 
that, inasmuch as the commissioner had not been appointed in accordance with the 
provisions of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions, all of his acts were null 
and that the cause should be reversed on that account. It is a well-known fact 
that in many of the provinces of the Philippine Islands the courts are called 
upon to consider questions relating to the title of lands which are situated a 
great distance from the capital of the province where the coort is held, The 
method adopted in the present case is one of great convenience to the court, as 
well as to the parties litigant. To require witnesses to travel a great distance 
for the purpose of giving their testimony in court, when, by the appointment of 
a commissioner, their testimony may be taken in the community where they reside, 
would be a matter of great inconvenience to them, and not only to them but to 
the parties litigant. For the reason that the parties agreed that the testimony 
should be taken before a commissioner and that the court should base his 
conclusions upon the report of said commissioner, we find no good reason for 
reversing or modifying the decision of the court, simply because one or the 
other of the parties is not satisfied with the report of the commissioner.</p>
<p>We find nothing in the record which justifies a modification or reversal of 
the judgment of the lower court. The same is therefore hereby affirmed, with 
costs.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres</em> and <em>Araullo,</em> concur,</p>
<p><strong>CARSON, J.,</strong> with whom concurs <strong>TRENT, J.,</strong> 
concurring:</p>
<p>I concur on the ground that the facts set forth in the so-called 
commissioner's report were facts stipulated by the parties upon which the case 
was submitted for judgment.<br></p></div><br>
