				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This&nbsp; is an&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; from a decree of the&nbsp; Court of Land Registration adjudicating title&nbsp; to a small lot or parcel of land in the city of Manila in favor of the appellees and ordering its registry in&nbsp; accordance with the provisions of "The Land Registration Act."<br><br>The Government of the Philippine Islands, through its proper representatives, objected to the application for registry on the ground that, as it alleges, the land in question is a part of the public domain, as defined in subsection 1, article 339, of the Civil Code, which is as follows:<br><blockquote>"Art. 339. Property of public ownership is - <br><br>"1. That destined to the public use, such as roads, canals, rivers, torrents, ports, and bridges constructed by the State, and banks, shores, roadsteads, and&nbsp; that of a similar&nbsp; character." and also as&nbsp; denned in article 1 of "The&nbsp; Law&nbsp; of Waters" (Ley&nbsp; de Aguas)&nbsp; of the 3d of August, 1886, which&nbsp; is as follows:<br><br>"The following belong to the national domain and are for the public use:<br><center><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></center><br>"3.&nbsp; <i>The shores</i>. - 'Shore' is understood&nbsp; to be&nbsp; that space which is alternatively covered and uncovered by water with the movement of the tides.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its interior or terrestrial&nbsp; limit is marked by the line reached by the highest tides and&nbsp; equinoctials.&nbsp; Where&nbsp; the tides are not perceptible the shore begins at the line reached by the water during tempests and ordinary storms."<br></blockquote>The evidence of record leaves no room for doubt that, as alleged by the opponent, the land in question, at the&nbsp; time when the trial was had&nbsp; in the court below, was so located that at high tide&nbsp; it was completely&nbsp; covered by the&nbsp; waters of the Bay of Manila, though the receding waters left it&nbsp; completely&nbsp; bare at low tide.&nbsp;&nbsp; It can not be denied, therefore, that if there were no other evidence of record, touching the physical status of this&nbsp; land or the&nbsp; title thereto, the&nbsp; contention of the Government would necessarily be sustained.<br><br>It appears, however, that in the year 1892 a possessory title to the land in question was duly registered in favor of Inocencio Aragon, one of the&nbsp; predecessors in&nbsp; interest of these applicants; that for a long period of years, and perhaps from a time beyond which the memory of man runneth not to the contrary, the applicants and their predecessors in interest have&nbsp; been in possession of the parcel&nbsp; of land in question, under an undisputed claim of ownership; that it is located well toward the center of one of the most valuable residential sections of the city of Manila, and that for many years a&nbsp; house stood upon this&nbsp; land, and&nbsp; was occupied by some of the predecessors in interest of the applicants in these proceedings; that with some relatively small expenditure by way of a "fill" or a "retaining wall" it would still be a valuable building lot for residential purposes; that the adjoining lots extend toward the bay to a line formed by the extension of the outer boundary line of the lot in question, and that these adjoining&nbsp; lots would be in&nbsp; substantially the same physical condition,&nbsp; by relation&nbsp; to the ebb&nbsp; and&nbsp; flow of the tide, as the lot in question, but for low retaining walls which protect them against the incoming sea; that the water which spreads over the lot&nbsp; in&nbsp; question at high tide is of but little depth, and would&nbsp; be&nbsp; wholly excluded by a very limited amount of "filling" materials or a low retaining wall; that there are strong reasons&nbsp; to believe&nbsp; that the land in question was originally well above the ebb and flow of the tide; and that only in later years have the waters risen to such a&nbsp; height&nbsp; along the&nbsp; shores of the Bay of Manila at this point as&nbsp; to cover the&nbsp; land in question completely at high tide; though it does not definitely appear whether this is due to changes in the current and flow&nbsp; of the waters in the bay, or to the gradual sinking of the land along the coast.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>We think that these facts conclusively establish&nbsp; the right of possession and ownership of&nbsp; the applicants.<br><br>Article 446 of the Civil Code is as follows:<br><blockquote>"Every possessor&nbsp; has a right to be respected in his&nbsp; possession;&nbsp; and should he be&nbsp; disturbed therein,&nbsp; he&nbsp; must be protected or possession must be restored to him&nbsp; by the means established in the&nbsp; laws of procedure."<br></blockquote>Article 460&nbsp; of that code is as follows:<br><blockquote>"Art. 460. The possessor may lose his possession -<br><br>"1. By the abandonment of the thing.<br><br>"2. By transfer to another for a good&nbsp; or valuable consideration.<br><br>"3. By the destruction or total loss of the thing or by the thing becoming unmarketable.<br><br>"4. By the possession of another, even against the will of the former possessor, if the new possession&nbsp; has lasted more than one year."<br></blockquote>Under these provisions of the code it seems quite clear that if the Government is justified in disturbing the&nbsp; possession of the applicants, it can only be on the ground&nbsp; that they have abandoned their property, or that it has been totally destroyed and has now become a part of the public domain by the erosive action of the sea. It is&nbsp; quite clear that applicants have never. abandoned their&nbsp; possession&nbsp; under a claim of ownership of&nbsp; this land.&nbsp; And we think the facts above stated fully sustain a finding that there has been no such destructive or total loss&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; property&nbsp; as&nbsp; would Justify&nbsp; a holding&nbsp; that the&nbsp; owners have lost possession. Doubtless the property has been injured by the erosive action of the sea.&nbsp;&nbsp; Doubtless the owners in order to profitably enjoy the possession of this property will be compelled to make some, relatively small expenditures by way of&nbsp; a&nbsp; "fill" or a retaining wall.&nbsp; But the actual condition of the property as it appears from the record makes a claim that it has been totally lost or destroyed preposterous and wholly untenable.&nbsp; We need&nbsp; hardly add that if the applicants have not lost their right of&nbsp; possession, the Government's claim of ownership, on the ground that this land is a part of the <i> playa</i> (shore) of Manila Bay, necessarily falls to the ground.<br><br>We should&nbsp; not be understood, by this decision, to hold; that in&nbsp; a case of gradual encroachment or erosion by the ebb and flow of the tide, private property may not become "property of public ownership," as defined&nbsp; in article 339 of the code, where it appears that the owner has to all intents and purposes abandoned&nbsp; it and permitted it to&nbsp; be totally destroyed, so as to&nbsp; become a part of the "playa"&nbsp; (shore of the sea), "rada"&nbsp; (roadstead), or the like.&nbsp; Our ruling in this&nbsp; case is merely that it&nbsp; affirmatively appears that the owners of the land in question have never in&nbsp; fact nor&nbsp; in intent abandoned it, and that keeping in mind its location and actual condition it can not be said to have&nbsp; been totally&nbsp; destroyed for the purposes for which it was held by them, so as to have become a part of the playa&nbsp; (shore)&nbsp; of the Bay of Manila.<br><br>The decree entered by the lower court should be affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.&nbsp; It is so ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J., Mapa, Moreland,</i> and<i> Trent, JJ.</i>, concur.<br></div>
