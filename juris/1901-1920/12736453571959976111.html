				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">There have come before us the petitions of the 23d and 25th of last November 
whereby counsel for the defendant, Oria Hermanos &amp; Co., making an amended 
motion for a rehearing, prays for a reopening of the case in order to afford the 
parties an opportunity for a new discussion on the request made to this court to 
reconsider its decision. Said counsel alleged that the decision of the 12th of 
last November<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> is openly at variance 
with the previous decision of March 30, 1915,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> inasmuch as the former approves the 
rendition of accounts by the plaintiff without due proof in the matter of the 
invoices relative to the rice and kerosene oil and the internal revenue taxes, 
while by the later decision, the plaintiff Gutierrez Hermanos was ordered to 
render a vouchered account of these invoices and taxes. The later decision of 
this court is not a strict compliance and is not in agreement with what was 
ordered in the.earlier decision, inasmuch as in the later decision there was 
approved a rendition of accounts without proof by means of the exhibition of 
documents, vouchers and books which Gutierrez Hermanos did not present.
<p>The petitioner's chief contention consists precisely in that this court, in 
approving in its decision of the 12th of last November the second report of the 
referee, of the date of June 29, 1916, fixed the amount which was to be deducted 
from the sum claimed by the plaintiff Gutierrez Hermanos, basing this finding 
upon a liquidation and account rendered without vouchers; wherefore the first 
decision of March 30, 1915, was not complied with, as regards said invoices of 
rice and kerosene oil and the internal revenue taxes.</p>
<p>If the suits and litigations brought before the courts are to be decided in 
accordance with the pleadings and evidence submitted by the parties, and if mere 
pleadings without proof to show the propriety and justice of a claim are 
insufficient, then, as Oria Hermanos &amp; Co. did not succeed in proving, 
during the trial of the present case in the Court of First Instance, that the 
amount of the increase in the weight and price of the rice and kerosene oil and 
the amount of the overcharge of certain sums over the value of these commodities 
constitute a greater sum than that fixed in the decision of this court rendered 
on November 12th last, to wit, P37,063.57, which is to be deducted from that 
contained in the decision of March 30, 1915, to wit, P147,204.28, nothing could 
be more just and logical than the pronouncement contained in this court's last 
decision that is the subject of the petitioner's motion.</p>
<p>Irrefutable as is the averment by the plaintiff, Gutierrez Hermanos, that the 
defendant, Oria Hermanos &amp; Co., owed it the sum claimed, that is, 
P147,204.28, according to the documentary evidence which the plaintiff had 
presented, and said claim having been contested by the debtor, Oria Hermanos 
&amp; Co., the latter firm, in order to prove that the plaintiff had defrauded 
it by increasing the price of the rice and kerosene oil and the weight of the 
grain in the invoices, and by unduly charging, in these latter and in the 
internal revenue account, amounts to which the plaintiff was not entitled, 
averred that such fraudulent increases amounted to P273,425.17, which sum, 
compared with that stated in the said decision, would show a balance in favor of 
Oria Hermanos &amp; Co. of P56,544.24. This sum appears in the documents that 
form Exhibit A.</p>
<p>With respect to the schedules or statements that compose Exhibit A, the 
referee states on page 58 of his report that there is no proof as to how the 
figures and conclusions set out in said schedules or statements of fraud's were 
arrived at, and that he could not accept such alleged frauds as a justification 
of the claim of Oria Hermanos &amp; Co. against Gutierrez Hermanos. After a very 
close and careful examination of the record, together with the documents and 
books thereto attached, this court also has found no proof that the increase in 
the price and weight of the rice, and the amounts given as overcharges in the 
price of the said article and in that of the kerosene oil, amount to the 
aforementioned sum of P273,425.17, nor that there is a balance of P56,544.24 in 
favor of Oria Hermanos &amp; Co.</p>
<p>There would have been no certain and sufficient reason for the commission of 
such an injustice as would have been committed by a failure to acknowledge the 
existence of such a balance in favor of the defendant, Oria Hermanos &amp; Co., 
if the latter had furnished satisfactory proof of its contention and claims, for 
its counsel well knew that the defendant was at the same time a claimant and 
plaintiff in the matter of the exception and therefore obliged to prove that it 
was the creditor of a certain sum in which said balance consisted, and that 
Gutierrez Hermanos was owing it that sum.</p>

<p>If, for want of books and vouchers, Gutierrez Hermanos did not succeed in 
proving the certainty and exactness of the contents of the invoices, especially 
of the invoices of rice, and if Oria Hermanos &amp; Co. had presented proof that 
showed that Gutierrez Hermanos, instead of being its creditor, was still its 
debtor to the extent of P56,544.24, it would have been a glaring and flagrant 
injustice for this court not to have heeded the defendant's pleading and 
proofs. It was alleged and very much discussed, but not proven, that Oria Hermanos 
&amp; Co. was the creditor that it claims to be, and not the debtor as the 
evidence discloses it is.</p>
<p>In view of the fact that the firm of Gutierrez Hermanos could not or would 
not present a vouchered account, alleging that is was quite a long time since 
the books and their vouchers had disappeared, and in the absence of proof to the 
contrary the trial court was authorized to approve the account and liquidation 
made by the referee inasmuch as the party obliged to render and present the 
accounts had not done so, and the referee was appointed by the court in 
conformity with law and with the agreement had between the parties^</p>
<p>It is not a question of the value of the hundreds of sacks of rice received 
by Oria Hermanos &amp; Co. and for which this company is a debtor to Gutierrez 
Hermanos, but the point in issue concerns the surcharges, extra prices and other 
increases complained of by Oria Hermanos &amp; Co. and unsubstantiated by 
vouchers. In a suit for the tender or rendition of accounts both parties are at 
the same time each plaintiff and defendant, as in a double action, and, 
consequently, both should have submitted their respective proof, but as they did 
not do so, the trial court, in order to terminate the suit at once, abided by 
the report of the referee and the result of the accounts which the latter drew 
up after hearing both parties. (Decision of the supreme court of Spain of March 
7, 1867.)</p>
<p>In view of the fact, then, that Gutierrez Hermanos has not proven the true 
price of the rice and kerosene oil to which the invoices in question refer, nor 
the origin or the legitimacy of the surcharges and other increases which it had 
included in said invoices, and, on the other hand, it being unquestionable that 
Oria Hermanos &amp; Co. received the rice and kerosene oil, though it also has 
not proven its averments, this court, in view of the evidence, rendered decision 
in accordance with the law by admitting, though not absolutely, the conclusions 
of the referee in his second report, for, due to the failure of both parties to 
submit proof relative solely to the alleged extra prices, surcharges and other 
improper increases made by Gutierrez Hermanos in said invoices, and owing to the 
further fact of there being no record of the denial by Oria Hermanos &amp; Co. 
of its having received the rice and kerosene oil the price of which it was 
claimed was increased to its prejudice by the shipper, the commercial firm of 
Gutierrez Hermanos/this court could not have incurred the error of relying upon 
the first report of the referee and failing to decide the suit by a declaration 
of the respective liability accruing to each of the litigating parties and, 
accordingly, to fix the sum which the defendant owes to the plaintiff and the 
sum which must be deducted from the defendant's debt and in its favor, for the 
reason that not because Gutierrez Hermanos, with intent of gain, increased the 
price and the weight of the rice and the kerosene oil and increased other sums, 
the total amount of which, discretionally fixed, should be deducted from its 
credit, would Oria Hermanos &amp; Co. not be obliged to pay the true value and 
price of the effects which it had received according to the evidence shown in 
the record.</p>
<p>The reservation of qualifying as fraudulent the conduct of Gutierrez Hermanos 
in its preparation of said invoices, as stated in the previous decision of March 
30, 1915, depends on the evidence adduced by both parties at the trial, 
although, according to that evidence, weighed in the decision which is the 
subject matter of the motion, this court would not have held that it should have 
made such a qualification, perhaps inopportune and premature in view of the 
existing evidence.</p>
<p>For the foregoing reasons, the motion for reconsideration presented by the 
petitioner is denied, with costs. So ordered</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Carson, Street, Malcolm,</em> and <em>Avanceña, 
JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Araullo, J.</em>, did not take part.</p>
