				G.R. No. 1994, January 11, 1906</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED  STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. WILLIAM GEORGE HOLLIS, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This defendant was charged with the crime of falsification of a public document, in  the Court of First Instance of the Province  of  Occidental Negros.   He was tried by said court, found guilty of the crime  charged in said complaint, and sentenced to be imprisoned for a period of ten years and one day of <em>presidio mayor</em>, to pay a fine of 8,751 pesetas, with  the accessories of  the law, to pay the costs, and to indemnify one James D.  Fauntleroy in the sum of $123, United  States  currency.  From  this decision  the defendant appealed to this court.</p>
<p>The document with reference to which the falsification was made was a check or bill of exchange for $123, United States currency, issued by the Deputy Treasurer of  the United States, No. 3230, and dated at Washington the 7th day of November,  1902, payable to one James D. Fauntleroy, captain of the Twenty-seventh Volunteers, United States Infantry.  The complaint  charges that this  check or bill of exchange  came into the  hands of the defendant, who forged the name of the said Fauntleroy in an indorsement  upon the said document, and  thereby received  the money due upon said document.  This document was introduced in evidence together with the alleged forged indorsement  thereon and was marked "Exhibit 2."   There was much proof introduced during the trial to show that such indorsement was made in the handwriting of the said defendant.   There was also introduced during  the trial documents  containing  the signature of the defendant as well as writings by him, for the purpose of showing that this alleged indorsement was  in  the handwriting of  the defendant.   Expert witnesses were also introduced for the purpose of showing that the alleged indorsement was in the handwriting of the defendant.   These expert witnesses made many comparisons of the alleged indorsement with the true  handwriting  of the defendant.</p>
<p>This document,  "Exhibit  2," does not now appear in the record  in  this  court  It has  been lost; where  or in what  manner  we are  unable to say; there  is no positive proof that it was ever received by the clerk of this  court. Whereas this  document furnishes  the  principal  evidence in the cause  against the defendant, and  whereas it is necessary for  this  court to have  the  said document in order  that it may ascertain for itself whether the alleged indorsement is a forgery or not, we are unable to reach a decision in the case without it and therefore hereby  order the said  cause to be returned to the inferior court  for a new trial.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Mapa, Carson,</em> and  <em>Willard, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
