				G.R. No. 2173, August 30, 1906</h4>
				<H3>MANILA NAVIGATION COMPANY, SOCIEDAD ANONIMA, PETITIONER, VS. JOE M. QUINTERO ET AL., RESPONDENTS.
  
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is an original action in this court, praying that the defendants  be prohibited and restrained from proceeding further in an attempt to enforce the execution of a certain judgment rendered by the defendant, Jose M. Quintero, justice of the peace of the city of Manila, against the plaintiff and in favor of Leong Yong, one  of the defendants in this  case.</p>
<p>The defendants, Jose M. Quintero, justice of the peace of the city  of Manila,  and J. J.  Peterson, sheriff of the city  of Manila,  appear in person, and disclaiming all interest in the action, submit themselves to the judgment of the court, and the defendant, Leong Yong,  the real party in interest, appears  by counsel and  admits the truth of the facts  set out in the complaint and formally consents to the rendering of a judgment in  favor of the plaintiff.</p>
<p>It is not quite clear from the language used whether the prayer of the complaint  as set out in Spanish is for the issuance of a permanent injunction or for a writ of prohibition, but  since the language used, if liberally construed, may be taken to mean a prayer of prohibition, and the only defendant in interest admits the truth of the allegations of the complaint and consents to the rendering of judgment in  behalf  of the  plaintiff, and  since prohibition is the proper  remedy  in the premises  and  this court  has  no original jurisdiction  in injunction proceedings save in so far as it may grant writs of preliminary injunction in certain cases, we think that prohibition should issue in accordance with the prayer of the complaint with costs in  favor of the plaintiff and against  Leong Yong, the real defendant in interest.</p>
<p>After ten days  let  judgment  be entered in accordance herewith.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J.,  Torres,  Mapa, Willard,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
