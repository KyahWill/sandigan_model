rapto (abduction), committed as follows:
<blockquote>
<p>"That on or about the 11th day of August, 1913, in the City of Manila, 
Philippine Islands, the said Manuel Guazon willfully, unlawfully and feloniously 
did then and there abduct with her consent and with lewd desire one Encarnacion 
Gallardo, a virgin over twelve and less than twenty-three years of age, to wit: 
about fifteen years old.<br>" Contrary to law. "</p></blockquote>
<p>He was sentenced to one year, eight months and twenty-one days of prision 
correccional, the payment of the costs, and to the indemnification of the 
injured party in the sum of P250 or in default thereof subsidiary imprisonment, 
and to the maintenance of the offspring if there should be any.</p>
<p>The evidence of record conclusively establishes his guilt, and we find no 
error in the proceedings prejudicial to the substantial rights of the 
accused.</p>
<p>The only real questions raised upon the appeal have to do with the 
credibility of the various witnesses called at the trial, but we find nothing in 
the record which would justify us in disturbing the findings of fact by the 
trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses testify. All the other contentions 
of counsel for defendant and appellant are sufficiently and satisfactorily 
disposed of in the brief filed by the Attorney-General.</p>
<p>The Judgment of the court below convicting and sentencing the defendant and 
appellant should therefore be and is hereby affirmed, with the costs of this 
instance against the appellant.</p>
<p>It is so ordered.</p></div>
