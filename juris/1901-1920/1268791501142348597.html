				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><blockquote>
<p>"The death of the appellee in these proceedings having been suggested on the 
record, This court, on the 8th of January, 1913, issued an order giving the 
proper representatives of the estate of the deceased, if any there be, thirty 
days within which to appear and have themselves made parties to the 
proceedings.</p></blockquote>
<p>No action has yet been taken by the interested parties, and counsel for 
appellant now prays that the case be set down for hearing without further 
delay.</p>
<p>The practice heretofore adopted in this court, in cases where the death of a 
party has been suggested on the record, has been to suspend the proceedings; to 
give the proper representatives of the estate of the deceased a reasonable time 
within which to present themselves voluntarily and to be made parties on proper 
proof of their right of representation ; and in the event that no such voluntary 
appearance is entered, to require the opposite party to secure the appointment 
of a legal representative of the estate of the deceased and to require such 
legal representative, when appointed, to appear and become a party to the 
proceedings.</p>
<p>Experience has demonstrated that this procedure has not given satisfactory 
results, and after due consideration, the court has this day adopted the 
following additional rules touching proceedings in cases wherein the death of a 
party is suggested on the record.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Additional rules of the Supreme Court touching proceedings in eases 
wherein the death of a party is suggested on the record.</em></p>
<p>"1. Whenever, "pending appellate proceedings in this court, either party 
shall die, the proper representatives of the deceased person may voluntarily 
come in and be admitted parties to the proceedings, and thereupon .the 
proceedings shall be heard and determined as in other cases; and if such 
representatives shall not voluntarily become parties, then the other party may 
suggest the death on the record, accompanying the suggestion with evidence, by 
affidavit or otherwise, satisfactorily establishing the death, and may on motion 
obtain an order that unless such representatives shall become parties within 
ninety days there-after, the party moving for such order, if he be the appellee, 
shall be entitled to have the appellate proceedings dismissed; and if the party 
so moving shall be the appellant, he shall be entitled, on motion, to open the 
record, and on hearing to have final judgment entered, disposing of the 
appellate proceedings as justice may require under all the circumstances of the 
case.<br><br><em>"Provided, however,</em> That the court may, in the interests 
of justice, extend the time thus allowed for the appearance of such 
representatives; and </p>
<p><em>"Provided further,</em> That a copy of every such order shall be printed 
by the moving party, in some newspaper of general circulation throughout the 
Philippine Islands, previously designated by the clerk of this court, once a 
week for four successive weeks, the cost of such publication to be taxed in like 
manner as are the costs in other cases; and, </p>
<p><em>"Provided further,</em> That should it appear that the death occurred 
after final submission of the case on appeal, the proceedings will not be 
suspended, unless upon the suggestion of the death on the record it appears that 
in the, interests of justice an opportunity should be extended the proper 
representatives of the deceased to come in and be admitted as parties to the 
proceedings.</p>
<p>"2. Upon the suggestion on the record of the death of a party, pending 
appellate proceedings in this court, and upon satisfactory proof that there are 
proper representatives of the estate of the deceased within the Philippine 
Islands, the opposite party may, on motion, obtain an order that, unless such 
representatives shall make themselves parties within thirty days from notice of 
such order, the moving party, if he shall be the appellee, shall be entitled to 
have the proceedings dismissed, and if he shall be the appellant, shall be 
entitled to open the record, and on hearing, have final judgment entered, 
disposing of the proceedings as justice may require under all the circumstances 
of the case.</p>
<p>"3. When the death of a party is suggested on the record, supported by 
satisfactory proof of the death, and the representatives of the deceased do not 
appear within twelve months thereafter, and no measures are taken by the 
opposite party within that time to compel their appearance, the court may, on 
its own motion, dismiss the proceedings, or take such other action as may be 
deemed proper in the premises."</p></blockquote>
<p>The motion of counsel for appellant is denied, without prejudice to his right 
to proceed in conformity with the additional rules of court just adopted, which 
prescribe the appropriate procedure applicable to these proceedings in the 
status in which we now find them.</p>
