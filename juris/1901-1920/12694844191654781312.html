				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an original action brought in this court under authority of sections 
197, 201, 202 and 519 of the Code of Civil Procedure by reason of the alleged 
usurpation of a public office.
<p>The facts upon which the petitioner relies for relief are set out at length 
in our judgment in the demurrer to the original petition filed March 17, 
1917,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and our judgment on the demurrer 
to the supplemental petition filed February 4, 1918 p. 571, <em>ante</em>.</p>
<p>We concluded our decision disposing of the latter demurrer in the following 
language:</p>
<p>"We conclude that the demurrer to the amended petition should be overruled, 
and that unless an answer is filed within ten days (which we do not anticipate, 
as there is no real dispute as to the facts), judgment should be entered 
declaring the petitioner to be lawfully entitled to the office of municipal 
president of Candelaria, and the respondent De Gala to be unlawfully in 
possession of the same, with the costs of these proceedings against the 
latter.</p>
<p>"We assume that after the promulgation of our rulings as to the respective 
rights of the parties, the office in question will be promptly surrendered to 
the petitioner upon demand, and we shall not, for the present, make any 
provision for the forcible ouster of the respondent therefrom; but in the event 
that our anticipations are not verified in this regard, the petitioner is 
expressly authorized to make application for such further orders and relief as 
may be necessary to secure his right in the premises."</p>
<p>After waiting the full period of ten days allowed for the filing of the 
answer, counsel for each of the respondents now appears and enters a general 
denial on behalf of each of them; the answer on behalf of Generoso de Gala being 
couched in the following language:</p>
<p>"The defendant, Generoso de Gala, in answering the complaint alleges 
that:</p>
<p>"He makes a general and specific denial to each and all the allegations 
contained in both the original and supplemental complaints filed in this 
case.</p>
<p>"Wherefore he prays the honorable court to deny the petition with costs 
against petitioner."</p>
<p>We are well satisfied that these answers have been filed for the sole purpose 
of securing delay, in an effort on the part of the respondents to extend the 
already long drawn out period during which the petitioner has been unjustly 
deprived of the office now occupied by the respondent De Gala.</p>
<p>Our intimate knowledge of the whole course of these proceedings leads us to 
believe that the only real questions involved in this controversy arose out of 
the misapprehension by the respondents of the provisions of statutory law on 
which they based their claim of title to the office. After due deliberation we 
have ruled against them on all their contentions in this regard. A careful 
review of the whole record, having in mind the admissions and statements of 
counsel in oral argument with regard to the holding of the general elections of 
1916, leaves little room for doubt that there is no genuine controversy as to 
any of the material facts alleged by the petitioner.</p>
<p>The allegations of the original and the supplementary petitions are few and 
simple and are supported by the oath of the petitioner. In their very nature, 
the material allegations in both petitions are such as to preclude the 
probability of mistake or misunderstanding. They consist, for the most part, of 
averments as to official action taken by various boards and officers under color 
of which the respondents denied petitioner's right to the office; and in the 
absence of willful, malicious and at the same time utterly purposeless 
perversion of the truth by the petitioner, it is in the highest degree 
improbable that any material allegation in either petition can be successfully 
controverted or traversed in good faith.</p>
<p>The public interests demand that controversies over public office be 
terminated as speedily as may be consistent with the rights of the parties to a 
full and fair hearing, and this court will not brook any attempt by a party to 
such proceedings to delay the course of justice by the filing of sham or 
irrelevant pleadings, or by any course of procedure which appears to have been 
adopted with no other object than that of delaying justice and unduly prolonging 
the period during which the opposing party may be wrongfully deprived of an 
office to which he is lawfully entitled.</p>
<p>Let the following order be entered of record forthwith:</p>
<p>"Under authority of the provisions of section 107 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure, let the answers of both the respondents in these proceedings be 
stricken from the record, and judgment entered in accord with the order 
heretofore entered upon demurrer, unless within three days from notice of this 
order, either or both of the respondents specify in writing, duly verified under 
oath, some material averment or averments of the original or supplementary 
petition the truth and accuracy of which is denied; and permission is given the 
petitioner to move the court to impose triple costs and to take such other 
disciplinary measures as may seem proper in the event that it appears that any 
measure adopted by the respondents in the further course of these proceedings, 
is taken solely for delay and not for the purpose of securing the adjudication 
of a bona fide claim of right."</p>

JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
