				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This case was brought before the late <em>Audiencia, Territorial</em> of Manila for review  of the judgment of the 7th of November, 1894,  rendered by the then  judge of the First Instance of the District of Lipa, by which judgment Francisco Resaba was acquitted of the offense  of resistance to the agents of the authorities and the other accused were convicted of the offense  of <em>lesiones graves</em> and <em>menos graves</em>.  Unagan was sentenced to one year eight months and twenty-one  days of <em>prision correctional</em>, and Gregorio Lat, Valentin  Dimaano,  Mariano  Tagle, and Pelagio Unagan to two  months and one day of  <em>arresto mayor</em>, with accessories  and costs, the case having been dismissed with respect  to  Andres Cariaga, <em>alias</em> Pernis, he having died.  Counsel for the Government, however,  asked that the judgment below be reversed, and  that Francisco Resaba be convicted of the offense of resistance to the agents of the authorities and sentenced to one month and one day of <em>arresto mayor</em>, with a fine of 325 pesetas, and to the payment of a seventh part of the costs, one-half of the time of the preventive imprisonment to be computed, and also asks that the other defendants be acquitted, with the exception of the deceased Cariaga, they being exempt from criminal  responsibility by  reason  of  their  having  acted in the performance of an official duty, this  offense being established by section 11, article 8 of the Penal Code.</p>
<p>The undersigned concurs in the opinion of the representative  of the  Government  and accepts his  opinion  with respect to the findings of fact and the classification of the offense prosecuted.</p>
<p>In effect, the defendant Francisco Resaba, while armed and in company with the malefactor Cariaga, committed the crime of  resistance  to the agents of the authorities, because the officers when attempting to arrest these men were compelled to use force; and although it may be true that the record does not show that Resaba made an attack on the officers with a weapon, it is nevertheless unquestionable that he did resist them by refusing to obey and surrender to his captors, while Cariaga openly attacked them,  and  it  was on this account  that their captors wounded them.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the fact that  the  acts of the officers constituted the crimes of the discharge of a firearm and of <em>lesiones  graves</em>and <em>menos graves,</em> inflicted upon the persons of Cariaga and Resaba, nevertheless they are exempt from all responsibility, because they  were acting in  the performance of an official  duty, inasmuch as it appears that the judge of the corresponding  military court had given orders for the capture of Cariaga and Resaba, they having been prosecuted  on a criminal charge.  Consequently,  the officers must be acquitted in accordance with the provisions of article 51 of the provisional law for the application of the Penal Code.</p>
<p>For the reasons expressed, therefore, and in view of article 252 of the Penal Code and section 50 of General Orders, No. 58,. the judgment of the court below must be reversed and  Francisco Resaba convicted  and sentenced to one month and one day of <em>arresto mayor</em>, with a fine of 325 pesetas, or to  the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, with accessories, and to the payment of one-seventh part of the costs in both instances, one-half of the time of the preventive imprisonment suffered  to  be computed, the defendants Pablo Unagan, Valentin Dimaano, Gregorio Lat, Mariano Tagle, and Pelagio Unagan to be acquitted, with the remainder of the  costs <em>de oficio.</em>  The order entered in the incident of embargo is approved.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Cooper, Willard,</em> and <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em>Mapa,  J.,</em> did not sit in  this case.</p>
