				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Counsel for petitioner moves for a rehearing, and in support of his motion 
relies more especially upon the provisions of Act No. 2757 of the Philippine 
Legislature, approved February 23, 1918. This Act is as follows:
<p align="center">"[No. 2757.]</p>
<p>"AN ACT TO PENALIZE THE PUBLICATION OF LIBELS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF THE 
PHILIPPINE ISLANDS OR OF THE UNITED STATES DURING THE PRESENT WAR.</p>
<p><em>"Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
Philippines in Legislature assembled and by the authority of the same:</em></p>
<p>"Section 1. It shall be unlawful to print, publish or circulate articles, 
manuscripts, engravings, or caricatures directly or indirectly creating 
sentiments favorable to the cause of the nations with which the United States is 
at war, or redounding to the contempt or dishonor of the Government of the 
Philippine Islands or of the United States, or tending to create obstacles for 
said Governments in the successful prosecution of the present war in favor of 
the United States.</p>
<p>"Sec. 2. Any person violating any of the provisions of this Act shall be 
punished by a fine of not to exceed two thousand pesos or by imprisonment for 
not less than one year, or both. In case the offender is a subject of a neutral 
foreign nation, the Governor-General may, besides, order him deported after 
service by the accused of the penalty imposed upon him.</p>
<p>"Sec. 3. This Act shall take effect on its approval and shall continue in 
force until the sixteenth day of October next following the date on which the 
President of the United States shall proclaim that peace has been reestablished 
between the United States and Germany and her allies.</p>
<p>"Approved, February 23, 1918."</p>
<p>In explanation of his failure to invite the attention of the court to the 
provisions of this statute when the case was submitted for judgment, counsel for 
the petitioner informs us that he first learned of its enactment on the day 
following the promulgation of our decision; and he asserts that although it may 
have been published and circulated in pamphlet form, it had not appeared in any 
publication of general circulation prior to that date.</p>
<p>The contention of counsel would seem to be:</p>
<p>(1) That the express grant of power to deport subjects of neutral foreign 
nations under the conditions indicated in the statute, carries with it an 
implied negation of the right to deport aliens under any other conditions 
whatever, and, especially, to deport alien subjects of allied nations.</p>
<p>(2) That the express grant of power to deport certain specifically defined 
classes of aliens under Act No. 2757, discloses the belief of the legislature, 
itself, that the Governor-General had no power, theretofore, to deport such 
aliens under the provisions of section 69 of the Administrative Code of 
1917.</p>
<p>These contentions seem to overlook the fact that the statute is manifestly a 
war measure granting extraordinary powers during the period of war; and that its 
provisions touching the deportation of neutral aliens are not inconsistent with 
the exercise of the regulated power by the Governor-General to deport aliens 
under the provisions of section 69 of the Administrative Code.</p>
<p>The manifest purpose and object of the deportation provisions of the statute 
is merely to authorize the Governor- General, in his discretion, to order the 
deportation of a subject of a neutral foreign nation without holding an 
investigation of the ground upon which his action is based, under the terms of 
section 69 of the Administrative Code, where it appears that such person has 
been convicted of any of the crimes denned and penalized in the statute: such 
investigation having been rendered unnecessary by the opportunity given the 
convict to be heard and to defend himself in the course of his trial, prior to 
his conviction, in a court of competent jurisdiction. Clearly, there is no 
ground for a contention that this grant of power to the Governor-General, during 
the period of the war, to order the summary deportation of certain aliens, after 
their conviction in a court of law, without prior investigation, was intended to 
have the effect of repealing by implication the regulated power theretofore 
conferred upon him to deport aliens, upon prior investigation conducted in the 
manner and form prescribed in section 69 of the Administrative Code.</p>
<p>We are not advised as to the reasons which induced the Legislature to limit 
the application of the deportation provisions of the Act to subjects of neutral 
foreign nations, though it may be that this was due, as suggested by counsel for 
the petitioner, to the fear that a provision looking to the summary deportation 
from the Philippines of subjects of allied or enemy foreign nations might 
conflict with the terms of some treaty of alliance between the United States and 
her allies, or with the measures adopted by the United States looking to the 
internment or imprisonment of dangerous subjects of enemy countries.</p>
<p>But whatever may have been the reason which controlled the action of the 
Legislature in this regard, we find no conflict between the provisions of Act 
No. 2757, looking to the summary deportation of convict subjects of neutral 
foreign nations, and the provisions of section 69 of the Code conferring a 
regulated authority upon the Governor- General to deport aliens as an act of 
state, upon investigation conducted in the manner and form prescribed in that 
section. Certainly, the Act does not <em>deprive</em> the Governor-General of 
any power he may have had, prior to its enactment, to deport aliens other than 
those mentioned therein.</p>
<p>As to the contention that the express grant of power to deport certain 
aliens, contained in Act No. 2757, demonstrates that the Legislature itself did 
not believe that power was conferred upon the Governor-General to deport aliens 
under the provisions of section 69 of the Administrative Code, and that this 
court should not place a construction on that statute other than that given to 
it by the lawmaker himself, it is to be observed.</p>
<p>(1) That under our system of government the duty and ultimate power to 
construe the laws is vested in the judicial department, just as the duty and 
ultimate power to make the laws is vested in the legislative department. So that 
even if it were true, which we do not admit, that the provisions of Act No. 2757 
disclose that the legislative body which enacted it was of opinion that prior 
thereto the Governor-General had no authority under the law to deport aliens, we 
should not be bound thereby. (Sutherland on Statutory Construction, 2d. Ed., 
Vol. II, par. 358, and many cases there cited in support of the doctrine.)</p>
<p>(2) The enactment of the deportation provisions of Act No. 2757 does not 
justify the assumption of counsel that the legislator himself was of opinion 
that the Governor-General is not authorized under the provisions of section 69 
of the Administrative Code to deport aliens on prior investigation conducted in 
the manner and form therein indicated. No such inference can legitimately be 
drawn from the express grant in Act No. 2757 of temporary authority, as a war 
measure, to deport summarily, and without holding the investigation prescribed 
in the code, subjects of a neutral foreign power who have been convicted of any 
of the offenses defined and penalized therein. The express grant of power to 
deport such convicts without holding a prior investigation discloses merely the 
.legislative belief, that after conviction in a court of law wherein the accused 
is given every opportunity to be heard and to defend himself, a further 
investigation by the Governor-General upon the question of his deportation will, 
in most instances, be unnecessary, and that the summary deportation of such 
convicts as a war measure may be of prime importance in the interests of the 
state.</p>
<p>Even if it were admitted that the legislator had some doubt as to whether 
lawful authority had been conferred upon the Governor-General to deport aliens 
under congressional or focal legislation prior" to the enactment of Act No. 
2757; and that confronted by the urgent or threatened necessity for the exercise 
of such power in certain cases arising during the war, he deemed it prudent to 
remove all occasion for doubts by an express grant of power in such cases; the 
existence of such doubts in the mind of the legislator as to the meaning and 
effect of the provisions of the statutes enacted by himself or his predecessors, 
should not be permitted to have controlling, or even persuasive influence with 
the courts when called upon to interpret and construe such legislative 
provisions.</p>
<p>The motion for a rehearing should be and is denied.</p>

<p align="center"><em><strong>CONCURRING OPINION</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>MALCOLM</strong>, and <strong>FISHER, JJ.</strong>, 
<em>concurring:</em></p>
<p>Petitioner moves for reconsideration bringing to our attention Act No. 2757, 
reading as follows:</p>
<p>"Section 1. It shall be unlawful to print, publish or circulate articles, 
manuscripts, engravings or caricatures directly or indirectly creating 
sentiments favorable to the cause of the nations with which the United States is 
at war, or redounding to the contempt or dishonor of the Government of the 
Philippine Islands or of the United States, or tending to create obstacles for 
said governments in the successful prosecution of the present war in favor of 
the United States.</p>
<p>"Sec. 2. Any person violating any of the provisions of this Act shall be 
punished by a fine of not to exceed two thousand pesos or by imprisonment for 
not less than one year, or both. In case the offender is a subject of a neutral 
foreign nation, the Governor-General may, besides, order him deported after 
service by the accused of the penalty imposed upon him.</p>
<p>As far as Act No. 2757 affects the case, it merely serves as persuasive 
authority demonstrating that express and explicit legislative authority is 
necessary in order to deport aliens. The sovereign right to deport aliens, the 
Legislature says, is not to be inferred as an act of state in a government of 
derived powers and is not to be implied from a section of the Administrative 
Code regulating but not conferring power. When the Legislature desires such 
power to exist, it will grant it in language as plain as that found in Act No. 
2757. The motion has no merit as based on this ground.</p>
<hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1">

<p align="center"><em><strong>DISSENTING OPINION</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>STREET, J.</strong>, <em>dissenting:</em></p>
<p>As one of the dissenting Justices in this case I take advantage of the 
opportunity afforded by the presentation of a motion for a rehearing briefly to 
express my views on certain important phases of the case, avoiding, so far as 
practicable, a repetition of what has been said in the dissenting opinions of 
Justice Johnson and Justice Malcolm.</p>
<p align="center">I.</p>
<p>The first proposition which we propose to maintain is that the power to 
deport does not inhere in the Governor- General by virtue of his office.</p>
<p>The Governor-General holds his commission from the people of the United 
States. He therefore derives his powers from statutes which embody the 
principles of the American law and reflect the policy and traditions of the 
American people. The President does not exercise any such power as that here 
ascribed to the Governor-General; and no attempt was ever made by Congress to 
bestow such power upon the President, save in a single instance, and this 
episode in American history deserves to be here recorded.</p>
<p>In the year 1798, it may be remembered, war with France seemed imminent; and 
the Federalist party which was then dominant in American politics thought well 
to pass four Acts which have been known in subsequent history as the Alien and 
Sedition Laws. By the Alien Act of June 25, 1798, the President was empowered to 
order out of the country all aliens whom he should judge dangerous to the peace 
and safety of the country and forcibly to deport or imprison any aliens who 
should disregard his order.</p>
<p>This Act expired in 1804, and though President Adams did little or nothing to 
enforce its measures, the statute was criticised by the followers of Thomas 
Jefferson as constituting an infringement of the principles on which the 
Republic was founded. The adverse public sentiment thus engendered was so great 
as to contribute measurably to the downfall of the Federalist party and the 
consequent rise to power of the political force which has been known in 
subsequent history as the Democratic party. The fate of that law and its authors 
is here mentioned in order to show that the idea of deporting aliens by 
executive authority runs directly counter to the most fundamental notions of the 
American people.</p>
<p>It has always been taken for granted both in England and in the United States 
that the stranger who comes within our gates is free to remain unless amenable 
to deportation under the special and express provisions of law. The general 
practice thus favors the right to remain in the chosen domicile, and exportation 
is admitted only in aid of the supervision and control exercised by Congress 
over the subject of immigration. In the whole history of the country no single 
instance can apparently be cited where an alien has been deported against his 
will without the express warrant of law. It is true that several years ago 
Governor-General Forbes deported several Chinese from these Islands ; but the 
deportees soon came back and instituted a civil action against him for damages. 
No further attempt was made by him to exercise his supposed power of deportation 
against them.</p>
<p>The reasons why the American people have always been deeply suspicious of 
laws designed to sanction the expulsion of aliens by executive authority are 
manifold. The early pioneers of America were in great part refugees from 
persecution. When they occupied the American soil they dedicated it to the 
purposes of liberty and determined that America should be an asylum for the 
oppressed of all nations. The character so stamped upon the country has not been 
divested.</p>
<p>Nor should it be supposed that the consideration shown to foreigners by the 
laws of the United States is a mere manifestation of sentiment born of 
conditions peculiar to us. It came to us from England as a heritage from the 
past. The Magna Charta (1215, A. D.) contains provisions restraining the 
authority of the king in dealing with the subjects of foreign powers (arts. 41 
and 42). Merchants in particular were to have free ingress and egress except in 
times of war and were expressly declared to be exempt from unjust exactions. 
This was at a time, be it observed, when feudal barons throughout Europe were 
accustomed to rob and pillage merchants. It is a recognized fact in the 
constitutional history of England that, although anciently the king was supposed 
to have the right to expel aliens, the power fell into disuse at an early day 
and has never been exercised since 1575, A. D., in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. 
(Tasewell-Langmead, English Constitutional History, 5th ed., p. 554, note.)</p>
<p>In other words, under the policy which is at the basis of the institutions 
both of England and the United States, neither the King nor the President 
exercises the power of deporting aliens without the express authority of 
statute. It is believed that the basic principle thus settled should not be 
lightly surrendered in any jurisdiction subject to the sovereignty of the United 
States. History plainly teaches that if the constitutional bulwarks which have 
been erected in the course of centuries are permitted to be worn away under the 
subtle pressure of inherent or implied administrative powers, no effectual 
resistance can ever be interposed to the encroachments of executive 
authority.</p>
<p align="center">II.</p>
<p>The principal question in the case is whether a power to deport was conferred 
on the Governor-General by Act No. 2113 of the Philippine Legislature. It cannot 
be maintained that Act No. 2113 expressly confers upon the Governor-General a 
power to deport; but it is insisted that the Legislature recognized the 
existence of such a power in passing a law to restrain its abuse; and it is 
accordingly argued that the power has been thus created by implication. Several 
weighty reasons suggest themselves to the mind of this writer why such a 
proposition cannot possibly be true.</p>
<p>The process of drawing things out of a statute by implication is merely an 
incident in the process of discovering the legislative intent; and where the 
intention is revealed, no interpretation or construction is admissible which 
contradicts that intention.</p>
<p>The preamble of this statute clearly shows that the Legislature intended to 
strike at a manifestation of executive power which was believed to be a menace 
to "the individual security of all residents of these Islands;" and though it is 
recited, in the preamble, that <em>it had been decided</em> that the 
Governor-General had authority to deport, it is evident that the Legislature 
could not have intended either to create that power or to recognize it except as 
a <em>de facto</em> exercise of authority which should be restrained. As a 
matter of fact the statement concerning what had been decided was only partially 
true, and the recital was therefore apparently based to some extent upon a 
misconception. This would be of no importance if the statute had stated in 
express terms that the Governor-General should have the power in question, for a 
legislative Act cannot be impeached by showing that the legislators misconceived 
the situation with which they were dealing. But when it is attempted to derive 
by implication a power which has not been expressly granted, the recitals of the 
preamble are relevant to show what the real intention was.</p>
<p>It believes human intelligence to suppose that a Legislature which in one 
breath denounced a certain power as dangerous to individual security and in 
another made a law to curb its exercise, intended thereby to create what they 
had denounced. Above all, that a Philippine Legislature, composed almost 
entirely of native Filipinos, intended to recreate from Spanish times and place 
in the hand of a foreign ruler, however benevolent, a power fraught with such 
dangerous possibilities passes belief. The more reasonable supposition is that 
the Legislature intended to regulate the procedure only, leaving the occasions 
for its exercise to be sought in other statutes or perhaps to be defined in 
future laws. In the majority opinion there is one statement with which we 
heartily agree. It is in these words: "The cautious phrasing of the paragraph of 
the preamble which declared that it has been decided that the Governor-General 
has authority to deport foreigners by due process of law quite clearly indicates 
that the lawmakers desired to reserve their own views on that subject." The 
extreme tension which existed in those days between the Philippine Assembly and 
the Chief Executive of the Islands is matter of history.</p>
<p>It will be observed that the power which is supposed to have been conferred 
upon the Governor-General by Act No. 2113 is undefined, since the causes which 
might justify him in deporting an alien are not specified. It results that, if 
this general power exists, he will be the sole judge of the sufficiency of the 
cause for deportation. The mere recognition of the existence of such a power in 
the Governor-General would cause thousands of the inhabitants of these Islands 
instantly to feel that the security of person and property, to the preservation 
of which the honor of the American people is here pledged, had been gravely and 
perhaps irremediably impaired.</p>
<p>A further reason for believing that the power in question was not created by 
implication is this: There are some things which the law does not accept upon 
mere implication. Since the days of the Stuarts at least no person living under 
the common law has, with the approval of the courts, been deprived of life or 
liberty by power created by implication. He who would touch life or liberty is 
required to show the express authority of law. Magna Charta declares that no 
freeman shall be taken or imprisoned or exiled except by the legal judgment of 
his peers or of the law of the land (art. 39). The constitutions of the various 
American States, as well as the Organic Law of these Islands, bring down to our 
own day the force of the term "law of the land" in the phrase "due process of 
law," and the latter expression imports the necessity, not only of a method of 
proceeding, but a law upon which the process can operate.</p>
<p>It is rudimentary in our jurisprudence that statutes authorizing summary 
procedings, i. e., such as are not according to the course of the common law or 
are without the ordinary forms of judicial procedure, are to be strictly 
construed. (36 Cyc, 1189.) Again, a statute in derogation of common law or 
common right is not to be extended beyond the words used by the Legislature; and 
it is said that where a statute not only effects a change in common law but is 
also in derogation of common right, it must be construed with especial 
strictness. (36 Cyc, 1179.) Statutes which operate in restraint of personal 
liberty are of this class.</p>
<p>There are some things which are too fundamental to be expounded; they can 
only be felt; and to be felt they must be imbibed, so to speak, from the 
atmosphere in which one has been nurtured. To the mind of a person indoctrinated 
with the spirit of the common law there must always be the strongest kind of 
bias against the abrogation or impairment of personal security by the mere 
implication or artificial construction of any statute.</p>
<p align="center">III.</p>
<p>If Act No. 2113 did not create a power in the Governor-General to deport, it 
is evident that no such power was created by the incorporation of the substance 
of that Act in section 83 of the Administrative Code of 1916, or its successor, 
section 69 of the Administrative Code of 1917. Section 3 of both these Codes 
defines their relation to prior laws by declaring that such provisions of the 
Code as incorporate prior laws shall be deemed to be made in continuation 
thereof and to be in the nature of amendments thereto, without prejudice to any 
right already accrued. The reenactment of this provision in the two Codes 
therefore raised no additional presumption of a legislative intent to create the 
power. It will be observed that the Administrative Code is chiefly conversant 
with the organization and administration of the Government, and while it defines 
the powers of the different officials so far as general statements concerning 
their powers could be conveniently framed, it is not concerned with defining the 
conditions and rules which protect individuals who come within the orbit of the 
operation of governmental functionaries. As the provision now stands in the Code 
(sec. 69) it must be considered to be of a purely procedural nature.</p>
<p align="center">IV.</p>
<p>As we have already shown the laws of the United States with reference to the 
right of foreigners to reside therein uniformly proceed upon the assumption that 
they are entitled to remain unless subject to deportation under special and 
express provisions of law. The Act of Congress of February 5, 1917, which was 
passed over the Presidential veto, entitled "An Act to regulate the immigration 
of aliens to, and the residence of aliens in, the United States" is the last 
special Act of Congress dealing with the subject of immigration. This Act was 
expressly made applicable to the Philippine Islands (sec. 1) and should be 
construed <em>in pari materia</em> with our own laws. It purports in its title 
to deal with the residence of aliens in American territory; and in the body of 
the Act are found numerous provisions, especially in section 19, denning the 
conditions under which aliens who have come into the country may be lawfully 
deported.</p>
<p>Considering the large purview of this statute and the detailed character of 
the legislation contained in it, the conclusion seems irresistible that Congress 
intended that aliens not deportable under its provisions, or by some other 
statute expressly authorizing deportation, such as the Chinese Exclusion Law, 
should have a right to remain on American territory. Of course if we had upon 
the statute books of the Philippine Islands a law giving the Governor- General 
the express power to deport, this Act of Congress would not have the effect of 
abrogating such law. But the power claimed on behalf of the Governor-General 
under the local statute arises by implication only; and we think the implication 
from the Act of Congress that an alien not deportable under the provisions of 
that, or some other special Act, is entitled to remain in American territory is 
at least as strong as the implication from Act No. 2113 (sec. 69, Admin. Code) 
that the Governor-General may put him out. In Tiaco <em>vs</em>. Forbes (228 U. 
S., 549) Justice Holmes observed that the extension of the Chinese exclusion and 
immigration laws to the Philippine Islands had no bearing on that case; but that 
could only have been said because a special Act (No. 1986) had been passed by 
our legislature which determined the case and made the other statutes 
irrelevant.</p>
<p>Something is said in the majority opinion to the effect that inasmuch as 
section 69 of the Administrative Code was enacted and approved by the President 
after the Act of Congress of February 5, 1917, had already become a law, the 
Code provision last mentioned necessarily superseded anything to the contrary in 
the Act of Congress and restored the law to where it was before the latter Act 
was passed. The trouble, however, is the same as before namely, in getting this 
power out of the Code provision by implication; and in the end the question is, 
as it was in the beginning, on the proper construction to be placed upon section 
69, and the preceding provision in Act No. 2113.</p>
<p align="center">V.</p>
<p>Act No. 2757 of the Philippine Legislature also furnishes confirmatory proof 
of the correctness of the position of the dissenting judges. This Act was passed 
upon February 23, 1918, the same day the Governor-General issued his order for 
an investigation of the charges preferred in this case against the petitioner. 
The Act contains internal evidence that it was drawn in contemplation of the 
very offense which the petitioner is supposed to have committed, namely, 
obstructing the Government in the prosecution of the present war. The statute 
does not say in so many words that the Governor-General shall not exercise a 
power of deportation otherwise than in conformity with this Act; and hence it 
may still be argued that if the general power to deport already existed under 
section 69 of the Administrative Code, it is not taken away by this Act. We do 
not think, however, that this argument quite meets the case. The Act indicates 
that the Legislature thought the situation was one requiring legislative action; 
and the circumstance that the Act makes provision for the deportation of the 
subjects of neutral foreign nation‚Äînot of belligerent foreign nation‚Äî after 
conviction in a court of justice, shows that in the opinion of the Legislature 
the general power to deport was non- existent. It is as if the Legislature had 
been called upon to express its opinion upon the point whether the general power 
to deport existed and had replied in this rescript that it does not. It was 
certainly singular for the Legislature to insert into this Act a special 
provision for the deportation of a certain class of foreigners, after conviction 
in court, if it had been supposed that the Governor-General already had the 
power to deport all. And again we may say, repeating a form of expression 
already used with reference to the Act of Congress of February 5, 1917, the 
implication from Act No. 2757 to the effect that the petitioner may remain in 
the Islands is at least as strong as the implication from section 69 of the 
Administrative Code that the Governor-General may put him out. And any doubt 
that exists should be resolved favorably to the right of individual 
security.</p>
<p align="center">VI.</p>
<p>That we may not be supposed to be advocating a view of the case which, if 
adopted, would expose public interests in these Islands to peril, we will add 
that there are ample provisions upon our statute books under which such 
activities as are charged against the petitioner can be punished and controlled. 
This is obvious not only from the penal provisions of Act No. 2757, but also 
from Act No. 1692 (amendatory of section 8 of Act No. 292) and from subsection 
(<em>b</em>) of section 1954, in relation with subsection (e) of section 2757, 
of the Administrative Code. Under Act No. 1692 any person who publishes a 
writing which tends to disturb the peace of the community or the safety or order 
of the Government is punishable by a fine of four thousand pesos or by 
imprisonment for not exceeding two years or both. Under subsection (<em>b</em>) 
of section 1954 of the Administrative Code all written or printed matter which 
tends to disturb the peace of the community or to stir up the people against the 
lawful authorities is absolutely non-mailable, and any person who deposits such 
matter for carriage in the Philippine mails is subject to a fine of not more 
than three hundred pesos or imprisonment for not more than six months, or both. 
(Admin. Code, sec. 2757-<em>e</em>).</p>
<p align="center">VII.</p>
<p>The prevailing opinion written by Justice Carson in this case, in so far as 
it relates to the source of the power of deportation, will be found to rest on 
three cardinal ideas or propositions which we cull from different parts of the 
opinion and here exhibit in what appears to be their logical order. They are 
these:</p>
<p>"1. We think that an examination of the history of the office of the Chief 
Executive in these Islands under American sovereignty will disclose that, until 
and unless he is deprived of such authority by some Act of Congress or of the 
Philippine Legislature, the power of the Philippine Government to deport aliens 
as an act of state is vested in the Governor-General by virtue of his office, 
subject only to the regulations prescribed in section 69 of the Administrative 
Code of 1917, or by future legislation on the subject.</p>
<p>"2. We are well satisfied, also, that under American sovereignty, the 
essentially civil power to deport aliens as an act of state was originally 
vested in the Military Governor and thereafter in the first Civil Governor; and 
that it has continued in the office of the Chief Executive, the 
Governor-General, ever since, except in so far as his power has been restricted, 
limited, or controlled by the various acts of the Philippine Legislature to 
which reference has already been made.</p>
<p>"3. The Governor-General of the Philippine Islands has power to deport 
aliens, as an act of state, upon prior investigation conducted in the manner and 
form prescribed in section 69 of the Administrative Code."</p>
<p>In all of these statements there appears a factor which to some extent 
envelops the meaning in obscurity. This is found in the phrase "act of state." 
As the term is used by Justice Carson it is evidently intended to admonish us 
that we are here confronted with a manifestation of power of so exalted a type 
as to be beyond the range of judicial scrutiny. We submit that the expression 
has little or no relevancy to the present discussion and that the suggestion 
intended to be conveyed by it has no support in legal authority. The mere 
circumstance that an act is an act of state (i. e. an act exerted by a 
government against the subject of a foreign power), by no means makes' it valid, 
when directly attacked upon writ of habeas corpus, if it is in fact 
unauthorized.</p>
<p>The term "act of state" is used by the English Courts to indicate the 
immunity from civil liability which is enjoyed by the crown, the officers of 
state, and their agents, in respect to damage which may be done to aliens in 
exercising certain governmental powers. (Street, Foundations of Legal Liability, 
Vol. I, pp. 36, 37.) The peculiar doctrine indicated by this term has been 
frequently applied in cases arising in India between British subjects acting 
under authority of the Indian Government and citizens of the independent States. 
(See "Act of State as Applied to the Government of India," by C. P. Ilbert, I 
Eng. Rul. Cas., 821 <em>et seq</em>.) By virtue of this doctrine it is held that 
a state official, or person acting under orders from him, is not liable for the 
damage inflicted by an act of state on the subject of a foreign power even 
though the act which causes such damage is unauthorized by law.</p>
<p>The doctrine in question has rarely been the subject of discussion in 
American decisions; but the idea came within the ken of the Supreme Court of the 
United States in the case of Tiaco <em>vs</em>. Forbes (228 U. S., 549; 57 L. 
ed., 967). This as has been stated, was a civil action to recover damages 
brought in the courts of the Philippine Islands by certain Chinese who alleged 
that they had been unlawfully deported. In order to protect the Governor-General 
from the possible consequences of this deportation the Philippine Legislature by 
a special Act ratified and confirmed his action. (Act No. 1986.) The Supreme 
Court of the United States held, affirming the decision of this court, that the 
action for damages could not be maintained. The decision was chiefly based on 
the effect of the curative Act; and the court expressly refrained from deciding 
whether the Governor-General would have been protected in that case without the 
aid of the statute, on the ground of an immunity enjoyed by him in the exercise 
of powers of state. The case at bar is wholly different. Here the authority of 
the Governor-General to make the order of deportation is directly attacked on a 
writ of habeas corpus, and the question is simply whether the Governor-General 
has the power to deport‚Äînot whether he would be civilly liable in damages for 
the consequences of that Act, supposing it to be illegal.</p>
<p>The doctrine indicated by the term "act of state" is a shield, or weapon of 
defense, for the state official‚Äînot a magical device for enduing him with 
power.</p>
<p>Something must now in turn be said concerning each of the three propositions 
above quoted by us from the prevailing opinion.</p>
<p>The first statement to the effect that the power to deport is vested in the 
Governor-General by virtue of his office and may be exercised by him except as 
he is deprived of such authority by Act of Congress or of the Philippine 
Legislature is wholly mistaken. The exact converse is true, namely, that there 
is no such power vested in the Governor-General by virtue of his office, and he 
has only such power in this respect as is conferred by Act of Congress or of the 
Philippine Legislature.</p>
<p>No person has had the temerity to argue or assert in this court that the 
Governor-General under American sovereignty has inherited the power to deport 
which was conferred on the Spanish Governor-General by royal orders of the King 
of Spain. It is accepted by all that that power was of a political nature and 
vanish with the change of sovereignty.</p>
<p>As we have already shown, the political and constitutional history of our own 
country affords no support for proposition that such a power exists, and that it 
did not exist is also clearly demonstrated in the dissenting opinion of Mr. 
Justice Malcolm in this case. It is absolutely inconsistent with the law and 
practice of our Government from the beginning.</p>
<p>But because there was once a Military Governor here who was charged with the 
duty of pacifying an insurrection the whole order of things is supposed to have 
been changed. In the case of Forbes <em>vs</em>. Chuoco Tiaco and Crossfleld (16 
Phil. Rep., 534), three of the Justices of this court signed an opinion which 
was in part based on the idea of the existence of such a power in the 
Governor-General; but that notion was impliedly repudiated by the Supreme Court 
of the United States upon appeal and is no longer sustained by the Justice of 
this court who wrote the opinion signed by three in that case. It should be 
permitted to pass into history like the memory of an evil dream.</p>
<p>The second proposition is closely connected with the first. It is as thin and 
as nicely spun as a cobweb and equally fragile. The idea is that the Military 
Governor had the right to deport aliens, but that <em>in his hands it was an 
essentially civil power</em>. Being a civil power, it was naturally inherited by 
the Civil Governor, who succeeded, or superseded, the Military Governor; and it 
therefore passed ultimately to the Governor-General. (Be it observed that if it 
had been admitted that it was a military power, it could not have been argued 
that the Civil Governor had inherited it). Subtleties such as these awaken no 
response in the consciousness. If the Military Governor had wanted to deport an 
alien of course he would Have done it; but in doing so he would have been acting 
under the authority of the President of the United States as Commander in Chief 
of the American Army. Something has been said of the Spooner Amendment of March 
2, 1901. Anybody who reads it with a detached mind will see that it was a purely 
transitory provision and that it speaks of the past. There never was, of course, 
any Presidential order or statute of any sort, created by American authority, 
which expressly gave the power to deport to anybody.</p>
<p>The third proposition which we have quoted from the prevailing opinion is 
somewhat more inclusive and requires more careful examination. It is supposed to 
have two legs upon either of which, or both, it can rest at will. We quote from 
that portion of the opinion in which this phenomenon is elucidated.</p>
<p>"It is not necessary, at this time, to determine whether, under the various 
organic acts of the Philippine Government, the power to deport aliens, as an act 
of state, is vested in the Governor-General 'by virtue of his office alone,' 
subject merely to regulation by the Philippine Legislature ; or whether his 
authority in the premises is derived wholly from the Philippine Legislature by 
virtue of a grant of power, express or implied, in section 69 of the 
Administrative Code of 1917; because deportations of aliens by the 
Governor-General, as an act of state, upon prior investigation conducted in the 
manner and form prescribed in section 69 of the Administrative Code may properly 
be regarded as made 'under the combined powers' of the Governor-General and the 
Philippine Legislature; authority for such deportations having been conferred 
upon the Governor-General, so far as that may be necessary, by the provisions of 
that section, as we believe and shall endeavor to show hereafter."</p>
<p>We submit that the proof rather doubtfully promised in the closing words of 
this paragraph is not forthcoming and cannot be produced. The author of the 
opinion, it is true, glides off smoothly into a quotation from the decision of 
the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Tiaco vs. Forbes (228 U. 
S., 549) which seems superficially to give some countenance to his 
generalization, but which on examination falls far short of meeting the 
exigency. The truth is Justice Carson has put a strain upon the decision of the 
Supreme Court of the United States which it cannot bear.</p>
<p>In Tiaco <em>vs</em>. Forbes the Legislature of the Philippine Islands had 
passed a special Act (No. 1986) after the deportation had been effected, 
ratifying it in all respects. Justice Holmes, delivering the opinion of the 
court, considered that this curative statute operated with the same legal effect 
as if there had been an antecedent express authority from the Legislature to 
make the deportation in question. The legislative authority therefore 
unquestionably existed; and the Governor-General, as Chief Executive, had acted 
in pursuance of that authority. It was therefore entirely correct to say, as 
Justice Holmes said, simply and as we think without any occult meaning, that the 
deportation was effected under the combined powers of the Legislature and of the 
Governor-General, that is, the power of the Legislature to direct and of the 
Governor-General to execute. In the present case the Governor-General stands 
ready to execute; but the question to be decided is; Has the legislative 
authority been granted? Justice Carson in forming his combination in this case, 
so as to give to the deportation the support of "the combined powers of the 
Governor-General and of the Philippine Legislature," has overlooked the 
important fact that, where two integral members are essential to a combination, 
the combination is worthless unless both members will function. A chain is no 
stronger that its weakest link. The opinion of the Supreme Court of the United 
States, to which reference has been made, does not give the slightest support to 
the position assumed by this court; and if the prevailing opinion is sound, it 
must rest upon the validity of the interpretation placed by the majority upon 
section 69 of the Administrative Code. Our reasons for believing that the 
interpretation of that provision adopted by them is erroneous have already been 
expressed.</p>
<p align="center">VIII.</p>
<p>It remains to say a few words about the case of Chan Yick Sam <em>vs</em>. 
Prosecuting Attorney of Manila (31 Phil. Rep., 560), upon which much reliance is 
apparently placed in the prevailing opinion as authority for the proposition 
that Act No, 2113 furnished full and lawful authority to the Governor-General to 
proceed to deport a foreigner upon grounds satisfactory to himself. We do not so 
regard it. The only point actually decided in that case was that a writ of 
prohibition would not lie to restrain a person, acting under orders from the 
Governor-General, from holding an investigation in conformity with the procedure 
prescribed in that Act. No attempt had been made to deprive the petitioner of 
his liberty or to deport him, and no attempt had even been made to compel him to 
appear before the agent. The result of the investigation might have been 
favorable to the petitioner or, if adverse, the Governor- General might have 
decided that he had no authority to deport him, in either of which events the 
mere holding of the inquiry which he was seeking to restrain would not have 
injuriously affected any right of the petitioner.</p>
<p>Nobody has here questioned the authority of the Governor-General to appoint 
an agent to conduct an investigation under section 69 of the Administrative Code 
(see also section 71 of same Code); and if such an investigation should reveal a 
statutory ground for deportation, the Governor-General would be the proper 
official to make it. For instance, a person judicially convicted of a violation 
of section 2 of Act No. 2381 (the Opium Law) and sentenced to deportation as a 
recidivist might by eluding the vigilance of the authorities reenter the 
Islands. By the Jones Law (Act of Congress of August 29, 1916) the 
Governor-General is made directly responsible for the faithful execution of the 
laws of the Philippine Islands and of the United States operative therein. He 
would therefore have the power, if he should see fit, to proceed under section 
69 in effecting a second deportation of the convicted person. A careful gleaning 
of our statutes would undoubtedly reveal other situations which would support 
similar administrative proceedings under the same section; and if any defect 
should be revealed in the machinery for the enforcement of the immigrating or 
Chinese exclusion law, recourse might be of course had to the same provision, as 
supplying an appropriate procedure.</p>
<p>This is mentioned not only for the purpose of showing that a writ of 
prohibition, really an injunction, could not be properly issued against an agent 
conducting an investigation for the Governor-General, but also to indicate that 
even as section 69 now stands in the Administrative Code, and considered simply 
as a procedural provision, there are already upon our books provisions 
authorizing deportation which can be carried into effect in the manner 
prescribed by that section.</p>
<p>It is not improbable that the Justices who concurred in the opinion in the 
Chan Yick Sam case were then of the opinion that the Governor-General had 
authority under Act No. 2113 to deport the petitioner and regarded the 
proceedings of which complaint was made as a proper preliminary to the exercise 
of that power; but nothing actually stated in the opinion expresses that belief. 
Certainly we do not regard a mere inference as to the existence of such a power 
to be binding upon this court as a precedent in a matter of such vital 
importance. It is evident, from the brevity of the opinion and the failure 
definitely to determine the grounds upon which it was to be supported, that it 
was accorded but a scanty consideration‚Äîdoubtless quite sufficient to warrant 
the conclusion that prohibition would not lie in that particular case, but 
wholly insufficient to justify the engrafting upon our jurisprudence of the 
doctrine which it is supposed to establish by inference.</p>
<p align="center">IX.</p>
<p>The conclusion in my opinion is that the Governor-General has no power to 
deport the petitioner upon the facts appearing of record, that the petitioner 
should have been set at liberty upon the original hearing before this court, and 
that consequently the motion for a rehearing 3hould now be granted and the 
former judgment reversed,‚Äî not exclusively on the special ground stated in the 
motion to rehear, but on the ground that the original judgment is fundamentally 
erroneous.</p>

<p align="center"><em><strong>DISSENTING OPINION</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>FISHER, J.</strong>, <em>dissenting:</em></p>
<p>I concur in the dissenting opinion of Justices Johnson, Malcolm, and Street. 
I think it proper to add, however, to what has been said by them, that to my 
mind the most important effect of the decision in this case is the definite 
abandonment by this court of the doctrine of the "inherent power" of the 
Governor-General to deport aliens. This is clearly shown by the statement in the 
majority opinion that the concurring Justices are "of opinion that by the 
enactment of the series of statutes just cited the Philippine Legislature 
<em>conferred</em> upon the Governor-General authority to deport subjects of 
foreign powers * * *."</p>
<p>Recognition of the fact that the <em>Legislature</em> is the repository of 
the power to expel or exclude aliens is frequently repeated in the majority 
opinion. It is true that after exhaustively stating the grounds for the opinion 
that the <em>Legislature</em> intended to confer and <em>did</em> confer the 
power under consideration it is said that "an examination of the history of the 
office of the Chief Executive in these Islands under American sovereignty will 
disclose that until and unless he is <em>deprived</em> of such authority by some 
act of Congress <em>or of the Philippine Legislature</em> the power <em>of the 
Philippine Government</em> to deport aliens as an act of state is vested in the 
Governor-General by virtue of his office. * * *."</p>
<p>I am of the opinion that neither the statutes cited nor the historical 
antecedent invoked justify the conclusions which the majority draw from them, 
but I rejoice to know that those conclusions rest the power to deport aliens 
upon a <em>grant</em> of power from the Philippine Legislature or the 
<em>acquiescence</em> of that body in its exercise and not upon the pernicious 
and utterly undemocratic doctrine of the "inherent powers" of the Executive.</p>
<p>If the extraordinary powers with which the majority conceive the 
Governor-General to be invested are derived from rules of law enacted by the 
Philippine Legislature or over which it has the power of repeal that body may, 
by the repeal or amendment of those rules, withdraw or modify that power. If the 
authority has been <em>conferred</em> by the Philippine Legislature, or although 
derived from some other source, may be <em>withdrawn</em> by it, the full 
responsibility for its existence rests, as it should, directly upon the 
Legislature, as the immediate source‚Äîby grant or by acquiescence‚Äîof that 
authority, and indirectly upon the electorate to which the Legislature is 
accountable for all its acts or omissions.</p>
<p>An oppressive or unwise statute may for a time be endured with fortitude, for 
the injustices resulting from its enforcement are certain, in the end, to bring 
about its repeal ; but an "inherent" executive power, above the law and the very 
source of law, would be bound, by its very nature, to cause the keenest 
apprehension on the part of those exposed to its action, regardless of the 
integrity and honesty of the official in whom that power might be vested. To 
destroy every vestige of such power and to subject every officer of the 
Government, from the highest to the lowest, to the rule of law, has been the 
purpose of democracy from the birth of the idea to the present day. In no 
country has the attainment of that object been more earnestly sought than in the 
United States. It would, indeed, be strange were the United States to leave as a 
legacy to this new democracy of the Orient, the false doctrine that the rule of 
the people is compatible with the existence of an executive office whose 
incumbent is vested with "inherent" powers beyond their control.</p>
<p>The reasons for my dissent are principally that the majority opinion assumes 
not only that it is to be <em>inferred</em> that by the enactment of section 69 
of the Administrative Code and its antecedent statutes the Legislature intended 
to confer upon the Governor-General the unrestricted power to deport aliens, but 
that it may lawfully delegate to him such authority. I say "unrestricted" power, 
because while section 69 requires that certain formalities be complied with 
before the obnoxious alien may be deported, those formalities afford no 
protection whatever. Of what does it avail that the alien is to be given a 
hearing, to be informed of the charges against him, to have counsel, and .to 
produce witnesses, if there is no <em>rule</em> by which to determine the legal 
effect of the answer which he may make to the charges ? It is a useless and vain 
formality, to require that the alien shall be heard before he is expelled, if 
the expulsion may take place regardless of anything he may say. I maintain that 
the mere formality of a hearing is not in itself sufficient to constitute due 
process of law. The requirement of due process in such cases implies not only a 
hearing, but a rule of <em>law</em> defining the standard of conduct for the 
violation of which the right of residence and asylum which aliens enjoy under 
our statutes is to be forfeited. As was said by the Supreme Court of the United 
States in the Japanese Immigrant Case (189 U. S., 100):</p>
<p>"This court has never held, nor must we now be understood as holding, that 
administrative officers, when executing the provisions of a statute involving 
the liberty of persons, may disregard the fundamental principles that inhere in 
'due process of law' a¬£ understood at the time of the adoption of the 
Constitution. One of these principles is that no person shall be deprived of his 
liberty without opportunity, at some time, to be heard before such officers, 
<em>in respect of the matters upon which that liberty depends</em>, * * *."</p>
<p>It is not enough that they be given an opportunity to be <em>heard</em> 
before being deprived of their liberty‚Äîthat alone would be a vain formality‚Äîbut 
they must be heard <em>"in respect of the matters upon which that liberty 
depends."</em> By whom is to be determined for what matters that liberty may be 
forfeited? I answer unhesitatingly, by the Legislature. Law is essentially, a 
rule of conduct, prescribed by the law-making power. An alien is or is not 
obnoxious according to his adherence to or departure from the course of conduct 
prescribed by the rule. Under the various Acts of Congress and of the Philippine 
Legislature which expressly authorize the deportation of aliens, the conduct 
required of them is made known by the prohibition of certain acts, the doing of 
which renders them liable to expulsion, after a hearing upon the issue of the 
commission of the acts which produce the forfeiture of the right of 
residence‚Äî<em>"in respect of the matters upon which the liberty 
depends"</em></p>
<p>I am, therefore, of the opinion that if the Philippine Legislature‚Äîwith the 
approval of the President, as required by the Jones Law with respect to acts 
which "<em>affect</em>" immigration‚Äîhad, in so many words, attempted to confer 
upon the Governor-General the unrestricted discretionary power to deport aliens, 
after such a hearing, whenever he might deem it proper to do so, such a statute 
would be void as being obnoxious to the requirement of due process of law. 
Furthermore", it would, in my judgment, be invalid as an attempt to delegate to 
him power of a legislative nature. The determination of the rules of conduct by 
which the inhabitants of our Territory are to be governed is a function 
essentially legislative in character. The Legislature may delegate to an 
executive the authority to ascertain the existence of the facts upon which the 
application of the rule of law depends, but not the authority to create the rule 
for each particular case, apply it, and enforce his judgment.</p>
<p>It is significant that it was in a case involving the rights a Chinese alien 
(Yick Wo <em>vs</em>. Hopkins, 118 U. S., 356) that our highest court thus 
epitomized the essence of that system of government which we are striving to 
maintain for ourselves and which we hope the people of these Islands will 
forever retain as the best gift we can bestow upon them:</p>
<p>"When we consider the nature and the theory of our institutions ot 
government, the principles upon which they are supposed to rest, and review the 
history of their development, we are constrained to conclude that they do not 
mean to leave the r,oom for the play and action of purely personal and arbitrary 
power. Sovereignty itself is, of course, not subject to law, for it is the 
author and source of law; but in our system, while sovereign powers are 
delegated to the agencies of government, sovereignty itself remains with the 
people, by whom and for whom all government exists and acts. And the law is the 
definition and limitation of power. It is, indeed, quite true, that there must 
always be lodged somewhere, and in some person or body, the authority of final 
decision; and, in many cases of mere administration the responsibility is purely 
political, no appeal lying except to the ultimate tribunal of the public 
judgment, exercised either in the pressure of opinion or by means of the 
suffrage. But the fundamental rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of 
happiness, considered as individual possessions, are secured by those maxims of 
constitutional law which are the monuments showing the victorious progress of 
the race in securing to men the blessings of civilization under the reign of 
just and equal laws, so that, in the famous language of the Massachusetts Bill 
of Rights, the government of the commonwealth 'may be a government of laws and 
not of men.' For, the very idea that one man may be compelled to hold his life, 
or the means of living, or any material right essential to the enjoyment of 
life, at the mere will of another, seems to be intolerable in any country where 
freedom prevails, as being the essence of slavery itself."</p></div>
