				<H3>IN RE W. H. BOORAM. SUSPENSION AS ATTORNEY-AT-LAW.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MOIR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">A complaint of unprofessional conduct against W. H. Booram, an attorney of 
this court, was presented by A. T. Hashim on December 5th, 1916. This complaint 
was forwarded to the Attorney-General of the Philippine Islands who investigated 
the same, and in a report dated July 9th, 1917, recommended that the said 
attorney be suspended from the practice of the law, in accordance with section 
21 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
<p>The evidence was taken by a commissioner appointed by this court to which 
commissioner later the said Booram objected. But in view of his answer and the 
exhibits filed in this case, it is considered that there is no need for passing 
upon his objections to the hearing before the commissioner.</p>
<p>It appears from the record that A. T. Hashim had an account against one 
Antonio Villeta, a tailor of this city, for the sum of P265.17 which was placed 
in the hands of Booram for collection. The sum of P40 in cash was collected, and 
he collected by means of clothing made for him by the said Villeta the sum of 
P92.58, making a total of just one-half of the account of Hashim against 
Villeta.</p>
<p>On November 22, 1916, Booram and Mahoney by W. H. Booram, attorneys, made the 
following return to Hashim, as appears from Exhibit H.</p>
<blockquote><p align="right"><em>"November 22, 1916.</em></p>
<p>"The Hashim Commercial &amp; Trading Co. Ltd.,<br>"Dr. to Booram and 
Mahoney.</p>

<p>"To attorney fees vs. A. Villeta 50 per cent of 
P265.17............................................................ 
<u>P132.58</u></p>
<p>"Collected from A. Villeta and applied on 
fee............................................................. P132.58</p>
<p align="right">"Booram and Mahoney,<br>"By (sgd.) W. H. Booram."</p></blockquote>
<p>There is no dispute about this fact. The fee which Booram charged for 
collecting the account against Villeta was the whole amount collected, though 
only half of the original claim.</p>
<p>Booram in his written answer makes no satisfactory explanation of this 
transaction. He pretends that Hashim owed him for former legal work, but this 
does not excuse his receiving an account for P265.17 and collecting half of 
that account from the debtor, and claiming all the money collected as his fee 
for the work done in that case. Nor does the evidence sustain his defense that 
he had done other work for Hashim for which he had not been paid.</p>
<p>We are of the opinion, and so hold, that this conduct on the part of W. H. 
Booram, an attorney of this court, was unprofessional and unethical, and that 
the recommendation of the Attorney-General that he should be suspended from the 
practice of the law is a proper recommendation, and should be granted.</p>
<p>Wherefore, it is adjudged, ordered and decreed that the said W. H. Booram be 
and he is hereby suspended as an attorney-at-law in the Philippine Islands for a 
period of two years from this date. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson, Carson, Araullo, Street,</em> and 
<em>Avance√±a, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Malcolm, J.</em>, did not take part.</p></div>
