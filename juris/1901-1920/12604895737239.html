				<BR><STRONG>LADD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> The offense of which the defendant has been convicted is that termed <em>abusos deshonestos</em>, defined in  article 439 of the Code.  There appears to be no dispute as to the facts. The prosecuting witness,  Saturnina Emiterio, owed the defendant, who was the president of  the  pueblo, a peso. The defendant sent several policemen to her house to arrest her.  They brought  her to  the defendant's house, where, after beating her with a stick, the defendant compelled her to take off all her clothes and dance before himself and many oilier persons.  Further details of  what  occurred are related  by the witnesses, but it is  not necessary  to state them.</p>
<p> It is  claimed by counsel for  the  defendant that  these facts do not show the commission of the offense of <em>abusos deshonestos</em>, because the defendant was  actuated in what he did not by libidinous motives but by the desire to punish the prosecuting witness for not returning the peso.</p>
<p> We need not determine  the abstract  question whether in a cast; where the sole motive of acts such as those under consideration appeared to be anger, curiosity, or the like, this particular crime of <em>abusos deshonestos</em> could be said to be committed.   We can not so interpret  the facts of the present case.   It  appears  to have been assumed by the court below in  its judgment that the defendant's purpose was to take revenge  upon the prosecuting witness for her failure to pay him, and that may doubtless have been one motive, and it may even be admitted that it was the dominating  motive of his conduct.  Still  we can not believe that there was no  admixture  of  lasciviousness in the thoughts and purposes of a man avIio could devise such a method as this  defendant did to exact satisfaction from a woman for the nonpayment of a debt.  And we are therefore of opinion that, even if the facts are to be viewed from a subjective as well as an objective standpoint, the offense of <em>abusos deshonestos </em>may properly  be predicated upon them.</p>
<p> It is further claimed by counsel for the defendant that the fact that the complaint was not sworn to by the prosecuting witness vitiates  all  the  proceedings.   Without considering what might  be  the consequences of such  a defect in the complaint if neither cured nor waived, it is sufficient to say that  here the defect was both cured and waivedâ€”waived because  no  objection was  taken at  the trial,  and  cured  because  the  complaint,  having been adopted by the  provincial fiscal in a writing signed by him  and filed in court, may  be  regarded  for all material purposes as an information under General Orders, No. 58, section 6.<br>
  <br>
  The judgment is affirmed with costs, and the cause will be returned to the court below  for the execution of such judgment.  So ordered.</p>
<p> <em>Arellano, C. J., Cooper, Willard,</em> and <em>Mapa, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p>  <em>Torres, J.,</em> did not sit in this  case.</p>
