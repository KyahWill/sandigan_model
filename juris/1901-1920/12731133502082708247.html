</div><p>These are appeals from decisions of the Court of First Instance of the 
Province of Rizal finding the accused guilty—(1) R. G. No. 13352 for a violation 
of a municipal ordinance of Caloocan and sentencing him to pay a fine of P30, 
with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency; (2) R. G. No. 13353 for a 
violation of the Internal Revenue Law and sentencing him to pay a fine of P200, 
with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency; (3) R. G. No. 13354 for a 
violation of the Internal Revenue Law and sentencing him to pay a fine of P10, 
with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and pay the license-tax of 
P5; (4) R. G. No. 13355 for a violation of the Internal Revenue Law and 
sentencing him to pay a fine of P200, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of 
insolvency, and pay the license-tax of P5; and to pay the costs in each 
instance.</p>
<p>It was agreed by the accused and the fiscal that the evidence taken in case 
R. G. No. 13354 be considered as also taken in cases Nos. 13355 and 13353, as 
the facts were the same in each case.</p>
<p>In case No. 13352, it was agreed and stipulated that this case (R. G. No. 
13352) be tried together with the other three cases, namely, R. G. No.' 13353, 
R. G. No. 13354, and R. G. No. 13355. At the same time the accused, after having 
the demurrer filed by him overruled, stated: "Estoy enterado de las querellas. 
Admito Ios hechos alegados en todas las querellas, y solamente sostengo la 
cuestion legal de que no soy culpable bajo la ley." (I am informed of the 
complaints. I admit all the allegations in the complaint; I maintain only that 
under the law I am not guilty.)</p>
<p>The original complaint filed before the justice of the peace in R. G. No. 
13352, alleges:</p>
<p>"That the said Sandalio J. Rodriguez, the accused above-mentioned, during the 
months of January, February, and March, 1916, in the municipality of Caloocan, 
Province of Rizal, P. I., did, then and there, willfully and unlawfully, open, 
maintain, exploit, and run publicly, a dancing hall named 'Esperanza' in the 
<em>sitio</em> of Meypajo, within this jurisdiction, where the general public is 
admitted, without having paid into the municipal treasury of this municipality 
the sum of P225 as a municipal tax corresponding to the first quarter of 1916, 
that is, the months of January, February, and March above indicated; and 
contrary to the ordinance in this matter, of said municipality, duly approved 
and promulgated."</p>
<p>When the case was appealed to the Court of First Instance, the fiscal filed 
an information which alleges:</p>
<p>"That the said Sandalio J. Rodriguez, the accused, during the months of 
January, February, and March, 1916, in the municipality of Caloocan, Province of 
Rizal, P. I., did, then and there, wilfully, maliciously, and unlawfully, as 
owner and manager of a dancing hall named 'Esperanza,' exploit and open to the 
public said dancing hall without having paid into the municipal treasury the 
municipal tax of P225 corresponding to the first quarter of 1916.</p>
<p>"Act committed in violation of the ordinance above cited."</p>
<p>The information filed in case R. G. No. 13353 alleges:</p>
<p>"That the said Sandalio J. Rodriguez, the accused, on December 15, 1915, in 
the municipality of Caloocan, Province of Rizal, P. I., did, then and there, 
wilfully, maliciously, and unlawfully, engage in the business of selling cured 
tobacco at retail, without having previously paid the internal revenue 
license-tax corresponding to the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>"Act committed in violation of law."</p>
<p>The information filed in case R. G. No. 13354 alleges:</p>
<p>"That the said Sandalio J. Rodriguez, the accused, on December 15, 1915, in 
the municipality of Caloocan, Province of Rizal, P. I., did, then and there, 
wilfully, maliciously, and unlawfully, engage in the business of selling beer at 
retail, without having previously paid the internal revenue license-tax 
corresponding to the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>"Act committed in violation of law."</p>
<p>The information filed in case R. G. No. 13355 alleges:</p>
<p>"That the said Sandalio J. Rodriguez, the accused, on December 15, 1915, in 
the municipality of Caloocan, Province of Rizal, P. I., did, then and there, 
wilfully, maliciously, and unlawfully, engage in the business of selling liquors 
at retail without having previously paid the internal revenue license-tax 
corresponding to the third and fourth quarters.</p>
<p>"Act committed in violation of law."</p>
<p align="center">QUESTIONS INVOLVED.</p>
<p>1. Sufficiency of complaint in R. G. No. 13352.</p>
<p>2. Legality of ordinance imposing a license tax on public dance halls and 
penalizing a violation thereof.</p>
<p>3. Sufficiency of the evidence in R. G. No. 13352.</p>
<p>4. Sufficiency of the informations in R. G. Nos. 13353, 13354, and 13355.</p>
<p>5. Sufficiency of the evidence in these three cases.</p>
<p align="center">OPINION.</p>
<p align="center">I.</p>
<p>A comparison of the complaint and the information filed in R. G. No. 13352 
shows that the accused is charged with the same offense in both of them, namely, 
with having maintained and operated a public dance hall without having secured 
and paid for the municipal license-tax therefor as provided for and penalized by 
ordinances of the municipality of Caloocan. All the requirements as providecj in 
sections 6 and 7 of the Code of Criminal Procedure have been complied with.</p>
<p align="center">II.</p>
<p>A municipality is authorized to enact an ordinance providing for a 
license-tax for the maintenance and operation of public dance halls and 
penalizing the violation of such ordinance. The Municipal Law provides:</p>
<p>The municipal council shall:</p>
<p>"(<em>dd</em>) Fix penalties for violation of ordinances * * * " (Sec. 39, 
Act No. 82.)</p>
<p>"It shall be competent for a municipal council to prescribe fines or 
penalties for violations of its ordinances." * * * (Sec. 2239, Administrative 
Code of 1917.)</p>
<p>"The municipal council is empowered:</p>
<p>"(<em>k</em>) To license and regulate or to prohibit ? * • public dance halls 
* * *." (Sec. 40, Act No. 82.)</p>
<p>"The municipal council shall have authority to exercise the following 
discretionary powers:</p>
<p>(<em>l</em>) To regulate or prohibit * * * public dance halls * * *." (Sec. 
2243, Administrative Code of 1917.)</p>
<p>"A municipal council shall have authority to impose taxes upon persons 
engaged in business or exercising privileges in the municipality as hereinbelow 
specified, by requiring them to procure licenses at rates fixed by ordinance of 
the council:</p>
<p>"(<em>d</em>) Dance halls and public dancing schools." (Sec. 2307, 
Administrative Code of 1917.)</p>
<p>McQuillin in his work on Municipal Corporations says, section 715, page 1555: 
"The penalty of imprisonment imposed by charter for violation of, an ordinance 
is not a debt within the constitutional provision forbidding imprisonment for 
debt." He further states, section 1007, page 2242: "License taxes are not debts 
within the constitutional provision prohibiting imprisonment for debt." 25 Cyc, 
page 634, lays down the following principle: "In the absence of constitutional 
or statutory inhibition, the authority to impose reasonable fines and penalties 
for the failure to pay a license-tax is regarded as a necessary incident to the 
power to levy such tax." (<em>See</em> further U. S. <em>vs</em>. Cara [1917], 
R. G. No. 12632, decided September 13, 1917, not published; and License Tax 
Case, [1867], 5 Wall., 462.)</p>
<p align="center">III.</p>
<p>There is no doubt as to the appellant's having maintained and operated a 
public dance hall during the time alleged in the information. In fact he admits 
this.</p>
<p>The trial court found the accused guilty in this case of a violation of 
Ordinance No. 1, of the municipality of Caloocan (Exhibit A) taken in 
conjunction with Ordinance No. 14 (Exhibit B) of the said municipality. An 
examination of these two ordinances shows that Ordinance No. 1, series 1916, in 
section 1, amends section 9 of Ordinance No. 19, series 1913 (Exhibit I) by 
providing for the payment of the salary of special policemen on duty in public 
dance halls. Section 2 of said ordinance amends section 1 of Ordinance No. 27, 
series 1913 (which does not appear in the record), as amended by section 2 of 
Ordinance No. 14, series 1915, by fixing the amount of the license-taxes for the 
different classes of dance halls. Section 3 of said ordinance provides that the 
penalty for a violation of the two previous sections shall be the same as that 
provided for in section 8 of Ordinance No. 19, series 1913. Section 4 of 
Ordinance No. 14, series 1915, provides for the punishment for a violation of 
this ordinance by a fine of from P25 to P50, or by imprisonment for from one to 
two months, in the discretion of the court. Section 8 of Ordinance No. 19, 
series 1913, provides the amount of the license-tax for dance halls and requires 
that the owner or operator of a public dance hall shall pay the license-tax 
within the first ten days of January, April, July, and October, and his failure 
to pay the license-tax shall constitute a violation of this section and shall be 
punished by a fine equal to the amount of the license-tax, and in case of 
insolvency to suffer subsidiary imprisonment at the rate of Tl per day. The 
penalty provided for in this section is clearly in conflict with the penalty 
provided in section 4 of Ordinance No. 14, series 1915. The penalty imposed in 
the above-mentioned section 8 of Ordinance No. 19, series of 1913, may be 
illegal as the maximum penalty which can be imposed by municipal ordinance is 
P200, whereas the penalty attempted to be imposed exceeds this amount.</p>
<p>It is a primary rule of statutory construction that when two laws cover the 
same subject, one of which is legal and the other illegal, the legal provisions 
will be held to be in effect. It is also a primary canon of constitutional law 
that when a statute is in part unconstitutional and in part good and it is 
possible to discard the unconstitutional part without affecting the good part, 
only the unconstitutional part of the statute will be discarded. Hence the only 
part of section 8 of Ordinance No. 19, series 1913, which would have to be 
discarded is that section which provides for the penalty to be imposed, and as 
section 4 of Ordinance No. 14, series 1915, provides a legal penalty, the proper 
penalty is that provided in the last mentioned section.</p>
<p>As the Court of First Instance imposed the penalty provided in section 4 of 
Ordinance No. 14, series 1915, it evidently considered the penalty provided by 
section 8 of Ordinance No. 19, series 1913, repealed by Ordinance No. 14, series 
of 1915, or else as null and void. Therefore, the judgment and sentence of the 
trial court is correct.</p>
<p align="center">IV.</p>
<p>An examination of the information filed in R. G. Nos. 13353, 13354, 13355 
shows that they charge a violation of the Internal Revenue Law and that they 
comply with all the requirements of sections 6 and 7 of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure. This court has held on numerous occasions that a complaint or an 
information is sufficient when the charge is so stated as to enable a person of 
common understanding and ordinary intelligence to know what is meant and so that 
the court may rule in accordance with law. It is not believed that any person of 
ordinary intelligence would have any difficulty in understanding what is charged 
in the informations in these cases.</p>
<p>The contention of the appellant, that it is necessary to secure the approval 
of the Collector of Internal Revenue before an information is filed, charging a 
criminal violation of the Internal Revenue Law, is so absurd that it is not 
deemed worthy of serious consideration. What that law does provide is that no 
<em>civil</em> action for the recovery of taxes or the enforcement of any fine, 
penalty, or forfeiture under that Act shall be begun without the approval of the 
Collector of Internal Revenue. (<em>See</em> section 1581, Administrative Code 
of 1917.) Of course, it is perfectly obvious that the fines, penalties, and 
forfeitures therein mentioned, are administrative penalties which are only 
recoverable by civil action, and that the law in no way affects or applies to 
criminal prosecutions.</p>
<p align="center">V.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt as to the guilt of the accused. The facts in these 
cases are not disputed. As was said before, the accused himself stated that he 
admitted the facts alleged in the informations and that the only questions 
involved were questions of law.</p>
<p>While there has been some difficulty in discovering the facts in regard to 
each of these cases, due to the manner in which the cases were tried and the way 
in which the evidence was presented, it is believed that a careful analysis of 
the records in all four cases will show the following facts:</p>
<p>That on or about the 15th of December, 1916, an agent of the internal revenue 
went to the dance hall maintained and operated by the appellant; that upon 
entering the dance hall he found that the general public was admitted; that he 
went to a table and called a waiter and ordered a glass of beer which he 
received and paid for; that this appellant upon being requested was unable to 
produce a license as required by the Internal Revenue Law for the sale of beer; 
that this agent of the Internal Revenue seeing some distilled liquors on display 
ordered a glass which was sold to him and that upon requesting the appellant to 
exhibit his license for the sale of the same he was unable to do so; that the 
same agent while in this dance hall saw several packages of cigarettes exposed 
for sale and that the appellant did not have the required license to sell 
cigarettes. It was proven, by another internal revenue agent, that the accused 
came to him in his official capacity as an agent of the Bureau of Internal 
Revenue, for the purpose of effecting an administrative compromise for his 
violations of the Internal Revenue Law; that an offer of compromise was made and 
accepted by this appellant; that at the time of making this administrative 
compromise the appellant freely and voluntarily admitted his guilt and stated 
that it was his desire to effect such a compromise; that the appellant at this 
time stated that he did not then have sufficient money to pay the compromise and 
requested a few days within which to raise the necessary amount; that this 
extension of time was granted to him and upon the defendant's request was 
extended several times and finally after his failure to pay the agreed 
compromise, these criminal cases were filed against him.</p>
<p>No ground exists on which to base the contentions of the defendant and 
appellant. No question of fact is involved. The questions of law raised by the 
defendant are all so elementary and without foundation that it is not deemed 
necessary to cite more authorities.</p>
<p>The respective judgments of the trial court in these four cases are affirmed 
with the costs of this instance against appellant. Let this order stand for R. 
G. No. 13352 and let the appropriate orders be entered in R. G. Nos. 13353, 
13354, 13355. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Johnson, Street, Avanceña</em>, and <em>Fisher, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p></div>
