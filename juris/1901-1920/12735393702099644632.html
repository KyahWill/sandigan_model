				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">An original action in this court for the writ of mandamus against the defendant to compel him to register a certain certificate of title in accordance with the provisions of section&nbsp; 122 of Act No. 496 of the Philippine&nbsp; Commission.<br><br>The petition presented by the plaintiff is as follows:<br><blockquote>"1. That plaintiff&nbsp; is a citizen of the United States of America, of age, and a resident of the city of Manila, Philippine Islands;&nbsp; that&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; is,&nbsp; and at all times herein referred to has&nbsp; been, an officer&nbsp; of the Government of the Philippine&nbsp; Islands, to wit, the acting register&nbsp; of deeds of the subprovince of Benguet, and is a resident of the municipality of Baguio in said subprovince.<br><br>"II. That plaintiff,&nbsp; in accordance with&nbsp; the laws of the Philippine&nbsp; Islands, has located&nbsp; a mineral claim on&nbsp; public and&nbsp; unoccupied land&nbsp; in the&nbsp; barrio of Bua, municipality of Itogon, subprovince of Benguet, has complied with all the requirements of law&nbsp; precedent to the issue of&nbsp; a patent in favor of plaintiff, and that a patent for the said mineral claim has&nbsp; been&nbsp; issued by the Government of the Philippine Islands for said mineral claim in the name of&nbsp; plaintiff and filed by the official who issued said&nbsp; patent with defendant as register of deeds of the subdivision of Benguet; that the said mineral claim is known and recorded as the 'Ultimo Mineral Claim,' and is fully&nbsp; and adequately described in the aforesaid patent.<br><br>"III.&nbsp; That plaintiff has paid to defendant P6, Philippine currency, as fees for the issue of a certificate of title in favor of plaintiff for the aforesaid mineral claim in accordance with the aforesaid patent, and has demanded of defendant that the latter issue&nbsp; such certificate; that defendant neglects and refuses to issue such certificate,&nbsp; unless and until plaintiff shall pay to defendant&nbsp; one-tenth of one per cent of the value of&nbsp; plaintiff's aforesaid mineral claim for an assurance fund&nbsp; and&nbsp; shall file&nbsp; with defendant&nbsp; sworn declarations of three disinterested persons that the value fixed by plaintiff is fair; that plaintiff has refused to pay any sum whatever for an&nbsp; assurance&nbsp; fund and&nbsp; has refused to file such sworn declarations or to fix a value, and upon&nbsp; such refusal has again demanded of defendant that he issue&nbsp; a certificate as aforesaid; that defendant thereupon refused and continues to refuse and neglect to issue to plaintiff&nbsp; a certificate of title for the mineral claim&nbsp; aforesaid.<br><br>"IV.&nbsp; That plaintiff&nbsp; has&nbsp; no plain, speedy, and&nbsp; adequate remedy in the ordinary courts&nbsp; of law,&nbsp; other than a&nbsp; writ of&nbsp; mandate to&nbsp; be issued&nbsp; to&nbsp; defendant commanding him forthwith to enter a certificate of title in the name of plaintiff for the aforesaid&nbsp; mineral claim and issue an owner's duplicate certificate therefor to plaintiff.<br><br>"Wherefore, plaintiff prays that judgment be entered granting a peremptory order against defendant, commanding him, immediately&nbsp; after the&nbsp; receipt of such order, to enter a certificate of title in accordance&nbsp; with the provisions of section 122 of Act No. 496 in the name of plaintiff for the 'Ultimo Mineral Claim,' as described in the patent issued in plaintiff's name by the Government of the Philippine Islands, and to issue an owner's duplicate thereof to, plaintiff; and plaintiff further prays&nbsp; that he be given judgment against defendant for his costs herein."</blockquote>To this&nbsp; petition the defendant presented a demurrer, basing the same upon the following reasons:<br><blockquote>"1. Because it appears from the complaint that the plaintiff has not done all that is required by the provisions of the Land Registration Act to entitle him to demand&nbsp; the, registration of the patent and&nbsp; the entry&nbsp; of a certificate of title and the&nbsp; issuance of an owner's duplicate certificate under section 122 of said Act.<br><br>"2. Because it appears from the complaint that the plaintiff has refused to pay the one-tenth of one per centum of the fair value of&nbsp; the&nbsp; land or any&nbsp; sum whatever for the assurance fund, which&nbsp; by section 99 of said Land Registration Act,&nbsp; as&nbsp; amended, is expressly made .payable to the register of&nbsp; deeds upon&nbsp; the original registration&nbsp; of&nbsp; any land under said Act.<br><br>"3.&nbsp; Because it does not appear from&nbsp; the complaint that the defendant has unlawfully neglected or refused to perform&nbsp; any act which the law&nbsp; specially&nbsp; enjoins&nbsp; as a duty resulting from his office as register of deeds, or that he has unlawfully excluded the plaintiff from the use and enjoyment of any right to which he is entitled, and it does not appear that the duty is specially enjoined upon the register of deeds to register a patent&nbsp; to public land and enter a certificate of&nbsp; title thereto and&nbsp; issue an owner's duplicate certificate without the payment to him of the one-tenth of one per centum of the assessed or fair value of the real estate at the time of such original registration."</blockquote>The petitioner claims that he has complied with all the requirements of law precedent to the issuance of a patent in his favor and that a patent for a mineral claim has been issued by the&nbsp; Government of the Philippine Islands to the plaintiff and has been filed by the official who issued said patent with the defendant as register of deeds of the subprovince of Benguet.&nbsp; This&nbsp; patent was filed with the register of deeds of the subprovince of Benguet for registration in accordance with the provisions of section 122 of Act No. 496.&nbsp; It is alleged by the petitioner that the register of deeds&nbsp; refused to register such&nbsp; patent unless and until&nbsp; he should pay the fee provided for in section 99 of Act No. 496. The question&nbsp; presented&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; court by the demurrer is whether or not it&nbsp; is the plain and specific&nbsp; duty of the register of deeds&nbsp; to&nbsp; register&nbsp; said&nbsp; patent without demanding the fee provided for in section 99 of said Act No. 496. Section 37 of the Act of Congress of July 1,1902, provides how persons, associations, or corporations&nbsp; may secure patents to mineral claims.<br><br>Section 122&nbsp; of Act No. 496 (which Act&nbsp; is known as the Act providing for&nbsp; the registration of lands under the Torrens system) provides that "Wherever public lands in the Philippine Islands belonging to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Government&nbsp; of the United States or to the Government of the Philippine Islands <i></i><i>are alienated,&nbsp; granted, or conveyed to persons or to public or private corporations, the same shall be brought forthwith under the operation of this Act and shall become registered lands."</i><br><br>Section 73 of Act No. 926 provides that patents to public lands shall be issued "in the name of the United States and the&nbsp; Philippine&nbsp; Government under&nbsp; the signature&nbsp; of the Civil Governor; but such&nbsp; patents&nbsp; (patents to public lands) <i> or certificates shall be effective only for the purposes defined in section 122 of the Land Registration Act (No. 496), and the actual conveyance of&nbsp; the land shall be effected only&nbsp; as provided in said section."</i><br><br>That part of section 122&nbsp; (Act No. 496)&nbsp; to which said section 73 (Act No. 926) refers is as follows:<br><blockquote>"The deed, grant, or instrument of conveyance from the Government to the grantee shall not take effect as a conveyance or&nbsp; bind the land, but shall&nbsp; operate only as a contract between the&nbsp; Government and the grantee and as evidence of authority to the clerk or register of deeds to make registration.&nbsp; The act of registration shall be the operative act to convey and affect the lands, and in all cases under this Act (No. 496) registration shall be made in the office of the register of deeds for the province where the land lies.&nbsp; The fees&nbsp; for registration shall be paid by the grantee.&nbsp; After due registration and issue of the certificate and '<i>Owner's duplicate,'</i> such land shall be registered land for all purposes under this Act."</blockquote>The petitioner contends that the only fee for registration which he&nbsp; is required to pay is the fee of $3 (P6) provided for in section 114 of Act No. 496.<br><br>The respondent contends that all patents and certificates granting&nbsp; <i>"public lands</i>" issued by the Government of the United States or the Government of the Philippine Islands, in order to be registered in accordance with the provisions of section 122 (Act No. 496), the holder thereof must pay the fee provided for in section 99 of said Act.<br><br>Act No. 496 of the Philippine Commission provides for a system of registration of land titles&nbsp; under a system popularly known as the "Torrens system."&nbsp; Said Act provides for the registration of titles to <i>lands held by individuals, or, in other words, the registration of titles to lands which have already been granted by the State to private persons.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 19 provides who may make application for registration of title.&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 21, as amended by Act No. 809, provides the form of application.&nbsp; Sections 29 and 41 provide for the registration or recording of the decree of the court granting the registration of&nbsp; the title under&nbsp; said&nbsp; Act.&nbsp; Section 99 provides that in the original registration or&nbsp; recording (meaning simply the first registration under the "Torrens system")&nbsp; that there shall&nbsp; be paid to the register of deeds one-tenth of 1 per cent of the assessed value of the&nbsp; real estate, on the basis of&nbsp; the last assessment&nbsp; for&nbsp; municipal taxation,&nbsp; as an assurance&nbsp; fund.&nbsp;&nbsp; Act No. 700 of the Philippine Commission provides for the method of ascertaining the value&nbsp; of the land, in case the same has not been theretofore assessed&nbsp; for taxation.<br><br>Act No. 926 of the Philippine&nbsp; Commission provides for the issuing of patents to public&nbsp; lands in six different cases, as follows:<br><br>First.&nbsp; Sections 1 to 9, for patents to&nbsp; homesteads on the <i>public domain</i>.<br><br>Second. Sections 10 to 21, for sales&nbsp; of portions of the <i>public domain</i>.<br><br>Third.&nbsp; Sections 22 to 31, for leases&nbsp; of portions of the <i>public domain</i>.<br><br>Fourth. Sections 32 to 35, for free&nbsp; patents to individual settlers on portions of the <i>public domain. </i><br><br>Fifth.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sections&nbsp; 36 to 53, for the&nbsp; reservation of town sites.<br><br>Sixth.&nbsp; Sections&nbsp; 54&nbsp; to 67, for&nbsp; unperfected titles&nbsp; and Spanish grants and concessions of the <i>public domain</i>.<br><br>In each of the above grants or patents issued in accordance&nbsp; with the provisions&nbsp; applicable thereto no&nbsp; provision whatever&nbsp; is made for the payment of a fee for the registration of the patent,&nbsp; except under the patent granted for <i>unperfected titles&nbsp; and Spanish&nbsp; grants and concessions of the public domain,</i> where, in section 57 (Act No. 926), we find this provision:<br><blockquote>"The fees provided to be paid for the registration of lands under the Land Registration Act (No. 496)&nbsp; shall be collected from applicants under this chapter, <i>except</i> that upon the <i>original registration </i> of&nbsp; the land claimed hereunder no fee shall be required for the assurance fund."</blockquote>We believe that this exception is significant of the fact that it was the intention&nbsp; of&nbsp; the lawmaking body to require the payment of the fees&nbsp; for the registration of patents to public lands issued under the provisions of said&nbsp; Act No. 926.&nbsp; This view is emphasized by the fact that section 122 (Act No. 496) expressly&nbsp; provides that <i>all patents to public lands</i>&nbsp; shall be brought forthwith under the provisions of the Act providing for the registration&nbsp; of the land under the "Torrens system."&nbsp; Had&nbsp; it been the intention of the law- making body - as&nbsp; the petitioner claims - not to require the payment of one-tenth of 1 per cent by the holder of a patent to <i>public land </i>for the registration of the same, then why did the Commission expressly relieve the holder of a patent to a portion of the public&nbsp; domain (of unperfected titles and Spanish grants and concessions) from the payment of this fee, when at the same time they had brought <i>all&nbsp; patents to public lands under the provisions of Act No. 496?</i><br><br>It will be noted by comparing section 41 of Act&nbsp; No. 496 with section 122 of the same Act, the former relating to the registration of titles to <i>private lands</i> and the latter to the registration of <i>public lands, that&nbsp; the&nbsp; procedure, after the decree,</i> in the first instance, is granted by the court, and the patent, in the&nbsp; second,&nbsp; by the Governor (see section 73, Act No. 926) is substantially the same.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is as&nbsp; follows. Section 41 provides "Immediately upon the entry&nbsp; of the decree of registration the clerk shall send a certified copy thereof, under the seal of&nbsp; the court, to&nbsp; the register of deeds for the province, or provinces, or city in which the land lies, and the register of deeds shall transcribe the decree in a book to be called&nbsp; the 'Registration Book,'&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *.&nbsp; The entry made by the&nbsp; register of deeds in this book in each case shall be the original certificate of title, and shall be signed by him and sealed with the seal of the court.&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; The register of deeds shall in each case make an<i> exact duplicate of the original certificate,</i> including the seal, but putting on it the words '<i>Owner's duplicate certificate,'</i> and&nbsp; deliver the same to the owner or to his attorney duly authorized."<br><br>Section 122 in part provides "It shall be the duty of the official (the&nbsp; Governor-General)&nbsp; issuing the instrument of alienation, grant,&nbsp; or conveyance in behalf of the Government to&nbsp; cause such instrument,&nbsp; before&nbsp; its delivery to the grantee,&nbsp; to be filed with the register of deeds for the province where the land lies and to be <i>there registered like other deeds and conveyances,</i> whereupon&nbsp; a certificate&nbsp; shall be entered as in other cases of registered land, and an <i>'Owner's duplicate certificate'</i> issued to the grantee."<br><br>It will be&nbsp; noted also that section 122 provides that this patent, "before&nbsp; its delivery to the grantee," shall be&nbsp; filed with the register&nbsp; of deeds&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; "to be&nbsp; there&nbsp; registered <i>like other deeds and conveyances." </i><br><br>What does the phrase "like other deeds and conveyances," when applied to these patents and the&nbsp; registration of the same, mean? It&nbsp; can only mean titles issued under&nbsp; said Act No.&nbsp; 496.&nbsp; It&nbsp; can not be construed to apply&nbsp; to titles given or executed between&nbsp; private parties, for&nbsp; the reason that registration&nbsp; under the "Torrens system" makes no effort to change the method of transferring or registering titles granted by or to private persons, nor for the issuance of an <i>"Owner's duplicate certificate." </i><br><br>It will be noted further that after the patent is filed with the register&nbsp; of&nbsp; deeds for the proper&nbsp; province, that a&nbsp; certificate shall be entered as in other cases of registered land, and an "<i>Owner's duplicate certificate"</i> issued to the grantee. This provision of said section 122 shows clearly&nbsp; that the phrase in said&nbsp; section "to be there&nbsp; registered like other deeds and conveyances" must necessarily refer to "other deeds and conveyances issued in accordance with&nbsp; the&nbsp; provisions of law granting 'Torrens titles.'"<br><br>All these Acts must be construed together.&nbsp;&nbsp; If we were to construe section 41 alone (Act No. 496)&nbsp; we might conclude that the register of property would be compelled to register a private title or a title to private lands granted under said Act without the collection of any&nbsp; fee or fees whatever.&nbsp; This section, read alone, seems to be mandatory in its terms.&nbsp; It says nothing about the collection of fees; yet no&nbsp; one contends&nbsp; that the fees provided for in section 99 of said Act must not be paid before the owner&nbsp; of the "original title" is entitled to the certificate.<br><br>Section&nbsp; 122 provides that the&nbsp; register of deeds must collect&nbsp; the&nbsp; fees.&nbsp; To&nbsp; what does&nbsp; the&nbsp; word&nbsp; "fees" apply? Section 57 of Act No. 926 says that the fees provided for the registration&nbsp; of&nbsp; lands, under the Land Registration Act, shall be collected from the applicants, <i> except that no fee shall be required for an assurance fund. </i><br><br>Section 114 of Act No. 496 as amended by&nbsp; section 7 of Act&nbsp; No. 1648, as well as by section 11 of&nbsp; Act No. 1699, provides what fees shall be collected&nbsp; in the course&nbsp; of the proceedings for the registration of titles under the "Torrens system" and the amount in each case.&nbsp;&nbsp; This section&nbsp; (114) with its amendments read alone might be construed to include or cover all fees.&nbsp;&nbsp; It will be noted, however, that <i>all these fees</i> are for services actually rendered by the officers of the Court of Land Registration or by the register of deeds of the province, etc.,&nbsp; while the fee under section 99&nbsp; is not for services at all, but for the purpose of creating an "assurance fund."<br><br>The applicant admitted, by paying the fee for recording or registering his patent, that section 114 of Act No. 496, as amended, was applicable to&nbsp; a&nbsp; patent for public&nbsp; lands. An examination of section 114, as amended, shows that the only fee or fees collectible are fees&nbsp; for services&nbsp; actually rendered by employees of the Government.<br><br>Section 6 of Act&nbsp; No. 1699 provides&nbsp; that all fees for the services of the clerk of the Court of Land Registration shall be deposited in the Insular&nbsp; Treasury,&nbsp; and all fees&nbsp; payable for the&nbsp; services of&nbsp; the register&nbsp; of&nbsp; deeds, etc.,&nbsp; shall be deposited in the provincial treasury, or in the case of the register of the city of Manila, then&nbsp; they shall be deposited in the Insular Treasury.<br><br>These funds are not available&nbsp; for the payment of any damages which may&nbsp; result to&nbsp; the real owner of&nbsp; property by reason&nbsp; of an illegal or&nbsp; improper registration under the "Torrens system"&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; name&nbsp; of&nbsp; another, not&nbsp; the real owner.&nbsp;&nbsp; (See sees.&nbsp; 100, 101,102,&nbsp; and 103, Act No.&nbsp; 496.)<br><br>The "assurance fund" is created for the purpose of paying any damages which may result from an improper or illegal registration.&nbsp; All the people of the Philippine Archipelago may be taxed for the purpose of paying&nbsp; these damages if the "assurance fund" is&nbsp; not sufficient,&nbsp;&nbsp; (Sec. 103, Act No.&nbsp; 496.)&nbsp;&nbsp; A large portion&nbsp; of the lands of the Archipelago still belong to&nbsp; the public domain.&nbsp; All original patents granted thereto are given the advantage&nbsp; and protection of the provisions of Act No. 496. Why should the future holders of these original patents be entitled to the protection&nbsp; of&nbsp; this law without sharing its burdens?&nbsp; We believe&nbsp; that when the legislative department of the Government provided that "Whenever public lands in the Philippine Islands,&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; are&nbsp; alienated, granted, or&nbsp; conveyed to persons or to public or to private corporations, the same shall be brought forthwith under&nbsp; the operation of this&nbsp; Act&nbsp; (No. 496) and&nbsp; shall become registered lands," thereby giving the holder of&nbsp; these&nbsp; original patents the benefit of said Act (No. 496), it intended also to impose upon such grantees the burdens of said Act.&nbsp; But in&nbsp; reply to this consideration we are met with the question,&nbsp; Why should the&nbsp; Government require a&nbsp; fund to insure against its own&nbsp; acts, thereby implying that&nbsp; there&nbsp; is no possibility of mistakes occurring in the&nbsp; granting of these patents and that&nbsp; there&nbsp; is no possibility of the occurrence of damages? The, literally,&nbsp; hundreds of&nbsp; cases which have&nbsp; been&nbsp; brought in the courts of the United States to set aside original patents granted by the Government&nbsp; which have been secured by fraud, mistake, etc., are a complete answer to this&nbsp; contention.<br><br>We are of the opinion and so hold that when the legislative department of the Government provided&nbsp; in&nbsp; section 99 of Act No. 496 that "Upon the original registration of land&nbsp; under this Act," etc.,&nbsp; "there&nbsp; shall be&nbsp; paid&nbsp; to the register of deeds one-tenth of one per cent of the assessed value of the real estate," etc.; and when it provided that "Whenever&nbsp; public lands," etc., "are&nbsp; alienated, granted, or conveyed," etc.,&nbsp; "the same shall be brought forthwith under the provisions of this Act" (sec. 122, Act No. 496), that it intended to bring all future titles&nbsp; granted&nbsp; to public lands immediately under the&nbsp; "Torrens system"&nbsp; and&nbsp; that such holders, in&nbsp; order to secure the registration of such titles, should make a contribution to the "assurance fund."<br><br>It not being the clear and&nbsp; specific legal duty,&nbsp; therefore, of the defendant to register the patent in question without requiring the payment of the fee&nbsp; provided for&nbsp; in&nbsp; section 99 of Act No. 496, the demurrer is hereby sustained with costs, and the&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; is hereby&nbsp; given&nbsp; ten days from receipt&nbsp; of notice of this decision in which to amend his petition, if&nbsp; he so desires.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the petition&nbsp; is not amended within ten days, then let a judgment be entered with costs denying the issuance of the writ&nbsp; of mandamus prayed for&nbsp; in said petition.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano,&nbsp; C. J., Torres</i> and <i>Mapa, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="left"><br><br><center><br><i>DISSENTING</i><br></center><br><br><br><b>MORELAND, <i>J.,</i> </b><br><br>In this dissenting opinion I shall discuss&nbsp; the case at bar in two aspects.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first place, upon the plain provisions of the&nbsp; laws invoked in support of the majority opinion, the plaintiff is&nbsp; entitled to the writ prayed for.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the second place, if&nbsp; those laws mean what the majority of the court claim they do, then they are utterly and irremediably in violation of the express provisions&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Philippine Bill, and, therefore, null and void.<br><br>First, as to the plain provisions of the&nbsp; laws:<br><br>After full compliance on his&nbsp; part with the provisions of the mining laws, there was issued to plaintiff a&nbsp; patent for the "Ultimo" mineral claim,&nbsp; in the subprovince&nbsp; of Benguet.&nbsp; This patent, instead of being delivered personally to the plaintiff, .was,&nbsp; in accordance with section 122 of Act No. 496, sent to defendant as register of deeds of the province where the patented land is situated.&nbsp;&nbsp; That section is as follows:<br><blockquote>"Whenever public lands in the Philippine Islands belonging to the&nbsp; Government&nbsp; of the&nbsp; United&nbsp; States or to&nbsp; the Government of the Philippine Islands are alienated, granted, or conveyed&nbsp; to persons or to public or private corporations, the&nbsp; same shall be brought forthwith under the&nbsp; operation of this Act and shall become registered lands.&nbsp; It shall be the duty of the official issuing the instrument of alienation, grant, or conveyance in behalf of the Government to cause such instrument, before&nbsp; its delivery to the grantee, to be filed with the register of deeds for the province where the land lies and to be there registered like&nbsp; other deeds&nbsp; and conveyances,&nbsp; whereupon&nbsp; a certificate&nbsp; shall be entered as in other cases of registered land,&nbsp; and an owner's duplicate certificate issued to the grantee.&nbsp;&nbsp; The deed, grant,&nbsp; or instrument of conveyance from the Government to the grantee shall not take effect as a&nbsp; conveyance or bind&nbsp; the&nbsp; land, but shall operate only as a contract&nbsp; between&nbsp; the&nbsp; Government and the&nbsp; grantee and as evidence&nbsp; of authority to&nbsp; the clerk or&nbsp; register&nbsp; of deeds&nbsp; to&nbsp; make registration.&nbsp;&nbsp; The act of registration shall be the operative act to convey and affect the lands, and in all cases under this Act registration shall be&nbsp; made in&nbsp; the office of&nbsp; the&nbsp; register of deeds for&nbsp; the province where the land lies.&nbsp; The fees&nbsp; for&nbsp; registration shall be&nbsp; paid by the grantee.&nbsp; After due&nbsp; registration&nbsp; and issue of the certificate and owner's duplicate such land shall be registered land for all purposes under this&nbsp; Act."</blockquote>Plaintiff paid&nbsp; to&nbsp; defendant P6 to&nbsp; cover the&nbsp; fees&nbsp; for registration, raising no question as to whether any fees may lawfully&nbsp; be required of him, nor as to the amount thereof, and desiring only to cover the full amount that defendant may lawfully be entitled to charge for entering a certificate of title and&nbsp; issuing&nbsp; a&nbsp; duplicate&nbsp; thereof to the&nbsp; plaintiff. Defendant now requires of plaintiff a further payment of one-tenth of 1 per cent of the value of the patented land for&nbsp; an assurance fund, and requires plaintiff to file the affidavits of three disinterested persons for the purpose of showing that the value fixed by plaintiff is just.&nbsp; Defendant doubtless relies for such&nbsp; requirement upon section 99 of Act No. 496, which, as amended by Act No. 700, reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"Upon the original registration&nbsp; of land under this Act, and also upon the entry of a certificate showing title as registered owners in heirs or devisees, there shall be paid to the register of deeds one-tenth of one per centum of the assessed value of the real estate on&nbsp; the basis of the last assessment for municipal taxation, as an assurance fund.<br><br>"In case land is subdivided subsequent to the last assessment and registration proceedings are had as&nbsp; to a portion only of such land, the value of such portion, for&nbsp; the purposes of this section&nbsp; and for the payment required by paragraph four of section one hundred and fourteen, shall be fixed by agreement between the applicant and the tax collector of the city or province where the land&nbsp; is situated and shall be proportioned to the value such&nbsp; land bears to the whole tract assessed.&nbsp; In case of disagreement between the tax collector and the applicant as to the&nbsp; value of the land, the question shall be submitted to the court for decision.<br><br>"Where land sought to be registered has not been assessed for taxation, its value, for the purposes of this Act shall be its market value, and the applicant shall file with his application&nbsp; the&nbsp; sworn declaration&nbsp; of three&nbsp; disinterested persons that the value fixed by him is to their knowledge a fair valuation.<br><br>"The court is authorized&nbsp; to increase&nbsp; the&nbsp; valuation&nbsp; as fixed&nbsp; under the two preceding paragraphs should it appear upon&nbsp; the hearing that the value stated in the application is too small."</blockquote>The issue is therefore this: Defendant contends that his registration of the patent, entering of the&nbsp; certificate, and issue&nbsp; of&nbsp; the duplicate, under section&nbsp; 122, constitutes "the original registration of land under this Act," as the phrase is used in section&nbsp; 99;&nbsp; while plaintiff maintains that "the original registration of land under this Act" does not embrace the proceedings of a register of deeds under section 122.<br><br>It is apparent that sections 99 to 107 of the Land Registration Act provide in effect an insurance of titles, and that the payment of one-tenth of 1 per cent upon original registration is practically a premium for such insurance.<br><br>Act No. 496 provides&nbsp; two ways in&nbsp; which land may be brought under the Torrens system.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; first way is&nbsp; by judicial proceedings in the Court of Land Registration, terminating in the decree of that court.&nbsp;&nbsp; The second way is by proceedings purely administrative taken upon the alienation of public lands.&nbsp; The first method is provided for in sections 19 to 49; the second by section 122.&nbsp; I submit that only the first method, that is, registration upon a judicial decree, is meant by the phrase "original registration," as employed in section 99.<br><br>If it&nbsp; should&nbsp; appear that the phrase "original&nbsp; registration" is used with a particular meaning in previous sections of Act&nbsp; No. 496, then it may fairly be assumed that it is used with&nbsp; the&nbsp; same meaning in&nbsp; section 99.&nbsp; Sections&nbsp; 19 to 49 of the Act, covering judicial proceedings in the Court of Land&nbsp; Registration,&nbsp; are&nbsp; grouped&nbsp; under the&nbsp; general heading "ORIGINAL REGISTRATION."&nbsp; Again examining section 99, as amended&nbsp; by Act No. 700, we find&nbsp; that the three paragraphs&nbsp; added&nbsp; by Act No. 700&nbsp; indicate clearly that "original registration," as used in that section, refers only to&nbsp; registration upon judicial decree, and that the insurance premium is to be paid only for a judicial proceeding.&nbsp;&nbsp; Where, for&nbsp; instance, registered land has not&nbsp; been assessed for taxation,&nbsp; its market&nbsp; value must be stated by the <i>applicant</i> in his <i>application,</i>&nbsp; and this&nbsp; must be accompanied by three disinterested affidavits confirming the value fixed by the <i>applicant.</i>&nbsp; And so, where land has been subdivided since the last assessment,&nbsp; the tax collector and the <i>applicant</i> shall agree upon the assessment value of the parcel sought&nbsp; to&nbsp; be registered.&nbsp; Upon reference to the sections under the&nbsp; head of original registration, we find that "applicant" is the term used for the petitioner in the Court of Land Registration,&nbsp; and&nbsp; "application"&nbsp; is the technical name for his petition.&nbsp;&nbsp; The form of application contained in section&nbsp; 21, in its second&nbsp; clause, provides for fixing&nbsp; the value.&nbsp; All this is entirely inapplicable to the registration upon the alienation of public lands.&nbsp; "Applicant" and "application"&nbsp; unquestionably&nbsp; refer to the party&nbsp; and&nbsp; to&nbsp; his pleading in the Court of Land&nbsp; Registration; and although public lands,&nbsp; previous to&nbsp; the issue of patent, are&nbsp; not&nbsp; assessed for&nbsp; taxation, there is no&nbsp; provision under the mining laws&nbsp; whereby the locator of a mineral claim is required at any stage of the proceedings to fix the value of his claim. Defendant requires plaintiff&nbsp; to file the affidavits of three disinterested&nbsp; persons that the&nbsp; value&nbsp; fixed&nbsp; by plaintiff is fair.&nbsp; This requirement is evidently based upon section 99 as amended, and its inapplicability is evident from the fact that plaintiff has never fixed any value, as that was&nbsp; wholly unnecessary in the proceeding he took.<br><br>Again, section 99, as&nbsp; amended, provides that&nbsp; in case of a subdivision after the last assessment, if there is disagreement between the tax collector and the applicant the question shall be submitted to&nbsp; the court for decision; and that if the value fixed by the applicant should appear, u<i>pon&nbsp; the hearing</i>, too small, the&nbsp; court is authorized&nbsp; to increase it. This&nbsp; indicates beyond&nbsp; question that&nbsp;&nbsp; section&nbsp; 99 has&nbsp; reference only to "original registration," that is&nbsp; to&nbsp; say, to registration upon a decree of&nbsp; court.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; the proceedings by this&nbsp; plaintiff for a title to his mineral claim, no court has intervened.<br><br>An examination&nbsp; of section&nbsp; 122 of the Land Registration Act&nbsp; confirms the&nbsp; interpretation&nbsp; which I have given to section&nbsp; 99.&nbsp; It is there provided that upon the filing with the register of a patent&nbsp; for public land, it shall&nbsp; be <i>"registered like other deeds and conveyances</i>, whereupon&nbsp; a&nbsp; certificate shall be entered as in other cases of registered land." There is no provision in the Land Registration Act for a payment to the insurance fund&nbsp; upon the registration of deeds and conveyances.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such payment is made only upon "<i>original registration"</i>&nbsp; (with the single&nbsp; exception&nbsp; of&nbsp; the registration of&nbsp; inheritances&nbsp; and&nbsp; devises).&nbsp; Registration upon a judicial decree, under sections 19&nbsp; to 49, is a ratification of an existing title; while a registration under section 122,&nbsp; as&nbsp; in&nbsp; the case of "other deeds&nbsp; and&nbsp; conveyances," is the certification&nbsp; of a&nbsp; new&nbsp; title to the grantee.&nbsp; Registration,&nbsp; under section 122, is therefore analogous to the entry of a&nbsp; certificate under&nbsp; section 57, rather than to the&nbsp; entry of an original certificate under sections&nbsp; 41&nbsp; and 42.<br><br>Again, section 122 provides: "The fees for registration shall&nbsp; be paid by the grantee."&nbsp; It is clear that the insurance premium provided for in section 99 is not a fee in any real sense,&nbsp; and it would seem&nbsp; to be&nbsp; equally clear that if the legislature had intended to require a patentee of public lands to pay the insurance premium, section 122 would have so stated.<br><br>That the Philippine Commission understood the phrase "original registration&nbsp; under this&nbsp; Act" meant only registration upon a decree&nbsp; of the Land Court,&nbsp; as distinguished from&nbsp; registration upon&nbsp; the issue&nbsp; of&nbsp; a patent, is&nbsp; also apparent&nbsp; from an&nbsp; examination of&nbsp; Act No. 926, the Public Land Act, enacted in&nbsp; pursuance&nbsp; of&nbsp; the provisions of the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Public Land Act provides for the alienation of the public domain in six several ways: homesteads on the&nbsp; public domain;&nbsp; sales of portions of the public&nbsp; domain;&nbsp; leases of portions of the public domain; free patents to native settlers; town sites; and unperfected titles and Spanish grants and concessions. It provides that unperfected titles and Spanish grants shall be perfected by proceedings in the Court of Land Registration&nbsp; leading to a decree&nbsp; and the issue of&nbsp; a certificate thereon&nbsp; (sec. 63&nbsp; of Act&nbsp; No. 926).&nbsp; All the other methods of alienation&nbsp; are administrative&nbsp; proceedings under the direction of the&nbsp; Bureau&nbsp; of Lands, and lead to the&nbsp; issue of patents which are&nbsp; to&nbsp; be converted into&nbsp; certificates of title in accordance with the provisions of section 122 of Act No. 496&nbsp; (see&nbsp; sec. 73&nbsp; of&nbsp; Act No.&nbsp; 926).&nbsp;&nbsp; There can be no reason why an insurance&nbsp; premium should be collected from native settlers entitled to&nbsp; free patents, and none from applicants for the perfection of incomplete Spanish' grants; and yet we&nbsp; find that&nbsp; by the last sentence of section 57 of Act No. 926 the latter class are specifically exempted from the&nbsp; payment of this&nbsp; insurance premium.&nbsp; It must,&nbsp; therefore, have been the understanding of the Commission that specific exemption was&nbsp; unnecessary in the case of persons obtaining patents&nbsp; through&nbsp; the Bureau&nbsp; of Lands, for the reason that the issue of certificates upon such patents&nbsp; is not&nbsp; included in "original registration,"&nbsp; as used in section 99 of Act No. 496,&nbsp; and&nbsp; that such exemption was necessary in cases where the certificates were issued upon a decree of the Court of Land Registration.<br><br>I have thus stated affirmatively the argument in a general way deducible&nbsp; in favor of&nbsp; plaintiff's case from the&nbsp; plain provisions of&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; laws&nbsp; invoked to sustain&nbsp; the majority opinion in this&nbsp; case,&nbsp; I&nbsp; now propose, in an amplification of those arguments, to examine the positions successively taken by the court in its opinion as it advanced the final conclusion.<br><br>It must be borne always in&nbsp; mind that the court in its opinion is continually comparing two proceedings,&nbsp; one a purely administrative proceeding for a patent&nbsp; to public lands, that is,&nbsp; a proceeding to obtain title, and&nbsp; the other a&nbsp; purely judicial&nbsp; proceeding&nbsp; to register&nbsp; a title already acquired; and by such comparison drawing the conclusions upon which its judgment is based.&nbsp;&nbsp; The court quotes as the basis of and reason for its&nbsp; decision no law but the Public Land Law (No. 926)&nbsp; and the Torrens Law (No. 496), the one providing for the administrative proceeding for a title and&nbsp; the other the judicial&nbsp; proceeding&nbsp; upon a title <i>already acquired.</i>&nbsp; The decision&nbsp; admits, in effect, that the provisions of the Public Land&nbsp; Law (No. 926), the law which provides how and under what conditions a patent to&nbsp; public lands may be obtained,&nbsp; do not <i>expressly</i> require an insurance premium to be paid as a part of such&nbsp; proceeding, in other words, that the payment of an insurance premium or assessment is not, under said&nbsp; law, a&nbsp; part&nbsp; of the proceeding,&nbsp; a condition precedent to obtain title.&nbsp; This admission is unquestionably in accordance with the fact.&nbsp; Nowhere in said law is there&nbsp; the slightest mention of the insurance premium or assurance fund.&nbsp;&nbsp; The opinion also admits,&nbsp; in the same way, that the provisions of the Torrens Law (Act No. 496), which&nbsp; require the payment of&nbsp; an&nbsp; insurance&nbsp; premium&nbsp; or assessment as a condition precedent to the registration of title, do not expressly require the payment of such premium or assessment in proceedings under the Public Land Law. This admission is also unquestionably in accordance&nbsp; with the fact; for nowhere in Act No.&nbsp; 496, the Torrens Law, is&nbsp; there any express provision requiring such payment to be made.&nbsp; Summarizing&nbsp; these admissions of the court, it is&nbsp; unquestioned&nbsp; that there is no law&nbsp; anywhere expressly requiring the payment of an insurance assessment in proceedings to obtain a&nbsp; patent to public lands.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is necessarily so.&nbsp; If it were not, there&nbsp; would have been no cause of this character here and these opinions would&nbsp; not&nbsp; have been written.&nbsp; The provision requiring payment would have been expressed and no question&nbsp; concerning the necessity of its payment&nbsp; could have arisen.<br><br>As a result of this, the&nbsp; necessity&nbsp; for such payment must be interpreted, construed, spelled, implied out of the law, or the payment can not&nbsp; be required.&nbsp; That&nbsp; is what the court has done.&nbsp; It has compared and analyzed and inferred and deduced in order to require the payment.<br><br>It is a universal maxim of statutory construction&nbsp; that where the meaning of a statute is doubtful, the&nbsp; construction most in&nbsp; accordance&nbsp; with reason&nbsp; and justice should be adopted; for it&nbsp; will&nbsp; not&nbsp; be&nbsp; presumed&nbsp; that the legislature contemplated unreason or injustice.&nbsp; The construction given by the court to the statutes&nbsp; involved in the case at bar is, in&nbsp; my humble judgment,&nbsp; unjust and unreasonable.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp; have so much confidence in the judgment&nbsp; of my associates and so little in my own that only&nbsp; the sternest necessity,&nbsp; as&nbsp; I regard it, induces me to dissent from the&nbsp; decision of the court in this&nbsp; case.&nbsp; If the decision did not&nbsp; involve,&nbsp; in my humble judgment, a&nbsp; misapprehension of the&nbsp; nature and purposes&nbsp; of the Torrens&nbsp; Law,&nbsp; and an&nbsp; opposition to the policy of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Government in relation to the&nbsp; public lands, I would not permit myself to dissent.<br><br>The sole question is whether an individual who has purchased&nbsp; from the Government&nbsp; a&nbsp; portion&nbsp; of its&nbsp; public land and paid&nbsp; to the&nbsp; Government the value thereof&nbsp; as fixed by law, shall then be required, before he can register the deed which the Government has given&nbsp; him, to pay to the Government a further&nbsp; sum&nbsp; to&nbsp; insure&nbsp; the very title which the Government has just&nbsp; given him.&nbsp; In other words, must a vendee for full value himself protect the title&nbsp; of the vendor? That is&nbsp; to&nbsp; say,&nbsp; must&nbsp; the&nbsp; vendee, in&nbsp; the&nbsp; absence of his agreement to&nbsp; do&nbsp; so, warrant the title of&nbsp; the vendor?&nbsp; The decision&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; court in&nbsp; this&nbsp; case says "yes."&nbsp; For this reversal of&nbsp; every principle of law and justice&nbsp; relating to real estate&nbsp; uninterruptedly applied in&nbsp; every part&nbsp; of the civilized world&nbsp; from&nbsp; Justinian&nbsp; to Blackstone and&nbsp; from Blackstone to Washburn,&nbsp; some&nbsp; solid&nbsp; reason ought&nbsp; to&nbsp; be given.&nbsp; Such&nbsp; reason can not justly be construed by tortuous process&nbsp; out of a doubtful situation.&nbsp; It should not be necessary to spend pages in confrontation of&nbsp; laws, in comparison of phraseology, in interpretation and substitution of words and&nbsp; sentences, in&nbsp; close&nbsp; and intricate analysis, in strained construction and uncertain interpretation, in order to find such reason.&nbsp; It should, in fairness and in justice, be so clear&nbsp; and&nbsp; plain as&nbsp; to leave&nbsp; absolutely no room for doubt.&nbsp; It is an&nbsp; invariable rule&nbsp; of statutory construction and interpretation, as I have said before, that a statute will never be <i>construed </i>so&nbsp; as to work injustice. To produce such a result the terms of the law must be&nbsp; so plain as to require no construction.<br><br>The plaintiff&nbsp; in&nbsp; this case bought mining&nbsp; lands of the Government.&nbsp; He paid the full&nbsp; purchase price therefor. The&nbsp; Government granted him&nbsp; a&nbsp; patent.&nbsp; When&nbsp; it&nbsp; was sought to record this&nbsp; patent&nbsp; in&nbsp; the office of the register that functionary&nbsp; refused to register it, unless the plaintiff should pay to the Government a certain sum to warrant the validity of that title.<br><br>It may be said, as the opinion indicates,&nbsp; that the payment to the assurance fund is not to protect the patentee, but the person who may be injured by the bringing of the patentee's title under the Torrens Law; that it is&nbsp; not the benefit to the&nbsp; patentee but to the person injured by the operation of the law which is the basis of the requirement to pay.&nbsp; But the instant reply is that if the person&nbsp; who pays&nbsp; gets no benefit, why should he&nbsp; pay?&nbsp; It is&nbsp; unjust, unfair, if not absolutely unconstitutional, to require one to part with his property without consideration.&nbsp; No law may compel one&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay&nbsp; money solely&nbsp; to&nbsp; benefit&nbsp; some one else. He must be&nbsp; the one benefited&nbsp; if&nbsp; he&nbsp; pays.&nbsp; The only legal basis upon which the Torrens Law&nbsp; can stand is that the one who pays&nbsp; is the one who benefits.&nbsp;&nbsp; If, on the other hand, it be held that the&nbsp; patentee is benefited by the payment in that his&nbsp; title&nbsp; is thereafter&nbsp; absolutely guaranteed, that the land itself can never be taken&nbsp; away from him by reason of defects in the Government's title, the reply comes that the patentee, having paid the full consideration required by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Government,&nbsp; and having obtained title from&nbsp; the Government, his&nbsp; title is <i>already&nbsp; </i>guaranteed.&nbsp; Can a title be better guaranteed than by having the&nbsp; Government itself back of it?&nbsp;&nbsp; What more can the Torrens Law offer&nbsp; by way of a warranty than the power and resources of the Government itself?&nbsp; Nothing&nbsp; whatever. The&nbsp; Government may repeal the Torrens Law utterly&nbsp; and apply the assurance fund&nbsp; to&nbsp; other&nbsp; purposes, but&nbsp; it&nbsp; can not, except&nbsp; by&nbsp; the odious and&nbsp; infamous process&nbsp; of repudiation, escape its contract&nbsp; with a patentee to protect his&nbsp; title.&nbsp; When&nbsp; the patentee paid&nbsp; P25 per&nbsp; hectare,&nbsp; the full purchase price of the public land bought as fixed&nbsp; by law, he then and there paid the full consideration for a warranty of title.&nbsp;&nbsp; It could not have been intended that he pay a <i>whole</i> purchase price and&nbsp; get&nbsp; <i>half </i>a title.&nbsp;&nbsp; It could not have been presumed that he should pay a sound price&nbsp; and get an unsound title. The Government&nbsp; which rigidly enforces&nbsp; the maxim that a sound price&nbsp; imports a&nbsp; sound article&nbsp; among its&nbsp; citizens can not in decency refuse to apply&nbsp; that doctrine to itself. This&nbsp; being so, what is there of equity, fairness, or justice in the requirement that the patentee in this case shall again pay for the protection of his&nbsp; title?&nbsp; Why should he pay twice for the same thing?<br><br>But it&nbsp; may be said that the Government's warranty of title&nbsp; on the&nbsp; sale is merely&nbsp; a covenant running with&nbsp; the land&nbsp; and&nbsp; does not insure&nbsp; to the patentee <i>the land itself</i>; that&nbsp; section&nbsp; 122, by&nbsp; bringing the title under the&nbsp; Torrens Law,&nbsp; insures that the patentee shall retain the land itself whatever&nbsp; the defect&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Government's title may have been; and that the patentee, being thus assured of something more&nbsp; than he would get&nbsp; under a covenant of warranty, should pay for it.&nbsp; In reply it&nbsp; may be noted, in the first place, that the fact that the <i>land itself</i> is assured to&nbsp; the patentee&nbsp; constitutes&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; law no&nbsp; greater consideration than&nbsp; the&nbsp; covenant of warranty.&nbsp; In the eyes of&nbsp; the&nbsp; law the one is as valuable as&nbsp; the other.&nbsp; Moreover, if should be observed&nbsp; that inasmuch&nbsp; as&nbsp; section 122&nbsp; provides&nbsp; that the issuance and delivery&nbsp; of the patent&nbsp; do not&nbsp; actually transfer the&nbsp; title but operate merely as a contract&nbsp; between the Government&nbsp; and the patentee, and that the operative act to transfer&nbsp; the title&nbsp; is the <i>registration</i>,&nbsp; it is evident that the assurance assessment is paid while the title is&nbsp; yet in the Government.&nbsp; Why,&nbsp; then, is the Government&nbsp; not justly the one to pay this assessment, if anyone is to pay it?&nbsp; If anyone is being injured, he&nbsp; is that one, and he is injured by reason of the Government selling lands which do not belong to&nbsp; it.&nbsp;&nbsp; The patentee pays and gets for such payment&nbsp; absolutely&nbsp; nothing in the&nbsp; eye of&nbsp; the law that he did not already have.<br><br>It should be noted, also,&nbsp; that the payment&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; assurance fund, under the Torrens Law itself, is purely voluntary.&nbsp; One is not obliged to apply for the registration of his title under that law.&nbsp; It is wholly optional&nbsp;&nbsp; One may leave his title as it was before the passage of that law.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Legislature, in enacting that law, was very careful not to make registration compulsory.&nbsp;&nbsp; One may assume the risk himself.&nbsp; It was very careful also to provide that no title should suffer by reason of a failure to register.&nbsp; Under the holding of the court in this case,&nbsp; however, no choice is left to a patentee..&nbsp; He must come&nbsp; under that&nbsp; law willy nilly.&nbsp; He must pay whether he will&nbsp; or not.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is of no significance that he is satisified with the title the Government gives him and&nbsp; wishes no further guaranty than the Government itself. It is of no consequence that he is willing to assume&nbsp; the risk himself.&nbsp; He must take what the law offers whether he will or not, and whether it really&nbsp; benefits him or not; and&nbsp; he must pay for it, too.&nbsp; I maintain that such a construction is unfair and unjust.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no reason whatever why one&nbsp; who comes under the Torrens Law by virtue of having purchased land&nbsp; from the Government should be <i>obliged</i> to pay, while all&nbsp; other&nbsp; owners or purchasers of real estate <i>may pay or not as&nbsp; they please. </i> One who purchases public&nbsp; lands is&nbsp; assisting in carrying out a&nbsp; great Government program, that of&nbsp; the&nbsp; development of the&nbsp; resources of the Islands.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the manifest purpose of&nbsp; the Insular Government to exploit&nbsp; the great mineral wealth of this&nbsp; country; to induce as&nbsp; many&nbsp; deserving persons as possible to take up homesteads; to develop the wealth of&nbsp; the forests;&nbsp; in short, to make&nbsp; earth, field, and forest yield up their riches.&nbsp; To&nbsp; fasten upon every&nbsp; person who desires to enter with heart and hand into this scheme of the Government an obligatory&nbsp; payment as a&nbsp; condition precedent to such cooperation is, to the extent of that obligation, to present an obstruction and a hindrance in the way of&nbsp; the Government's&nbsp; policy.<br><br>Moreover, the Torrens Law, by&nbsp; its&nbsp; very terms, applies only&nbsp; to titles <i>already acquired</i>.&nbsp; It does not apply to&nbsp; the <i>process of acquiring</i> title.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; simply&nbsp; registers a title&nbsp; already vested.&nbsp;&nbsp; It does not pretend in any way to make compliance with any of its&nbsp; provisions a condition precedent to the <i>vesting</i> of a title.&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>It begins to operate only after&nbsp; the title&nbsp; is vested. </i> Section 19 of that law provides,&nbsp; in part: "Application&nbsp; for&nbsp; registration&nbsp; of title&nbsp; may be made by the following persons, namely:<br><blockquote>"First. The person or persons claiming, singly or collectively,<i> to own the legal estate&nbsp; in fee simple.</i>"</blockquote>By section 21 the application must contain the statement that&nbsp; the applicant&nbsp; is "the&nbsp; owner in fee simple&nbsp; (or by possessory information)" of&nbsp; the land the title to which is to be registered.&nbsp; That is to say, that before one is allowed even&nbsp; to&nbsp; initiate the proceedings&nbsp; by which the title is&nbsp; registered,&nbsp; he&nbsp; must be the owner&nbsp; of the premises&nbsp; or have such&nbsp; interest therein&nbsp; as the law&nbsp; requires.&nbsp; The&nbsp; purpose of the law is to insure or assure a title <i>already vested.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was never intended to be a means of obtaining&nbsp; title or to be a <i> step in&nbsp; or a part&nbsp; of</i> the proceedings by which that title was obtained.&nbsp;&nbsp; This being so, section 122, Act No. 496, has no such significance or meaning as is given to it by the opinion of the court in this case.&nbsp; That section provides:<br><blockquote>"Whenever public lands in the Philippine Islands belonging to the Government of the United States or to the Government of the Philippine&nbsp; Islands are alienated, granted, or conveyed to persons or&nbsp; to public or private corporations, the same shall&nbsp; be brought&nbsp; forthwith under the operation of this Act and shall become&nbsp; registered lands.&nbsp; It&nbsp; shall be the duty of the official issuing the instrument of alienation, grant, or conveyance in behalf of the Government to cause such&nbsp; instrument, before its delivery&nbsp; to the grantee, to be filed with the register of deeds for the province where the land lies and to be there registered like other deeds and conveyances, whereupon&nbsp; a certificate&nbsp; shall be entered as in other cases&nbsp; of registered land, and&nbsp; an owner's duplicate certificate issued to&nbsp; the&nbsp; grantee.&nbsp; The deed,&nbsp; grant, or instrument of conveyance from the Government to the grantee shall not take effect as a conveyance to bind&nbsp; the land,&nbsp; but shall&nbsp; operate only as a contract between the&nbsp; Government and the&nbsp; grantee and as evidence of the authority to&nbsp; the clerk&nbsp; or&nbsp; register of deeds to&nbsp; make the registration.&nbsp; The act of registration shall be the operative act&nbsp; to convey and affect the lands, and in all cases under this Act registration shall be made in the office of the register of deeds for the province where the land lies.&nbsp; The fees for registration shall be paid by the grantee.&nbsp; After due registration and issue of the certificate and owner's duplicate such land shall be registered land for all purposes under this Act."<br></blockquote>It provides, as is seen, that "whenever&nbsp; public lands *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; are conveyed&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; the same shall be brought forthwith under the operation of this Act and shall oecome registered&nbsp; lands,"&nbsp; This&nbsp; unquestionably&nbsp; means&nbsp; that the instant the sale is completed that instant they become registered lands; that&nbsp; when one proceeding, namely,&nbsp; the administrative proceeding for a&nbsp; patent under Act No. 926, is&nbsp; completed,&nbsp; its results shall be the same, so far as the unimpeachability of the title is concerned, as are the results which&nbsp; follow the judicial proceeding under Act. No. 496. But it emphatically does not say that&nbsp; any proceeding or any payment&nbsp; which is a condition precedent to that registration under the Torrens Law shall also be indispensable to the proceeding under the Public&nbsp; Land Law.&nbsp;&nbsp; When a proceeding under the Public Land Law is complete that is an end of it.&nbsp;&nbsp; It can not, without express provision of law, be opened in order to put in&nbsp; another condition to the completion of the&nbsp; proceeding.&nbsp;&nbsp; The evident intention&nbsp; of that section, as it is also of the Public Land Law, Act No. 926, is to keep the&nbsp; two proceedings wholly separate and&nbsp; distinct <i>while&nbsp; they are in progress</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each one shall proceed according to its&nbsp; own law,&nbsp; taking&nbsp; its own forms,&nbsp; pursuing&nbsp; its own methods,&nbsp; involving its own costs&nbsp; and&nbsp; expenses&nbsp; and <i>providing&nbsp; for its own fees and disbursements.&nbsp; The&nbsp; two proceedings,</i> as such, never touch,&nbsp; never come in contact. They are never involved with each other until both are fully terminated.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even&nbsp; then&nbsp; they do not touch.&nbsp;&nbsp; They simply have the same result by express provision of law; and that provision&nbsp; of law does absolutely nothing else than to affect <i>results.</i>&nbsp; It does not affect or touch <i>proceedings to obtain results.</i> That this is the intention of section 122 is apparent from the provisions of the Public Land Law, Act No, 926. Under that law public lands may be patented for any one of six different purposes.&nbsp; There is a separate and distinct proceeding required in each case.&nbsp; Each proceeding is complete in itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; The law states specifically and in detail what the applicant must do and what he must pay to obtain a patent. It also states that when he has done those things his patent shall be issued&nbsp; to him.&nbsp;&nbsp; He has done&nbsp; everything that the law requires.&nbsp;&nbsp; He has&nbsp; paid his full&nbsp; consideration.&nbsp; The proceeding is then complete&nbsp; in all of its essential features. Nothing remains to be done but to record the patent.&nbsp; This is purely a clerical matter in no sense affecting the essentials of the proceeding.&nbsp; But&nbsp; even&nbsp; this the patentee is not&nbsp; required to do.&nbsp; Section 122 expressly provides that the official shall cause the&nbsp; patent to be registered.&nbsp; It says: "It shall be <i>the duty of the official issuing the instrument of alienation&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; to cause such instrument, before its delivery to the grantee,&nbsp; to&nbsp; be filed with&nbsp; the register of deeds </i>for the province where the land lies&nbsp; <i>and to be there registered like&nbsp; other deeds and conveyances </i>&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *."<br><br>The quotation clearly concedes&nbsp; that the patentee has done all&nbsp; that the law requires him to do in order to bfhd the Government legally and morally&nbsp; to&nbsp; give&nbsp; him a title.&nbsp; The remainder, whatever it is, must be done by the Government itself.&nbsp; That title,&nbsp; having the Government&nbsp; back of it, is as good as it can be.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing can be added to it; nothing can be taken away from it.&nbsp; He stands upon the proceedings he has taken, upon consideration he has paid, and justly demands his title.<br><br>But, says the&nbsp; opinion of the court, and this is the central point of the decision, section 122 provides that "the fees for registration shall&nbsp; be&nbsp; paid by the grantee;" and&nbsp; then asks, in substance, "does this not mean that he shall pay the insurance fund assessment, and if not, why not?"&nbsp; The answer is&nbsp; "no;" and&nbsp; the&nbsp; reason&nbsp; is that the&nbsp; plain and unmistakable language of the section&nbsp; shows clearly that&nbsp; no such thing was&nbsp; intended&nbsp; or thought of.&nbsp; The section says that he shall&nbsp; pay the "fees&nbsp; for&nbsp; <i>registration"</i> not an <i>assurance fund</i> fee or assessment.&nbsp; The phrase "fees for <i>registration"</i> means what it says.&nbsp; It is an&nbsp; expression well known to the law.&nbsp; It has a known and definite signification. It is a fee for <i>registration</i>, not for insurance.&nbsp; It is something paid to a Government official for services performed by that official for the benefit of the payer&nbsp; and not a thing paid to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Government in trust for someone&nbsp; that the Government&nbsp; has unjustly deprived of his&nbsp; property.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a payment for valuable services rendered to the payee and not to purchase immunity for the Government or&nbsp; some one else&nbsp; for its&nbsp; or his unjust and spoliative&nbsp; acts committed against another.&nbsp;&nbsp; To hold that the expression&nbsp; "fees for registration" includes&nbsp; an assessment for an insurance is fo violate language and rob it of its significance.<br><br>Moreover,&nbsp; if anything more were needed to demonstrate the error involved in the construction given to said phrase by the court, it will be found in&nbsp; section 114 of the same Act. Act&nbsp; No. 496 is divided into headings, such as "Assurance Fund," "Powers of Attorney," "Lost Duplicate Certificates," "Adverse Claims,"&nbsp; "Surrender of Duplicate Certificates," etc.&nbsp; One of the divisions is headed in capital letters, "FEES FOR REGISTRATION."&nbsp; Under this heading comes every charge which may be made, as a fee, from the beginning of the proceeding to its close.&nbsp;&nbsp; That section reads:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">"FEES FOR REGISTRATION.<br></div><br>"SEC. 114.&nbsp;

of a payment to the insurance fund is not found here.<br><br>The Public Land&nbsp; Law&nbsp; requires the payment of no fees whatever except in cases of "unperfected titles and Spanish grants and concessions," and to establish the titles in those it is required by the law that <i>the full and complete proceeding&nbsp; under the Torrens Law must be taken.</i>&nbsp; In&nbsp; those cases the same payments are made as in the regular proceeding, except that to the assurance fund.&nbsp; In this law, then, there is no provision for&nbsp; fees which can possibly be construed to&nbsp; include a payment to the assurance fund.<br><br>Moreover, section 122&nbsp; provides, as we have&nbsp; seen, that the patent shall be&nbsp; "registered like other deeds and conveyances."&nbsp; These&nbsp; words, "deeds&nbsp; and conveyances," certainly can not mean the certified copy of the court's final decree in the judicial proceeding under Act No. 496, which is the instrument transmitted by the clerk of the court to the&nbsp; register&nbsp; of&nbsp; deeds in&nbsp; the&nbsp; province&nbsp; where the&nbsp; land lies, to be there registered as the final act of the proceeding; for the reason that neither such certified copy of the final decree nor the final decree itself is a&nbsp; "deed" or "conveyance."&nbsp; As I&nbsp; have said before,&nbsp; it transfers no title whatever; it conveys nothing.&nbsp; The person&nbsp; instituting the proceedings&nbsp; had&nbsp; title before&nbsp; he began.&nbsp; He was the&nbsp; owner before he made the application.&nbsp;&nbsp; He must be such under the law.&nbsp; The words&nbsp; "deed," "conveyance" mean unquestionably an instrument which transfers a title to or interest in real property from one person to&nbsp; another.&nbsp; Inasmuch as the registration of title under the Torrens Law <i>transfers absolutely nothing,</i> such registration can not possibly mean "deeds and conveyances" as those words are used in section 122.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a complete reply to&nbsp; that portion&nbsp; of the opinion which, after quoting&nbsp; from section 122 the&nbsp; words "to be there registered like other deeds and conveyances," says: "What&nbsp; does this phrase 'like other deeds and&nbsp; conveyances,' when&nbsp; applied to these&nbsp; patents&nbsp; and the registration of the&nbsp; same, mean ?&nbsp; It can only mean titles&nbsp; issued under said Act&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 496."&nbsp; The fundamental error embedded&nbsp; in this&nbsp; quotation,&nbsp; and&nbsp; it runs&nbsp; all&nbsp; through&nbsp; the decision, is that the Torrens Law <i>grants</i> or "issues titles." The&nbsp; law does&nbsp; nothing of the&nbsp; kind.&nbsp; It <i>guarantees </i>a&nbsp; title <i>already "issued"</i> or vested.&nbsp;&nbsp; As&nbsp; I have said repeatedly, the very first&nbsp; condition precedent to the institution&nbsp; of the proceeding under that law is that the <i>applicant must&nbsp; be the owner;</i>&nbsp; and that law&nbsp; specifically provides that if, during the proceedings, <i>it appears that he is&nbsp; not the owner the proceedings must be dismissed.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; The law&nbsp; simply confirms irrevocably&nbsp; a&nbsp; right&nbsp; already vested. The&nbsp; state,&nbsp; and it&nbsp; is the state acting through the law, can grant no rights which it does not have, can issue or grant no title which it&nbsp; does not possess.&nbsp; Its very purpose in promulgating the Torrens Law was to confirm a title which a court should find, after a judicial trial in an&nbsp; ordinary action, to&nbsp; have been legally vested in the applicant at the time the action was&nbsp; instituted.&nbsp;&nbsp; It confirms,&nbsp; not grants.&nbsp; It guarantees, not transfers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 38&nbsp; provides:<br><blockquote>"If the court&nbsp; after hearing finds that the applicant has title as stated in his application, and&nbsp; proper for registration,&nbsp; a decree&nbsp; of <i>confirmation and registration</i>&nbsp; shall&nbsp; be entered&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *."<br></blockquote>Therefore, when section 122&nbsp; used the words "to be there registered&nbsp; like other deeds and&nbsp; conveyances" it&nbsp; did not, by said words, in any sense refer to the final decree, or a certified copy thereof, as&nbsp; defined in the&nbsp; Torrens Law.&nbsp;&nbsp; It simply meant that the patent inasmuch as&nbsp; it is a deed&nbsp; or conveyance, should be registered or recorded in the same manner&nbsp; as&nbsp; any other deed&nbsp; or conveyance.&nbsp; That patent granted and&nbsp; transferred a title,&nbsp; an ownership, in exactly the same manner as would a deed of&nbsp; conveyance between John&nbsp; Doe and Richard Roe.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why, then, should it be&nbsp; recorded differently or under a different law?<br><br>All this goes to show simply that the Torrens Law has absolutely nothing to do with the <i>proceedings</i> for a patent under the Public Land Law.&nbsp;&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 122&nbsp; simply provides what&nbsp; shall be the effect, the result, <i>after&nbsp; the&nbsp; proceedings are terminated.</i><br><br>Entering upon the second phase of the&nbsp; question,&nbsp; I am of the opinion that section 122 of Act&nbsp; No. 496, if it means what&nbsp; the majority of the&nbsp; court&nbsp; conclude&nbsp; it means,&nbsp; is&nbsp; in violation of the&nbsp; Act of July&nbsp; 1, 1902.<br><br>It must be remembered, first of all, that the land involved in this action is <i>mineral </i> land.<br><br>It must be borne in mind also <i>that the only law in force in the Philippine Islands which has to do with the sale&nbsp; of mineral lands is the Act of July 1, 1902.</i><br><br>It is&nbsp; of the very&nbsp; greatest&nbsp; importance also to note that the Public Land Law is wholly inapplicable by&nbsp; express provision to the sale of <i>mineral</i> lands.<br><br>This&nbsp; inapplicability was lost&nbsp; sight&nbsp; of&nbsp; by the court in its decision.&nbsp; The opinion attempts to show that the Public Land Law is applicable to the case at bar, and for that purpose refers to said law as follows:<br><blockquote>"First. Sections&nbsp; 1 to 9,&nbsp; for patents to homesteads&nbsp; on the <i>public domain</i>."<br><br>Section 1,&nbsp; referred&nbsp; to, provides (the italics are mine):<br><br>"Section l.&nbsp; Any citizen of the&nbsp; Philippine Islands,&nbsp; or of the United States, or of any insular possession thereof, *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; may,&nbsp; as <i>hereinafter&nbsp; provided,</i> enter a homestead of not&nbsp; exceeding sixteen hectares of unoccupied, unreserved, unappropriated <i>agricultural </i>public&nbsp; land in the Philippine Islands&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *."<br></blockquote>Section 2, referred to,&nbsp; provides for the form and contents of the application for&nbsp; homestead, and says that&nbsp; one of the <i>necessary</i> allegations in&nbsp; the application shall be, "that the land applied&nbsp; for is nonmineral,&nbsp; does not&nbsp; contain valuable deposits of coal or salts, is more valuable for agricultural than forestry purposes and&nbsp; is not&nbsp; occupied by&nbsp; any other person."<br><br>The opinion&nbsp; further says:&nbsp; <br><blockquote>"Second. Sections 10 to 21, for sales of portions of the <i>public domain.</i>"<br></blockquote>Section 10, referred to,&nbsp; provides:<br><blockquote>"SEC.&nbsp; 10. Any citizen of the&nbsp; Philippine Islands,&nbsp; or&nbsp; of the United States, or of any insular possession&nbsp; thereof, or any corporation or&nbsp; like association of persons organized under the laws of the&nbsp; Philippine Islands, or of the United States,&nbsp; or of any&nbsp; State, Territory,&nbsp; or insular&nbsp; possession thereof, and&nbsp; authorized to transact&nbsp; business in the Philippine Islands, may&nbsp; purchase&nbsp; any&nbsp; tract of unoccupied, unappropriated, and unreserved <i>nonmineral</i> agricultural land in the Philippine&nbsp; Islands&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *."<br></blockquote>Section 12&nbsp; contains&nbsp; the requirement that the application must&nbsp; show affirmatively that&nbsp; the land applied for is&nbsp; <i>nonmineral.</i><br><br>The opinion further says:<br><blockquote>"Third.&nbsp; Sections 22 to 31, for leases of a portion of the <i>public domain.</i>"<br><br>Section&nbsp; 22, referred to, provides:<br><br>"Any citizen of the United States,&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; may lease any tract&nbsp; of&nbsp; unoccupied, unreserved,<i> nonmineral</i> agricultural public lands&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *."<br></blockquote>Section&nbsp; 24&nbsp; requires&nbsp; that&nbsp; the application for the&nbsp; lease must contain&nbsp; the statement that the land is&nbsp; "nonmineral in character." <br><br>The opinion further&nbsp; says:<br><blockquote>"Fourth. Sections 32 to 35, for free patents to individual settlers on portions of the public domain."</blockquote>These sections constitute Chapter IV of the Public Land Law.&nbsp; Said chapter&nbsp; is&nbsp; headed: "Free Patents&nbsp; to&nbsp; Native Settlers."&nbsp; Section 32&nbsp; provides:<br><blockquote><i>"Any native of the Philippine Islands </i> now&nbsp; an occupant <i>and cultivator </i>of unreserved, unappropriated <i>agricultural</i> public land,&nbsp; as defined by the&nbsp; Act of Congress of&nbsp; July first, nineteen hundred and two,&nbsp; who&nbsp; has<i> continuously occupied and cultivated</i> such land&nbsp; *&nbsp; * .&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; since August first, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight; or who, prior to August first,&nbsp; eighteen hundred and&nbsp; ninety-eight, continuously occupied and <i>cultivated&nbsp; </i>such&nbsp; land for&nbsp; three years immediately prior&nbsp; to said date, and who has&nbsp; been&nbsp; continuously since July fourth, nineteen hundred and two,&nbsp; until the date of the taking&nbsp; effect of this Act, an occupant and <i>cultivator</i> of such land, shall be entitled&nbsp; to&nbsp; have a&nbsp; patent issued&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *."</blockquote>Section 33&nbsp; requires&nbsp; that&nbsp; the petition&nbsp; presented under this chapter shall show that the applicant is a <i>native&nbsp; of the Philippine Islands.</i><br><br>The opinion further says:<br><blockquote>"Sixth.&nbsp; Sections&nbsp; 54&nbsp; to 67, for&nbsp; unperfected titles&nbsp; and Spanish grants and concessions of&nbsp; the <i>public domain."</i></blockquote>These sections compose Chapter VI of said Public Land Law.&nbsp; It is headed: "Unperfected titles and Spanish Grants and Concessions."<br><br>Section 54 provides:<br><blockquote>"The following-described persons or their&nbsp; legal successors in&nbsp; right,&nbsp; occupying&nbsp; public lands in the&nbsp; Philippine Islands, or claiming to own any such lands or an interest therein, but whose titles to such lands have not been perfected, may apply <i> to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of Land&nbsp; Registration</i> of the Philippine Islands&nbsp; for confirmation of their&nbsp; claims and the issuance of a certificate of title therefor,&nbsp; to wit:<br><br>"1.

That in case of conflicting claims upon coal lands where the improvements shall be commenced after the date of the passage of this Act, priority of possession and improvement, followed by proper filing and continued good faith,&nbsp; shall determine&nbsp; the preference right&nbsp; to purchase. And also where improvements have already been made prior to the&nbsp; passage of this Act, division&nbsp; of the&nbsp; land claimed may be made&nbsp; by legal subdivisions, which shall conform as nearly as practicable with the subdivisions of land provided for in this Act,&nbsp; to include as near as may&nbsp; be the valuable&nbsp; improvements&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; respective&nbsp;&nbsp; parties.&nbsp; The Government of the Philippine Islands is&nbsp; authorized to issue all needful rules and regulations<i> for carrying&nbsp; into effect the provisions of this and preceding sections&nbsp; relating&nbsp; to mineral lands." </i><br><br>"SEC,&nbsp; 59. That no Act&nbsp; granting lands to provinces, districts, or municipalities to aid in the construction of roads, or for other public purposes,<i> shall&nbsp; be so construed as&nbsp; to embrace mineral lands, which, in all cases,&nbsp; are reserved exclusively, unless otherwise specially provided&nbsp; in the Act or Acts making the grant.</i><br><br>"SEC.&nbsp; 60. That nothing in this Act shall&nbsp; be construed to affect the&nbsp; rights&nbsp; of any person, partnership, or&nbsp; corporation having a valid, perfected mining concession granted prior to April&nbsp; eleventh, eighteen hundred and ninety-nine, but all such concessions shall be conducted under the provisions of the law in force at the&nbsp; time they were granted, subject&nbsp; at all&nbsp; times to cancellation by reason of illegality in the&nbsp; procedure by which&nbsp; they were&nbsp; obtained, or for failure to comply with the conditions prescribed as requisite to their retention in the&nbsp; laws&nbsp; under&nbsp; which&nbsp; they were granted: <i>Provided,</i> That the owner or owners&nbsp; of every such concession&nbsp; shall cause the corners made by its&nbsp; boundaries to be distinctly marked with permanent monuments&nbsp; within six months after this Act has been promulgated in the Philippine Islands,&nbsp; and that any concessions&nbsp; the&nbsp; boundaries of which are not so marked within this period shall&nbsp; be free and open&nbsp; to explorations&nbsp; and purchase&nbsp; under&nbsp; the provisions of this Act.<br><br>"SEC.&nbsp; 61.<i> That&nbsp; mining&nbsp; rights&nbsp; on public lands in&nbsp; the, Philippine Islands shall, after the passage&nbsp; of this Act, be acquired only in accordance with its provisions."</i></blockquote>These&nbsp; are the only provisions of the Act of July 1, 1902, which&nbsp; touch the question&nbsp; of&nbsp; mineral lands.&nbsp; From&nbsp; these provisions we see:<br><br><ol><li>That there is provided a complete proceeding for the sale of mineral&nbsp; lands.&nbsp; Nothing whatever essential to the proceeding is omitted&nbsp; or left to be done by others.&nbsp; The proceeding provided for is absolutely&nbsp; complete from&nbsp; the "staking" of the claim to the issuance of the patent.<br><br></li><li>That the Government of&nbsp; the Philippine&nbsp; Islands is prohibited in&nbsp; express terms from intervening in&nbsp; any way in the proceeding except in a manner wholly&nbsp; clerical&nbsp; or mechanical.&nbsp;&nbsp; Every line&nbsp; of the law leads inevitably to this conclusion.&nbsp; Section 36 provides that the Philippine Commission "may make such regulations, <i>not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act,</i> governing the&nbsp; location, manner of recording,&nbsp; and&nbsp; amount of&nbsp; work necessary to hold possession of a mining claim,<i> subject to the following requirements:" </i>&nbsp; The following section then&nbsp; provides&nbsp; fully&nbsp; the amount of work required, when it shall be performed, and what shall be the result in case it&nbsp; is not&nbsp; performed&nbsp; as required. Section 37 provides expressly how a&nbsp; patent for mineral&nbsp; lands shall&nbsp; be obtained.&nbsp; It&nbsp; sets out the "requirements&nbsp; fully and&nbsp; in detail and provides that after complying with the conditions in that section expressed, the applicant "<i>shall&nbsp; thereupon</i> be entitled to a patent for the land, in the manner&nbsp; following:" The section&nbsp; then&nbsp; provides&nbsp; that&nbsp; the applicant shall&nbsp; file certain notes,&nbsp; notices,&nbsp; affidavits, and certificates;&nbsp; that a certain&nbsp; notice shall be published and posted for sixty days; that after&nbsp; such time "it shall&nbsp; be assumed that the applicant is&nbsp; entitled to a patent <i> upon the payment </i> to&nbsp; the provincial treasurer or the&nbsp; collector of internal revenue of <i>five dollars per acre </i>and that no adverse claim exists, and therefore no objection from third parties to the&nbsp; issuance of a patent shall&nbsp; be heard, <i>except it be shown&nbsp; that&nbsp; the applicant has failed to&nbsp; comply with the terms of&nbsp; this Act."<br><br></i></li><li>That the applicant and the Government of the United&nbsp; States&nbsp; (not&nbsp; the Philippine&nbsp; Government),&nbsp; by&nbsp; these provisions, enter into a special relation, the one making an offer to sell&nbsp; lands and the other accepting&nbsp; the offer and performing the conditions named therein; that the terms of that offer are set forth fully in those provisions; that it clearly&nbsp; and explicitly appears therefrom what the applicant must do, and <i>all he must do,</i> to obtain his patent; that it is plainly set forth what&nbsp; shall be the result of a performance&nbsp; of the conditions.&nbsp; Now, while I have no doubt that the Philippine Government&nbsp; has full&nbsp; power, as&nbsp; stated in section 57, to make "rules and regulations for carrying into effect the provisions of this and the preceding sections relating to mineral lands," it must<i> carry those provisions into effect,</i><i>onerous to the applicant.</i>&nbsp; The terms of the offer are fixed by&nbsp; the&nbsp; United States.&nbsp; None may&nbsp; take&nbsp; away&nbsp; or add to them.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is&nbsp; undoubtedly proper for the Philippine Government to require the patent to be recorded in a particular place and to say&nbsp; who shall&nbsp; pay the recording fee.&nbsp; But it has&nbsp; no right to say that the patentee shall do other things&nbsp; and pay other moneys <i>as a condition precedent to obtain title,</i> when the Government of the United States has stated specifically&nbsp; that he shall&nbsp; be entitled to a patent, a title, <i>when he&nbsp; has done the things and paid the moneys specified in&nbsp; that Act</i>&nbsp; In other words,&nbsp; the Government of the United States, through the statute, says to the applicant: "You do the things&nbsp; which we specify herein and I will give you a&nbsp; perfect title to certain mineral lands." The applicant&nbsp; meets fully&nbsp; the&nbsp; conditions named&nbsp; in the offer of the Government.&nbsp; Whereupon the Government, on its part, issues the title.&nbsp; But at this point the Philippine Government, by section&nbsp; 122 of Act No. 496,&nbsp; steps in and says: "That title that you&nbsp; have&nbsp; just&nbsp; received&nbsp; from the United States is not a title or patent at&nbsp; all.&nbsp; It is not what the Government of the United States represented it to be. It does&nbsp; not have at all the&nbsp; effect which the United States said that it should.&nbsp; It <i>'shall not&nbsp; take&nbsp; effect as a&nbsp; conveyance to bind the land,</i>&nbsp; but shall operate only as a <i>contract</i> between the Government and the grantee; the act of <i>registration&nbsp; shall&nbsp; be&nbsp; the&nbsp; operative act&nbsp; to&nbsp; convey the lands.'</i> Before you can have a&nbsp; title, a patent,&nbsp; you must pay the Insular&nbsp; Government an&nbsp; assessment for assurance, a&nbsp; sum of money to guarantee the&nbsp; title which&nbsp; the Government of the United States already&nbsp; guarantees.&nbsp; The Government of the United States was&nbsp; mistaken when it&nbsp; said that all you had to do to obtain&nbsp; a perfect title was to perform the conditions specified in the&nbsp; Act of&nbsp; July&nbsp; 1, 1902.&nbsp; We have one other condition to add, one that the&nbsp; Government of the United&nbsp; States neglected&nbsp; to&nbsp; impose, and if you don't meet this condition also, we shall declare the proceedings had between you and the Government of&nbsp; the United States, in effect,&nbsp; nugatory."</li></ol> not change them, nor&nbsp; insert new&nbsp; provisions, nor&nbsp; add new, other or different provisions&nbsp; or conditions <br>It needs no argument to demonstrate&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; Insular Government&nbsp; has&nbsp; no power to alter in&nbsp; a material way&nbsp; a statute of the United States (U. S. <i>vs.</i> Bull, 15 Phil. Rep., 7) or to add anything whatever to those conditions laid down by a statute of the United States&nbsp; as being by the terms of said&nbsp; statute the only&nbsp; conditions required&nbsp; to be met in order to&nbsp; obtain&nbsp; a title&nbsp; to&nbsp; public&nbsp; lands.&nbsp; If the&nbsp; Insular Government&nbsp; may&nbsp; add one&nbsp; material condition,&nbsp; it may add others,&nbsp; and thus change entirely the relation established between&nbsp; the Government of the&nbsp; United States&nbsp; and the applicant.&nbsp; The right to&nbsp; alter is the right to&nbsp; abrogate.&nbsp; If section 122 is operative as to mineral lands in the manner claimed&nbsp; by the&nbsp; court, then the Insular Government has changed so essentially the proceedings for&nbsp; a patent to mineral lands, provided in the Philippine Bill, as to destroy the vested rights of one&nbsp; who has done&nbsp; his work&nbsp; and paid his money in reliance upon a promise of the United States Government.<br><br>Moreover, the Act of July 1, 1902, provides that third parties who&nbsp; prior to the sale had an interest in the mineral lands&nbsp; sold and&nbsp; who&nbsp; were threatened with an unjust&nbsp; and illegal deprivation of such interest&nbsp; by reason&nbsp; of the applicant's failure to comply with the terms of the Act, may come&nbsp; in even after&nbsp; the&nbsp; issuance of the patent&nbsp; and set aside the proceedings, recovering the land itself in a proper case.&nbsp; Section 122, however, by bringing the title to&nbsp; mineral lands under the Torrens&nbsp; Law,&nbsp; effectually and&nbsp; irrevocably cuts off the rights of third parties thus guaranteed by the Philippine Bill.&nbsp; Under the conception of the court after registration under section&nbsp; 122 the title to the lands becomes absolutely secure not&nbsp; only against&nbsp; all&nbsp; persons who had rights&nbsp; in the land before&nbsp; registration,&nbsp; but<i> also against the&nbsp; Government&nbsp; of the United States&nbsp; itself. </i> So that, after the lapse&nbsp; of one year, no matter how&nbsp; flagrant and&nbsp; vicious&nbsp; may&nbsp; have been&nbsp; the&nbsp; fraud practiced&nbsp; upon the Government of the United States or upon any other interested&nbsp; party by the patentee in obtaining his patent, the&nbsp; Government&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; United&nbsp; States,&nbsp; as&nbsp; well as&nbsp; the party, is, by section&nbsp; 122,&nbsp; absolutely prohibited from disturbing&nbsp; him&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; enjoyment of&nbsp; his&nbsp; tainted title.&nbsp; If the Insular Government can&nbsp; not protect him as fully as it does all others who bring their lands under the Torrens Law, it has&nbsp; no&nbsp; right&nbsp; to take the money.&nbsp; It protects all others from&nbsp; their vendors as well as other persons.&nbsp; It should protect the applicant in the same way.<br><ol start="4"><li>&nbsp;That the officers of the Insular Government who participate in the proceedings for the sale&nbsp; of <i>mineral</i> lands do so&nbsp; as agents of the Government of the United States rather than&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Insular Government.</li></ol>It is a question of extreme doubt whether a&nbsp; person injured by the sale by the United States Government of a mineral claim to&nbsp; an applicant would have the&nbsp; right to resort&nbsp; to the assurance fund.&nbsp; Section 101 of Act No,&nbsp; 496, as&nbsp; amended by section 12 of Act No.&nbsp; 1699, would need to be&nbsp; strained to the breaking point in order to include within its terms such&nbsp; person.<br><br>It&nbsp; is also a matter of some&nbsp; doubt&nbsp; whether&nbsp; the purely administrative&nbsp; proceeding1 followed in&nbsp; cases of&nbsp; sales&nbsp; of mineral lands affords that due&nbsp; process of&nbsp; law&nbsp; to those persons who have an interest in the lands conveyed which is required before one may be deprived&nbsp; of&nbsp; his property&nbsp; to the extent&nbsp; provided in the Torrens Law. It is certainly widely&nbsp; different from the proceedings&nbsp; followed&nbsp; under said Act No. 496.<br><br>In&nbsp; view of all this I&nbsp; am confident&nbsp; that the&nbsp; Philippine Government never&nbsp; intended that section 122 of&nbsp; Act No. 496 should be given the meaning&nbsp; accorded it by the decision of&nbsp; this&nbsp; court.<br><br>Giving section&nbsp; 122 all the signification which it was intended to have, it simply requires that a patent t5 mineral lands shall be&nbsp; registered "like&nbsp; other&nbsp;&nbsp; deeds and&nbsp; conveyances."&nbsp;&nbsp; The provisions&nbsp; of the law are&nbsp; express and mandatory,&nbsp; leaving no&nbsp; discretion whatever in the register of deeds.&nbsp; This is apparent and clear on&nbsp; reading the section. (Marbury<i> vs. </i>Madison, 1&nbsp; Cranch., 172.)&nbsp; While the section provides that the official shall cause the patent to be registered, I am&nbsp; of the opinion that the patentee has a sufficient interest to compel&nbsp; the registration.<br><br>The mandamus should be issued.<br></div>
