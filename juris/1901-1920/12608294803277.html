				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Before the Court of First Instance of  Pampanga, Fausto Basilio was charged by the fiscal of said province with the crime of abuses against chastity in that, at about 6 p. m. on the 3d  of April, 1906, the young  woman  Marcelina Dy-Oco being then  and  there  in the house of Casimiro Macapagal, wjiich is situated in the barrio of Santa Lucia, town of  San Fernando, the accused willfully and feloniously and lewdly abused the said young woman.</p>
<p>From the record of the case the following facts appear to have been proven:  That on  the  evening  in  question Marcelina Dy-Oco was  a visitor at the house  of Casimiro Macapagal in San Fernando;  that as she approached the door to the upper story at the side of  the  stairway in company with Lucia Macapagal, the daughter of the OAvner of the house, and another woman named Eugenia David, the  accused, who was  also in the house and  apparently waiting for her near the aforesaid door,  suddenly placed himself behind  Marcelina and seized  her by the  waist, caught her breast,  and kissed her,  trying to drag her toward a small room of the house, and refusing to let her go in spite of the efforts made  by the other women to free her  from her assailant; that for this reason  the women cried out and thereupon two neighbors,  named Hilarion Yusi and Santiago Yusi, went to her assistance; the first named  seized the accused  and with a push  made him release his hold.</p>
<p>It should be noticed, however, that the offended party was well acquainted with the accused, although she never had  anything to do  with him because he is married to a cousin of hers, and as he has a house  of his own the statement that  the accused, livfid in  the house where the affair occurred is not  true.</p>
<p>The fact described above constitutes the crime of abuses against chastity,  defined and punished under article 439 of the Penal Code,  inasmuch  as  the. external acts  committed against the person of the injured party, as seen by the witnesses present, are not characteristic of the crime of attempted rape, nor of an intent to commit such offense, but do  constitute  the offense of abuses against  chastity and are contrary to good morals.</p>
<p>The supreme court of Spain,  upon establishing  the rule as to the application of an article of the Penal Code similar to the one  in force in these  Islands, declared in its judgment in cassation  rendered  on the 7th of October, 1890, that:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"In attempted crime, it is an essential condition  that the external acts which  constitute the offense  be directed with a constant intent toward the commission of an offense punished by law; that by reason of the absence of such intent and of its necessary tendency, and also for reasons of moral order, the voluntary desistance of the guilty party excludes the attempt from punishment; that such desistance does not imply the absolute irresponsibility of the guilty party with respect to acts previously committed by him if the same constitute by themselves a crime, for the reason  that, as  they  were freely carried  out,  they Ure within the nature of a consummated crimesâ€”that is, they involve the voluntary character of the act, and the actual damage done to a lawful right; and further, because if the desistance on account of its relation to the intended purpose weakens the connection between the latter to the acts prosecuted and prevents the punishment of the attempt or other offense, not for the damage  inflicted but in part for that intended, this in no wise affects either past or anterior acts which violated  other rights."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Would the act of forcibly placing the hand between the legs of a woman  over  12 years of  age, or without force if she  be  under that  age,  constitute the crime of abuses against chastity or simply an offense against good morals? The supreme court of Spain has decided that the former and the more serious classification is the proper one:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Considering that the act committed by the appellant, described in the first  question  in the case, it not  being done over and above  the clothing of the young woman, *  *  *   is  unquestionably. one  of  the abuses  against chastity, which abuses when  committed under any of the circumstances that characterize the crime of rape, among which is the use of  force, constitute the crime punished by article 454 of the code, properly applied by the  trial court because it has  been set  forth that the appellant employed force in carrying out the acts duly proven."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The accused in this ease, Avho did not plead guilty, states that on the evening in question he had a conversation with the injured girl at the house of Oasimiro Macapagal, where he lived, and Avhere the said girl, whom the deponent was courting, used to call; but he denied the acts attributed to him in the complaint, and. in order to prove his allegation he cited  a resident,  Ramon Dayrit,  who by his testimony confirmed  the truth of the charge since he  stated that upon hearing the noise in the house he  went to it and there found  Hilarion Yusi,  who  had seized the  accused, thus  confirming  the fact that it was this witness who separated 'Fausto Basilio from the injured party, Marcelina Dy-Oco, whom  he  was embracing and would not release; the fact that the accused had amorous  relations with  the said girl, which, however,  has not been proved, not being sufficient to justify the abuse committed by him. The culpability of the accused as the proven and convicted author of the crime  of abuses against chastity is evident.</p>
<p>In the commission of this  crime no aggravating nor extenuating circumstance is present; therefore, the adequate penalty should be imposed in its medium degree.</p>
<p>For the reasons above set forth, it is our opinion that the judgment appealed  from should be affirmed.   Fausto Basilio is therefore sentenced to the penalty of three years and seven months of <em>prision correctional</em>, to the accessory penalties of article 61 of the Penal  Code,  one-half of the time of his detention to be allowed in his favor, and to pay the costs of this instance.  So ordered.</p>
