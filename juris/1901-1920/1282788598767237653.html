				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The plaintiff amended his complaint in this action after a demurrer thereto 
had been sustained. No new or additional facts have been alleged and the case 
stands precisely where it stood before the amended complaint was filed. A 
demurrer having been offered to the amended complaint, that also must be 
sustained.
<p>The plaintiff still insists with great vigor that section 1 of Act No. 1748; 
entitled "An Act authorizing the adjustment of provincial and municipal 
boundaries and authorizing the change of capitals of provinces and subproyinces, 
as may be necessary from time to time to serve the public convenience and 
interest," is in violation of the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902, in that it 
delegates legislative powers to the Governor-General, whereas the Act of 
Congress referred to lodges those powers in the Philippine Legislature.</p>
<p>Section 1 of the Act referred to provides in substance that, whenever in the 
judgment of the Governor-General the public welfare requires, he may, by 
executive order, enlarge, contract, or otherwise change the boundary of any 
province, subprovince, municipality, or township or other political subdivision, 
or separate any such subdivision into such portions as may be required, merge 
any of such subdivisions with another, divide any province into one or more 
subdivisions as may be required, name any new subdivision so created, change the 
seat of government within any subdivision existing or created thereunder, to 
such place therein as the public interests require, and shall fix in such 
executive order the date when the change, merger, separation or other action 
shall take effect. The section also provides that whenever the Governor-General 
creates a new political subdivision he shall appoint such officers for the new 
subdivision with such powers and duties as may be required by the existing 
provisions of law applicable to the case and fix their salaries; and that such 
appointees shall hold office until their successors are appointed or elected and 
qualify. Successors to the elective offices shall be elected at the next general 
election following such appointment.</p>
<p>The contention of the plaintiff ;s not well founded. The delegation of the 
power referred to on the Governor-General does not involve an abdication of 
legislative functions on the part of the legislature with regard to the 
particular subject-matter with which it authorizes the Governor-General to deal. 
It is simply a transference of certain details with respect to provinces, 
municipalities, and townships, many of them newly created, and all of them 
subject to more or less rapid change both in development and centers of 
population, the proper regulation of which might require not only prompt action 
but action of such a detailed character as not to permit the legislative body, 
as such, to take it efficiently. We find no provision of the Act applicable so 
far as it touches this case which is in violation of the Act of Congress of July 
1, 1902.</p>
<p>The demurrer is sustained and the complaint is finally dismissed, with costs. 
So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Carson, Trent</em>, and <em>Araullo, JJ</em>., concur.</p></div>
