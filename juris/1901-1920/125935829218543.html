				G.R. No. 493, November 25, 1902</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE, VS. ANTONIO ACUNA ET ALV DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>LADD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> The appellants were convicted in the Court of  First Instance of Iloilo, under article 343 of the Penal Code, which punishes  the bankers and proprietors of gaming houses  (<em>casas de juego de suerte, envite o azar</em>) and the players in such houses.</p>
<p> Upon  complaint of the provincial fiscal to the Court of First Instance,  setting forth that he had received information  to the  effect  that unlawful gaming was being carried on in the house in question, the judge, accompanied by  the fiscal,  the clerk, and other officers  of  the court, visited the house on  the evening of April 30,  1901, and found a  number of persons there engaged in playing the game known as  "monte," among others  the six appellants convicted as players, and Jacinto Ramos who was acting as banker.  The usual apparatus of the game was found in use, and, together with some 89 pesos in money, was seized by direction of the judge,  and has  been declared forfeited in the judgment under article 345 of the Penal Code, providing that  "the money or other articles and the instruments and tools used in gambling or raffles shall be confiscated."</p>
<p> Antonio Acuna is admitted to have been the lessee of the premises during the period  covered by the evidence, and may be held responsible as proprietor.  (Judgment of the supreme court of Spain of January 10, 1882.)</p>
<p> It is claimed by  counsel for the appellant Teaiio  that his client was not a  participant  in the game but  was present as  a mere spectator.  The act, drawn  up under the authority  of the judge reciting what was discovered and done at the time the premises were visited, states that Teano was  one of the players, and we find nothing in the evidence to  justify  the conclusion  that that fact was incorrectly stated. The only substantial question to  be determined  is whether the house was a gaming house (<em>casa do juego  de suerte, envite o azar</em>),  that is, "a house specially devoted to the encouragement or promotion" (<em>dedicada al fomento o mantenimiento</em>) of gaming.  (Judgment of the supreme court of Spain of December 28, 1887.)</p>
<p> Mariano  Nara testified  that he  had been in  the house and had seen gambling going on there on an occasion distinct from that when the house was raided.  The evidence of Ceferino M. Fontbuena is to the  same effect.  And  Perfecto  Izar, whose evidence we regard as substantially unimpeached, testified  that he had been employed by Antonio Acuna to bring players to the house, receiving as compensation for his services  a percentage of  the profits.</p>
<p> To  rebut this positive evidence,  as to the character  of the house, we have only the statements  of a number  of witnesses who, in substance, merely say that  they  had never heard of gambling  being  carried on in the house except on the evening of the  raid.</p>
<p> The evidence furnished by the nature of the things found in  the house by the judge also tends strongly to establish the character of the house, and on the whole we are unable to  see  any room for doubt  that unlawful gaming was carried on  there as a business by the lessee.  It is true that the lessee had  only occupied the house a short time when the raid occurred, but we apprehend that the length of time during which the unlawful business had continued can have no materiality when once it is shown that such business had  been  established on the premises.</p>
<p> The judgment of the court below is affirmed, with  costs, and the case  is remanded to that court for the execution of the judgment.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>  Arellano, C. J., Torres, Cooper, Smith,</em> and <em>Willard, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em>Mapa, J.,</em> disqualified.</p>
