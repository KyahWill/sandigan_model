				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. ZACARIAS ESTOPIA ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">At the time when Zacarias Estopia, Dalmacio Daonoto, and Patricio PaJgan were 
about to sit down to supper in the house of Benito Moso, who had invited them 
for the celebration of his saint's day, Antonio Carreon, who was another of the 
guests and was also about to eat supper, inadvertently-stepped on Dalmacio 
Daonoto's foot, and, notwithstanding his apology, Daonoto, preceded by the other 
two guests, Zacarias Estopia and Patricio Palgan, forcibly took him to the lower 
part of the house. Once below, Daonoto held Carreon fast by the neck and Palgan 
raised up his arms so that he might not offer any resistance, and while in this 
position Zacarias Estopia thrust a dagger into his abdomen. As a result of the 
wound the victim died on the following day. Such are the facts disclosed by the 
testimony given <em>in articulo mortis</em> by Carreon, corroborated in all 
their details by the eyewitnesses Juan Saquin, Melquiades Saquin, and Benito 
Moso. The defendants' counsel himself says in this instance that it is entirely 
beyond doubt and discussion, as admitted by all, that it was the defendant 
Zacarias Estopia who inflicted the dagger thrust, that this assault took place 
at the foot of the stairs of the house of Benito Moso, that the cause of the 
quarrel was the treading on Daonoto's foot, and that, on account of the quarrel, 
all the guests in the said house ran away. (Brief, p. 3.) The defense concludes 
that the crime was one of simple homicide and that the person solely liable 
therefor was Zacarias Estopia.
<p>With respect to the participation of Zacarias Estopia, the trial court 
classified the crime as murder, attended by the qualifying circumstances of 
premeditation and treachery, in addition to the generic one of abuse of superior 
strength; and as regards Dalmacio Dapnoto and Patricio Palgan, also as murder, 
with the generic aggravating circumstances defined in Nos. 9 and 14 of article 
10 of the Penal Code. He sentenced all three to suffer the penalty of death.</p>
<p>On the occasion that Antonio Carreon was killed, Zacarias Estopia also 
wounded Melquiades Saquin by stabbing him through the left forearm, likewise 
with a dagger; but this crime was neither included in the complaint nor in the 
sentence. The three defendants were only charged with and sentenced for the 
murder of Antonio Carreon. It is important that this point appear of record, in 
order that the facts relative to the said Melquiades Saquin may not be 
considered as <em>res judicata</em> in this case.</p>
<p>The crime is properly classified as murder, not on account of the qualifying 
circumstance of premeditation, which did not concur in the commission thereof, 
for the quarrel arose unexpectedly and no one had thought of it before it 
occurred, but because of treachery, which without the slightest doubt did exist. 
It is improper to take account of the aggravating circumstance of superior 
strength, inasmuch as it was precisely the aid and participation of Daonoto and 
Palgan that constituted the method which tended directly and especially to 
insure the commission of the crime without such risk to the person of Estopia as 
might have arisen from any defense which Carreon might have been able to make, 
and further because such acts performed by the said Daonoto and Palgan 
constituted the treacherous manner of committing the crime. They are 
coprincipals, both being responsible for the death thus caused, and should be 
punished in the same degree as the defendant Estopia.</p>
<p>The two circumstances enumerated in the judgment, with respect to Daonoto and 
Palgan, are the ninth, abuse of superior strength, and the fourteenth, "that the 
crime be committed with the aid of armed men, or of persons who insure or afford 
impunity." Neither of these should be taken into consideration, because one is 
included in the treachery and the other is inapplicable to the case.</p>
<p>The crime committed is, therefore, simply that of murder, for which the law 
imposes the penalty of <em>cadena temporal</em> in its maximum degree up to 
death. The penalty should be imposed in the medium degree, that is, <em>cadena 
perpetua,</em> as the Solicitor-General recommends in this instance, but since 
the three defendants must be allowed the benefits of article 11 of the Penal 
Code, owing to their lack of education, the degree applicable is the 
minimum.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from is reversed and Zacarias Estopia, Dalmacio 
Daonoto, and Patricio Palgan are hereby sentenced to twenty years of <em>cadena 
temporal </em>and the accessory penalties, to indemnify the family of the 
deceased in the sum of P1,000, and to pay, each of them, one-third of the costs 
of both instances.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Johnson, Carson, Moreland</em>, and <em>Araullo, JJ.,</em> 
concur.<br></p></div>
