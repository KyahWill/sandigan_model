				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Section 5  of the act of Congress of March 3, 1903 (32 Stat.  L., 1213), is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"That for every violation of any of the provisions of section four of  this act the person, partnership, company, or corporation  violating the same, by knowingly assisting, encouraging, or  soliciting the migration  or importation of any  alien to  the United States to perform labor or service  of any kind by reason  of any offer, solicitation, promise, or agreement, express or implied, parol or special, to or  with such alien, shall  forfeit and pay for every such offense  the sum  of one thousand dollars, which may be sued for  and recovered by  the  United States, or  by any person who shall first bring his action therefor in his own name and for  his own benefit,  including any such alien thus promised labor or service of any kind as aforesaid, as debts of like amount are now recovered in the courts of the United States; and separate suits may be brought for each alien thus promised labor or service of any kind as aforesaid.  And it shall be the duty of the district attorney of the proper district to prosecute  every such suit  when brought  by the United States."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This law is in force in these Islands.   (<em>In re</em> Allen,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 1 Off. Gaz., 782.)</p>
<p>The plaintiff,  an  alien, having  been induced  by the defendant to come to the Philippine Islands in violation of  the  law,  brought  this action in the  Court of  First Instance of Manila to recover the penalty of $1,000 mention ed in  said section 5.  He had  judgment below, and defendant has brought the case here by bill of exceptions.</p>
<p>The only question presented is whether a Court of First Instance  in  the Islands  has jurisdiction of  an  action brought by an individual under section 5 above quoted, to recover the penalty therein mentioned.</p>
<p>Act No. 136 of the Commission, in defining the original jurisdiction of Courts of First Instance, says, in  section 56, that they shall have jurisdiction—</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"3. In all cases in which the demand, exclusive of interest, or the value of the  property in controversy, amounts to one hundred dollars  or more."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The jurisdiction  thus conferred upon Courts of  First Instance was confirmed  by Congress before the passage of the act of March 3, 1903.   [Act of July 1,  1902,  section 9  (32 U.  S. Stat.  L., 691).]  The demand  in  this case being for more than $100, the Court of First Instance had jurisdiction of  the  suit,  unless there is something  in the act of March 3, 1903, or  in some other law, which deprives it of that jurisdiction.   (U. S. <em>vs</em>. Sweet, 1 Phil. Rep., 18.)</p>
<p>This jurisdiction was  not taken away by section 29 of the act, for  that simply  confers jurisdiction upon the circuit and district courts of  the  United States, but does not make that jurisdiction exclusive.</p>
<p>The principal argument of the defendant, however, is that that provision of section 5 which says that the sum of $1,000 may be  sued for and  recovered "as debts  of like amount are now recovered in the courts of  the  United States" indicates that the only courts  in  which such an action can be maintained are the circuit and district courts of the United States, and he says  in his brief that the plaintiff in this case is  not  without remedy,  for  he can maintain  an  action in a district  or  circuit  court of the United States if he can  find the defendant in the district to which such court pertains.</p>
<p>The contention  of  the defendant  would  lead to the result that an action for this penalty could not be maintained in any Territory of the United States, for although the territorial  courts  are vested  with all  the  powers of district and  circuit courts of the United States,  yet  that does not make them such courts.  (McAllister <em>vs</em>.  V. S,, 141 U. S., 174..)  It also leads to the conclusion that such an action could not be maintained in Porto Rico or in Hawaii, for although courts have been established in those islands which are called district courts of the United States, yet they are not established by virtue of the provision  of the Constitution of  the United States relating  to the judicial power, but are established by virtue of other powers  vested in Congress.</p>
<p>We agree,  however,  with counsel for the plaintiff,  that the claim of the defendant in this respect is met by the case of Lees <em>vs</em>. United States (150 U. S., 476).  That was an action brought in a district court of the United  States by the United States to recover the penalty of $1,000 by virtue of the provisions of the act of February 26, 1885. The third section of that act is  very  similar to the fifth section of the present act, and it provides that where there is a violation thereof—</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The offender shall forfeit and pay for every such offense the sum  of one  thousand dollars, which may be sued for and recovered  by the United States,  or  by any person who shall first  bring  his action  therefor,  including  any such alien or foreigner who may be a party  to any such contract or agreement, as debts  of  like amount are  now recovered in  the circuit courts of the United States."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was claimed in that case that this provision  of the law  conferred  exclusive  jurisdiction  upon  the  circuit court.  The Supreme Court did not agree with this contention.  It said, among other things (page 479):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"It in effect provides that although the recovery of a penalty is a proceeding criminal  in its nature, yet in  this class of cases it may be  enforced in a civil action, and in the same manner that debts are recovered in the ordinary civil courts."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And again:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"But taking the clause as a whole, giving force to all its words, it would seem to refer to the form of the action rather than to the forum."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore,  even if we consider  that  the  words "in the courts of the United States" refer only to the circuit and district courts, as  claimed by the appellant, this phrase does not, under the authority of  Lees  <em>vs</em>. United States, mean that  the action must be brought in those courts to the exclusion of all others.   It would not, therefore, take away from the  Courts of First Instance of Manila the general jurisdiction over this action conferred  upon it by law.</p>
<p>And it will have been  observed that the  words "in the circuit court of the United  States," found in  the act of 1885, have in the act of  March 3, 1903,  been changed to "in the courts of the United States."  It is the claim of the appellant that the  courts  referred to are the circuit and  district courts only.  If it had been the intention of Congress to so limit the act,  it would have been more natural to have amended the phrase as found in  the act of 1885, by inserting the word "district" after the word "circuit."  Any doubt, however, which  might exist as to the meaning of this  term is  removed, we think, by the provisions of section 33 of said  act of March 3,  1903.   That section is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"That for the purposes  of this act the words 'the United States' as used in the title, as well  as in the various sections of this act, shall  be construed to mean the United States, and any waters, territory,  or other place now subject  to the jurisdiction thereof."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The insertion of this section in the law shows that Congress then had in mind Porto Rico, Hawaii, and the Philippines.   It  expressly  made the law applicable to those countries.  (Gonzales <em>vs</em>. Williams, 192 U.  S., 1, 16.)  It intended,  of  course, that the law  should  be enforced therein, and it must have intended that it would be enforced therein in the courts there established.  And when, in section 5, it changed the phrase "in the circuit court" to the phrase "in  the courts of the United States," and in section 33 declared that the words "United States" should include the Insular possessions, we think it used the phrase "in the courts of the United States" to indicate not only those courts in which is lodged  the judicial power  defined in the Constitution,  but also all courts which derive their authority from the United States.  To sustain the claim of the appellant that this case can be tried  in the circuit court of any district in the United States, if  the defendant can be found therein, would amount to a nonenforcement of the law as to all cases arising in the Philippines.  Applying the definition of section 33 to section 5, that section would read "as debts of like amount are recovered  in the courts of the United States, including the courts of Porto Rico, Hawaii, and the  Philippines."</p>
<p>The claim  of the appellant that inasmuch as he  would be entitled to a jury trial in the circuit court of the United States, he is entitled to a jury trial here, is met by what we have already said.  As the phrase "in the  courts  of the United States" includes the courts  in  the Philippines, it follows that a case brought in the Philippines must be tried as other civil actions are there tried.</p>
<p>Section 711 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, relied upon by the defendant, has nothing to do with the case, since that  refers to States.</p>
<p>The fact that at the time Act No. 136  was passed the right of action given by the act of March 3,  1903, did not exist,  is not important.  Courts of First  Instance  are courts of general jurisdiction, and every time a new right is created it is not necessary to expressly give  that court jurisdiction to enforce it.  (Lees <em>vs</em>. U.  S., 150 U. S., 476, 479.)</p>
<p>The contention of the defendant that this act, when it provided for a penalty, also provided  a  particular and exclusive remedy for enforcing it, can  not be maintained in view of the decision in the case of Lees <em>vs</em>. United States. The provisions of section 5 simply declare that the remedy should  be  such  as already existed  in   the  courts  of the United States.</p>
<p>The fact that there is no United States district attorney in the Philippine Islands might have prevented the United States from maintaining the action, bnt it can not prevent a citizen from so doing.  See, moreover, Act No. 1344 of the Commission.</p>
<p>We hold that the Courts of First  Instance of Manila have jurisdiction  of this suit,  and the judgment is accordingly affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant, and after the expiration of twenty days judgment should be  entered in accordance herewith  and  the case  remanded to the  court below for execution  thereof. So ordered.</p>
