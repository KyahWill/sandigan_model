				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On December 4, 1912, the municipal president of Antipolo, Province of Rizal, filed a written complaint in the justice of the peace court of the said pueblo, charging Leon Bandino with the crime&nbsp; of faithlessness in the custody of prisoners committed with reckless negligence.&nbsp; After making the proper investigation, the justice of the peace transmitted the record of the proceedings to the Court of First Instance. Thereafter the provincial fiscal, on July 30, 1913, filed an information wherein he charged the said Leon Bandino with the aforementioned crime, alleging that the accused, a municipal policeman&nbsp; having under his care and guard one Juan Lescano, who was serving a sentence in the "municipal jail of the said pueblo, did, with great carelessness and&nbsp; unjustified negligence, grant him permission to go and buy some cigarettes near the place where he was held in custody; that the prisoner, taking advantage of the confusion&nbsp; in the crowd there, fled from the custody of the accused; with violation of article 358 in connection with article 568 of the Penal Code.<br><br>A demurrer was filed to the complaint on the grounds that the facts therein alleged did not constitute a&nbsp; crime, but, on the&nbsp; contrary, proved the innocence&nbsp; of the accused. The court held that the prisoner's escape was&nbsp; not effected with the connivance of his custodian, so that the said crime could not exist, nor did that of escape accompanied by reckless imprudence.&nbsp; He consequently&nbsp; sustained&nbsp; the&nbsp; demurrer and ordered the prosecuting attorney&nbsp; to file a new complaint.<br><br>The provincial fiscal then reproduced&nbsp; the previous complaint, adding thereto the words "in tacit connivance with the said prisoner," that is, that the accused did, with exceeding carelessness and unjustified negligence, permit&nbsp; the prisoner to buy cigarettes outside of the jail.&nbsp; Counsel for the accused likewise demurred&nbsp; to this new complaint, on the ground that&nbsp; it was not&nbsp; drawn&nbsp; up in conformity with the legal&nbsp; provisions&nbsp; governing the&nbsp; crime charged and because the facts therein set forth did not constitute a cause of action, but completely exempted the accused from responsibility.<br><br>After trial of the case and consideration of the arguments of the provincial fiscal and&nbsp; the&nbsp; attorney for the accused, the court, by an order of the 19th of January of last year. sustained&nbsp; the demurrer filed&nbsp; by the defense&nbsp; and, in view of the fact that the provincial fiscal's statement that he could not further amend his complaint as&nbsp; he believed it to be sufficient&nbsp; as it was, the&nbsp; court finally dismissed the case, ordering the release of the accused and&nbsp; the cancellation oft the bail bond, with the&nbsp; costs <i>de officio</i>.&nbsp; The&nbsp; provincial fiscal excepted to this order and appealed therefrom.<br><br>Article&nbsp; 358 of the Penal Code prescribes that "any public officer guilty of connivance in the escape of a prisoner in his custody shall be punished," etc.<br><br>If there was connivance or consent on the part of the policeman, Leon&nbsp; Bandino, in Juan&nbsp; Lescano's leaving the jail, it is unquestionable that&nbsp; he is responsible for the crime&nbsp; with which he is charged on account of the escape effected by the said prisoner who took advantage of the leave allowed by his custodian on June 30, 1912.<br><br>In the existence and commission of the crime of faithlessness in the custody&nbsp; of prisoners, it is essential that there should have been, on the part of the custodian, connivance in the escape of the prisoner.&nbsp; If the public officer charged with guarding the fugitive did not connive with him, then he did not violate the law and is not guilty of the crime of faithlessness in the discharge of his duty to guard the prisoner.<br><br>The renowned juridical writer Escriche, in his dictionary "Legislacion y Jurisprudencia," defines the&nbsp; word "connivance" to be "dissimulation or tolerance,&nbsp; in the superior, of&nbsp; infractions or transgressions committed by&nbsp; his&nbsp; inferiors or subordinates against the institutions or laws under which they live."<br><br>It may perhaps be true that the accused had no knowledge that the prisoner Lescano would escape, and that he did not permit him to do so, but it is unquestionable that he did permit him to go out of the municipal jail, thus affording him an opportunity to get away with ease.&nbsp; Therefore the prisoner's escape was effected through the tolerance of his custodian, and is deemed also to have been by connivance with the latter.<br><br>According to the rules established by&nbsp; the courts,&nbsp; there is real and actual evasion&nbsp; of service of&nbsp; a sentence&nbsp; when the custodian,&nbsp; failing intentionally&nbsp; or maliciously to perform the duties of his office, and conniving with the prisoner,&nbsp; permits him to obtain a relaxation of his imprisonment and to escape the punishment of being deprived of his liberty, thus making the penalty ineffectual, although the convict "may not have fled, and where the prisoner's leaving the jail&nbsp; and his evasion of service of the sentence&nbsp; were effected&nbsp; with the consent and tolerance of the custodian, or rather in agreement and connivance with him.<br><br>Even though the accused committed the crime of faithlessness&nbsp; with&nbsp; carelessness, in violation of regulations or with culpable negligence, the case should&nbsp; not be dismissed nor should the crime go unpunished.<br><br>For the foregoing reasons the order appealed from is revoked and the record will be remanded to the court from whence it came in order that such proceedings be had as the law requires.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J., Johnson, Moreland,</i> and <i>Araullo, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br>CARSON, J., with whom concurs TRENT, J., concurring:<br><br>I concur with the disposing part of the decision.<br><br>I think it well to observe, nevertheless, that proof of the facts contained in the&nbsp; information&nbsp; will sustain merely a conviction of<span style="font-style: italic;"> infidelidad en la custodia de presos por imprudencia temeraria. </span></div>
