				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. DIONISIO SANTOS, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The sole facts of controlling force in the present case are these:
<p>Dionisio Santos, a policeman of Pateros, Province of Rizal, acting under the 
orders of his chief who desired to put a stop to pilfering in a certain 
locality, patrolled this district, and about midnight, seeing two persons in 
front of an uninhabited house and then entering an uninhabited <em>camarin</em>, 
arrested them without warrant, although no crime had been committed, and took 
them to the municipal <em>presidencia</em> where they were detained in the jail 
for six or seven hours when they were released. Was the accused guilty of 
coercion as found by the trial court? Or was he guilty of the lesser offense of 
arbitrary detention as suggested by the Attorney-General? Or was he innocent as 
argued by his counsel?</p>
<p>The powers of peace officers in the Philippines, generally stated, are the 
same as those conferred upon constables under the Anglo-American Common Law. The 
extent of their authority to make arrests without warrant and the limitations 
thereon, as held by the Supreme Court, are. as stated in the language of the 
Legislature in the Charter of the city of Manila. (U. S. <em>vs</em>. Fortaleza 
[1909], 12 Phil. Rep., 472.) The Administrative Code (sec. 2204, edition of 
1916; sec. 2258, edition of 1917) enjoins municipal policemen to "exercise 
vigilance in the prevention of public offenses."</p>
<p>The accused herein cannot justify the arrest by reason of acting in obedience 
to legal process which it was his duty to obey. He must justify, if at all, 
under the rule that peace officers may pursue and arrest without warrant any 
person found in suspicious places or under suspicious circumstances reasonably 
tending to show that such person has committed, or is about to commit any crime 
or. breach of the peace. Probable cause for an arrest without warrant is such a 
reasonable ground of suspicion supported by circumstances sufficiently strong in 
themselves as to warrant a reasonable man in believing the accused to be guilty. 
Besides reasonable ground of suspicion, action in good faith is another 
protective bulwark for the officer. Under such conditions, even if the suspected 
person is later found to be innocent, the peace officer is not liable.</p>
<p>One should however not expect too much of an ordinary policeman. He is not 
presumed to exercise the subtle reasoning of a judicial officer. Often he has no 
opportunity to make proper investigation but must act in haste on his own belief 
to prevent the escape of the criminal. To err is human. Even the most 
conscientious officer must at times be mislead. If, therefore, under trying 
circumstances and in a zealous effort to obey the orders of his superior officer 
and to enforce the law, a peace officer makes a mere mistake in good faith, he 
should be exculpated. Otherwise, the courts will put a premium on crime and will 
terrorize peace officers through a fear of themselves violating the law. (See 
generally Voorhees on Arrest; 5 Corpus Juris, pp. 399, 416; 2 R. C. L., p. 
450.)</p>
<p>The Common Law rule as to the arrest without warrant of suspicious 
night-walkers is of particular interest. Blackstone says, "Watchmen, either 
those appointed by the statute of Winchester (13 Edw. I, c. 4) to keep watch and 
ward in all towns from sun-setting to sun-rising, or such as are mere assistants 
to the constable, may <em>virtute officii</em> (by virtue of their office) 
arrest all offenders, and particularly night-walkers, and commit them to custody 
till the morning." (II Cooley's Blackstone, p. 1445.) The cases hold that a 
peace officer might arrest and detain in prison for examination persons walking 
in the street at night whom there is reasonable ground to suspect of felony, 
although there is no proof of a felony having been committed; but the arrest 
would be illegal if the person so arrested was innocent and there were no 
reasonable grounds of suspicion to mislead the officer. (Miles <em>vs</em>. 
Weston [1871], 60 111., 361, citing English decisions.) The reason of the rule 
is apparent. Good people do not ordinarily lurk about streets and uninhabited 
premises at midnight. Citizens must be protected from annoyance and crime. 
Prevention of crime is just as commendatory as the capture of criminals. Surely 
the officer must not be forced to await the commission of robbery or other 
felony. The rule is supported by the necessities of life.</p>
<p>The foregoing are the applicable principles of the American and English 
Common Law as to the powers of peace officers. The principles of the Spanish law 
are not essentially different. (<em>See</em> U. S. <em>vs</em>. Sanchez [1914], 
27 Phil. Rep., 442.) Both rest upon the same foundation of reason and common 
sense.</p>
<p>Judgment is reversed and the defendant and appellant acquitted, with the 
costs <em>de officio</em>. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Johnson, Carson, Araullo</em>, and <em>Street, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p></div>
