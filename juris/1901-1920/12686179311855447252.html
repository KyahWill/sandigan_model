				G.R. No. 1942, February 01, 1905</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE, VS. LOPE DEDICATORIA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MAPA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">It is a fact fully proven in this case that the defendant pretended
falsely to be an attorney at law and that his name was Jose Batallones,
in order to appear as a member of a family of this name with whom the
priest Don Juan de la Rosa had an intimate friendship; that by means of
these false pretenses defendant succeeded in living for some days in
said priest's house and gaining his confidence; later on, as a result
of that confidence thus gained by deceitful means, defendant succeeded
in getting the priest to loan him on several occasions various sums of
money, which he failed to repay; he also induced the priest to intrust
him with 60 pesos to be taken to the priest Juan Baliwag, and he failed
to comply with his trust. All the sums taken amount to 215 pesos.<p></p>
<p>These facts constitute the crime of <em>estafa</em> as provided for
and punished under subsections 1 and 5 of article 535 of the Penal
Code. The defendant should be punished with the penalty of <em>arresto</em> <em>mayor</em> in its medium degree to <em>presidio correccional</em>
in its minimum degree, because the amount embezzled is more than the
sum of 250 pesetas but less than 6,250 pesetas (subsec. 2, art. 534).
There are no extenuating circumstances to be considered in imposing the
penalty. The fact that the crime was committed at the house of the
injured party, which the court below considered as an aggravating
circumstance, should not be so considered, because that is an inherent
part of the crime, without which said crime could not have been
committed. Therefore, the defendant should suffer the penalty
prescribed by law in its medium degree, to wit, six months of <em>arresto mayor</em>.</p>
<p>We affirm the judgment below, it being understood that the penalty imposed on the defendant is six months of <em>arresto mayor</em>,with the costs in this instance. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson,</em> and <em>Carson, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
