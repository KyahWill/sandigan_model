				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. JUAN SOLIS, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This defendant was charged with the crime of embezzlement, of public funds as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"That the said Juan Solis on various dates between the 20th of September, 1004, and the 25th of February, 1905, in the;  municipality of Zamboanga, Moro Province, Philippine  Islands, being a public functionary employed in the office of the municipal treasurer of said municipality, appropriated to his own use public funds which were under his charge, amounting to 1,075 pesetas."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After a consideration of the proof  adduced during the trial of said cause, the lower court found the defendant guilty of said crime, sentenced him to be imprisoned for a period  of  throe years six months and twenty-one days of prvshlio corrccciomil, and to return to the municipality of Zamboanga the  sum of 1,075  pesetas and, in case of insolvency, to suffer subsidiary  imprisonment,  with the accessory penalties provided  for in article 58 of the Penal Tode, and  to pay the  costs.   From this decision  the defendant appealed to  this court,</p>
<p>From an examination of the record brought to this court we find (he following facts:</p>
<p>First. That the  defendant,  Juan  Solis, was duly appointed as an employee in the office of  the municipal treasurer of the municipality  of Zamboanga  on  the  20th  of September, l904;</p>
<p>Second. That his duties as such employee were to brand cattle and to register such brands in the proper registry; Third. That while acting as such employee he received P1. each from 215 different persons for the alleged purpose of branding and registering their cattle;</p>
<p>Fourth. That these P215 so received Avere not delivered to the  municipal treasurer of such municipality but wrere retained by the defendant and appropriated  to his own use;</p>
<p>Fifth. That in the performance of the duties  imposed upon the defendant by the municipal treasurer under his appointment he had no authority to receive said  sums of money.</p>
<p>The lower court found the defendant guilty and sentenced him for violating paragraph 2 of article 390 of the Penal Code upon the theory that the defendant was: First, a public official; and second, had received public funds by reason of his duties as such public official.</p>
<p>Under the facts in this case the defendant was  a public official  (U. S. vs. Sarmiento, 1 Phil. Rep.,  484), but as such public official he had no authority to receive public funds; therefore he can not be convicted under article 390 of the Penal Code and the decision of the lower court must therefore be reversed.</p>
<p>The evidence clearly shows, however, that the defendant while in the employment  of the municipal treasurer did receive P215 which belonged to the  said municipal treasurer as  such.  Paragraph  5  of article 535 of the Penal Code provides that the punishment  provided  for in article 534 shall be imposed upon those who "to the prejudice of another shall appropriate or misapply any money, goods, or any kind of personal property which they may  have received as a deposit on commission for administration or in any other character producing the obligation to deliver or return the same, or who shall deny having  received it."</p>
<p>The question arises, Can a person who is charged  with the crime of <em>malversaicion de caudales publicos</em> be convicted of the crime of <em>estafa</em> upon the same complaint?  The crime of <em>malversacion</em>, or embezzlement, as denned by the Penal Code can only be committed by a public official who has charge  by virtue of his official position  of public funds. Even though he be a public official and is not responsible for public funds, or has no authority to receive the same, he can not be convicted of the offense of <em>malversacion</em>.  If, however, while acting as a public official, he  receives money without  authority which belongs to  another  and appropriates the same to his own use and fails  and refuses to deliver the same to the person to whom it properly belongs, he has committed the same  acts which  would make him liable under the Penal Code for  the crime of <em>malversacion</em> had he authority as a public  official to receive such funds. We are of the opinion and so hold that he has violated by these acts the  provisions of  the Penal Code providing a punishment for the crime of <em>estafa</em> and is therefore guilty of the crime of <em>estafa</em> and is punishable under the provisions of the Penal Code.   <em>Estafa</em>, when  committed under the above conditions,  is a similar or cognate offense to that of malv&amp;rsaddnp,  or  embezzlement,  under the Penal Code; therefore  the  person  charged  with  the i crime of <em>malversacion</em>, or  embezzlement,  may  be  convicted of the crime of <em>estafa</em> under the same complaint.</p>
<p>This court has already held, in  the case of U. S. vs. Nery<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> (3  Off. Gaz., 82), that "when a person is  charged in a complaint with a crime and the evidence does not show that he is guilty of the crime charged, but does show that he is guilty of some  other lesser offense, the court may sentence him  for the  lesser  offense,  provided  the lesser offense is a similar or cognate offense and is included in the complaint."  This conclusion is also supported by the decisions of the supreme court of Spain.  (See judgment of the 21st of February, 1889, 6th Viada, p. 292.) Paragraph 2 of article 534 of  the said Penal Code provides that those  committing the acts in said paragraph above quoted shall be punished with <em>arresto mayor </em>in its medium degree to <em>presidio correccional</em> in  its minimum degree if  the defraudation shall exceed  250 pesetas and not be more than 6,250 pesetas.  The amount received by the defendant herein was 215 pesos or 1,075 pesetas.  There were neither aggravating nor mitigating circumstances attending the commission of the crime, therefore the defendant .must be punished in the medium degree in accordance with the provisions of article 81, in its  relation with article 82 of the said code.  The medium degree of arresto mayor in its medium degree to presidio correctional in its minimum degree is four months and one day to six months.</p>
<p>Article 399 of the Penal  Code provides that the public official who, taking advantage of his official position, shall commit any of the crimes specified in chapter 4, section 2, title 13 of the Penal Code, shall incur, in addition to the penalties prescribed therein, that  of  temporary  special disqualification in its maximum degree to perpetual special disqualification.</p>
<p>It is the judgment of this court that the said defendant shall be imprisoned for a period of five months of arresto mayor and shall incur eleven years and  one day of temporary special disqualification.</p>
<p>After the expiration  of ten days  let judgment be entered in accordance  herewith and ten days  thereafter the case be remanded to the lower court for execution. So ordered.</p>
