				<H3>ANICETO LORENZO, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. JOSI NAVARRO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.

				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The principal question in this case is one of fact.   The defendant was in possession  of  two  fisheries.   Plaintiff claimed  that he was occupying them  as his  (plaintiff's) tenant, by virtue of a contract of lease made between the defendant and  the father of the plaintiff, Cornelio Lorenzo, in 1894.  The  defendant's claim is that at that time Cornelio Lorenzo was a tenant of an estate of which the parish priest was the administrator;  that the tenant  was in arrears in regard to the rent; that a  contract was then made between  him, Cornelio  Lorenzo, and the defendant, by the terms of which the defendant agreed to pay to the administrator  the  rent then  due, and to pay  Cornelio Lorenzo the value of his improvements; that he made both of these payments, and  in consideration thereof Cornelio Lorenzo transferred to frim all his interest in the fisheries. In support of  this claim the  defendant produced a document signed by the  parish  priest as administrator as aforesaid, and by Cornelio Lorenzo, which proved this contention.   The judge rejected this evidence upon the, ground that the fisheries named in the document were not identified as the fisheries in question in this suit.   An examination of the evidence in the case, however, shows not only that the defendant testified that they were  the same fisheries  but also that the plaintiff himself testified that the only fisheries in which his father was ever interested were the ones occupied by the defendant, and to which this suit relates.</p>
<p>There having been  a motion for a new trial, we are required to consider the whole evidence, and  to  render such judgment  thereon as is just.   (Sec. 497, Code of Civil Procedure, Benedicto <em>vs</em>. de la Rama,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 2  Off. Gaz., 166.)</p>
<p>The appellant in his  brief presents a question as to the admissibility of certain evidence under the pleadings.   The defendant's answer was a general denial of all the  allegations of the complaint.   Under this general denial he was entitled to prove any facts which tended directly to show that the contract between himself and the father  of the plaintiff was not one of lease, but was for example, one of sale.  He was not required to allege these facts  in his answer as a special defense.</p>
<p>The  evidence  strongly preponderates  in favor  of the judgment rendered for  the defendant by the court  below, and it  is accordingly affirmed, with the costs  of this instance against the appellant, and after the expiration of twenty days  judgment should  be entered in accordance herewith and the  case  remanded to the court  below for execution.  So ordered.</p>
<em>Arellano, C. J., Mapa, Johnson,</em> and <em>Carson, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
