				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an action brought to recover damages for injuries sustained in an 
accident which occurred in Caloocan on the night of August 8, 1909.
<p>The defendant is a corporation engaged in operating an electric street 
railway in the city of Manila and its suburbs, including the municipality of 
Caloocan. The plaintiff's residence in Caloocan fronts on the street along which 
defendant's tracks run, so that to enter his premises from the street plaintiff 
is obliged to cross defendant's tracks. On the night mentioned plaintiff drove 
home in a calesa and in crossing the tracks to enter his premises the horse 
stumbled, leaped forward, and fell, causing the vehicle to strike one of the 
rails with great force. The fall of the horse and the collision of the vehicle 
with the rails, resulting in a sudden stop, threw plaintiff from the vehicle and 
caused the injuries complained of.</p>
<p>It is undisputed that at the point where plaintiff crossed the tracks on the 
night in question not only the rails were above-ground, but that the ties upon 
which the rails rested projected from one-third to one-half of their depth out 
of the ground, thus making the tops of the rails some 5 or 6 inches or more 
above the level of the street.</p>
<p>It is admitted that the defendant was negligent in maintaining its tracks as 
described, but it is contended that the plaintiff was also negligent in that he 
was intoxicated to such an extent at the time of the accident that he was unable 
to take care of himself properly and that such intoxication was the primary 
cause of the accident.</p>
<p>The trial court held that both parties were negligent, but that the 
plaintiff's negligence was not as great as defendant's and under the authority 
of the case of Rakes <em>vs.</em> A. G. &amp; P. Co. (7 Phil. Rep., 359) 
apportioned the damages and awarded plaintiff a judgment of P1,000.</p>
<p>The question before us is stated by the defendant thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Accepting the findings of the trial court that both plaintiff and defendant 
were guilty of negligence, the only question to be considered is whether the 
negligence of plaintiff contributed to the 'principal occurrence' or 'only to 
his own injury.' If the former, he cannot recover; if the latter, the trial 
court was correct in apportioning the damages."</p></blockquote>
<p>The question as stated by plaintiff is as follows: "The main question at 
issue is whether or not the plaintiff was negligent, and, if so, to what extent. 
If the negligence of the plaintiff was the primary cause of the accident then, 
of course, he cannot recover; if his negligence had nothing to do with the 
accident but contributed to his injury, then the court was right in apportioning 
the damages, but if there was no negligence on the part of the plaintiff, then 
he should be awarded damages adequate to the injury sustained."</p>
<p>In support of the defendant's contention counsel says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Defendant's negligence was it,s failure properly to maintain the track; 
plaintiff's negligence was his intoxication; the 'principal occurrence' was 
plaintiff's fall from his calesa. It seems clear, that plaintiff's intoxication 
contributed to the fall; if he had been sober, it can hardly be doubted that he 
would have crossed the track safely, as he had done a hundred times 
before."</p></blockquote>
<p>While both parties appealed from the decision, the defendant on the ground 
that it was not liable and the plaintiff on the ground that the damages were 
insufficient according to the evidence, and while the plaintiff made a motion 
for a new trial upon the statutory grounds and took proper exception to the 
denial thereof, thus conferring upon this court jurisdiction to determine the 
questions of fact, nevertheless, not all of the testimony taken on the trial, so 
far as can be gathered from the record, has been brought to this court. There 
seem to have been two hearings, one on the 31st of August and the other on the 
28th of September. The evidence taken on the first hearing is here; that taken 
on the second is not. Not all the evidence taken on the hearings being before 
the court, we must refuse, under our rules, to consider even that evidence which 
is here; and, in the decision of this case, we are, therefore, relegated to the 
facts stated in the opinion of the court and the pleadings filed.</p>
<p>A careful reading of the decision of the trial court leads us to the 
conclusion that there is nothing in the opinion which sustains the conclusion of 
the court that the plaintiff was negligent with reference to the accident which 
is the basis of this action. Mere intoxication is not negligence, nor does the 
niere fact of intoxication establish a want of ordinary care. It is but a 
circumstance to be corfsiclered with the other evidence tending to prove 
negligence. It is the general rule that it is immaterial whether a man is drunk 
or sober if no want of ordinary care or prudence can be imputed to him, and no 
greater degree of care is required to be exercised by an intoxicated man for his 
own protection than by a sober one. If one's conduct is characterized by a 
proper degree of care and prudence, it is immaterial whether he is drunk or 
sober. (Ward <em>vs.</em> Chicago etc., R. R. Co., 85 Wis., 601; H. &amp; T. C. 
R. Co. <em>vs.</em> Reason, 61 Tex., 613; Alger <em>vs.</em> Lowell, 3 Allen, 
Mass., 402; Central R. R. Co. <em>vs.</em> Phinazee, 93 Ga., 488; Maguire 
<em>vs.</em> Middlesex R. R. Co., 115 Mass., 239; Meyer <em>vs.</em> Pacific R. 
R. Co., 40 Mo., 151; Chicago &amp; N. W. R. R. Co. <em>vs.</em> Drake, 33 Ill. 
App., 114.)</p>
<p>If intoxication is not in itself negligence, what are the facts found by the 
trial court and stated in its opinion upon which may be predicated the finding 
that the plaintiff did not use ordinary care and prudence and that the 
intoxication contributed to the injury complained of? After showing clearly and 
forcibly the negligence of the defendant in leaving its tracks in the condition 
in which they were on the night of the injury, the court has the following to 
say, and it is all that can be found in its opinion, with reference to the 
negligence of the plaintiff: "With respect to the condition in which Mr. Wright 
was on returning to his house on the night in question, the testimony of Doctor 
Kneedler, who was the physician who attended him an hour after the accident, 
demonstrates that he was intoxicated. * * *</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If the defendant or its employees were negligent by reason of having left 
the rails and a part of the ties uncovered in a street where there is a large 
amount of travel, the plaintiff was no less negligent, he not having abstained 
from his custom of taking more wine than he could carry without disturbing his 
judgment and his self-control, he knowing that he had to drive a horse and wagon 
and to cross railroad tracks which were to a certain extent dangerous by reason 
of the rails being elevated above the level of the street.</p>
<p>"If the plaintiff had been prudent on the night in question and had not 
attempted to drive his conveyance while in a drunken condition, he would 
certainly have avoided the damages which he received, although the company, on 
its part, was negligent in maintaining its tracks in a bad condition for 
travel.</p>
<p>"Both parties, therefore, were negligent and both contributed to the damages 
resulting to the plaintiff, although the plaintiff, in the judgment of the 
court, contributed in greater proportion to.the damages than did the 
defendant."</p></blockquote>
<p>As is clear from reading the opinion, no facts are stated therein which 
warrant the conclusion ttiat the plaintiff was negligent. The conclusion that if 
he had been sober he would not have been injured is not warranted by the facts 
as found. It is impossible to say that a sober man would not have fallen from 
the vehicle under the conditions described. A horse crossing the railroad tracks 
with not only the rails but a portion of the ties themselves aboveground, 
stumbling by reason of the unsure footing and falling, the vehicle crashing 
against the rails with such force as to break a wheel, this might be sufficient 
to throw a person from the vehicle no matter what his condition; and to conclude 
that, under such circumstances, a sober man would not have fallen while a 
drunken man did, is to draw a conclusion which enters the realm of speculation 
and guess work.</p>
<p>It having been found that the plaintiff was not negligent, it is unnecessary 
to discuss the question presented by the appellant company with reference to the 
applicability of the case of Rakes vsi A. G. &amp; P. Co., above; and we do not 
find facts in the opinion of the court below which justify a larger verdict than 
the one found.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, without special finding as to 
costs.</p>

<p><strong>CARSON, J.</strong></p>
<p>I dissent. I think, in the first place, that before pronouncing judgment the 
parties should have an.opportunity, if they so desire, to correct the manifestly 
accidental omission from the record of a part of the transcript of the record. 
It is very clear that when the case was submitted, and the briefs filed, both 
parties were under the mistaken impression that all the evidence was in the 
record.</p>
<p>I think, furthermore, that if the case is to be decided on the findings of 
fact by the trial judge, these findings sufficiently establish the negligence of 
the plaintiff.</p>
<p>The trial judge expressly found that—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If the plaintiff had been prudent on the night in question and had not 
attempted to drive his conveyance while in a drunken condition, he would 
certainly have avoided the damages which he received, although the company, on 
its, part, was negligent in maintaining its tracks in a bad condition for 
travel."</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a finding of fact—the-fact of negligence—and I know of no rule which 
requires the trial court to set forth not only the ultimate facts found by it, 
but also all the evidentiary facts on which such conclusions are based The 
finding is not in conflict with the other facts found by the trial judge, and 
though it is not fully sustained thereby, we must assume, if we decline to 
examine the record, that there were evidentiary facts disclosed at the trial 
which were sufficient to sustain the finding of negligence. "The statement of 
facts must contain only those facts which are essential to a clear understanding 
of the issues presented and the facts involved." (Act No. 190, sec. 133.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The facts required to be found are the ultimate facts forming the issues 
presented by the pleadings, and which constitute the foundation for a judgment, 
and not those that are merely evidentiary of them. The court is not required to 
find merely evidentiary facts, or to set forth and explain the means or 
processes by which he arrived at such findings. Neither evidence, argument, nor 
comment has any legitimate place in findings of facts." (Conlan vs. Grace, 36 
Minn., 276,282.)<br></p></blockquote></div>
