				<BR><STRONG>FISHER, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Judgment in this case was rendered for plaintiff in the trial court, April 
29,1916. Defendants were notified of the decision May 13, 1916, and on that date 
gave written notice of their exception and of their motion for a new trial. May 
24, 1916, the motion for a new trial was denied and on June 2, 1916, defendants 
gave notice in writing of their exception to the ruling and of their intention 
to file a bill of exceptions. No bill of exceptions was filed until July 12, 
1916. Plaintiff gave notice in writing of his objection to the allowance of the 
bill of exceptions upon the ground that the time for its allowance had expired. 
Thereupon defendants, on July 15, 1916, made application in writing to the trial 
court for an extension of the time for the presentation of the bill of 
exceptions until July 17, 1916. This application was supported by the affidavit 
of A. S. Crossfield, one of the attorneys for defendants, in which it is stated 
that the reason for the failure to file the bill of exceptions within the term 
of ten days prescribed by section 143 of the Code of Civil Procedure is that 
counsel was occupied with other matters and that he forgot to prepare and file 
the bill of exceptions within the time allowed by the statute. The granting of 
the extension requested was opposed by plaintiff, but the court below, by a 
<em>nunc pro tunc</em> order dated July 26, 1916, undertook to extend the time 
for the filing of the bill of exceptions to July 17, 1916.<p></p>
<p>In this court the plaintiff, in his brief as appellee, renews his objection 
to the allowance of the bill of exceptions and contends that the appeal should 
be dismissed upon the ground that it was not taken within the time allowed by 
law.</p>
<p>Section 143 of Act No. 190 provides that "* * * the party desiring to 
prosecute the bill of exceptions shall so inform the court at the time of the 
rendition of final judgment, or as soon thereafter as may be practicable and 
before the ending of the term of court at which final judgment is rendered, and 
the judge shall enter a memorandum to that effect upon his minutes and order a 
like memorandum to be made by the clerk upon the docket of the court among the 
other entries relating to the action. <em>Within ten days after the entry of the 
memorandum aforesaid, the excepting party shall cause to be presented to the 
judge</em> * * *" his bill of exceptions. As the notice of intention to 
prosecute the bill of exceptions in this case was given on June 2, 1916, while 
the bill of exceptions was not in fact presented until July 12th following, the 
question arises whether the judgment of the trial court was still appealable 
when the bill of exceptions was presented and the order of enlargement was 
made.</p>
<p>In the case of Director of Lands vs. Maurera and Tiongson (p. 410, 
<em>ante</em>), this court held in passing upon a motion to dismiss the bill of 
exceptions in a case tried under the Land Registration Act, that although the 
statute therein under consideration fixes the term of thirty days from the date 
upon which the party receives a copy of the decision as the period within which 
the bill of exceptions must be filed, nevertheless if an application is 
presented to the trial judge for the enlargement of the statutory term 
<em>within</em> the thirty days limited by the statute, it may be extended. On 
the other hand, in the case of Bermudez <em>vs</em>. Director of Lands (36 Phil. 
Rep., 774) in which the application for an enlargement was made after the 
expiration of the thirty days, the court disapproved the practice. Referring to 
this decision in the .Maurera case the court said: "In the first case there is 
no time to be extended—the time has already expired; in the second case * * * 
there is time which may be extended. In such a case we are of the opinion, and 
so decide, that it is within the sound discretion of the court to extend the 
period of thirty days for the presentation of a bill of exceptions in a land 
registration case."</p>
<p>The court having expressly decided in the Bermudez case, <em>supra</em>, that 
the term of thirty days fixed for the presentation of a bill of exceptions in 
land registration cases cannot be enlarged by the court when the application for 
enlargement is made after the expiration of the time limited by law, the 
question arises if such an enlargement can be granted upon an application for 
enlargement made <em>after</em> the expiration of the term of ten days 
prescribed by section 143 of Act No. 190 for a like purpose in ordinary 
actions.</p>
<p>Before entering upon an examination of the earlier decisions of the court, in 
which this matter has been considered, it may be profitable to make some inquiry 
into this matter of the jurisdiction which the law confers upon this court to 
pass upon the correctness of the decisions of the Courts of First Instance.</p>
<p>The appellate jurisdiction of this court is conferred upon it by section 18 
of Act No. 136, which reads as follows:</p>
<p>"The Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction of all actions and 
special proceedings <em>properly brought to it</em> from Courts of First 
Instance * * *."</p>
<p>It will not be disputed that the judgment of a Court of First Instance in a 
matter falling within its jurisdiction and in which its proceedings are not 
vitiated by fraud, cannot, subject to the exception created by section 113 of 
Act No. 190, be reopened by any judicial authority after it has become final. 
The court by which it has been rendered is powerless to reopen the matter. "* * 
* Courts have no power thus to vacate judgments after they have become final in 
the sense that the party in whose favor they are rendered is entitled <em>as of 
right</em> to have execution thereon * * * (Arnedo <em>vs</em>. Llorente and 
Liongson, 18 Phil. Rep., 257, 269.) When the judgment of the lower court has 
become final in the sense that the successful party is entitled as of right to 
have execution thereon this court is equally powerless to entertain an appeal 
from such a judgment. The question is one of <em>jurisdiction</em>. This court 
has no jurisdiction to entertain appeals in matters which are no longer <em>sub 
judice</em>. Whether the decision of the trial court is right or wrong the 
matter is <em>res judicata</em> and the rights of the parties have become fixed 
and determined.</p>
<p>This is the settled doctrine of the Supreme Court of the United States. In 
the case of Credit Co. <em>vs</em>. Arkansas Central R. Co. (128 U. S., 258), 
the appeal was allowed by Justice Miller on the last day on which an appeal 
could be taken, but was not presented to the court below nor filed with the 
clerk until five days after the prescribed time had expired. It was held that 
the appeal must be dismissed. the court saying:</p>
<p>"The attempt made in this case to anticipate the actual time of presenting 
and filing the appeal, by entering an order mine pro tune does not help the 
case. When the time for taking an appeal has expired <em>it cannot be arrested 
or called back by a simple order of the court</em>. If it could be, the law 
which limits the time within which an appeal can be taken would be a dead 
letter.</p>
<p>"The appeal must be dismissed * * *."</p>
<p>The rule announced in this case was expressly approved and applied by the 
Supreme Court of the United States in the recent case of the Old Nick Williams 
Co. <em>vs</em>. U. S. (215 U. S., 541), decided January 24, 1910.</p>
<p>In the case of Scarborough <em>vs</em>. Pargoud (108 U. S., 567), in which an 
attempt was made to have the court entertain an appeal after the expiration of 
the time allowed by the statute within which an appeal might be taken, the court 
said:</p>
<p>* * * The writ of error in this case was not brought within the time limited 
by law and we have consequently <em>no jurisdiction</em>. For that reason the 
writ is dismissed."</p>
<p>Section 47 of General Orders No, 58 provides that—</p>
<p>"An appeal must be taken within fifteen days from the rendition of the 
judgment or order appealed from." </p>
<p>In the case of The United States <em>vs</em>. Trincio (4 Phil. Rep., 90), 
this court held, following the decision announced in the case of The United 
States <em>vs</em>. Flemister (1 Phil. Rep., 317), that appeals in criminal 
cases can not be taken after the lapse of fifteen days from the rendition of the 
judgment or order appealed from and that the pendency of a motion for a new 
trial does not extend the time within which the appeal may be perfected. This 
rule was reconsidered and affirmed after an extended review of the authorities 
in the recent case of The United States <em>vs</em>. the Court of First Instance 
of Manila (24 Phil. Rep., 321).</p>
<p>It having been decided that the term fixed by General Orders No. 58 within 
which appeals may be taken in criminal cases is nonextendable and that the term 
of thirty days allowed for filing bill of exceptions in land registration cases 
cannot be extended unless an application for such extension is made 
<em>before</em> its expiration, the question presents itself whether there is 
any reason why a different rule should be followed with regard to the time 
allowed within which to file the bill of exceptions in an ordinary civil action. 
It is to be noted that the language of section 143 of Act No. 190, by the use of 
the word "shall," is fully as imperative in its declaration regarding the time 
within which the bill of exceptions may be filed in such an action as are the 
statutes upon which were based the decisions of this court regarding appeals in 
land registration and criminal cases.</p>
<p>It is a fact, however, that in the case of Gomez Garcia <em>vs</em>. Hipolito 
(2 Phil. Rep., 732), it was expressly held, two justices dissenting, that the 
period of ten days prescribed by section 143 of Act No. 190 may be extended by 
the trial court, expressly or tacitly, either before or after its expiration. In 
several cases since decided the same rule, with more or less variation, has been 
announced. In the case of Gonzalez Quiros vs. Palanca Tan-Guinlay (17 Phil. 
Rep., 357, 368), however, the Court, after citing section 143 of Act No. 190, 
dismissed the bill of exceptions upon the express ground that "the record does 
not show that the judgment creditor * * * presented the necessary bill of 
exceptions within the ten days specified by law for its admission and 
prosecution, * * *</p>
<p>We shall not attempt, however, to collate the many decisions in which this 
vexatious question has been considered, or attempt to reconcile them. It must be 
admitted that the decision in the Gomez Garcia case has opened the door to 
endless doubt and hesitation. If the term of ten days fixed by the statute may 
be disregarded, and extensions granted <em>nunc pro tunc</em> upon applications 
presented after its expiration, it is evident that there is no other guide or 
landmark to make known the point at which a litigated matter passes into the 
domain of things adjudicated. In criminal cases (U. S. vs. Flemister, 1 Phil. 
Rep., 317); in land registration cases (Bermudez <em>vs</em>. Director of Lands, 
36 Phil. Rep., 774) ; in special proceedings (Alemany vs. Sweeney, 3 Phil. Rep., 
424); in cases coming before the Board of Public Utility Commissioners 
(Philippine Shipowners' Association <em>vs</em>. Public Utility Commissioners, 
R. G. No. 13443, decided January 21, 1918),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> there is a fixed and definite limit of 
time after the expiration of which no further dispute is possible as to the 
finality of the decision, if free from fraud or jurisdictional defects. The 
advantages of such certainty to parties and to the courts are plainly manifest. 
The disadvantages of the uncertainty now prevailing with regard to the time 
within which appeals may be taken in ordinary actions are equally obvious. Since 
the decision in the case of Gomez Garcia <em>vs</em>. Hipolito (<em>supra</em>) 
broke down the definite boundary prescribed by the statute, this court has 
devoted months of its time to a consideration of the conduct of parties and 
counsel in a multitude of cases for the purpose of determining whether the 
excuses offered for failure to comply with the terms of the law should be 
accepted or not. Equally prolific of loss of time and fruitless discussion has 
been the debate over the meaning of the term "as soon thereafter as may be 
practicable" contained in section 143 of Act No. 190 as prescribing the time 
within which notice of intention to prosecute the bill of exceptions must be 
given after the receipt of notice of the rendition of a judgment. In the case of 
Santillan <em>vs</em>. Almonte (24 Phil. Rep., 227) the Court has endeavored to 
remedy the defect by adopting the rule that save in exceptional cases not more 
than twenty days after the receipt of notice of entry of judgment will be 
allowed within which to give notice of intention to present a bill of 
exceptions, thus fixing a definite limit to a period which the statute vaguely 
outlines by requiring that the notice be given "as soon * * * as practicable." 
This having been done, were it not for the doubt and uncertainty introduced by 
the Gomez Garcia case, it would be possible to determine, with a reasonable 
degree of precision, the end of litigation by enforcing the rule of the statute 
that the bill of exceptions in such actions shall be filed within ten days after 
the date upon which notice of intention to present it is given or within such 
additional time as may be allowed by the court for that purpose by order made 
upon petition filed <em>before</em> the expiration of the said term of ten days. 
Under such a practice the successful party would know positively when he is 
entitled to a writ of execution <em>as of right</em> and the clerks of the lower 
courts would have equally reliable means of determining when the ministerial 
duty of issuing such writs devolves upon them. The Courts of First Instance 
would know positively when their power to reopen their judgment comes to an end. 
The court has said in the case of Arnedo <em>vs</em>. Llorente and Liongson (18 
Phil. Rep., 257, 269) that their power ends when the successful party is 
entitled to a writ of execution <em>as of right</em>. But this can only be when 
the litigation is <em>ended</em>, when it has passed out of the control of the 
judiciary, and unless that time can be determined positively by a simple 
mathematical computation—as it can be in criminal cases, in land registration 
cases, and in special proceedings—trouble will constantly arise. It is an 
unfortunate fact that the result of the decision in the Gomez Garcia case has 
been to give rise to a great deal of doubt and uncertainty. We believe that it 
is incumbent upon us to put an end to this uncertainty by expressly disapproving 
the doctrine of the Gomez Garcia case, and others in which it has been followed, 
and by declaring our purpose to adhere to the express terms of section 143 of 
Act No. 190 by refusing to entertain appeals in all cases in which the appellant 
has failed to file his bill of exceptions within ten days from the time of 
giving notice of his intention to do so or within such additional time as the 
trial court may by express order have allowed in response to a petition for 
enlargement filed <em>before</em> the expiration of the statutory period of ten 
days.</p>
<p>The bill of exceptions in this case having been filed over a month after the 
date upon which notice of intention to present it was filed and no application 
for an enlargement of the statutory period having been made <em>before</em> its 
expiration, we are without jurisdiction to entertain the appeal and the bill of 
exceptions is therefore dismissed. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson, Araullo, Street</em>, and <em>Avanceña, 
JJ.</em>, concur.</p>

<p align="center"><em><strong>CONCURRING OPINION</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>MALCOLM, J.</strong>, <em>concurring:</em></p>
<p>I agree. Only I would go further. I would stay with the law.</p>
<p>When the Code of Criminal Procedure fixes the period of fifteen days within 
which an appeal can be taken, the law means what it says. This court has so 
held. When the Land Registration Law fixes the period of thirty days within 
which appeals and bills of exception must be filed, the law means what it says. 
This court has so held. When the Code of Civil Procedure fixes the period of ten 
days within which a bill of exceptions can be presented, the law means what it 
says. This court has not so held. When any procedural statute names a definite 
period within which an act must be performed, no inherent right in a court is 
resurrected and the legislative intention of certainty and finality in judicial 
proceedings is" plainly apparent. The time for appeal fixed by statute is not 
extendible by a court, whether application is made before or after its 
expiration.</p>
<p>As I said in the dissenting opinion in Director of Lands <em>vs</em>. Maurera 
and Tiongson (p. 410, <em>ante</em>), in speaking of section 26 of Act No. 2347, 
concerning the time within which the litigating parties must file their appeals 
and bills of exception against the final judgments in land registration 
cases:</p>
<p>"* * * No words could be plainer. Application is wisdom. Interpretation is 
dangerous. Judicial amendment is fatal. Only note that to emphazise intention, 
the Legislature uses such emphatic words as "must" and "shall." Of course, the 
law was drafted and passed for a purpose. The laudible intention of the 
Legislature was to expedite court proceedings. A court should not make this law 
a dead letter. Our only duty is to give effect to legislative intention.</p>
<p>"In view, therefore, of the easily understandable provisions of the law which 
gave no discretion to the courts, I must by this dissent protest against our 
usurpation of legislative power tending to the prolongation of judicial 
proceedings."</p></div>
