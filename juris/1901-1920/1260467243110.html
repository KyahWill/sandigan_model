				G.R. No. 878, January 02, 1903</h4>
				<H3>EVARISTO ALVAREZ, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. LEON MONTINOLA ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C. J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> On  the 25th  of October, 1898, one of the defendants, Rufino Diamanan, by a private document sold to the plaintiff, Evaristo Alvarez, forty head of carabaos for  the sum of $2,500, which  amount was duly paid by the latter to the former,  as  appears  from  the instrument of  sale  itself. The purchaser  agreed to  reconvey the carabaos to  the vendor at any time within three years from the date of sale on the repayment of the purchase priceâ€”the sale to  be absolute and the seller to execute the proper <em>credenciales</em> of transfer in case Diamanan failed to  make repayment to Alvarez  within the time limited, to wit, on or before October 25, 1901.</p>
<p> From the time of the sale so made until the 21st of December, 1900, the property conveyed continued in the possession of the plaintiff.</p>
<p> On the 21st of December, 1900, Leon Montinola,  in an executive action prosecuted by him against Rufino Diamanan to recover certain  sums of money alleged  to be due to him,  the said Montinola embargoed 23 head of these carabaos as the  property  of his debtor Diamanan.</p>
<p> On the 12th of January, 1901,  Alvarez commenced the present proceeding of intervention under claim of ownership, alleging that he and not Rufino Diamanan was the owner of the embargoed animals, and demanded that the embargo laid thereon be raised and the property returned to him as the rightful  owner thereof.</p>
<p> The court below adjudged that plaintiff's intervention as the owner of the property embargoed in the executive action  prosecuted by Montinola against  Diamanan was well  founded,  and raised the embargo.   Montinola appealed.</p>
<p> An examination of the record  not having disclosed any error of fact or law the judgment is affirmed, each party to pay his own costs.   So ordered.</p>
<p> <em> Torres, Cooper, Willard, Mapa,</em> and <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
