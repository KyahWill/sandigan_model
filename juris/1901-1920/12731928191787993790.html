				<BR><STRONG>STREET, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In March, 1914, the steamship <em>Alicante</em>, belonging to the 
<em>Compañia Trasatlantica de Barcelona</em>, arrived at Manila with two 
locomotive boilers aboard, the property of The Manila Railroad Company. The 
equipment of the ship for discharging heavy cargo was not sufficiently strong to 
handle these boilers, and it was therefore necessary for the Steamship Company 
to procure assistance in the port of Manila.
<p>The Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific Company (hereafter called the Atlantic 
Company) was accordingly employed by the Steamship Company, as having probably 
the best equipment for this purpose of any contracting company in the city. The 
service to be performed by the Atlantic Company consisted in bringing its 
floating crane alongside the <em>Alicante</em>, lifting the boilers out of the 
ship's hold, and transferring them to a barge which would be placed ready to 
receive them.</p>
<p>Upon the arrival of the <em>Alicante</em>, the Atlantic Company sent out its 
crane in charge of one Leyden. In preparing to hoist the first boiler the sling 
was unfortunately adjusted near the middle of the boiler, and it was thus raised 
nearly in an horizontal position. The boiler was too long to clear the hatch in 
this position, and after one end of the boiler had emerged on one side of the 
hatch, the other still remained below on the other side. When the boiler had 
been gotten into this position and was being hoisted still further, a rivet near 
the head of the boiler was caught under the edge of the hatch. The weight on the 
crane was thus increased by a strain estimated at fifteen tons with the result 
that the cable of the sling parted and the boiler fell to the bottom of the 
ship's hold. The sling was again id justed to the boiler but instead of being 
placed near the niddle it was now slung nearer one of the ends, as should lave 
been done at first. The boiler was again lifted; but is it was being brought up, 
the bolt at the end of the lerrick boom broke, and again the boiler fell.</p>
<p>The crane was repaired and the boiler discharged, but t was found to be so 
badly damaged that it had to be rehipped to England where it was rebuilt, and 
afterwards vas returned to Manila. The Railroad Company's damage by reason of 
the cost of repairs, expenses, and loss of he use of the boiler proved to be 
P22,343.29; and as to the amount of the damage so resulting there is practically 
io dispute. To recover these damages the present action was instituted by the 
Railroad Company against the Steamship Company. The latter caused the Atlantic 
Company to be brought in as a codefendant, and insisted that whatever liability 
existed should be fixed upon the Atlantic Company as an independent contractor 
who had underaken to discharge the boilers and had become responsible or such 
damage as had been done.</p>
<p>The judge of the Court of First Instance gave judgment in favor of the 
plaintiff against the Atlantic Company, but absolved the Steamship Company from 
the complaint. The plaintiff has appealed from the action of the court in 
failing to give judgment against the Steamship Company, while the Atlantic 
Company has appealed from the judgment against it.</p>
<p>The mishap was undoubtedly due, as the lower court found, to the negligence 
of one Leyden, the foreman in charge; and we may add that the evidence tends to 
show that his negligence was of a type which may without exaggeration be 
denominated gross. The sling was in the first place improperly adjusted, and the 
attention of Leyden was at once called to this by the man in charge of the 
stevedores. Nevertheless he proceeded and, instead of lowering the boiler when 
it was seen that it could not readily pass through the hatch, he attempted to 
force it through; and the ship's tackle was brought into use to assist in this 
maneuver. The second fall was, it appears, caused by the weakening of the bolt 
at the head of the derrick boom, due to the shock incident to the first 
accident. This defect was possibly such as not to be patent to external 
observation but we are of the opinion that a person of sufficient skill to be 
trusted with the operation of machinery of this character should have known that 
the crane had possibly been weakr ened by the jar received in the first 
accident. The foreman was therefore guilty of negligence in attempting to hoist 
the boiler the second time under the conditions that had thus developed. It 
should be noted that the operation was at all its stages entirely under Leyden's 
control; and, although in the first lift he utilized the ship's tackle to aid in 
hoisting the boiler, everything was done under his immediate supervision. There 
is no evidence tending to show that the first fall of the boiler might hatfe 
been due to any hidden defect in the lifting apparatus; and if it had not been 
for the additional strain caused by one end of the boiler catching under the 
hatch, the operation would doubtless have been accomplished without difficulty. 
The accident is therefore to be attributed to the failure of Leyden to exercise 
the degree of care which an ordinarily competent and prudent person would have 
exhibited under the circumstances which then confronted him. This conclusion of 
fact cannot be refuted; and, indeed, no attempt is here made by the appellant to 
reverse this finding of the trial court.</p>
<p>Three questions are involved in the case, namely: (1) Is the Steamship 
Company liable to the plaintiff by reason of having delivered the boiler in 
question in a damaged condition? (2) Is the Atlantic Company liable to be made 
to respond to the steamship company for the amount the latter may be required to 
pay to the plaintiff for the damage done? (3) Is the Atlantic Company directly 
liable to the plaintiff, as the trial court held?</p>
<p>It will be observed that a contractual relation existed between the Railroad 
Company and the Steamship Company; and the duties of the latter with respect to 
the carrying and delivery of the boilers are to be discovered by considering the 
terms and legal effect of that contract. A contractual relation also existed 
between the Steamship Company and the Atlantic Company; and the duties owing by 
the latter to the former with respect to the lifting and the transferring of the 
boilers are likewise to be discovered by considering the terms and legal effect 
of the contract between these parties. On the other hand, no contractual 
relation existed directly between the Railroad Company and the Atlantic 
Company.</p>
<p>We are all agreed, that, under the contract for transportation from England 
to Manila, the Steamship Company is liable to the plaintiff for the injury done 
to the boiler while it was being discharged from the ship. The obligation to 
transport the boiler necessarily involves the duty to convey and deliver it in a 
proper condition according to its nature, and conformably with good faith, 
custom, and the law (art. 1258, Civ. Code). The contract to convey imports the 
duty to convey and deliver safely and securely with reference to the degree of 
care which, under the circumstances, are required by law and custom applicable 
to the case. The duty to carry and to carry safely is all one.</p>
<p>Such being the contract of the Steamship Company, said company is necessarily 
liable, under articles 1103 and 1104 of the Civil Code, for the consequences of 
the omission of the care necessary to the proper performance of its obligation. 
The contract to transport and deliver at the port of Manila a locomotive boiler, 
which was received by it in proper condition, is not complied with by delivery 
at the port of destination of a mass of iron the utility of which had been 
destroyed.</p>
<p>Nor does the Steamship Company escape liability by reason of the fact that it 
employed a competent independent contractor to discharge the boilers. The law 
applicable to this feature of the case will be more fully discussed further on 
in this opinion. At this point we merely observe that in the performance of this 
service the Atlantic Company was no more than a servant or employee of the 
Steamship Company, and it has never yet been held that the failure to comply 
with a contractual obligation can be excused by showing that such delinquency 
was due to the negligence of one to whom the contracting party had committed the 
performance of the contract.</p>
<p>Coming to the question of the liability of the Atlantic Company to respond to 
the Steamship Company for the damages which the latter will be compelled to pay 
to the plaintiff, we observe that the defense of the Atlantic Company comprises 
two contentions, to-wit, first, that by the terms of the engagement in 
accordance with which the Atlantic Company agreed to render the service, all 
risk incident to the discharge of the boilers was assumed by the Steamship 
Company; and secondly, that the Atlantic Company should be absolved under the 
last paragraph of article 1903 of the Civil Code, inasmuch as it had used due 
care in the selection of the employee whose negligent act caused the damage in 
question.</p>
<p>At the hearing in first instance the Atlantic Company introduced four 
witnesses to prove that at the time said company agreed to lift the boilers out 
of the <em>Alicante</em>, as upon other later occasions, the Steamship Company 
was notified that the service would only be rendered upon the distinct 
understanding that the Atlantic Company would not be responsible for damage. In 
this connection the president of the company testified that he stipulated that 
the company would assume no responsibility for any damage which might be done to 
the lifts or to the steamer or to its contents or to individuals during the 
progress of making these lifts, from any source whatever in connection with the 
breaking of the lifting equipment. The vice-president of the Atlantic Company 
testified that he was present upon the occasion when the agent .of the Steamship 
Company made arrangements for the discharge of the boilers and he heard the 
conversation between the president and said agent. According to this witness the 
substance of the agreement was that, while the Atlantic Company would use all 
due care in getting the boilers out, no responsibility was assumed for damage 
done either to ship or cargo. The intermediary who acted as agent for the 
Steamship Company in arranging for the performance of this service stoutly 
denied that any such terms were announced by the officials or anybody else 
connected with the Atlantic Company at any time while the arrangements were 
pending.</p>
<p>In the conflict of the evidence, we recognize that, by a preponderance of the 
evidence, some reservation or other was made as to tlie responsibility of the 
Atlantic Company; and though the agent who acted on behalf of the Steamship 
Company possibly never communicated this reservation to his principal, the 
latter should nevertheless be held bound thereby. It thus becomes necessary to 
discover what the exact terms of this supposed reservation were.</p>
<p>We think that we must put aside at once the words of studied precision with 
which the president of the Atlantic Company would exclude the possibility of any 
liability attaching to his company, though we may accept his statement as 
showing that the excepted risk contemplated breakage of the lifting equipment. 
There is undoubtedly a larger element of truth in the more reasonable statement 
by the vice-president of the company. According to this witness the contract 
combined two features, namely, an undertaking on the part of the Atlantic 
Company to use all due care, combined with a reservation concerning the 
company's liability for damage.</p>
<p>The Atlantic Company offered in evidence a. number of letters which had been 
written by it at different times, extending over a period of years, in response 
to inquiries made by other firms and persons in Manila concerning the terms upon 
which the Atlantic Company would make heavy lifts. These letters tend to show 
that the Atlantic Company was not accustomed to assume the risk incident to such 
work and required the parties for whom the service might be rendered either to 
carry the risk or insure against it. One such letter, dated nearly four years 
prior to the occurrence which gave rise to this lawsuit, was addressed to the 
<em>Compañia Trasatlantica de Barcelona</em> one of the defendants in this case. 
It was stated in this communication that the company's derrick would be subject 
to inspection prior to making the lift but that the Atlantic Company would not 
assume responsibility for any damage that might occur either to ship or cargo 
from any cause whatsoever. The Steamship Company rejected the services of the 
Atlantic Company in that instance as being too onerous.</p>
<p>The letters directed to third parties, it may be observed, would not, 
generally speaking, be admissible as against the plaintiff for the purpose of 
proving that a similar reservation was inserted in the contract with it on this 
occasion; but if knowledge of such custom is brought home to the Steamship 
Company, the fact that such reservation was commonly made is of some probative 
force. Reference to a number of these letters will show that no particular 
formula was used by the Atlantic Company in defining its exemption, and the 
tenor of these various communications differs materially. We think, however, 
that some of the letters are of value as an aid in interpreting the reservation 
which the Atlantic Company may have intended to make. We therefore quote from 
some of these letters as follows:</p>
<p>"We will use our best endeavors to carry out the work successfully and will 
ask you to inspect our plant but we wish it distinctly understood that we cannot 
assume responsibility for damage which may occur * * * while the lift is being 
made." (To Rear Admiral, U. S. N., Oct. 4, 1909.)</p>
<p>"Our quotation is based on the understanding that we assume no responsibility 
whatever from any accident which may happen during our operations. We always 
insert this clause as a precautionary measure, but we have never had to avail 
ourselves of it as yet and do not expect to now." (To "El Varadero de Manila," 
Nov. 1, 1913.)</p>
<p>"As is customary in these cases, we will use all precautions necessary to 
handle the gun in a proper manner. Our equipment has been tested and will be 
again, before making the lift, but we do not assume any responsibility for 
damage to the gun ship, or cargo." (To Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., June 7, 
1909.)</p>
<p>The idea expressed in these letters is, we think, entirely consonant with the 
interpretation which the vice-president of the company placed upon the contract 
which was made with the Steamship Company upon this occasion, that is, the 
company recognized its duty to exercise due supervisory care; and the exemption 
from liability, whatever may have been its precise words, had reference to 
disasters which might result from some inherent hidden defect in the lifting 
apparatus or other unforeseen occurrence not directly attributable to negligence 
of the company in the lifting operations. Neither party could have supposed for 
a moment that it was intended to absolve the Atlantic Company from its duty to 
use due care in the work.</p>
<p>It is not pretended that negligence on the part of the Atlantic Company or 
its employees was expressly included in the excepted risk, and we are of the 
opinion that the contract should not be understood as covering such an 
exemption. It is a rudimentary principle that the contractor is responsible for 
the work executed by persons whom he employs in its performance, and this is 
expressed in the Civil Code in the form of a positive rule of law (art. 1596). 
It is also expressly declared by law that liability arising from negligence is 
demandable in the fulfillment of all kinds of obligations (art. 1103, Civil 
Code). Every contract for the prestation of service therefore has annexed to it, 
as an inseparable implicit obligation, the. duty to exercise due care in the 
accomplishment of the work; and no reservation whereby the person rendering the 
services seeks to escape from the consequences of a violation of this obligation 
can be viewed with favor.</p>
<p>"Contracts against liability for negligence are not favored by the law. In 
some instances, such as common carriers, they are prohibited as against public 
policy. In all cases such contracts should be construed strictly, with every 
intendment against the party seeking its protection." (Crew <em>vs</em>. 
Bradstreet Company, 134 Pa. St., 161; 7 L. R. A., 661; 19 Am. St. Rep., 
681.)</p>
<p>The strictness with which contracts conferring such an unusual exemption are 
construed is illustrated in Bryan <em>vs</em>. Eastern &amp; Australian S. S. 
Co. (28 Phil. Rep., 310). The decision in that case is not precisely applicable 
to the case at bar, since the court was there applying the law of a foreign 
jurisdiction, and the question at issue involved a doctrine peculiar to 
contracts of common carriers. Nevertheless the case is instructive as 
illustrating the universal attitude of courts upon the right of a contracting 
party to stipulate against the consequences of his own negligence. It there 
appeared that the plaintiff had purchased from the defendant company a ticket 
for the transportation of himself and baggage from Hongkong to Manila. By the 
terms of the contract printed in legible type upon the back of the ticket it was 
provided that the company would not hold itself responsible for any loss or 
damage to luggage, under any circumstances whatsoever, unless it had been paid 
for as freight. It was held that this limitation upon the liability of the 
defendant company did not relieve it from liability for negligence of its 
servants by which the baggage of the passenger was lost. Said the court: 
"Ordinarily this language would seem to be broad enough to cover every possible 
contingency, including the negligent act of the defendant's servants. To so 
hold, however, would run counter to the established law of England and the 
United States on that subject. The court then quoted the following proposition 
from the decision of the King's Bench Division in Price &amp; Co. <em>vs</em>. 
Union Lighterage Co. ([1903], 1 K. B. D., 750, 754) :</p>
<p>" 'An exemption in general words not expressly relating to negligence, even 
though the words are wide enough to include loss by negligence or default of 
carriers' servants, must be construed as limiting the liability of the carrier 
as assurer, and not as relieving him from the duty of exercising reasonable 
skill and care.' "</p>
<p>Even admitting that, generally speaking, a person may stipulate against 
liability for the consequences of negligence, at least in those cases where the 
negligence is not gross or wilful, the contract conferring such exemption must 
be so clear as to leave no room for the operation of the ordinary rules of 
liability consecrated by experience and sanctioned by the express provisions of 
law.</p>
<p>If the exemption should be understood in the sense which counsel for the 
Atlantic Company now insists it should bear, that is, as an absolute exemption 
from all responsibility for negligence, it is evident that the agreement was a 
most inequitable and unfair one, and hence it is one that the Steamship Company 
can not be lightly assumed to have made. Understood in that sense it is the 
equivalent of licensing the Atlantic Company to perform its tasks in any manner 
and fashion that it might please, and to hold it harmless from the 
consequences.</p>
<p>It is true that, in these days, insurance can usually be obtained in the 
principal ports of commerce by parties circumstanced as was the steamship 
company in the case now before us. But the best insurance against disasters of 
this kind is found in the exercise of due care; and the chief incentive to the 
exercise of care is a feeling of responsibility on the part of him who 
undertakes the work. Naturally the courts are little inclined to aid in the 
efforts of contractors to evade this responsibility.</p>
<p>There may have been in the minds of the officials of the Atlantic Company an 
idea that the promise to use due care in the lifting operations was not 
accompanied by a legal obligation, such promise being intended merely for its 
moral effect as an assurance to the steamship company that the latter might rely 
upon the competence and diligence of the employees of the Atlantic Company to 
accomplish the work in a proper way. The contract can not be permitted to 
operate in this onesided manner. The two features of the engagement, namely, the 
promise to use due care and the exemption from liability for damage should be so 
construed as to give some legal effect to both. The result is, as already 
indicated, that the Atlantic Company was bound by its undertaking to use due 
care and that the exemption was intended to cover accidents due to hidden 
defects in the apparatus or other unforeseeable occurrences not having their 
origin in the immediate personal negligence of the party in charge of the 
operations.</p>
<p>We now proceed to consider the contention that the Atlantic Company should be 
absolved from liability to the Steamship Company under the last paragraph of 
article 1903 of the Civil Code, which declares that the liability there referred 
to shall cease when the persons mentioned therein prove that they employed all 
the diligence of a good father of a family to avoid the damage. In this 
connection the conclusion of fact must be conceded in favor of the Atlantic 
Company that it had used proper care in the selection of Leyden and that, so far 
as the company was aware, he was a person to whom might properly be committed 
the task of discharging the boilers. The answer to the contention, however, is 
that the obligation of the Atlantic Company was created by contract, and article 
1903 is not applicable to negligence arising in the course of the performance of 
a contractual obligation. Article 1903 is exclusively concerned with cases where 
the negligence arises in the absence of agreement.</p>
<p>In discussing the liability of the Steamship Company to the plaintiff 
Railroad Company we have already shown that a party is bound to the full 
performance of his contractual engagements under articles 1101 <em>et seq</em>. 
of the Civil Code, and other special provisions of the Code relative to 
contractual obligations; and if he falls short of complete performance by reason 
of his own negligence or that of any person to whom he may commit the work, he 
is liable for the damages resulting therefrom. What was there said is also 
applicable with reference to the liability of the Atlantic Company upon its 
contract with the Steamship Company, and the same need not be here repeated. It 
is desirable, however, in this connection, to bring out somewhat more fully the 
distinction between negligence in the performance of a contractual obligation 
(culpa contractual) and negligence considered as an independent source of 
obligation between parties not previously bound (culpa aquiliana).</p>
<p>This distinction is well established in legal jurisprudence and is fully 
recognized in the provisions of the Civil Code. As illustrative of this, we 
quote the following passage from the opinion of this Court in the well-known 
case of Rakes <em>vs</em>. Atlantic, Gulf &amp; Pacific Co. (7 Phil. Rep., 359, 
365), and in this quotation we reproduce the first paragraph of the passage from 
Manresa chiefly for the purpose of here presenting a more correct English 
version of said passage.</p>
<p>"The acts to which these articles are applicable are understood to be those 
not growing out of preexisting duties of the parties to one another. But where 
relations already formed give rise to duties, whether springing from contract or 
quasi contract, then breaches of those duties are subject to articles 1101, 
1103, and 1104 of the same code. A typical application of this distinction may 
be found in the consequences of a railway accident due to defective machinery 
supplied by the employer. His liabilty to his employee would arise out of the 
contract of employment, that to the passengers out of the contract for passage, 
while that to the injured by-stander would originate in the negligent act 
itself. This distinction is thus clearly set forth by Manresa in his commentary 
on article 1093:</p>
<p>" 'We see with reference to such obligations, that <em>culpa</em>, or 
negligence, may be understood in two different senses, either as <em>culpa</em>, 
<em>substantive</em> and <em>independent</em>, which of itself constitutes the 
source of an obligation between two persons not formerly bound by any other 
obligation; or as an <em>incident</em> in the performance of an obligation which 
already existed, which can not be presumed to exist without the other, and which 
increases the liability arising from the already existing obligation.1"</p>
<p>Justice Tracey, the author of the opinion from which we have quoted, proceeds 
to observe that Manresa, in commenting on articles 1102 and 1104, has described 
these two species of negligence as contractual and extra-contractual, the latter 
being the culpa aquiliana of the Roman law. "This terminology is unreservedly 
accepted by Sanchez Roman (<em>Derecho Civil</em>, fourth section, chapter XI, 
article II, No. 12), and the principle stated is supported by decisions of the 
supreme court of Spain, among them those of November 20, 1896 (80 
<em>Jurisprudencia Civil</em>, No. 151), and June 27, 1894 (75 
<em>Jurisprudencia Civil</em>, No. 182.)"</p>
<p>The principle that negligence in the performance of a contract is not 
governed by article 1903 of the Civil Code but rather by article 1104 of the 
same Code was directly applied by this court in the case of Baer Senior &amp; 
Co.'s Successors <em>vs</em>. Compañia Maritima (6 Phil. Rep., 215); and the 
same idea has been impliedly if not expressly recognized in other cases (N. T. 
Hashim &amp; Co. <em>vs</em>. Rocha &amp; Co., 18 Phil. Rep., 315; Tan Chiong 
Sian <em>vs</em>. Inchausti &amp; Co., 22 Phil. Rep., 152).</p>
<p>What has been said suffices in our opinion to demonstrate that the Atlantic 
Company is liable to the Steamship Company for the damages brought upon the 
latter by the failure of the Atlantic Company to use due care in discharging the 
boiler, regardless of the fact that the damage was caused by the negligence of 
an employee who was qualified for the work and who had been chosen by the 
Atlantic Company with due care.</p>
<p>This brings us to the last question here to be answered, which is; Can the 
Atlantic Company be held directly liable to the Railroad Company? In other 
words, can the judgment entered in the trial court directly in favor of the 
plaintiff against the Atlantic Company be sustained? To answer this it is 
necessary to examine carefully the legal relations existing between the Atlantic 
Company and the Railroad Company with reference to this affair; and we shall for 
a moment ignore the existence of the contract between the Steamship Company and 
the Atlantic Company, to which the railroad company was not a party.</p>
<p>Having regard then to the bare fact that the Atlantic Company undertook to 
remove the boiler from the ship's hold and for this purpose took the property 
into its power and control, there arose a duty to the owner to use due care in 
the performance of that service and to avoid damaging the property in the course 
of such operation. This duty was obviously in existence before the negligent act 
was done which resulted in damage, and said negligent act may, if we still 
ignore the existence of the express contract, be considered as an act done in 
violation of this duty.</p>
<p>The duty thus to use due care is an implied obligation, of a quasi 
contractual nature, since it is created by implication of law in the absence of 
express agreement. The conception of liability with which we are here confronted 
is somewhat similar to that which is revealed in the case of the depositary, or 
commodatary, whose legal duty with respect to the property committed to their 
care is defined by law even in the absence of express contract; and it can not 
be doubted that a person who takes possession of the property of another for the 
purpose of moving or conveying it from one place to another, or for the purpose 
of performing any other service in connection therewith (<em>locatio operis 
faciendi</em>), owes to the owner a positive duty to refrain from damaging it, 
to the same extent as if an agreement for the performance of such service had 
been expressly made with the owner. The obligation here is really a species of 
contract <em>re</em>, and it has its source and explanation in the vital fact 
that the active party has taken upon himself to do something with or to the 
property and has taken it into his power and control for the purpose of 
performing such service. (Compare art. 1889, Civil Code.)</p>
<p>In the passage which we have already quoted from the decision in the Rakes 
case this Court recognized the fact that the violation of a quasi contractual 
duty is subject to articles 1101, 1103, and 1104 of the Civil Code and not 
within the purview of article 1903. Manresa also, in the paragraph reproduced 
above, is of the opinion that negligence, considered as a substantive and 
independent source of liability, does not include cases where the parties are 
previously bound by any other obligation. Again, it is instructive in this 
connection to refer to the contents of article 1103 of the Civil Code, where it 
is declared that the liability proceeding from negligence is demandable in the 
fulfillment of all kinds of obligations. These words evidently comprehend both 
forms of positive obligations, whether arising from express contract or from 
implied contract (quasi contract).</p>
<p>In this connection it is instructive to recall the celebrated case of Coggs 
<em>vs</em>. Bernard (2 Ld. Raym, 909), decided in the court of the King's Bench 
of England in the year 1703. The action was brought by the owner of certain 
casks of brandy to recover damages from a person who had undertaken to transport 
them from one place to another. It was alleged that in so doing the defendant so 
negligently and improvidently put them down that one of the casks was staved and 
the brandy lost. The complaint did not allege that the defendant was a common 
carrier or that he was to be paid for his services. It was therefore considered 
that the complaint did not state facts sufficient to support an action for 
breach of any express contract. This made it necessary for the court to go back 
to fundamental principles and to place liability on the ground of a violation of 
the legal duty incident to the mere fact of carriage. Said Powell, J.: "An 
action indeed will not lie for not doing the thing, for want of a sufficient 
consideration ; but yet if the bailee will take the goods into his custody, he 
shall be answerable for them; for the taking of the goods into his custody is 
his own act." So Gould, J.: "* * * any man that undertakes to carry goods is 
liable to an action, be he a common carrier or whatever he is, if through his 
neglect they are lost or come to any damage: * * *." Behind these expressions 
was an unbroken line of ancient English precedents holding persons liable for 
damage inflicted by reason of a misfeasance in carrying out an undertaking. The 
principle determined by the court in the case cited is expressed in the syllabus 
in these words: "If a man undertakes to carry goods safely and securely, he is 
responsible for any damage they may sustain in the carriage through his neglect, 
though he was not a common carrier and was to have nothing for the carriage." 
Though not stated in so many words, this decision recognizes that from the mere 
fact that a person takes the property of another into his possession and control 
there arises an obligation in the nature of an assumpsit that he will use due 
care with respect thereto. This must be considered a principle of universal 
jurisprudence, for it is consonant with justice and common sense and as we have 
already seen harmonizes with the doctrine above deduced from the provisions of 
the Civil Code.</p>
<p>The conclusion must therefore be that if there had been no contract of any 
sort between the Atlantic Company and the Steamship Company, an action, could 
have been main tained by the Railroad Company, as owner, against the Atlantic 
Company to recover the damages sustained by the former. Such damages would have 
been demandable under article 1103 of the Civil Code and the action would not 
have been subject to the qualification expressed in the last paragraph of 
article 1903.</p>
<p>The circumstance that a contract was made between the Atlantic Company and 
the Steamship Company introduces, however, an important, and in our opinion, 
controlling factor into this branch of the case. It cannot be denied that the 
Steamship Company had possession of this .boiler in the capacity of carrier and 
that, as such, it was authorized to make a contract with the Atlantic Company to 
discharge the same from the ship. Indeed, it appears in evidence that even 
before the contract of affreightment was made the Railroad Company was informed 
that it would be necessary for the Steamship Company to procure the services of 
some contractor in the port of Manila to effect the discharge, as the ship's 
tackle was inadequate to handle heavy cargo. It is therefore to be assumed that 
the Railroad Company had in fact assented to the employment of a contractor to 
perform this service.</p>
<p>Now, it cannot be admitted that a person who contracts to do a service like 
that rendered by the Atlantic Company in this case incurs a double 
responsibility upon entering upon performance, namely, a responsibility to the 
party with whom he contracted, and another entirely different responsibility to 
the owner, based on an implied contract. The two liabilities can not in our 
opinion coexist. It is a general rule that an implied contract never arises 
where an express contract has been made.</p>
<p>If double responsibility existed in such a case as this, it would result that 
a person who had limited his liability by express stipulation might find himself 
liable to the owner without regard to the limitation which he had seen fit to 
impose by contract. There appears to be no possibility of reconciling the 
conflict that would be developed in attempting to give effect to those 
inconsistent liabilities. The contract which was in fact made, in our opinion, 
determines not only the character and extent of the liability of the Atlantic 
Company but also the person or entity by whom the obligation is exigible. It is 
of course quite clear that if the Atlantic Company had refused to carry out its 
agreement to discharge the cargo, the plaintiff could not have enforced specific 
performance and could not have recovered damages for non-performance. (Art. 
1257, Civil Code; Donaldson, Sim &amp; Co. <em>vs</em>. Smith, Bell &amp; Co., 2 
Phil. Rep., 766; Uy Tarn and Uy Yet <em>vs</em>. Leonard, 30 Phil. Rep., 471.) 
In view of the preceding discussion it is equally obvious that, for lack of 
privity with the contract, the Railroad Company can have no right of action to 
recover damages from the Atlantic Company for the wrongful act which constituted 
the violation of said contract. The rights of the plaintiff can only be made 
effective through the Compania Trasatldntica de Barcelona with whom the contract 
of affreightment was made.</p>
<p>The judgment entered in the Court of First Instance must, therefore, be 
reversed not only with respect to the judgment entered in favor of the plaintiff 
directly against the Atlantic Company but also with respect to the absolution of 
the Steamship Company and the further failure of the court to enter judgment in 
favor of the latter against the Atlantic Company. The <em>Compañia Trasatlantica 
de Barcelona</em> should be and is hereby adjudged to pay to the Manila Railroad 
Company the sum of twenty two thousand three hundred forty three pesos and 
twenty nine centavos (P22,343.29), with interest from May 11, 1914, until paid; 
and when this judgment is satisfied, the <em>Compañia Trasatlantica de 
Barcelona</em> is declared to be entitled to recover the same amount from the 
Atlantic Gulf &amp; Pacific Company, against whom judgment is to this end hereby 
rendered in favor of the <em>Compañia Trasatlantica de Barcelona</em>. No 
express adjudication of costs of either instance will be made. So ordered.</p>

<p><strong>JOHNSON, J.</strong>, <em>dissenting:</em></p>
<p>The only question presented by the appellant, the Atlantic, Gulf &amp; 
Pacific Company, is whether or not. it is liable, either to the Manila Railroad 
Company, or to the <em>Compañia Trasatlantica</em>, for the damage caused to a 
certain locomotive boiler while being discharged at the port of Manila.</p>
<p>The essential facts important for a decision upon the rights and liabilities 
of the Atlantic, Gulf &amp; Pacific Company may be stated as follows:</p>
<p>(1) That the Manila Railroad Company purchased certain locomotive boilers in 
Europe and contracted with the <em>Compañia Trasatlantica</em> to transport the 
same to Manila by its steamship Alicante; (2) That the tackle and equipment of 
the steamship <em>Alicante</em> being insufficient to discharge said locomotive 
boilers, the <em>Compañia Trasatlantica</em> entered into a contract with the 
Atlantic, Gulf &amp; Pacific Company by virtue of the terms of which the latter 
company agreed to discharge the said locomotive boilers from the said steamship 
<em>Alicante</em> by using its tackle and equipment for that purpose; (3) That 
in the effort of the Atlantic, Gulf &amp; Pacific Company to discharge the said 
locomotive boilers from the said steamship, the apparatus, used, broke and one 
of the boilers was discharged in the manner described in the complaint and 
damaged to the amount found by the lower court; (4) That while the Atlantic, 
Gulf &amp; Pacific Company attempted to show, during the trial of the cause, 
that it and its employees exercised due care and diligence, it admitted in this 
court that its employees had perhaps been negligent in the performance of their 
duties. </p>
<p>Considering that the relations between the <em>Compañia Trasatlantica</em> 
and the Atlantic, Gulf &amp; Pacific Company were contractual, it becomes 
important to ascertain what were the terms of the contract, in order to properly 
understand the rights and liabilities of the parties thereto, in relation to the 
admission of the Atlantic, Gulf &amp; Pacific Company that its employees had 
perhaps been guilty of negligence in the discharge of said boiler.</p>
<p>The contract was not wholly reduced to writing; it was partly written and 
partly oral. The <em>Compañia Trasatlantica</em> alleged that under the terms of 
the contract the Atlantic, Gulf &amp; Pacific Company was to discharge said 
boilers from the steamship Alicante, using its tackle and apparatus therefor, 
and that no condition of <em>any</em> character was imposed, while the Atlantic, 
Gulf &amp; Pacific Company alleged that it agreed to discharge said boilers and 
to use its tackle and equipment for that purpose, <em>but with the express 
condition that it was, under no circumstances or conditions, to</em> assume any 
responsibility for any damage whatever which might be occasioned thereby, either 
to the cargo, ship or persons.</p>
<p>In support of the allegation of the <em>Compañia Trasatlantica</em>, it 
really presented but one witness, while the Atlantic, Gulf &amp; Pacific Company 
presented several witnesses, including its president, vice-president and several 
others, together with a number of documents showing that the contract was in 
conformity with its usual custom in making similar contracts. The Atlantic, Gulf 
&amp; Pacific Company also showed that the <em>Compañia Trasatlantica</em> had 
actual knowledge of such custom.</p>
<p>A careful examination of the proof, in our opinion, clearly shows by a large 
preppnderance, that the contract in question was as the Atlantic, Gulf &amp; 
Pacific Company alleged 'and that by its terms said company (A. G. &amp; P.) was 
relieved "of any responsibility for any damage which might occur either to the 
ship, cargo or persons, <em>from any cause whatsoever</em>"</p>
<p>The contract is the law governing the rights and obligations of the parties, 
subject to certain well defined exceptions. Persons have a right to enter into 
any contract with any clauses, or conditions, or limitations which they may deem 
convenient and advisable so long as such clauses or conditions do not conflict 
with the existing laws, morals or public order. (Art. 1255, Civil Code.) There 
are some well defined exceptions to that rule, the most notable of which are 
contracts with common carriers. (Hartford F. Ins. Co., <em>vs</em>. Chicago, M. 
&amp; St. P. Railway Co., 175 U. S., 91, 97.) The Atlantic, Gulf &amp; Pacific 
Company, so far as the record shows, is not a common carrier, and the exception, 
therefore, just noted does not apply to it. Neither was the contract between the 
<em>Compañia Trasatlantica</em> and the Atlantic, Gulf &amp; Pacific Company a 
contract for the carriage of merchandise. It was a contract for services of an 
entirely different character from that of a common carrier.</p>
<p>If then, generally speaking, persons may enter into contractual relations 
with any clauses or conditions which they may deem advisable and convenient, 
which do not conflict with existing laws, morals or public order, we may ask: Is 
a contract of the character of that before us in which one of the parties 
stipulates "that he will not assume any responsibility for any damage which may 
occur from any cause whatsoever" in the execution of said contract, contrary to 
the laws, morals or public order?</p>
<p>The contract in question was not one which the parties were obliged to enter 
into. In that respect, it differed from contracts with common carriers, wherein 
the latter have no option, generally speaking. In the present case, the 
Atlantic, Gulf &amp; Pacific Company had a perfect right to refuse to enter into 
the contract in question until and unless its terms were satisfactory and 
acceptable. The parties being at perfect liberty to enter into the contract or 
to refuse so to do, they must be bound by the law which they themselves have 
made for themselves. Having voluntarily made the law (contract), they must abide 
by its terms until it can be shown that the same is contrary to the laws, morals 
or public order.</p>
<p>It is a fundamental rule of the law that what one may refuse to do entirely, 
he may agree to do upon such terms as he pleases so long as he does not 
contravene the laws, morals or public order. The Atlantic, Gulf &amp; Pacific 
Company having had the right to refuse absolutely to enter into the contract, it 
must have had the right to refuse to enter into it except upon just such terms 
and conditions as it saw fit to require. The Atlantic, Gulf &amp; Pacific 
Company, therefore, had a right to refuse to enter into the contract in question 
until and unless the <em>Compañia Trasatlantica</em> agreed to relieve it of all 
responsibility for <em>any damages</em> which might occur either to the ship, 
cargo or persons from any <em>cause whatsoever</em>. By the terms of the 
contract the <em>Compañia Trasatlantica</em> assumed <em>all responsibility</em> 
for damages in the discharge of the said locomotive boilers. That must be true 
considering that, by the terms of the contract, the Atlantic, Gulf &amp; Pacific 
Company was relieved from any and all damages whatsoever which might occur.</p>
<p>The only purpose on the part of the Atlantic, Gulf &amp; Pacific Company, in 
imposing the condition above-mentioned, was to avoid the consequences of the 
negligence of its agents or employees or of any act or accident which might 
cause damage, and to avoid possible lawsuits growing out of the alleged 
negligent acts.</p>
<p>The question which we are discussing is not a new one in jurisprudence. The 
courts have been called upon many times to interpret contracts with conditions 
like those contained in the contract before us. (Coup <em>vs</em>. Wabash, St. 
Louis &amp; Pac. Railway Co., 56 Mich., Ill; 56 Am. Rep., 374; Mann <em>vs</em>. 
Pere Marquette R. Co., 135 Mich., 210; Stephens <em>vs</em>. Southern Pacific 
Co., 109 Cal., 86; 29 L. R. A., 751; Quimby <em>vs</em>. Boston &amp; Maine R., 
150 Mass., 365; 5 L. R. A., 846; Pittsburgh, etc. Railway Co. <em>vs</em>. 
Mahoney, 148 Ind., 196; Russell <em>vs</em>. Pittsburgh, etc., R. Co., 157 Ind., 
305; 55 L. R. A., 253; Hartford Fire Ins. Co. <em>vs</em>. Chicago, M. &amp; St. 
P. Railway Co., 175 U. S., 91, 97; Baltimore, etc. Railway Co. <em>vs</em>. 
Voigt, 176 U. S., 498; Osgood <em>vs</em>. Railway Co., 77 Vermont, 334; 70 L. 
R. A., 930.)</p>
<p>In the case of the Hartford Insurance Company <em>vs</em>. Chicago, M. &amp; 
St. P. Railway Co. (175 U. S., 91, 97, <em>supra</em>). a contract was made by 
which one of the parties was relieved from <em>all</em> liability for damage, et 
cetera, et cetera, even the liability for damage which might result "from the 
carelessness or negligence of employees or agents of said railway company," and 
the Supreme Court of the United States held that such a condition in contracts 
of that character was not void as against public policy, or public morals or 
contrary to law. (Baltimore, etc. Railway Co. <em>vs</em>. Voigt, 176 U. S., 
498; Osgood <em>vs</em>. Central Vermont R. Co., 77 Vermont, 334; 70 L. R. A., 
930.)</p>
<p>Courts must not forget that they are not to extend, arbitrarily, those rules 
which say that a given contract is void as being against public policy, or 
public laws, because if there is one thing which more than another public policy 
requires, it is that men of full age and competent understanding shall have the 
utmost liberty of contracting, and that their contracts when entered into freely 
and voluntarily, shall be held sacred and must be enforced in courts of justice. 
Courts should not lightly interfere with the freedom of contracts. (Baltimore, 
etc., Railway Co. <em>vs</em>. Voigt, 176 U. S., 498; Printing, etc. Company 
<em>vs</em>. Sampson, Law Reps., 19 Equity, 465; Osgood <em>vs</em>. Central 
Vermont R. Co., 77 Vermont, 334.)</p>
<p>The record shows that the Atlantic, Gulf &amp; Pacific Company had, at 
various times, discharged other freight from steamships in Manila Bay of much 
greater weight than the boiler in question, by means of the same tackle and 
equipment and by the same employees which were used in the present case. The 
record also shows that the tackle and equipment was ample and that the men in 
charge were experienced in the work they were to perform. The record further 
shows that the Atlantic, Gulf &amp; Pacific Company undertook the discharge of 
said boilers at a very low price, for the very reason that they were relieved of 
all liability whatsoever for damages in the discharge of the same. The record 
further shows that the representative of the <em>Compañia Trasatlantica</em>, 
who made the contract in question, was requested to and did make a casual 
examination of the tackle and equipment which were to be used in the discharge 
of the boilers. The record further shows that said company, after receiving the 
information that the tackle and equipment and employees of the Atlantic, Gulf 
&amp; Pacific Company had discharged, on various occasions, other and heavier 
freight without accident or mishap, and after having made a casual examination 
of such equipment, voluntarily and willingly and without any objection or 
protest for and on behalf of the <em>Compañia Trasatlantica</em>, entered into 
the contract as above described, accepting fully and without protest the 
conditions imposed by the Atlantic, Gulf &amp; Pacific Company. Having entered 
into the contract in question and the same not being in contravention of the 
laws, morals or public order, the <em>Compañia Trasatlantica</em> is bound by 
its terms.</p>
<p>The rule above announced may seem to be a hard one, but when we remember that 
the right to enter into contracts carries with it the freedom to impose such 
conditions as the parties may see fit to impose, subject to specific 
limitations, the hardship, if any, is one self-imposed by the parties.</p>
<p>An example may serve to make the rule which we have announced plainer:</p>
<p>A is the owner of an automobile at Manila which he desires to deliver at 
Baguio. B is the owner of a garage at Manila and has in his employ experienced 
chauffeurs. A desires to employ B to take the automobile to Baguio and offers a 
certain price for the services. B accepts A's proposition with the condition 
that he will assume no responsibility whatever for any damages which might occur 
to the said automobile in the course of it? delivery. In passing the 
<em>zigzag</em> on the way to Baguio, an unforeseen accident happens through the 
casual neglect or lack of care on the part of the chauffeur and the automobile 
is damaged. Can B be held liable, in an action upon the contract, for the 
damages in the face of the fact that A had relieved him of all liability for any 
damages which might occur? The cases which we have cited above, together with 
many others which might be cited, all answer that question in the negative. That 
question is answered in the negative upon the theory that A, by the terms of his 
contract, relieved B, in an action upon the contract, from all liability 
whatsoever.</p>
<p>It must not be forgotten that what we have said relates to actions upon the 
contract with the conditions mentioned and not to actions for damages in an 
action <em>ex delicto</em> resulting from the negligent performance of duties 
and obligations assumed.</p>
<p>The appellant, the Atlantic, Gulf &amp; Pacific Company, contends that 
inasmuch as it had exercised the care of a good father of a family in selecting 
its employees, that it should be relieved from all liability by virtue of the 
provisions of article 1903 of the Civil Code. We do not believe that the 
provisions of said article can be invoked when the rights and liabilities of 
parties to an action depend upon a contract. The rights of parties are defined 
by the contract and there is no occasion to invoke the statute. The argument 
employed by the Atlantic, Gulf &amp; Pacific Company, if valid, would also 
relieve the <em>Compañia Trasatlantica</em> from all liability. Certainly, the 
Atlantic, Gulf &amp; Pacific Company would not deny that the <em>Compañia 
Trasatlantica</em> had not exercised the care of a good father of a family in 
selecting it for the discharge of said boilers. Neither do we believe that the 
provisions of article 1902 of the Civil Code can be invoked in favor of the 
<em>Compañia Trasatlantica</em>, for the reason that the contract governs the 
rights and liabilities and by the terms of the contract the Atlantic, Gulf &amp; 
Pacific Company is <em>relieved from all liability whatsoever</em>. A relief 
from <em>all liability</em> is a relief from any liability caused by negligence, 
especially so when the action is based upon a contract. Whether or not that rule 
should be followed in an action of tort growing out of wilful negligence, 
<em>quaere</em>?</p>
<p>From all of the foregoing, we are persuaded that the judgment of the lower 
court should be modified and that the Atlantic, Gulf &amp; Pacific Company 
should be relieved from all liability under the complaint.</p></div>
