				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. RUPERTO T. SANTIAGO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The appellant in this case was convicted of the crime of <em>estafa,</em> and 
sentenced to five months of <em>arresto mayor</em> and to pay the costs of the 
proceedings.
<p>The commission of the alleged offense is charged in the information as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That during or about the month of April, 1912, in the municipality of 
Iloilo, Province of Iloilo, Philippine Islands, the said accused, being an agent 
of The West Coast Life Insurance Company, and entrusted with collecting on 
policies of said company, did wilfully, maliciously, and criminally, with abuse 
of confidence and through deceit, collect from Felix Golez the sum of one 
hundred sixteen pesos and sixty-two centavos (P116.62), by means of delivery of 
the provisional policy No. 889A; and instead of turning in to the treasury of 
said company the amount so collected the said accused did appropriate the same 
to his own personal use, in fraud and to the prejudice of the said West Coast 
Life Insurance Company; an act committed in violation of the 
law."</p></blockquote>
<p>The first question raised on this appeal goes to the jurisdiction of the 
trial court over the offense charged in the information. Relying on the case of 
the United States <em>vs.</em> Cardell (23 Phil. Rep., 207), it is urged that 
the offense as charged was triable in the Court of First Instance of Manila and 
not in Iloilo, it appearing that under defendant's contract with the insurance 
company, the premiums collected by the defendant were payable at its office in 
Manila, In that case, wherein the allegations of the information were 
substantially similar to those in the case at bar, we held that the Court of 
First Instance of Manila had jurisdiction of the offense charged, on the ground 
that under the contract by the defendant with the insurance company, the 
insurance premiums collected by him in Cebu were payable in the offices of the 
company in the city of Manila, and that the offense charged—that is to say, the 
failure to remit these premiums—was triable in Manila because it was consummated 
by the failure of the defendant in that case to turn over the funds at the 
office of the company in Manila. We did not hold in the former case, however, 
that the Court of First Instance of Cebu, where the premiums were collected, did 
not have concurrent jurisdiction with that of Manila; and we are of opinion that 
offenses such as that committed in the case at bar and in the case just cited, 
which are committed partly in one province and partly in another—that is to say, 
where some acts material and essential to the crime and requisite to its 
consummation occur in one province and some in another—the case may be tried in 
either.<br><br>In the case at bar the accused is charged with having collected 
the premium upon a certain policy in the Province of Iloilo and there and then 
appropriating the amount collected to his own use instead of turning it over to 
the company at its offices in Manila in accordance with the terms of his 
contract.</p>
<p>In accordance with our ruling in the case of the United States <em>vs.</em> 
Cardell (<em>supra</em>), the offense, if committed, was partly committed in the 
city of Manila and partly in the Province of Iloilo. The failure to turn over 
the funds to the insurance company in Manila was an act material and essential 
to the crime, and requisite to its consummation. So, also, the alleged 
collection and appropriation of the premium in the Province of Iloilo and the 
failure to remit it to the company in Manila in accordance with the terms of the 
alleged contract was an act material and essential to the crime and requisite to 
its consummation. The offense having been committed partly in the Province of 
Iloilo and partly in the city of Manila we are of opinion that the Court of 
First Instance of that province had concurrent jurisdiction with that of Manila 
over the offense thus committed.</p>
<p>Under the strict rules of the common law, based upon the rule that 
indictments could be found in that county only in which the crime has been 
committed, it was at one time doubtful whether a crime committed partly in one 
county and partly in another could be punished in either. (Bacon Abr. Tit. 
Indictment; 4 Bl. Comm. 303; 1 Chitty Crim. L. 178.) Though it was held that the 
proper view was that such an offense is indictable in the county wherein it is 
consummated, it is now very generally provided by statute that where crimes are 
committed partly in one county and partly in another, the accused is indictable 
in either, and it has been held that such statutes are not repugnant to the 
constitutional provision that the accused shall be entitled to a trial in the 
county where the crime was committed. (Smith<em> vs.</em> State, 42 Florida, 
605.)</p>
<p>Section 6 of General Orders No. 58 provides that: "A complaint or information 
is sufficient if it shows: * * * 4. That the offense was committed within the 
jurisdiction of the court and is triable therein."</p>
<p>As hereinbefore indicated, we are of opinion that in this jurisdiction, where 
the strict common-law rules touching the finding of indictments have no 
controlling influence, offenses committed partly in one province and partly in 
another, that is to say, where some acts material and essential to the crime and 
requisite to its consummation occur in one province and some in another, are 
triable in either province, the appropriate courts in each province having 
concurrent jurisdiction of such offenses under the provisions of the above cited 
section of General Orders No. 58.</p>
<p>No witnesses were called by the prosecution, but certain documents marked 
"Prosecution's Exhibits A, B, and C" were introduced without objection, and the 
defense admitted that the accused had collected the sum of P116.62 mentioned in 
the information and that he had not turned it over to the complainant company. 
Exhibit A is the formal appointment and contract of defendant as an agent of the 
insurance company. Exhibits B and C are reports of the defendant made to the 
company during the term of his employment as its agent.</p>
<p>The evidence for the defense is summarized by the Solicitor-General in his 
brief in this Court, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The defendant, being duly sworn, testified in his own behalf substantially 
as follows: </p>
<p>"I am 28 years of age, married, clerk, and a resident of Iloilo. I was 
formerly an agent of the West Coast Life Insurance Company, and while acting as 
such wrote a policy for Adriano Hernandez, for which I was entitled to a 
commission of F101.67 for the first half year and an additional P101.67 at the 
time of the payment of the second semiannual premium. I did not collect the 
premium on this policy and have not received any commission upon it. I also 
wrote a policy for Cecilio Dayot, for which I am entitled to P51.48 commission 
and which the company has not yet paid to me. The regular agent of the company, 
Jose Maria Igpuara, told me that he had collected the premiums on the 
above-mentioned policies. I also wrote policies for Messrs. Escarilla and 
Peralta, and Luisa Caraza upon which Mr. Igpuara collected the premiums. I 
received certain advances from Igpuara upon these policies, but have not been 
paid in full. I collected the premium on the policy written for Luis Golez, but 
have not turned it over to the company; Exhibit D is the receipt I gave him for 
the amount collected. The premium on the Golez policy was P116.62 and my 
commission thereon was P64.14; and as the company had been owing me P58 for some 
time I did not turn over the P52.48 due the company upon this policy. The 
company is indebted to me in the sum of P208 upon policies written by me. Some 
of this work was done prior to my appointment as agent of the West Coast Life 
Insurance Company, but I had an understanding with Mr. Calvo, the company's 
general agent. Mr. Calvo did not settle with me in full for the work I did for 
him prior to my appointment as agent of the company, and told me to keep the 
first premium that I collected. My contract of employment with the West Coast 
Life Insurance Company calls for the immediate turning over of all premiums 
collected to the company's general agent. The practice of the agents here, 
however, has been to retain the commissions and send the balance of the premiums 
collected to the Manila office. Mr. Northcott was the general agent to whom I 
should report and send premiums after I had signed the contract with the 
company.</p>
<p>"Jose Maria Igpuara, being duly sworn, testified substantially as 
follows:</p>
<p>"I am 28 years of age, married, life insurance agent, and a resident of 
Iloilo. I am an agent of the West Coast Life Insurance Company, and as such know 
that the premiums on the policies belonging to Messrs. Hernandez, Dayot, and 
Colez, and Luisa Caraza have been paid. The defendant was employed by Calvo 
while the latter was the agent of the West Coast Life Insurance Company. As such 
subagent the defendant was responsible only to the agent who appointed him and, 
not to the company; that is, the company had nothing to do with him. When Mr. 
Gray, cashier of the company, came here he suspended the defendant as agent for 
the company. Mr. Gray then took charge of the premium on Governor Hernandez's 
policy and I was sent to collect it. Governor Hernandez told me that he could 
not pay the entire amount of the premium at that time, but gave me his 
promissory note for P116 to be credited on account of the premium due on his 
policy. Mr. Hernandez did not owe the defendant any commission on account of his 
policy that I know of. The defendant wrote policies for Luisa Caraza and Cecilio 
Dayot, and secured certain advances from some policy holders. When the defendant 
was dismissed I received a letter from Mr. Northcott, directing me to collect 
all of the papers in the hands of the defendant and I made a demand upon him for 
such papers as he had in his possession, but he has not delivered them to 
me.<br><br>"Ernesto M. Calvo, being duly sworn, testified substantially as 
follows:</p>
<p>"I am 33 years of age, single, and a resident of Iloilo. I was formerly agent 
of the West Coast Life Insurance Company for the Provinces of Panay and Negros. 
I appointed the defendant an agent of the company in February or March last. I 
was authorized to appoint agents the same as Mr. Northcott. I had a number of 
agents working for me down here and they looked to me for their commission. The 
agents appointed by me were also appointed by the company, because I was not 
allowed to appoint without the consent of the company. I do not owe the 
defendant anything; I don't know whether the company does or not. I told the 
defendant that if a settlement was not made with him he could take what was due 
him out of the first premium he collected. I had no right to do this, but did it 
in order to get him to work for my company, and to show him that I really came 
down here representing Mr. Northcott. I was not authorized to hold out any money 
on premiums collected, but directed to send all moneys collected to Manila. I 
have not made a settlement with the company yet for my services. The defendant 
and I were rivals and could not agree with each other at the time he asked for 
his commissions; I recommended to the company that the defendant be not 
appointed as agent, but he was appointed by the company on May 4. I think the 
defendant had already been appointed by the company when the policy of Felix 
Golez was written. I think I received this policy in April. On July 7 I received 
an order from the company to turn over all papers to Mr. Igpuara, and I did so. 
My contract with the company was the same as the document marked Exhibit A; but 
in addition thereto I had a letter from the company and verbal instructions from 
Mr. Northcott. Mr. Northcott told me I was authorized to do anything, hence he 
is responsible, if anybody is, and not I.</p>
<p>"Adriano Hernandez, being duly sworn, testified substantially as follows:</p>
<p>"I am 42 years of age, married, and am serving as provincial governor of 
Iloilo. I gave this defendant my promissory note for P116 at his request in 
order to assist him to make a payment. This promissory note was not made in 
consideration of any policy of mine issued by the West Coast Life Insurance 
Company. By request of the defendant I made the promissory note payable to Mr. 
Igpuara to whom the note was delivered by me. At that time my policy had been 
canceled, but later on I was given another physical examination and my policy 
was renewed. Later, by agreement with Mr. Igpuara and the defendant, I advanced 
the difference between the amount of the promissory note already given and the 
amount of the premium due on my policy in payment of my premium. I received a 
letter from the Manila office advising me that I could see this defendant about 
my policy instead of seeing Mr. Calvo. When I signed the promissory note for 
P116 I had in mind to help the defendant to make a settlement with the 
company."</p></blockquote>
<p>Giving the accused the benefit of the doubt which arises on a review of the 
whole record, we think he must be acquitted of the crime with which he is 
charged. Upon a strict construction of the terms of his contract, it would seem 
to have been the duty of the accused to turn over to the company, or its duly 
authorized agent, the amount which he is alleged to have improperly retained, 
and await a settlement to be made thereafter of any claims he may have had 
against the company. But if, as a matter of fact, the company was indebted to 
him for commissions on policies secured by him, it would appear that he was 
acting under the express authority of one of the company's general agents in 
retaining the amount of this indebtedness, pending a settlement of his accounts 
with the company. The evidence of the defense on this point is not disputed.</p>
<p>With no evidence before us tending to prove that the accused was not 
justified in relying upon the instructions and authority of the company's agent 
in this regard we do not think that he can be held <em>criminally</em> liable 
for the retention of any amount which, in good faith, he believed the company 
was indebted to him.</p>
<p>The real question for determination in this case is, therefore, whether the 
accused, in good faith, believed the company to be indebted to him in the amount 
which it is charged and admitted he collected and failed to turn over. Upon this 
point we are of opinion that the evidence is not sufficiently conclusive to 
sustain a finding beyond a reasonable doubt. It is quite evident that there were 
differences between the accused and the company's local and general agents as to 
whom the commissions on various policies should be paid; and giving the accused 
the benefit of the doubt, we do not think that the evidence of record is 
sufficient to maintain a finding that his claim of indebtedness against the 
company was not made in good faith, in the honest belief that he was entitled to 
the commissions claimed by him.</p>
<p>The judgment of conviction and the sentence imposed by the trial court should 
therefore be reversed and the accused acquitted of the offense with which he is 
charged, with the costs in both instances <em>de officio.</em> So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Moreland</em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em>Trent, J.,</em> dissents.</p>
