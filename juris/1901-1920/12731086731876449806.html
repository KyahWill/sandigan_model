				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This was an action&nbsp; commenced in the Court of&nbsp; First Instance&nbsp; of the city of Manila, by the plaintiffs against the defendants, to recover damages caused&nbsp; to the lorcha Marte by the&nbsp; defendants&nbsp; on&nbsp; or about the 15th&nbsp; of April, 1908.<br><br>After hearing the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause, the lower court&nbsp; rendered the following decision:<br><blockquote>"The following facts were proved at trial:<br><br>"1.&nbsp; Messrs. Macondray &amp; Co., one of the business&nbsp; firms of this city, as agents at this port of the steamer <i>Muncaster Castle</i>, having to unload from the said vessel, which had come from New York and was&nbsp; anchored in Cavite Bay, a case&nbsp; of machinery&nbsp; weighing 25&nbsp; tons, consigned&nbsp; to&nbsp; The Manila Electric Railroad and Light Company, accepted the offer of the <i>lorcha Marte,</i>&nbsp; made to them by the plaintiffs, Rocha &amp; Co., a mercantile&nbsp; copartnership company, also of this city,&nbsp; and owned by the latter, in&nbsp; order&nbsp; that the said case of machinery might be unloaded onto the lorcha and transported from Cavite Bay to this port.<br><br>"2. Between 4 and 5 o'clock of the afternoon&nbsp; of the 14th of April,&nbsp; 1908 - that is, three days&nbsp; after Messrs.&nbsp; Macondray &amp; Co. received&nbsp; the offer made by Rocha &amp; Co. of the l<i>orcha Marte</i> - and while&nbsp; proceeding&nbsp; with the operation of transferring the said case of machinery from the&nbsp; hold of the vessel before mentioned&nbsp; to the deck of the <i>lorcha Marte,</i> using for this purpose the said vessel's&nbsp; main mast and spar,&nbsp; the latter attached to&nbsp; the former like a derrick, and while the said case was suspended above the starboard side of the <i>lorcha</i> at a height of from&nbsp; 18 inches to 2&nbsp; feet, the pulleys or links&nbsp; of the chain or cable which&nbsp; fastened the said mast broke, causing the latter, with&nbsp; the&nbsp; spar, to lean toward the side where the case was&nbsp; and to break, letting the case fall onto that part of the said craft - that is, the starboard side - the. fall at the&nbsp; same time&nbsp; causing the <i>lorcha</i>&nbsp; to incline to that side, with&nbsp; danger of the case going into&nbsp; the water.<br><br>"3, To avoid this, and also to save the<i> lorcha</i> from the danger it was in, as it had begun to leak in consequence of the blow&nbsp; it received from the "fall&nbsp; of the&nbsp; case,&nbsp; and&nbsp; on account of its&nbsp; being&nbsp; somewhat under&nbsp; water on the said starboard&nbsp; side, they&nbsp; proceeded, under&nbsp; the&nbsp; orders of the captain of the steamer, to fasten both the&nbsp; case and the <i>lorcha </i>to the side of the vessel by means of ropes and wire cables, the&nbsp; case remaining there in that condition until the following day, when it was extracted, by means of a large floating crane, by The Manila Electric Railroad and Light Company, the consignee of the said&nbsp; case, and transported to this port of Manila in another vessel.<br><br>"4. Macondray &amp; Co. not having adopted any determination whatever with respect to the <i>lorcha</i>, notwithstanding that they were notified of the accident by Rocha &amp; Co.,&nbsp; it remained fastened, by means of ropes and cables as before stated, to the side of&nbsp; the <i>Muncaster Castle,</i> though sunken to the level of the sea on account of leakage and the&nbsp; damage consequent upon the loss of the hatches, until the morning of the 19th of April - that is, for five days after the accident occurred - when the said Rocha &amp; Co.&nbsp; proceeded to salve the said <i>lorcha</i> and to remove it to a shipyard of this city where&nbsp; repairs were made thereto, the cost of which, added to the&nbsp; expenses of salvage and the losses in&nbsp; the&nbsp; collection of freight&nbsp; charges from&nbsp; the&nbsp; 14th to the 30th.&nbsp; of April, amounted to the total&nbsp; sum of P2,493, according to the document, Exhibit A, which accompanied the complaint.<br><br>"Rocha &amp; Co. alleged in the fifth paragraph of their said complaint that the cause of the breaking of the cables and the main&nbsp; mast, which&nbsp; constituted the&nbsp; apparatus&nbsp; for the raising and discharge&nbsp; of the case, was the latter's enormous weight of 27 tons, a&nbsp; weight heavier than&nbsp; the main mast and the cables could support and resist on account of their condition, the insufficiency of the said vessel's&nbsp; unloading apparatus, and the failure on the. part of the&nbsp; captain and the employees and crew under his orders to&nbsp; adopt any measures or means which ordinary prudence counseled to previously make sure of the sufficiency, resistance, and good condition of the apparatus employed to perform the operation effected without the probability of the&nbsp; occurrence&nbsp; of the accident which&nbsp; happened.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; plaintiffs,&nbsp; therefore,&nbsp; prayed&nbsp; that judgment be rendered against the defendants for the&nbsp; said sum of P2,493, as an indemnity for losses and&nbsp; damages, with interest and costs.<br><br>"From&nbsp; the evidence adduced, however, it was proved that the operation of unloading the&nbsp; said case, or of its&nbsp; transportation&nbsp; from&nbsp; the steamer <i>Muncaster Castle</i> to the deck of the <i>lorcha Marte</i>, was performed under the supervision of the&nbsp; captain&nbsp; of the&nbsp; steamer, Percy&nbsp; Watson, and of a stevedore, a representative&nbsp; of William&nbsp; Sherman,&nbsp; after&nbsp; the said stevedore had tested the apparatus by means of which the said case&nbsp; was&nbsp; removed&nbsp; from the hold of the&nbsp; aforesaid vessel&nbsp; without any difficulty or mishap whatever.&nbsp; There is absolutely&nbsp; no proof that the said&nbsp; operation&nbsp; was conducted&nbsp; in an inappropriate manner or that&nbsp; means were employed&nbsp; which could have resulted in the accident.<br><br>"On the&nbsp; contrary,&nbsp; it&nbsp; was&nbsp; shown by the testimony of Captain Watson himself, not rebutted at the trial by the plaintiff's&nbsp; counsel,&nbsp; that,&nbsp; although both&nbsp; in loading and unloading cargo of&nbsp; that&nbsp; weight they had sometimes used, especially&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; port&nbsp; of&nbsp; New York,&nbsp; floating cranes or derricks, because of their having a contract for this purpose, the employment of other means&nbsp; being considered harmful, nevertheless they had&nbsp; often used for such&nbsp; operations the spar or yard and the mast, even for larger weights; that in Japan they unloaded by this means two locomotives,&nbsp; whose boilers weighed 28 tons, and also in Manila Bay, three days before the accident, cast-iron cannons and boilers weighing 28 and&nbsp; 22 tons,&nbsp; respectively, with the&nbsp; sole difference that this freight was unloaded from the port side of the vessel, while the case in question was taken off from the starboard side.<br><br>"The&nbsp; record&nbsp; likewise shows,&nbsp; by the testimony&nbsp; given by Captain Watson, with no evidence&nbsp; whatever to&nbsp; the contrary, that he&nbsp; made sure,&nbsp; before attempting to unload, that the mast and the cables were able to resist the weight of the 27-ton case.&nbsp;&nbsp; This same witness moreover testified that the pulleys and&nbsp; cogwheels, and&nbsp; the wires of the said apparatus, had&nbsp; been thoroughly tested&nbsp; and could bear a weight of 50 tons; that he had a certificate from the Government which stated that the&nbsp; said&nbsp; apparatus could support such a weight,&nbsp; although, he added,&nbsp; he&nbsp; could&nbsp; not be held responsible for any&nbsp; defects which&nbsp; afterwards&nbsp; might&nbsp; be found and were not visible in the apparatus mentioned or which existed inside of the mast at the time of its construction.&nbsp; This mast was made entirely of steel.<br><br>"It is true that the stevedore, William Sherman, a witness for the defendants, who arrived at the steamer <i>Muncaster Castle</i>&nbsp; one hour and&nbsp; fifteen minutes after the accident,&nbsp; for he had his representative, Mr. Farris,&nbsp; there when the said operation of unloading was performed, testified at the trial that he thought that they&nbsp; intended&nbsp; to put into the said apparatus&nbsp; a load of greater weight than the mast could&nbsp; resist, giving it to be understood by this, perhaps, that&nbsp; it was&nbsp; due to this&nbsp; excess in weight of&nbsp; the load that&nbsp; the mast&nbsp; broke.&nbsp; It is also&nbsp; true that Tomas Felipe, a witness for the plaintiffs and&nbsp; customs inspector who was on the vessel Muncaster Castle at the time and was present at the accident,&nbsp; in referring to the unloading of four cannons&nbsp; in Manila Bay by means of the same mast and&nbsp; spar&nbsp; that&nbsp; is, the identical cannons referred to by Captain Watson of the said&nbsp; steamer - testified&nbsp; that on the occasion&nbsp; mentioned the load lowered 2 inches because of the lowering of the ring which held the derrick.<br><br>"But it is to be borne in mind that the testimony of this second witness,&nbsp; Tomas Felipe,&nbsp; has&nbsp; but&nbsp; little or&nbsp; no importance in the&nbsp; present case to enable a conclusion to be drawn therefrom&nbsp; that&nbsp; the mast, the spar, or any&nbsp; of the component parts of the said unloading apparatus was&nbsp; in bad condition, inasmuch&nbsp; as such testimony is&nbsp; incredible, for in the matter of a load such as is inferred from a bulk like that of a&nbsp; cannon of 22 tons in weight it is not&nbsp; understood how nor why the said witness could have&nbsp; observed that the load&nbsp; had lowered so&nbsp; small a&nbsp; space as that of 2 inches, a space imperceptible and inestimable, particularly if we consider the movements&nbsp; made in operations of that kind; but be that&nbsp; as it may, such a statement made by a person who is not, like this witness, an expert, and without being in any&nbsp; manner corroborated at the trial,&nbsp; can not serve as a foundation whereupon to conclude with certainty that such a defect&nbsp; did exist&nbsp; in the apparatus,&nbsp; and consequently,&nbsp; that&nbsp; there was negligence&nbsp; or&nbsp; carelessness&nbsp; on the&nbsp; part of the captain&nbsp; of the <i>Muncaster Castle</i> by his again employing the said apparatus for the unloading of the case in question, several days afterwards, without taking such defect into account, or without having corrected it.<br><br>"With respect to the&nbsp; opinion expressed by the stevedore Sherman, a person of expert knowledge in this matter,&nbsp; it is to be taken into account that the original and&nbsp; primary cause of the accident was the breaking of two pulleys which held the mast fast, to which&nbsp; was attached the&nbsp; spar,&nbsp; as Captain&nbsp; Watson testified, and&nbsp; this&nbsp; was also given to&nbsp; be understood by the very witness of the plaintiffs, Tomas Felipe, in testifying that&nbsp; on that occasion, while&nbsp; the case was hoisted to the side of the ship, one of the rings burst and&nbsp; the mast&nbsp; buckled or bent downwards.&nbsp; The stevedore Farris testified that&nbsp; 'before the case could be put&nbsp; into a good position&nbsp; to let it fall or&nbsp; to place it upon the <i>lorcha,</i> two&nbsp; links of the chain&nbsp; and an eyebolt&nbsp; broke, leaving the mast without&nbsp; any&nbsp; support,&nbsp; for they followed&nbsp; the ropes,' the result being, according to this same&nbsp; witness, that, with the rising and falling of the <i>lorcha </i>and the case, due to the movement of the sea, the mast followed the same motion and&nbsp; fell.&nbsp;&nbsp; This witness Farris&nbsp; added that, in his&nbsp; opinion, there must have been some invisible defect in the manufacture of the bolts, the nut, and the links of the chain.<br><br>"The original and primary cause of the accident, then, did not consist in the breaking of the mast, but in the breaking of two pulleys or two links and an eyebolt of the chain sustaining the mast, which&nbsp; caused the spar&nbsp; and the mast to&nbsp; be drawn downwards by the weight of the case, and the mast, left without support on account of the breakage of the said pulteys or links, also broke.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is therefore evident that no consideration can be given to the opinion expressed by the stevedore, Mr. Sherman, with respect to the small resisting power of the mast to carry a weight heavier than it could support, an opinion given in order to lead to the conclusion that tfce accident was due to the breaking of the&nbsp; mast in question,&nbsp; because of its&nbsp; being unable to resist so heavy a weight as that of the 25-ton case; and it is perfectly well understood&nbsp; that&nbsp; such&nbsp; a deduction&nbsp; can&nbsp; not&nbsp; be&nbsp; reached, because,&nbsp; in the case under consideration, if the two pulleys of the mast, as Captain Watson testified, or the two links and an eyebolt of the chain,&nbsp; according to Stevedore Farris's testimony, had not broken, it is obvious that the mast would not have broken, because the said chain or eyebolt was what sustained the mast which, left without&nbsp; support, due to the weight of the case, necessarily had to break, as it could not maintain&nbsp; itself in a&nbsp; position perpendicular to the ship's deck.<br><br>"Briefly, the logical and reasonable conclusion to be drawn from the facts hereinbefore related, in connection with the fact of the said mast and spar having been&nbsp; used by&nbsp; Captain Watson&nbsp; on other occasions&nbsp; and three days before&nbsp; for the unloading of effects&nbsp; of equal weight,&nbsp; and&nbsp; sometimes of greater&nbsp; weight than that of the case&nbsp; of machinery mentioned, without any difficulty or mishap whatever, is&nbsp; that the mast and the spar and all of that apparatus for unloading, used in the removal of the said case from the steamer to the <i>lorcha,</i> had no defect whatever) was suitable for the purpose, and that there was no imprudence, carelessness, negligence, nor omission whatever on the part of&nbsp; Captain Watson in his having&nbsp; used&nbsp; on the said occasion&nbsp; the&nbsp; apparatus referred to, and that the damage resulting from the accident&nbsp; was caused by a merely fortuitous event,&nbsp; for which neither the captain of the vessel nor the other defendants can be held responsible.<br><br>"Moreover, from the evidence adduced, it was also shown that, although the <i>lorcha Marte</i> had a tonnage of 67 tons, net weight, and could&nbsp; carry&nbsp; from 70 to&nbsp; 75 tons, haying received, one or two days before the accident, a load of 67 tons of&nbsp; oil in barrels or jars,&nbsp; notwithstanding&nbsp; it was not designed to carry on deck in a fixed&nbsp; place - that is, in a single mass - a case like the&nbsp; one&nbsp; in&nbsp; question,&nbsp; of 25 tons weight whose dimensions were, approximately, 24 feet in length, 12 or&nbsp; 14 feet in width, and&nbsp; 8 feet in height, because the&nbsp; said <i>lorcha </i>had a round&nbsp; bottom and was of the type of boat used for&nbsp; receiving cargo in its&nbsp; hold, and not on&nbsp; its deck, which was not flat, but had hatches, which made it impossible or difficult to place the&nbsp; case on the deck; moreover, as the craft was not then carrying ballast, even though the case&nbsp; had been placed in the center of the deck, the <i>lorcha </i>would not&nbsp; have&nbsp; had the&nbsp; necessary stability to&nbsp; maintain itself in a&nbsp; horizontal position, it&nbsp; being due to this, and especially to the fact of&nbsp; its having a round bottom, that it inclined to one side in the manner aforestated when the case gravitated toward&nbsp; the prow on its starboard side until it became necessary for the <i>lorcha</i> to be made fast to the <i> Muncaster Castle</i>, as before related.<br><br>"Now, then, the said <i>lorcha </i>was offered by the plaintiffs to Macondray&nbsp; &amp;&nbsp; Co., they,&nbsp; the plaintiffs,&nbsp; knowing, as indeed they must have known, the condition of the same, and knowing that it was intended to load therein the said 25-ton case, as shown by&nbsp; the letter,&nbsp; Exhibit 4, addressed on the 11th of April to the said Macondray &amp; Co. by the plaintiffs; so that the failure of that operation is partly due and must be attributed&nbsp; to the latter themselves,&nbsp; for the fact&nbsp; of the <i>lorcha</i> not being in suitable condition when it was placed&nbsp; at the disposal of the captain of the steamer alongside his vessel for the purpose of receiving the load contributed to the&nbsp; accident,&nbsp; since, as is&nbsp; easily understood from the explanations made by some of the defendants' witnesses, if the said craft had been sufficiently ballasted it, with the weight upon it, would not have listed so much toward the side where the case lay, and if it had had a flat deck and no hatches, it would&nbsp; have been easier to place&nbsp; the case on&nbsp; the&nbsp; deck than to have placed it in the hold.<br><br>"Although the case had&nbsp; so great a weight as that of 25 tons and&nbsp; although&nbsp; it be admitted that, on&nbsp; the bending or leaning of the mast and the spar by the&nbsp; breaking of the pulleys, the case fell onto the deck with the full impulse of its weight a distance of from 18 inches to 2&nbsp; feet, the blow could not have been of such a nature as to have caused so much&nbsp; damage to the craft as was noted when&nbsp; it was placed in&nbsp; the shipyard for repairs.<br><br>"It is understood, of course, that as an immediate result of such a blow the <i>lorcha</i> may have started to leak, and that, inclined on its starboard side, on account of the gravitation of the case&nbsp; in that direction, water must have entered its hold, but, as is deduced from the testimony of the captain of the steamer and from that of other witnesses of the defendants, the water could have been baled out so as to prevent the&nbsp; craft&nbsp; from submerging,&nbsp; and,&nbsp; with less&nbsp; indolence and inactivity on the part of the crew, the loss of the hatches and other parts of the upper works would have been avoided.<br><br>"At all events,&nbsp; it was&nbsp; proved that the&nbsp; captain&nbsp; of&nbsp; the steamer adopted the necessary measures to secure the <i>lorcha</i> to the side of the vessel in such manner as to prevent its total loss&nbsp; and to enable the case to be removed from it, by means of a floating derrick, and brought&nbsp; ashore by the Manila Electric Railroad&nbsp; and Light&nbsp; Company, the&nbsp; <i>lorcha</i> from that moment, being freed from the weight which was bearing down upon it, it was possible to remove&nbsp; the boat from its place alongside the ship and take it to the shipyard for repairs.<br><br>"This, however, was not done until four days afterwards, that&nbsp; is, on the 19th, the <i>lorcha </i>having been&nbsp; during all&nbsp; that time attached to&nbsp; the&nbsp; steamer by cables and&nbsp; almost&nbsp; submerged, which,&nbsp; together&nbsp; with the&nbsp; blows it must have received from the vessel itself, on account of the movement of the waves, necessarily produced, in its upper works and also within, much damage that would not have been caused if the <i>lorcha</i> had been removed from that place and taken to the shipyard the day following the accident.<br><br>"As neither the captain of the steamer nor Macondray &amp; Co. were responsible for the said removal and conveyance, as aforesaid, it devolved upon the plaintiffs to perform those operations which in fact they did five days afterwards, and therefore the latter themselves must suffer the consequences of their lack of diligence, and because the <i>lorcha</i> was not released from the said situation as soon as the case&nbsp; was extracted, which prevented the release of the craft, the latter received greater damage than was the immediate and direct result of the fall of the heavy case upon it.<br><br>"Lastly, it was not proved that the captain of the <i>Muncaster Castle</i> failed to render the required aid in order to keep the <i>lorcha</i>&nbsp; in such&nbsp; condition that the plaintiffs could remove it from its position at the side of the steamer and convey it to the shipyard, and it is unlikely, and can not be deemed as proved, that he prevented the <i>lorcha'</i>s crew from picking up&nbsp; the&nbsp; hatches and&nbsp; other&nbsp; appurtenances of the injured craft which were floating about on the sea, or from executing any other act for the salvage of the said <i>lorcha,</i> and&nbsp; it is much less probable that the first officer of the said steamer compelled the said crew to throw the hatches overboard, as stated by the master of the <i>lorcha,</i> Zacarias Labrador, in his testimony given at the trial, the&nbsp; testimony of Hilario Tan Toco, the man in charge or representative on the lorcha of Rocha &amp; Co., being more likely and credible, to the effect that he ordered the crew to gather up the hatches and that then one of the officers of the <i>Muncaster Castle</i> also ordered his crew to gather them up, a part of them being placed on the <i>lorcha</i> and&nbsp; a part on the steamer; and it was also&nbsp; shown, by the testimony of Tomas Felipe, the customs inspector who was present at the time on the <i>Muncaster Castle,</i> that the crew of the <i>lorcha </i>did nothing toward gathering up the hatches; from all of which it must be concluded that it was necessary for Hilario Tan Toco,&nbsp; Rocha &amp; Co/s man in charge, to order the <i>lorcha</i>'s crew to gather up the hatches in order to have them do so, and this is sufficient to conclude that the said&nbsp; crew did nothing by themselves, and were not disposed to do&nbsp; anything&nbsp; on their&nbsp; own initiative for the salvage of the craft and to avoid greater&nbsp; damage being done thereto during the period of time that elapsed from the moment the accident occurred on&nbsp; the&nbsp; afternoon of the 14th until the morning of the 19th, when the plaintiffs proceeded to salve the said craft and convey it to a shipyard in this city; and it is unquestionable that, during those five days, the&nbsp; said plaintiffs&nbsp; could have done a good&nbsp; deal&nbsp; to prevent an increase&nbsp; of the losses and damages suffered by the <i>lorcha</i>, without the necessity of&nbsp; orders being given&nbsp; for that purpose by the captain&nbsp; and officers of the <i>Muncaster Castle,</i> and they also could have gathered up the said hatches, if it were true that they had been&nbsp; put on a lighter or in the bow of the steamer by order of the first officer, as&nbsp; the master of the&nbsp; <i>lorcha</i> testified.<br><br>"In conclusion, the testimony of&nbsp; the&nbsp; said master and of Arturo&nbsp; Blanco,&nbsp; the inspector of vessels, introduced in&nbsp; rebuttal by the plaintiffs to prove&nbsp; that the stevedore, Farris, was not on board the <i>Muncaster Castle</i> when the accident occurred,&nbsp; but arrived some moments&nbsp; afterwards,&nbsp; is not worthy of belief, because, besides&nbsp; the fact of these two witnesses being employees of the plaintiffs themselves, their testimony is contradictory to that given by the captain&nbsp; of the steamer, H. P. Winkler,&nbsp; a witness for the defendants, who mentioned Mr. Farris as one of those who was present at the time on the said steamer, and the testimony of Farris himself, considered in connection with the statements made by the other witnesses who were present during the accident, prove that he also was present.&nbsp; It is, moreover, strange, and can not but attract our attention, that Arturo&nbsp; Blanco, being aboard the Muncaster Castle that afternoon, according to his own testimony, when Farris,&nbsp; as he testified,&nbsp; arrived in a launch from Canacao, and Zacarias Labrador being at that same time, according to his own testimony, not on the steamer,&nbsp; but on the sea, these two,&nbsp; Farris and&nbsp; Labrador, should have testified that Farris arrived ten minutes after the accident - a uniformity&nbsp; of statements which makes the testimony of both of these witnesses suspicious, and so much the more that, in&nbsp; order to&nbsp; prove that point,&nbsp; the plaintiffs could have availed themselves of the testimony&nbsp; of&nbsp; Tomas Felipe himself, one of their witnesses, and that of the other persons who were aboard the steamer on that occasion.<br><br>"By virtue of the foregoing reasons,&nbsp; the court absolves the defendants, with the costs against&nbsp; the plaintiffs.&nbsp; So ordered.&nbsp; Manila,&nbsp; August 30,&nbsp; 1909. -&nbsp; (Sgd.) Manuel Araullo, judge."</blockquote>From&nbsp; this judgment the plaintiff appealed&nbsp; and&nbsp; made three assignments&nbsp; of&nbsp; error in this court.&nbsp; These assignments of error&nbsp; present questions of fact&nbsp; only.<br><br>From&nbsp; an examination of the evidence brought to this court, we are of the&nbsp; opinion&nbsp; and so hold that there is a clear preponderance of evidence in&nbsp; favor&nbsp; of the&nbsp; finding of the lower court.&nbsp; Its sentence and judgment are, therefore, hereby affirmed, with costs.<br><br>After&nbsp; the bill of exceptions and the briefs of the&nbsp; respective&nbsp; parties had been filed&nbsp; in&nbsp; this&nbsp; court and after a request had been made to place the same upon the calendar of the July term, Mr.&nbsp; Carlos Young,&nbsp; on the&nbsp; 17th of May, 1910, presented a motion praying for the dismissal&nbsp; of the appeal, claiming to have purchased all&nbsp; of the interest of the plaintiff and appellant involved in this cause.&nbsp; Before this motion was acted upon, Mr. Carlos Young presented another motion on&nbsp; the&nbsp; 8th&nbsp; of July,&nbsp; 1910, asking that he be substituted for&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff and appellant.&nbsp; These motions were opposed by the attorneys for the original plaintiff and appellant.<br><br>On the 12th&nbsp; of July, 1910, the&nbsp; court acted upon said motions and granted the one&nbsp; asking for the substitution of Carlos Young for the plaintiff and&nbsp; appellant, but denied the one asking for the dismissal of the appeal.<br><br>On the 16th of July, 1910, Mr. Carlos&nbsp; Young, through his attorney, presented another motion asking permission to withdraw his motion of the 8th of July, which motion was duly granted.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is so ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano, C.
