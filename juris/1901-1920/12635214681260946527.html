				<h4>
				G.R. No. 1479, April 16, 1904</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE, VS. VICTORINA DE LOS SANTOS, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The court below having declared that the accused was guilty of the
crime, the defense in this appeal has endeavored to show that she acted
in self-defense. But the only witness that the accused presented for
the purpose of proving the assault, which she imputes to her brother,
Valentin de los Santos, did not testify to the fact that he had struck
his sister with a cane, which is what she alleges to be the aggression.
The witness has only testified to threatening words.
<p>Therefore the judgment of the. court below, being in accordance with
law, is affirmed with the costs of this instance to the appellant. So
ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Mapa, McDonough,</em> and <em>Johnson, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
