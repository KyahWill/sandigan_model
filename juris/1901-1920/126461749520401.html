				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is a motion to dismiss the bill of exceptions.   Judgment was rendered for the defendants, on May 1, 1903. The plaintiffs were  notified thereof on May 21.  On May 28 they excepted to  the judgment and presented a  motion for a new trial.   This motion was denied on July 23.  On July 28 the plaintiffs presented their proposed  bill of exceptions which, on  August 5, was allowed and  signed by the court.  The  term of the court at which the case was tried expired on May 30.</p>
<ol>
  <li> The first  ground of the motion  is, that  the  bill of exceptions was allowed after the time therefor had expired. Section 143 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that the defeated party shall notify the judge before the  ending of the term that lie  "desires to  prosecute a bill of exceptions."   It is alleged by the appellees that such notice was not given in this case.  No evidence was presented, however, at  the hearing to prove this allegation.   In the absence of such evidence, we can not presume  that  it was not done.  The presumption would rather be to tmf contrary.  And, in this case,  it  is  strengthened  by the fact that, when the appellees were notified of the presentation of the bill of exceptions on July 28, they made no objection to it on this ground,  and by the further fact that the court allowed  it  on  August 5 without suggesting  that such allowance was improper for the  reason stated.</li>
</ol>
<p>Within ten days after the notification above mentioned said section 143 requires the  appellant to present  to  the judge his proposed bill of exceptions.  There  is nothing in the section  which  requires that this  should be done during the term at which the case was tried.   If the  ten days should expire after the  expiration of the  term,  the appellant would nevertheless have the undoubted right to present his proposed bill on  the tenth day.  It appears, however, that in this case the bill of exceptions "was not presented for more than six weeks after the term ended and, therefore, long after the  expiration of ten days from the notification, assuming that such notice was given during the term.   It is said that  this term of ten days is not an extendible one, and that a bill of exceptions must in all cases be presented within that period.  It' appears that, while the motion for a new trial was made on  May 23, it was not decided until July 21, and the appellant  claims that, as he must necessarily insert in his bill of exceptions his exception to the order denying the motion for  a new trial, the ten days did not commence to  run  until such order was made.  There is force in this suggestion, but we do not find it necessary to decide the question.</p>
<p>The part of the  section in question is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The party desiring to prosecute  the bill of  exceptions shall  so inform the court at the time of the rendition of final judgment, or as soon thereafter as may be practicable and before the ending of the  term of the  court at  which final judgment is  rendered, and the judge shall enter a memorandum to that effect upon his minutes and order a like memorandum to be made by the clerk upon the docket of the court, among the other entries relating to the action. Within ten days after the entry of the memorandum aforesaid, the excepting party shall cause to  be presented to the judge a brief statement of the facts of the case sufficient to show the bearing of the rulings,  orders, or judgments excepted to, and a  specific statement of each ruling,  order, or judgment that has been excepted to, for allowance  by the judge.   The judge shall thereupon, after reasonable notice to both parties and within five days from the presentation of the bill of exceptions to him, restate the facts if need be.   *   *  *"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The  question is one of construction.   Did  the Commission intend to say that the  parties might consent to or the judge order an extension  of this period of ten days, or did they intend to  have it  read  is if there had been inserted after the words "allowance  by  the judge" the following clause: "And the judge shall have no power for any cause whatever to extend this period of ten days, and any agreement of the parties to that effect shall be void?" It will be noticed that this period of ten days, as well as the  subsequent period of five days,  has to do with what may be called the  mechanical part  of the  appeal,  the preparation of the papers for transmission to, the Supreme Court.  The rights of the parties as to the removal itself have already been fixed  by the notice of the intention to prepare a bill of  exceptions, which notice must be entered of record in  the  clerk's office.  If the period for the performance of  that act corresponds to the time for appeal, or for suing  out  a writ of error found in most other laws of American origin, it of course can not be extended by order of court or consent of parties.  But that period is entirely distinct  from this period of ten days allowed for preparing the papers, after the right  to remove the case has  been  secured.  It can not, therefore, be said that an extension of this time is an extension of the time to appeal.</p>
<p>When we take into consideration the condition of things  in the Archipelago at the time this law was adopted, it seems impossible to believe that the Commission intended to deprive the court and the parties of the power to extend this term. They must have known that in many cases it would be  a physical impossibility to comply with it.  In a case tried in Zambales, it might easily happen that the judge would close his term of court and depart for the Province  of Union or Benguet during the running of the ten days,  where it would be impossible for the  appellant to reach him within that period.   In fact, in view of the lack of means of easy and frequent  communication  between different parts of the Islands, a departure of a judge from one province to another, almost  anywhere in the Archipelago  except  upon  the line  of railroad  between Manila  and Dagupan, would  make it impossible for the appellant  to  reach him within ten days.   In addition to this, even  in Manila, it would probably happen, in a majority of cases,  that the stenographer would not be able to furnish the appellant a transcript of his notes within ten days, or that the appellant would be unable to prepare the bill within that time.</p>
<p>And, besides all  this, there is no apparent reason why the parties should not have a  right to agree that these papers might be presented in twenty days instead of ten. No one is interested except themselves, and no question of public policy is involved.   We  hold, therefore, that this period of ten days is not nonextendible and that it can be extended by  the order of the court or the consent of the parties.</p>
<p>In this case the judge did not, by an order made before the expiration of  the ten  days, extend the time.  But statutes frequently  confer upon courts the power to permit certain acts to be done after the time prescribed therefor has expired.  There is the same reason for holding in this case that such power  has been conferred as for  holding that the statute gives the  court power to enlarge the time. There would, in many cases, exist the same physical impossibility of securing such  an order from the judge as  in presenting to him  the bill of exceptions.  The judge,  by signing the bill of exceptions, on August 5, consented that the time should be extended.  It moreover was stated  in the written document presented by the appellant at the hearing, and  not denied by the appellee, that the proposed bill of exceptions was served upon the appellee on July 28, and that he made no objection to its being allowed.   This was a  waiver by him of  the objection that it had been presented too late.</p>
<p>Authorities holding that orders  of this kind must  be made within the term have no bearing on this case, because, (1) as  we have  seen, this  act  of  presenting the  bill  of exceptions need not be done within the term, and  (2) the theory of the common law of England, that the court could only act within a term, has been entirely abolished by the provisions of section 53 of Act No. 136, which provides that "Courts of First Instance shall be always open, legal holidays and  nonjudicial days excepted."  At the common law, nothing can be done outside of the term unless the statute  authorizes  it.  Under our  law anything  can  be done outside  of the term unless  the statute prohibits it.</p>
<ol start="2">
  <li> The appellees asked,  also, that the bill of exceptions be dismissed  because it did not contain all  the evidence received at the trial.   This allegation they proved  by a certificate  from the clerk of the court below.   It appears, however, that  the plaintiffs excepted to the  judgment. This, under  the repeated  rulings  of  this court,  enabled them to argue here the question as  to whether the findings of fact stated by the judge in his decision, with the  facts admitted by the pleadings, support the judgment which has been ordered.  For the purposes  of such exception, it was neither necessary nor  proper to  incorporate the evidence into the bill of  exceptions.   There being enough  in the record to  present this question,  the appeal can not  be dismissed on this ground.   It appears, however, that the question whirl)  the appellants chiefly desire to present is whether or not  the findings of fact are supported  by the evidence.   As said by counsel for appellees in his argument here, this court  can  not  determine this question unless it has before it. what the court below  had before it when the decision was rendered.  It must appear from the bill of exceptions, in some way, that it contains all the evidence bearing upon  the  point in dispute.   The appellants say that  when they prepared the bill of exceptions they included therein all the evidence then in the record, and, by a certificate of the  clerk  of the court below,  they proved  that  the testimony  of  the  witnesses, claimed by the appellees to be wanting, was delivered to said clerk on the 25th day of September by one of the lawyers for the appellees.</li>
</ol>
<p>We can not agree with counsel for the appellant in his claim that it was the duty of the appellees to have objected, on this ground,  to the bill of exceptions before it  was signed.  Such would have been their duty had there  been in the proposed bill a  statement  that  it contained all the evidence.   In the absence of such a statement, they  were not bound  to presume that the appellants proposed  to pursue both their exception to the judgment and also their exception to the order denying their motion for a new trial.</p>
<p>At the argument of  this motion  the appellant's lawyer did state that such was his intention.  To enable this  to be done it  will  be necessary to correct the record.   Our power  to do  this  is ample.  Section 500 of the Code  of Civil  Procedure provides: "But  no such dismissal shaH be made for purely formal defects not affecting the rights of the parties, nor for any defect which can be removed, and the Supreme  Court shall give such reasonable time as may be necessary  to remove such defect, if it can be removed.   *  *  * Nor shall such dismissal be granted where, by an amendment to the bill of exceptions, which is hereby declared  to be lawful and allowable, and  imperfections or omissions  of necessary and proper allegations could  be corrected from the record in the case."</p>
<p>Section 501 is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"<em>Incomplete record, how corrected</em>.—If at any time when a case is called for  trial, or during the trial, or afterwards, while  the Supreme Court may have the same under consideration, it is discovered that the record is so incomplete that justice requires  the  case to be postponed until the record can be made complete, the court shall postpone the further consideration of the same  and make such order as may be proper  and necessary to complete the record, in  the interests of  justice.   But the court  may dismiss a bill of exceptions for failure of the excepting party within a reasonable time to comply with the orders made for the perfection of the bill of exceptions."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under these sections, the appellants have  the  right to complete  the record by having incorporated into the bill of  exceptions that part of the evidence which has been omitted.</p>
<p>The motion of the appellees to dismiss the bill of exceptions is denied.   The appellants are hereby allowed thirty days, from the date of this order, in which to file in this court a certified copy of all the evidence received at the trial of said cause which  is not already embodied in the bill of exceptions, with a certificate from the judge  of the court below  that said additional  evidence, together with the evidence already contained in the bill of exceptions, is all  the evidence received at the trial of said cause. Upon the  receipt of said copies, the clerk shall cause them to be printed at the expense of the appellants, distributed to the parties, and attached to the printed record.  The time  for  tlie  presentation of the appellant's brief  shall comiiiwive to run from the term of such distribution.</p>

  DISSENTING
</div>
<p><strong>JOHNSON, J.,</strong> with whom concurs <strong>COOPER, J.:</strong></p>
<p>In  this case judgment was rendered  on  the 1st day of May,  1903.  The appellant was given notice of  the judgment on the 21st day of May.  On the 23d day of May the appellant moved for a new trial.  The term of the court expired  on the 5th day of June.  The judge denied the motion for a new  trial on the  23d  day of July.  On the 28th day  of July the appellant presented his bill of exceptions.  On the 5th day of August the judge signed said bill of exceptions.</p>
<p>On the 30th day of September, 1903, the appellee made a  motion in this court asking that  the said bill  of exceptions be dismissed, among others, for the following reasons, to wit:</p>
<ol>
  <li> That the  appellant had not informed the court, before the ending  of the   term  at  which final judgment was rendered, "of his desire to prosecute a bill of exceptions."<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> That the bill  of  exceptions was presented to and allowed by  the trial judge after the time fixed by the statute had  elapsed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Section 143  of the new Code of Civil Procedure provides how a bill of  exceptions may  be perfected.  It provides <em>the only method of  perfecting an appeal in ordinary civil actions.</em>  Its provisions are as follows :</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The  party  desiring to prosecute a bill of exceptions shall so inform  the court at the time of the rendition of final judgment, or as soon thereafter as may be practicable and <em>before the ending of the term of court  at which final judgment is rendered.</em>  The judge shall  enter a memorandum to that  effect  upon his minutes and order a like memorandum  to be  made upon the docket of the  court among the other entries relating to the action.   Within ten days after  the entry of the memorandum aforesaid, the excepting  party shall cause to be presented to the judge a brief statement of the facts of the  case sufficient to show the bearing  of the rulings, orders  of judgment  excepted to, and a specific statement of each ruling, order, or judgment that has been excepted to, for allowance by the judge. The judge shall thereupon, after reasonable notice to both parties and within five days from the presentation of the bill of exceptions  to him, restate the facts if need be and the exceptions, so that the questions of law therein involved and their relevancy shall all be made clear, and when the bill of exceptions has  been perfected and allowed by the judge, he shall certify  that it  has been so allowed and the bill of exceptions shall be filed with the other papers in the action and the same shall thereupon be  transferred to the Supreme Court for determination of the questions of law involved."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The preceding  four  conditions constitute the  method of perfecting an appeal from the judgment of the Court of First Instance  to the  Supreme  Court in ordinary  civil actions.   Each of these steps or  provisions must be complied with in  order to perfect the appeal.  The bill  of exceptions, when  completed, must  show on its face  that this statute has been complied with.   No presumption can import a fact  not therein made expressly to appear.</p>
<p>There is no statement or suggestion in the  bill of exceptions presented in the above cause <em>that the appellant at any time  gave the court notice of his desire to prosecute a  bill of  exceptions. </em> It is argued that no evidence was presented at the hearing to prove this allegation, and that in the absence of  such proof we  can  not presume that it was not done.   It  is not the duty of this court to presume either  that  it  was or  was not done.  The record  must answer  the question.   The record fails to show that this notice  was given.  Nothing can  be presumed  which the record does not show.   This  failure on the part of the appellant to give this notice, unless he brings himself under  some  extraordinary circumstance, is  fatal.  No attempt is made here to explain or justify this failure.</p>
<p>Section 143  of the New Code of Civil Procedure provides the method by which the Supreme Court obtains jurisdiction of ordinary civil causes.  No other method is provided for by the code.  The Supreme Court acquires no jurisdiction unless these provisions are complied with.   They are jurisdictional requirements and therefore must appear of record.  None of them can be presumed.  The statute is mandatory in its terms, and the Supreme Court ought not to  take  jurisdiction  of a  cause  unless  there  has  been  a compliance therewith.  Its provisions are plain and easily complied with.</p>
<p>The rule is well settled  both under the decisions of the courts of the United States and of Spain,  that when the time within which a notice of an appeal or an appeal shall be  perfected is fixed by statute, it can not be extended by the court,  and the appellate court obtains no jurisdiction of the cause if these conditions are complied with  beyond the statutory period.  The time within which an  appeal must be taken is fixed bv  section 143 of  the new Code of Civil Procedure, and the appeal must  be  taken  within the time so designated.  The Courts of First Instance have no authority to enlarge the time, nor can the parties extend it by agreement. If the appellant has failed to perfect his appeal within the time fixed by law, it is necessary for him to file a transcript in the  appellate court with a verified petition showing the facts upon which he relies  as excusing his failure  to perfect his appeal within the statutory  period. Upon proper notice to the adverse party the superior court may, under its general equitable powers, grant such relief as  it may  deem wise and proper  under all the  circumstances.  The practice in  such cases varies in different jurisdictions.</p>
<p>These  statutes  limiting the time  to  appeal from the  decision of courts below are mandatory and jurisdictional. (Dooling <em>vs.</em> Moore, 20 Cal., 141.)  Unless an  appeal (or notice of an appeal) is taken within the statutory period, the court has no jurisdiction and the appeal is void  for all purposes and will be dismissed on motion of appellee.  The courts can  not  waive nor extend these  statutory  provisions, except  where the  statute  so expressly  authorizes. (Gardner <em>vs.</em> Ingraham, 82 Ala., 339; Caillot <em>vs.</em> Deetken, 113 U. S., 215; Fitzgerald  <em>vs.</em> Brandt, 36  Nebr., 683.)  If the time to perfect an appeal, as fixed  by the law, is  found, under the  conditions existing in this Archipelago,  to be too short, then it is the duty of the legislature to amend the law.  The courts have no authority to amend the laws. The only reason why  the parties can not extend time is because the law fixes  the  time within which the appeal must be  perfected.  An extension  of the time without authority would be void, and the appeal would be without effect.   (Smith <em>vs.</em> Smith, 48 Mo. App., 618.)   This was the  rule  under  the Spanish  Code  of  Civil Procedure. Article 365 of that code provided that the appeal must be taken in five days.  The courts have repeatedly held, under that article, that this provision was mandatory or improrogable.  Don  Jose  Maria Manresa,  in his commentaries on the Code of Civil Procedure (yol. 2, pp. 164-172), says: "The terms of this article are nonextcndible, and the time runs from the day following the notification."</p>
<p>Inasmuch as section  143 of the new Code of Civil Procedure provides the only method of perfecting an appeal in ordinary civil actions in the Philippines, the decisions of the  courts in  the  United  States on that question are germane.</p>
<p>In the case of Muller vs. Ehlers (91 U. 8., 249), Waite, Chief Justice, said: "It  does not appear that the bill of exceptions was filed, tendered for signature, or  even prepared, before the adjournment of the court for the term at which the judgment was rendered.  <em> No notice teas given to the plaintiff  of any intention on the part of the defendant to ash for the hill of exceptions either during the term or after.</em>  Upon the adjournment of the term, the parties were out of court and  the litigation there was at an end. The  order of the (trial) court, therefore, made at the next term, directing that the  bill of exceptions be filed in the cause as of April 28, 1873 (the date of the judgment), was a nullity.  For this reason  the bill of exceptions, though returned here,  can not  be  considered as  a part of the record."</p>
<p>Fuller, Chief Justice, in the cause of  Hume <em>vs. </em>Bowie (148 U. S., 246), said, in discussing this same question: "The rule is unquestionably correctly laid down in Muller vs. Ehlers."</p>
<p>Chief Justice Fuller, in the cause of the United States <em>vs.</em> Jones (149 U. S.,  263), again said: "Judgment was rendered in this cause July 18, the writ of error mied out and allowed Juty 23, and the court adjourned for the term July 80.   So  far as is disclosed by the record, the bill of exceptions was not tendered to the judge or signed by him until October 7, and no order was entered extending the time for its  presentation.  The  bill  of  exceptions  was, therefore, improvidcntly allowed," citing again Muller <em>vs.</em> Ehlers.   (Note: The rules of  the court in this  case permitted the court to extend the time within which an appeal might be perfected.)</p>
<p>Chief  Justice  Fuller again,  in the  cause  of  Morse <em>vs.</em> Anderson  (1.50  U.  S., 156),  said:  "The  judgment  is affirmed for want of a bill of exceptions seasonably allowed, upon the authority of Muller vs. Ehlers, Hume vs. Bowie, and other cases cited."</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Shiras, in the case of Ward <em>vs.</em> Cochran  (150 U. S., 597), said: "In the case of Muller <em>vs.</em> Ehlers this court held that, because the bill of exceptions had not been signed at or during the term at which the judgment was rendered, it could not be  considered.  The power  to reduce exceptions taken at the  trial to form and to have them signed and filed was, under ordinary circumstances, confined to a time not later than the term at which judgment was rendered.   This, we think, is the true rule, and one  to which  there  should be  no exceptions, without an express order  of  the court  during the term, or consent  of the parties, save  under very extraordinary circumstances. <em>In the present  case we find  no  order of the court, no consent of the parties, and no such circumstances as  will justify a departure from this rule."</em>  (See, also, Eagle vs. Draper, 14 Blatchford, 334, Federal case  No. 4234; Waldron <em>vs.</em> Waldron, 150 U. S., 361.)</p>
<p>This is also the case in Tennessee.  In the case of Stagg <em>vs.</em> State (13 Humphrey, Tenn., 372), Justice Green said in substance: "The  supreme court can  not notice as a part of the record a bill of exceptions taken and sealed by the court at a term subsequent to that at which the cause  was tried, even if it be a special term, for the law authorizing special terms  constitutes them  distinct terms."   To the same effect are the following Tennessee cases: Davis <em>vs.</em> Jones  (3 Head, 603); Hill <em>vs.</em> Bowers  (4 Heiskell, 272) ; Steel <em>vs.</em> Davis (5 Heiskell, 75); Garrett <em>vs.</em> Kogers  (1 Heiskell, 321).  In Sims <em>vs.</em> State (4 Lea, 357), Justice Cooper, said: "The settled rule in this State  is that the bill of exceptions must be reduced to writing  and signed during the term, nor can it be signed afterwards, although the signature was omitted by an inadvertence on the  part of the judge."</p>
<p>In Vermont the  statute  (sec.  1626,  compiled laws  of 1894) provides that "exceptions to the opinion of the court shall be signed by the presiding judge and filed with the clerk within thirty days after the rising of the court."  In commenting upon this statutory provision, Redfield, Chief Justice, said: "If exceptions taken in the county court are not filed in the clerk's office within thirty days from the rising  of the court, as required by the statute, they can not be entertained or considered in the supreme court.  If they are not actually filed within the thirty days, and if there is no fraud, misconduct, or agreement of the opposite party  respecting them, they can  not  be thereafter  filed <em>nunc pro tunc</em>, as of the date within thirty days."   (Nixon vs. Phelps, 29 Vt., 196; Higbee <em>vs.</em> Sutton, 14 Vt.,  555.)</p>
<p>The code of Mississippi (edition of Thompson, Dillard &amp; Campbell,  1892, sec. 735) provides that:  "Bills of exception to any ruling of the court must be tendered and signed during the trial or during the term of the court."  Justice Chalmers,  in the case of Allen <em>vs.</em> Levy (59 Miss., 613), said: "Section 1718 of the Code of 1880  requires that such bills of exception must be made out  and  presented  to the judge during the term or within ten days after adjournment, and  the court has no power of its own motion  to grant a longer time."</p>
<p>In Massachusetts there is a similar statute, and the  rule there is that it must be strictly complied with.  In the case of Doeherty <em>vs.</em> Lincoln (114 Mass., 362), Gray, Chief Justice (later a member of the  Supreme  Court of the United States), said:  "The provisions of this  statute requiring the exceptions to be filed with the clerk as well as presented to  the  court within the time prescribed are intended <em>for the benefit of the adverse party; and he is entitled to insist upon due proof of a strict  compliance with them</em>, unless lie has done something to waive it. In the present case  therv. is no evidence of such waiver, and the bill of exceptions does not appear by the docket  or tiles of the court below to have been filed with the clerk or presented to  the judge within the time prescribed.   It must, therefore, be dismissed."   (See, also, Pease <em>vs.</em> Whitney, 4 Mass., 507; Conway <em>vs.</em> Callahan, 121 Mass., 165.) In California there is a similar statute, with  the same decisions by the courts.</p>
<p>Section 1365  the statutes of Texas provides that: "It shall be the duty of the  party taking any bill of exceptions to reduce the same to writing and present the same to the judge for his allowance  and signaturiB during the term and within ten days  after  the  conclusion of  the trial."  The courts of that State have repeatedly held that  the terms of this statute must be  strictly complied with.   (Farrar <em>vs.</em> Bates, 55 Tex., 193; Blum <em>vs.</em>  Schram, 58 Tex.,  524; Tex., etc., Ky. Co. <em>vs.</em> McAllister, 59 Tex., 349.)</p>
<p>The rule laid  down  in  the  above cases of Muller <em>vs.</em> Elders, Michigan Bank  <em>vs.</em>  Eldred, and Hume <em>vs.</em> Bowie is quoted and approved in the case of New York, etc., Co. <em>vs.</em> Hyde  (56 Federal Reporter,  188).  See,  also, Reliable Incubator Company <em>vs.</em>  Stahl (102 Federal Rep., 590.)</p>
<p>This rule prevails also in Minnesota.  Gilfillan, Chief Justice, in the case of Burns <em>vs.</em> Phinney  (53 Minn., 431), said:  "After the time  to appeal has expired, there is no authority in  the district court  nor in this court  to give a party a right to appeal after the right given him by the statute has elapsed by his failure to exercise it."</p>
<p>The same rule is enforced in Kentucky.  See Johnson <em>vs.</em> Stevens (95 Ky., 128).  The same rule prevails in Ohio, Illinois, Iowa, Colorado, and Indiana.   (Hicks <em>vs.</em> Person, 19 Ohio,  426; Kinsey <em>vs.</em> Satterthwaite, 88 Indiana,  344; Wabash,  etc., Ry. Co. <em>vs.</em> People, 106 111., 152; 43 Pacific Rep.,  Colo., 903.)</p>
<p>The bill of exceptions under this section constitutes the pleaamgs or statement of facts through which the issue is presented in the  Supreme Court,  The  Supreme Court must rely upon the bill of exceptions for the statement of facts upon which to base its decision.  The pleadings must show on their face that the court has jurisdiction.</p>
<p>It is  urged that appellees waived their  right to object to this  bill of exceptions on the grounds  urged  here, because they did not make them when they were notified of the presentation of the bill of exceptions on July 28.  They had a right to assume, for all purposes at that time, that the bill  of exceptions was presented within the  requirements of the law.  Their mistake in that respect,  however, did not alter the fact that during the term at which judgment was rendered <em>no notice teas given to  the judge or to the opposite  parties by  the  appellants of their desire</em> to present a bill of exceptions or to prosecute an appeal.  The failure  of the appellees to interpose an objection on that ground, at that time, did not place the appellant in a worse position.  There is nothing here which shows or tends to show, even remotely, on the part of the  appellee a purpose to waive his objection to the bill of exceptions.</p>
<p>The lower courts have no authority bv statute,  or otherwise, to waive the  provisions of section  143 of the Code of Civil Procedure.   Neither has this court the right to waive1 the provisions of the said section.  This court may, however, under very extraordinary circumstances, grant relief. These  extraordinary  circumstances  must be made  expressly  to appear to the  satisfaction of  this court.  These extraordinary circumstances must all be conditions  over which the appellant has no control, and, even then, he must have done all within his power to comply  with the provisions of the law  before the court will grant him relief.</p>
<p>When the legislature provides by a plain statute that a particular  thing <em>shall</em> be done in a particular  way, it hardly seems necessary to ask the question whether or not they did not  intend to say also that it might be done or might not be done in some other way,  if some other way happened to suit the whim or convenience  of some person or class of persons.  It is hardly necessary in a statute so plain as section 143 of the new Code of Civil Procedure to read into it a provision which does not there exist.</p>
<p>Judge Elliot in his work on Appellate Procedure states "that the bill of exceptions must be filed within  the time limited; the time  can not be  extended  (sees.  128,  295, and 800).   If a party may omit one step or delay one step until after the expiration of the time, he may omit or delay another, and another.  To establish a  rule which  would tolerate such a practice  would destroy all certainty and uniformity and <em>build up  a deformed and distorted system of  mere arbitrary  instances.</em>   A worse system than that or  one more  directly opposed  to sound principle  can scarcely be imagined."  A strict compliance with section 143 of the Code of Civil Procedure is necessary to give this court jurisdiction.   Neither this court  nor the Court of First Instance has authority to extend the provisions of this statute.  It may be said this rule is technical.  Be it so.</p>
<p>The legislative branch  of the Government has authority over that subject.   The judicial branch of the Government has no right or authority to treat as technical, and therefore disregard  it, a plain statutory provision.</p>
<p>It has been  suggested  that the legislature in enacting section 143 of the Code  of  Civil Procedure "must have known tbat in many cases it would be  a physical impossibility to comply with its terms."</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The legislative  branch of the  Government  in  these Islands lias considered the conditions here and has legislated subsequently  upon  the same subject.  Act  No.  867 of the United States Philippine Commission of September 5, 1903, provides as follows:<br>
    <br>
    "SEC. 14.  <em>Time within  which notice of appeal must be filed in cases under  previous section</em>.—In every case in which judgment is  entered in the Court of First Instance of a province by direction of a judge not in the province at the ¦time, under  the provisions of section 13 hereof, it shall be the duty of the clerk of the court at once to notify the parties to the suit, or their counsel, of the nature of the judgment, by personal notice in writing or registered mail, and in such cases the time within which  the parties shall be required to except to the said judgment, and to file notice of their desire to prosecute their bill of exceptions to the judgment,  shall be extended to twenty days from the day of receipt of the notice from the clerk."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Section 13 of the  said act, to which reference is made above, provides  that "whenever a judge of the Court of First Instance or a justice of the Supreme Court shall hold a session, special  or regular,  of the Court of First Instance of any province and  shall  thereafter leave the province in  which the  court  was held without having entered judgment  in all  the cases which  were heard at such session, it  shall be lawful for him if the case  was heard and  duly argued, or  an opportunity given for an argument to  the parties and their counsel,  in  the proper province, to prepare his judgment after he lias left the province and send the same back, properly  signed, to the clerk of the court,  to be entered in the court as of the day when the same  was received by the clerk  in the same manner as if the judge had been present in court to direct the entry of the judgment."  Had the legislative branch of the Government considered that the  time  mentioned in section 143 was extendible, then why was it necessary for it to enact the provisions found in said section  14?  If, as it has been contended, the time mentioned in section 143 is extendible by the courts, then certainly it was unnecessary for the legislative branch to enact further legislation upon that question.</p>
<p>From the foregoing  provisions it appears that if there are  impossible conditions existing here,  the  legislative branch of this Government will in due time take notice of the same and will  enact such legislation as will be necessary to correct the evil.  The judicial branch of the Government is governed by the laws enacted.</p>
<p>There  is  also another very  serious  objection to the proceedings in this case, and that is, the fact that the judge decided the motion for a new trial after the close of the term in which the judgment was made final.  This is not authorized  by the  law.   Motions for a new trial must be decided during the term in  which the judgments become final.  (See sec. 143 of Code of Civil Procedure.)   If this practice is to be permitted, vexatious delays will be worked on parties in courts below.  These rules are made in order that successful parties may not be defeated by mere delay. If this court may extend the time one day or a month,  it may extend it indefinitely.  Such a  doctrine would  have the effect, finally, of forever defeating the final settlement of causes—the very object of the law.  If this court may extend the terms of the statutes, the Court  of First Instance may, and then instead of having a uniform rule we would have a distorted  practice1 where each case depended upon the particular notion of the particular judge—a practice of mere instances.</p>
<p>It is argued that the Courts of First Instance are always open.  If that is so, then what did the Commission mean in providing different terms of the court?  What is meant by the phrase in section 143 "and before the ending of the term of the court,"  etc.?  If the courts  are always open and terms never close, then it would be safe for the defeated party to wait "forever and a day" before taking steps to appeal.  We think that  provision of the  organic law  has a very different signification.</p>
<p>There is another objection to that part of  the order or decision of this court, by which certain papers are directed to be sent up to this court to be incorporated as  a  part of the bill of exceptions.</p>
<p>A  bill  of exceptions can  not be amended except in accordance with the provisions of section 500 of the Code of Civil Procedure.   This section provides  that a dismissal shall not  be granted "whereby an amendment to the  bill of exceptions  which is hereby declared to be lawful and allowable, any imperfections or omissions  of necessary and proper allegations could be corrected from the record in the case." This section is a literal copy of the provisions contained in section 5567 of the Code of Georgia.  It has been held by the  supreme court of that State in construing  this provision that "record in the case" means record as contained in transcript  sent up  and  duly  certified  by the clerk (79 Ga., 210).  But even if the word "record"  is construed to mean  the record of the case in  the  Court  of First Instance,  and  it is held that the papers which have been directed to be sent up to this court are, in fact, a part of the record of the Court of First Instance, still it  is not contended that these papers were made a part of the bill of exceptions by the trial judge who approved it.</p>
<p>It is necessary that action should be taken in the Court of First Instance, by motion, to amend the bill of exceptions and this application must be made to the judge of the Court of First Instance who tried the case and whose province it is to make up the bill of exceptions aiid approve the same.  (Elliot's App. Pro., 825.)</p>
<p>Nor can the provisions of  section 501 of the Code  of Civil Procedure be invoked as authorizing the amendment of the bill of exceptions by this court.   This section provides the mode for correcting an "incomplete" record and is to the effect that if it is discovered that the record is so incomplete that justice requires the case to be postponed until the record  can be made complete, the court shall postpone the further  consideration  of the same and make such order as may be proper and  necessary to complete the record in the interests of justice.</p>
<p>We do not understand by this provision of the law  that it is contemplated that this court,  when it finds that the bill of exceptions as prepared in the Court of First Instance is defective, shall postpone the further consideration  of the case and make the amendment here, because all amendments to the record in the lower court must be made by that court.  The  higher court  can  not make an original entry for the trial court, nor perform an act which it is the right and duty of the trial court  to perform.   (Elliot's App. Pro., 205.)</p>
<p>This section 501 refers to the case where the record upon which the case is being tried in the  Supreme Court is "incomplete," by reason of the fact that the bill of exceptions as signed and approved by the Court  of First Instance is different and other than that of the record on which the case is being tried in the Supreme Court, and whenever this appears to be the case the court  will, within the language of the statute, "complete the record."</p>
<p>The remedy here provided for is known in American practice as the suggestion of diminution of the record and prevails in the practice of these courts.</p>
<p>The section is taken  almost literally from section 5575 of the Code of Georgia; and the citations of the  decisions of the courts of that  State,  which are contained in  the notes to this section, show  that such was the  purpose of the section.   For instance, it has been held  by the courts of that State, in construing this section,  that where  there is "no judgment appearing in the record,  the case will be delayed until the same  is  sent up."   (65 Ga., 600.)   And where a motion for a new  trial is material, and is referred to in the bill of exceptions not sent  up,  a dismissal  follows if no time is asked to  perfect the bill of exceptions. (74 Ga., 36.)</p>
<p>The motion to dismiss the  bill of exceptions should be granted.</p>
