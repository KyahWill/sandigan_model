				<BR><STRONG>STREET, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In this action the plaintiffs seek to obtain a judicial determination of the 
ownership of certain land situated in the <em>sitio</em> of Fugu, barrio of 
Malabbad, in the Province of Cagayan, and to recover possession thereof from the 
defendants, with damages and costs. From a judgment rendered in the Court of 
First Instance in favor of the plaintiffs the defendants have appealed.
<p>As no motion for a new trial was made in the court below until after the 
appeal had been taken and the bill of exceptions approved, the facts found in 
the trial court will not be reviewed, and the case will be here considered 
merely with reference to such questions of law as are presented upon the appeal. 
In the lower court the defendant Tuliao practically entered a disclaimer as to 
the property; and he will be ignored as a party to this appeal.</p>
<p>It appears that forty or fifty years ago a new island made its appearance in 
the Cagayan River at or near the spot where the land in question is situated. 
This island was called Fugu, a word which, in the native dialect prevailing in 
the Cagayan Valley, means "island." Soon after this island appeared, an ancestor 
of the plaintiffs, named Juan Banatao, established himself upon its northern 
end, while one Quienes and others respectively took possession of separate 
strips extending across the island but lying further south.</p>
<p>As a result of the formation of this island the Cagayan River was divided 
into two branches; and, in course of time, the river has abandoned the eastern 
branch altogether. The old bed of this eastern branch of the river is clearly 
marked by a depression in the land indicating the former course of the stream, 
in which are to be seen deposits of stone and gravel. This area is called in the 
local dialect "Carentan," meaning a sandy beach; and upon it is located the 
present sitio of Carentan.</p>
<p>The change of the river above noted has thus operated to destroy the 
character of Fugu as an island; and it has thereby become connected 
terrestrially with the land lying on the eastern bank of the Cagayan River; but 
the old name remains and the place is now known as the <em>sitio</em> of 
Fugu.</p>
<p>After the island of Fugu was formed changes of importance occurred in its 
location and shape, owing to the shifting of the course of the Cagayan River. 
The general character of these changes was that the upper end of the island, 
that is the southern portion, was gradually eroded and carried away by the 
descending waters of the stream, while as a result of accretion and the deposit 
of alluvium, the northern and northwestern part of the island continually grew 
in size. As a result of this action of the river the island very slowly moved 
northward from the place of its first appearance in the river, and slowly 
increased in size northwardly and westwardly. The process of erosion which was 
going on at the southern end of the island finally carried away altogether the 
strips of land which had been occupied by other settlers than Banatao and 
Quienes and took away all but a very narrow strip of that which had belonged to 
the latter. On the other hand, the process of accretion, which was going on at 
the northern and north-western end of the island, continually added to that 
portion of the island where Juan Banatao had planted himself.</p>
<p>The new area added in the manner above stated is of considerable extent, and 
the plaintiffs allege in their complaint that the land owned by them, including 
the increment added by accretion, amounts to 213 hectares, 36 ares and 82 
centares. The land which is the subject of the present controversy, however, 
consists of a strip extending east and west and containing an area of 12 
hectares, 86 ares and 20 centares, indicated on plaintiff's Exhibit E as 
occupied by Salvador Dabbay.</p>
<p>The possession of the plaintiffs, by their predecessors in interest, dates 
from before the year 1881 and has continued, without interruption except as to 
the part now occupied by the defendant Salvador Dabbay. In the latter part of 
the year 1894 Jacinto Banatao, the son of Juan Banatao, caused a possessory 
information to be drawn up and inscribed in the property register, showing his 
occupation of that portion of the island then in his possession. The 
circumstance that this document was drawn up within a year after February 13, 
1894, would indicate that the title thereby acquired, pursuant to the provisions 
of the royal decree of that date, was equivalent to that which would have been 
obtained by composition with the State. (<em>See</em> Carino <em>vs</em>. 
Insular Government, 8 Phil. Rep., 150.) And as such it was treated by the court 
below. Whether this possessory information actually combined all the requisites 
essential to constitute a title equivalent to a composition title is immaterial, 
since the long duration of the possession and cultivation of the property by the 
plaintiffs and their predecessors in interest has perfected their title, 
whatever may have been the character of the document referred to.</p>
<p>The notable alluvial accretion, of which mention has been made began prior to 
1899, and probably two or three years prior to that date. It is thus seen that 
the accretion which has added so largely to the area of the northern and 
northwestern portion of Fugu has occurred mostly since Jacinto Banatao procured 
his possessory information.</p>
<p>The trial court took judicial notice of the fact that the Cagayan River is a 
navigable stream. This is assigned as error by the appellant. We are of the 
opinion that the court committed no error in so finding. The circumstance that 
section 275 of the Code of Civil Procedure does not especially mention the 
navigability of rivers as a matter concerning which courts may take judicial 
notice is of no moment, as this subject is one which in our opinion is clearly 
within the general principle there stated. After mentioning numerous matters 
proper to be judicially noticed by the court, among which are the territorial 
extent of the several islands, forming the Philippine Archipelago and its 
geographical divisions, said section states that "all similar matters of public 
knowledge shall be recognized by the courts without the introduction of proof * 
* *."</p>
<p>In conformity with the principle thus stated the courts may take judicial 
notice of the existence and location within the territory over which they 
exercise jurisdiction of great rivers and lakes, and their relation to the 
national or provincial boundaries, of the navigability of streams constituting 
highways of commerce and other notorious facts concerning the same. The 
presumption of general knowledge weakens as we pass to smaller and less known 
streams; and yet, within the limits of any state the navigability of its largest 
rivers ought to be generally known, and the courts may properly assume it to be 
a matter of general knowledge, and take judicial notice thereof. (Wood 
<em>vs</em>. Fowler, 26 Kan., 682, 687; 40 Am. Rep, 330.)</p>
<p>The suggestion made in behalf of the appellants to the effect that a river in 
these Islands cannot be considered navigable unless it has been declared such in 
conformity with the requirements of article 175 of the Law of Waters is in our 
opinion untenable. </p>
<p>Upon the facts above stated the plaintiffs claim the ownership of the land in 
question as an accretion, supporting their contention by reference to the 
following provisions of law:</p>
<p>Article 371 of Civil Code: "Islands which may form * * * in navigable or 
floatable rivers belong to the State."</p>
<p>Article 366 of Civil Code: "Any accretions which the banks of rivers may 
gradually receive from the effect of the current belong to the owners of the 
estates bordering thereon."</p>
<p>Article 84, Law of Waters: "Accretions deposited gradually upon lands 
contiguous to creeks, streams, rivers and lakes, by accessions or sediments from 
the waters thereof, belong to the owners of such lands."</p>
<p>It will thus be seen that the arguments in favor of ownership in the 
plaintiffs proceed upon the idea that the island of Fugu was originally property 
of the State, that the plaintiffs' ancestor acquired title from the State by 
occupation and by virtue of the possessory information recorded in his name, and 
that all the accretion to said property belongs, under the provisions above 
cited, to him and his heirs.</p>
<p>The conflicting claim of the defendant Salvador Dabbay is based on the 
circumstance that he owns, or claims to have owned for a long period of time, a 
parcel of land on the east side of the abandoned bed of the Cagayan River, and 
lying east of the place where the new land was formed in the <em>sitio</em> of 
Fugu. In his answer to the amended complaint in this case, this defendant 
alleges that the Cagayan River which originally formed the western boundary of 
his property, had gradually receded toward the west, forming and uniting new and 
alluvial land to his property. This allegation of fact is refuted by the finding 
of the lower court, which clearly demonstrates that the Cagayan River abandoned 
the old eastern bed for a new course and did not gradually shift its course in 
the manner stated in the defendant's answer.</p>
<p>The circumstance that the Cagayan River abandoned the old eastern bed, 
instead of gradually shifting its course to the west, makes it impossible for 
the defendant Salvador Dabbay to maintain his claim to any part of the land in 
controversy as an accretion, in accordance with article 366 of the Civil Code, 
and article 84 of the Law of Waters; but reference is made in his behalf to 
article 373 of the Civil Code and article 83 of the Law of Waters. These 
articles declare that an island formed in a river by the successive accumulation 
of deposits belongs to the riparian owners on the respective banks of the 
stream, unless the island is farther from one bank than from the other, in which 
case it shall belong to the owner of the nearest bank.</p>
<p>We are of the opinion that the case is one which falls more properly under 
article 366 of the Civil Code and article 84 of the Law of Waters than under 
article 373 of the Civil Code and that the plaintiffs therefore have the better 
right. As was well observed by the trial judge the plaintiffs' predecessors were 
the first to appropriate the new island; there is no evidence as to the width of 
the eastern and western branch of the river at the time the island was formed; 
nor as to who were the opposite riparian owners. Nor does it appear that any 
person claimed Fugu or any part of it, as riparian owner. The island was 
evidently treated as part of the public domain, and the plaintiffs are therefore 
to be considered as having acquired their title from the government.</p>
<p>In this connection we quote the following passage from the opinion of the 
trial court.</p>
<p>"The litigated property could in no sense have been an accretion to the 
parcel claimed to be owned by the defendants. When the Law of Waters and the 
Civil Code (articles 84 and 366, respectively) speak of accretions to the banks 
of rivers, the term 'banks of rivers' is not necessarily confined to the banks 
which confine streams, but may when circumstances require it, also include the 
banks of rivers which exist on islands. Here it is shown that an island in the 
river was appropriated and a grant for the part of the same obtained by the 
plaintiffs from the State. This island or so much thereof as was appropriated 
and granted, must be treated, therefore, as property of original acquisition and 
not as accession or derivative acquisition, and, with regard to the owners on 
the shores opposite to it on both sides, it must be treated as if the 
intervening streams were distinct streams, and as if the island were mainland 
between which, and the mainland on each side, a separate river flowed."</p>
<p>The defendant Salvador Dabbay further relies upon the defense of <em>res 
adjudicata</em> and shows that on March 2, 1909, a judgment was entered in the 
Court of First Instance of Cagayan Province in his favor in an action instituted 
by him against Domingo Banatao, Juan Banatao, and Manuel Magalad, wherein said 
defendants were ordered to return said land to Salvador Dabbay. The latter 
asserts that he was put in possession of the property in question by virtue of 
said judgment and has subsequently held possession in pursuance thereof. The 
lower court found that said action was originally instituted in the court of the 
justice of the peace under section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure, that it 
was appealed to the Court of First Instance under section 88 of the same Code 
and that in the latter court judgment was rendered as above stated. Upon these 
facts the court held that the action in question involved merely the right of 
possession of the property in question, and that the judgment relied upon was 
not conclusive as to the ownership. We are of the opinion that this conclusion 
was correct in point both of law and of fact. The prayer of the complaint filed 
in the Court of First Instance was that the court should give judgment 
condemning the defendants to restore the possession of said land to the 
plaintiffs with damages and costs. The action was evidently one for unlawful 
detention; and, although it was necessary for the court to consider the 
ownership, as bearing upon the right of possession, the judgment of the Court of 
First Instance was not conclusive as to the title.</p>
<p>From what has been said it results that there was no error in the judgment 
appealed from and the same is affirmed, with costs against the appellant. So 
ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Johnson, Carson, Malcolm, Avanceña</em>, and <em>Fisher, 
JJ.</em>, concur.</p></div>
