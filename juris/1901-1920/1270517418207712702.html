				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This&nbsp; defendant was&nbsp; accused of the crime&nbsp; of conspiring to commit sedition.&nbsp; The complaint was in&nbsp; the following language:<br><blockquote>"That on or about the 1st&nbsp; day of September, 1910, the said defendant, in and around the township of&nbsp; Bambang, Nueva Vizcaya,&nbsp; in the jurisdiction of this court,&nbsp; did conspire to rise publicly and tumultuously in order to attain by&nbsp; force or outside of legal methods, the infliction of acts of hate or revenge upon officials or agents of the Insular Government, the provincial government of Nueva Vizcaya, and the municipal government of Bambang; the infliction, with a political or social object, of acts of hate or revenge upon certain&nbsp; individuals or classes of individuals in the Islands; the despoliation, with a political or social object, of certain classes of persons, natural and artificial, in the township of Bambang, the Province of Nueva Vizcaya, and the Insular Government, and the property thereof; and did utter seditious&nbsp; words tending to instigate others&nbsp; to cabal or meet together for unlawful purposes, suggesting or inciting rebellious conspiracies, tending to stir up the people against the lawful authorities and tending to disturb the peace of the community and the safety and order of the Government, and did knowingly&nbsp; conceal such&nbsp; evil practices&nbsp; from&nbsp; the constituted authorities; contrary to law."<br><br>Upon this complaint the defendant was duly arrested and upon arraignment pleaded "not guilty."<br></blockquote>After hearing the evidence adduced&nbsp; during the trial of the cause, the Honorable Richard Campbell, judge, found the defendant guilty of the crime of conspiring to commit sedition, as&nbsp; alleged in the complaint, and sentenced him to be imprisoned for a&nbsp; period of three years, to pay a fine of Pl,000, and in case&nbsp; of insolvency to suffer subsidiary&nbsp; imprisonment&nbsp; in accordance with the&nbsp; law, and to pay&nbsp; the costs.<br><br>From the sentence of the lower court the defendant appealed and made the following assignments of error in this court:<br><blockquote>"I.&nbsp; The court erred in not dismissing the case for&nbsp; the reason that&nbsp; the complaint was defective.<br><br>"IL. The court erred in finding that the&nbsp; evidence introduced at the trial by the prosecution justifies the conviction of the defendant.<br><br>"Ill,&nbsp; The court erred in not acquitting&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant, inasmuch as his guilt was not proved beyond all reasonable doubt."<br></blockquote>With reference to the&nbsp; first assignment&nbsp; of error it will be noted that no objection whatever was made in the court below with reference to&nbsp; the&nbsp; sufficiency of the complaint. This&nbsp; court has held in many decisions that when no objection is made to the sufficiency of the complaint in the court below, the objection will not be considered on appeal.&nbsp; Objections of this character can not be considered for the first time&nbsp; on&nbsp; appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp; (U. S.&nbsp; <i>vs.</i>. Mabanag, 1 Phil. Rep.,&nbsp; 441; U. S. <i>vs.</i> Cajayon, 2 Phil.&nbsp; Rep., 570; U. S. <i>vs.</i> Mack, 4 Phil. Rep., 291; U. S. <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Sarabia, 4 Phil Rep., 566; Mortiga <i>vs.</i> Serra, 5 Phil. Rep., 34; (See also&nbsp; 204 U. S.,&nbsp; 470, and 11 Phil.&nbsp; Rep., 762); U. S, <i>vs</i>. Paraiso, 5 Phil. Rep., 149;&nbsp; (See also case&nbsp; of Paraiso, 207 U.&nbsp; S., 368, also 11 Phil.&nbsp; Rep., 799) ; U. S. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs. </span>Aldos, 6 Phil.&nbsp; Rep., 381; U.

Rep.,&nbsp; 409.)<br><br>The other two assignments&nbsp; of error relate only to the sufficiency&nbsp; of the&nbsp; evidence.&nbsp; Many&nbsp; witnesses&nbsp; were&nbsp; presented both by&nbsp; the&nbsp; government and the defendant.&nbsp;&nbsp; The facts&nbsp; in the present case bear&nbsp; a very close relation to the facts&nbsp; in the&nbsp; cases of U. S.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Mandac<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> (No. 6763), and U. S. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Isidro Olano <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> (No. 6882).<br><br>After hearing the evidence, the Honorable Richard Campbell, judge, in his decision, made the following findings of fact.<br><blockquote>"After seeing the witnesses and hearing them testify, and after&nbsp; carefully observing&nbsp; their conduct and bearing while on the witness stand, and after considering all the evidence and listening to the arguments of counsel on both sides, the court declares to have been proven the following facts beyond a reasonable&nbsp; doubt:<br><br>"That on the 1st day of September, 1910, an uprising or insurrection against the authority of the United States in the Philippine Islands, and having for its object the overthrow of&nbsp; the Government of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippine&nbsp; Islands,&nbsp; and provincial and&nbsp; municipal&nbsp; governments of the Province of Nueva&nbsp; Vizcaya and other&nbsp; provinces&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Philippine Islands, took place in and about the township of Solano in the Province of Nueva Vizcaya.<br><br>"That the defendant, Maximino Planas, was the president of the&nbsp; town of Bambang,&nbsp; Nueva&nbsp; Vizcaya,&nbsp; duly&nbsp; elected, qualified, and acting as such on and&nbsp; during all the dates and times&nbsp; mentioned in the complaint.&nbsp; That on the 3d day of September, 1910, the said Maximino Planas called together the&nbsp; policemen of the said town of Bambang and said to them,&nbsp; 'The <i>insurrectos</i> have&nbsp; entered Solano and seized the money from the treasury, burned the papers, and made prisoners of the <i>padres.</i>&nbsp; Now you must bring your arms to my house so that. I&nbsp; can deliver&nbsp; them to the <i>insurrectos</i> when they reach here and you must all be ready to join the <i>insurrectos </i>when&nbsp; they reach&nbsp; Bambang&nbsp; because I am captain of <i>insurrectos,</i> and when they come&nbsp; we will kill the Americans Bennett&nbsp; and Scott and the Romanista <i>padre,</i>&nbsp; and burn the convent.&nbsp; Do not tell anything of this to the Americans or the <i>insurrectos</i> will kill you when they come,'&nbsp; or words to that effect.&nbsp; That on Sunday,&nbsp; the 4th day of September, 1910, between 9 and 10 o'clock, the councilmen&nbsp; of Bambang&nbsp; assembled at the presidencia&nbsp; of said town in obedience to a call or <i>bandillo</i> which had been published the previous evening in said town by the defendant. At this meeting there were&nbsp; present the following&nbsp; councilmen : Proceso Sierra, Martin Apno, Marcelino Alvarez, Angel Malonoy,&nbsp; Santiago&nbsp; Corales, and&nbsp; Francisco Pugayan, and President Planas, the accused.&nbsp; And that the&nbsp; accused then told the assembled councilmen that the&nbsp; <i>insurrectos </i>had entered Solano, seized the&nbsp; municipal funds,&nbsp; burned the papers,&nbsp; and&nbsp; made&nbsp; prisoners&nbsp; of the Romanista&nbsp; <i>padres.</i> 'Prepare your people with&nbsp; arms, bolos, spears, and arrows, and when the <i>insurrectos</i>&nbsp; arrive in this town&nbsp; be ready&nbsp; to join them,&nbsp; and then we&nbsp; will kill the Americans Bennett and Scott and the Romanista padre/ or words to that effect.<br><br>"That on the 2d day of September, 1910,&nbsp; in the house of the Councilman Martin&nbsp; Apno,&nbsp; of the town of Bambang, Nueva&nbsp; Vizcaya, the accused had a conversation with the aforementioned&nbsp; Councilman Martin Apno in which the accused said 'Do you know what has happened in Solano? The <i>insurrectos</i>&nbsp; have&nbsp; entered there and taken the money and burned the&nbsp; papers,' and that said&nbsp; Councilman Apno must prepare bolos, lances, and other arms and when the <i>insurrectos </i>entered be&nbsp; prepared&nbsp; to join&nbsp; them and that after that they would kill Mr.&nbsp; Bennett and Mr. Scott and the Roman <i>padre</i> of the&nbsp; town of Bambang, Nueva Vizcaya.<br><br>"These&nbsp; facts&nbsp; were&nbsp; conclusively&nbsp; and&nbsp; overwhelmingly proven by the testimony of the prosecution which consisted of the evidence of four policemen of the town of Bambang, Pantaleon Pugayan,&nbsp; Pedro Sierra,&nbsp; Santiago Angala, and Emeterio&nbsp; Marquez; three councilmen&nbsp; of said town whose names were Proceso Sierra, Martin Apno, and Angel Malanoy, and&nbsp; the municipal treasurer of Bambang, Ventura Bernal, and his clerk Martiniano Miralles.&nbsp;&nbsp; The policemen testified that they&nbsp; assembled, four in number, at&nbsp; about 4 o'clock in&nbsp; the afternoon&nbsp; in the&nbsp; <i>presidencia </i> of Bambang&nbsp; by order of the defendant on the 3d of September, 1910, and that the defendant then&nbsp; told them to deliver their&nbsp; arms to his house as he, the defendant, was a captain of insurrectos and that he (the defendant) would&nbsp; deliver said arms to the insurrectos when they entered the town of Bambang.&nbsp; The defendant also told the four policemen that the <i>insurrectos</i> had already entered Solano, seized the municipal funds and burned the papers, and&nbsp; that when they&nbsp; (the <i>insurrectos</i>) reached Bambang to be&nbsp; ready to join them and that they would then kill the two Americans, Bennett and Scott, and the Roman padre and&nbsp; burn the convent.&nbsp; On the next day, the 4th of September, when six councilmen assembled&nbsp; in the presidencia of&nbsp; Bambang in obedience to his order the defendant repeated substantially the same&nbsp; conversation&nbsp; as he&nbsp; had with the policemen.&nbsp; He&nbsp; told the councilmen&nbsp; to prepare their people with arms of all kinds, bolos, lances, and arrows, and be ready to join the insurrectos when they reached Bambang, after which they (the insurrectos) would kill the Americans Scott and Bennett, and the Romanista <i>padre</i>, and burn the convent.&nbsp; He also told the councilmen that the <i>insurrectos</i> had already entered Solano, seized the municipal funds and&nbsp; burned&nbsp; the papers, and that when they&nbsp; (the <i>insurrectos</i>) entered Bambang, they, the councilmen and their people, would hear the salvos of the police at the&nbsp; presidencia and&nbsp; this would&nbsp; be the signal to join forces with the&nbsp; <i>insurrectos</i>."</blockquote>After a careful reading of the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause and brought to this court, we are of the opinion that the findings&nbsp; of fact made by the lower court are in accordance with such evidence, and show that the defendant was guilty of the crime charged beyond per-adventure of&nbsp; doubt, and that the sentence imposed by the lower court is in&nbsp; accordance with&nbsp; the law.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Sec, 7,&nbsp; Act No. 292.)&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; sentence of the lower court&nbsp; is, therefore, hereby&nbsp; affirmed with costs.<br><br><i>Arellano, C.
