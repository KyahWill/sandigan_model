				<H3>THE  UNITED STATES,  PLAINTIFF  AND  APPELLEE, VS. VICTOR
SOLINAP, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The defendant in this case was convicted of the crime of stealing two carabaos,&nbsp; on proof that these&nbsp; carabaos were stolen from the corral&nbsp; of the complaining witness&nbsp; on the night of&nbsp; the 16th&nbsp; of March, 1909,&nbsp; and that one of them was found in defendant's corral on the 24th of the following April.<br><br>Defendant admitted that the carabao found in his corral was not his property, and, in explanation of its presence there, attempted to prove that&nbsp; it had&nbsp; been intrusted to his care by a man named Iping, deceased at the time of the trial.&nbsp; We are of opinion, however, that the evidence introduced&nbsp; by the defendant in support&nbsp; of his explanation of the&nbsp; presence of this carabao in his&nbsp; corral can not be credited, because not only is it self-contradictory&nbsp; in various minor details, but also,&nbsp; and chiefly, because if believed, we would be forced to the&nbsp; conclusion that&nbsp; the animal&nbsp; was not taken from the corral of the complaining witness&nbsp; on the night of the 16th of March, 1909, defendant's witnesses testifying, as they&nbsp; did,&nbsp; that&nbsp; Iping had turned the animal over to the&nbsp; defendant long before the night when the complaining witness claims to have lost&nbsp; it.&nbsp; But the evidence of the loss&nbsp; of the&nbsp; identical carabao&nbsp; found in&nbsp; defendant's corral from the corral of&nbsp; the complaining witness on&nbsp; the night of the 16th of March is so positive, definite, and conclusive&nbsp; that it does not admit of doubt,&nbsp; and we are&nbsp; of opinion therefore that defendant's explanation of the presence of the stolen&nbsp; animal in&nbsp; his corral is not&nbsp; worthy&nbsp; of belief, and&nbsp; is&nbsp; not sufficient to rebut&nbsp; the&nbsp; presumption&nbsp; of his guilt arising from the&nbsp; discovery of the stolen carabao in his corral not long after the crime was committed.<br><br>There is evidence in the record which tends to disclose that the other carabao stolen from the complaining witness was also found in defendant's corral; but the evidence as to the&nbsp; identity&nbsp; of the second&nbsp; carabao found in&nbsp; defendant's corral with the second carabao stolen from the complaining witness is not conclusive, and&nbsp; we&nbsp; therefore&nbsp; refrain&nbsp; from any attempt&nbsp; to make&nbsp; a finding on this&nbsp; point.&nbsp; But whatever may be the fact as to the identity of the second carabao, the unexplained discovery of one of two&nbsp; carabaos,&nbsp; stolen on the&nbsp; same night from the&nbsp; same corral, in the possession of the defendant not long after the commission of the crime, is sufficient&nbsp; in itself to sustain a&nbsp; finding&nbsp; of the guilt&nbsp; of the defendant of the theft of&nbsp; both the animals.<br><br>The judgment of conviction and the&nbsp; sentence&nbsp; imposed by the trial court should&nbsp; therefore be&nbsp; affirmed with&nbsp; the&nbsp; costs of this&nbsp; instance against the appellant.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Johnson, JJ.</span>, concur.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Moreland</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Trent, JJ.</span>, dissent.</div>
