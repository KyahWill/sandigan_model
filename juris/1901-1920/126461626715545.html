				G.R. No. 1103, August 19, 1903</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED  STATES AND  MARIANO  BENIFAYO, COMPLAINANTS AND APPELLEES, VS, EUSTAQUIO RABADILLAS, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.

				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The defendant is charged with having obtained  from Mariano Benifayo, by means of intimidation, 50 of the 100 pesos which he had demanded of him.  The accused, who was  a sergeant in the Constabulary, took Benifayo from  his house by means of two armed soldiers, and, pretending that Benifayo had been sent  for by the Court of First Instance, told him that he would bind him and send him there if he did not sign  a  promissory  note  for 100 pesos.  The court below, upon proof of  the  crime, condemned the defendant to eight years  and  one  day of <em>presidio  mayor</em>, with  the costs, considering  as  aggravating circumstances  that  the  accused  availed  himself  of his official position, and also the abuse of authority,  and the commission of the crime with the aid of armed men, citing paragraphs 9, 11, and 14 of article 10 of the Penal  Code. None of these circumstances should be  considered in aggravation of  the offense, as in this particular case they are all but part of the intimidation which  gives  the quality of robbery to the taking of the property of another, and the, last two circumstances mentioned are identical  with respect to the purpose of the crime.  The penalty is therefore excessive.</p>
<p>But this case should not be decided in accordance  with the Penal Code.  On the 8th of March,  1902, the  date on which the crime  was committed, Act No. 175, by which the Insular police was organized, was in force, that act having been passed June 18, 1901.   The crime committed by the sergeant in his official capacity being punished by section  19 of the act by imprisonment  from  one to ten years, the case should be decided in accordance with that law.</p>
<p>We therefore condemn Eustaquio  Rabadillas to  four years' imprisonment and  to the payment of the costs.</p>
<p><em>Torres,  Cooper, Willard, Mapa,</em> and <em>McDonough, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
