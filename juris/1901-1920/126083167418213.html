				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Late at night on the 1st of February, 1905, Canuto Macasa, the owner of an hacienda, was awakened by the noise made by thirty carabaos that were kept in his corral  near the house, and on looking out the window saw that some of them were loose; he then called his workmen to  corral the animals and count them over, and upon their doing so the men found two castrated carabaos and a caraballa missing and that the fence on  its northern side had been cut open with a bolo.   Search was at once made and continued for some days, one of the carabaos being found in the corral of Gerardo Villalobos, at the sitio of  Mataboy,  which Vilalobos stated he had purchased from  Gabino Soriano; another was found  in the possession of the latter  in a cocoanut grove in the same place, and on being questioned as to whence the animal came, he alleged having purchased it at Guiljungan; a few days later the caraballa was found in the municipality of Guimbalaon, where it was taken by order of Cornelio Hilado, who stated that it had been recovered by his son a few nights previously, it having been abandoned by unknown parties who ran and left it upon being challenged by the night patrol of his hacienda.</p>
<p>It appears that one of the carabaos was  originally acquired by the injured party from a Chinaman named Nicolas Ti  Cuico (p. 16, record) and  the other carabao and the caraballa were bred on his hacienda and are branded with his  brand registered in the municipality of Manapla, according to the certificate on page 17 and the statement of the owner, which  is confirmed by  his workmen, who recognized  and duly identified the animals, which  are valued at P375.</p>
<p>A complaint was presented by the provincial fiscal under date of the 1st of September, 1905, accusing Gabino Soriano of the crime of robbery by having stolen the two said carabaos and a caraballa, breaking  open the corral  where they  were  inclosed.   Thereupon  proceedings  were  instituted,  and  the judge, on  the  20th  of  April,  1906, rendered judgment, sentencing the accused as accessory to pay a fine  of 2,500 pesetas and in  case of insolvency  to suffer subsidiary imprisonment,  which should not  exceed six  months, and to pay  the  costs,  reserving to Gerardo Villalobos his  right of action against the accused for the selling of one of said carabaos, setting  aside  the order for deposit and ordering  the final return of the carabaos  to their owner; from which judgment the accused appealed.</p>
<p>The above  duly proven facts constitute the crime  of theft denned and punished by articles 517 and 518, No. 2, of the Penal Code; the breaking of the fence of the corral made of bamboo only, in order to release the carabaos that were therein impounded, can not qualify the  crime as robbery as charged in the complaint, said crime only deserving the name of theft according to the settled rule of the courts, in view of the  very light  construction of the corrals built in these Islands for  the  impounding of large cattle, the same being  only bamboos stuck in the ground with crosspieces tied thereto with rattan or strips of fresh bamboo; as  regards  the  OAvnership, preexistence  and subsequent loss of the castrated carabaos and caraballa stolen from the corral of Canuto Macasa in his hacienda called San Koque, town of Manapla, Occidental Negros, the same have been duly proven by valid documents and by the testimony of the injured party and several witnesses, who recognized and identified the stolen carabaos as the  lawful property of the prejudiced party.</p>
<p>The accused pleaded not guilty, but notwithstanding his denial and allegations the cause furnishes proofs and data sufficient to establish beyond doubt his culpability as principal of the theft of three carabaos, valued at more than 1,250 pesetas but less than 6,250, taking into account that the caraballa disappeared at the same time as the carabaos stolen from the  same corral where they were impounded together.</p>
<p>It is an unquestionable fact and fully proven that one of the carabaos was found in his possession, and that without denying such possession he attempted to justify it by showing that he  had acquired said  animal at Guiljungan and that the transfer of  the same had been recorded in the municipality of said town on the 17th of June, 1902.  This proved to be untrue  because the municipal president of Cauayan,  to which town  Guiljungan was annexed, reported that at said municipality no stub of a certificate for large cattle  issued  at  the date  named by  the  accused existed, and, on the other hand, the latter did not produce any document to prove his ownership, as would have been the case if his statement were true.</p>
<p>It is likewise unquestionable that the carabao found in the possession of Gerardo Villalobos .came from  the accused, who sold  it without proving that the same was his lawful property, inasmuch as the  certificates appearing on pages 30 and 31,  issued in the town of Silay on the 24th of February, 1905, were contrary to the provisions of the administrative law  for the transfer of  large cattle; and having been issued twenty-three days after the animal was stolen, such certificates, far from establishing the lawful origin of the  carabao  sold to Villalobos, confirmed the guilt of the accused, who attempted to justify by said certificates the origin and possession of the stolen carabao, in spite of the fact that said carabao,  like all the others belonging to the same owner, was branded with  his brand, which was duly registered in the municipality of Manapla, and that  a new brand was put on the animal  by the accused.  The truth is that he was unable or unwilling to produce the old certificate in order  to show his ability to lawfully sell and transfer it to Villalobos, the purchaser; and also to show that the legal  requisites had been complied with in  the execution of  said certificates, that at page 31 of the record, in his name, without previous proof that the carabao mentioned therein and then presented in the municipality of Silay was  his, and also the certificate at page 30, without proof that he, as owner of the carabao, had the right to.sell it to Villalobos.   All such  irregularities are the result of arrangements or illegal transactions apt to be resorted to in order to conceal the crime, and give the unlawful possession of cattle a legal appearance.</p>
<p>We can not accept the opinion of the court below when considering the question of the  liability of the accused, inasmuch as upon proof that  one of the stolen carabaos was in his possession, the theory of criminal liability makes him, in absence of evidence to the contrary, principal in the theft of the carabaos and not a  mere accessory to the crime because he has not even attempted to prove their  receipt from a third party; on the contrary, he had the boldness to declare or to attempt to prove to  the court below that said carabaos belonged to him;  and whenever stolen property is discovered fn the possession of a person, unless proof be offered that another stole the same,  the law assumes that the bearer or holder thereof is the principal in  the crime. It is unquestionable, for the reason set forth, that Gabino Soriano deserves to  be considered as principal, as otherwise the conviction  of the  principal in a  crime of theft would but seldom  occur and  the real thieves  would be shielded, with liability as mere accessories, which in criminal law are characterized in a very different manner.</p>
<p>It should be taken into account that the accused has a bad record and that he has  been subjected to several proceedings for crimes similar to the one at bar, and that in  the Island of Negros a  certain  society  of  criminals existed engaged  in  stealing carabaos, to the most serious detriment of agriculture.</p>
<p>In the commission of  this crime  aggravating  circumstance 15 of article  10 of the Penal Code should be considered for the reason  that it was committed in the darkness and silence of night; no extenuating circumstance to counteract its effects being present, the  adequate penalty  to be imposed is <em>presidio  correccional </em>in  its minimum and medium degrees, applying it in  its maximum degree.</p>
<p>For the considerations above set forth the judgment appealed from should be reversed and  Gabino Soriano sentenced, as we do hereby sentence him,  to the penalty  of three years of <em>presidio correccional</em>, to suffer the accessory penalties of article 58 of the Penal Code, to pay the costs of both instances, and confirming the last two clauses  of the sentence appealed from.   So ordered.</p>
