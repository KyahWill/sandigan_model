				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The judgment impugned in the aforesaid bill  of exceptions, presented by defendant, orders among other things the exclusion from the liquidations therein admitted of the sum of $18,712.08¾ representing the credits and  property mentioned by plaintiff  in the liquidation  contained in his complaint.  No legal reason is given for such an exclusion. The credits and property in question pertained to the extinguished partnership, hence the interest that each partner  has  therein  is unquestionable.   Therefore it  is  not possible to consider the liquidation as finally settled and ended or determine which of the partners is the true debtor according, thereto; consequently  the judgment  excepted to can not be sustained, as  it does not definitely decide or determine the question pending as  to the mere exclusion or  omission of the sum  referred to.  This item, having been acknowledged by both parties, should necessarily be included  in  the final settlement of the affairs of  the partnership, and must be taken.into account in the liquidation and determination of the suit pending between the parties.</p>
<p>The profit and loss of the partnership must  be divided in the manner stipulated, and if the agreement should only refer to the participation of each partner in the profits then their corresponding share of the losses shall be in  the same ratio.</p>
<p>In the absence of an agreement the share of each partner in the profits anil  losses shall he in proportion to what he may  have contributed.  The partner who contributes his services only shall receive a share equal to the one who has contributed the least.  If besides his services  he  should have contributed capital, he shall also receive the proportional share which  may pertain to him for his capital. (Art. 1689) of the Civil Code.)</p>
<p>The partition between the partners  is  governed as to the  form  and the obligations arising therefrom  by the rules of succession.  The industrial partner can not claim for himself any part of the property contributed;  he can share only in the profits and benefits, in conformity with the provisions of article 1689, if the contrary should have not been expressly stipulated.</p>
<p>The judgment rendered below and brought before us on exception  should have1 decided  the  issues in accordance with  these legal principles and the provisions contained in the Civil Code with respect to the division of estates among heirs.</p>
<p>Without the inclusion of the amount referred  to as having been omitted in the liquidation and final  settlement of the business engaged  in  by the  partnership existing between the parties, there would be no legal means of fixing definitely in the final liquidation and decision of the case the amount of profits and losses had by the partnership. For this reason the judgment appealed can not be sustained.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court in the exercise of  its  appellate jurisdiction can either affirm, reverse, or modify any final judgment,  order, or decree and can direct that the  proper judgment be entered, or that a new trial be had.  The latter, in the opinion of this court, would be the proper action in the case before us, so that after a complete liquidation is made final judgment  may be rendered in  the  premises.</p>
<p>Wherefore, in view of the provisions of article 496 of the Code  of Civil Procedure and for the foregoing reasons, this court deems it proper that the final judgment excepted to by defendant, Nery Linan, be set aside and a new trial had upon the issues raised by the parties, the judge to proceed in accordance with law, with no special order as to the costs of this instance.   It is so ordered.</p>

<em>DISSENTING</em></div>
<p><strong>WILLARD, J.,</strong> with whom <strong>LADD, J.,</strong> concurs:</p>
<p>I dissent.  There is no certificate by the judge nor any statement in the bill of exceptions that it, the bill of exceptions, contains all the evidence produced and all  the proceedings had at the trial in the court below.  On  the contrary it plainly appears from the contents thereof that it does not contain all the proceedings.  The appellee made two  motions in this court that the entire record be sent here in order that the imperfections in the bill of exceptions might be corrected.  These motions were opposed by the appellant and denied by this court.  Why the court below excluded this sum of $18,712.08¾ from the  accounting does not appear. To the judgment which so  excluded  it the appellant took no exception.  He moved  for a  new trial on the ground that the findings  of fact Avere manifestly against the weight of the evidence, but said nothing about any error of law in excluding this sum from the accounting. It is more than probable that it consisted almost entirely of uncollectible accounts due the firm.  That each party charged the other with the loss suffered by  reason  of the uncollectibility of these accounts does appear.   The parties may have preferred to leave them out of the liquidation, each  one retaining his  interest  in them and  dividing between themselves later anything realized from them. It is not unlikely that, if we  had the whole  record  before us it would appear that the appellant consented that this item might be left  out.  The appellant ought  not to be allowed  to bring here an incomplete record, to  oppose  all efforts to have  it perfected, and to secure a reversal  of the judgment,  when if  we had  before us all that  the court below had before it when the judgment was rendered such judgment might have to be affirmed.<br>
