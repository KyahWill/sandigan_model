				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, EOMPLAINANT AND APPELLANT, VS. ROSARIO DE GUZMAN, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.

				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> About 10 o'clock in the morning of October 16,  1900, Kosario de Guzman went to  the house of Doña Victorina Leonquingco, located in  the  district of Santa  Cruz, and, on the pretense that she had a purchaser who wished to see the jewels, took from  the latter several pieces of gold jewelry set  with diamonds,  of the total value of  730 pesos. These she promised to return, or to pay over their value in case they were sold, on the afternoon of the same day. As she did not do so, the  son of the owner of the jewelry went in search of her on the following day.  lie was not able to find her until some days  had passed, and then the  defendant Guzman pleaded  with Leonquingco that she be given an extension of  time  for the return of the jewelry.   She failed, however, upon various  pretexts, to return the jewels.</p>
<p> The facts related are fully proved in  the cause by the testimony of several witnesses and by the confession of the defendant,  and  constitute the  crime  of embezzlement (<em>estafa</em>), defined and penalized in article 534, No. 2, and article 535, No. 5, of the Penal Code, since evidence shows that Rosario de Guzman had received from the complaining witness, Victorina Leonquingco, various pieces of jewelry, valued at 730 pesos, for the purpose of selling them, subject to the express obligation of delivering their value or returning them to their owner if they should not be sold. Not having done so, and having failed to give an account of their whereabouts, the legal  presumption arises that the defendant abstracted  and appropriated to herself the jewelry received, to the grave prejudice of the owner of the same, inasmuch as she neither returned them nor paid their value,  as was her duty.</p>
<p> Of the crime charged, the sole proven principal by direct participation, confessed and  convicted, is  the defendant, Rosario de Guzman.   Her assertion, even if substantiated, that she delivered the jewels to a broker, who states that she either lost them later or that they were stolen from her—and there is no proof of this—and that the complaining witness has entered into an agreement with her for the payment of their value in installments, would constitute no defense. The reason for this is that it is not within the discretion  of the parties to change the nature of criminal causes, which are public in character, by converting them into civil actions; and the alleged agreement, even if true and established by proof, would not demonstrate that there has not been fraud on the^part of the accused, or prejudice to the owner  of the  jewelry;  fraud and prejudice which took place and which may not be atoned by the restoration of the embezzled property, the greater part of which, indeed, has not been restored.</p>
<p> In the commission  of this crime there is no extenuating or aggravating circumstance to be considered, and therefore the appropriate penalty should be imposed in its medium degree.</p>
<p> By virtue of  the foregoing  considerations we  deem it proper that the  judgment  appealed from be reversed and that Rosario de Guzman be condemned  to the penalty of five months of <em>arresto mayor</em>, together with  the accessory penalties of article 61, and the payment of  an indemnity equal to the value of the jewelry embezzled in case same be not finally returned,  or the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment not  to exceed  the third part of  the principal penalty, and to the payment of costs in both instances. So ordered.</p>
<p> <em>Arellano, C. J., Cooper,  Willard, Mapa,</em> and <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
