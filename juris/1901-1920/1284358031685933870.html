				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">We find no reason to disturb the findings of the trial court, particularly 
relative to the credibility of the witnesses for the prosecution, members of the 
secret service. One point only requires consideration.
<p>Counsel for appellant raises the constitutional question that the accused was 
compelled to be a witness against himself. The contention is that this was the 
result of forcing the accused to discharge the morphine from his mouth. No case 
exactly in point can be found. But, by analogy, the decision of the Supreme 
Court of the Philippine Islands in U. S. <em>vs</em>. Tan Teng ([1912] 23 Phil., 
145), following leading authorities, and the persuasive decisions of other 
courts of last resort, are conclusive. To force a prohibited drug from the 
person of an accused is along the same line as requiring him to exhibit himself 
before the court; or putting in evidence papers and other articles taken from 
the room of an accused in his absence; or, as in the Tan Teng case, taking a 
substance from the body of the accused to be used in proving his guilt. It would 
be a forced construction of the paragraph of the Philippine Bill of Rights in 
question to hold that any article, substance, or thing taken from a person 
accused of crime could not be given in evidence. The main purpose of this 
constitutional provision is to prohibit testimonial compulsion by oral 
examination in order to extort unwilling confessions from prisoners implicating 
them in the commission of a crime. (Harris <em>vs</em>. Coats [1885], 75 Ga., 
415.)</p>
<p>Following the practice of this court in cases of this character, the judgment 
of the lower court is modified by imposing the minimum penalty provided by law, 
i. e., three months imprisonment and a fine of P300 or, in case of insolvency, 
to suffer subsidiary imprisonment, with costs. (U. S.<em> vs</em>. Lim Sing, 
[1912] 23 Phil., 424; U. S. <em>vs.</em> Sy Liongco, [1915] 33 Phil., 53.) So 
ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Johnson, Carson, Araullo</em>, and <em>Street, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p></div>
