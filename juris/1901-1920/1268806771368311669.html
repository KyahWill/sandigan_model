				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of the 
Province of Bataan convicting the accused of the crime of robbery and sentencing 
him to three years eight months and one day of <em>presidio correccional,</em> 
to the accessories provided by law, to the restitution of the timber stolen or 
its value, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay half 
the costs.
<p>The information charges: "That on or about the 16th day of October, 1913, in 
the municipality of Hermosa, Province of Bataan, Philippine Islands, the accused 
[Ramon M. Velez and Andres Manluco], together with three other persons unknown, 
voluntarily, illegally, and criminally, with intent to gain, and employing force 
and intimidation, took, stole, carried away, and appropriated to their own use 
one piece of narra timber about 4 meters long and 60 centimeters thick, the 
property of Tebdoro David, which timber was in the custody and under the control 
of Sabas Fonseca, an employee of said Teodorp David, the value of said stick of 
timber being P70." </p>
<p>It is claimed in this case that the timber in question belonged to Tjeodoro 
David and that the accused committed robbery in removing it from his possession. 
We find, however, from all-the evidence in the case, that the accused has proved 
sufficient to deprive hw act of criminality. He has shown that, at the time of 
taking the timber, he in good faith believed that he was the owner thereof and 
that he took it openly and avowedly under that claim. It is law as well as 
common sense that one who takes property openly and avowedly under claim of 
title preferred in good faith it not guilty of robbery or of larceny even though 
the claim of ownership is untenable.</p>
<p>Therefore, even if, in the case before us, the accused has not shown himself 
to be the owner of the timber in question, a question we do not decide, enough 
has been presented to demonstrate good faith in his claim of ownership and that 
the taking was open and avowed. This is sufficient to deprive the taking of all 
criminality even though it eventually transpire that Teodoro David and not the 
accused was the real owner.</p>
<p>So far, however, as the record shows, it would appear that the accused has 
established a better right to the timber than the prosecuting witness. It is not 
necessary in this case, however, as we have before intimated; to determine that 
the accused was actually the owner of the property. The demonstration of good 
faith and the other elements necessary to deprive his act of criminality afford 
us sufficient basis for the reversal of the judgment.</p>
<p>The judgment of conviction is reversed and the accused acquitted; costs 
<em>de officio.</em></p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson, Carson,</em> and <em>Araullo, JJ., 
</em>concur.<br></p></div>
