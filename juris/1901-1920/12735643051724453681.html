<p align="center">FACTS.</p>
<p>During the years 1912-1915 inclusive, Pujalte &amp; Co., a general mercantile 
partnership, was engaged in the business of lumbering in Mindanao. The company 
removed from the forests and milled at its saw mills during this period, a total 
of 6,087.54 cubic meters of timber. The forest charges amounted to P8,328.93. 
Upon the execution of bonds in the aggregate sum of P2,000 to secure the payment 
of the forest charges due the government, the Collector of Internal Revenue 
permitted Pujalte &amp; Co. to remove this timber from the public forests for 
shipment by sea on saw mill invoices without prior payment. of the 
forest charges. From the timber so removed, by Pujalte &amp; Co., railroad ties 
were manufactured in its saw mills at Manila for the Manila Railroad Co. Six 
thousand three hundred and five railroad ties so manufactured were rejected by 
the Manila Railroad Co.</p>
<p>In February, 1915, the firm of Pujalte &amp; Co. was indebted to the Hongkong 
and Shanghai, Banking Corporation in a large sum of money. Being unable to pay 
its debt in specie, the company assigned to the bank, among other things, a 
large quantity of the railroad ties manufactured at its mills. The bank sold and 
disposed of these ties at various times until in May, 1916, there remained with 
it some 2,000 railroad ties of the lot acquired.</p>
<p>The internal revenue charges on the forest products removed from the public 
forests of Mindanao by Pujalte &amp; Co. not having been paid, on May 2, 1916, 
the Collector of Internal Revenue caused delinquency proceedings to be commenced 
and had issued a distress warrant. Later, on May 15, 1916, the Collector of 
Internal Revenue caused an additional distress levy to be made upon the 6,305 
ties; which it will be remembered, had been assigned by Pujalte &amp; Co. to the 
Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation. Proceeding in accordance with this 
action, the Collector of Internal Revenue seized the 2,000 ties in the 
possession of the bank. Until the date last mentioned, the bank had no notice of 
the tax.</p>
<p>Payment under protest, institution of complaint to recover back the sum paid, 
answer by the Government, trial, and judgment followed in due course. In this 
judgmenT, handed down by the Honorable James A. Ostrand, it was declared that a 
lien for taxes existed on the 2,000 railroad ties levied upon by the Collector 
of Internal Revenue and claimed as its property by the Hongkong &amp; Shanghai 
Banking Corporation, not for the full sum of P8,328.93 due as forest charges on 
the timber removed from the forests of Mindanao by Pujalte &amp; Co., but only 
for the sum of P316.43, whiclyfs the tax upon the timber used for the 
manufacture of the ties. The court ordered the Collector of Internal Revenue to 
refund to the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation the sum of P8,012.50, 
with interest at 6 per cent per annum from February 1, 1917. No costs were 
allowed. Following timely motions for a new trial, JJenial, and exceptions 
thereto, both parties have appealed.</p>
<p>This brings us to a statement of the</p>
<p align="center">LAW.</p>
<p>Among the sources of taxes, fees, and charges, in the nature of internal 
revenue taxes, the Internal Revenue Law enumerates charges for forest products. 
(Sec. 21 (<span style="font-style: italic;">f</span>), Act 2339, now sec. 1438 (f), Administrative Code of 1917.) The 
Internal Revenue Law of 1914 also contains the following provisions relative to 
the nature and extent of tax liens:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Every internal-revenue tax on property or on any business or occupation and 
every tax on resources and receipts, fd any increment to any of them incident to 
delinquency, all constitute a lien superior to all other charges or liens not 
only on the property itself upon which such tax may be imposed but also upon the 
property used in any business or occupation upon which the tax is imposed and 
upon all property rights therein.</p>
<p>"The lien of the tax on inheritances, legacies and other acquisitions <span style="font-style: italic;">mortis 
causa</span> shall have preference over any real right created thereon subsequent to 
the death of the predecessor, but this preference will be extinguished at the 
end of five years from' the date when the tax becomes payable upon real 
property, and three years upon any other kind of property." (Sec. 149, Act No. 
2339, now section 1588, Administrative Code of 1917.)</p></blockquote>
<p>The succeeding section of the same law authorizes two civil remedies for the 
collection of internal revenue taxes: (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) by distraint of personal property and 
upon exhaustion thereof by levy upon real property, and (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) by legal action. 
(Sec. 150, Act No. 2339, now section 1589, Administrative Code of 1917.) 
Relative to the first remedy by distraint of personal property, the same law in 
section 151 provides:</p>
<p>"The remedy by distraint shall proceed as follows: Upon the failure of the 
person owing any delinquent tax or delinquent revenue to pay the same, at the 
time required, the Collector of Internal Revenue or his deputy may seize and distrain any personal property belonging to such person or any property subject to the lien in sufficient quantity to satisfy the tax, or charge, together with any increment thereto incident to delinquency, and the expenses of the distraint<j distrain="" personal="" belonging="" such="" person="" property="" subject="" lien="" in="" sufficient="" quantity="" satisfy="" tax="" or="" charge="" together="" with="" any="" increment="" thereto="" incident="" to="" delinquency="" and="" expenses="" the="" distraint="" (now="" section="" 1590="" administrative="" code="" of="" 1917=""></j>." (Now section 1590, Administrative Code of 1917.)<br></p>
<p>One fact stands out prominently on examination of these provisions of the 
Internal Revenue Law—the internal revenue tax constitutes a paramount lien 
either on the property upon which the tax is imposed or on any other property 
used in any business or occupation upon which the tax is imposed. The government 
has here chosen to levy on the property itself—in the hands of a purchaser for 
value.</p>
<p>This brings us to a statement of the</p>
<p align="center">ISSUES.</p>
<p>Does the lien follow the property subject to the tax into the hands of a 
third party when at the time of transfer, no demand for payment had been made 
and when the purchaser had no notice of the existence of the lien? Counsel for 
plaintiff argues that it does not. Or, does the lien follow the property subject 
to the tax even though transferred to a third party who had no notice of the 
existence of the lien so as to make this property respond for the specific 
unpaid internal revenue taxes due on it? The trial court so found. Or, does the 
lien follow the property subject to the tax even though transferred to a third 
party who had no notice of the existence of the lien so as to make this property 
respond for all the unpaid internal revenue taxes due from the vendor? The 
government so opines.</p>
<p>This brings us to a statement of the following</p>
<p align="center">OPINION.</p>
<p>1. <em>Major Issue; Tax Liens</em>.—Taxation is an attribute of sovereignty. 
The power to tax is the strongest of all the powers of government. If 
approximate equality in taxation is tp be attained, all property subject to a 
tax must respond, or there is resultant inequality. Under the most favorable 
circumstances, an enormous amount of property escapes taxation altogether. To 
prevent such a lamentable situation, the law ordains that the claim of the State 
upon the property of the tax debtor shall be superior to that of any other 
creditor.</p>
<p>A lien in its modern acceptation is understood to denote a legal claim or 
charge on property, either real or personal, as security for. the payment of 
some debt or obligation. Its meaning is more extensive than the <span style="font-style: italic;">jus retentionis </span>
(<span style="font-style: italic;">derecho de retention</span>) of the civil law. (2 Giorgi, <span style="font-style: italic;">Teoria de las Obligaciones</span>, 
419; Ames <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Dyer, 41 Me., 397.) Unless the statute is otherwise, the rule is 
that a valid lien created on real or personal estate is enforceable against 
property in the hands of any person, other than a <span style="font-style: italic;">bona fide</span> purchaser for value 
without notice, who subsequently acquires the estate. (25 Cyc., 680, citing 
cases.)</p>
<p>The general rule of the Civil Law may be different. Possession of movables is 
not necessary to the validity of a lien, whether created by contract or by act 
of law. Such lien will attach upon movable property, even in the hands of a <span style="font-style: italic;">bona 
fide</span> purchaser without notice. (Tatham <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Andree [1863], 1 Moore, P. C. [N. 
S.], 386; <span style="font-style: italic;">The Bold Buccleugh</span> [1850], 7 Moore, P. C, 267.)</p>
<p>The law of taxation establishes principles which generally, although not 
exactly, conform to the law of liens. The tax lien does not establish itself 
upon property which has been transferred to an innocent purchaser prior to 
demand. In a decision relating to the United States Internal Revenue Law, Mr. 
Justice Miller held that a demand is necessary to create and bring the lien into 
operation. (U. S. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Pacific Railroad Co. [1877], Fed. Cas. No.15, 984; U. S. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Pacific Railroad Co. [1880], 1 Fed., 97.) Where a statute makes taxes on <span style="font-style: italic;">personal property</span> a lien thereon, a 
purchaser of such property takes the same free from any lien for taxes if the 
title passes before such a lien attaches by levy, distraint, or otherwise. 
(Shelby <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Tiddy [1896], 118 N. C., 792.)</p>
<p>In order that the lien may follow the property into the hands of a third 
party, it is further essential that the latter should have notice, either actual 
or constructive. The reason is the benevolence of our Constitution which 
prohibits the taking of property without due process of law. In the case of real 
estate or special assessment taxation a man cannot get rid of his liability to a 
"tax by buying without notice. (City of Seattle <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Kelleher [1904], 195 U. S., 
351.) The rule, however, is different where the vendee has no knowledge of the 
taxes on personalty existing at the time, or Had no means of knowing from the 
public records that such taxes had accrued.</p>
<p>The authorities relied upon by the Government will be found on examination to 
concern real estate taxation.</p>
<p>Internal revenue laws are to be construed fairly for the government and 
justly for the citizen. They should receive a liberal construction to carry out 
the purposes of their enactment; they should not receive so loose a construction 
as to permit evasions on merely fanciful and insubstantial distinctions. "The 
internal revenue laws cannot be so construed as to extend their meaning beyond 
the clear import of the words used." (U. S. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Watts [1865], Fed. Cas. No. 
16653. <span style="font-style: italic;">See</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">also</span> U. S. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Hodson [1870], 10 Wall., 395; U. S. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Kallstrom 
[1887], 30 Fed., 184; Hubbard <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Brainard [1869], 35 Conn., 563, and Mufioz 
&amp; Co. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Hord [1909], 12 Phil., 624.)</p>
<p>With such general principles in mind, we should first ascertain the 
legislative intention. One detail indicative of such intent is noted in the more 
limited scope of the law pertaining to liens for internal revenue taxes as 
contrasted with the law pertaining to liens for real estate taxes. The municipal 
law in part provides that liens for rieal property taxes "shall be enforceable 
against the property whether in the possession of the delinquent or <span style="font-style: italic;">any 
subsequent owner."</span> (Now section 364, Administrative Code of 1917.) No mention of 
the subsequent owner is found in the Internal Revenue Law. Nor does this law 
provide that the lien shall not be divested by alienation.</p>
<p>Again, we can very well look to the policy of the law in respect to liens. 
Liens, it has well been said, are of too sacred character to be impaired by 
vague and uncertain implications. The lien which the law favors is the specific 
or particular lien and not the general lien. However, the policy of the law is 
against upholding secret liens and charges against the property of innocent 
purchasers or encumbrancers for value. (<span style="font-style: italic;">See </span>Palmer <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Howard [1887], 72 Cal., 
293; 17 R. C. L., 599.)</p>
<p>Keeping the foregoing statement of facts, issues, and law before us, the 
present case offers no serious difficulty. The plaintiff was not of course 
personally liable for any part of the internal revenue taxes due the Government 
from Pujalte &amp; Co. On the date the railroad ties were transferred from 
Pujalte &amp; Co. to the Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation no demand 
for payment of the tax had been made. The bonds in favor of the Government were 
still presumably subsisting. No demand in fact was made until over a year later 
when distraint proceedings were initiated. When the Hongkong &amp; Shanghai 
Banking Corporation purchased and acquired these 2,000 ties in February, 1915, 
there was nothing to show that Pujalte &amp; Co. were delinquent tax payers. No 
public record could be consulted to protect the purchaser from loss by reason of 
the existence of a secret lien. A businessman of ordinary prudence could not be 
expected to foresee that the personal property which he had taken in 
satisfaction of a debt was burdened by a tax. On this date, because no demand 
had been made and because the plaintiff had no notice of the tax, there was no 
valid subsisting lien upon the ties.</p>
<p>2. <em>Minor Issue; Interest upon Judgments to Recover 
Taxes</em>.—Plaintiff-appellant in assignment of error No. 4 also claims 
interest upon the amount of the judgment from the 3d day of June, 1916, in place 
and instead of allowing interest thereon from the first day of February, 1917. 
The first date is that of the illegal exaction; the second date is that of the 
commencement of the action. Interest should be allowed from the day when the 
taxpayer lost the income from the funds by payment under protest, or not at all. 
(Viuda e Hijos de Pedro P. Roxas <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Rafferty [1918], 37 Phil., 957; H. E. 
Heacock Co. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Collector of Customs [1918], 37 Phil., 970.)</p>
<p>On the other hand, the second assignment of error of the defendant-appellant 
is to the effect that no interest at all should have been allowed by the trial 
court because of section 1579 of the present Administrative Code. 
Plaintiff-appellant in answer challenges the validity of this section.</p>
<p>Section 1579 of the Administrative Code of 1917 in part authorizes the 
taxpayer who has paid an internal revenue tax under protest, at any time within 
two years after the payment of the tax, "to bring an action against the 
Collector of Internal Revenue for the recovery <span style="font-style: italic;">without interest</span> of the sum 
alleged to have been illegally collected." As this provision was enacted by the 
Philippine Legislature subsequent to the institution of the present action in 
the lower court, and subsequent to the judgment therein rendered, we do not feel 
that the law should be given a retroactive effect. Whether section 1579 of the 
Administrative Code is valid or not is left for decision when a case arises 
after the Code became effective. In this instance, we allow interest at the 
legal rate from the date of payment.</p>
<p>3. <em>Minor Issue; Costs Against the Government</em>.—Plaintiff-appellant 
further claims that the trial court erred in declining to allow the recovery of 
costs.</p>
<p>The right to recover costs is governed by statute. In the United States, the 
rule is that unless expressly authorized by statute, a judgment for costs, 
either in a civil or a criminal case, cannot be rendered against the United 
States or a State. The principle is that the sovereign power is not amenable to 
judgments for damages or costs without its consent. (U. S. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Barker [1817], 2 
Wheat., 395; Stanley <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Schwalby [1896], 162 XL S., 255; State <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Williams 
[1905], 101 Md., 529; 4 A. &amp; E. Ann. Cas., 970; Deneen <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Unverzagt [1907], 
225 111., 378; 8 A. &amp; E. Ann. Cas., 396 and note; Townsend's Succession 
[1888], 40 La. Ann., 66.)</p>
<p>The Code of Civil Procedure of the Philippine Islands provides that costs 
shall ordinarily follow the result of the suit. They are to be recovered by "the 
prevailing party." (Code of Civil Procedure, chapter 21.) In the ordinary case 
between private individuals or entities, or where the government is successful, 
no particular difficulty is experienced in applying the Code provisions. The 
practice has, however, been not to allow costs in cases in which the Government 
of the Philippine Islands or a nominal representative of the Government is the 
unsuccessful party. And this is right—for the Government of the Philippine 
Islands is sovereign in the sense that a State of the American Union or Porto 
Rico is sovereign, and this paramount power has not by statute permitted itself 
to be taxed with costs.</p>
<p>No costs should be allowed plaintiff in either instance.</p>
<p>This brings us to a statement of the</p>
<p align="center">JUDGMENT.</p>
<p>Judgment is reversed and the plaintiff shall have and recover from defendant 
the full amount sued for, P8,328.93, with interest at the legal rate from June 
3, 1916, until paid, and without costs in either instance. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Johnson, Carson</em>, and <em>Araullo, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="center">

<p align="center"><em><strong>DISSENTING AND CONCURRING OPINION</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>STREET, J.</strong>, <em>dissenting</em> and <em>concurring</em> in 
part:</p>
<p>The lien created by law for the enforcement of the tax on land is expressly 
declared to be enforcible against the property in the hands of any person, 
whether the delinquent or any subsequent owner. (<span style="font-style: italic;">See</span> sec. 364, Administrative 
Code, 1917; section 2497, id., for city of Manila.) On the other hand, that 
section of the Internal Revenue Law which declares a lien for internal-revenue 
taxes merely says that such lien shall be superior to all other charges or 
liens. (Sec. 1588, Administrative Code, 1917.) From this it can be fairly, 
though not, I think, conclusively argued that the lien for the enforcement of 
internal revenue taxes was not intended to be effective against subsequent 
owners. Acceding to the force of this argument, I should perhaps have yielded my 
own views and expressed my conformity with the decision upon this as upon other 
points involved in the case. Nevertheless I cannot refrain from expressing my 
regret that the court should have reached the conclusion it has announced with 
respect to the lien declared in section 1588 of the Code, and it is my opinion 
that the lien created in this section has the same effect and range as the lien 
which is created in support of the land tax.</p>
<p>The obvious effect of the decision on the point in question is to destroy the 
practical utility of the lien created by section 1588; because so long as the 
property subject to the tax is in the hands of the person primarily liable for 
the tax, it can be seized by the Collector of Internal Revenue under process of 
distraint and thus subjected to the payment of the tax (section 1690, 
Administrative Code, 1916). No lien is therefore necessary to enable the 
government to take the property and enforce its rights as. against him. It is 
only when the property passes into the hands of some other person than the one 
primarily liable that the existence of a lien becomes of any importance.</p>
<p>It is inherent in the nature of a lien, as a real obligation fixed on the 
property, that it should remain as a burden thereon regardless of mutations in 
the ownership; and a lien, like this, created by express provision of law and 
made superior to all other charges and liens, necessarily continues to subsist 
regardless of whether the subsequent owner or purchaser of the property has 
notice of the lien or not. I am not convinced by the citation of the American 
authorities, referred to in the opinion of the Court, and I think that the 
deductions drawn by the Court from those cases is unwarranted. It is well known 
that mere equitable liens, as recognized in American jurisprudence, are not 
enforcible against purchasers without notice; but this doctrine I consider to be 
inapplicable to a statutory lien, such as is involved in this case.</p>
<p>The possibility of the existence of some hidden lien like this was recognized 
by the Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank at the time it bought these rails, for the 
very contract of transfer, or assignment, by which it acquired the property 
contains a provision whereby Pujalte &amp; Company warranted that, at the date 
of the transfer, the rails were the absolute property of that company and were 
"free and clear of any liens, charges, and encumbrances," arid warranted the 
title against all lawful claims of all persons whomsoever. It is obvious that 
Pujalte &amp; Company would be liable upon this warranty, if the lien should be 
enforced; and I think this the simplest solution that can be made of the 
case.</p>
<p>I am, therefore, constrained to express my disagreement with the conclusion 
of the court with respect to the liability of the rails in question for the tax 
due upon them; and I think that the trial court committed no error in refusing a 
refund of the amount thereof (P316.43). Upon other points I concur.</p></div>
