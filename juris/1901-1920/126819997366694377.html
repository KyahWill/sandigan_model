				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. SOFRONIO DE LA CRUZ, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Sofronio de la Cruz was charged with having threatened Dolores Coronel in a 
letter with death or the burning of her house unless she gave him P500, which 
she must deposit in the place indicated to her in the letter. This letter was 
found by Rafaela Coronel, who was living with Dolores, in the fence around her 
house, and as she was then on her way to church she turned it over to her 
neighbor Agustin Coronel, who read its contents to Dolores Coronel, an old woman 
of 70 years, who became nervous and uneasy upon seeing herself thus threatened. 
Tito Coronel reported the matter to the municipal president of Guagua, Pampanga, 
who went to Dolores' house and adopted some precautionary measures. Upon 
returning to the town hall he found a man held under arrest by the Constabulary. 
He had him searched to see whether he was carrying any prohibited thing and 
there was found upon him an envelope inside a pocketbook, and upon the envelope 
was written the name of Dolores Coronel. The man under arrest was Sofronio de la 
Cruz.
<p>The letter with its envelope, found in the fence around the house, forms 
Exhibit A. The envelope found in the pocketbook, Exhibit B.</p>
<p>On this envelope (Exhibit B) the name written is "Dolores Cronel" and the 
letter and envelope (Exhibit A) also set forth the same name, "Dolores Cronel." 
It is sufficient to compare the nature of the handwriting of the name "Dolores 
Cronel" on the envelope (Exhibit B) with that of the same writing used in the 
letter (Exhibit A) in order to appreciate at a glance their complete 
similarity.</p>
<p>Sofronio de la Cruz had been arrested by the Constabulary and taken to the 
town hall for a similar letter, addressed, apparently, to one Andres Valenzuela 
of the same neighborhood of Guagua, which has been brought into this case as 
Exhibit C. A glance at it corroborates the idea that both letters were written 
by the same hand.</p>
<p>Sofronio de la Cruz says that Tito Coronel wrote the name "Dolores Cronel" 
that appears on the envelope found on him; but Tito Coronel was made to write a 
name in court for comparing his handwriting, and it is evident that this is not 
at all like that of any of the letters that figure as exhibits in the case.</p>
<p>In connection with this phase of the defense the defendant presented the 
witness Florentino Nacu to demonstrate that the old woman Dolores Coronel had 
been in his house, accompanied by Tito Coronel, for the purpose of talking about 
plowpoints with the defendant, and that the latter made a note of her name in 
order to know her address, and Tito Coronel wrote the name "Dolores Cronel" on 
the envelope (Exhibit B); that the defendant remained iii Florentino Nacu's 
house until Good Friday (on which day the letter addressed to Dolores Coronel 
was found); that he was in said house to collect from Nacu what the latter owed 
him; that on the Wednesday previous he had urged Nacu to get some money because 
he needed it badly. Florentino Nacu testified in agreement, but to all this said 
that while the old woman Dolores and the defendant were talking about plowpoints 
he was in the kitchen cooking the food for his family and gave his attention to 
that, although he was moving in and out where Dolores and Tito Coronel were 
talking with the defendant, but still he did not affirm that he had seen Tito 
Coronel write on the envelope thathe handed the defendant. Tito Coronel totally 
denies all the assertions of the defendant and his witness Nacu.</p>
<p>The Court of First Instance of Pampanga sentenced the defendant, as guilty of 
threats, under article 494 of the Penal Code, to four years two months and one 
day of <em>prision correccional,</em> the accessories of the law, with credit 
for half the time of detention suffered, and to payment of the costs.</p>
<p>The first ground of error assigned to us is the denial of the motion for 
dismissal presented by the defense after the evidence for the prosecution had 
been closed and before that for the defense had been begun, the motion being 
based upon lack of evidence.</p>
<p>The Attorney-General in this instance alleges that the question has already 
been determined by this Supreme Court in a negative sense in the case of the 
United States <em>vs.</em> Abaroa (3 Phil. Rep., 116), wherein the following 
principle was laid down: "After the prosecution rests, the court should not 
dismiss the case on motion for insufficiency of proof but should require the 
defendant to present evidence on his own behalf."</p>
<p>This is true. But this decision was rendered on December 29, 1903, when, in 
conformity with General Order No. 58, it was possible to appeal from dismissals 
and final judgments. It was then held that the practice of dismissing the case 
immediately after the evidence for the prosecution had been closed ought not to 
be followed, for when the order of dismissal was appealed from and this higher 
court sustained the conviction of the accused on that evidence of the 
prosecution he would have been convicted without having been heard in his own 
defense, which would work an injustice; and when to avoid this difficulty the 
order of dismissal was overruled and the case returned for rehearing, another 
difficulty would be encountered, which is that of subjecting the accused a 
second time to another trial without action on his part and without need, since 
all the evidence could and should have been taken at the trial already held, and 
with the additional risk of all the inconveniences of delay. In this state of 
affairs the Supreme Court of the United States rendered the decision in the case 
of Kepner <em>vs.</em> U. S. (195 U. S., 100; 11 Phil. Rep., 669), and since 
then the situation assumed and disposed of in United States vs. Abaroa cannot be 
considered, for the Government cannot now appeal from an order sustaining the 
motion to dismiss presented by the defense after the evidence for the 
prosecution has been closed, on the ground of insufficiency thereof.</p>
<p>Even now, after the Kepner case, it is no ground for error that the Court of 
First Instance denied the motion for dismissal presented immediately after the 
evidence for the prosecution had been closed because the defense believed it to 
be insufficient; for the reason that, as in this case, the court did not hold it 
to be insufficient—it was under no obligation so to hold it—and it could 
continue the trial and take the evidence for the defense in order to reach the 
conclusion induced, in its opinion by the allegations and the evidence, or as it 
did conclude in this case by sentencing the defendant on the evidence for the 
prosecution, which it held to be sufficient. </p>
<p>And it is quite sufficient, as the trial court has held, even taking into 
consideration only the exhibits. </p>
<p>One of the methods of proving the authenticity of a writing is collation, the 
comparison the court can make with other writings proven to its satisfaction to 
be authentic. The trial court held to be proven to its satisfaction as authentic 
the writing by the defendant (Exhibit B) that was found inside the pocketbook. 
The defendant tried to ascribe the writing to another—to Tito Coronel:—and his 
counsel tested Tito Coronel by having him write in the court room what he 
dictated to him. He directed him to write the name of a person and of a place as 
the address of a letter, and it plainly appears that neither the free 
handwriting of the letter nor the firmness of the strokes of the writing is at 
all like the somewhat rough and uncertain form, as of a beginner, of the writing 
and strokes in Exhibit B and the anonymous Exhibits A and C. These are signed in 
the same way with a "Pulano Tal" so similar that it seems to be one signature 
traced over the other. Moreover, Tito Coronel, said to be an intimate of the old 
woman Dolores Coronel, if he had really written her name in order thus to give 
the defendant a definite post-office address, when he knew so well how to write, 
as he demonstrated, would not have written Dolores <em>Cronel,</em> as it 
appears in Exhibits A and B. Furthermore, the initial <em>"D"</em> of the name 
<em>Dolores</em> and the same unusual way of writing the "D" in the Exhibits A 
and C is not the "D" written by Tito Coronel in the word "Dumaguete," which he 
was made to write. The attempt to ascribe to Tito Coronel the writing of the 
name that appears in Exhibit B was frustrated. "I wish to prove," said the 
witness Pedro Bacani, municipal president, "that the witness Tito Coronel is an 
influential man, and not, as the defense is trying, to prove indirectly that it 
was Tito Coronel who wrote the letter." The defense: "From the moment we 
presented him as a witness, we ceased to suspect him. We admit that Tito Coronel 
is an influential man." (p. 50.) </p>
<p>The trial court having held that the anonymous threat (Exhibit A) was written 
by the defendant, and there being no ground for the contrary, the legitimate 
conclusion from the facts is to sustain such finding, which is certainly 
corroborated by the other data furnished by the witness Florentino Nacu 
regarding the presence in Guagua of the defendant, who was a resident of Angat, 
Bulacan.</p>
<p>The conclusion in law therefore is for the guilt of the defendant, who is 
guilty of the crime penalized in paragraph one of article 494 of the Penal Code; 
and there must be imposed upon him the penalty lower by two degrees than that 
fixed by the law for the crime he threatened to commit. For having made the 
threat and demanding a sum of money, even though he did not obtain it, the 
penalty should be in the maximum degree, however, as he made the threat in 
writing. The penalty fixed by the law for the crime Tie threatened to commit, 
which is homicide, is <em>reclusion temporal </em>(art. 404), so the lower by 
two degrees, according to scale No. 2, is <em>prision correccional,</em> which 
in its maximum degree is four years two months and one day to six years. The 
penalty of four years two months and one day of <em>prision correccional</em> in 
the judgment appealed from being in this degree and the imposition of the 
accessories of the law and the allowance of half of the time of detention 
suffered and the payment of the costs all being proper, said judgment is 
affirmed, with the costs of this instance.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Johnson, Carson,</em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em>Moreland, J.,</em> concurs in the result.<br></p></div>
