				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. ANTONIO TURLA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal interposed by the accused Antonio Turla from a judgment of 
the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija, whereby he is found guilty of the 
crime of robbery in a band and is sentenced, in accordance with articles 508 and 
509 of the Penal Code, to suffer the penalty of thirteen years nine months and 
eleven days of <em>cadena temporal</em>, with the accessory penalties, and to 
the restitution of the objects taken or of their value.
<p>In the judgment appealed from, the judge found the following facts 
proved:</p>
<p>"First. That in or about the month of September, 1916, Estanislao Cuevas 
possessed in the barrio of Santo Tomas, municipality of Penaranda, Province of 
Nueva Ecija, a house occupied by himself and his family.</p>
<p>"Second. That on the night of September 23, 1916, four malefactors armed with 
revolvers and bolos went up into the said house of Estanislao Cuevas, while some 
remained below; and after having ordered, by means of intimidation, all those 
who lived in the house to fie with their faces down, they took away and broke 
open a trunk, appropriating to themselves, with intent of gain and against the 
will of the owners, all the money and jewels therein contained which belonged to 
Antonina Cuevas, fourteen cock-spurs (<em>navajas de gallo</em>) belonging to 
Estanislao Cuevas, and a bolo owned by Meliton Tabada.</p>
<p>"Third. That two members of that family, named Julio Padilla and Antonia 
Cuevas, recognized the accused. Antonio Turla as one of these assailants.</p>
<p>"Fourth. That the money, jewels, and other objects taken from the house in 
question, the total value of which amounted to P253, have not been 
recovered."</p>
<p>The evidence adduced during the trial fully establishes the facts which the 
court considers proved. The only attempted defense was that of alibi, which in 
our opinion has not been proved; so that the guilt of the accused as one of the 
principals of the crime prosecuted is beyond doubt.</p>
<p>Therefore the criminal act which is the subject matter of these proceedings 
presents the elements of the crime of robbery in a band, committed by four armed 
malefactors, of objects the value of which is estimated at P253, a crime 
provided for and penalized by articles 502 and 503, No. 5, in connection with 
article 504 of the Penal Code. Furthermore, as the robbery was committed in an 
inhabited house and accompanied by the breaking open of a locked piece of 
furniture and the value of the property taken exceeded 1,250 <em>pesetas</em>, 
and considering that in the perpetration of the crime the robbers used 
intimidation upon the person of the injured parties, it is held in the present 
case that, following the application of the articles of the Penal Code referring 
to robbery, the doctrine laid down by this court in various decisions which are 
now considered as authorities, this robbery should be penalized in accordance 
with the tenor of paragraph 5 of the above-mentioned article 503 of the said 
Code, being further in harmony with the doctrine laid down by the supreme court 
of Spain in deciding cases appealed in cassation, wherein it has been held that, 
there being violence against or intimidation upon persons, article 516, No. 5, 
of the Penal Code of Spain should be applied, which is the same as article 503, 
No. 5, of the Code in force in these Islands and which in return is the same 
Spanish Penal Code of 1870, amended and promulgated in these Islands in 1887, 
although the robbery has been committed in an inhabited house and accompanied by 
the breaking of trunks and wardrobes ; inasmuch as the circumstance of the use 
of violence against or intimidation upon the persons places the case under the 
provisions of the said article 503, No. 5, and not those of article 508 which is 
the same as 521 of the Penal Code of Spain. (Decisions of December 26, 1870, 
October 10, 1871, and June 11, 1872.)</p>
<p>The fact that the crime was committed in the dwelling of the offended party, 
Estanislao Cuevas, should be considered as a generic aggravating circumstance, 
the same as nocturnity, there being no extenuanting circumstance, to counteract 
the effects of the said aggravating ones.</p>
<p>In view of the above statements it follows that the judgment appealed from 
should be reversed and the accused Antonio Turla should be sentenced, as we 
hereby sentence him to the penalty of ten years of <em>presidio mayor</em>, with 
the accessories prescribed in article 57 of the Code; to restore to the offended 
party the objects appropriated by him or pay the value thereof, P253, without 
subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, in accordance with article 51 of 
the same Code; and to the payment of the costs of both instances. So 
ordered.</p>
<p><em>Carson, Street, Malcolm, Avance√±a</em>, and <em>Fisher. JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p></div>
