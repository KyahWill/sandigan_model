				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. BLAS MORO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The guilt of the accused of the crime&nbsp; of arson of which he was convicted is conclusively established by the testimony&nbsp; of the witnesses for the prosecution, if that testimony&nbsp; be worthy of belief.&nbsp; There are&nbsp; certain matters in the record which tend to disclose the possibility that these witnesses may have&nbsp; been procured to testify falsely by&nbsp; the complaining witness, a Chinese, whose house was&nbsp; burned, but there is nothing in the record upon which this&nbsp; court could base a finding to that effect or that the testimony of these witnesses is in fact&nbsp; untrue.&nbsp; The court below must have&nbsp; been fully aware of&nbsp; the possibility of the existence of a conspiracy between the complaining witness and others to establish the theory of the prosecution, that the defendant,&nbsp; a mere boy, burned the&nbsp; building of the complaining witness at the instigation&nbsp; of another Chinese,&nbsp; an enemy of the Chinese whose building was destroyed, and yet&nbsp; the trial judge was of opinion, after hearing these&nbsp; witnesses testify,&nbsp; that&nbsp; their&nbsp; testimony was&nbsp; worthy&nbsp; of belief, and established the guilt of the&nbsp; accused&nbsp; beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; We can not say that the record does not sustain the finding of&nbsp; fact by the trial judge, and we find no errors in the proceedings prejudicial to the rights of the accused.<br><br>The trial court in imposing the penalty took&nbsp; into consideration the race and lack of mental and moral instruction of&nbsp; the accused as an extenuating circumstance, under the provisions of article 11 of the Penal&nbsp; Code, for the purpose&nbsp; of compensating the aggravating circumstance of nocturnity.&nbsp; The Attorney-General, in his brief upon&nbsp; appeal, contends that the crime being one "against property," the convict should not be given the benefit of the provisions of article 11, and supports his contention by citing the decisions&nbsp; of this court in the&nbsp; cases&nbsp; of&nbsp; The United States <i>vs. </i>Villanueva (9 Phil. Rep., 94), The United States <i>vs</i>. Pascual (9 Phil. Rep.,&nbsp; 491),&nbsp; and The United States <i>vs</i>. Cortes (12 Phil. Rep., 309) ; but while it is true that this court has uniformly declined to apply the provisions of article 11 so as to secure to a convict the benefit&nbsp; of the extenuating circumstance of race in cases of simple robbery, and generally in cases of&nbsp; robbery, theft, and estafa, so that it&nbsp; may be said that as a&nbsp; general&nbsp; rule the&nbsp; provisions of this article should not be applied in cases of ""crimes against property" of this class, yet the rule should not be extended&nbsp; further, and in each case where&nbsp; the defendant&nbsp; has been convicted of one of the many other&nbsp; classes of crimes against property, it is the duty of the court, in the exercise of its sound discretion, to apply or to refrain from the application of the provisions of this article with due regard to the particular circumstances of the case under consideration.<br><br>The judgment of conviction and the sentence imposed by the trial court&nbsp; should&nbsp; be affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Moreland,</i> and <i>Elliott, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
