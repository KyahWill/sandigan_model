				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This case has&nbsp; been brought up for a review&nbsp; of the judgment dated October 8, 1914, whereby the Honorable Higinio Benitez found Lamberto Antonio guilty of the complex crime of robbery with quadruple homicide and sentenced&nbsp; him to the penalty of death, with the&nbsp; accessories&nbsp; of article 53 of the Code,&nbsp; an&nbsp; indemnity of&nbsp; P5,000 to&nbsp; the surviving&nbsp; girl, Consolacion Dagojoy, or her legal guardian, and payment of one-half of the costs; and acquitted Eulogio Bait (<span style="font-style: italic;">alias </span>Oloy), with his share of the costs <span style="font-style: italic;">de officio,</span>&nbsp; ordering his immediate&nbsp; release.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">FACTS OF THE CASE.<br></div><br>Late on the afternoon of June 9,1914, Lamberto Antonio (alias&nbsp; Bitong) accompanied by his&nbsp; brothers&nbsp; called Bado and Martiniano and&nbsp; by another individual who&nbsp; proved to be Eulogio Bait&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">alias </span>Oloy)&nbsp; entered the house&nbsp; of Feliciano Dagojoy situated in the place&nbsp; called&nbsp; Catuguesan&nbsp; of&nbsp; the barrio of Valderrama, municipality of Culasi,&nbsp; Province of Antique.&nbsp; As&nbsp; night had already fallen these four individuals asked for&nbsp; lodging&nbsp; in&nbsp; the house the&nbsp; owner whereof is the brother-in-law of Lamberto who is married to. Isabel Dagojoy,&nbsp; sister of the householder Feliciano.&nbsp; They&nbsp; then had supper therein with Feliciano Dagojoy and his wife, Matea Gante; and while the spouses Feliciano and Matea after supper were engaged in shelling corn, and while the said Lamberto Antonio&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">alias </span>Bitong)&nbsp; and Bado were still awake,&nbsp; the boy Martiniano, about 12 years&nbsp; of age, and Eulogio (<span style="font-style: italic;">alias </span>Oloy), being worn out with fatigue, went to sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp; But in the small hours of the night&nbsp; or early the next morning Eulogio awoke and saw his companions Lamberto&nbsp; and Bado&nbsp; standing up, blood-stained&nbsp; bolos&nbsp; in hand, and in the front room&nbsp; of the house Feliciano Dagojoy and his son of tender age, called Fortunato, dead.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the bedroom Matea Gante and her daughter Teopista were also dead, and the girl Consolacion wounded was stretched out between her mother and her sister Teopista&nbsp; so that&nbsp; she was taken for dead.&nbsp; Thereupon Bado and&nbsp; Bitong forced open two&nbsp; trunks&nbsp; that were in the&nbsp; house,&nbsp; and also&nbsp; two bamboo money boxes, the&nbsp; cash&nbsp; wherein they seized,&nbsp; as well as the clothing in the trunk, putting it in a palm-leaf sack. Then they&nbsp; went&nbsp; away, taking the trunks and one of the bamboo money boxes which they later left in the road.&nbsp; Oloy thereupon awoke&nbsp; Martiniano and they&nbsp; also went away.&nbsp; The two first-named kept the money, clothing, and other&nbsp; effects belonging to the deceased spouses who, on the previous afternoon, had hospitably received them as persons known and trusted.<br><br>The house&nbsp; with the&nbsp; four&nbsp; corpses&nbsp; and the&nbsp; severely wounded girl&nbsp; Consolacion remained abandoned until the next afternoon, June 10, when Macaria Tañongon, mother of the deceased Matea Gante, went to her daughter's house to see her, and upon making her way inside found&nbsp; said four corpses and&nbsp; also the girl Gonsolacion, about&nbsp; 5 years of age, who was still alive despite her various&nbsp; wounds and was then&nbsp; asking&nbsp; for&nbsp; a drink of&nbsp; water; Macaria having picked her up, took her along and forthwith reported the matter to the&nbsp; local authorities.&nbsp; It is worthy of note that when Macaria Tanongon&nbsp; was in the house where the crime occurred, Lamberto Antonio (<span style="font-style: italic;">alias </span>Bitong)&nbsp; called&nbsp; to her from some&nbsp; distance asking if there were any wounded persons in the house,&nbsp; to which she replied affirmatively, saying that the little girl Consolacion was wounded,&nbsp; and that thereupon Lamberto, without approaching the house where Macaria Tanongon was and&nbsp; without having ascertained the reason for the occurrence, went toward his own.<br><br>On the same date, June 10, when&nbsp; the Constabulary lieutenant Tañedo and various policemen attempted to arrest the so-called Bado, he started to run, whereupon&nbsp; he&nbsp; was shot dead.<br><br>For the purpose of making the proper investigation, the justice of the peace of Culasi went on the night of the&nbsp; said date, June 10 of the year&nbsp; just past, to the house of the deceased persons, which&nbsp; was composed of three compartments—that is, front room, bedroom, and kitchen—its floor being raised three spans above the&nbsp; ground.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the front room was found the boy Fortunato Dagojoy with one wound in his chest from which a portion of his lungs protruded, two wounds in his back, and two more at his waist.&nbsp; Near him&nbsp; was found the corpse of Feliciano Dago joy,&nbsp; stretched out face downwards, with one wound in&nbsp; his left side, another at the base of his left arm toward his back, another in the same arm&nbsp; extending to the&nbsp; bone, and another at the back of his head so that his neck was almost severed. In the bedroom of the house was found the corpse of the woman&nbsp; Matea&nbsp; Gante with one wound on the left&nbsp; side of her neck, which was almost severed, another on the upper part of her ear, another&nbsp; on the left side&nbsp; of her head,&nbsp; and another in her right forearm—it being worthy of note that the wound in her neck showed signs of having been inflicted by three different blows the nicks from which showed on the&nbsp; bone.&nbsp; Near this corpse was likewise found that of Teopista Dagojoy, a girl of about 8 years of age, with a wound at the base of her left arm, which was severed, and two wounds, almost together, in her head.&nbsp; There&nbsp; was also&nbsp; found&nbsp; in the house an empty bamboo money box with its opening bloodstained.<br><br>The surviving&nbsp; girl Consolacion Dagojoy was&nbsp; found to have one wound in her left arm, another at the base of the same, another in her left shoulder, another in her left side, and the fifth in her left leg; all&nbsp; of these&nbsp; wounds were cured by July 20 following, through the ministration of the physician Doctor Asuncion.<br><br>The facts&nbsp; set forth were fully proved at the trial, not only by the testimony of the girl Consolacion about 5 years of&nbsp; age, the sole survivor of&nbsp; the slaughter&nbsp; of which her parents and her minor-brother and&nbsp; sister were the victims, and by the testimony of the boy Martiniano, 12 years of age, who had&nbsp; accompanied the&nbsp; murderers&nbsp; (all of&nbsp; which statements are corroborated by another one of their companions, Eulogio Oloy, the defendant acquitted in this case), but also by&nbsp; the result&nbsp; of&nbsp; the investigation made&nbsp; by the justice&nbsp; of the peace of Culasi on the night following the one when said crimes were committed; which facts served to confirm the statement of Macaria&nbsp; Tanoñgon, mother of the deceased Matea Gante, who was the first to go to and to discover in the afternoon of that date, June 10, in her daughter's house the corpses of her daughter,&nbsp; her son-in-law Feliciano Dagojoy,&nbsp; and her minor grandchildren Teopista&nbsp; and&nbsp; Fortunato Dagojoy,. with various severe&nbsp; and fatal wounds, as well as to find the 5-year-old girl, Consolacion&nbsp; Dagojoy, with five wounds,&nbsp; stretched out on the floor&nbsp; beside her mother's corpse.<br><br>After perpetrating this crime&nbsp; in a savage and ruthless manner, without the least pity upon&nbsp; near relatives&nbsp; of the wife of one of the&nbsp; malefactors, Lamberto Antonio, brother- in-law of the unfortunate Feliciano Dagojoy, they proceeded to carry out&nbsp; the&nbsp; criminal purpose they had&nbsp; formed by breaking open two trunks and&nbsp; two bamboo money boxes wherein the deceased spouses had kept their scanty savings and by&nbsp; taking possession of the money in those boxes and of the&nbsp; trunks&nbsp; that held their clothes, which&nbsp; articles of furniture were thrown&nbsp; away&nbsp; in the&nbsp; road after they had taken possession of the effects and the clothes therein by putting them in a&nbsp; palm-leaf sack.<br><br>The facts stated&nbsp; undoubtedly constitute the complex crime of robbery with quadruple&nbsp; homicide and lesiones graves, provided for and&nbsp; penalized in articles 502 and&nbsp; 503, No. 1 of the Penal Code, for with the undeniable intention&nbsp; of stealing and&nbsp; taking possession of the money, clothes, and other effects&nbsp; belonging to the&nbsp; spouses Dagojoy and Gante, the defendant Lamberto and his&nbsp; brother 6ad6, now dead, attacked and killed&nbsp; the owners&nbsp; of the house and their children, excepting one girl who, through mere accident and notwithstanding the&nbsp; number and severity of her wounds, did not die, but was pronounced cured after forty-one days of treatment.<br><br>In order to accomplish the definite act of robbery of the money, clothes, and effects in the&nbsp; house they had to get rid of and kill all of&nbsp; its inmates who,&nbsp; if they could&nbsp; not offer resistence, might at least see and witness that violation&nbsp; of property rights; consequently&nbsp; it cannot be denied that the complex crime&nbsp; under prosecution was consummated.<br><br>The robbery was perfectly proven by the statements&nbsp; of the robbers' two companions, Eulogio and&nbsp; Martiniano (the latter their brother), by the finding of the trunks and one of the money boxes&nbsp; empty in the road outside the&nbsp; house robbed,&nbsp; by the finding of the other money&nbsp; box, also empty, inside the same house, and likewise by the finding of clothing, worn both by&nbsp; the two dead spouses as well as by their children, and the personal cedulas of the husband Dagojoy in the house of the so-called Bad6, one of the murderers, after he had been killed in attempting to escape.&nbsp; Moreover. there is evidence&nbsp; in&nbsp; the case tending to show&nbsp; that the defendant Lamberto&nbsp; owed various sums to his brother-in- law, the deceased&nbsp; Dagojoy, but as it does not appear that trouble&nbsp; and ill&nbsp; will existed between the two—for the Dagojoy spouses&nbsp; received the robbers with&nbsp; amiability and pleasure that night some hours before&nbsp; the commission&nbsp; of the horrible crimes, furnishing them supper and even lodging in their house—there is no ground for&nbsp; the presumption that the defendant Lamberto&nbsp; and&nbsp; his&nbsp; brother proceeded to kill the Dagojoy couple and their children for the sole purpose of avoiding&nbsp; the payment of Lamberto's debt, nor are there any data in the case from which it can be asserted that they acted on the impulse of any feeling of resentment or revenge.&nbsp; Therefore it must be held that the murderers,&nbsp; Lamberto and Bad6, killed said couple and two of their children with unusual cruelty for&nbsp; the sole purpose of robbing them and of taking whatever they possessed, consequently the facts under consideration must be classified as robbery with homicide.<br><br>The defendant at bar, Lamberto Antonio (alias Bitong) pleaded not guilty and set up an&nbsp; alibi, which was not absolutely proved, for his only witness, who is his wife Isabel Dagojoy, was not called to the stand.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is easily explained by the fact that she is a sister of the deceased Feliciano Dagojoy, and, aside from the fact that the defendant Lamberto lived in the&nbsp; place where&nbsp; the crime occurred and near the house robbed, it would not have been impossible for him to have committed it during a brief absence from his house.&nbsp; To this effect his companions Eulogio and Martiniano state in their testimony that they assembled in Lamberto's house to go over to the house robbed, and that after the crimes had been&nbsp; committed Lamberto returned to his house, not very&nbsp; far from&nbsp; there, while&nbsp; Bado&nbsp; and his two companions went&nbsp; back to their home&nbsp; on Mount Lacauon.&nbsp; The case, therefore, affords conclusive evidence that Lamberto Antonio&nbsp; directly participated not only in causing the violent deaths of the Dagojoy couple and two of their children, as well as the serious wounds of the little girl Consolacion,&nbsp; (for the&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; in&nbsp; order to make sure whether she was dead or alive even pinched her nose before leaving&nbsp; the house robbed, as appears from the trial) but also in the robbery that has been described.<br><br>In the commission of said crime of robbery with quadruple homicide various aggravating circumstances defined in article 10&nbsp; of the Penal Code&nbsp; must be held to have concurred:&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 1, because the defendant&nbsp; Lamberto was the brother-in-law&nbsp; of the deceased Feliciano Dagojoy; No. 10, because there was abuse&nbsp; of the confidence that said couple undoubtedly&nbsp; reposed in him as a near relative;&nbsp; No. 20, because the crime&nbsp; was committed&nbsp; in the dwelling of the victims; No. 15, because it was committed at night and by taking advantage of the time when the victims were tired and sleepy; and No. 2, because the deed was committed with treachery, which circumstance is held to include the abuse of superior&nbsp; force.&nbsp; The circumstance of treachery in the killing of the two children Teopista&nbsp; and&nbsp; Fortunato is found to exist because, whether they were awake or asleep at the moment of the crime, the killing of a child&nbsp; of tender age, defenseless and&nbsp; unprotected, must&nbsp; always be classified as murder.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even&nbsp; though the deceased&nbsp; children&nbsp; had&nbsp; been awake they could not have defended themselves or have fled or&nbsp; escaped&nbsp; from the attack of their assailants.&nbsp; As for the violent deaths of the spouses Dagojoy and Gante, in view of the&nbsp; location and nature of their wounds the presumption is that they were attacked treacherously and without risk while they were lying down&nbsp; and&nbsp; asleep so that they could not have defended themselves&nbsp; or escape from the attack&nbsp; of which they were the&nbsp; victims.&nbsp; This circumstance of treachery, when it concurs in the crime of homicide,&nbsp; fixes the classification as murder; but when it concurs in the complex crime of robbery&nbsp; with homicide it is only to be regarded as a generic aggravating circumstance, for this is a case of&nbsp; a&nbsp; complex&nbsp; crime which has its&nbsp; own definition&nbsp; and&nbsp; special&nbsp; penalty in&nbsp; the Penal Code.<br><br>On account of deficient instruction and lack of education on the defendant's part, the special circumstance established by article 11 of the Code, as amended by&nbsp; Act&nbsp; No. 2142, must be applied in his favor; but&nbsp; even holding the&nbsp; concurrence of this special circumstance to offset one&nbsp; or several of the&nbsp; aggravating circumstances&nbsp; mentioned,&nbsp; from&nbsp; the nature of the penalty fixed in said article 503, No. 1, of the Penal Code, the final and extreme penalty fixed by the law must&nbsp; still be imposed upon the offender in view of the large&nbsp; number&nbsp; of aggravating circumstances, the&nbsp; greater portion of which are interrelated and lack other mitigating circumstances to offset them.&nbsp; (Penal Code, art. 80, Rule 4.)<br><br>For the foregoing reasons the judgment&nbsp; under review must be affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the defendant&nbsp; Lamberto&nbsp; Antonio, the&nbsp; penalty imposed to&nbsp; be executed at the date&nbsp; and hour the&nbsp; trial court fixes and in accordance&nbsp; with the&nbsp; provisions&nbsp; of&nbsp; Act&nbsp; No. 1577.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Johnson,&nbsp; Carson, Trent,</i> and <i>Araullo,&nbsp; JJ., </i>concur.<br></div>
