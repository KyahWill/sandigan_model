				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C.  J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>"One Sunday afternoon," as found by the court below, " about the middle of May of last year (1904) the defendant, Marciano Oruga, delivered to Simeon Manaig a letter in which the brigand, Carlos Oruga, asked the said Simeon Manaig to lend him the of 50 pesos.&nbsp; Simeon Manaig, upon receiving the letter, inquired of the defendant the contents of the same latter told him that it was request from Carlos Oruga for the sum of 50 pesos" (p. 36).<br></p><p>This finding of the court  below is supported by the evidence.  Marciano Oruga  knew the contents of the letter, according  to  the third finding  of fact  contained in the judgment of the court below, and  was accordingly sentenced to ten years' imprisonment and to pay the costs.</p>
<p>The Attorney-General  in  his brief in this court recommends that the  judgment be  affirmed under section 4 of Act No. 1121, dated April 27, 1904, and says: "Section 4 of the aforesaid  act  punishes as an act of assistance to brigands the procuring of money for them."  Such is the language used in the Spanish text and such is the meaning that might be given to the verb <em>procurar</em>.   But  the word <em>procuring </em>as used in the English text,  which is the one that should prevail, means <em>to obtain, to secure,</em> and <em>to get</em>, and certainly  Marciano Oruga did not <em>secure</em> the 50 pesos fop Carlos Oruga.  He failed in his errand because he was taken with the letter to the police authorities.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed  from is accordingly reversed, and the defendant, Marciano Oruga, is hereby acquitted, with the costs of both instances <span style="font-style: italic;">de oficio</span>.   Let judgment be entered forthwith and the case be  remanded at once.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Mapa, Carson, Willard, </em>and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
