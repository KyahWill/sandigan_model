				<H3>MATEO LABIANO, IN THE DOUBLE CAPACITY OF HEIR AND ADMINISTRATOR OF THE ESTATE OF DOMINGO LAMADRID, DECEASED, PETITIONER, VS. W. E. MCMAHON, JUDGE OF FIRST INSTANCE OF THE MOUNTAIN PROVINCE, ET AL., RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>MORELAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for a writ of certiorari to review a judgment made by the 
Court of First Instance of the Mountain Province.
<p>The court, when it performed the act complained of, was engaged in the 
determination of the ownership of certain real property which had been disposed 
of under a will duly probated in that court. During the settlement of the estate 
there was presented to the court a petition alleging that one-half of the real 
estate which the testator had attempted to dispose of by the will was not his 
property but belonged to his brother; that, therefore, the testator was the 
owner of only one-half of the property thus sought to be devised; that the 
petitioner was the daughter of the brother of the testator and, the brother 
having died, she was the owner of one-half of the property disposed of by the 
will. The petitioner, after other appropriate allegations, prayed that the court 
adjudge and decree that the petitioner was the owner of one-half of the real 
estate described in the will and that that portion be excluded from its 
dispositions.</p>
<p>The court made an order denying the petition and adjudging that all the real 
estate described in the will was owned by the testator. This decree was made and 
entered through a misunderstanding resulting from a bad translation to the court 
of the statement of the parties in interest made in open court, by virtue of 
which the court was led to believe that the parties agreed that such a decree 
should be made and entered. After ascertaining its mistake, the court set aside 
the decree and made in place thereof the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When this case was called for trial on the 2d day of May, 1913, the court 
understood that the parties had come to an agreement by which all the property 
should be awarded to the legatee in the will, as was interpreted to the court. 
But the parties have now explained to the court that there was misunderstanding. 
The court therefore revokes the order dictated on May 2, 1913, adjudging all the 
property to the legatee, and will turn this case over to a commissioner to 
examine the land and witnesses and to report the matter in thirty days. The 
court names for this purpose Mr. E. de Mitkiewicz, lieutenant-governor of 
Amburayan, who shall determine what property, if any, in the inventory, belongs 
to the opponent, Antonia Lamadrid, and in case he shall find any of it to belong 
to her he shall state that fact and shall adjudge such part to her; but in case 
he shall not find any to belong to her he shall adjudge all the property to the 
legatee, Mateo Labiano.</p>
<p>"It is agreed between the parties through their attorneys in open court that 
the decision of the commissioner shall be final with respect to who is the owner 
of the land."</p></blockquote>
<p>In pursuance of this order the commissioner named therein viewed the land in 
question, took the testimony of witnesses for and against the claim of 
petitioner, and, after duly considering the case upon the merits, wrote an 
opinion setting forth the facts as found by him from the testimony of the 
witnesses, discussed them therein at some length, investigated and considered 
the questions of law applicable thereto, and arrived at a decision in the 
following words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"From the above evidence, which was all that was available, it appears that 
Antonia Lamadrid, daughter of the deceased Juan Lamadrid, is entitled to the 
share of the land which constituted part of her father's estate, but in view of 
the fact that her uncle Domingo assumed charge of the estate for her, after the 
death of his brother, the father of Antonia, I have decided as follows:</p>
<p>"For the administrator one-half (1/2) of the estate, and a further one-tenth 
(1/10) of the estate for reimbursement for taxes, improvements, etc., making 
tris share three-fifths (3/5), and to the claimant the remaining two-fifths 
(2/5)."</p></blockquote>
<p>Sometime prior to the coming in of this decision the executor of the will, 
who was also sole devisee and who was opposing the petition referred to, having 
learned, as he says, that a commissioner had been named by the court for the 
determination of the questions raised by said petition and that such 
commissioner had been appointed upon the theory that the parties in interest had 
appeared in open court and consented thereto, made an application to set aside 
that order and to declare without force or effect the naming of the commissioner 
and praying that the court refuse to accept or act upon his report in the 
matter. This motion was based upon the ground that the said executor and devisee 
had not knowingly consented in open court or elsewhere to the appointment of the 
commissioner but, on the contrary, had always insisted that the cause be tried 
before the court itself. Upon the hearing of this motion the court made the 
following order:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This case was called before the court on a motion of the attorney for the 
executor, Mateo Labiano, asking the court to set aside a former order naming E. 
de Mitkiewicz commissioner to determine who was the owner of the land in 
question in this case and how it should be divided between the parties entitled 
thereto. These parties with their attorneys came into court and made a solemn 
agreement, in fact, asked the court to name the said commissioner in order that 
he might go out on the ground in question and see and hear the witnesses and 
decide the case. The court thereupon dictated an order in Tagudin dated May 3, 
1913. Now it appears that one of the parties through his attorney comes in and 
asks the court to annul his former order because he does not wish to abide by 
his agreement mentioned in that order.</p>
<p>"The court denies the petition because that agreement was entered into by all 
parties on their own volition and they should abide by the same. The report of 
the commissioner is hereby approved and the administrator will divide the 
property between the interested parties according to said report of the 
commissioner."</p></blockquote>
<p>The proceeding in this court for the writ of certiorari is brought upon the 
theory that the appointment of the commissioner was in violation of law, and 
therefore illegal and void, and that all that the commissioner did under such 
appointment, including the judgment which he rendered, is also unauthorized, 
illegal, and void and can have no force or effect; that a Court of First 
Instance, in a case of this character, has no authority to name a referee or 
commissioner except as provided by section 135 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 
and that the appointment in any other manner is without force or effect and 
void.</p>
<p>It is undoubted that the Organic Law relative to the Courts of First Instance 
of the Philippine Islands lays upon them the duty of hearing and deciding cases 
themselves. It is the duty, primarily, of a Court of First Instance to take the 
testimony presented in the case and to have before him the witnesses who 
declare. One of his duties is to see and hear the witnesses as they testify that 
he may form a correct conclusion as to the degree of credit which should be 
accorded them. While in certain cases and under certain conditions the parties 
may waive presentation of witnesses and present evidence in some other form, 
that does not relieve the court from the obligation, without that consent, to 
hear the case himself, to give it his personal attention, to consider it 
independently, and to form his own judgment as to the merits.</p>
<p>Except by express provision of law, courts cannot delegate their functions 
and where there is a provision permitting such delegation it must be made in the 
form and manner prescribed.; (Hards <em>vs.</em> Burton, 79 111., 504; 
Vandercook <em>vs.</em> Williams, 106 Ind., 345; Wilkins <em>vs.</em> State, 113 
Ind., 514; Chandler <em>vs.</em> Nash, 5 Mich., 410; State <em>vs.</em> 
Jefferson, 66 N. C, 309; Van Slyke <em>vs.</em> Trempealeau, 39 Wis., 390; 
Cargar <em>vs</em>. Fee, 11.9 Ind,, 536; Petty <em>vs.</em> Durall, 4 Green, 
Iowa, 120.) Section 135 provides that "by written consent of both parties, filed 
with the clerk, the court may order an action to be referred to one or more 
referees, to be agreed upon by the parties or to be appointed by the court;" and 
section 136 provides that "in such case, the clerk shall issue, under the seal 
of the court, a commission to the referees named, directing them to proceed with 
the trial of the action and to report the findings of law and fact to the court 
at or before a time named in the commission." Section 137 provides that 
"referees, before commencing the performance of their duty, shall be sworn to a 
faithful and honest performance thereof, and the fact that they have taken such 
oath shall be certified to on the commission by the authority administering the 
oath."</p>
<p>None of the conditions prescribed by those sections was complied with in this 
case. There was no agreement in writing filed with the clerk, no commission 
issued by the clerk and no oath of office taken by the referee. These being the 
only provisions of law touching the appointment of a referee, it is clear that, 
under the admitted facts, the appointment was unauthorized, the person appointed 
was without authority to act, and his proceedings were consequently without 
legal effect. As a necessary result the court, when it entered the order 
approving the report and judgment of the commissioner and dictated the judgment 
complained of, had nothing before it upon which a judgment could be legally 
entered and it was, therefore, without force or effect in law.</p>
<p>From the record it would seem that the court did not examine the evidence 
taken by the referee or form any independent judgment of its own thereon. As we 
have seen, the court simply approved the report of the referee without 
consideration of the facts upon which it was based or the conclusions of law 
which led to the judgment formed, evidently relying upon section 140 of the Code 
of Civil Procedure which provides that "upon the filing of the report or as soon 
as conveniently may be thereafter, the court shall render judgment in accordance 
with the report, as though the facts had been found by the judge himself, unless 
the court shall, for cause shown, set aside the report, or order it to be 
recommitted to the referee for further findings."</p>
<p>It results from the record in this case, therefore, that a decision has been 
rendered affecting interests in real estate by one who is not a judge of a Court 
of First Instance and to whom authority to act as such was not delegated as the 
law requires. The parties, therefore, have not had their day in court under the 
laws of the Philippine Islands and have been deprived of their property in a 
manner which the law does not sanction.</p>
<p>For these reasons we regard the proceedings relative to the appointment of 
the commissioner and all the judgments, orders, and decrees based thereon, 
either by said commissioner or the court, as null and void and of no legal value 
or effect. The same are, therefore, annulled, vacated, and set aside and the 
record of said Court of First Instance sent to this court on this proceeding is 
ordered returned for further. proceedings in pursuance of law.</p>
<p>We desire that it be clearly understood that we are not passing upon the 
merits relative to the ownership of the real estate involved in the litigation 
referred to, but simply upon the jurisdiction of the court in making the order 
complained of. It may well be that the decision of the referee was right upon 
the merits. As to that, we have nothing to say, as it does not affect the 
validity of the order before us.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres</em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em>Proceedings annulled and record remanded for further 
proceedings.</em></p></div>
