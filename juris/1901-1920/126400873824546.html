				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The present is an  appeal from an order of the Honorable George N.  Hurd, judge of the Court of First Instance of the city of  Manila, in which he had legalized the will of the said Pascual de la Cruz, deceased.</p>
<p>The contention of the opponent is that at the time  of the making of the will the said Pascual de la Cruz was blind and had been for a number of years, and was incompetent to make the will in  question.</p>
<p>Against this contention of the opponent,  all of the witnesses who signed  the will were  called as  witnesses, and each declared that the deceased was of sound mind at the time said will was made and fully understood its contents, and signed the same in their  presence and that they each signed the will in the presence of each other, as well. as in the presence of the deceased.</p>
<p>The appellant attempted to  show  that the deceased was incompetent to make his will  because he  was blind at the time the same was executed and had been  for several years theretofore.  There is absolutely no proof to show that the deceased was incapacitated at the time he executed his will. No presumption of incapacity  can arise from the mere fact that he was blind.  The only requirement of the  law as  to the capacity to make a will is that  the person shall be  of age and of sound mind and memory.   (Sec. 614, Code  of Procedure in Civil Actions.)   Section 620 of the same code prohibits  blind  persons  from  acting  as witnesses in the execution of wills, but no limitation is  placed upon testamentary capacity, except age and soundness of mind.</p>
<p>In our opinion the record contains nothing which justifies the modification of the order  made  legalizing the will  in the present case.  The order of the  lower court  admitting to  probate and legalizing the will in question is therefore hereby affirmed with costs.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Carson, Moreland,</em> and <em>Trent, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
