				<BR><STRONG>MORELAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal from a judgment of the&nbsp; Court of First Instance&nbsp; of the Province of Nueva Ecija, the Hon. Julio Llorente presiding, ordering&nbsp; the defendant to permit plaintiff to recover her land on the payment of P1,009, to deliver to the plaintiff a certain document, and dismissing: the cross complaint of the defendant.<br><br>The document which is the basis of this controversy reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"In this pueblo of Gapan, Nueva Ecija, this 2d day of June, 1896, I,&nbsp; Da. Vicenta Padilla,&nbsp; widow, native of said pueblo, with cedula of the 8th class,&nbsp; 5922 and 14, under the order issued by the administrator the 7th day of January of said year and listed here as 623, declare that the&nbsp; fifth part of my land, described in the deed hereto attached, which, according to the entry in the&nbsp; registry&nbsp; is numbered 1268, land No. 136, folio 186, vol. 7, book 1 of the registry of Gapan dated January&nbsp; 12, 1894, I have pledged to the two spouses D. Simeon Linsangan and Da. Facunda Ortiz Luis, of this pueblo, for&nbsp; the sum of two&nbsp; hundred pesos,&nbsp; which I have received in money; but we agree that I myself shall cultivate the said land and&nbsp; pay them out of each&nbsp; crop fifty cavanes of palay&nbsp; until I can&nbsp; redeem said&nbsp; land, and that I&nbsp; will deposit said palay&nbsp; in&nbsp; my camarin and&nbsp; will&nbsp; sell it whenever they require it.&nbsp; This is what we have agreed and I have signed this with witnesses.<br><br><div style="text-align: right;">(Signed)&nbsp;&nbsp; "VICENTA PADILLA.<br>(Signed)&nbsp;&nbsp; "ROSALIO YAMSUAN.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "JUAN YAMSUAN."<br></div><br>To this writing, and upon the same paper, appear these additions:<br><br>"Note. - I, the maker of the foregoing, Da. Vicenta Padilla, have received,&nbsp; in addition, fifty pesos under the same conditions&nbsp; above expressed.<br><br>"Gapan, 3d of June, 1896.<br><br><div style="text-align: right;">(Signed)&nbsp;&nbsp; "VICENTA&nbsp; PADILLA.<br>(Signed)&nbsp;&nbsp; "ROSALIO YAMSUAN.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "BENITO YAMSUAN.<br></div><br>"I, the same maker, Da. Vicenta Padilla, declare that I have received from the.said spouses, D. Simeon Linsangan and Dona&nbsp; Facunda&nbsp; Ortiz Luis, the sum of five hundred pesos; I have delivered also to them all the lands described in my deeds under the condition that I pay two hundred' cavanes; and&nbsp; I hereby sign this with&nbsp; witnesses this 5th day of June, 1896.<br><br><div style="text-align: right;">(Signed)&nbsp;&nbsp; "VICENTA&nbsp; PADILLA.<br>(Signed)&nbsp;&nbsp; "ROSALIO YAMSUAN.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "BENITO YAMSUAN.<br></div><br>"I, the one who made the first contract, Da. Vicenta&nbsp; Padilla, state that by reason of my great necessities at this moment, I have&nbsp; again&nbsp; asked&nbsp; the spouses, Don Simeon Linsangan arid Dona Facunda Ortiz Luis, to increase my debt by fifty-nine pesos,&nbsp; five reales and a half, which they have done, with which&nbsp; the total&nbsp; sum in which my lands stand pledged is eight&nbsp; hundred and nine pesos,&nbsp; five reales&nbsp; and&nbsp; a half, Under the same conditions as the&nbsp; first.&nbsp; I therefore sign this with my witnesses in the pueblo of Gapan this 29th day of September, 1897.<br><br><div style="text-align: right;">(Signed)&nbsp; "VICENTA PADILLA.<br>(Signed)&nbsp; "ROSALIO YAMSUAN.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "BENITO YAMSUAN."</div></blockquote>The question raised and argued on this appeal is whether the agreement above set out constitutes a sale with <i>pacto de retro,</i> or simply an attempt to secure a debt by a delivery of lands.<br><br>In the case of Olino vs. Medina (13 Phil. Rep., 379), the court said <pp. 382-383):=""><br><blockquote>"From the facts alleged and proven at the trial of this cause it is&nbsp; gathered&nbsp; that there was entered into between Medina and Olino either a contract of sale of said land with the right of repurchase, or one of loan of P175 secured by the land in question.<br><br>"Inasmuch as&nbsp; we are in&nbsp; doubt as to which of the two contracts it was by reason of which Medina furnished the PI75 with&nbsp; which&nbsp; Olino redeemed his land from Isidora Rendon, and Olino&nbsp; in turn consented to the transfer of the land to Medina,&nbsp; the&nbsp; party&nbsp; who furnished&nbsp; the money, we elect to consider that said contract was that of loan, because such a&nbsp; contract involves a smaller transmission of&nbsp; rights, and&nbsp; interests, and the debtor does not surrender all&nbsp; rights to his property but simply confers upon the creditor the right to collect what is owing from the value of the&nbsp; thing given as security,&nbsp; there existing between the parties&nbsp; a greater reciprocity&nbsp; of&nbsp; rights&nbsp; and obligations.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Art.&nbsp; 1289,&nbsp; Civil Code.)"</blockquote>Following this case,&nbsp; we will not&nbsp; construe these instruments to be sales with the right to repurchase, with the stringent and&nbsp; onerous effects which&nbsp; follow,&nbsp; unless the terms of the document and the surrounding circumstances require&nbsp; it.&nbsp; Whenever, under the terms&nbsp; of the writing, any other construction can fairly and reasonably be made, such construction will be adopted.&nbsp; Sales with right to repurchase are not favored and the contract will be construed as a mere loan unless the court can see that the contract, if enforced&nbsp; according to its terms,&nbsp; is not an unconscionable&nbsp; one.<br><br>We are of the&nbsp; opinion that the instrument presented in the case at&nbsp; bar is not a sale with the right to repurchase but was simply an attempt to pledge real estate as security for the payment of a loan.<br><br><i>Arellano, C.J., Mapa, Carson,</i> and <i>Trent, JJ.,</i> concur.<br></pp.></div>
