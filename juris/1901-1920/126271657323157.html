				<H3>THE UNITED STATER, COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE, VS. LAUREANO FLORES, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.

				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Gaudencio de Omaña, standing behind Mariano Ponce, killed the latter with a bolo, cutting him on the head.  The six defendants were all in front of Gaudencio when  the blow was struck and there is no evidence in the case that they knew that any such attack was contemplated.  When Ponce was thus struck down his companion, Juan Pacle, fled; he was pursued by Gaudencio, was overtaken within 20 feet, and killed by the latter.  There is some evidence in the case that one  or two of the defendants followed Gaudencio in his pursuit of Pacle, but it is not of sufficient strength to justify a finding that they participated in any way in the unlawful killing of the latter.</p>
<p>The cause for this double murder does not appear from the evidence,  but from some of the testimony it seems probable that Ponce and Pacle, two secret-service men in the employ of the Government, had arrested Gaudencio de Omafia and that Ponce had directed the policemen to take him to the station house, or that tl!fe policemen had voluntarily agreed to do this and that at this time the first murder was committed.</p>
<p>The attack upon Ponce was sudden and 'there is nothing in the evidence to show that it was not entirely unexpected by all of the defendants.  The fact  that  the  appellant, Flores, the only one of these defendants who was convicted by the court below, knew Gaudencio and had been seen in his house during the afternoon of the day  in question, is not sufficient to warrant the conclusion that he was cognizant of the intentions of Gaudencio.  Immediately after the event the appellant, Flores, ordered one of the policemen, Sotero Jose to  report the affair to the authorities in the pueblo.  They did not arrive at the place  where the offense was committed for several  hours.  During this time the appellant, Flores, and his policemen watched the bodies of  the  two men, and the evidence  indicates that Gaudencio de Omaña was, during this time, in the house of one of the officials of  the pueblo.  A company of Scouts having arrived casually at this time, he was taken into custody by the sergeant of that body.</p>
<p>The  finding  of the bolo of Gaudencio and the badge of the deceased Pacle concealed near the house of Gaudencio is not easily explained, but in the absence of any positive evidence connecting the appellant, Flores,  with the concealment,  we do  not think  these facts are sufficient  to impose upon him any responsibility.</p>
<p>What was said by this court in the case of the United States <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.  Manayao<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  (3 Off. Gaz., 232)  is applicable  to the case at bar.   It was there said:</p>
<p>"Upon this statement of facts we are of opinion that the said Simeon Manayao was guilty of the crime of <em>homicidio</em> with  which he was charged, but we think that there is not sufficient evidence in the record to  support a finding of guilty as to Angel Manayao.   The proof shows that the deceased received but one wound, and, while it is true that Angel  Manayao took sides with  said  Simeon Manayao  in the quarrel, there is nothing in the evidence to show that he joined in the commission of the <span style="font-style: italic;">homtcidio</span>, either  as principal or accomplice.   There is nothing to show  concerted  action between the said Angel Manayao and Simeon Manayao in the use of the knife and in the stabbing which resulted in the death of said Margarejo,  nor that the said Angel  Manayao had any reason to believe that his companion intended to make a deadly attack  on the deceased."</p>
<p>The  judgment  of  the court below is reversed so far  as it relates to the appellant, Flores, and  he  is acquitted, with the costs of both  instances <em>de oficio</em>.  After the expiration of ten  days from the date of final judgment, the case will be remanded to  the court below for proper action.  So ordered.</p>
