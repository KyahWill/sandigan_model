				<H3>LA COMPAÑIA MARITIMA, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. FRANCISCO MUÑOZ ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>WlLLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The plaintiff brought  this action in the Court of First Instance  of Manila against the partnership of Francisco Muiioz &amp; Sons, and against Francisco Muñoz de  Bustillo, Emilio Muñoz de Bustillo, and Rafael  Naval to recover the sum of P28,828.30, with interest and costs.  Judgment was rendered in the court below acquitting Entilio Muñoz de Bustillo and  Rafael  Naval of the complaint, and in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant partnership, Francisco Muñoz &amp; Sons, and Francisco Muñoz de Bustillo for the sum of P26,828.30 with interest at the rate of 8 per cent per  annum from the 31st day of March, 1905, and costs.  From this judgment the plaintiff appealed.</p>
<p>On the 31st  day of March,  1905, the defendants Francisco Muñoz, Emilio Muñoz, and Rafael  Naval formed an ordinary  general mercantile partnership under the  name of Francisco Muñoz &amp; Sons for the purpose of  carrying on the mercantile business in the Province of Albay which had formerly been carried on by Francisco  Muñoz.  Francisco Muñoz was a capitalist  partner and Emilio Muñoz and Rafael  Naval were industrial partners.</p>
<p>It is said  in the decision of the court below that in the articles of partnership it was called an ordinary, general mercantile partnership, but that from the articles it does not appear to be such a partnership.  In the brief of the appellees  it is  also claimed that  it is not an ordinary, general commercial partnership.   We see nothing in the case to support either the statement of the court below in its decision or the claim of the appellees in their brief. In the articles of partnership signed by the partners it is expressly  stated that they have agreed to form, and do form, an  ordinary, general  mercantile partnership.   The object of the partnership, as stated in the fourth paragraph of  the articles, is a purely mercantile one and all the requirements  of the Code  of  Commerce in  reference to such a partnership  were complied with.   The articles of partnership were recorded in  the mercantile registry of the Province  of Albay.  If it should be  held  that the contract made  in this case did not create an ordinary, general mercantile  partnership we do not see  how one could be created.</p>
<p>The  claim  of the appellees that Emilio  Muñoz contributed nothing  to the partnership, .either  in property, money, or industry, can not be  sustained.   He contributed as much as did the other industrial partner, Rafael Naval, the  difference between the two being that Rafael Naval was entitled by  the articles of agreement to a fixed salary of P2,500 as long as he was in charge of the branch office established  at  Ligao.  If he had left that  branch office soon after the partnership was organized, he would have been in the same  condition then that Emilio Muñoz was from the beginning.   Such a change would have deprived him of the salary of P2,500, but would not  have affected in any way the partnership nor have produced the effect of  relieving him  from liability as a partner.  The argument of  the  appellees seems to be that, because no yearly or  monthly salary was assigned to Emilio Muñoz, he  contributed  nothing  to  the  partnership  and received nothing from  it.  By  the articles  themselves he was  to receive at the end of five years one-eighth of the profits. It can  not  be  said, therefore,  that he received nothing from the partnership.   The fact that the receipt of this money was postponed for five years is not important.  If the contention of the appellees were sound, it would result that, Avhere the articles of partnership  provided for a distribution of profits at the end of each year, but did not assign any specific salary to an industrial partner during that time, he would not  be a member of the partnership. Industrial partners, by signing the articles, agree to contribute their work to the partnership and article 138 of the Code of Commerce prohibits them from engaging in other work except by the express consent of the partnership.   With  reference to civil partnerships, section  1683 of the Civil Code relates to the same matter.</p>
<p>It is also said in the brief of the appellees that Emilio Muñoz was entirely excluded from the management of the business.   It rather should be said that he excluded himself from such management, for he signed the articles of partnership by  the terms  of which the management was expressly conferred by him and the others upon  the persons therein  named.   That partners in  their articles can do this, admits  of no  doubt.  Article 125 of the  Code of Commerce requires them to state the  partners to whom the management is  intrusted.  This right is recognized also in article 132.  In the case  of Reyes <em>vs</em>. The Compañia Maritima (3 Phil. Rep.,  519) the articles  of association provided that the directors for the first eight years should  be certain  persons  named therein.  This court not only held that such provision  was valid but also held that  those directors  could  not be removed from office during  the eight years, even by  a majority vote of all the stockholders of the company.</p>
<p>Emilio Muñoz was, therefore,  a general partner, and the important question  in the  case is  whether,  as  such general  partner, he  is  liable to  third persons  for  the obligations contracted by  the partnership, or whether  he is relieved from such liability, either because he is an industrial  partner or  because he  was so  relieved by the express terms of the  articles of  partnership.</p>
<p>Paragraph 12 of the  articles of partnership is as  follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Twelfth. All profits arising from mercantile  transactions  carried on, as well as such as may be obtained from the sale of property and other assets which constitute the corporate capital, shall  be distributed,  on completion  of the term of five years agreed  to  for the continuation  of the partnership, in the  following  manner: Three-fourths thereof for the capitalist  partner Francisco Muiioz  de Bustillo, and one-eighth thereof for the industrial partner Emilio Muiioz de Bustillo y Carpiso, and the remaining one-eighth  thereof for  the partner Rafael Naval y Garcia. If, in lieu  of profits, losses should result in the  winding up  of the partnership,  the same shall  be for  the sole and exclusive account of the capitalist partner Francisco Muiioz de Bustillo, without  either of the  two industrial partners participating in such losses."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Articles 140 and 141  of  the Code of  Commerce are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"ART. 140. Should there not  have been stated in the articles  of copartnership the portion of the  profits to be received by  each partner,  said  profits shall be divided pro rata, in  accordance  with the interest each one has in the copartnership, partners who  have not contributed any capital,  but  giving their services,  receiving in the distribution the same amount as the  partner who contributed the smallest  capital.</p>
  <p>"ART. 141. Losses shall be charged in the same proportion among  the  partners who have contributed capital, without  including  those who have not,  unless by special agreement the latter have been constituted as participants therein."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A comparison of these articles  with the  twelfth paragraph above quoted will show  that the latter is simply a statement  of  the rule laid down  in the former.  The articles  do not,  therefore,  clwinge the rights of the industrial  partners as they are declared by  the code, and the question  may  be reduced to  the very  simple  one, namely,  Is an industrial partner in an ordinary, general mercantile partnership  liable to  third persons for  the debts and  obligations contracted by the partnership?</p>
<p>In limited partnerships the Code of Commerce recognizes a difference between  general and  special partners, but in a general partnership there is no such distinction— all the members are general partners.  The fact that some may be industrial and some capitalist partners  does not make the members of either  of  these classes alone such general partners.  There is nothing  in the  code  which says that the industrial partners  shall be the only general partners, nor is there anything which says that the capitalist partners shall be the  only general partners.</p>
<p>Article 127 of the Code of Commerce is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"All the members of the general  copartnership, be they or be they  not managing partners of the same, are liable personally and <em>in solidum</em> with all  their property for the results of the transactions made in the name and for the account  of the partnership, under the signature of the latter, and by a person authorized to make use thereof."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do  the words "all the partners" found  in this article include  industrial partners?   The  same  expression  is found in other articles of the code.  In article 129 it  is said that, if the management of the partnership has not been limited by special act to one of the partners, all shall have  the right to participate in the management.   Does this mean  that  the capitalist partners  are the only ones who have  that  right, or does it include also  industrial partners?  Article 132 provides that, when in the articles of partnership the management has been intrusted to  a particular  person, he can not be deprived of such  management, but that in  certain cases the remaining partners may appoint a comanager.  Does the  phrase "remaining partners" include industrial partners,  or is it  limited to capitalist partners, and do industrial  partners  have no right to  participate  in the selection  of the comanager? Article 133 provides  that all the partners shall have the right to  examine the books of  the partnership.  Under this article are the capitalist partners  the only ones who have such right?  Article 135  provides that the partners can not use the firm name in their private business.   Does this limitation apply only to capitalist partners or does it extend also to industrial partners?  Article 222 provides that a general partnership shall be dissolved by the death of  one of the general partners unless it is otherwise provided in the articles.   Would such  a partnership continue if  all the industrial partners should  die?  Article 229 provides that upon  a dissolution  of a general partnership it shall be liquidated by the former managers, but, if all the partners do not agree to this, a general meeting shall   be called, which  shall   determine to whom  the settlement  of the affairs shall be  intrusted.   Does this phrase "all the  partners" include industrial partners, or are the capitalist partners the only ones who have a voice in the selection of a  manager during the period of liquidation?  Article 237  provides  that the private property of the general partners shall not be taken in payment of the obligations of the  partnership until its property has been  exhausted.   Does the phrase "the general partners" include industrial partners?</p>
<p>In  all of these  articles the industrial partners must  be included.  It can not have been intended that, in such a partnership as the one in question, where there were two industrial and only one capitalist partner, the industrial partners should have no voice in the management of the business when the articles of partnership were silent on that  subject; that when  the manager appointed  mismanages  the business the industrial partners  should have no right to appoint a  comanager; that they should have no right to examine the books; that they  might use the firm  name in their private business; or that they should have  no voice in the liquidation of the business after dissolution.  To give a person who contributed no more than, say,  P500, these  rights and  to  take  them  away from a person who contributed his services,  worth, perhaps,  infinitely more than P500, would be to discriminate unfairly against industrial partners.</p>
<p>If the phrase "all the partners" as found in the articles other than article 127  includes  industrial partners, then article 127 must include  them and they are liable by the terms thereof for the debts of the firm.</p>
<p>But it is said that article 141 expressly declares  to the contrary.   It is to be noticed in the first place that this article does not say that they shall not be <em>liable</em> for losses. Article 140 declares how the profits shall be divided among the partners.  This article simply declares how the losses shall  be divided  <em>among  the  partners</em>.   The use of  the words se imputaran is  significant.  The verb means <em>abonar una partida a alguno en su  cuenta o deducirla de su debito</em>.  Article 141 says nothing about third persons and nothing about the obligations of the partnership.</p>
<p>While  in this section the word "losses"  stand's  alone, yet in other articles of the code, where it is clearly intended to  impose the liability to third persons, it is not considered sufficient,  but  the  word "obligations"  is added. Thus  article  148,  in  speaking of the liability of limited partners,  uses  the phrase  <em>las  obligaciones  y perdidas</em>. There is the same use of the two words in article 153, relating to anonymous partnerships.  In article 237 the Avord "obligations" is used and not the word "losses."</p>
<p>The claim of the appellees is that this  article 141 fixes the liability of the industrial partners to third persons for the obligations  of the  company.  If it does, then it also fixes  the liability of the  capitalist partners to the same persons for the  same obligations.  If this  article says that industrial partners are not liable for the  debts of the concern, it also says that the capitalist partners shall  be only liable for such debts in proportion to the amount of the money which they have contributed to the partnership; that is to say, that if there are only two capitalist partners, one  of  whom has contributed two-thirds of the capital and the other one-third, the latter is liable to a creditor of the company for only one-third of the debt and the former for only two-thirds.  It is apparent that,  Avhen given this construction, article 141 is directly  in conflict with article 127.  It is not disputed by the appellees that by the terms of article 127 each one of the capitalist partners is liable for all of  the  debts,  regardless of  the  amount of his contribution,  but  the  construction  which they put  upon article 141 makes such capitalist partners liable for only a proportionate part of the debts.</p>
<p>There is no injustice in  imposing  this liability upon the industrial partners.  They have a  voice  in  the  management of the business,  if no  manager has been named  in the articles; they share in  the profits and as to  third persons it is no more than  right that they should share in the obligations.  It  is admitted that  if  in this  case there had been  a  capitalist  partner who had contributed only P100  he  would   be  liable  for this  entire  debt  of P26,000.</p>
<p>Our construction of the article  is  that it relates exclusively  to the  settlement  of  the  partnership  affairs among the partners themselves and has nothing  to do with the liability of the partners to  third persons;  that each one of the industrial partners  is liable to third persons for the debts of the  firm; that if he has paid such debts out of his  private property during the life of the partnership, when its affairs are  settled he is entitled to credit for the amount so paid, and if it results that there is not  enough property in the partnership to pay  him, then the capitalist partners must pay him.  In this particular case that view is strengthened by the provisions of article 12, above quoted.  There it is stated that if, when the affairs of the partnership are liquidated—that is, at the  end of five years—it turns out that there had  been losses instead of gains,  then the capitalist partner, Francisco Muñoz, shall pay  such losses—that is, pay them to the  industrial partners if they have been compelled to disburse their own money in payment of the debts of the partnership.</p>
<p>While  this is  a commercial partnership and must  be governed therefore by the rules of the Code of  Commerce, yet an examination of the provisions of the Civil Code in reference to partnerships may throw some light upon the question here to be resolved.  Articles 1689 and 1691 contain,  in substance, the provisions  of articles 140 and 141 of the Code of Commerce.  It is to be noticed that these articles are found in  section 1  of Chapter II [Title VIII] of Book IV.  That section treats of the obligations of the partners  between themselves.   The liability of the partners as to third  persons is treated in a distinct section, namely, section 2, comprising articles  from 1697 to 1699.</p>
<p>If industrial partners in commercial partnerships  are not responsible to third  persons for the debts of the firm, then  industrial partners  in civil partnerships  are  not. Waiving  the question as to whether there can be a commercial partnership composed  entirely of industrial partners,  it seems clear that there can  be such a civil partnership, for article 1678 of the Civil Code provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"A particular  partnership has  for its  object specified things only, their use or  profits, or a specified undertaking, or the exercise of a profession or art."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It might very easily happen,  therefore, that a civil partnership could be composed entirely of industrial partners. If it were, according to the claim of  the  appellees, there would be no personal  responsibility whatever for the debts of the partnership.  Creditors could rely  only upon the property which the partnership had, which  in the case of a partnership organized  for the practice of any art or profession  would  be practically  nothing.  In  the case  of Agustin <em>vs</em>.  Inocencio,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> just decided by this court,  it was alleged in the complaint, and admitted by the answer—</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"That this partnership has been formed without articles of association or capital  other  than the personal work  of each one of the partners, whose profits are to be equally divided among themselves."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Article 1675 of the Civil Code is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"General  partnerships of profits  include  all that the partners may acquire by their industry or work during the continuation of the partnership.</p>
  <p>"Personal or real property which  each of  the partners may possess at the time of the celebration of the  agreement  shall  continue  to  be their private property, the usufruct only passing to  the partnership."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It might very well happen in partnerships of this kind that no one  of the partners would have any private property and that  if they did the usufruct thereof would be inconsiderable.</p>
<p>Having in mind these  different cases which may arise in the practice, that construction of the  law should be avoided which would enable two persons, each with a large amount of private property,  to  form and carry on a partnership and, upon  the bankruptcy of the latter, to  say to its creditors that they  contributed no capital to the company but only  their services, and that their private property is not, therefore, liable for  its debts.</p>
<p>But little light  is throAvn upon  this question by the authorities.  No judgment of the supreme court of  Spain has been called to our attention, and Ave have  been able to find  none which refers in any way to this question.   There is,. therefore, no authority from that tribunal for saying that an industrial partner is not liable to third persons for the debts of the partnership.</p>
<p>In a work  published by  Lorenzo Benito in 1889 <em>(Lectiones de derecho mercantil</em>)  it is said that industrial partners are not liable for debts.  The author, at page 127, divides general partnerships into ordinary  and irregular. The irregular partnerships are those which  include one or more industrial partners.   It may be said in passing that his views can not apply to this case because the articles of partnership directly state that it is an ordinary partnership and do not state that it is an irregular one.   But his view of the law seems to be derived from something other than the Code of  Commerce now in force.   He says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"*  *  *  but it has not been very fortunate in sketching the characters of a regular  collective partnership (since it says nothing conclusive in reference to the irregular partnership)   *   *   *.".  (p.  127.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And again:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"This article would not need to be commented upon were it not because the writer entirely overlooked the fact that there might exist industrial partners who  did not contribute with capital in money, credits,  or goods, which partners  generally participate  in  the profits  but not in the losses, and whose position must also be determined in the articles of copartnership."  (p. 128.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And  again:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The only  defect that can be pointed out in this article is the fact that it has been forgotten  that in collective partnerships there  are  industrial partners who, not being jointly  liable for  the  obligations  of  the copartnership, should not include their names in  that of the  firm." (p. 129.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a logical result of his theory he says that an industrial partner has no right to participate in the administration of the partnership and that his name  can not appear in the firm name.   In this last respect his  view is  opposed to that of Manresa, who says (Commentaries on the Spanish Civil Code, vol. 11, p. 330):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"It only remains to us to state that a partner who contributes his industry to the concern can also confer upon it the name  or  the corporate name under which  such industry should be carried on.   In this case, so  long as the copartnership lasts, it can enjoy  the credit, reputation, and name or corporate name under which such industry is carried on; but upon dissolution thereof the aforesaid name or corporate name pertains to the partner who contributed the same, and he alone is entitled to use  it, because such a name or style is an accessory to the work of the industrial partner, and upon recovering his work or his industry he also recovers  his name or the style under which he exercised his activity.  It has thus been decided by the French court of cassation in a decision dated June 6, 1859."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In  speaking of limited  partnerships  Benito says  (p. 144) that here are found two kinds of partners, one with unlimited responsibility and the  other  with limited responsibility, but adopting his view as to industrial partners, it should he said that  there are three  kinds of partners,  one  with  unlimited  responsibility,  another with limited responsibility, arid  the third, the industrial partner, with no  responsibility at all.  In  Estasen's  recent publication  on mercantile  partnerships  (<em>Tratado  de  las Bociedades Mercantiles</em>) he  quotes from the work  of  Benito, but we  do  not understand  that he commits himself to the doctrines therein laid  down.  In  fact,  in  his former treatise, <em>Instituciones  de Derecho Mercantil</em> (vol. 3, pp. 1-99), we find nothing which recognizes the existence of these irregular general partnerships, or the exemption from liability to third persons of the industrial partners.  He says in his latter  work (p. 186) that according to Dr. Benito the irregular general partner originated from the desire of the partnership to associate with itself some old clerk or employee as a reward for his services and the interest which he had shown in the affairs of the partnership, giving him in place of a fixed  salary a proportionate part of the profits of the business:  Article  2C9 of the Code of Commerce of 1829 relates to this subject and apparently provides that such partners  shall not be liable for debts. If this article was the basis for Dr.  Benito's view, it can be so no longer, for it does not appear in the present code. We held in the case of Fortis <em>vs</em>. Gutierrez Herinanos  (6 Phil, Eep., 100) that a mere agreement of that kind does not make the employee a partner.</p>
<p>An examination of the works of Manresa and Sanchez Roman on the Civil Code, and of Blanco's Mercantile Law, will show that  no one of these mentions in any way the irregular general partnership spoken of by Dr. Benito, nor is there anything  found in any one of these commentaries which in any way indicates that an industrial partner is not liable to third persons for the debts of the partnership. An examination of the French law will also show that no distinction of that kind is therein anywhere  made and nothing can  be found therein  which indicates that  the industrial partners are not liable for  the  debts of  the partnership.  (Fuzier-Herman, <em>Repertoire de Droit Frangcais</em>, vol. 34, pp. 256, 361, 510, and 512.)</p>
<p>Our conclusion is upon this branch of the case that neither on principle nor on authority can the industrial partner be relieved from liability to third persons for the debts of the partnership.</p>
<p>It is apparently claimed by the appellee in his brief that one action can not be maintained against the partnership and the individual partners, this claim being based upon the provisions of article 237 of the Code of Commerce which provides that the  private property of the partners shall not  be taken until  the partnership  property has been exhausted.  But this article furnishes no argument in support of the appellees' claim.  An action can be  maintained against the  partnership and the partners, but  the judgment should, recognize the rights of the individual partners which  are secured by said article 237.</p>
<p>The judgment of the court below is  reversed and judgment, is ordered  against all of the defendants for the sum of P26,828.30, with interest thereon at the rate of 8 per cent per annum  since the 31st day of March, 1905, and  for the costs of this  action.  Execution  on such  judgment shall not issue against the private property of the defendants Francisco  Muñoz, Emilio Muñoz, or Rafael Naval until the property  of the defendant Francisco MuQoz &amp; Sons is exhausted.  No costs will be  allowed to either party in this court.  So ordered.</p>

<em>DISSENTING</em></div>
<p><strong>ARELLANO, C.J.:</strong></p>
<p>I consider  that the judgment appealed from is entirely in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>The question set up in the majority decision, "In a regular collective commercial company, is an industrial partner liable as  to third persons by reason of the debts and obligations contracted by  the copartnership?" I  decide in a negative sense; he is not; by express provision of the law he can not  be held  to  be liable, save, of  course, an agreement to the contrary,  which in such  case would be a special law, and would  set aside the general law.</p>
<p>The basis for the contrary opinion and decision is article 127 of the Code of Commerce:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"All the members of the general copartnership, be they or be they not managing partners of the same, are personally and <em>in solidum </em>liable with all their property for the results of the transactions made in the  name and for the account  of the partnership,  under the signature of the latter, and by a person authorized to make use thereof."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, do the words  "all  the members" found in this article include the industrial  partners?</p>
<p>At first sight it would appear that they do.   In  order to complete such reasoning the  following premise will be sufficient : That  the  industrial  partners form the collective partnership; therefore the industrial partners are personally and  jointly  liable with all  their  property  for  the results of the transactions made in the  name and for account of the partnership.</p>
<p>But they form the collective partnership in the  manner in which  our  law allows  the  same to be formed—that is, by contributing with their industry, not with property.</p>
<p>And the word <em>all</em>, in reference to <em>'property</em>, which is common with the three classes of partnership defined by the code, to wit, collective, limited copartnership  (<em>comanditaria</em>), and corporation (<em>anonima</em>), gives  the rule for such personal and  joint liability,  which is the purpose of the provision  in the above-quoted article.</p>
<p>The  above three classes of partnerships  agree  in that property must in each of them be contributed.   "The articles of  general copartnership must state  * * *  the capital which each partner contributes in cash, credits, or property, stating the value given the latter or the basis on which their appraisal  is to be made."   (Art. 125.)  "The same statements shall be  included in  articles of limited copartnerships  (<em>compañias em comandita</em>) which are required for those of general copartnerships"—that is, among other things, the capital which each partner contributes. (Art. 145.)  "The articles of  incorporation (of  corporations) must include  *  *  *  the corporate capital, stating the value at which property, not cash, contributed has been appraised, or the basis on which the appraisal is to be made; and the number of shares into which  the corporate capital is divided and represented."   (Art. 151.)</p>
<p>Now, then, "The liability of the members of a corporation for the obligations  and losses of the same shall be limited to the  funds they  contributed  or bound  themselves to contribute to  the  corporate capital,"   (Art. 153.)  "The liability of special  partners for the obligations and losses of the copartnership shall be limited to the funds which they contributed or bound themselves to contribute to the limited copartnership,  with the exception of the case mentioned in article 147"—that is, if any of them  include his name or permit its  inclusion in the firm name.   (Art. 148, par. 3.)   However, in a collective partnership the liability is not limited  to the funds or property contributed,  but extends to <em>all</em> the property which partners may  own within or without the copartnership.</p>
<p>In  every  mercantile copartnership it is the corporate capital  that responds for the obligations of the same; this is elemental.  The  members of a joint stock, a limited, or a collective company respond with <em>their</em> capital for  the obligations of the association; in the joint stock concerns, with their shares;  in the limited class, with the amount contributed; in the collective, with their constituted capital.   An industrial partner, with  <em>what</em> principal sum, share, or quota in the corporate capital does he or can he respond  for the obligations of the collective partnership? Evidently with none whatever.</p>
<p>If the capital of the association is exhausted, the extreme case of <em>losses</em> incurred by the company arises, and third persons can not recover the amount of the obligations of the company from the  corporate capital, because the latter is insufficient to cover them.  Shareholders in the case of a joint stock company,  beyond the value of their  stock, have no longer to think of any ulterior subsidiary responsibility.  Neither  do the partners of a limited company. In either case the partners  are only liable to the extent of <em>their</em> corporate capital.  Collective partners  have to respond not only with  <em>their</em> corporate capital but also with <em>the whole</em> of their property outside of the association. And it is desired that the industrial partner  who, in  a collective copartnership,  did not  primarily respond with <em>his</em> corporate capital,  because he had none, shall subsidiarily respond with such property as he may have outside of the company, and with which nobody,  either within or without the copartnership, had counted upon, since both inside and outside of  the company  his industry or work only had been reckoned  with.  Therefore, the word all, of article 127 cited above, simply denoted the extent of the ulterior or subsidiary  responsibility, and that which does not appear, which does  not materially exist, can hardly be made to apply.</p>
<p>An industrial partner can  not engage in transactions of any  class  whatever,  otherwise he  would be  subject  to serious consequences (art. 138), while a capitalist partner, as a rule, may so engage  without extending profits or liabilities to the company (arts. 134 and 136); an  industrial partner, as regards profits, can only receive in the distribution the same amount  as  the partner who contributed the smallest amount of capital (art. 140); in the case &amp;t bar,  one-eighth goes to  each of the two industrial partners, three-fourths being for the capitalist, and  even  at the expiration of the copartnership they run the. risk  of having the one-eighth of  the profits earned in former years absorbed by a total loss incurred during the last year of the contract of copartnership; and it is  claimed that such industrial partner,  so much delayed with regard to profits, who  has not  the  <em>same</em> rights, shall be under  the  <em>same</em> obligations as the capitalist partners and be equally responsible as regards obligations because he is a collective partner?  This seems neither just nor logical.</p>
<p>And it is not so.  Article 141 reads: "Losses shall be charged in the <em>same</em> proportion among the partners who have contributed capital, without including" the industrial partners (since they have not the <em>same</em> rights), and they should not be included therein nor in the proportion of the partner  who contributed the smallest capital, simply for the reason that the industrial partner has nothing to lose, he not having contributed anything  which the company may lose when the losses of the copartnership are considered, either among the partners thereof  or with regard to third persons.</p>
<p>There need be no distinction made between obligations and losses.   During the existence of a company the gains or the losses are set off the one against the other, and the difference is either in favor of or against the concern. As to the industrial partner, in connection with the question submitted, it is not a matter of striking  a balance  from time to time, but one of the final adjustment of assets and liabilities, because the matter under discussion refers only to his private property, which has nothing to do with the company nor with <em>losses</em> in liquidating the same.   Article 127 is affected by article  237:  "The  private property of the general partners which is not included in the assets of the copartnership when it is established can  not be seized for  the payment  of the  obligations contracted by the copartnership until after the common assets have been attached."   And such condition  is stated in the majority decision.  As «long as there is property belonging to the company, obligations in favor of third persons are covered by the primary and direct responsibility of the company; the question arises when the assets of the company are exhausted and it becomes necessary  to appeal to the  ulterior or subsidiary liability of the private property of the partners; in this case such obligations constitute the extreme losses in the liquidation of the company.</p>
<p>The case  at bar could only thus  be set  forth: Should an industrial partner be responsible for such losses, for such obligations in favor of third persons?   Article 141 expressly states that he shall  not.  In order  to state the contrary it would be necessary to appeal to discriminations in the wording of said article; and this is neither permitted where the law does not make them nor would  they lead to anything after all.  In the  aforesaid article 237 the corroboration of the word all of article 127 may be found: "The <em>private</em> property of the general partners which is <em>not included</em> in the assets of the copartnership," differing from such as <em>were  included</em>, can not be seized  for the payment of obligations contracted by the copartnership, until after the common  assets have been  attached; after such attachment all the  assets, according to article 127, such as <em>were included</em>, and those that were <em>not included</em>, in this order, shall be subject to the results of the transactions of the copartnership.   An industrial partner has  not contributed any property whatever; he therefore offers no subject for the principal and direct seizure when the assets of the copartnership are attached.   How is it possible to conceive any  ulterior,  subsidiary,  indirect responsibility over the property which it was not even thought to be included, since he only contributed to the company his industry and work, not property of any class whatever?  It seems very anomalous that one who has not obligated himself in the least  should  be responsible for the greater part, that he who is not comprehended  Avithin the explicit terms should be included  by implication, and  that he  who  pledged nothing should be held to respond with his property.</p>
<p>As to the nature of the defendant company in this action,  I take it to be:</p>
<ol>
  <li> That  the  defendant  company is really a collective one such as  is described  in the Code of Commerce; the firm of "F. Muñoz  &amp; Sons" and the terms of  the articles of association prove it so beyond all doubt.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> That  it  is a regular collective  company; the word <em>regular</em> means, as employed in the Code of Commerce, that the collective company is the <em>rule</em>,  the standard in all commercial associations, the one combining all the effects. which are consequent upon this form of convention; and the limited and the joint-stock companies  are the <em>exception</em>.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> That it is not irrelevant in view of the manner in which the present Code of Commerce, like the former one of  1829, has denned the  collective company, that such a distinguished professor of law as Doctor Lorenzo de Benito should have established in his "Lessons on Mercantile Law"  a difference  between  the regular collective associations and the irregular collective companies; "<em>regular</em> are those wherein, as article 122 reads,  all the members in  a collective name and under a firm name  bind themselves  to participate in the proportion which they may establish with the same  rights  and obligations."  "And irregular, those wherein one or more members <em>who, though not contributing toward the company with anything but</em> their industryt participate in the  profits in  the manner agreed to in the articles  of association  or as  determined by  law, and <em>ordinarily do not share in the losses which the copartnership  may  sustain.</em> Such  members  are  called industrial partners, and the collective copartnership having a member  of said  class is  also  sometimes called an association  of capital and industry.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p>"This is what the law says (he continues), but it has not been very fortunate in  sketching  the characters of a regular collective partnership (since  in conclusion it says nothing in reference to the irregular partnership), because precisely the collective  name and the corporate name are applicable  to both the collective and the limited companies; and as to the covenant entered into by the partners to  participate in the proportion which they may establish with  the same  rights  and obligations, this is inherent to all  partnerships without  distinction  as to class.  What characterizes  this  partnership  is  <em>that all the members, 'with the exception of the industrial partners' are jointly responsible and with  all their  property for the corporate obligations."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
  <li> That the code in force, by  means of three articles, 138, 140, and 141, among those which regulate collective partnerships, has involved this association of capital and industry;  whence irregularity  necessarily  arises;  the irregularity of such  an irregular system is  that in  a collective partnership wherein,  besides the element <em>property</em>, common  or  generic  to the three  aforesaid classes, there appears this one, to wit, <em>industry</em>, a special feature only in collective partnerships, according to the system of the code.</li>
</ol>
<p>Had the system adopted by the codes of Portugal, Brazil, and the Argentine Republic been followed, a different classification would have been  made of the  association of capital and industry which, according to the last of the codes cited, is properly characterized  by  means  of the following articles:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"435. <em>Habilitacion</em> or association of capital and industry is the name given to  the partnership formed  on the one part  by one or more persons who furnish funds  for  a general business, or for some particular commercial transaction, and on the other part by one or more  individuals who join the copartnership with their industry alone.</p>
  <p>"438. The obligation  of the  partners  who furnished capital is <em>in solidum</em>, and extends beyond the capital contributed by them to the concern.</p>
  <p>"439. The articles  of association,  besides the requirements contained in article 395, must specify the obligations of the industrial partner or partners and the share in the profits to which they are entitled in the apportionment.</p>
  <p>"In the absence  of such declaration, the industrial partner shall draw from the profits a. share equal  to those of the partner who furnished the smallest capital.</p>
  <p>"440.  An industrial partner can not contract on behalf of the partnership nor is he obligated with his own property toward the creditors of the company.</p>
  <p>"Nevertheless, if besides his  industry he should  contribute some capital toward the company either in money or thing of value, the association shall then be considered as a collective one, and the industrial  partner, whatever might have been stipulated, shall respond <em>in solidum</em>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In  my opinion  it can not be  denied that there is no substantial  difference  between the three articles of  our code  and those transcribed from  that of the Argentine Republic as regards  the rights and  obligations of  industrial partners in conjunction with partners who furnish capital; there is no difference except in the system, the code of the Argentine Republic dealing with this class of  association  of capital and  industry  separately  from the only three  denned in our code, all of them of capital only  or  essentially of  partners who  furnish  capital. Therefore, as said  code has an article almost literally identical with  article 127 of our code, this question can not possibly arise in  that country.  That code contains article 454, which reads: "<em>All</em> those who form a collective commercial  company, whether  managing the  corporate funds  or not,  are obligated <em>in  solidum</em> (with all  their property, as  our code would state)  for the results of the transactions  made in the name and  for account  of the partnership," etc.  To the question,  Do  the words "all the partners" found in said article include the  industrial partners? undoubtedly the answer would  be no.</p>
<p>And it would not suffice to  say that the above article of the code of the Argentine Republic, namely, "on collective copartnerships" involves no section which  may refer to  industrial partners, and that, therefore, there can  be no  question  as to the words  "all  the members;"  it is because,  by reason of the nature thereof, whether under one system or another, the provisions and the  principles being identical, the conclusions can not be otherwise  than identical.  In a copartnership,  and as the result of the obligations thereunder, an industrial partner can not lose except what  he has actually contributed  thereto for a limited  or an unlimited purpose, subject ultimately  to company or personal obligations; this  is all that law and logic may demand of him; anything else  would not come under the law, but may be demanded of him by reason of his express covenant, because he has consented to something beyond the character and the effects of the contract of partnership of capital and industry entered into by  him, called collective;  nothing else  has been  the subject  of his consent and obligation.</p>
<p>Manuel Duran y Bas, a former professor of the University of Barcelona,  in his  addition to the work of Marti de Eixala, which is so generally and specially consulted in that eminently commercial and industrial city, has offered no remarks to the original  text of  said work which establish as an elemental doctrine that  "When  the  copartnership is purely a collective one, each of its members is jointly obligated for the result of the  transactions which should be charged to the copartnership   *   *  *.   From the general rule which  we have just  set  up the industrial partners  who contract  no obligation to  secure the liabilities of the company should be excepted, unless there be an express covenant to the contrary."   (Art.  319 of the code of 1829, identical  with art.  141 of the code now in force.)</p>
During almost half  a century no objection has  been raised by the professors of law, the  press, or  the  bar, to this doctrine regarding the  exemption,  not merely  with respect to losses but to  company obligations of the  industrial partner, on the supposition, which I do not admit, as already shown, that  it maybe possible to discriminate between   losses and obligations  in  connection  with  an industrial partner, for whom  there are none but the  final losses, such  as absorb  the assets of  the company, which can  not  be otherwise  than  outstanding  obligations  in favor  of  third parties inasmuch as,  so long as there are company  assets, no recourse can be had  to the private property  of any partner.<br>
