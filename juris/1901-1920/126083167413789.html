				G.R. No. 4086, December 21, 1907</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS.  MAXIMO BRELLO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The only evidence in the case against the defendant is the dying declaration of Pedro Oandelario.  The testimony shows that this declaration was  false in two particulars at least.   Candelario said, before he died,  that he  had been attacked by Maximo Krello  and Crispin Brello,  and that the former carried a bolo and the latter a dagger. The evidence in the case showed to the satisfaction  of the court below that Crispin Brello  took  no part in the act and  was  not even present, and  he was accordingly acquitted.</p>
<p>Candelario said also that the attack was made upon  him in the street in front of the house of the defendant, Maximo Brello.</p>
<p>The evidence of disinterested  witnesses, among them the authorities of the town, established the fact that blood was found in many places inside of the house and that no blood was found outside of the house.</p>
<p>The evidence of the defendant and his witnesses was to the effect that at 10 o'clock at night Candelario came to the house of the defendant, knocked at the door, and insisted upon the defendant coming out, saying that if he did not he would burn the house.  The defendant refused to go out and thereupon Candelario broke the door down,  came in and attacked the defendant with a cane, throwing him to the ground two or three times.  He defended himself as well as he could and finally  seized a  bolo  and struck Candelario in the stomach.  Immediately after the affair the defendant presented  himself to the authorities of the town stating what had happened.   It does not appear that Candelario had any other weapon  than a cane.</p>
<p>These facts to our mind constitute a complete  defense.</p>
<p>Candelario committed a crime in entering the house as he did, the defendant was justified in  protecting himself with such weapons as were at his hand,  and if from that defense the death  of the aggressor resulted, that result must be attributed to his own wrongful act and can not be charged to the defendant.</p>
<p>The judgment of the court below as to the appellant is reversed  and he  is  acquitted, with the costs of both instances <em>de oficio</em>.   Let judgment be entered at once to  that effect and an order issued for the release of the appellant, unless he is held upon some other charge.   So  ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano,  C. J., Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ., </em>concur.</p>
