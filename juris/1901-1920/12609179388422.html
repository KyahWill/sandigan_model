				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The defendant was charged with the crime of usurpation of public functions  <em>(usurpacion, de funciones)</em> in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Iloilo,  was found guilty of said crime, and sentenced by said court  to be imprisoned in the provincial jail of Jaro, or such other prison as  the law directs, for a term of two years and  to pay the costs of prosecution.</p>
<p>This action was brought under article 328 of the Penal Code, which provides thatâ€”</p>
<p>"He who,  without warrant or  legitimate cause,  shall exercise acts  pertaining to an authority or public official, attributing to himself an official character, shall be punished with the penalty of <em>prision correccional</em> in its  minimum and medium degrees."</p>
<p>The evidence shows that in the month of  September, 1903, the defendant did on several occasions represent himself to be a member  of the secret service connected with the Constabulary of the Province of Iloilo, while in truth and in fact he was not a member of  such secret  service, nor was he in fact connected in any way with the Constabulary and held no official rank whatever in said organization.   These facts were supported by several  witnesses  on behalf of the prosecution.</p>
<p>The evidence adduced during the trial in the court below shows beyond peradventure of doubt  that the defendant was guilty of the crime charged.  The decision of the inferior court is therefore affirmed and the defendant is hereby sentenced  to  be imprisoned for a period of two years of<em> prision correcional</em>, but  by virtue of article 93 of the provisional  laws for the application  of the Penal Code, the defendant  is hereby given the benefit of half the period of imprisonment which  he  suffered prior to the time of trial in the inferior court.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Mapa, Carson,</em> and <em>Willard, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
