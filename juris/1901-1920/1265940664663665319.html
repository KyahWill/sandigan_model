				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The defendant and appellant in this case was convicted in the court below of 
the crime of seduction (<em>estupro</em>) and sentenced to imprisonment for a 
period of four months, to pay the sum of P500 to the complaining witness 
Petronila Silverio by way of civil indemnification for the injury done her, to 
support the offspring of the illicit relations between the parties, if. any 
there be, and to pay the costs of the trial.
<p>The evidence of record conclusively establishes that the accused and the 
young woman whom it is alleged he seduced were both employees of the Alhambra 
tobacco factory, and that friendly if not intimate relations had been 
established between them while at work in the factory; that at an early hour on 
the morning of April 29, 1913, and long before the factory opened, they met in 
the street at a point some little distance from the factory, and almost 
immediately thereafter entered a street vehicle, which was called and hired by 
the accused; that they drove to the house of one Jacinto Rodriguez, a friend of 
the accused, who provided him with a room in which the couple stayed for about 
an hour; that during that period they had carnal relations with each other; that 
thereafter they had breakfast with the family of Rodriguez and later went to the 
factory, arriving there about 8 o'clock; that the young woman went to her home 
about 1 o'clock, and returned to the factory that afternoon, accompanied by her 
aunt and some ten or twelve other relatives and friends; that finding the 
accused the party demanded that he go at once to a minister and marry the girl; 
that despite some protests, the party compelled him to go with them; that the 
minister declined to marry the couple, it appearing from the cedula of the 
accused that he was a married man; and that thereafter these criminal 
proceedings were instituted at the instance of the young woman and her aunt.</p>
<p>The information charges that the accused induced the young woman to have 
sexual intercourse with him "by means of deceit, to wit, under promise of 
marriage." The only evidence of record in support of this allegation is the 
testimony of the young woman herself. In her first account of the incident she 
stated that the promises of marriage were made "while he was having intercourse 
with me," but later on in the course of her testimony, and in reply to a 
question as to whether the accused had made any such promises on any other 
occasion, she said that he had also promised to marry her while they were in the 
street vehicle, on the way to the house of Jacinto Rodriguez.</p>
<p>We do not think that a conviction of the crime of <em>estupro</em> 
(seduction) can be sustained on this evidence. To constitute seduction there 
must in all cases be some sufficient promise or inducement, <em>and the woman 
must yield because of the promise or other inducement.</em> If she consents 
merely from carnal lust, and the intercourse is from mutual desire, there is no 
seduction. (43 Cent. Digest, tit. Seduction, par. 56.) She must be induced to 
depart from the path of virtue by the use of some species of arts, persuasions, 
or wiles, which are calculated to have, and do have that effect, and which 
result in her ultimately submitting her person to the sexual embraces of her 
seducer. (People <em>vs.</em> Smith, 132 Mich., 58.) The penalty prescribed in 
the third paragraph of article 443 of the Penal Code, which defines and 
penalizes this offense, cannot be imposed unless it appears that the alleged 
seduction was accomplished "by means of deceit." That is to say, of course, that 
the penalty cannot be imposed unless it appears that the woman was induced to 
yield her body to the seducer by means of some deceit. Hence, where the deceit 
alleged is a promise of marriage, it must appear that the woman was induced to 
yield her body to the seducer by means of such promise, and that she surrendered 
her virtue in reliance upon its fulfillment. Manifestly a promise of marriage 
made after sexual intercourse has taken place, or after the woman has yielded 
her body to the man's illicit embraces, cannot be held to have induced the woman 
to surrender her virtue. Nor can a promise of marriage made by a married man, 
where the woman knows that he is married before she surrenders herself, be said 
to.have induced her so to do; for m such a case it is clear that there was no 
reliance on the promise. And, indeed, it has frequently been held that in any 
case wherein it appears that the surrender of the woman was not made in reliance 
upon a promise of marriage, a conviction of the crime of seduction cannot be 
sustained on the ground that such a promise had been made, though proof of a 
promise of marriage followed by carnal relations will generally be sufficient to 
sustain the inference that they were induced by such promise, in the absence of 
affirmative evidence to the contrary. See many cases cited under Note 80, 35 
Cyc., 1335.</p>
<p>In the case at bar the evidence in support of the alleged promises of 
marriage is neither satisfactory nor convincing ; and even if the testimony of 
the woman in this regard be accepted as true, it raises a grave doubt as to 
whether she was in fact induced to yield her body by means of the promises to 
which she testified. Upon her own testimony, the first promises of this nature 
were made after she had voluntarily, and of her own free will, gotten into the 
street vehicle. No satisfactory explanation of the conduct of the young woman, 
in accompanying the accused in the street vehicle, was offered at the trial, nor 
does one suggest itself at this time, other than that she had already made up 
her mind to enter into illicit relations with the accused when she entered the 
vehicle. Having in mind the friendly if not amorous relations already existing 
between the couple; the early hour at which they met, long before the opening of 
the factory in which they were employed; the short discussion, promptly followed 
by the calling of a street vehicle; the ready acquiescence of the young woman in 
getting into the vehicle and driving to the house of a friend of the accused, 
where they were evidently expected; and all that occurred thereafter; we are 
strongly inclined to believe that everything had been planned the night before, 
the early hour and the place of meeting having been selected and agreed upon so 
that the couple might consummate their amorous relations without fear of 
discovery by the young woman's family. But however this may have been, we think 
that the weight of the evidence sustains a finding that the intercourse between 
the couple was induced by niutual desire, and that she had made up her mind to 
surrender herself to her lover before she got into the vehicle, and before the 
alleged promises were made by him, if indeed it be a fact that he made any such 
promises.</p>
<p>There is evidence in the record to the effect that She knew the accused was a 
married man, long before they had their illicit relations, and this evidence, 
though hardly sufficient to sustain an affirmative finding on this point, tends" 
to confirm us in our doubt of the truth of her statement that she was induced to 
yield her virtue to the accused by the alleged promises of marriage.</p>
<p>Let judgment be entered reversing the judgment entered in the court below, 
and acquitting the defendant and appellant of the offense with which he is 
charged in the information, with the costs in both instances <em>de 
offlcio.</em></p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Moreland, Trent,</em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.,</em> 
concur.</p>
<p><em>Judgment reversed; defendant acquitted.</em><br></p></div>
