				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an action for damages for the wrongful destruction&nbsp; of a fish trap placed in the waters of&nbsp; the municipality of Talibon, Province of Bohol.<br><br>The plaintiff alleges that from the month of March, 1906, until February, 1907, and especially during the month last mentioned, the plaintiff had been soliciting&nbsp; and obtaining from the municipality of Talibon a license to place a fish trap in the locality known as Lobungan, municipality&nbsp; of Talibon,&nbsp; Province of Bohol; that in&nbsp; February, 1907, the plaintiff had located a fish trap in the waters above named, having a proper license for such privilege; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant,&nbsp; knowing that fact,&nbsp; placed&nbsp; another fish&nbsp; trap&nbsp; in the&nbsp; same locality; that&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; 14th of&nbsp; February,&nbsp; 1907, the defendant removed or caused to&nbsp; be removed from the place in&nbsp; which it&nbsp; then was the fish trap belonging to the plaintiff, and transferred or caused to be transferred the materials composing such fish trap to a building belonging to the municipality&nbsp; of&nbsp; Talibon;&nbsp; that,&nbsp; by reason of the defendant's wrongful act, the plaintiff had suffered damages in the sum of P1,500, the value of the materials removed, and&nbsp; for the loss of the profits which he would have made had&nbsp; he been permitted peacefully to&nbsp; operate&nbsp; his trap,&nbsp; in the sum of P3,000.<br><br>The defendant, answering the complaint, alleged that he had obtained&nbsp; a license to construct a&nbsp; fish trap in the locality heretofore described on the 11th day of December, 1906; that, after obtaining&nbsp; said license and&nbsp; before anyone else&nbsp; had placed a fish&nbsp; trap in the locality to which&nbsp; his license referred, he constructed and placed in&nbsp; said locality a fish trap in conformity with the terms of&nbsp; said license, and&nbsp; began to operate the same;&nbsp; that&nbsp; the fish trap&nbsp; being thus located and&nbsp; in operation, the&nbsp; plaintiff, illegally and without warrant&nbsp; of law,&nbsp; and in violation of the ordinances of the municipality, and&nbsp; for the&nbsp; purpose of injuring the defendant, on the 27th day of December,&nbsp; 1906, constructed his fish trap in&nbsp; the same&nbsp; locality,&nbsp; placing&nbsp; the&nbsp; same&nbsp; in relation to the&nbsp; location of the defendant's trap at a place prohibited by the ordinances of the municipality; that by reason of&nbsp; such&nbsp; violation of said ordinances, the defendant complained to the proper&nbsp; authorities, the plaintiff was arrested&nbsp; for said violation,&nbsp; was&nbsp; convicted&nbsp; and fined in accordance with the provisions of law.<br><br>It seems from the evidence introduced&nbsp; on the trial that the defendant, as he alleges, had, on the 11th day of December, obtained a license to place&nbsp; a&nbsp; fish trap in the locality already mentioned, and, in pursuance of&nbsp; said license, had constructed his fish trap&nbsp; to completion prior to&nbsp; the 24th day of December; that prior to the said&nbsp; 24th day of December the plaintiff in this&nbsp; case, without a license, had begun to&nbsp; construct&nbsp; a fish trap&nbsp; in the same&nbsp; locality, but within&nbsp; 150 feet of the fish trap of the defendant,&nbsp; and said fish trap&nbsp; was constructed or in&nbsp; process&nbsp; of&nbsp; construction on said 24th day of December; that on said date the plaintiff obtained&nbsp; his license to place the fish trap&nbsp; the construction of which he had&nbsp; begun some time before <span style="font-style: italic;">without a license.</span><br><br>It seems also from the proofs that there existed&nbsp; an ordinance&nbsp; in the municipality of Talibon which prohibited one from building a&nbsp; fish trap without a&nbsp; license,&nbsp; and also from building a fish trap with a license within 150 feet of a fish trap&nbsp; already constructed or in process of construction. <br></div><div align="justify"><br></div><div align="justify">It will be&nbsp; thus&nbsp; observed that, at the time&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff began&nbsp; to construct his fish trap and up&nbsp; to the 24th day of&nbsp; December aforesaid,&nbsp; he was acting in&nbsp; violation of the ordinances of the municipality, in that&nbsp; he had&nbsp; not yet obtained a license to construct or to begin the construction of&nbsp; a fish trap.&nbsp; Moreover, even though he had had a license, he&nbsp; was still violating the ordinances of the village in that he was&nbsp; constructing his trap&nbsp; within&nbsp; 150 feet of the defendant's.&nbsp; It&nbsp; appears further that&nbsp; at the time the defendant&nbsp; had completed&nbsp; his fish&nbsp; trap, the&nbsp; plaintiff had received no license to construct one.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, every act he performed in the construction of his trap was in violation of the law and he could, accordingly, acquire no rights against the municipality or against the defendant by such acts.<br><br>From the facts proved it appears that the defendant took no part directly&nbsp; or indirectly in the removing of plaintiff's fish trap.&nbsp; That was done by the&nbsp; municipal&nbsp; police under the directions of the municipality.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; was present at the time&nbsp; the&nbsp; removal was effected, but, so&nbsp; far as&nbsp; appears from the record, took no part therein and gave no directions in relation thereto.<br><br>The learned trial&nbsp; court upon&nbsp; the trial found in favor of&nbsp; the plaintiff,&nbsp; awarding&nbsp; him&nbsp; a judgment against&nbsp; the defendant&nbsp; for&nbsp; damages in the&nbsp; sum of P400,&nbsp; with interest thereon from the date of the presentation of the complaint. From the facts already presented, and the reasons above expressed,&nbsp; we are of the opinion that the judgment of&nbsp; the learned trial&nbsp; court must be reversed&nbsp; and the defendant absolved from liability in relation&nbsp; to the facts set out in plaintiff's complaint.<br><br>The judgment&nbsp; of the court below&nbsp; is accordingly reversed, without special finding as to costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Arellano, C.&nbsp; J., Torres, Johnson,&nbsp;</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Trent, JJ., </span>concur.</div>
