				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The issues raised by this appeal are criminal in nature although based on a 
civil transaction. They all relate to the alleged violation of sections 10 and 
12 of the Chattel Mortgage Law by a mortgagor of personal property.
<p>The chattel mortgage in question, to which the parties are Pedro N. Liongson, 
mortgagee and proprietor, and Brigido Razon, mortgagor and tenant, reads in 
translation as follows:</p>
<p>"I, Brigido Razon, of legal age, married, laborer, and resident of 
Concepcion, Tarlac, P. I., do hereby acknowledge being indebted to Pedro N. 
Liongson, a resident of the capital of Tarlac, Tarlac, in the sum of P1,534.50 
and for 530 cavans of palay, both the amount and the palay being payable as soon 
as the next harvest of palay takes place, which I have planted in the field of 
the said mortgage creditor, located in the barrio of Sta. Cruz, municipality of 
Concepcion, Tarlac, P. I., which harvest will take place during January and 
February, 1917. And to guarantee the payment of this amount, I, the mortgage 
debtor, do hereby transfer by way of mortgage to the said mortgage creditor, 
Pedro N. Liongson, the said harvest of palay, under the following 
conditions:</p>
<p>"(A) That I, the mortgage debtor, promise to duly guard, take care of, and 
protect the said harvest during the period of its growth and development and to 
reap the same truly and without delay, and that the mere lack of compliance with 
any of these conditions will entitle the mortgage creditor, without further 
proceedings, to enter upon the land. take the necessary steps for the protection 
of the harvest. put it under his control, and sell it, and with the proceeds of 
the sale to reimburse himself for the expenses incurred for the care, reaping, 
and sale, and the amount of the debt above stated.</p>
<p>"(B) That I, the mortgage debtor, do hereby promise not to dispose of, 
transfer, or mortgage the said harvest or any part thereof until the total 
amount of indebtedness guaranteed by this mortgage is fully satisfied.</p>
<p>"The conditions of this mortgage are such that if I, the mortgage debtor, my 
heirs, representatives, executors, or administrators should pay the total amount 
of the debt and should comply well and truly with the conditions above expressed 
in accordance with the terms of this contract, this obligation shall be null and 
void; otherwise, to be of full force and effect.</p>
<p>"In witness whereof we hereunto subscribe our names at Tarlac, Tarlac, July 
1, 1916.</p>
<p align="right">(Sgd.) "Brigido Razon.<br>(Sgd.) "Pedro N. Liongson.</p>
<p>"In the presence of:</p>
<p align="right">(Sgd.) "Policarpo Gonzaga.<br>(Sgd.) "Tiburcio Quitu.</p>
<p>"We, the mortgage creditor and debtor, individually swear that the preceding 
mortgage has been executed for the purpose of guaranteeing the payment of the 
debt and the compliance of the conditions above specified and not for any other 
purpose, and that the same is an obligation just and valid, and has not been 
executed for the purpose of fraud.</p>
<p align="right">(Sgd.) "Brigido Razon.<br>(Sgd.) "Pedro N. Liongson.</p>
<p>"(Acknowledgment and certificate of registration follow.)"</p>
<p>On July 3, 1917, or after the palay mentioned in the chattel mortgage was 
supposed to have been harvested and delivered to Liongson, an information was 
filed in the Court of First Instance of Tarlac, charging Brigido Razon and his 
wife Martina Tayag with a violation of the Chattel Mortgage Law, based on the 
terms of the chattel mortgage, and alleging that the defendants failed to comply 
with the conditions of the mortgage and with intent to defraud and prejudice the 
interests of the mortgagee, without his knowledge, had disposed of a portion of 
the mortgaged property. A demurrer to the complaint with respect to Martina 
Tayag was sustained, and the trial proceeded only against her husband Brigido 
Razon. The court found the defendant guilty as charged and sentenced him to pay 
a fine of P4,295, to pay one-half of the costs, and to suffer subsidiary 
imprisonment in case of insolvency not to exceed six months.</p>
<p>The section of the Chattel Mortgage Law, section 10, Act No. 1508, to which 
these proceedings relate, is as follows:</p>
<p>"A mortgagor of personal property shall not sell or pledge such property, or 
any part thereof, mortgaged by him without the consent of the mortgagee in 
writing on the back of the mortgage and on the margin of the record thereof in 
the office where such mortgage is recorded."</p>
<p>Section 12 of the same law provides the penalty for the mortgagor, who 
violates the provisions of section 10.</p>
<p>It will be noticed that section 10, in referring to the mortgaged personal 
property which cannot be sold or pledged, adds the phrase "or any part thereof." 
The result is, as recently held by this court, in the United States vs. Iguidez 
([1917], 36 Phil. Rep., 860), that the unauthorized removal or sale of mortgaged 
property, whether it be all or any part of such property, so long as all or any 
part of the mortgage indebtedness remains unpaid, is penalized under the 
provisions of the Chattel Mortgage Law. If, then, Brigido Razon, the mortgagor 
of this palay, did sell any part of the palay which was mortgaged by him without 
the expressed consent of the mortgagee he must be found guilty as charged.</p>
<p>Appellant makes fourteen assignments of error. The Attorney-General 
reclassifies these assignments. Being impressed by the painstaking care 
disclosed by the brief of the Attorney-General and being uncertain whether his 
analysis could be improved upon, the order and much of the argument used by the 
representative of the Government will be followed in the discussion of these 
assignments.</p>
<p>1. Sufficiency of the Evidence Regarding the Question of Whether or not the 
Mortgage Was a Liquidated Balance Due the Mortgagee, or the Gross Indebtedness 
of the Mortgagor.—The first, sixth, seventh, and eighth assignments of error 
allege in substance that the indebtedness mentioned in the mortgage was not jsl 
liquidated balance due the mortgagee but merely the gross indebtedness of the 
mortgagor, to which had been added usurious interest and from which should be 
deducted various amounts which were paid to the mortgagee prior to the execution 
of the mortgage. The evidence on this point is irreconcilable. We do not go into 
the rival contentions because unnecessary in view of the outcome as to other 
questions which more easily dispose of the case.</p>
<p>2. Admissibility of a Summary of Accounts.—The fifth assignment of error 
alleges in substance that Exhibit C, che memorandum of Liongson, should not have 
been admitted in evidence for two reasons: (1) Because if it was evidence which 
should have been admitted at all, it should have been submitted by the 
prosecution before it rested its case and not on rebuttal, and (2) because it is 
hearsay. The rules of evidence permit the use of considerable discretion by 
trial courts in the admission of rebuttal evidence. (Mueller <em>vs</em>. 
Rebhan, [1879], 94 Ill., 142.) With special reference to the instant case, it 
cannot be said that the trial court abused its discretion in this respect 
because the defendant was not taken by surprise and was not prevented from 
introducing evidence in sur-rebuttal. The question, also, of whether or not this 
memorandum, which appears to be merely a summary of accounts, should be regarded 
as hearsay, should follow much the same principle as above enunciated. In other 
words, questions of this sort must necessarily be left to the discretion of the 
trial court, but such statements usually prepared just previous to the trial 
should only be permitted to be introduced where the books and documents are 
multifarious and voluminous and of a character to render it difficult for the 
court to comprehend material facts without the aid of such statements. (Boston 
&amp; W. R. R. Co. <em>vs</em>. Dana [1854], 1 Gray [Mass.], 83.)</p>
<p>We do not think that in the admission of Exhibit C error was committed by the 
trial court or that thereby the case of the defendant was prejudiced.</p>
<p>3. Admissibility op Certain Supposed Confessions or Admission.—There is a 
plain distinction between confessions and admissions. These two terms have 
heretofore been accurately defined by this court in The United States 
<em>vs</em>. Corrales ([1914], 28 Phil., 362). Out of the difference between the 
two arises the conclusion that the statutory provision excluding evidence as to 
a confession until and unless the prescribed foundation is laid is not 
applicable to an admission. In the instant case, the so-called confession was no 
more than an admission by the defendant that he had sold 150 <em>cavanes</em> of 
palay to pay for eight carabaos. As the sale of palay to pay for carabaos is not 
a crime, necessarily this statement by the defendant amounted to no more than an 
admission.</p>
<p>This statement of the defendant, which does not amount to a confession, was 
then not improperly admitted. The ninth assignment of error is thus disposed 
of.</p>
<p>4. Sufficiency of the Evidence to Prove the "Corpus Delicti."—The second and 
tenth assignments of error allege in substance that the court erred in 
considering that the palay claimed to have been illegally disposed of was 
covered by the mortgage. It is true that the mortgage is indefinite in this 
respect for it does not state how much palay the mortgagor then had planted on 
the land mentioned. Neither is there any direct evidence proving that all or any 
of the palay alleged to have been illegally disposed of was planted or in 
existence on July 1, 1916, the date of tha mortgage. We believe, however, that a 
fair inference from all the terms of the mortgage is that the mortgagee had a 
potential interest in the crop, and that the terms of the mortgage related to a 
growing crop which was expected to be harvested in January and February of 
1917.</p>
<p>We hold against appellant as to these two assignments of error.</p>
<p>5. Sufficiency of the Evidence as to the Amount of Palay Harvested by the 
Defendant on the Land of the Mortgagee.—The third and fourth assignments of 
error concern the question as to whether the court erred in finding that there 
was a balance of 1,480 <em>cavanes</em> of mortgage palay harvested by the 
defendant on the land of the mortgagee in the first three months of 1917, after 
the costs of caring for and reaping the crop were paid. All of the witnesses 
agree that approximately 1,330 <em>cavanes</em> of palay were thrashed on the 
property under defendant's control in February, 1917. To constitute the amount 
of 1,480 <em>cavanes</em> mentioned in the decision of the court, it was 
necessary to add 150 <em>cavanes</em>, the alleged sale of which may have 
occurred six months or a year before the mortgage was prepared. Without positive 
proof such as is required in criminal cases, we should not make a guess to the 
detriment of the accused. The undisputed evidence is that approximately 1,330 
<em>cavanes</em> of palay were thrashed by defendant, and therefore constituted 
the gross amount taken from the land.</p>
<p>On the question of fact raised by these two assignments of error, appellant 
is correct.</p>
<p>6. Sufficiency of the Evidence to Prove That the Defendant Sold 859 "Cavanes" 
of Mortgaged Palay without the Consent of the Mortgagee.—The eleventh assignment 
of error alleges in substance that the court erred in convicting the accused for 
the sale supposed to have been made by the wife of appellant to certain persons 
of part of the palay mortgaged to Liongson. The twelfth assignment of error 
alleges in substance that the court erred in finding that the accused and his 
wife sold 859 <em>cavanes</em> of mortgaged palay. The evidence proving sale of 
the palay by the defendant is uncertain and inconclusive.</p>
<p>The exact situation can be more readily grasped by the following analysis. As 
previously found 1,330 <em>cavanes</em> was the gross amount of palay harvested 
on this land. It was claimed that Liongson, the owner of the land, was by 
agreement to receive five per cent of the entire crop. Ten per cent was the 
share belonging to the thrasher. Fifty per cent was the subtenants' share. Five 
per cent of 1,330 <em>cavanes</em> equals 67 <em>cavanes</em>, Liongson's share. 
Ten per cent of 1,330 <em>cavanes</em> equals 133 <em>cavanes</em>, the 
thrasher's share. Fifty per cent of 1,330 <em>cavanes</em> equals 665 
<em>cavanes</em>, the subtenant's share. Liongson's+thrasher's+defendant's=665 
<em>cavanes</em>. Or, 665 <em>cavanes</em>-67 <em>cavanes</em>-133 
<em>cavanes</em>=465 <em>cavanes</em>, defendant's share. Liongson admitted that 
he received 488 <em>cavanes</em> and the defense claims that he received 542 
<em>cavaves</em>. 465 <em>cavanes</em> was, consequently, the only amount which 
defendant could mortgage. As Liongson received at least 23 more <em>cavanes</em> 
of palay than that mortgaged, the terms of the mortgage could not have been 
violated regardless of whether the full amount mentioned in the mortgage was or 
was not paid. If defendant's claim, that P1,534.50 was the amount of the 
mortgage and that the 530 <em>cavanes</em> of palay mentioned in the mortgage 
was in the nature of interest, is true, then from the standpoint of equity, at 
the current price of rice as testified to by the provincial governor, Liongson 
received all that was coming to him. To sanction more would be to sanction 
usury.</p>
<p>While objection might be raised to the deduction derived from these figures, 
remembering that this is a criminal case, and resolving all reasonable doubt in 
favor of the defendant, we must find that because of a lack of credible evidence 
and because apparently the mortgagor had done all that he was required to do 
under the mortgage, the allegations in these two assignments of error are 
correct.</p>
<p>Conclusion.—As indicated in the beginning of this decision the appeal 
presents aspects both civil and criminal in nature. It partakes of the nature of 
a civil case in that the amount of the account between the mortgagor and the 
mortgagee must be liquidated with accuracy and definiteness. A preponderance of 
the evidence would prove the obligation of the mortgagor of the palay to the 
mortgagee. The case, however, is distinctly criminal, and being so, in 
accordance with old principles, the accused must be presumed to be innocent 
until he is proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and until the defense is 
shown to be untenable. If the defendant is under any obligation to Liongson, it 
is a civil obligation.</p>
<p>Following the recommendation of the Attorney-General, the judgment of the 
trial court is reversed and the defendant and appellant is acquitted with costs 
de officio. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Carson, Araullo, Street, Avanceña</em>, and 
<em>Fisher, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
