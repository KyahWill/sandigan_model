				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On the 23d of September, 1913, the prosecuting attorney of the&nbsp; Provinces of Cagayan&nbsp; and&nbsp; Isabela presented complaints,&nbsp; in the Courts of First&nbsp; Instance of said provinces, charging the defendants with the&nbsp; crime of larceny&nbsp; alleged to have&nbsp; been committed&nbsp; as&nbsp; follows:&nbsp; "The&nbsp; undersigned charges Atanasio Claravall, Antonio&nbsp; Raymundo,&nbsp; Manuel San Jose,&nbsp; Cosine Hermoso, and Roman Belo with the crime of theft, provided&nbsp; for and punished by&nbsp; articles 517 and 518, No. 3 in connection with&nbsp; the circumstance No. 8&nbsp; of article&nbsp; 10, of the Penal Code,&nbsp; committed&nbsp; as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"That on or about the 9th day of February, 1913, in the municipality of&nbsp; Ilagan, Province of Isabela, P.

At the beginning of the trial the attorney for the defendants&nbsp; and the prosecuting attorney entered into an agreement to the effect that the two cases&nbsp; should be tried together, and that the evidence adduced should be considered, so far as it was applicable, in both&nbsp; cases.&nbsp;&nbsp; The only difference&nbsp; in&nbsp; the two cases&nbsp; was in&nbsp; the quantity of property&nbsp; stolen, and the date on which&nbsp; it was stolen.<br><br>From an examination of the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause,&nbsp; we find that the following facts were proven, beyond a reasonable doubt:<br><br>First. That in the month of February, 1913, the municipality of Ilagan, of the Province of Isabela, was building a schoolhouse of cement and galvanized iron.<br><br>Second. That the&nbsp; defendant, Atanasio Claravall, in the month of&nbsp; February,&nbsp; 1913, was an employee in the&nbsp; office of the district engineer of that district; that the construction of said schoolhouse was under the direction of the district engineer.<br><br>Third. That the municipality had purchased for use in the construction of&nbsp; said schoolhouse, a large number&nbsp; of sheets of&nbsp; galvanized iron which were stored in the storehouse near where&nbsp; the&nbsp; schoolhouse was&nbsp; being constructed; that said&nbsp; storehouse was in&nbsp; charge of a watchman by the name of Crispulo Allayban.<br><br>Fourth. That in the&nbsp; month of February,&nbsp; 1913,&nbsp; the defendant, Antonio Raymundo,&nbsp; had been granted permission to erect a camarin&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the land belonging to the&nbsp; said Claravall, which&nbsp; camarin was to&nbsp; be&nbsp; covered&nbsp; with&nbsp; iron roofing.<br><br>Fifth. That on the 9th of February, 1913, the said ClaravaU&nbsp; went to said watchman (Allayban)&nbsp; and told him that certain cartmen would come to said storehouse to get some of the&nbsp; galvanized iron roofing stored&nbsp; therein;&nbsp; that the said watchman refused to permit the galvanized&nbsp; iron to be taken away,&nbsp; in the absence of the district engineer; that Claravall stated&nbsp; to the watchman that&nbsp; he, in&nbsp; the absence of the district engineer, would be responsible; that on the night of the 9th of February, or&nbsp; between three and four o'clock in the morning of the 10th, one Pedro Teodoro, an employee of the defendant Raymundo, together with two other of Raymundo's employees, Cosme Hermoso and Roman Belo, arrived at the storehouse&nbsp; with two&nbsp; carts and loaded on said carts,&nbsp; fifty sheets of the said galvanized iron; that the said&nbsp; Claravall and Raymundo were&nbsp; person-ally present at the time the galvanized iron&nbsp; was taken out of the storehouse and&nbsp; superintended&nbsp; the loading thereof onto the carts.<br><br>Sixth. That on the night of February 10, 1913, or very early in the morning of February 11th, the same persons, except the said Raymundo, arrived again at said storehouse and again,&nbsp; in the manner described in the preceding paragraph, took and carried away 25 more sheets of the galvanized iron from said storehouse; that during the time when the other defendants were taking and carrying away the second load&nbsp; of&nbsp; galvanized&nbsp; iron, the&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; Raymundo remained&nbsp; at his house, which is only forty or fifty yards from the storehouse.<br><br>Seventh. That the said seventy-five sheets of galvanized iron,&nbsp; which&nbsp; had&nbsp; been&nbsp; taken&nbsp; as above described,&nbsp; were hauled to the house of the defendant, Manuel San&nbsp; Jose, and there stored&nbsp; beneath his residence; that the&nbsp; residence of Manuel San Jose&nbsp; is located about 500 meters from said schoolhouse;&nbsp; that Manuel San&nbsp; Jose is&nbsp; a contractor&nbsp; and builder.<br><br>Eighth. That on or about the 29th of March,&nbsp; 1913, the said district engineer returned to the municipality of Ilagan and&nbsp; was notified by the third member of the provincial board, the municipal presidente, and Pedro Teodoro of the loss of the said 75 pieces of galvanized iron; that an investigation was immediately made and&nbsp; said sheets of iron were found in the possession of Manuel San&nbsp; Jose.<br><br>Ninth.&nbsp; That later Atanasio&nbsp; Claravall&nbsp; was questioned concerning the disappearance of the 75 pieces of galvanized iron from&nbsp; the storehouse;&nbsp; that&nbsp; he&nbsp; admitted&nbsp; that the defendant&nbsp; Raymundo had taken sixty pieces of the same, but claimed that the iron was delivered to him as a loan&nbsp; and&nbsp; that&nbsp; he&nbsp; had taken receipts&nbsp; which had&nbsp; been filed in the&nbsp; office of the district engineer.&nbsp; The&nbsp; office of the district engineer was examined,&nbsp; but the receipts could not be found.&nbsp; During the hunt for the said receipts, which covered considerable time, during which&nbsp; Claravall was in and out of the office&nbsp; of the district engineer, Claravall was seen taking the said receipts out of his pocket.&nbsp; The first of said alleged receipts was dated March 17, 1913, and is a receipt for 45 sheets of galvanized iron.&nbsp;&nbsp; The second is dated&nbsp; March 30, 1913, and purports&nbsp; to&nbsp; be a receipt&nbsp; for 15 sheets&nbsp; of galvanized iron.&nbsp;&nbsp; The third&nbsp; is&nbsp; dated October 31, 1912,&nbsp; and purports to be&nbsp; a receipt for a number of cart wheels, axles, etc.&nbsp; On the lower&nbsp; part of said receipt, in typewriting, there is a further memorandum dated March 17, 1913, which purports to be a receipt for 45 sheets of galvanized iron, and still another for&nbsp; 15 pieces of galvanized iron roofing.&nbsp; Granting that said receipts are genuine, Claravall has convicted himself of delivering to Raymundo, not 75 sheets of iron, but 120.&nbsp; Even granting that said receipts in part represented the galvanized iron in question, no reason&nbsp; is shown why they should&nbsp; have been dated so long after the galvanized&nbsp; iron in question&nbsp; had been&nbsp; delivered.&nbsp; No reason is given&nbsp; why&nbsp; the receipts had not been delivered at the time the iron&nbsp; was taken.<br><br>Tenth. That the said Claravall had no authority to issue property belonging to the Government, either as a loan or for any other purpose.<br><br>Eleventh. That Manuel San&nbsp; Jose&nbsp; was a contractor and carpenter&nbsp; and had taken some part&nbsp; in the construction of the camarin, located near the schoolhouse, which Raymundo was erecting upon the land of&nbsp; the defendant Claravall; that the galvanized iron was brought to him and stored beneath his house, between 4 and 6 o'clock in the morning.<br><br>Twelfth. That Cosme Rermoso and Roman&nbsp; Belo&nbsp; were carabao drivers in charge of&nbsp; the carts,&nbsp; at the time the galvanized iron was taken from the storehouse to the house of Manuel&nbsp; San Jose.<br><br>Thirteenth. That on the 16th of June, 1914, Roman Belo withdrew&nbsp; his appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp; The decision&nbsp; of&nbsp; the lower&nbsp; court therefore became final as to him.<br><br>Considering the foregoing facts, we are of the opinion and&nbsp; so declare that the said Atanasio&nbsp; Claravall, and Antonio Raymundo are guilty of the&nbsp; crime of&nbsp; larceny,&nbsp; as described&nbsp; in the complaint, and should&nbsp; be punished&nbsp; in accordance with article 517, in its relation with paragraph 3 of article 518 of the Penal Code.&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering that Atanasio Claravall was an employee of the Government,&nbsp; and the fact that he&nbsp; committed his crime at nighttime, those facts should&nbsp; be considered&nbsp; as&nbsp; aggravating&nbsp; circumstances, and the penalty imposed upon him should be one year and eight months of <span style="font-style: italic;">presidio correctional</span>, in each of said causes (10053&nbsp; and 10055), with the condition that the period of imprisonment of&nbsp; one year&nbsp; and eight&nbsp; months&nbsp; in cause No. 10055&nbsp; shall commence to be served&nbsp; immediately upon the termination of the period of imprisonment imposed in cause No.&nbsp; 10053.&nbsp;&nbsp; (U. S. <i>vs.</i> Webster, 6 Phil. Rep.,&nbsp; 393; U. S. <i>vs.</i> Wickersham, 20 Phil.&nbsp; Rep., 440.)<br><br>Considering that there were neither&nbsp; aggravating&nbsp; nor extenuating circumstances&nbsp; attending the commission of the crime, with reference to&nbsp; Antonio Raymundo, the&nbsp; penalty imposed&nbsp; upon him&nbsp; should be one year and one month of <span style="font-style: italic;">presidio correctional,</span> in each of said causes, with the provision that the penalty imposed in&nbsp; the second cause&nbsp; shall commence to be served immediately upon the termination of the first. Considering that the defendant Cosme Hermoso was&nbsp; a mere&nbsp; employee of the defendant Antonio Raymundo,&nbsp; and a cart driver, we are of the opinion and so hold that the evidence fails to show that he is guilty of the&nbsp; crime charged. The sentence&nbsp; of the lower court as to him is therefore hereby revoked, with costs <i>de officio</i>.<br><br>Considering that the proof shows&nbsp; that Manuel&nbsp; San&nbsp; Jose was guilty&nbsp; only as an accomplice, and considering the provisions of article 15,&nbsp; in its relation&nbsp; with article 68 of the Penal Code, we are of the opinion&nbsp; and so decree that he should be sentenced to pay a fine of P300 in each&nbsp; of said causes, and in case of insolvency to suffer subsidiary&nbsp; imprisonment, in accordance with&nbsp; the provisions of the law.<br><br>It is further ordered and decreed that each of the defendants,&nbsp; Atanasio&nbsp; Claravall,&nbsp; Antonio Raymundo,&nbsp; and Manuel San Jose be sentenced to pay one-fifth&nbsp; part of the costs.<br><br>In view of&nbsp; the fact that we find the&nbsp; evidence insufficient to convict&nbsp; the said Cosme Hermoso, and considering the fact that his culpability was the same as that of Roman Belo, and considering the fact that Roman Belo has withdrawn his&nbsp; appeal, we&nbsp; do hereby call the attention of the Governor-General to said facts, for the purpose of having him consider the advisibility&nbsp; of issuing a pardon to the said Belo.<br><br>With the foregoing modifications,&nbsp; the sentence&nbsp; of the lower court is hereby affirmed.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Carson,</i> and <i>Araullo, JJ.,</i> concur.<br></div>
