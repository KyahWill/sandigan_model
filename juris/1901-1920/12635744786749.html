				<H3>ANTONIO TORRES Y ROXAS AND THE INTERNATIONAL BANK ET AL.,  APPELLEES, VS. RAMON B. GENATO (INTER VENOR), APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>It appears from the record in this case that on the 29th of October, 1903, Antonio Torres and Simon Selmeer entered into articles of copartnership for the purpose of conducting the business known as the New Oriente Hotel; that the new firm became the owner of  the furniture in the said, hotel and  of a lease on the buildingwherein it was conducted, together with other valuable property; that on the 9th of December, 1903, the copartnership borrowed 20,000 pesos from the International  I Sank, and executed or undertook to execute a conveyance of certain partnership property to one Jose Kobles Lahesa as security for this loan; that on the 25th of August, 1904, one of the partners, Antonio  Torres, filed a complaint, making his partner, Simon Schneer, the  International  Bank,  and  the  said Lahesa parties defendant, praying that the a If airs of the partnership be wound  up, the  partnership property sold, the debts  paid, and the proceeds distributed to  the interested parties; that in the course of the proceedings had on this complaint the appellant, Ramon Genato, was permitted to intervene and that he filed his complaint,'alleging that the partnership was indebted to him in  the sum  of 572 pesos, Mexican currency, being the purchase price  of certain  chairs purchased by the partnership  in the month of December, 1903; that on the 22d of August, 1905, without hearing evidence as to the facts set out in the complaint, the court ordered its dismissal on the ground that it failed to set out "an interest  in  the  matter in  litigation, or in the  success of either party, or an interest against  both," as required by section 121 of the  Code of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p>We are of opinion that the trial court erred in holding that the complaint of the appellant did not set out a "legal interest in the matter in litigation" in the proceedings for the winding up of the affairs of the partnership.</p>
<p>The complaint alleges that some time in the month of December, 1903, the intervenor sold a number of chairs to the partnership for the  sum of 572  pesos, Mexican  currency, and that the purchase price has never been paid. Article 1922 of the Civil Code provides that:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Con relacion a determinados bienes muebles del deudor, gozan de preferencia:</p>
  <p>"1.Â° Los creditos por construccion, reparation, conservation o precio de venta de bienes muebles que esten en poder del deudor,  hasta donde alcancen el valor de  los mismos."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence, if it appear that these  chairs continued in the possession of the partnership, the vendor had a right to a preference in  the distribution of the proceeds of the sale of these chairs in the  course of the proceedings for the settlement and winding up of the affairs of the partnership.</p>
<p>The trial court appears to have been of opinion that these chairs passed  beyond  the  control  of  the purchaser  on December  9, 1903, by virtue of  the alleged conveyance to the said Lahesa as security or pledge for the loan from the International Bank of certain property of the partnership; but this is a question of fact, which is denied by the intervenor, and as to which he is entitled to  be heard in any proceeding for the sale of these chairs and the distribution of the proceeds of such  sale.</p>
<p>The vendor insists that these  chairs are not included in the inventory of the property conveyed to the International Bank and  there is nothing in the record to show whether this contention is well founded or not, and since he alleges that the chairs were  sold by him to the  partnership and were in its control in December, 1903, and this allegation is not denied, they must be presumed to have continued in the possession and control of the partnership until the contrary appears.   (Code of Civil Procedure, subsection 30, section 334.)</p>
<p>The order of the trial court dismissing the complaint in intervention of Ramon Genato is reversed, without special condemnation of costs, and after twenty days judgment will be entered in accordance herewith and  ten days thereafter the record will be returned to the court from whence  it came here on appeal for proper procedure.   So ordered.</p>
