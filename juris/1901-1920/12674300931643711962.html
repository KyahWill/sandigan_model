				<BR><BR><p></p><div align="justify">In this case the defendants, Marcelino Rivera, Quirico T. Palma, and Mar Carmen Catu were sentenced to four years, two years eleven months and ten days, and one year eight months and twenty-one days, respectively, of&nbsp; <em>prision correccional,</em>&nbsp; and each to pay&nbsp; one-third&nbsp; the costs&nbsp; of the for the crime of&nbsp; <em>estafa. </em> Rivera and Palma appealed and have presented separate&nbsp; briefs.<p>Counsel for Palma&nbsp; insists&nbsp; that the court erred&nbsp; (<em>a</em>)&nbsp; in permitting prosecuting attorney to file an amended complaint for the crime of <em> estafa</em>;&nbsp; (<em>b</em>)&nbsp; in finding that the proofs presented&nbsp; establish of&nbsp; this appellant beyond&nbsp; a reasonable doubt; and&nbsp; (<em>c</em>) in&nbsp; finding that the facts alleged and established constitute the crime of <em>estafa </em>Counsel for appellant Rivera alleges that&nbsp; the&nbsp; court erred in admitting considering in this case the testimony presented in the former trial for falsification of a public document.&nbsp; Two other errors are alleged which the same as (<em>b</em>) and (<em>c</em>), <em>supra.</em></p><p>The two appellants were tried separately, but in view of the fact that t evidence in&nbsp; each case&nbsp; is the same, they will be considered together in instance.</p><p>After a careful&nbsp; reading of the record in this case we are of opinion that the guilt of the appellants is fully established. The facts&nbsp; necessary t disposition of the&nbsp; case are as follows:&nbsp; The defendants in a&nbsp; certain case desired to procure an appeal bond in order to stay execution of the judgment rendered against them pending an appeal to this court.&nbsp; For this purpose one Yuen&nbsp; Chi Hin approached Rivera for assistance.&nbsp; Rivera to this Chinaman to Palma and it was agreed between the three that a bond in the amount desired, P5,600, would be furnished for 5 per cent of its value.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rivera and&nbsp; Palma had possession of tax receipts amounting to nearly&nbsp; P30,000, covering property located at San Miguel de Mayumo, Province of Bulacan, and belonging to one Anastacia Dasig.&nbsp; They persuaded the defendant Maria Carmen Catu to appear before the court with these papers, declare herself to be Anastacia&nbsp; Dasig, and sign the appeal bond such person.&nbsp; This plan was carried out, the bond was accepted by the court, and the Chinaman delivered to the appellants Palma and Rivera a check payable&nbsp; to&nbsp; bearer for the sum of P3,000.&nbsp; These appellants took the check to the&nbsp; bank the same day&nbsp; the bond was executed and cashed it, it bearing the indorsement of the defendant Palma.&nbsp; The civil case w duly elevated to this Supreme Court, where the decision of the lower court was affirmed and&nbsp; plaintiffs&nbsp; awarded judgment in the&nbsp; sum of P5,000 wit costs in&nbsp; both instances.&nbsp;&nbsp; The cause being remanded for execution, the sheriff, was unable to find the defendants&nbsp; in that civil case or any pr of theirs upon which he could levy, and the&nbsp; plaintiffs&nbsp; thereupon moved against the&nbsp; sureties on the appeal bond.&nbsp; Process was first issued against Lim Suaco, the&nbsp; other&nbsp; surety on the&nbsp; bond, but&nbsp; was&nbsp; returned&nbsp; unsatisfied with the statement&nbsp; by the sheriff that this party declared&nbsp; himself unable meet the judgment.&nbsp; Several days later Anastacia Dasig presented a motion to the court in which she denied that she&nbsp; had signed the bond and requested that it be annulled as to&nbsp; her.&nbsp; This motion was denied, but subsequently thereto this person in a separate civil action succeeded in the bond annulled as to her.&nbsp;&nbsp; The plaintiffs in the civil case were the remediless,&nbsp; and&nbsp; unable to recover&nbsp; their judgment.&nbsp; Upon Anastacia Dasig's appearance&nbsp; in court with a denial of having signed the bond, criminal proceedings were promptly instituted against .the defendants in the case bar&nbsp; upon a charge of falsification of a public document, and they were convicted of the&nbsp; crime&nbsp; charged and&nbsp; sentenced&nbsp; to various terms&nbsp; of imprisonment.&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently thereto, a new trial was granted and shortly thereafter the prosecuting attorney presented a&nbsp; new or amended complain in which the&nbsp; same defendants were&nbsp; charged&nbsp; with&nbsp; the crime of <em>estafa </em> This new complaint was based upon the same facts as the&nbsp; former one for falsification of a&nbsp; public document.&nbsp; On the same day that the new complaint charging the defendants with the&nbsp; crime of <em>estafa</em> was f the following order was entered:</p><blockquote><p>'I hereby certify that the accused Marcelino Rivera, Quirico T. Palma, a Maria Carmen&nbsp; Catu,&nbsp; attended by their counsel, Messrs. McDonough and Sa before this court in public session agreed to the presentation by the as prosecuting attorney, Mr.&nbsp; Paredes, of an amended complaint in this cause for the crime of <em>estafa;</em> and the said amended complaint having be read to the accused, Maria Carmen Catti pleaded 'guilty';&nbsp; Marcelino&nbsp; Rivera and&nbsp; Quirico&nbsp; T. Palma pleaded 'not guilty.'"</p></blockquote><p>Palma having agreed to the substitution of the new complaint, he cannot now claim that the court erred in allowing such substitution.&nbsp;&nbsp; The other appellant does not claim that the court erred upon this point.</p><p>The case upon the new complaint proceeded to trial&nbsp; on November 21, 1910 The prosecuting attorney then offered all of the evidence adduced against Rivera and Palma&nbsp; at the former trial.&nbsp;&nbsp; To this Palma said:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"I have no objection to this&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; presented by the prosecuting attorney but I desire to be tried separately."</p></blockquote><p>Rivera said nothing when this offer was made, but he did object to the presentation&nbsp; of Exhibits F, G, and H,&nbsp; which are&nbsp; certain orders issued civil case.&nbsp; After the introduction of the foregoing testimony, witnesse called and&nbsp; examined both by the prosecution and the appellants in their respective separate trials.&nbsp; Rivera, near the close of his second trial, counsel, made the following&nbsp; offer:</p><blockquote><p>"I will offer the whole evidence of the defense for defendant Rivera on former&nbsp; trial."</p></blockquote><p>The prosecuting attorney then said:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"I wish to&nbsp; offer all the&nbsp; rebuttal evidence offered on that trial."</p></blockquote><p>This evidence was received without objection.&nbsp; The appellant Rivera not did not object to the introduction of the testimony taken at the former but he himself offered a part of that testimony, which was admitted without objection.&nbsp; He cannot now complain or claim that the court erred admitting that testimony.</p><p>There remains to be disposed of the exception&nbsp; taken by counsel for bot appellants&nbsp; that the facts above stated do not constitute <em>estafa.</em></p><p>The first argument of counsel for Palma on this point is that the name u by Maria Carmen Catu&nbsp; in&nbsp; executing the bond was not a fictitious name a required&nbsp; by the provisions&nbsp; of the&nbsp; first paragraph of&nbsp; article&nbsp; 535 of Penal Code, and that therefore one of the essential elements of the&nbsp; cri of <em>estafa</em> was missing.&nbsp; This&nbsp; argument&nbsp; is without force for the that other means than the use of a fictitious name may&nbsp; be used to commit the crime of <em>estafa</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The article reads:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"ART; 535. The penalties prescribed by the next preceding article shall imposed upon:</p><p>"1. Any person who shall&nbsp; defraud another by the use of any fictitious n or by&nbsp; falsely pretending&nbsp; to possess any power, influence, qualification property, credit, agency, or business,&nbsp; or by means&nbsp; of any similar deceit other than those hereinafter enumerated."</p></blockquote><p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p><p>It will be noted that this provision of law specifies that <em> estafa</em> may be committed "by falsely pretending to possess any *&nbsp; *&nbsp; * property," which exactly covers the case at bar.&nbsp; Maria Carmen Catu went before the court and stated that she was the owner of certain property which has been proved to belong to another.&nbsp; We are not, therefore, obliged to discuss whether she did use a fictitious name within the meaning of the law. <!-- committed "by falsely pretending to possess any  *   *  *  property,"  w exactly covers the case at bar.  Maria Carmen Catd went before the court and stated that she was the owner of certain property which has been proved to belong to another.  We are not, therefore, obliged to  discuss whether she did  use  a fictitious name within the meaning of the law.</p--></p><p>Counsel for both appellants then object that a <span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie</span> case has not been made out against the appellants in that it is not shown that the bank had been unable to realize upon the bond up to the date of&nbsp; the trial of these appellants. The lower court said:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"An execution against the judgment debtor was returned unsatisfied on April 13 of the present year, and later in the same month a similar return was made as to the one surety whose signature to&nbsp; the bond in question is found to be genuine.&nbsp; Moreover, an attempt to realize against the other surety resulted&nbsp; in the showing that said instrument was never executed her, but that the pretended execution was fraudulent,&nbsp; as found by the judge&nbsp; in the decision above quoted from, and which was&nbsp; the theory adopted by the judge who suspended execution against&nbsp; said surety by the order of July 26,&nbsp; 1910, in said civil cause No. 6898, as well&nbsp; as by an of the same judge on November 5, 1910."</p></blockquote><p>The records referred to in the above quotation were all introduced as exhibits for the Government&nbsp; in the case at bar.&nbsp; It is true that this e does not directly establish the fact that up&nbsp; to the time of the trial o defendants the plaintiffs had not been able to collect their judgment fr either their judgment debtor or from the sureties on the bond.&nbsp;&nbsp; But it circumstantial evidence of the highest order.&nbsp; By court records it is that the defendant company in that civil case had ceased business and f that reason the judgment could not be collected from it;&nbsp; and that the surety Lim Suaco refused to meet his obligation on the bond with the statement that he was unable financially to do so.&nbsp; The order of the cou dated November 5, 1910, granting a&nbsp; stay of execution as to&nbsp; Anastacia Dasig&nbsp; was based upon a&nbsp; motion presented by&nbsp; that&nbsp; person&nbsp; in which she denied either signing the bond or authorizing anyone to sign it for her; on the trial of the defendants in&nbsp; this criminal case it was conclusively that she did not sign the same.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the first trial&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant this case, the surety Lim Suaco testified&nbsp; that he was&nbsp; still unable to obligation in the&nbsp; bond.&nbsp; There is not a shred of evidence in the record tending to weaken the "only logical conclusion to be reached from a consideration of these orders and&nbsp; the&nbsp; declarations of Anastacia Dasig Lim Suaco on the trial of the appellants.&nbsp;&nbsp; To sustain the argument&nbsp; o counsel that the&nbsp; plaintiffs in the&nbsp; civil case for aught the record show have or might have collected their judgment, we should be compelled to reestablish their defendants in business with&nbsp; sufficient attachable pro satisfy&nbsp; the bond; to credit the surety Lim Suaco with an accumulation w a period of five months of from P5,000 to&nbsp; P6,000; or to overturn the evidence which has so conclusively&nbsp; pointed to the trickery of the defendants and hold that Anastacia Dasig did sign the bond, and that in the interim between November 5, 1910, and&nbsp; December 29,1910, she confessed her participation therein and allowed process to issue against her property. vague probabilities or&nbsp; rather possibilities certainly do not amount to reasonable&nbsp; doubt&nbsp; of the fact that plaintiffs in&nbsp; the civil case were time of the trial, and are at this time for that matter, unable to collect their judgment.&nbsp; It is true that the burden of proving a defendant guilty of t crime charged rests upon the prosecution at all stages of the trial. Tho the defendant does not offer so much as a scintilla of evidence in his o defense, it is&nbsp; incumbent upon the Government to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. But the presumption of innocence with which the prison favored&nbsp; may be overcome by convincing evidence of his guilt, and. when such evidence has been&nbsp; presented&nbsp; by the prosecution, his continued silence no bar to&nbsp; its consideration.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is then incumbent upon the defendant would maintain his innocence to bring forth the&nbsp; proofs which will demolish the case made by the Government.&nbsp; To indulge, under such circumstances, conjecture and vague probabilities will not supply the absence of mater evidence clearly within his power to&nbsp; produce.&nbsp; In the case&nbsp; at bar it w certainly the&nbsp; duty of the prosecution&nbsp; to prove the ultimate fact that plaintiffs in the civil case&nbsp; were still holding their unsatisfied judgment time of the trial of the defendants in this criminal case.&nbsp;&nbsp; It would ha eminently&nbsp; proper&nbsp; for the Government to&nbsp; have introduced direct testimony in support of this fact.&nbsp;&nbsp; But in this case, the collateral proof of the appears to us&nbsp; just as satisfactory and conclusive as positive testimony be.&nbsp; The appellants did not attempt&nbsp; to&nbsp; controvert&nbsp; this damaging: evidence, which, had it been possible, they could very easily have done. are clearly of opinion that the prosecution has established this fact be any question of a doubt.</p><p>It is further urged that the pecuniary loss suffered by the&nbsp; plaintiff b not been ascertained.&nbsp; Exhibit F, which is&nbsp; the order of execution issue against the surety Lim Suaco, shows the amount due from the bondsmen to be P5,133.39.&nbsp; In this amount is included a certain number of small item costs which the bank could not have received, but the net amount due the bank and which it lost by reason of the presentation of the bogus bond amounts to P5,088.56.</p><p>According to the settled doctrine of this court, the essential&nbsp; elements the&nbsp; crime of <span style="font-style: italic;">estafa </span>are&nbsp; (1) the&nbsp; deceit employed to defraud another, a (2)&nbsp; the injury or damage caused&nbsp; thereby.&nbsp; Both elements must be&nbsp; present in order to sustain a conviction for such crime.&nbsp; (United States <em>vs.</em> 5&nbsp; Phil. Rep., 370;&nbsp; United&nbsp; States&nbsp; <em>vs.</em> Leano et al., 6 Phil. Rep. 370; United States vs. Leaño et al., 6 Phil. Rep., 368.) It is evident, as we have&nbsp; said, that deceit&nbsp; was employed&nbsp; by the appellant which caused the injury to the plaintiff bank.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact that the gain derived by the appellants as a result of their fraudulent acts was not p by the injured party in this case is&nbsp; of no consequence.&nbsp; The&nbsp; defendant the&nbsp; civil suit&nbsp; agreed to&nbsp; pay a fixed amount if the appellants&nbsp; would secure&nbsp; bondsmen acceptable to the court.&nbsp; The bondsmen presented by the appellants were accepted and P300 paid.&nbsp; The parties who paid the P300 lost nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp; They received&nbsp; full consideration&nbsp; for this amount.&nbsp; But plaintiff bank suffered the injury.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; gain does not necessarily ha come from the injured&nbsp; party.</p><p>The judgment appealed from being strictly in accordance with the law and the merits of the&nbsp; case, the same is hereby affirmed, with&nbsp; costs against appellants.</p><p><em> Arellano, C.&nbsp; J.,&nbsp; Torres, Mapa, Carson</em>, and <em>Moreland, JJ</em>.,concur. </p></div>
