				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> The defendants,  Isidro Paddit, Marcelino Lozano, and Julian  Serios, are accused of robbery <em>en cuadrilla,</em> resulting in homicide, in the following manner:  The defendants on a night in November, 1900, in the town of San Nicolas, presented themselves  at the house  of Jacob de la Cruz, and after having tied him  carried him to a place where the deceased had hidden a  certain package, the property of  Don Gregorio Mejia, which  contained various articles and jewelry, and there committed  the robbery  and the killing of the deceased.   The defendants were found guilty under the provisions of article 503, Penal Code, and the penalty of death  was  imposed upon them, from which judgment they have taken an appeal  to this court.  It was proven  at the trial that on the night in question, on the occasion of the  entering into the pueblo of the American Army, four persons armed  with guns and bolos went to the house of the deceased,  Jacob de  la Cruz,  and after binding his hands carried him off.  Nicolasa Valdez, the widow of  the deceased, testified that the three defendants were the persons who  came to  the house and commanded her husband to  come  downstairs.  She lit a candle and went with her husband and  recognized these three defendants; that she knew the three  men because they lived in the same pueblo and barrio in which she was living; that the defendant Marcelino Lozano was a neighbor;  that she had known him since her childhood;  that  in  the month of November one Gregorio Mejia, on account of  the confidence which he had in her husband, confided to his keeping a package containing the articles mentioned;  that the defendants  knew her husband was  keeping the property of Gregorio Mejia because they saw the property when it was brought to his house; that she supposed they killed her husband in order that he might not report  the matter to the authorities.  That she knew they were killing her husband after taking him away, because he called to her aloud just before they succeeded in killing him in a phrase used by the natives in bidding goodbye just before death; that about one hour and a half afterwards,  on  the return of her father, she told him what had happened, and they immediately went out and  found  the body of Jacob de la Cruz.   He had five wounds on the breast and one on the back near the spinal column; it was east of the  house that her husband was killed, near the place where the  package was buried.  She went to look for the package next day after her husband was killed and found that it was gone.</p>
<p> This  witness was corroborated in her statements, as to the carrying off of her husband on  the night in question, by Gregorio Mejia, Vicenta Valdez, and Lorenza  Javellana, and as to the finding of the body and the character of the wounds which had been inflicted upon him and the disappearance of the articles  mentioned.  The defense offered the witnesses Joaquin Martinez; Eugenia Vicente, wife of Isidro Paddit; Juana Bibat and Oiriaca Serios, wife and daughter  of Julian  Serios,  who  testified that the three defendants were, during the whole month of November, in their respective houses; Paddit in the barrio of  Santo Tomas, and Lozano and Serios in the same barrio in which the occurrence  took  place.   We give no credence to the proof of <em>alibi</em> by these witnesses for the defendant.</p>
<p> If the charge had been murder (<em>asesinato</em>) the evidence would have  been entirely sufficient to sustain the charge as qualified by  alevosla, with the  aggravating  circumstances  of nocturnity, and the sentence fof the court to the death  penalty might have been sustained, but the charge is for  robbery resulting in homicide.</p>
<p> After a careful consideration of the testimony we are inclined to believe that the offense of robbery has not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.   No  witness  saw the taking of the package by the defendants and none of the property has been found in their possession.  The property was hidden two  weeks before the occurrence;  there was no evidence as to the manner in which it was hidden nor whether it remained at the place or was seen there at any time from the time it was placed there two weeks previous to the time of its disappearance.</p>
<p> By the  provisions of section 29, General Orders, No. 58, a defendant may be found guilty of any offense the crime of which  is necessarily' included in the charge  under the complaint and information.</p>
<p> The offense of homicide is included in the  offense of robbery resulting in homicide, and we find the defendants guilty of  homicide with the aggravating circumstance of nocturnity,  which is punishable under article  404,  with seventeen years and four months <em>reclusion temporal </em>in its medium  degree.  The judgment of  the  Court of First Instance  is reversed and the defendants are  each now sentenced to seventeen years four months and one day of reclusidn temporal in its medium degree, with indemnification of 1,000 pesos, Mexican, to the family of deceased, and costs  of suit.</p>
<p> <em> Arellano, C. J., Torres, Willard,</em> and <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p> <em>Smith </em>and <em>Mapa, JJ.,</em> did not sit in this case.</p>
