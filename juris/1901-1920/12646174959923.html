				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The defendants are charged with the crime of  insurrection. According to the complaint,  "early in the morning of  May 30,  1902,  the defendants,  together  with several other persons armed with rifles, revolvers, and bolos, entered the town of Binangonan,  Province of  Rizal, and incited its inhabitants to rebel against the authority of the United States in these Islands."</p>
<p>From the evidence introduced at the trial  it appears that on the morning of May 30,  1902, an  armed band composed of some  fifteen men, according to some of the witnesses, and of over forty, according to others, entered the town  of Binangonan and kidnaped Don  Jos6 Suares, the municipal president; Don Jose" Tupas, provincial secretary, who happened to be in the town; Don Sixto  Angeles, president  of the board of health; Don Lazaro Gergaray, and an American  whose name does not appear.  These people were led along the road toward the town of  Carmona; but  when the party had  covered about  half  the distance  to the town three American  soldiers were encountered.  In the course of the fight which ensued, and as a result  of the  confusion thereby produced, the prisoners succeeded in  escaping from their captors.</p>
<p>These are the only facts shown in the record.  It does not even appear what motive led the defendants to kidnap the persons mentioned.  This  act of  simple kidnaping, without evidence as  to previous or  attendant  circumstances, without data of any kind, in short, to  indicate the motive or purpose  for which the act was committed, is the one bare fact which we find established in the record. As to  promoting or inciting to rebellion,  with which the defendants are specifically charged in the information, not only does the record contain no  proof of their guilt of this crime  but absolutely no attempt has been made to  prove it.   It follows,  therefore, that the accusation fails  in its most essential point—that is, with respect to the act complained of, and which  alone could make  the defendants guilty of the crime  of  insurrection with which they are charged.</p>
<p>The kidnaping of the persons above mentioned, upon the supposition that there is nothing which would authorize us  to attribute to it  any special or determinate character, may have been committed with purposes entirely different from those which, under Act No. 292  of  the Civil  Commission, characterize the crime of rebellion.   It may have been done simply for the purpose of obtaining money, by holding the prisoners  for ransom, or for  the purpose of executing upon  them acts of personal revenge. There is no  evidence that the kidnapers  had any other purpose in view.  Still less does it  appear  that they had the specific intent of thereby inciting anyone to  rebellion, or of promoting a rebellion,  as alleged  in the information.   This act of kidnaping, as it appears in the record, might perhaps constitute the crime  of illegal detention or some offense of a similar character,  but  it can not by any possibility constitute the crime of insurrection, with which the defendants are specifically charged.</p>
<p>The  evidence  adduced at the trial does not prove the commission of the offense complained of.   This being the case, it is unnecessary for us to make any examination into the participation which  the defendants may have had in the execution of the kidnaping  referred to.   Even if the evidence shows  the  commission of such an act, we can not convict them for that offense in the present action, because that would be equivalent to imposing upon them a  conviction for a crime  with which they have not been charged—a proceeding in  violation of right and justice.</p>
<p>For the reasons stated, we reverse the  judgment below and acquit the defendants, without prejudice to an action expressly  reserved to the prosecuting,  attorney,  brought upon a new information based on the facts established  in this case.   The costs of  both  instances  are declared <em>de oficio</em>.</p>
<p><em> Arellano, C. J., Cooper, McDonough,</em>  and <em>Johnson, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em> Torres </em>and <em>Willard, JJ.,</em> dissenting :</p>
<p>We are of  the  opinion that the  defendants  should be convicted of the crime of insurrection charged in the information,  under section 3 of Act No. 292, passed November 4, 1901, as the acts committed by the defendants are properly classed as constituting the offense of insurrection.</p>
