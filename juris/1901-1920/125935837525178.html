				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE, VS. CIRIACO BALUYUT ET AL, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>SMITH, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> Ciriaco Baluyut,  Felipe  Duban,  Camilo Angeles, and Cenon Patdu were charged in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Pampanga with having gradually and furtively made away with three gold buttons, two  silver ones, a few razors,  a  watch, an umbrella, a ring, and a general assortment of more or less useful wearing apparel. The complaint neglects to state who owned  the property abstracted, but  for  the purposes of this case it will be assumed that it did not belong to the accused.</p>
<p> To enable the fiscal to utilize them as witnesses for the State the charge was dismissed on the trial  as to all  the defendants except Ciriaco Baluyut, who was found guilty of having stolen from the house in which he was employed as cook one razor of  the value of $2.70.  In the opinion of the trial court this disregard of the property rights of his master constituted the crime of domestic theft, and  Baluyut was therefore sentenced to one year and a day of <em>presidio correccional;</em> and the  usual accessories.</p>
<p> From the  judgment Baluyut  appealed to this court, and the only question raised by the record is the sufficiency and competency  of the evidence  on which his conviction was secured. The Attorney-General recommends that the judgment of conviction be reversed, and we are of the opinion that his recommendation is well founded.  The  only evidence against the defendant is his own confession and the uncorroborated testimony of his codefendant, Camilo  Angeles. Unfortunately  the confession seems  to  have been made under such circumstances as to  raise the presumption that it was induced by fear of physical violence,  and that it was not of such a free and voluntary character as to give it weight and value as competent evidence.  Baluyut and Angeles having been arrested on the charge, they were confined together and examined touching  the misappropriation of the property in question.   Both  at first denied having any guilty knowledge of the matter,  and persisted in  their denials  until  Camilo Angeles,  having been beaten  and buffeted  by  Epifanio Carreon,  finally admitted that he had received the razor from Baluyut in satisfaction of a debt.  Baluyut then admitted that he  had given the razor to Angeles.  That Angeles was beaten is not denied  by the prosecution, although he himself testifies that his  incriminating statement  was  "spontaneous." Inasmuch as the prosecution  carefully refrained, however, from asking him  if he had been struck before making it, and declined to examine Goodale,  Carreon,  or Reyes on the subject at all, although  they were witnesses for  the prosecution and present at the time of the  alleged beating, it is reasonably safe to assume that any spontaneity on the part of Angeles was accomplished by the strenuous measures described by defendant and his witness,  Gutchillan.</p>
<p> No physical violence appears to have been visited upon Baluyut himself, yet, for all that,  his confession made under the  circumstances set out in the record must be excluded from consideration  by the court for the lack of that free and voluntary character which would otherwise give it value as evidence.  The physical violence to his co-defendant,  inflicted within his hearing, and  almost in his immediate presence, to force a damaging admission, was as much an intimidation of the appellant, as much a warning to him  of what he might expect under like circumstances, as if he had been  openly threatened with similar ill treatment should he  further persist  in  his denials of guilt. That confession may have any weight whatever with courts of justice, as legal proof, it is absolutely necessary that they should be freely and voluntarily made.  If they are brought about  by menace, threat, or intimidation or by a promise of reward or even  of leniency they are stripped of the only element which makes them valuable to courts in determining  the truth.  With this confession out of the way the only evidence remaining against the defendant is the testimony of Angeles to  the effect that Baluyut sold him the razor.   The testimony of this witness standing alone  and uncorroborated by other competent evidence does not convince the court of the guilt of the accused to a moral  certainty and beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p> The testimony of this witness is a substantial repetition of the  statement obtained from him as the result of physical violence and  force.  It is impeached by the  witness Batac, who testifies that Angeles informed him before the arrest  that an American had given him  (Angeles)  the razor to sell. It is weakened by the fact that the prosecution failed to call Eulalio Razon or Pedro to corroborate Angeles's statement that the razor had been given to him by Baluyut in their presence. It is  unreliable because  of the character of the witness, who is shown by the evidence to have stolen the cochero's watch, which he only returned after being threatened with  prosecution for the theft by Mr. Goodale.</p>
<p> For  these reasons the unsupported evidence of his codefendant is not  sufficient to warrant a conviction of the appellant. The  judgment  of the lower court  must therefore  be reversed, arid the defendant acquitted  of the charge, with with costs <em>de oficio.</em> So ordered.</p>
<p> <em>Arellano, C. J., Cooper, Willard, Mapa</em> and <em>Ladd, JJ., </em>concur.</p>
<p> <em>Torres, J.,</em>withdrew from  this case.</p>
