				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Judgment in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of 984.66 pesos, with interest at the rate of 6 per cent from the 19th day of November, 1902, was  rendered in the trial court upon  the  following  findings of  fact, which are fully sustained by the evidence of record:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"First. That Manuel Escudero, deceased, pawned certain jewelry on the Oth day of September, 1898, in the 'Monte de Piedad' for the sum of 700 pesos;</p>
  <p>"Second. That the said Escudero died on the 26th  day of March, 1899, without having redeemed this  jewelry;</p>
  <p>"Third. That the said Escudero executed a will in which he named the plaintiff as his albacea (executrix) ; that the said will was duly probated and that the plaintiff accepted the said appointment as albacea;</p>
  <p>"Fourth. That subsequently, and after the  period prescribed for the redemption of said jewelry had expired, the defendant sold the said jewelry at public  auction in accordance with the rules provided in such cases, and applied the proceeds to the payment of the said loan of 700 pesos, interest, and costs of the auction, placing the balance of 984 pesos and (Hi cents to the credit of Escudero;</p>
  <p>"Fifth. That some time in the month of November, 1900, some one unknown, impersonating the  said Manuel Escudero, deceased,  presented himself to the defendant and stated that he was Manuel Escudero and that he had been a  prisoner in the hands  of the  Filipinos, who had  destroyed his pawn tickets; that this unknown person requested that he  be informed what was necessary for him to do in order to withdraw the amount which he claimed to have to his credit in the said  'Monte de Piedad;' that he was  informed that  he must submit a statement in writing setting out the contents of the pawn tickets which had been destroyed; that some days afterwards he returned, giving the description of  the  said jewelry; that the  customary notice was duly published and  that on the  1st day  of, February, 3901, the prescribed period of sixty days having expired and no protest having been submitted, six duplicate  pawn tickets were issued to the said unknown individual who was impersonating  the deceased Escudero; and that on the 11th day of February, 1901, the defendant paid to him the sum of 474 pesos and 5 cents, and on the 12th day of the same month and year the sum of 510 pesos and 61 cents; and</p>
  <p>"Sixth. That at the time when this payment was  made Manuel Escudero was dead and that the said payment was not made to his lawful representative nor to any other duly authorized person."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Counsel for defendant insists that judgment should have been rendered in his favor because, as he alleges, the proceedings in connection with the issuance of the duplicate pawn tickets were had in exact conformance with the statutes of the establishment of which he was director and the payment made upon these  duplicate  pawn tickets relieved him and his establishment of all responsibility, in accordance with the provisions of article 1873 of the Civil Code, which provides that:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Respecto a los Montes de Piedad y deinas establecimientos ptiblicos, que por instituto o profesion  prestan  sobre prendas, se observaran las leyes y reglamentos especiales que les conciernan y subsidiariamente las disposiciones de este titulo."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The record  discloses that  under, the statutes of the "Monte de Piedad y Caja de Ahorros" of Manila all articles pawned are  required to be held in safe-keeping for one year and, if within that period the original pawn tickets are not presented, such articles are to  be  sold at public auction ,and the proceeds applied to the  reimbursement of the establishment for the amount  loaned, together  with interest and  expenses lawfully incurred, any balance remaining  to be placed to the credit of the account of the holder of the pawn ticket and to remain to his credit for a period of ten years, when such funds become the property of the establishment if within  that period the pawn ticket has not been presented and  demand  made for  the balance to the credit  of the holder.</p>
<p>At the time when these jewels were pledged there was a rule of the establishment, approved by a statute of the Consejo de Administracion, which authorized the issuance of duplicate pawn tickets to persons claiming to have lost originals, when such persons could produce satisfactory evidence of ownership of the lost tickets, and after due notice published in the public press for a certain prescribed number of days.  Subsequently, on the 1st day of September,  1899, a new rule appears  to have  been adopted by which notices of claims on account of  alleged losses  of pawn tickets and applications for duplicates were not published in the public press unless the party claiming to have lost the pawn tickets assumed the  expense of such publication, and in lieu thereof notices were posted at some public place within the establishment.</p>
<p>The proceedings  in the case under consideration were had in accordance with this new rule, and it is claimed that this rule was duly authorized  by the statutes of the establishment, and. that compliance therewith relieved the defendant of responsibility for all losses arising thereunder. It is  not nec&amp;ssary for us to consider whether the defendant would have been relieved from responsibility  in this case if such rule had been duly authorized by a statute of the establishment, because it  does not appear of record that the new rule was, in fact, authorized or approved, and it was the duty of  the defendant  who claimed exemption thereunder to submit proof in  support of this allegation.</p>
<p>Article 14 of the statutes of the Monte de Piedad is as follows:</p>
<p>"Son atribuciones del Consejo:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"1.<sup>a</sup> Dictar disposiciones que eonceptue necesarias para la ejecucion de estos estatutos, aprobando los reglamentos por los cuales se haya de regir el establecimiento.</p>
  <p>"3.<sup>a</sup> Resolver cuantas dudas y cuestiones se presenten en la marcha ordenada del servicio, y para las cuales no est&amp; facultada la Junta de Gobierno o el Director  gerente." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only competent evidence of record showing the adoption or approval by the council of administration of rules touching  the mode of procedure  in  cases where loss of pawn tickets is alleged consists of extracts from the record of sessions of that body held on the 16th of  March, 1883, and December 6, 1887, wherein  the mode of  procedure in force  at that time, including publication in  the  public press, was authorized and approved, but the change of that mode of procedure as above set out did not take place until the 1st of September, 1899, as appears from the evidence introduced by the defendant himself, and there  is no evidence  whatever to  show that this change was authorized or approved by the Consejo de Adnivtrist radon.</p>
<p>It is by no means improbable that  had the defendant adhered strictly to the authorized and approved rules  of his establishment,  and had notice of the application for duplicate pawn tickets been published in some newspaper circulating in the city of Manila, the holder of the original tickets would have entered protest, and thus the improper payment of the balance  due the holder of these tickets would have been avoided, and however this may be, we are of opinion that the defendant  having failed to comply with the provisions of the authorized and approved rules of his establishment, his claim for  exemption under and by virtue of those rules can not  be considered.</p>
<p>The judgment of the trial court is  affirmed,  with the costs  of  this  instance against  the appellant, and  after twenty days judgment will be entered in accordance herewith,  and ten days thereafter the record will  be returned to the trial court for execution.   So  ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa,  Willard, </em>and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em>Johnson, J.,</em> did not sit in this case.<br>
