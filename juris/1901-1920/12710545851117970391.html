				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of the Province of Cagayan, Hon. Charles A. Low presiding, convicting the defendant of the crime of malversation of public funds and sentencing&nbsp; him to&nbsp; two months' imprisonment,&nbsp; to&nbsp; perpetual disqualification to hold&nbsp; public office or public employment of any kind,&nbsp; and to the payment of the&nbsp; costs.<br><br>It appears from the proofs&nbsp; of the&nbsp; prosecution that the accused as&nbsp; justice of&nbsp; the&nbsp; peace of Baggao,&nbsp; Province of Cagayan, on the 2d&nbsp; day of October, 1909, had before him sixteen separate civil cases commenced by Juan Canillas against sixteen distinct individuals, each&nbsp; one&nbsp; for damages resulting from a breach of contract; that said&nbsp; cases were all decided by the appellant in favor of the plaintiff; that each one of the defendants&nbsp; in&nbsp; said&nbsp; cases appealed&nbsp; from the decision of the justice of the peace and deposited P16 as required by law, at the same time giving a&nbsp; bond of P50, each one of which was approved by the court;&nbsp; that on the 12th day of said month&nbsp; the plaintiff in said&nbsp; cases presented a writing to the appellant as said justice of the peace, alleging that&nbsp; the sureties on the&nbsp; said bonds&nbsp; were insolvent and&nbsp; later demonstrated&nbsp; this to the&nbsp; satisfaction of the appellant; that thereupon the latter ordered the cancellation of the said bonds and, in the same order,&nbsp; required each of&nbsp; the appellants to file&nbsp; another bond within fifteen days; that, inasmuch as none of the appellants in&nbsp; said causes presented new bonds within the time fixed, the plaintiff&nbsp; in said causes applied to the appellant, as said court, for&nbsp; an order declaring final the&nbsp; judgment entered in each of the said sixteen&nbsp; cases&nbsp; and commanding the execution of the same, at the&nbsp; same time&nbsp; asking that the sums deposited by the defendants in&nbsp; said&nbsp; actions be attached (so called in the record) and delivered to him in satisfaction of said judgments; that the accused acceded to the petition of the plaintiff, ordered said&nbsp; sums attached and delivered same to the plaintiff, at the same time requiring of the plaintiff a bond of T50 for each attachment, conditioned that he would respond for the damages which should result from such attachment.<br><br>After&nbsp; this attachment (so&nbsp; called)&nbsp; the attorney for the defendants in the said sixteen cases presented a complaint against the appellant to the&nbsp; Court of First&nbsp; Instance, by virtue of which said&nbsp; court ordered that the plaintiff, Juan Canillas, deliver to the clerk of the Court of First Instance the sums deposited by the defendants in said actions. Canillas&nbsp; obeyed&nbsp; the order of the court and made the&nbsp; delivery as required.<br><br>Upon these&nbsp; facts&nbsp; the Acting&nbsp; Attorney-General recommends the acquittal of the accused.&nbsp; We are in entire accord with that recommendation.&nbsp; The case made&nbsp; against&nbsp; the appellant&nbsp; lacks many of the&nbsp; essential elements&nbsp; required by law to be present in the crime of malversation of public funds.&nbsp; The accused did not convert the money to his own use or to the use of any other person; neither did he feloniously permit anybody else&nbsp; to&nbsp; convert&nbsp; it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything he did was&nbsp; done in good faith under the belief that he was acting judicially and correctly.&nbsp; The fact&nbsp; that&nbsp; he&nbsp; ordered the sums, deposited in his&nbsp; hands by the&nbsp; defendants - appellants&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; sixteen&nbsp; actions referred to, attached for the benefit of the plaintiff in those actions, after the appeals had been dismissed and the judgments in his court had become&nbsp; final, and that he&nbsp; delivered the said sums to the plaintiff&nbsp; in satisfaction of the&nbsp; judgment which he held iny those cases, can not be&nbsp; considered an&nbsp; appropriation or a taking of said sums within the meaning of Act No.&nbsp; 1740. He believed that, as presiding officer of the court of justice of the peace, he had a perfect right under the law to cancel the bonds when it was clearly shown to him that the sureties thereon were insolvent, to require the filing of new undertakings,&nbsp; giving the parties ample time&nbsp; within which&nbsp; to do so, to dismiss the appeals in case said undertakings were not filed,&nbsp; and&nbsp; to&nbsp; declare the judgment final.&nbsp; He believed that after said appeals had been dismissed and said&nbsp; judgment had become final,&nbsp; the sums&nbsp; deposited were subject to be applied in payment of the judgments in the actions in which said sums had been&nbsp; deposited and that&nbsp; he was acting judicially and legally in&nbsp; making such applications.<br><br>To constitute&nbsp; a crime, the&nbsp; act must, except in certain crimes made such by statute, be accompanied by a criminal intent, or by such negligence or indifference to duty&nbsp; or to consequences,&nbsp; as, in law, is equivalent to&nbsp; criminal intent. The maxim is,<i> actus non facit reum, nisi mens&nbsp; rea </i>- a crime is not committed if the mind of the person performing the act complained of be innocent.<br><br>In the case at bar the appellant was engaged in exercising the functions of a court of justice of the&nbsp; peace.&nbsp;&nbsp; He had jurisdiction of the actions&nbsp; before&nbsp; him.&nbsp; He&nbsp; had&nbsp; a&nbsp; right and it was his duty to require the payment by each appellant of P16, as well as the giving of a proper undertaking with solvent&nbsp; sureties.&nbsp;&nbsp; While, in dismissing the appeals and delivering the P256 to the plaintiff in said cases, he may have exceeded his authority as such court and passed beyond the&nbsp; limits of&nbsp; his jurisdiction and power, a question we do not&nbsp; now discuss or decide, it was, so&nbsp; far as appears from the&nbsp; record, at most a&nbsp; pure mistake of judgment, an error of the mind operating upon a state of facts.&nbsp;&nbsp; Giving the act complained of the&nbsp; signification most detrimental to the appellant,&nbsp; it,&nbsp; nevertheless, was&nbsp; simply the result of the erroneous&nbsp; exercise of&nbsp; the judicial function, and not&nbsp; an intention to deprive any person of his&nbsp; property feloniously. His&nbsp; act had back of it the&nbsp; purpose to do justice to litigants and&nbsp; not to embezzle property.&nbsp; He acted that honest debts might be paid to those to whom they were legally and justly due, and not to enrich himself or another by criminal misappropriation.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was&nbsp; an error committed&nbsp; by a court,&nbsp; not an act done by a criminal-minded man.&nbsp; It was a mistake, not&nbsp; a crime.<br><br>It is true that a presumption of criminal&nbsp; intention&nbsp; may arise from proof of the&nbsp; commission&nbsp; of a&nbsp; criminal&nbsp; act; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; general rule is that, if&nbsp; it is&nbsp; proved that the accused committed the criminal act charged, it will be&nbsp; presumed that the act was done with criminal&nbsp; intention, and that it is for&nbsp; the accused to rebut this presumption.&nbsp;&nbsp; But it must be borne in mind that the act from which such presumption springs must&nbsp; be a <i>criminal </i>act. In the&nbsp; case before us the&nbsp; act was&nbsp; not&nbsp; <i>criminal</i>.&nbsp; It may have been an error; it may&nbsp; have been wrong and illegal in the sense that it would have been&nbsp; declared&nbsp; erroneous and set aside on appeal or other proceeding in the superior court.&nbsp; It may well&nbsp; be that his&nbsp; conduct was arbitrary to a high degree, to such a degree in fact as properly to subject him to reprimand or even suspension or removal&nbsp; from office.&nbsp; But, from the facts of record, it was not <i>criminal</i>.&nbsp; As a necessary result no presumption of criminal intention arises from the act. &nbsp;<br><br>Neither&nbsp; can the presumption&nbsp; of a criminal&nbsp; intention arise from the act complained of, even though&nbsp; it be admitted that the crime, if any, is that of malversation of public&nbsp; funds&nbsp; as defined, and&nbsp; penalized in Act&nbsp; No. 1740. It is true that that Act provides that "In all prosecutions for violations of the preceding section, the absence of any of the&nbsp; public funds or property of which any person described in&nbsp; said&nbsp; section has charge,&nbsp; and any failure or inability of such person to produce all the funds and property properly in his charge on the demand of any officer authorized to&nbsp; examine or inspect such person, office, treasury, or depositary shall be deemed to be<span style="font-style: italic;"> prima facie</span> evidence that such&nbsp; missing funds&nbsp; or&nbsp; property have&nbsp; been&nbsp; put to personal uses or used for personal ends by such&nbsp; person within&nbsp; the meaning of the preceding section."&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, that presumption is a rebuttable one and constitutes only a <i>prima facie</i>&nbsp; case against the person accused.&nbsp; If he present evidence showing that, in fact, he has not put said funds&nbsp; or property to personal uses, then&nbsp; that presumption is at an end and the <i>prima facie</i> case destroyed.&nbsp; In the case at bar it was unnecessary for the accused to offer any&nbsp; such evidence,&nbsp; for&nbsp; the reason that&nbsp; the people's own&nbsp; pleading alleged, and its own proofs presented, along with the criminal&nbsp; charge, <i>facts which showed, of themselves, that said money had not been put to personal uses or used for personal ends. </i> In other words, the prosecution&nbsp; demonstrated,&nbsp; both by the&nbsp; allegations in its information filed against the accused and by its proofs on the trial, that the absence of the funds in <i>question was not due to the personal use thereof by the accused,</i> thus affirmatively and completely negativing the presumption which, under the act quoted, arises from the absence&nbsp; of the funds.&nbsp; The&nbsp; presumption&nbsp; was never born.&nbsp;&nbsp; It never existed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The facts which were&nbsp; presented for the purpose of creating such presumption were accompanied by other facts which absolutely prevented its creation.<br><br>On the other hand, if it be admitted that the crime, if. any,&nbsp; is&nbsp; that of estafa, as defined in paragraph 5 of&nbsp; article 535 of the Penal Code, then the presumption just referred to does not arise.&nbsp; Mere absence of the funds&nbsp; is not sufficient proof of conversion.&nbsp; Neither is the mere failure of the accused to turn over the funds at any given time sufficient to make even a <i>prima facie </i>case.&nbsp; (U. S.<i> vs.</i> Morales, 15 Phil. Rep:, 238; U. S. <i>vs.</i> Dominguez, 2 Phil. Hep., 580.) Conversion must be affirmatively proved, either by&nbsp; direct evidence or&nbsp; by the production of facts from which conversion necessarily follows.&nbsp; (U. S. <i>vs.</i> Morales, <i>supra.</i>)<br><br>The judgment of conviction is reversed and the defendant ordered discharged from custody forthwith.<br><br><i> Arellano, C. J., Mapa</i> and <i>Trent, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="left"><br><center><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">CONCURRING</span><br></center><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;CARSON,&nbsp; </span><i style="font-weight: bold;">J.,</i> <br><br>I am strongly inclined to doubt the bona fides of the defendant in the transactions herein set out, but in the absence of proof beyond a reasonable doubt upon this point I concur in the judgment of acquittal of the crime charged&nbsp; in&nbsp; the information.</div>
