				<h4>
				G.R. No, 4781, October 21, 1908</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. BALTASAR SARMIENTO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>TRACEY, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In the Court of First Instance of Bohol, Baltasar Sarmiento was convicted of having, as a public officer—that is, a councilor of the municipality of Tagbilaran—been interested in&nbsp; two cockpits and a billiard hall therein, contrary to the provisions of section 28 of Act No. 82, as amended by Act No. 663.&nbsp; It is claimed by the defense that on the principle<i> cessante ratione legis, cessat et ipsa lex,</i> thin Act is rendered ineffective by the provisions of the Internal Revenue Law, Act No. 1189, which, in subdivision (<i>e</i>) of section 146 expressly repeals&nbsp; so much of paragraph&nbsp; (<i>h</i>), section 43, of Act No. 82&nbsp; as authorizes municipalities to exact licenses for cockpits, billiard tables, and so forth.&nbsp; It might be added that all the provisions of Act No. 82, authorizing taxes of this nature, fall within the general repeal of subdivision (<i>a</i>) of section 146 of Act No. 1189, affecting all laws and ordinances whereby taxes of this nature are imposed.<br><br>This argument overlooks the fact that the municipal council had other concern with cockpits and billiard,rooms than the mere licensing of them, being charged by subdivision (<i>j</i>) of section 40 of Act No, 82 with the prohibition and closing of them, which is in the nature of a police power regulation rather than one for revenue.&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, although municipal councilors may not now raise revenue from places of amusement of this character, they may, nevertheless, police and&nbsp; control them.&nbsp; Therefore, the councilman still has power over them and the reason of the law prohibiting his interest in them has not ceased by reason&nbsp; of the Internal Revenue&nbsp; Act. It&nbsp; is plain that it was unnecessary to show that the municipal council of Tagbilaran had ever&nbsp; licensed cockpits in&nbsp; order to bring them&nbsp; within the terms&nbsp; of&nbsp; Act No.&nbsp; 663, for, as cockpits are therein especially&nbsp; mentioned, they are&nbsp; not required to be covered by the phrase "or other&nbsp; permitted games and amusement whatever may be its technical&nbsp; construction. A conviction for a similar offense under the same Act was sustained by us in the case of The United States <i>vs.</i> Gray (8 Phil. Rep., 506).<br><br>The sentence of the Court of First Instance to six months of <i>prision</i>, with costs, is hereby affirmed, with the costs of this instance.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J,, Torres, Mapa, Carson,</i> and <i> Willard, JJ,,</i> concur.</div>
