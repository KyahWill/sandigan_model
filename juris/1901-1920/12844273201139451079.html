				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. MARGARITA FELICIANO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Felix Atacador filed a complaint against his wife Margarita Feliciano and one 
Pedro Velasquez, charging them with the crime of adultery. After a few witnesses 
had been called in the separate trial of Velasquez, on motion of the prosecution 
the case was dismissed. On the trial of Margarita Feliciano, she was found 
guilty and sentenced to three years six months and twenty-one days of 
<em>prision correccional</em>, with the costs. From this sentence she has 
appealed, making four assignments of error.
<p>One assignment of error is that the trial court should have dismissed the 
case against the accused in view of having dismissed the case against her 
coaccused Velasquez. The argument that the charge of adultery, necessarily under 
one complaint, is indivisible impresses one strongly. However, there is now no 
occasion to discuss this point for in the late case of U. S. <em>vs</em>. Topi√±o 
and Guzman ([1916] 35 Phil., 901,) citing the decision of the supreme court of 
Spain of January 17, 1889, it was expressly held that where a man and a woman 
are charged in the same complaint with the crime of adultery the acquittal of 
the woman does not necessarily carry with it the acquittal of the man, although 
the offense is one which can only be committed by two persons. Paraphrasing the 
language somewhat, it can now be held that under a complaint for adultery the 
acquittal of the man does not necessarily carry with it the acquittal of the 
woman because, among other reasons, the man may not have known that the woman 
was married.</p>
<p>Another assignment of error is that the husband was not competent to give 
testimony as to the pregnancy of the wife. As a general rule, the husband can 
testify against the wife in an adultery case because while adultery is in one 
sense a public crime, it can only be prosecuted with a few exceptions on the 
complaint of the aggrieved party. Adultery would therefore come within the 
provisos of section 383, paragraph 3, of the Code of Civil Procedure, as 
amended, as an action for a crime committed by the wife against the husband. 
Whether ,we can stretch the proviso to cover the testimony of the husband who 
expresses an opinion as to the pregnancy of the wife is doubtful, which, 
however, in this instance can be waived without decision.</p>
<p>The other assignments of error go to the merits of the case. The nature of 
the crime of adultery is such that it will not be often when it can be 
established by direct evidence. Nevertheless, strong circumstancial and 
corroborative evidence such as will lead the guarded discretion of a reasonable 
and just man to the conclusion that the alleged act has been committed is 
sufficient to sustain a conviction for adultery. (5 Groizard, C6digo Penal, pp. 
24 <em>et seq.;</em> decision of the supreme court of Spain of June 23, 1874; 1. 
R. C. L., par. 28,) What is the proof, direct or circumstantial, in the present 
case?</p>
<p>Margarita Feliciano, the accused, was married to the complainant Felix 
Atacador on January 15, 1911. She left her husband on February 15, 1916. During 
the months of May, June, and a part of July of the same year, she lived in a 
rented house in Manila with Pedro Velasquez. The owner, who lived in the upper 
part of the same house, considered them to be man and wife. A photograph shows 
their intimate relations. A witness testified to having seen the accused and 
Velasquez in scant apparel and sleeping together. The woman and her paramour had 
the opportunity to satisfy their adulterous inclination. We think that a finding 
to the effect that Velasquez and the accused had carnal relations is 
sufficiently in accord with the probabilities of the case and the proof.</p>
<p>The judgment of the lower court is affirmed with the addition of the 
accessory penalties and the costs. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Johnson, Carson, Araullo</em>, and <em>Street, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p></div>
