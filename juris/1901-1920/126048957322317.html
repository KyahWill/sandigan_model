				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> Santiago Solitario,  Carlos  Santiago, and Jacinto Alfonso were charged with the crime of illegal detention stated as committed in the following manner:</p>
<p> On the 29th day of September, 1901, in  the barrio of Sacumbaca, pueblo of Talavera, Province of Nueva Ecija, said defendants, armed with guns and bolos, sequestrated two youths called Abdon Somera and Modesto Balasigue, depriving them  of their liberty, the first named for the period of twenty-nine  days and the last  named for the period of four days. The defendants and  four other  individuals  constituted an armed band by whom the act was committed.</p>
<p> After the arraignment and after the  trial  was  commenced  Santiago Solitario died.  The defendants Carlos Santiago and Jacinto Alfonso were tried and found guilty and were condemned to the penalty of six years and one day of <em>prision mayor</em> and accessories, and each to pay their part of the costs of the suit.  Prom this judgment the defendants Carlos Santiago and Jacinto Alfonso appeal.</p>
<p> It is contended that the proof was insufficient to sustain the conviction, that such acts as were proven do not constitute illegal detention.</p>
<p> After a careful examination of the record we reach the conclusion that the evidence contained therein is sufficient to support the conviction.</p>
<p> Modesto Balasigue, one of the  youths  detained, testifies that on  the 24th day of September of  last year he and Abdon Somera were hunting wild hogs at the place called Sacumbaca, and  that they were sequestrated  by several individuals; that there were six  persons in  the band, all armed, some carrying  guns  and others bolos; that the defendants Carlos Santiago and  Jacinto Alfonso carried bolos; that witness was detained by the defendants  four days, when he escaped from their  custody.  At the time he escaped  Abdon  Somera was still held by them.  That he is able to identify the defendants  as being the persons  who had him in custody, since he was in their company during the time he was held by them.</p>
<p> Three municipal police testified as to the capture of the defendants and as to finding  in their possession the boy Abdon Somera and  three stolen carabaos.</p>
<p> Meliton Carlos, president of the  municipality of San Miguel de Mayumo, testified  that these  defendants  were captured by the police; that he was  in company with the police when they captured them, and that the defendants had in their possession Abdon Somera and some carabaos. This witness testifies that upon capturing the defendants they admitted that they had carried  off Abdon Somera to San Miguel de Mayumo.   The testimony of  this witness and that of the police as to the confession made by the defendants is not entirely consistent.  The  first affirms that the defendants said they carried off Abdon Somera to San Miguel de Mayumo, while the  police  indicate in their testimony that what was  said  about  the  carrying off  of Abdon  Somera  was related by Abdon  Somera himself. However, it appears very, clear from the statements  of these witnesses that Abdon Somera and the carabaos were found in the possession of the  defendants.</p>
<p> The  testimony of Modesto Balasigue is  sufficient to support the conviction independent of any  confessions  that may have  been made by the  defendants when captured. He clearly identifies the defendants as  the parties  who carried him and Abdon Somera off, and he states that after four days of detention he made his escape while  grazing the carabaos.</p>
<p> No explanation is made why  the boy Abdon  Somera was not adduced as a witness at the trial.  But, as stated, the case is fully proven by Modesto Balasigue.</p>
<p> The  judge of the Court of First Instance gave the defendants the benefit of article 11 of the Penal Code as an extenuating circumstance and  failed  to take into consideration the aggravating circumstance of  the offense hav- ing been committed by an armed band in <em>cuadrilla</em>.</p>
<p> We can see  no just, reason for giving these defendants the benefit of article 11, nor can we see any cause for not taking  into consideration the  aggravating circumstance of the act having been committed in  <em>cuadrilla</em>.  For  this reason  we will set aside the judgment of  the lower court and enter the proper judgment,  which  is,  that  the defendants Carlos  Santiago and Jacinto Alfonso are guilty of the offense of unlawful detention defined and punishable under article 481  of  the Penal  Code, and  we condemn them to the punishment of ten years and one day of <em>prision mayor</em> in its maximum degree and accessories, and to the costs of the proceedings.</p>
<p> <em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Willard, Mapa,</em> and <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
