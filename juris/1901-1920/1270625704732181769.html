				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The appellant&nbsp; in this&nbsp; case, William Boston, was, with Mateo de la Cruz, charged in the court below with the violation of section 3 of&nbsp; Act No. 619.&nbsp; That section is as follows: <br><blockquote>"Any Constabulary officer or non-commissioned officer of the Constabulary who countenances, allows, or permits the whipping, maltreatment,&nbsp; abuse, or torture of any native of the Philippine Islands or of any other person for the purpose of extorting&nbsp; or obtaining any confession, information, or declaration whatsoever shall be punished&nbsp; by imprisonment for a period not exceeding live years or&nbsp; by a fine not exceeding five&nbsp; thousand dollars, or both such fine and imprisonment, in&nbsp; the discretion of the court." </blockquote>Boston was tried separately at his request, convicted and sentenced to twenty months of imprisonment and the payment of costs.&nbsp; From this judgment he has appealed.&nbsp; It appears that the&nbsp; other defendant, Mateo de la Cruz, died on the 23d of June,&nbsp; 1906.<br><br>That the complaining&nbsp; witness, Francisco&nbsp; Garcia, was thrown upon his&nbsp; back and vinegar poured into his mouth and nose by the soldiers under the command of Boston, is not disputed.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is claimed, however,&nbsp; by the appellant that he was not present when this was done, did not order it, and had nothing to do with it; and he produced witnesses who testified that he, the appellant, was not in the building where the&nbsp; complaining witness,&nbsp; Francisco Garcia, said he was maltreated. <br><br>Upon this point we are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the testimony of the witnesses for the Government is true, and&nbsp; that even if Boston did not&nbsp; take a material part in the act, yet he was present at the time it was done, and being in command of the persons who did it, he was responsible therefor. <br><br>The testimony of the complaining witness was sought to be impeached by the presentation of a document signed by him, in which he&nbsp; stated that the appellant had nothing to do with the commission of the offense and that he was not present when the "water cure" was administered.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the trial&nbsp; he testified&nbsp; that the&nbsp; statements contained in this declaration,&nbsp; so&nbsp; far&nbsp; as they referred&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; presence&nbsp; of Boston, were not true, and that he signed it while he was held under a charge of brigandage and through fear that he would be sent&nbsp; to Bilibid if he did not make it.&nbsp; The testimony of Boston to the effect that Garcia came to his office of&nbsp; his own motion and&nbsp; voluntarily made this statement can not be believed.&nbsp; Its sole and exclusive purpose, as appears on its face, was to relieve Boston of any responsibility for the act charged. <br><br>Among the other errors assigned by the appellant in this court is, that the&nbsp; court below erred in overruling his demurrer to the complaint, which he claims was defective because it did not&nbsp; allege that the appellant was a member of the Philippines Constabulary.&nbsp; This defect, if it existed, was cured by amendment in the court below. <br><br>It is claimed also by the appellant that a written report of the injuries received by the complaining witness, made by a&nbsp; doctor&nbsp; soon&nbsp; after the occurrence, was admitted&nbsp; in evidence without the testimony of the doctor given in open court.&nbsp; This statement is not borne out by the record.&nbsp;&nbsp; It appears therefrom that the doctor was called as a witness and testified that the matter stated in his report was true. <br><br>The evidence in&nbsp; this case showing the connection of the appellant with&nbsp; the Constabulary is practically the same as that given in the case of the United States vs.&nbsp; Prank (6 Phil.&nbsp; Rep., 433),&nbsp; and that case is authority for the ruling of the court below that&nbsp; the appellant was a member of the Constabulary. <br><br>The judgment of the court&nbsp; below is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano, C.J., Torres, Johnson</i>,&nbsp; and <i>Tracey,&nbsp; JJ</i>., concur. </div>
