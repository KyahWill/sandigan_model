				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The defendant was&nbsp; convicted&nbsp; of the&nbsp; crime of&nbsp; robbery with homicide in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Misamis and sentenced to death, there having been found present in the commission of the crime several aggravating circumstances.&nbsp;&nbsp; The case&nbsp; comes to&nbsp; us <i>en consulta.</i><br><br>The court below found clearly and conclusively proved the&nbsp; following facts, using the language of his decision:<br><br><blockquote>"On or about the 12th day of June, 1908, in Casol, barrio of Baliangao, municipality of Langaran, Province of Misamis, Rafaela Magusara, her niece Francisca Magusara, two children&nbsp; of the latter, the elder of&nbsp; whom was 11 years of age,&nbsp; named&nbsp; Hilario, Bonifacio&nbsp; Palot and&nbsp; Mateo Uraga occupied a house of light materials located in an&nbsp; isolated place. While there were three neighboring houses in&nbsp; that vicinity,&nbsp; they were so&nbsp; far away that a cry made at the house in&nbsp; question could&nbsp; not be heard at either of the others. On the day named, at about 2 o'clock&nbsp; in the morning, the accused and two&nbsp; companions, dressed&nbsp; in black, he and one companion wearing red chevrons on&nbsp; their cuffs, entered the house in question.&nbsp; They were&nbsp; all armed with daggers, bolos, and revolvers.&nbsp; The accused, who appeared to be the leader,&nbsp; called to the household in the name of the law. They awoke and lighted a lamp.&nbsp;&nbsp; The accused entered the house and&nbsp; immediately compelled Bonifacio and Mateo to go&nbsp; outside,&nbsp; striking said Bonifacio&nbsp; with a tail&nbsp; of a fish called 'ray'&nbsp; as he passed out.&nbsp; On passing out they&nbsp; were instantly seized and bound&nbsp; together by those outside and one of&nbsp; their&nbsp; captors conducted them&nbsp; to a field of hemp near by.&nbsp; The accused&nbsp; compelled Francisca Magusara and her two children&nbsp; to sit&nbsp; town in the&nbsp; house, threatening them with death if they moved.&nbsp; He and&nbsp; his companion then placed a rope around the waist of Rafaela Magusara, threw it over a rafter in the&nbsp; house, and&nbsp; seizing the end thereof, they raised and lowered her, and permitted her to violently drop to the floor several times, for the purpose of compelling her to disclose where her&nbsp; money was hidden. They then unbound her&nbsp; and&nbsp; took her with them to another part of the house&nbsp; separated from the&nbsp; others&nbsp; by&nbsp; a curtain&nbsp; of matting, where&nbsp; they&nbsp; broke open trunks&nbsp; and appropriated&nbsp; the contents, including her money.&nbsp; In the meantime Francisca and her&nbsp; children&nbsp; escaped from the house, taking different directions.&nbsp; On&nbsp; the following day they were found in the forest.&nbsp; Some moments after&nbsp; their escape Rafaela Magusara, still conducted by&nbsp; her captors, passed near&nbsp; the place&nbsp; where Bonifacio and&nbsp; Mateo&nbsp; were being detained in the&nbsp; direction of the&nbsp; seashore&nbsp; opposite the little island of Murcielagos, called also Cagban. When the accused passed near where Bonifacio and Mateo&nbsp; were detained, he called to the one who was guarding them to go&nbsp; to the house and get a bag&nbsp; of money&nbsp; which he&nbsp; had forgotten, he&nbsp; himself standing guard&nbsp; over the prisoners, who were about 10 meters distant.&nbsp; Bonifacio availed&nbsp; himself of this&nbsp; opportunity to loosen&nbsp; the rope with which he and Mateo were bound,&nbsp; telling the latter to escape.&nbsp; Mateo fled in the&nbsp; direction of a forest, while Bonifacio, being lame, was able to go only a short distance, where he hid himself&nbsp; beneath some dry hemp leaves.&nbsp; When the accused was told of the&nbsp; escape&nbsp; of&nbsp; Bonifacio and Mateo, he said that they&nbsp; ought&nbsp; to have killed them in order that they might not&nbsp; reveal&nbsp; what had been done.&nbsp; On the fourth day after,&nbsp; the&nbsp; corpse of Rafaela&nbsp; was found&nbsp; on&nbsp; the beach of Cagban with two stones tied&nbsp; to the waist, floating on the water, 1 yard deep.&nbsp; The body was substantially nude, with a strip of the skirt on the waist.&nbsp; One&nbsp; foot was gone and there&nbsp; were several&nbsp; serious wounds on&nbsp; the&nbsp; body,&nbsp; among others, one near the navel, from which protruded a portion of the intestines.&nbsp; The right arm and forearm were covered with wounds.<br></blockquote>We have carefully examined the evidence adduced at the trial and are thoroughly&nbsp; satisfied that the court below was quite correct in his conclusions as to the&nbsp; facts proved.&nbsp; The guilt of the defendant is&nbsp; proved beyond a reasonable doubt. In addition to&nbsp; the&nbsp; evidence of the persons who were in the house at the time the robbery and homicide were&nbsp; committed and&nbsp; who testify directly to the&nbsp; commission of the one and circumstantially to the other,&nbsp; the&nbsp; testimony&nbsp; of Florencia Gumiter corroborates and fortifies the case against the accused in&nbsp; a&nbsp; manner that leaves no&nbsp; room for doubt. She had been a servant in the house of the accused for some&nbsp; time&nbsp; prior&nbsp; to the&nbsp; commission of&nbsp; the&nbsp; crime.&nbsp; She testified that prior to the crime she made for the accused, at his order, the&nbsp; red sleeves which&nbsp; the other witnesses testified he wore the night of the crime; that on Thursday before the&nbsp; night of the crime he, accompanied by two other men, left&nbsp; home taking with him the said sleeves and a kris; that the other two were also armed; that on Saturday at about 3 o'clock in the afternoon two of them returned; that one of them carried some money in a handkerchief; that there were blood stains&nbsp; on some&nbsp; of their weapons and on their clothes; that the day following, the witness and the wife of the accused washed the blood out&nbsp; of the garments of the accused; that at the order of the accused, one Guillermo took the&nbsp; money thus&nbsp; brought to Misamis to change it for other money; that the&nbsp; accused, after his return,&nbsp; did&nbsp; not stay&nbsp; at&nbsp; the house, but remained in the forest in hiding, charging the witness that if anyone came looking&nbsp; for&nbsp; him she&nbsp; should say that he had returned&nbsp; to his pueblo; that some days&nbsp; after the crime the wife of the accused&nbsp; returned from Oroquieta, where she had&nbsp; been&nbsp; to attend church, and told her&nbsp; husband that they were looking for&nbsp; him; that&nbsp; thereupon the accused became very&nbsp; much frightened, and leaving the house ran to the woods; that on Tuesday&nbsp; following he and his companions&nbsp; started for the Island of Siquijor on a very rainy night.<br><br>The evidence fully justifying the conviction, and&nbsp; there being&nbsp; no error in the record&nbsp; of which the accused&nbsp; may complain, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed with costs against the appellant.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Johnson,</i> and <i>Carson, JJ.,</i> concur.<br></div>
