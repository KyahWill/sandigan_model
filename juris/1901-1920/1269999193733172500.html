				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Action for libel was begun in the Court of First Instance of the city of 
Manila against the defendant Daniel O'Connell under an information reading as 
follows:<p></p>
<p>"The undersigned accuses Daniel O'Connell of the crime of libel, committed as 
follows:</p>
<p>"That on. or about the 23d day of December, 1916, in the city of Manila, 
Philippine Islands, the said accused being then and there the editor and general 
manager of a weekly publication known as 'O'Connell's The Philippine Weekly,' 
edited and published in the city of Manila, Philippine Islands, which has a 
considerable circulation in said city and throughout the islands and foreign 
countries, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously and with 
malicious intent to injure one Florence Ann MacLeod Harper and one Donald C. 
Thompson, both war correspondents for the Leslie's Illustrated Weekly Newspaper, 
bound for Vladivostock, and with malicious intent to expose them to public 
hatred, contempt and ridicule, print and publish in the regular issue of the 
said O'Connell's The Philippine Weekly, corresponding to the 23d day of 
December, 1916, of and concerning the said Florence Ann MacLeod Harper and 
Donald C. Thompson, a certain malicious, false and defamatory libel tending to 
impeach their honesty, virtue and reputation, which said malicious, defamatory, 
false libel is as follows:</p>
<p>" 'These poor Manila dailies will swallow anything. By the Empress there 
arrived here <em>a couple of comedians</em>, a man by the name of Thompson and a 
woman by the name of Harper. <em>They claimed</em> that they are war 
correspondents bound for Vladivostock from whence they would journey to see the 
war from the Russian front. <em>The couple</em> said that they had several 
thrilling experiences and the male member of <em>the comedy team</em> told the 
reporter how he had cleverly foiled the Germans and that there was now a price 
on his head. <em>The couple said</em> that they represent Leslie's and an 
eastern newspaper syndicate. We think that they are <em>a couple of bunko 
artist</em> and their <em>tale sounds fishy</em>. For example, what are they 
doing coming to Manila from Japan if they are so anxious to get to Vladivostock? 
Why did they not leave the Empress at Japan and take one of the Jap steamers to 
Vladivostock? They travel away from Vladivostock and still claim that 
Vladivostock is where they want to go. <em>Lies, pure and simple</em>. We have 
read Leslie's for years and have never seen anything from the battle front or 
any place signed by any such pair. <em>Our idea is that they are a couple of 
affinities out for a good time.' "</em></p>
<p>The defendant was convicted of publishing a libel against the two complaining 
witnesses and sentenced by the Honorable M. V. del Rosario, judge of first 
instance, to pay a fine of P100, or to suffer subsidiary imprisonment in case of 
insolvency, and to pay the costs. Defendant appeals but makes no assignment of 
error.</p>
<p>We can deduce from the brief of counsel for appellant that he believes that 
the information is defective in that it does not contain three essential 
allegations. It is true that the information includes no colloquium and 
innuendo, but only sets out the text of the libel. But the innuendo can only be 
explanatory of the words to which it is attached. It cannot alter the sense of 
the words claimed to be libelous; it cannot enlarge or restrict the natural 
meaning of words; and it cannot render certain that which is uncertain, except 
in so far as it connects the words published with the extrinsic or explanatory 
circumstances. If the publication is not actionable <em>per se</em>, an innuendo 
cannot make it so. We have therefore to. decide the crucial question raised by 
appellant and answered by the Attorney-General, of whether or not the article 
set out in the information constitutes libel.</p>
<p>Defendant made but a faint effort to establish the truth of his statements 
relative to Mrs. Florence Ann Macleod Harper and Mr. Donald C. Thompson. On the 
contrary, the evidence for the prosecution, especially the exhibits introduced, 
shows that Mrs. Harper and Mr. Thompson are what they represented themselves to 
be, namely, duly accredited war photographers and correspondents. Mrs. Harper is 
the representative of the Sunday Pictures Section of the New York Times, 
commissioned to make photographs in the belligerent countries of Europe or Asia, 
the representative of Leslie's Illustrated Weekly Newspaper, commissioned to 
write articles for publication therein, the staff correspondent and official 
photographer of the Central News Photo Service, and the representative of the 
Paramount Pictures Corporation commissioned to take photographs. Mr. Thompson 
holds similar commissions from the same principals. Mrs. Harper has seen 
experience on the Western front in France and has been in England. Mr. Thompson 
has had experience on both fronts and has written articles and printed 
photographs in numerous periodicals. Mrs. Harper and Mr. Thompson were on their 
way to the Roumanian front and were merely passing through Manila. Both 
testified that they are married persons, that no improper relations of any kind 
existed between them, and that they were merely working together for the same 
news syndicates.</p>
<p>To establish justifiable motive, there is the testimony of the defendant who 
said that there was no desire on his part to reflect on either of the 
complainants, that the article was aimed principally at the Manila newspapers, 
and that the words found in the article claimed to be libelous were used in 
their lexical sense. Mr. O'Connell said:</p>
<p>"Your Honor, this article was aimed principally at the newspaper. The Times 
published an interview on December 21, in which Mr. Thompson and Mrs. Harper 
were quoted as saying; That Mr. Thompson was in bad in Germany and it was 
difficult for him to get in there; that he faked some story which he had 
printed, with Gimbel's or some other and on the back of it, it was no newspaper, 
simply just fixed up in a printing office, that he was captured by the Germans 
in an attempt to cross the border and he had this article in his pocket; that he 
was in for a bad time of it, going to be mistreated, thrown into jail or 
something else of the sort, in fact he was in jail when they found this paper, 
so they released him, honored him, gave him a chance to visit Von Hindenberg and 
other high officials, all that sort of thing, but word was received from some 
sort of a German spy in England who notified the German officials in Berlin that 
Thompson was a spy or something else of the sort, so they got after him and some 
German girl took pity on him and got him out of the country on a passport which 
she had for herself and brother.' That was his story. She was quoted as saying 
that she and Mr. Thompson took part in all the greatest drives and pushes of the 
European struggle in Russia and France and that they saw the Germans driven out. 
She was a real Amazon, was more gallant than Joan of Arc. That was the idea she 
attempted to convey, and, of course, it is well known here in Manila that my 
sympathies are with the Germans in this war, and when I saw this thing about 
this man 'buncombing' the whole German Government—I have had some experience as 
a war correspondent, and met some of the best of them— I knew how impossible 
this thing was; I said the story is foolish and not true, and with that idea in 
mind I wrote this article. There was no desire at all to doubt or cast any muck 
on either one of these two people or to question the woman's virtue."</p>
<p>To show that the article in question was intended as a criticism of Manila 
newspaper there is the first sentence of Mr. O'Connell's article, reading: 
"These poor Manila dailies will swallow anything." There is also in evidence for 
the defense an article in the Manila Times of December 21, 1916, entitled 
"Correspondents here tell thrilling tales of the war." In the body of the 
write-up, the phrases "teamed" and "working as a team" are found. Although the 
article in O'Connell's Weekly includes the one sentence mentioning the Manila 
dailies, and although the article may have been brought to mind by what had 
appeared in the newspapers, this cannot be pleaded as a bar to liability if the 
article does in fact libel Mrs. Harper and Mr. Thompson.</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell testifying said that he had used the word "affinity" as meaning 
"a spiritual relationship between persons of the opposite sex." He further said 
that the word "bunco" is a derivative of "buncombe" meaning "talking for effect 
or publicity or bragging."</p>
<p>The article in O'Connell's Weekly contains several expressions, italicized in 
the body of the information, which may be considered libelous. These include the 
following; "A, couple of comedians," "the comedy team," "a couple of bunko 
artists," "a couple of affinities out for a good-time," and the use of such 
language as "they claimed," "the couple said," and "still claim," all intimating 
that Mrs, .Harper and Mr. Thompson had not told the truth, and followed by the 
expression, "Lies, pure and simple." . ,</p>
<p>Defendant has imputed nothing wrong to the complainants in certain and 
express terms. But this is not necessary. Words calculated to induce suspicion 
are sometimes more effective to destroy reputation than false charges directly 
made. Ironical and metaphorical language is a favored vehicle for slander. A 
charge is sufficient if the words are calculated to induce the hearers to 
suppose and understand that the person or persons against whom they were uttered 
were guilty of certain offenses, or are sufficient to impeach their honesty, 
virtue, or reputation, or to hold the person or persons up to public ridicule. 
Said Chief Justice Shaw of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts:</p>
<p>"The rule is a sound one that the law cannot shut its eyes to what all the 
rest of the world can see; and let the slanderer disguise his language, and wrap 
up his meaning in ambiguous givings out, as he will, and it shall not avail him, 
because courts will understand language, in whatever form it is used, as all 
mankind understands it." (Carter <em>vs</em>. Andrews [1834], 16 Pick. (Mass.], 
1.)</p>
<p>Said another court much more recently:</p>
<p>"The test of libelous meanings is not the analysis of a sentence into 
component phrases with the meticulous care of the grammarian or stylist, but the 
import conveyed by the entirety of the language to the ordinary reader." (Miller 
<em>vs</em>. O'Connell, City Ct, 57 L. J., 1768, Sept. 12, 1917.)</p>
<p>The questions then are—What meaning would a reader of O'Connell's Weekly 
attach to the article describing Mrs. Harper and Mr. Thompson? Are the different 
phrases taken together and the style and tone of the article such as to 
constitute a libel?</p>
<p>We believe that the answers to these questions by the average reader would be 
that Mr. O'Connell intended to charge Mrs. Harper and Mr. Thompson with having 
told falsehoods, intended to ridicule them as war correspondents by terming them 
"comedians" and "bunko artists," and finally intended the public to think of 
them as travelling together under circumstances which were highly immoral. From 
beginning to end the article ridicules the complainants and their statements and 
casts reflections upon their veracity and morality. The statements charging 
immorality or conveying the impression that the complainants are prevaricators 
are libelous <em>per se</em>. It is further a general rule that a newspaper 
which holds one up to scorn and ridicule and to feelings of contempt or 
execration impairs such a person in the enjoyment of general society. It sets a 
person before his fellowmen in a scurrilous and ignominious light. Such written 
abuse affects his general fortune and comfort and is thus a positive injury. 
Especially is it to be condemned when the author directly or through veiled 
words speaks of a married woman as the paramour of a man not her husband. Under 
all the circumstances and in an effort to understand the language of the article 
in question in its plain and popular sense—to read the sentences as would the 
man on the street—we can reach no other conclusion than that from this article 
it would be commonly understood and believed that Mrs. Harper and Mr. Thompson 
instead of being reputable war correspondents were falsifiers living in an 
illicit manner.</p>
<p>To summarize, the matter charged as libelous has not been proved to be true. 
Good motives, such as an endeavor to serve or protect the public, are not 
apparent. Justifiable motives have not been shown. Under our Libel Law, malice 
must, therefore, be presumed. The article in question is a malicious defamation 
tending to impeach the honesty, virtue, and reputation of two strangers within 
our gates, and does thereby expose respectable persons to public contempt and 
ridicule. This is libel.</p>
<p>Judgment of the lower court is modified by sentencing the defendant and 
appellant to pay a fine of five hundred pesos, or to suffer subsidiary 
imprisonment in case of insolvency, with the costs of both instances against the 
appellant. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Carson, Araullo, Street</em>, and <em>Avanceña, 
JJ.</em>, concur.</p></div>
