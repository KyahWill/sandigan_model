				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This was an action brought in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Ilocos Norte for the partition of a certain parcel of land described in the second paragraph of the complaint, which action was commenced on the 1st day of August, 1905.<br><br>The plaintiffs allege that they and the defendant are the heirs of Calixto Ruguian and that the said land constituted a part of the estate of Calixto&nbsp; Ruguian, who had&nbsp; died some six months prior to the 1st day of August, 1905.<br><br>To the petition of the plaintiffs, the defendant filed a general&nbsp; denial,&nbsp; together with a&nbsp; special defense, in which he alleged that he was the owner of the said land and had been in&nbsp; the uninterrupted possession of&nbsp; the same for a period of about forty years.<br><br>After hearing the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause, the lower court ordered a partition of the property in accordance with the prayer of the petition&nbsp; of&nbsp; the plaintiffs.&nbsp;&nbsp; From this&nbsp; decision&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant appealed and made the following assignments of error:<br><blockquote>"1. The court&nbsp; erred in allowing the action brought by the plaintiffs.<br><br>"2. The court erred in finding that the property in question is a part of the estate of the deceased Calixto Ruguian.<br><br>"3. The court erred in considering the plaintiff's claim as proven, and riot the allegation on which the defendant bases his argument."</blockquote>From the record it appears that the said Diego,&nbsp; Felipa, and Valeriana Ruguian, plaintiffs, and the said&nbsp; Roman Ruguian were brothers and sisters, and that Faustina and Antonio were children of two other deceased brothers, all of which brothers were the children of one Calixto Ruguian.<br><br>The plaintiffs&nbsp; claim that the land in question was&nbsp; a part of the estate of their deceased father, Calixto Ruguian. The defendant claims that his father had deeded the land to him nearly forty years before the latters death.&nbsp; The defendant presents no document to sustain his contention. There is a preponderance of evidence, however, showing that the defendant had been in possession of the land for a period of about thirty years.&nbsp; The evidence also shows that if the land was deeded at all to the defendant, it must have been deeded by Calixto Ruguian and Mariano Ruguian, Mariano being a brother of Calixto.&nbsp; There being no documentary evidence, however, to support the contention of the defendant that the land in question had been deeded to him, we are unable to find as a fact that the said land had actually been conveyed to him, and it appearing from the evidence that a third person, Mariano Ruguian, had an interest in the land in question, and he not being made a party to&nbsp; this suit, we are of the opinion, and so hold, for this reason, that a partition of the land in question can not be granted.&nbsp; This court has&nbsp; already held, in the case of Garcia de Lara <i>vs.</i> Gonzalez de Lara (2 Phil. Rep., 294), that an action will not lie for the&nbsp; partition of an undivided interest in land without the joinder of all coowners.<br><br>Therefore, for the reason that the&nbsp; evidence shows that all of the parties interested in the land in question are not parties to the suit, the decision of the lower court is hereby reversed,&nbsp; and, without&nbsp; any finding&nbsp; as to costs, it&nbsp; is so ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Carson,&nbsp; Willard, </i> and <i>Tracey, JJ.,</i> concur. </div>
