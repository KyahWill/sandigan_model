				<BR><STRONG>MORELAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Cagayan 
Province convicting the accused of the crime of estafa and sentencing him to one 
year one month and eleven days of imprisonment, to pay the costs, and to 
indemnify Fernando Molina Martell in the sum of P130, with subsidiary 
imprisonment in case same is not paid.
<p>It is the undisputed evidence that on the 19th of April, 1913, the accused 
was an employee of Fernando Molina Martell and that, on said date, he was 
dispatched by his employer to Tuguegarao to get P130 from the manager of the 
Tabacalera Company at that place; that the money was delivered to the accused by 
the Tabacalera Company to be handed to Fernando Molina Martell; that the accused 
never delivered the money to Martell.</p>
<p>The witness Julian Domingo testified in behalf of the prosecution that the 
defendant stated to him on the 27th of April, "I brought money, but I lost it in 
the game," and "I have to wait until the head of Senor Molina gets cold."</p>
<p>Feliciano Villaflor, a Constabulary soldier, a witness in behalf of the 
prosecution, testified that on April 20,1913, he saw the defendant in the 
cockpit of Tuguegarao and that the defendant bet and lost P30 on cockfights.</p>
<p>The accused admitted that he had received the money with the obligation to 
deliver it to Martell and that he did riot deliver it, giving as his reason 
therefor that on April 19 he tied the money, which was all in silver, in a bag 
and fastened it behind him on the saddle of his horse. From thence it was lost 
on the journey. He denied that he lost the money in gambling but claimed that it 
disappeared together with a bundle of his clothing while he was riding his horse 
as aforesaid.</p>
<p>Appellant's counsel states in his brief:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The whole case hinges upon the question whether the story told by the 
witness who says he saw the accused in the cockpit on April 20, and of the 
witness who says the accused stated he lost the money 'in the game,' shall be 
believed, or whether the story of the defendant is accepted."</p></blockquote>
<p>The trial court, in its decision upon which the judgment of conviction is 
based, states that the defendant's "explanation of the loss of the money is not 
credible and that his acts in connection with the loss of same as alleged by him 
were inconsistent with the theory of innocence." The trial court had all of the 
witnesses before it and was, therefore, in some ways, in a better position to 
judge the relative value of their declarations than are we, who see merely the 
typewritten questions and answers. There is nothing in the record which would 
intimate, much less demonstrate, that the court failed to take into 
consideration some material fact or circumstance, or did not weigh accurately 
the evidence presented, or failed to perform some duty to the accused laid upon 
him by the law.</p>
<p>While we are of the opinion that the judgment of conviction is well founded, 
it is our judgment that the court erred in imposing the maximum penalty. Abuse 
of confidence, which the learned trial court used as an aggravating circumstance 
in order to impose the maximum penalty, is one of the essential elements of the 
crime charged and, therefore, cannot be used as an aggravating circumstance. The 
medium degree of the penalty should have been imposed. </p>
<p>The judgment of conviction is affirmed, it being understood that the criminal 
penalty imposed is four months and one day of <em>arresto mayor</em>. As so 
modified, the judgment is affirmed, with costs against the appellant.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson, Carson,</em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.,</em> 
concur.<br></p></div>
