				<H3>RUDOLPH WAHL, JR., AND DR. KURT WAHL, PARTNERS IN THE BUSINESS FIRM OF RUDOLPH WAHL & CO., PLAINTIFFS AND APPELLANTS, VS. DONALDSON, SIMS & CO., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>COOPER, .:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is an action brought by Rudolph Wahl  &amp; Co. vs. Donaldson, Sims &amp;  Co., based upon a contract  by which the plaintiffs leased to the defendants a certain ship called <em>Petrarch </em>for the term of six months, under which contract the plaintiffs  claimed that  the defendants were  indebted to them a balance of $25,484.38, with interest from the 30th day of July, 1901.</p>
<p>Suit was instituted on the. 4th day of March, 1902, and service of citation was  had upon  the  defendants  on the same day.</p>
<p>The defendants failed to answer the  complaint, and on the ISth day of April,  1902, judgment was rendered by default  against, the defendants in  favor of the plaintiffs for the sum of $17,892.81.</p>
<p>Afterwards, on the 10th day of June, 1902, the defendants made an application  to the Court of First Instance for a  new trial, under section  11.3 of  the Code of Civil Procedure, 1901.   This motion for a new trial was granted by the Court  of First  Instance,  and  the judgment by default against the defendants was set aside on the 20th day of June, 1902.</p>
<p>After the granting of  the motion for a  new trial a demurrer  was  made by the  defendants  to  the complaint which  presented the question  of the competency  of the Court  of First  Instance to try the case.   The objection was based upon  the grounds that  there was a provision contained in the contract to the following effect:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"If there should,arise any difference of opinion between the parties to this contract, whether it may be with reference to the principal matter or in any detail, this difference shall be referred  for arbitration to two competent persons in Hongkong, one of which shall be  selected by each of the contracting parties, with  the  power to call in a  third party in the event of a disagreement; the majority of the opinions will be final and obligatory to the end of compelling any payment.  This award may be made a rule of the court,"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The question presented for our determination is whether a provision of this character is invalid as being against public  policy.   Agreements to refer  matters in  dispute to arbitration have  been regarded  generally as attempts to oust the juridiction of the court, and  are not enforced. The rule is thus stated in Clark on Contracts, page 432:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"A condition in a contract that disputes arising out of it shall be referred to arbitration is good  where the amount of damages sustained by a breach of the contract is to be ascertained by specified arbitration before any right of action arises, but that  it is illegal where  all the matters in dispute of whatever  sort may be referred to arbitrators and to them alone.   In  the first case a condition precedent to the accrual of a right of action is imposed, while in the second it is attempted  to prevent any right of action accruing at all, and this can not be permitted."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems to  be the  general rule in the United States, and we understand that in the civil  law it is also the rule that, where there is a stipulation that all matters in  dispute are to be  referred to arbitrators and  to them alone, such stipulation is contrary to public policy.</p>
<p>We reach the conclusion that the Court of First Instance should have entertained jurisdiction in this case, notwithstanding the clause providing for arbitration above referred to.</p>
<p>With regard  to the sufficiency of the motion to set aside the  judgment by default and  the order  of the court in granting the same, the  majority of  this court are of  the opinion that there was no error in the action of the court. In this the writer does not concur.</p>
<p>The application of the defendants, upon which the judgment was set aside, appears to be defective and not sufficient to have justified  the setting aside of the judgment by default.</p>
<p>There was no excuse whatever shown why the defendants failed to answer  within the time prescribed by law.   The citation was served  upon the defendants on the 4th day of March, and the judgment by default was not taken until the 18th day of April, 1902.</p>
<p>The application was based upon section 113 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1901, which reads as follows :</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Upon such terms as  .may be just the court may relieve a party or his legal representative from a judgment, order, or other proceeding taken against him through his mistake, inadvertence, surprise,  or excusable  neglect:  Provided, That application therefor  be made  within a  reasonable time, but in no case exceeding six months after such judgment, order, or proceeding was taken."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems to be a literal copy of section 473 of the Civil Code of Procedure of California, and, according to the well-known rule of construction, the decisions of the court  of  California,  made  prior to  the.adoption of the statute here, should have the same weight that such  decisions would have in California.</p>
<p>Under  the construction by the supreme court  of  California of the section in  question, it is stated  that the application should show  merits, and that this should he done with some degree of certainty and not left to surmise.</p>
<p>In the case of Taylor <em>vs</em>. Randall  (5 Cal., 80) an affidavit had Itwm made to  the effect that an instrument had been  materially altered without showing  in any manner in what the alteration consisted.   It was held that this furnished no grounds on which to base a motion to set aside the judgment.</p>
<p>It is said in the case of Bailey vs.  Tatte  (20 Cal., 422) that the better practice is to prepare and exhibit to the court the defendant's answer at the hearing of the motion. It is also held  in the case of Reidy <em>vs</em>.  Scott (53  Cal., 73) that where the affidavit shows that  the defense rests upon matters which would be deemed to  be waived except for the interposition of a  demurrer, the  defense is merely of a technical character and the affidavit is insufficient.</p>
<p>The affidavit in this case states in a general way  that the defendants have a counterclaim against the plaintiffs for |125,000, based upon the failure on the  .part of the plaintiffs  to perform the contract with  regard to  the <em>Petrarch</em>.   This statement is too vague  and uncertain to show merits in the defense.</p>
<p>After the application to  set aside the judgment had been granted, instead of presenting this defense, a  demurrer is presented  to the petition, based upon  the purely technical grounds that under the contract the parties had agreed to settle the  matters in dispute by arbitration at Hongkong. If the  answer had been prepared by  the defendants  and presented  to the Court of First Instance at  the time of the granting of the order, the Court of First Instance must have concluded that the defense was based upon  a technicality and the  application must have been overruled. But, as stated before, this view is not concurred in by the majority of the court.</p>
<p>The  judgment of the court in sustaining the demurrer to  the  complaint and in  holding  that the Court of First Instance did not have jurisdiction on account of the clause with reference to arbitration,  was erroneous, and  it will be  set aside and a new trial had.  The costs of this  appeal is adjudged against the appellees, the defendants.  It is so ordered and adjudged.</p>
<p><em> Torres</em> and <em>Mapa JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em> Arellano, C. J.,</em> and McDonougal, J., did not sit  in this case.</p>
<p><em> Willard, J.,</em> concurring, with whom concurs <em>Ladd, J</em>.:</p>
<p>I agree with the result.<br>
