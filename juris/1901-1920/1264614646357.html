				G.R. No. 1098, April 06, 1903</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE, VS. LICERIO MENDOZA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>That the deceased, Rufino Dizon, was creating a disturbance in  front of the store of Alejandro Guevara, and that the defendant,  a policeman, attempted to arrest him and take him to the presidencia and that he declined to go, was clearly proved.   We think that it was also proved that the deceased did not content himself with a passive resistance, but carried  it  to the extent of attacking the defendant. The defendant himself so testifies, and his testimony is corroborated by that of said Alejandro Guevara.   The latter says that he intervened hot ween the two men in order to separate Ihem and  that the defendant's revolver was discharged almost in his face.  If the resistance of Dizon had heen passive, Guevara would hardly have intervened,  for fear that he himself  might he arrested for interfering with an officer in the performance of his duty.  His intervention can he explained  only on the theory that the deceased was making  an attack on the defendant.   We accordingly hold that the proof shows an unlawful aggression on the part of the former.  It. was also shown that there  was no provocation  moving from the defendant.</p>
<p>The complete defense of article 8, No. 4,  of the Penal Code,  is, however, not made out because the second requirement, thereof was not proved.  When the defendant fired his revolver and killed Dizon the latter, according to the defendant's own  testimony, had  already struck  twice at him with a <em>calicut</em>.   The character of this weapon is such that in our opinion the defendant could not then have reasonably  helieved that it was necessary to kill  his assailant in order to repel the  attack.</p>
<p>The incomplete defense is, however, made out, and, applying article 86  of  the Penal  Code, we revoke  the judgment of the court helow in respect jo the penalty and fix the same at  six years  and one day of <em>prision mayor</em>.   In other respects  the judgment, so far as it is not inconsistent with this opinion, is hereby confirmed, with costs of this instance <em>de oficio</em>.</p>
<p><em> Arellano, C.J., Torres,  Cooper, Mapa,</em> and Ladd, JJ., concur.</p>
