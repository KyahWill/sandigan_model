				G.R. No. 1195, February 20, 1903</h4>
				<H3>TRANQUILINA ALMADIN, PETITIONER, VS. CELESTINO ALMADIN, RESPONDENT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>COOPER, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> This is an application  to  set aside  a judgment of the Court of First Instance  of Laguna rendered on the 1st day of October, 1902.  It is made under section 513 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1901, relating to procedure in cases of defaults caused by fraud, accident, or mistake.</p>
<p> The application shows  that on the 6th  day of October the defendant made a motion  in the  Court of  First Instance for a new trial, supported by affidavit which presented excuse for his  failure to attend on  the day fixed for the trial of the case, the day on which  the judgment was rendered.</p>
<p> This motion was filed in this court on the 2d day of February, 1903.</p>
<p> The section under which  the application is  made requires that the petition to the Supreme Court shall be made "within sixty days after the complainant first learns of the rendition of such judgment and not thereafter."</p>
<p> It will be  unnecessary  to consider  the case presented on  its merits, as it  clearly appears that  the application has not been made within sixty days after the defendant first was informed of the rendition of the judgment against him.</p>
<p> It is stated in  the application that  on the 31st day of January following, after the adjournment of the term of court at  which  the  judgment  was rendered, the Court of First Instance entered  an order overruling the motion for  a  new trial.</p>
<p> The petitioner  contends that the sixty days  should be calculated from the date of the rendition of  the judgment of the Court of First Instance overruling his motion for a new trial, but the language of the statute is  explicit upon this point.</p>
<p> The knowledge of  the defendant of the rendition of the judgment by default must be attributed to him as of the date on which he filed his motion for a new trial in the Court of First Instance, to  wit, the 6th day of October, 1902, and the sixty days for the filing of  the application consequently expired on the  6th day of December, 1902.</p>
<p> The application to set aside the judgment comes too late, and  the  same must be overruled, which  is accordingly done, with costs of proceedings against, the petitioner.</p>
<p> <em> Arellano,  C.J., Torres, Willard, Mapa,</em> and <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
