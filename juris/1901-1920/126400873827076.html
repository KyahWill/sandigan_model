				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Sometime during the latter half of the year 1901, Alfredo Jeanjaquet opened an account with the Iloilo branch of the Compañia General de Tabacos de Filipinas.  From that time until  about July, 1906, he received at various times money, machinery, and other supplies.  During this  same period he made various payments on his account by turning over to the company's agent  sugar  and other farm  products. On the termination of the business relations between that company and Jeanjaquet, it was found that he was indebted to the said company in the sum of over P55,000.   The company, in the month of August, 1906, instituted an action in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Occidental Negros, in which judgment was asked for the  balance due. Subsequently thereto and on the 1st  of September, 1906, the plaintiff in that action  obtained  an  attachment and placed the same in the hands of the sheriff for execution. The sheriff,  through his deputy, in compliance  with  the order of the court, wherein he was  directed to attach and hold sufficient  of the defendant's property to  cover  the amount of over P55,000 alleged to be due the plaintiff company, proceeded to attach various articles of personal property and six  parcels of land, which he, the sheriff,  was informed belonged to the defendant in that case.  Immediately after the attachment of this property the plaintiff in the case at bar, Arcadia Reynes, filed a protest with the deputy sheriff, claiming to be the exclusive  owner of practically  all of  the property thus attached,  and asked the said deputy sheriff to  dissolve  the attachment.  On the deputy sheriff's refusing to grant her request, she instituted this action, making the sheriff, the deputy sheriff, and the Compañia General de Tabacos de Filipinas party defendants, and asked the court to declare  that all the property specified in her  protest belonged to her,  and for the dissolution of the attachment in reference to this property.  The sheriff and his deputy having failed to appear and  answer the complaint, judgment by default was entered against them. The defendant company filed  its first answer to  this  complaint on January 19, 1907, in  which it confined itself to denying all of the allegations  in the complaint.  Subsequently thereto and on the 4th of February of  the same year,  the company filed  an  amended  answer. In  this amended  answer the company again denied all the allegations  in the complaint,  and alleged in its cross-complaint that the contract of purchase and sale made  on the  23d of September,  1903, wherein  it appears that the plaintiff purchased a one-half undivided  interest  in the hacienda Providencia from Manuela Daniel, was simulated, the true purchaser being Alfredo Jeanjaquet, and that the said Jeanjaquet entered  into that simulated contract for the purpose of disposing of his property in  order to defraud his creditor, the defendant  company.  The defendant  company prayed the court to include the  said Jeanjaquet in this suit as one of the  defendants; that  said contract of purchase and  sale be declared null and void; and  that the plaintiff be required to pay the costs.  On the 5th  of August of the same year, the defendant  company  filed another amended answer.   In this last amended answer, it  admitted the  allegations set forth in paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 of the complaint, and denied those in paragraphs 4,  5, 6, and  7.  As a special defense, defendant alleged  that  all the property described in the complaint belonged exclusively to Alfredo Jeanjaquet, who was then  indebted to it in the sum of over ^55,000,  and asked the court to absolve it from the complaint and declare that all of said property belonged to the said Jeanjaquet.</p>
<p>After a full consideration  of the proofs presented, the trial court rendered judgment declaring Alfredo Jeanjaquet' to be the owner of a one-half interest in the hacienda Providencia, two  houses, one stable,  and several articles of personal property,  and the plaintiff to be the owner of the other five parcels of land, all of the carabao and cattle, and one sewing machine.  From  this  judgment, both  parties appealed and  presented  separate bills of exceptions.</p>
<p>We think the findings of the trial court, wherein it held that those specified articles of  personal property attached (except the horses, which have since died  and for which counsel for the plaintiff now make no claim) belonged to Alfredo Jeanjaquet, is fully  supported by  the evidence of record.   A discussion upon the ownership of these articles of personal property is unnecessary.</p>
<p>It will be noted that the defendant company, in its second amended answer, alleged fraud  on  the part of the plaintiff and Alfredo Jeanjaquet, but that in  its final amended answer it specifically eliminated this  question.  No allegation of fraud is alleged  in this final  answer, nor are there any allegations from  which  fraud  may be inferred.  Unquestionably, the company had a right to set up fraud on the part of the plaintiff  and Alfredo  Jeanjaquet as a  special defense.   It is nevertheless just as true that it had a perfect right to  eliminate  this  question and rely solely upon  the ownership.  Where pleadings are amended,  the prior pleadings are to be regarded as abandoned.   (39 Cent. Dig. Pleading,  sec. 737|, and cases thereunder.)</p>
<p>An amended complaint  and  the answer thereto, when filed, take  the  place of the originals,  which then cease to perform  any further function as  pleadings.  (People  <em>vs.</em> Hunt, 1 Idaho, 433.)</p>
<p>Where issue  is joined  on an. amended petition, the original answer not being made a part of the second answer, the  case stands for trial on the amended pleadings only. (First National Bank vs. Western Union Telegraph Company, 30 Ohio, 555.)   In this case the telegraph company set up a special contract as a defense against a claim for damages.   In the amended answer no reference was made to this special contract.  The court said:</p>
<blockquote><p>"In this state of the pleadings, we look to the amended petition and  answer  alone.   Thus, the special  contract is eliminated from the case."</p></blockquote>
<p>Where an amended answer is complete  in itself, it supersedes the  original answer, which no longer remains a part of the record.   (Kuhland vs. Sedgwick, 17 CaL, 123;  White vs. Hampton, 9 Iowa,  181; Olesen vs. Newell, 12 Minn., 186; Wells vs. Applegate,  12 Ore.,  208.)</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to decide in  this case what would have been the result of the question with reference to the pleadings if the defendant company  had presented evidence establishing fraud on the part of the plaintiff and Alfredo Jeanjaquet, and had  that evidence been  admitted without objection on the part of the plaintiff.  The only question to be determined is, who was the owner of the remainder of the property in dispute at  the  time the attachment was executed?</p>
<p>The principal contention between the parties has been in reference to the ownership of the one-half  undivided interest in the hacienda Providencia.  In Exhibit No. 1, which is a  notarial  document  executed on  September 23, 1903, by Manuela Daniel in favor of the  plaintiff, it clearly and specifically appears  that this one-half undivided interest in that  hacienda is the property of  the plaintiff.  It is admitted that Daniel was  the owner of this one-half of  the hacienda, and when she executed this public document, she stated that the sale was made to the plaintiff.  Exhibit 3 is  a  contract executed by Manuela Daniel in favor of the plaintiff on the 18th of August, 1904, extending the time for the payment of the balance due on this  one-half interest in the hacienda.   In 1906 Manuela Daniel brought an action in the Court of First Instance of Occidental Negros against this plaintiff to  recover  the balance of the purchase price due on that hacienda and  obtained judgment against this plaintiff for F514.44, together with interest and costs.  This judgment was  satisfied  by the plaintiff, according to the receipt of the clerk of the court.  In the certified  copy of the decision of the court  in that case of Manuela Daniel vs. Arcadia  Reynes, it is established  that the plaintiff in the case at  bar made certain  payments on  that land: on the 29th of September, 1903, she paid P500; in March, 1904, P31.40; in September, 1904, P19.75; and on  November 10, 1904, P636.50.   All of these  partial payments, according to the documentary evidence, were paid by the plaintiff and receipted for by the seller  or  her agent.  Notwithstanding this documentary evidence,  part of which appears in a notarial document, and part in  a solemn judgment of the court, Manuela Daniel testified that this one-half  undivided  interest in  the hacienda Providencia was not sold to the plaintiff but to Alfredo Jeanjaquet.  Such testimony on the part of the seller does not deserve serious consideration, in view of the fact that she herself has stated,  over her own signature,  on various  occasions, that the purchaser  was the plaintiff.  Furthermore,  she  admits, in these  documents, that she  received the money from the  plaintiff; and again, she brought an action against the  plaintiff and did recover from her the balance due on the purchase  price.  After having made all of  these transactions in this manner, it is too late for Manuela Daniel to say, some three  years later, that these documents do not state the truth.</p>
<p>But it is insisted that  Alfredo Jeanjaquet  furnished the plaintiff the money with which this one-half interest in that hacienda was purchased.   Alfredo Jeanjaquet testified that he  has no interest  whatever  in this hacienda.  If he did furnish the money for its purchase (this fact is not proved), the result would be the same,  as he had a right to loan the plaintiff  money or make her a present of it.  The ownership of the two houses and the stable necessarily followed the  ownership of  the one-half undivided interest  in  the hacienda.</p>
<p>We  think the  trial court,  in considering the  testimony with reference to the ownership of the one-half  undivided interest  in  this  hacienda,  failed  to give due  weight and credit  to the documentary evidence presented by  the plaintiff,  especially the  notarial document  of purchase and sale and  the judgment of the court wherein the seller sought to and  did recover the balance of the purchase price from this plaintiff.</p>
<p>The findings of fact of  the trial court with reference to the other five parcels of land and  the carabao and cattle are fully supported by the evidence.</p>
<p>The judgment  appealed from should be and  the same is hereby modified by excluding from the real property declared to be  that of Alfredo Jeanjaquet  at  the  time  the attachment was executed, the one-half interest in the hacienda, the two houses, and the stable.   This one-half undivided interest in the hacienda, and the  buildings, are hereby  declared to be the  property of the plaintiff.  As thus modified, the judgment is affirmed, without costs.</p>
