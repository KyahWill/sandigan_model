				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On the 4th day of December,&nbsp; 1905, the said Sy Joe Lieng, Sy Joe Chay, Sy Jui Niu and Sy Chua Niu filed an amended complaint against the said defendants, alleging: That in or about the year&nbsp; 1823 one&nbsp; Sy Quia, subsequently known in these Islands as Vicente Romero&nbsp; Sy Quia,&nbsp; was&nbsp; born in China,&nbsp; and&nbsp; in or about the year&nbsp; 1847 was married in the city of Amoy to Yap Puan Niu, of which marriage&nbsp; the following male children were born, to wit: Sy By Bo and Sy By Guit, they being the only legitimate heirs of the said&nbsp; Vicente Romero Sy&nbsp; Quia; that in or about the year 1882 Sy&nbsp; By Bo died intestate in China,&nbsp; leaving as his only surviving children and legitimate heirs the plaintiffs Sy Yoc&nbsp; Chay and Sy Jui&nbsp; Niu; that in or about the year 1880 the&nbsp; other child of Sy&nbsp; Quia, Sy By Guit, also died intestate in China, leaving as his only surviving children and legitimate heirs the other plaintiffs, Sy Joe Lieng and Sy Chua Niu; that in or about&nbsp; the&nbsp; year 1891 Yap&nbsp; Puan&nbsp; Niu died&nbsp; intestate in China,&nbsp; leaving her surviving husband, Sy Quia, and her grandchildren, who are the plaintiffs in&nbsp; this case;&nbsp; that in the year 1894 Vicente Romero Sy Quia died intestate in this city of Manila, leaving his&nbsp; surviving grandchildren, the plaintiffs, as his only legitimate heirs.<br><br>That&nbsp; Vicente&nbsp; Romero Sy Quia&nbsp; acquired during his life-time a large amount of property, consisting of personal and real property in the Philippine Islands,&nbsp; mostly located in the city of&nbsp; Manila, amounting to P1,000,000 Philippine currency; that on or about&nbsp; the&nbsp; 3d of August, 1900, the defendants illegally, without any rights, and in&nbsp; the absence of the plaintiffs&nbsp; herein, took&nbsp; possession of&nbsp; all the said personal and real property left by the said Sy Quia, deceased, and since then have managed and&nbsp; administered the same, alleging to be the owners thereof; that since the said&nbsp; 3d day of August, 1900, the defendants&nbsp; and each of them have converted and are converting part&nbsp; of the property of the said Sy&nbsp; Quia, deceased,&nbsp; to the use and benefit of each of them,&nbsp; and a&nbsp; large&nbsp; part&nbsp; of&nbsp; the said property, consisting of real and personal property&nbsp; unknown to the plaintiffs, they being in possession thereof as owners, exercising over them acts of ownership, and&nbsp; converting them to their own use; that it has been impossible for the plaintiffs&nbsp; to discover, ascertain, and have knowledge&nbsp; of&nbsp; each and all the items of real and personal property belonging to the said Vicente Romero Sy&nbsp; Quia, deceased, at the time of his death, nor the amount of personal and real property converted by the defendants, except such as is&nbsp; described in the accompanying document marked "Exhibit A," which is a&nbsp; part of&nbsp; the complaint; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; property&nbsp; described&nbsp; in said document is a part of the&nbsp; estate left by the deceased Sy Quia at the&nbsp; time of his death,&nbsp; aside&nbsp; and&nbsp; apart from the personal and real property converted by the defendants, who are, and each one of them is, in possession&nbsp; and custody of all the&nbsp; deeds, instruments, contracts, books, and&nbsp; papers relating to the title&nbsp; and&nbsp; conversion&nbsp; of&nbsp; the said real and personal property, which titles and the descriptions thereof could not be proven&nbsp; without&nbsp; the sworn statements of the defendants and&nbsp; of each one&nbsp; of them; that the plaintiffs are informed and believe that the said real and&nbsp; personal property belonging to the estate of the said Sy Quia, and which is now held and controlled by the defendants, has a value of approximately P1,000,000, Philippine&nbsp; currency.<br><br>That the plaintiffs are&nbsp; the only descendants and legitimate&nbsp; heirs of the deceased Sy Quia, they being entitled to the possession of all the property of&nbsp; his estate, as well as of the real and personal&nbsp; property converted as aforesaid, and&nbsp; the defendants&nbsp; having appropriated&nbsp; the&nbsp; same, with all the rents and profits&nbsp; thereof, it&nbsp; is impossible for the plaintiffs to ascertain and discover the true amount of the said rents and profits, which aggregate&nbsp; several thousand pesos, all of&nbsp; which&nbsp; said property is in&nbsp; danger of&nbsp; being lost, to the irreparable damage of the plaintiffs, unless and except a&nbsp; receiver is appointed to take charge of the preservation&nbsp; and&nbsp; custody of the&nbsp; same in order to protect&nbsp; the interests&nbsp; of the said plaintiffs, and enable the court&nbsp; to determine the actual value of the&nbsp; real and personal&nbsp; property of the estate at the time of the death of&nbsp; the said Sy Quia, as well as the value of the real and personal property subsequently&nbsp; converted by the defendants, together with the rents and profits of the whole&nbsp; estate,&nbsp; converted by the defendants to their own use and&nbsp; benefit; wherefore it is necessary that said defendants be&nbsp; required to render&nbsp; detailed accounts of the real and personal property and rents and profits of the estate, and that it&nbsp; be ascertained by the sworn statement of the said defendants what the actual value of the real and personal property of the&nbsp; said estate, with&nbsp; the rents and&nbsp; profits,&nbsp; thus&nbsp; converted and&nbsp; held&nbsp; by them, is.<br><br>They accordingly prayed that defendants be directed to render under&nbsp; oath a complete and&nbsp; detailed account of all the property left by&nbsp; Sy Quia at the time of his death, of the administration, custody,&nbsp; control, conversion and disposal thereof,&nbsp; of the conversion of&nbsp; the same,&nbsp; and of the rents and profits&nbsp; of&nbsp; the original property, as well as of the property thus&nbsp; converted, including in the said accounting both such properties with the&nbsp; rents and profits; that, upon the&nbsp; giving of the necessary bond, a receiver be appointed to administer the original property, as&nbsp; well as the property&nbsp; converted, during the pendency of the present litigation,&nbsp; the&nbsp; said complete&nbsp; and&nbsp; detailed account&nbsp; under oath as aforesaid to be submitted&nbsp; to the court, covering the original property as&nbsp; well as the property converted, with all rents and profits, and that thereupon a receiver be appointed to take charge and control&nbsp; of the administration of the whole of said property.<br><br>They further prayed that it be adjudged and decreed that the defendants are the only descendants and heirs of the said Vicente Romero Sy Quia from and since the time of his death, and&nbsp; that&nbsp; they are the only legitimate&nbsp; owners&nbsp; of the real and&nbsp; personal&nbsp; property&nbsp; left by him,&nbsp; and&nbsp; of&nbsp; the whole of said property converted by&nbsp; the defendants, and that they are entitled to the possession of the whole of the said property and the rents and profits accruing therefrom; that it be decreed that the defendants have not and never had any right, title or interest to the said property, nor to the rents and&nbsp; profits&nbsp; thereof, the same being held by them as mere trustees for&nbsp; the benefit of the plaintiffs and each of them, further praying&nbsp; for any other relief which&nbsp; the court may deem just and equitable, and for the costs of this action.<br><center><br>ANSWER.<br></center><br>The defendants, Petronila Encarnacion, Pedro Sy Quia, and Juan Sy Quia, answering the foregoing complaint, specifically deny paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 of the complaint, which relate to the paternity and status of&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiffs, and to the death of their grandmother and parents, and also deny&nbsp; generally all and each of the allegations contained in paragraphs&nbsp; 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,&nbsp; 13, 14, 15, and 16&nbsp; of the complaint, relating to the succession and actual condition of the estate of&nbsp; the deceased Sy Quia, except as&nbsp; otherwise expressly admitted as true in the said answer,<br><br>As a special defense and in opposition to the complaint, the defendants allege that prior to the year 1852 Vicente Ruperto&nbsp; Romero Sy&nbsp; Quia&nbsp; was an&nbsp; infidel known only by the name of Sy&nbsp; Quia, he having&nbsp; resided in the Philippine Islands for&nbsp; many years prior thereto; that on June&nbsp; 8, and made an integral part of the answer; that on June 9, 1853, the Christian Chinaman Vicente Ruperto Romero Sy Quia contracted canonical marriage in accordance with the laws then&nbsp; in force&nbsp; in&nbsp; these Islands, with the defendant Petronila Encarnacion, a native of Vigan, Ilocos Sur,&nbsp; as shown by his certificate of marriage marked "Exhibit 2," which is made an integral part of the answer;&nbsp; that the said Vicente Sy Quia and his wife, Petronila Encarnacion, fixed their residence and conjugal domicile in these Islands until the dissolution of the conjugal partnership by the death&nbsp; of the husband&nbsp; on January 9,&nbsp; 1894;&nbsp; that at the time of&nbsp; their marriage&nbsp; Vicente&nbsp; Romero Sy Quia had no property, and brought no property into the marriage, but that the&nbsp; wife brought to the marriage a small capital which was the&nbsp; foundation of the subsequent fortune&nbsp; acquired by the spouses by their labor and industry, and by the labor and industry of the children, five in number, named Apolinaria, Maria, Gregorio, Pedro and Juan, all of whom have always been in&nbsp; continuous possession of the status of legitimate children, in lawful wedlock begotten of the said Vicente Romero&nbsp; Sy&nbsp; Quia and Petronila Encarnacion, according&nbsp; to the copies of the certificates of baptism marked "Exhibits 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7," to be considered as an integral part of the answer.<br><br>That on&nbsp; January 9, 1894, Vicente Romero Sy Quia died intestate in the city of Manila, and after the necessary legal proceedings under the&nbsp; legislation then&nbsp; in force,&nbsp; his&nbsp; surviving children, Apolinaria, Gregorio, Pedro and Juan, and his&nbsp; grandchild Generoso Mendoza, representing his mother, Maria Romero Sy Quia, deceased,&nbsp; were declared by a decree of the Court of First Instance of the district of Quiapo, dated January 26 of the said year, to be the heirs abintestate of the said deceased, as shown by a copy of the said decree, marked "Exhibit 3,"&nbsp; as&nbsp; an integral&nbsp; part of the answer, Apolinaria Romero Sy Quia, one of the&nbsp; children recognized as heirs of their deceased father, having died on the 1st of May, 1900, leaving as&nbsp; her&nbsp; only legitimate heir her surviving mother, Petronila Encarnacion.<br><br>That since&nbsp; January 9,&nbsp; 1894,&nbsp; when&nbsp; Vicente&nbsp; Romero&nbsp; Sy Quia&nbsp; died, the defendants&nbsp; have been&nbsp; in&nbsp; quiet, peaceful, and uninterrupted possession as owners in good faith and with&nbsp; a just&nbsp; title, of the property which constitutes the estate of&nbsp; their deceased&nbsp; father, they never having been heretofore disturbed&nbsp; therein by the&nbsp; plaintiffs&nbsp; or&nbsp; any&nbsp; of them,&nbsp; notwithstanding the fact that the&nbsp; said plaintiffs were&nbsp; here in the Philippine Islands, and&nbsp; all the property included in the inventory made at the time of the partition of the estate&nbsp; of the&nbsp; deceased Sy&nbsp; Quia, was acquired&nbsp; by him subsequent to&nbsp; the year 1853, when&nbsp; he married the defendant Petronila Encarnacion;&nbsp; that a great portion&nbsp; of the real property included in the&nbsp; said inventory was acquired by Petronila Encarnacion&nbsp; after the&nbsp; death&nbsp; of her husband, and that in the title deeds of a considerable portion of the property&nbsp; bought&nbsp; during&nbsp; the&nbsp; lifetime&nbsp; of Sy Quia,&nbsp; Petronila Encarnacion appears as the vendee,&nbsp; wherefore the defendants Pedro&nbsp; Sy&nbsp; Quia,&nbsp; Juan Sy&nbsp; Quia, arid Petronila Encarnacion prayed the court that they&nbsp; be acquitted of the complaint, with the costs against the plaintiffs, and that they, the defendants, be granted&nbsp; such&nbsp; other and further relief as might be&nbsp; just and equitable.<br><br>The other defendant, Gregorio Sy Quia, answering the complaint, denied all&nbsp; and each&nbsp; of the allegations&nbsp; therein contained,&nbsp; and further specifically denied that Sy Quia had married in or about the year 1847 at&nbsp; Amoy,&nbsp; China, the Chinese woman Yap Puan Niu, and that the said Sy Bi Bo and Sy&nbsp; By Guit were the legitimate&nbsp; children and heirs of the deceased Sy&nbsp; Quia,&nbsp; also that the plaintiffs Sy Joe Lieng, Sy&nbsp; Joe Chay, Sy Jui Niu and Sy&nbsp; Chua&nbsp; Niu were the grandchildren and legitimate heirs of the deceased Vicente Romero Sy Quia; that as a&nbsp; special defense he alleged that the deceased Sy Quia,&nbsp; many years prior to 1852, while a non-Christian Chinese subject, definitely fixed his&nbsp; residence&nbsp; and domicile in the Philippine&nbsp; Islands,&nbsp; subjecting himself to the laws then therein in force; that in the year 1852 Sy Quia was baptized, having been converted to the Catholic faith, on the 11th of June of that year, the ceremony taking place at the parish church&nbsp; of San Vicente, he being then named Vicente Ruperto Romero Sy Quia, and on June 9 of&nbsp; the following year he contracted marriage with Petronila Encarhacion in accordance with the rites of the Catholic Church,&nbsp; and in conformity with the laws then in force in the Philippine&nbsp; Islands, as shown by the church certificates marked "Exhibits A and B."<br><br>That Sy Quia and&nbsp; his wife Petronila&nbsp; Encarnacion since their marriage continuously resided&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Philippine Islands until the 9th of January, 1894,&nbsp; when the husband died intestate,&nbsp; they having had since their marriage five children, among them Gregorio, who subscribes this&nbsp; answer, according&nbsp; to canonical certificate Exhibit C; that&nbsp; the deceased Sy Quia brought no property into the conjugal partnership, but Petronila Encamacion did bring with&nbsp; her the small capital of P5,000, with which, through their labor and industry at first, and subsequently by the labor and industry of their children,&nbsp; they had acquired the large&nbsp; amount of property existing at the time of the death of the husband, said property so acquired being located in the Philippine Islands; that on&nbsp; the 23d&nbsp; of January,&nbsp; 1894, by an order of the Court of First Instance of the district of&nbsp; Quiapo, the surviving children of Sy Quia, named Apolinaria, Gregorio, Pedro, and Juan, and Sy Quia's grandchild, Generoso Mendoza, representing his&nbsp; (Generoso's) deceased mother, Maria Romero Sy Quia,&nbsp; were&nbsp; declared to be the&nbsp; heirs abintestate of the said Sy Quia, as&nbsp; shown by a copy of the said decree, marked "Exhibit D," the&nbsp; defendants having taken possession&nbsp; from that date of the property&nbsp; left by the deceased Sy Quia, they having continued so in possession in the quality&nbsp; of owners, with just&nbsp; title and&nbsp; good faith, adversely, publicly, quietly and peacefully, until the plaintiffs presented their complaint to the&nbsp; court; that on the 1st day of May, 1900, Apolinaria Romero Sy Quia died a spinster and intestate, leaving as her only legitimate heir her mother, Petronila Encarnacion; that the plaintiffs at the time of the death of Vicente Romero Sy Quia had knowledge of his demise, and had notice that the defendants had petitioned to the court for a declaration, which they obtained, to the effect that they were&nbsp; the heirs of the said Vicente Romero Sy&nbsp; Quia, deceased; and that at no time were the plaintiffs or their parents recognized or considered by the said Vicente Ruperto Romero Sy&nbsp; Quia as his descendants, heirs or relatives; wherefore defendant&nbsp; prayed&nbsp; that judgment be entered declaring that the&nbsp; plaintiffs had no right or interest to or in the estate of the deceased Vicente Romero Sy Quia, and that&nbsp; the defendants are the only legitimate heirs of the said Sy Quia,&nbsp; taxing the&nbsp; costs against the plaintiffs.<br><br>The last of the defendants, Generoso Mendoza Sy Quia, answering the complaint on the&nbsp; 18th of January, 1906, alleged that he denied all and each of the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 to 16, inclusive, of the&nbsp; complaint, and. that he also specifically denied that the deceased&nbsp; Sy Quia, whose Christian&nbsp; name is Vicente Ruperto Romero Sy&nbsp; Quia, had married&nbsp; at&nbsp; Amoy,&nbsp; China, the&nbsp; woman Yap Puan Niu, in or about the year 1847, or at any time previous or subsequent thereto; that the said Sy By Bo and Sy By Guit were the legitimate children and heirs of the deceased Sy&nbsp; Quia; that the plaintiffs&nbsp; Sy Joe Lieng, Sy Yoc&nbsp; Chay, Sy Jui Niu,&nbsp; and Sy Chua Niu were the legitimate descendants or heirs of the deceased&nbsp; Sy Quia.<br><br>As a special defense, defendant alleged that the Chinaman Sy Quia came to the Philippine Islands as an&nbsp; immigrant a long time prior&nbsp; to 1852, fixing his residence and domicile therein, and subjecting himself to the laws then in force in this country; that in the said year 1852, Sy&nbsp; Quia having been converted to Christianity,&nbsp; was baptized An the parish church&nbsp; of San&nbsp; Vicente, Ilocos&nbsp; Sur,&nbsp; and&nbsp; named&nbsp; Vicente Ruperto Romero Sy Quia, as shown by the canonical certificates exhibited by the&nbsp; defendants, and&nbsp; marked "Exhibits 1 and A," which are&nbsp; made a part&nbsp; of this answer; that on June 9, Vicente Ruperto Romero Sy Quia&nbsp; was married by the&nbsp; Church to Petronila&nbsp; Encarnacion in accordance with the canonical laws, as&nbsp; shown by&nbsp; the certified copies of the marriage certificate, marked "Exhibits 2 and B," introduced by the other defendants; that Sy Quia and his wife Petronila Encarnacion established themselves&nbsp; and fixed their conjugal domicile in the Philippine Islands,&nbsp; where they continued to reside until the&nbsp; 9th of January,&nbsp; 1894,&nbsp; when the marriage was dissolved by the death of the husband in Manila;&nbsp; that&nbsp; the said&nbsp; spouses&nbsp; since&nbsp; their marriage had five&nbsp; children,&nbsp; of&nbsp; whom Apolinaria died&nbsp; a&nbsp; spinster, and Maria, who had married, died leaving a child, the defendant Generoso Mendoza, the grandson of the&nbsp; deceased Sy Quia, the said Generoso Mendoza and&nbsp; the other children&nbsp; of the deceased Sy Quia, named Gregorio, Pedro, and Juan, having survived; that Vicente Romero Sy Quia&nbsp; at the time of his marriage owned no property,&nbsp; while Petronila Encarnacion brought to the conjugal partnership a small capital, amounting to P5,000, which was the foundation of the large fortune subsequently acquired by them through their labor and industry, subsequently augmented with the aid of their own children.<br><br>That&nbsp; on&nbsp; the 9th of&nbsp; January,&nbsp; 1894,&nbsp; Vicente Romero Sy Quia died, and&nbsp; after the necessary legal&nbsp; proceedings under the law of civil procedure then in force in these Islands, the Court&nbsp; of First Instance by&nbsp; a decree dated the 26th of the said month and year,&nbsp; declared that the surviving children, Apolinaria, Gregorio, Pedro, and Juan,&nbsp; and his grandchild&nbsp; Generoso Mendoza, representing his mother Maria, deceased, were the heirs of the deceased Sy Quia, intestate, as&nbsp; shown&nbsp; by Exhibits 8 and D,&nbsp; introduced by the other defendants; that&nbsp; on May 1,&nbsp; 1900, the oldest daughter, Apolinaria, died&nbsp; intestate and single,&nbsp; leaving as her only heir her mother&nbsp; Petronila Encarnacion; that since the death of the said Vicente Romero Sy Quia the defendants had been in quiet, public, peaceful, and uninterrupted possession of the property left by the deceased Sy Quia, having held the same&nbsp; adversely, with good faith and just&nbsp; title; and that they have never been disturbed by the plaintiffs in such possession, notwithstanding the fact that they, the plaintiffs, were in the Philippine&nbsp; Islands at the time of the death of Vicente Romero Sy Quia, and had knowledge of the fact that the defendants had&nbsp; applied to the Court of&nbsp; First Instance&nbsp; for and secured&nbsp; a&nbsp; declaration to&nbsp; the effect that they were&nbsp; the heirs of the deceased Sy Quia; and that neither the plaintiffs&nbsp; nor&nbsp; the said Sy By Bo and Sy&nbsp; By Guit had ever been recognized or considered by the deceased Vicente Romero Sy Quia as his descendants, heirs or relatives, they never having been in possession of the legal status&nbsp; of children or legitimate descendants of&nbsp; the said Sy Quia; wherefore this defendant&nbsp; prayed that judgment be rendered in favor of all the defendants, acquitting them of the complaint, and directing that the plaintiffs pay the costs.<br><center><br>AMENDMENT TO THE COMPLAINT.<br></center><br>The plaintiffs&nbsp; on the 31st of January, 1906, presented by way of&nbsp; reply to the answers of the various defendants an amendment to the original complaint, denying generally and specifically all and each of the&nbsp; material allegations set out in the answers of the defendants&nbsp; and alleging that the pretended marriage between Vicente Romero Sy Quia and Petronila Encarnacion was not a lawful marriage,&nbsp; but a false and fraudulent one, without&nbsp; any&nbsp; force,&nbsp; efficacy, or legal validity, the certificate of marriage presented by the defendants not&nbsp; being a true and correct certificate of marriage, the same being false, fraudulent, and without any force, efficacy,&nbsp; or legal validity, for the reason that on June 9, 1853, Vicente Romero&nbsp; Sy Quia was and thereafter continued to be the lawful husband of one Yap Puan Niu, until the year 1891, when she&nbsp; died, and that the marriage of Sy Quia&nbsp; with the said Yap Puan&nbsp; Niu, since 1847&nbsp; and until her death&nbsp; in 1891, was continuously in full force and effect, Sy Quia&nbsp; not having married again after the&nbsp; death of the said wife; and that Apolinaria,&nbsp; Maria, Gregorio, Pedro and Juan, the alleged legitimate children of Vicente Romero Sy Quia and Petronila Encarnacion, were not and never had been&nbsp; the&nbsp; legitimate children&nbsp; of Sy Quia, and that they were not and never had been his legitimate heirs and descendants, the certificates&nbsp; of baptism produced by the defendants, and marked&nbsp; "Exhibits 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7," not being true nor proper, but false and fraudulent, and of no force, efficacy, or legal validity, the said children not being the legitimate descendants of the deceased&nbsp; Sy, Quia. Paragraphs 9 and 10 of the amended complaint are a repetition of similar paragraphs contained in the original.<br><center><br>ANSWER TO THE AMENDED COMPLAINT.<br></center><br>The defendants, Generoso Mendoza,&nbsp; Petronila Encarnacion, Pedro Sy Quia, Gregorio Sy Quia, and Juan&nbsp; Sy Quia, filed their&nbsp; answers to the amended complaint on&nbsp; the 7th and&nbsp; 13th of February, 1906,&nbsp; denying all and each of the allegations contained in paragraphs 2, 3, 4, and&nbsp; 5 of the amended complaint,&nbsp; stating that they ratified each and all of the allegations, denials&nbsp; and defenses contained in their previous answer, which they&nbsp; reproduced&nbsp; therein, and that they renewed their prayer that judgment be rendered acquitting them&nbsp; of the said complaint, with the costs&nbsp; against the plaintiffs.<br><br>On June&nbsp; 19,&nbsp; 1906, counsel for Petronila&nbsp; Encarnacion notified the court in writing of the death of&nbsp; the said Petronila&nbsp; Encarnacion, who died in this city on&nbsp; the&nbsp; 6th of the said month, and as counsel for the other defendants, £edro and&nbsp; Juan Sy Quia,&nbsp; moved the court that&nbsp; in accordance with section&nbsp; 119&nbsp; of the Code&nbsp; of Civil Procedure, an order be made directing that&nbsp; the action&nbsp; be&nbsp; proceeded with in the name of the administrator of her estate, Pedro Sy Quia, which&nbsp; motion was granted without any&nbsp; objection on the part of the plaintiffs' attorney, on June 21, 1906.<br><br>On August 20, 1906, it&nbsp; was stipulated between&nbsp; counsel for both parties that by order of the court the deposition of several witnesses then designated by the plaintiffs be taken at Amoy, China,&nbsp; before the consul,&nbsp; vice-consul, or a consular agent&nbsp; of the United&nbsp; States in the&nbsp; said city, during the days&nbsp; and in the manner agreed upon,&nbsp; in accordance with&nbsp; section 362 of the Code of Civil&nbsp; Procedure,&nbsp; the defendants&nbsp; being&nbsp; authorized to take the deposition&nbsp; of&nbsp; such witnesses as they might desire to present in the&nbsp; manner agreed upon.<br><br>On November 8, 1906, counsel for plaintiffs informed the court of the death of one of the plaintiffs, Sy Jui&nbsp; Niu, at Amoy, China, on or about the 28th of July of the said year, and she having died intestate, the court on November 8, appointed C.&nbsp; W. O'Brien as special&nbsp; administrator of&nbsp; her estate, and said counsel thereupon asked the&nbsp; court to allow the action to be continued&nbsp; by him, and, by a subsequent petition filed on the&nbsp; 13th of the same month, the administrator C. W. O'Brien, appointed as aforesaid,&nbsp; filed a written appearance as such&nbsp; administrator of the estate of the deceased Sy Jui Niu.<br><br>On a petition filed&nbsp; on the 17th of November, 1906, counsel for both&nbsp; parties informed&nbsp; the&nbsp; court that the documents presented by the defendants, and marked "Exhibits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,&nbsp; and 7, and A, B, and C," which are&nbsp; certificates of baptism, marriage, and burial, should&nbsp; be considered as original and authentic documents, so as to avoid the necessity of presenting the originals themselves, which were&nbsp; bound in book form, together&nbsp; with&nbsp; other documents&nbsp; relating to&nbsp; persons who had no connection with this litigation.<br><br>On the 4th of January, 1907, the defendants presented a motion to the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First Instance, asking that the&nbsp; depositions taken&nbsp; before the consul&nbsp; of&nbsp; the United&nbsp; States at Amoy, China, as given&nbsp; by the witnesses for&nbsp; the plaintiffs, named Li Ung Bing, Sy Peng, Lim Chio, Yap Si Tan, Yap Chia, Sy Kay&nbsp; Tit, Yap Chong, Sy Boan, Sy Kong Len, and Sy Hong Oan, whose testimony the plaintiffs attempted to introduce in this action, be not admitted, defendants' motion being based on the ground&nbsp; that the&nbsp; said depositions contained a formal defect concerning the manner in which the oath was administered to the witnesses.<br><br>In a petition filed on the same date, January 4, the defendants&nbsp; reproduced their former&nbsp; motion,&nbsp; alleging as a further ground in&nbsp; support thereof that the&nbsp; certificates by the&nbsp; officer who&nbsp; took the said depositions did not comply with the essential requisites provided by law, and after due notice to the plaintiffs, a&nbsp; hearing was had&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the said petition on January 7, 1907.&nbsp; After the recital of the evidence introduced by both parties, and after the documents exhibited by them, together&nbsp; with the depositions&nbsp; taken at Vigan of various witnesses for the defendants, and of the depositions taken at Amoy, China, had been united to the record, the Court of First Instance on the 26th of February, 1908, rendered a judgment declaring that the plaintiffs Sy Joe Lieng, Sy Yoc Chay, Sy Chua Niu, and C.&nbsp; W.&nbsp; O'Brien, the&nbsp; latter as guardian of Sian&nbsp; Han, and the defendants Gregorio&nbsp; Sy&nbsp; Quia,&nbsp; Pedro Sy Quia, Juan Sy&nbsp; Quia, and Generoso Mendoza Sy Quia, and the heirs of the deceased Petronila Encarnacion, represented by&nbsp; one of the defendants, Pedro Sy Quia, as the administrator of the property, were the heirs&nbsp; of&nbsp; the property of the estate of Vicente Romero Sy Quia, now deceased, consisting of one-half of the&nbsp; property distributed by the order of the Court of'First&nbsp; Instance of the district of Quiapo&nbsp; of the 3d of August,&nbsp; 1900, in the following form: To&nbsp; Sy Joe Lieng, one-ninth; Sy Yoc Chay, one-ninth;&nbsp; Sy Chua Niu, one-ninth; C. W.&nbsp; O'Brien, as the guardian&nbsp; of Sian Han, one-ninth; Pedro&nbsp; Sy&nbsp; Quia, one-ninth; Juan Sy Quia, one-ninth; Gregorio Sy Quia, one-ninth ; Generoso Mendoza Sy Quia, one-ninth; and the heirs of Petronila&nbsp; Encarnacion,&nbsp; represented by&nbsp; Pedro&nbsp; Sy Quia as the administrator of the latter's&nbsp; estate,&nbsp; one-ninth; the heirs of&nbsp; the&nbsp; said Petronila&nbsp; Encarnacion,&nbsp; represented&nbsp; by the administrator of her estate, being the owners&nbsp; with the right to possession of the&nbsp; other half of the property left by Vicente Romero Sy Quia at the time of his death.<br><br>That the defendants, Gregorio, Pedro, Juan, and Generoso, and Pedro Sy Quia as the administrator of the&nbsp; property of his mother Petronila Encarnacion and as a representative of the&nbsp; latter's heirs,&nbsp; render a statement of the property which was distributed among them under and by virtue of the order of the Court of First Instance, of the 3d of August, 1900.<br><br>That the said defendants and each of them render an accounting of the rents and profits of all the property respectively received by them&nbsp; from the dates&nbsp; when they&nbsp; were delivered to them, it being understood that if upon making the inventory of the property it appears that the portion thereof assigned to Petronila Encarnacion as her share does not exceed one-half of all the property left by Vicente Romero Sy Quia, at the time of his&nbsp; death, it will not be necessary&nbsp; to&nbsp; render an accounting of the rents anol profits of the portion to her thus assigned.<br><br>That a receiver, to&nbsp; be selected later, be appointed&nbsp; upon the giving of a sufficient bond,&nbsp; the amount of which will be hereafter fixed, to take charge and possession of all the property known as aforesaid, it being understood that if upon&nbsp; making a list of the said property it appears that the part thereof assigned to Petronila Encarnacion as her share does&nbsp; not exceed one-half of&nbsp; all the property of the estate of Vicente Romero Sy Quia&nbsp; at the time of his death, the said receiver shall only take possession&nbsp; of one-half of the property assigned to the other persons who have accounted for them.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Court of First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; made no special order as to costs.<br><br>To&nbsp; this decision of&nbsp; the trial court counsel&nbsp; for the defendants, Pedro Sy Quia,&nbsp; by himself&nbsp; and as administrator of the estate of Petronila Encarnacion, Juan Sy Quia, Gregorio Sy Quia, and Generoso Mendoza, duly excepted, and by a&nbsp; motion presented to the court&nbsp; asked that&nbsp; the&nbsp; said judgment be set aside and&nbsp; a new&nbsp; trial&nbsp; granted, on the ground&nbsp; that the evidence was&nbsp; insufficient to justify the decision in favor of the plaintiffs, and because the decision of the trial court was contrary to law, the findings of fact being plainly&nbsp; and manifestly against the weight of the evidence.&nbsp; Upon notice to counsel for&nbsp; plaintiffs, a hearing was had upon said motions, which were subsequently over-ruled by the court.&nbsp; Defendants having duly excepted to the order of the court overruling the same,&nbsp; and upon filing their bill of&nbsp; exceptions, asked the court to unite&nbsp; to the&nbsp; same all&nbsp; of the evidence taken and introduced by both parties, with the&nbsp; documents and pleadings presented during the course of the trial, the transcript of the stenographic&nbsp; notes containing the testimony of the witnesses, and the depositions taken&nbsp; at Vigan and Amoy, which said bill of exceptions defendants asked the court to approve and certify to the Supreme Court, with all of the said evidence which was made an integral part thereof.<br><br>By an order entered on the 28th of March, 1908, the court upon&nbsp; certifying the bill&nbsp; of exceptions,&nbsp; directed that the execution&nbsp; of the&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; be&nbsp; not stayed in&nbsp; so far&nbsp; as&nbsp; it required the defendants to submit a statement showing the property received&nbsp; by them, and to render an account of all the rents&nbsp; and profits,&nbsp; upon giving a bond satisfactory to the court,&nbsp; to secure the fulfillment of the judgment in&nbsp; case the same&nbsp; be totally or partially affirmed by the Supreme Court.<br><br>The trial&nbsp; court&nbsp; in deciding the motion for&nbsp; the appointment of a&nbsp; receiver, and after hearing both parties, made an order on the 17th&nbsp; of March, 1908, appointing Gregorio Sy Quia as receiver&nbsp; of the property in&nbsp; question, upon the giving of a bond in the sum&nbsp; of P400,000, to be approved by the court, and in case that&nbsp; the&nbsp; person thus appointed did not accept,&nbsp; the appointment&nbsp; would be set aside, and&nbsp; a stranger duly qualified substituted.&nbsp; To this order of the court the defendants Pedro Sy Quia and Juan Sy Quia duly excepted, and on the 27th of March, 1908, there was united to the proper files&nbsp; the personal bond for P400,000 given by the receiver.<br><br>By another order made on the said 17th day of March, the court in deciding&nbsp; the motion that&nbsp; a time be&nbsp; fixed within which the defendants should report to the court whatever property belonging to the deceased Vicente Romero Sy Quia was distributed among them, directed that the defendants Juan Sy Quia, Generoso Mendoza and Pedro Sy Quia, the latter by himself and&nbsp; as administrator of the&nbsp; estate of Petronila Encarnacion,&nbsp; submit a&nbsp; statement of the property distributed among them under and by virtue of the order of the 3d of August, 190D, on or before the&nbsp; 23d day&nbsp; of March, 1908, and that Gregorio Sy Quia submit a similar&nbsp; statement on or before the 31st day of the&nbsp; said month and&nbsp; year.<br><br>Pedro Sy Quia and Juan Sy Quia excepted to this order of the court dated March&nbsp; 17 as&nbsp; aforesaid, requiring them to submit a statement of the property they had received, and asked the court to approve and to have united t<y additional="" one="" presented="" them,="" notwithstanding="" objection="" counsel="" for ="" plaintiffs,="" by="" an="" dated="" april="" 4, ="" 1908,="" certified="" supplementary="" exceptions;="" considering="" appointment="" of ="" gregorio="" sy="" quia="" receiver="" made="" suggestion="" open ="" court, ="" at="" which="" time="" amount="" bond="" fixed="" knowledge="" defendants,="" also="" directing="" a ="" statement="" property="" received="" by ="" the ="" defendants="" submitted="" within="" a="" specified ="" time, ="" ordered="" that="" execution="" judgment ="" be="" not="" stayed="" so="" far ="" as="" latter ="" order="" concerned,="" original="" bill="" exceptions,="" together ="" sup ="" plementary ="" one, ="" was="" duly="" forwarded="" to="" clerk ="" of="" this="" court="" in="" connection="" with="" the="" appeal="" taken="" and="" allowed.=""><br><br>The plaintiffs, upon being notified of the said judgment of the court, excepted thereto, and requested in writing that the court modify its decision and&nbsp; conclusions of law by declaring&nbsp; that the plaintiffs Sy Joe Lieng, Sy Yoc Ohay, Sy Chua Niu, and G. W. O'Brien, as the guardian of Sian Han,&nbsp; were&nbsp; the&nbsp; only heirs&nbsp; of&nbsp; Vicente&nbsp; Romero&nbsp; Sy Quia, deceased;&nbsp; that they were entitled to all the property left by the latter, and distributed under the order of the court of the 3d of August, 1900;&nbsp; that Petronila&nbsp; Encarnacion, deceased, and her children and heirs had no interest in the said estate of Sy Quia; that they were not the heirs of the deceased&nbsp; Vicente Romero Sy Quia; that the receiver appointed&nbsp; by&nbsp; the court be authorized to take possession of all the property left by the said deceased, especially the property which was distributed by the decree of the court of the&nbsp; 3d&nbsp; of&nbsp; August, 1900, together with the rents and profits, and that the said judgment be modified, awarding the plaintiffs&nbsp; the costs&nbsp; of the&nbsp; action, and directing that defendants submit an accounting of the property in litigation.<br><br>This&nbsp; action&nbsp; has for its purpose primarily to recover from the present possessors the property left at&nbsp; the time of his death in this&nbsp; city by the Christian Chinaman, Vicente Romero Sy Quia, the&nbsp; plaintiffs alleging that three of them are the grandchildren and one&nbsp; the great-grandson&nbsp; of the deceased Sy Quia by his lawful marriage in his own country with their&nbsp; deceased grandmother, Yap Puan Nzu.&nbsp; So that the marriage of the said&nbsp; Sy Quia with this woman in China is practically&nbsp; the fundamental basis of the&nbsp; action brought by the plaintiffs for the recovery of the inheritance against the defendants, who appear to&nbsp; be the&nbsp; children&nbsp; of the deceased Sy&nbsp; Quia by his marriage in these Islands with the native, Petronila Encarnacion.<br><br>Does&nbsp; the record&nbsp; show that the Chinaman&nbsp; Sy Quia removed from Vigan,&nbsp; Philippine Islands, to his native town or village&nbsp; of&nbsp; Am Thau, Amoy,&nbsp; China, in&nbsp; 1847, and then married in accordance with the rites and ceremonies of his native country, Yap Puan Niu?<br><br>Plaintiffs having failed to present at the trial&nbsp; the matrimonial letters&nbsp; which should have been exchanged between the contracting parties at the time the said marriage was performed, according to the ancient laws and customs of the Celestial Kingdom, and there being no allegation&nbsp; in the complaint as to the day and month of the common calendar year, or of the Chinese calendar year,&nbsp; when the said marriage took&nbsp; place, there is no ground on which to base the conclusion that such an&nbsp; important act&nbsp; in the life&nbsp; of Sy Quia has been duly established by authentic documents, nor is his alleged voyage to China&nbsp; from the port of Manila for the purpose of contracting such marriage, satisfactorily proven thereby, for the plaintiffs&nbsp; have&nbsp; likewise failed to introduce in evidence the passport, required by the legislation then in force, which should and would have been then issued to Sy&nbsp; Quia in order to&nbsp; enable him to leave&nbsp; this country and&nbsp; return to his own.&nbsp;&nbsp; (See superior decree of December 20,1849.)<br><br>Seven witnesses, named Sy Peng, Lim&nbsp; Chio, Yap Si Tan, Yap Chia, Sy Kai Tit, Yap Chong, and Sy Botm, whose respective ages are not less than 71 nor more than 80 years, in their testimony or depositions before&nbsp; the vice-consul of the United States at Amoy, having&nbsp; promised to tell the truth, affirmed through an interpreter that they were present at the ceremony of the wedding&nbsp; of the said Sy Quia with the Chinese woman Yap Puan Niu; that&nbsp; Sy Quia, who was in these Islands, having&nbsp; been expressly called&nbsp; to China by his father for the&nbsp; purpose of marrying the said Yap Puan Niu, accordingly returned to his native town&nbsp; or village of Am Thau, and, after being&nbsp; married to Yap Puan Niu, remained&nbsp; in the said village three of four years with his wife, by whom he had two children, Sy By Bo and Sy By Guit, the latter having been bom one year after the birth of the former.<br><br>To overcome the testimony pi the witnesses for the plaintiffs, the defendants presented nine witnesses, to wit: Felix Millan, Aniceto Singson, Norberta Feril,&nbsp; Remigio Tongson, Estefania Crisologo, Alexandra Singson, Benita Encarnacion, Paulino Revilla, and Silveria&nbsp; Damian, whose respective ages were not less than 71 nor&nbsp; more than 87 years, except Aniceto Singson, who was only 66 years of age, who testified, some of them in the Court of First Instance of Manila, and the others before the justice of the peace of Vigan by virtue of a commission, that they knew&nbsp; Sy Quia when he was an unmarried resident of the city of Vigan, for six or seven years according to most of the said witnesses, and for five years according to others, prior to his marriage with Petronila Encarnacion, they having known him when he was a clerk and dry goods salesman for another&nbsp; Chinaman by the name of Jose Gloria Lecaroz, a resident of Manila, the witness Revilla stating that he was gobernadorcillo in 1852, when Sy Quia, after being converted to the&nbsp; Christian religion,&nbsp; was baptized in&nbsp; the&nbsp; church of San&nbsp; Vicente, the priest of which, who was his (Revilla's)&nbsp; uncle, being frequently&nbsp; visited&nbsp; by the said Sy Quia for the purpose of the Iatter's instruction in the new religion,&nbsp; and that Sy Quia&nbsp; upon being baptized was named Vicente Ruperto Romero, after his godfather Romero, who was at&nbsp; that time the clerk of the court; and Silveria Damian further testified that to the best of her recollection Sy Quia arrived in Vigan in the year 1848, stopping at her&nbsp; house,&nbsp; Sy Quia being a friend and countryman&nbsp; of her&nbsp; husband, who was&nbsp; also a Chinaman, and&nbsp; that she&nbsp; knew&nbsp; that Sy Quia was then a bachelor, that he was baptized&nbsp; some&nbsp; years later,&nbsp; and on the following year&nbsp; was married to Petronila&nbsp; Encarnacion. Silveria&nbsp; Damian, her husband and&nbsp; other witnesses&nbsp; in the case attended the wedding.<br><br>It will be seen therefore that the record contains&nbsp; strikingly conflicting evidence, that&nbsp; is to say,&nbsp; the evidence introduced by the plaintiffs is directly in conflict with that adduced by the defendants for while the witnesses for the&nbsp; plaintiffs asserted that Sy Quia was at Am Thau, Amoy, in&nbsp; 1847, and contracted marriage in that year with Yap Puan Niu, with whom be continued to live for&nbsp; about three or four years thereafter, during which&nbsp; time the&nbsp; children&nbsp; Sy By Bo and Sy By Guit were born; the witnesses for the defendants on the other hand affirmed that&nbsp; Sy Quia was at the time in Vigan, and that he did not leave&nbsp; that city during the six or seven&nbsp; years,&nbsp; according to&nbsp; most of the&nbsp; witnesses,&nbsp; and during tfre five years, according to the others, which immediately preceded his marriage with Petronila Encarnacion in 1853.<br><br>In order to determine whether the weight and preponderance of the evidence is with the plaintiffs or in favor of the defendants, in accordance with the provisions of section 273 of the&nbsp; Code of Civil Procedure, it becomes necessary to examine&nbsp; and analyze each of the&nbsp; declarations of the respective witnesses presented at the trial, and ascertain the result of their various declarations taken as a whole, bearing in mind the circumstances of the case, the probability or improbability of their&nbsp; testimony, with due regard to the nature of the facts as to which they testified, their degree of intelligence, and the manner in which they testified.<br><br>The presence of Sy Quia&nbsp; in Vigan, and his presence at the same time at Am Thau, Province of Amoy,&nbsp; China, for a period of four years, to wit, from 1847 to 1850, two facts which are directly inconsistent with each other, might have been&nbsp; satisfactorily established&nbsp; by the&nbsp; testimony of witnesses, but the only proof of the fact of the marriage alleged to have&nbsp; been contracted&nbsp; by Sy&nbsp; Quia at the said Chinese town in&nbsp; 1847 could only have consisted of the matrimonial letters or cards which should have been exchanged between the families&nbsp; of the two contracting parties&nbsp; in the manner referred to by&nbsp; the witness&nbsp; Li Ung&nbsp; Bing, the&nbsp; interpreter of the American Consulate, who was called by the plaintiffs themselves, and whose testimony in this respect is uniformly corroborated by Nicolay&nbsp; in his book entitled "<i>Historia de las Creencias,"</i>&nbsp; by Ratzel in his&nbsp; book entitled "<i>Las Razas Humanas,</i>" by Cantu in&nbsp; his work entitled&nbsp; <i>"Historia&nbsp; Universal,</i>" and by the authors of the "Spanish American Encyclopedic Dictionary."&nbsp; These matrimonial letters, once&nbsp; they have been mutually exchanged by the contracting parties, constitute the essential requisite&nbsp; required by the laws of that country&nbsp; in order that a Chinese marriage may be considered duly&nbsp; solemnized, and at the same time are the best proof of&nbsp; its having actually taken place.<br><br>The party obliged&nbsp; to&nbsp; exhibit these letters can only be relieved from the necessity of so doing by proving that the same&nbsp; have been lost or&nbsp; disappeared, for in the absence of such proof&nbsp; (there being none of this character in&nbsp; the record), they must be produced&nbsp; at the trial&nbsp; in&nbsp; order to establish the fact of the marriage&nbsp; alleged to have taken place, and&nbsp; only in the cases expressly excepted by law&nbsp; can any&nbsp; other&nbsp; proof,&nbsp; such&nbsp; as the testimony of witnesses,&nbsp; be allowed, but the letters themselves must&nbsp; be produced as evidence of the contract to which they relate, in accordance with the provisions of section 285 of the&nbsp; Code of Civil Procedure.<br><br>The failure to produce the said matrimonial letters which, according to some of the&nbsp; witnesses for the plaintiffs, were exchanged&nbsp; between both&nbsp; families prior to the celebration of the&nbsp; marriage of Sy&nbsp; Quia with Yap Puan Niu, and&nbsp; the lack of proof that they had been destroyed or lost,&nbsp; give rise to the&nbsp; legal presumption&nbsp; that the marriage was&nbsp; not performed; and such&nbsp; presumption can not be overcome by&nbsp; the testimony of witnesses, some of them incompetent, while the testimony of others is conflicting, not to say contradictory, in itself, as well as&nbsp; highly improbable; for&nbsp; this is a most important contract,&nbsp; which, according to&nbsp; the ancient laws and customs of China, must be evidenced by&nbsp; such&nbsp; letters or cards, and&nbsp; the fact that these letters&nbsp; have&nbsp; not been produced shows that the marriage never took place; if they actually exist they should be exhibited, for it is a well-known rule that where evidence&nbsp; is wilfully suppressed, it is presumed that it would be&nbsp; adverse to the party presenting&nbsp; the same, if produced.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Sec. 334, par.&nbsp; 5, Code of Civil Procedure.)<br><br>Entering upon an analysis of the testimony&nbsp; of&nbsp; the witnesses&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiffs,&nbsp; it will be&nbsp; noticed that Sy Peng stated that upon the death of&nbsp; Sy Quia, the women of&nbsp; his house extended their sympathy, as customary, to his widow in China.&nbsp;&nbsp; This, however, is not true, because it appears in the&nbsp; record&nbsp; as&nbsp; a proved fact that Yap Puan Niu died in 1891, while Sy Quia died&nbsp; in&nbsp; this city&nbsp; in 1894,&nbsp;&nbsp; Lim Chio affirmed that Sy By Bo,&nbsp; the alleged son of&nbsp; Sy Quia, had two children by his wife,&nbsp; one of them being&nbsp; Sy Yoc Chay. This is not true, because Sy Yoc Chay was only an adopted son.&nbsp; The witness Yap Si Tan&nbsp; testified that Yap Puan Niu lost a natural child, whose name she did not remember, and in his place adopted Sy Yoc Chay as her son.&nbsp; This fact is not&nbsp; testified to by any&nbsp; of the other witnesses, who simply said that the adoption had been made by Sy By Bo.&nbsp;&nbsp; The witness Yap Chio, 72 years of age, who testified that he had been present at the wedding of Sy&nbsp; Quia with Yap Puan Niu, must have been 8 years old at the time.&nbsp;&nbsp; The other witness, Sy Kai Tit, who was 71 years of age, and who, according to himself, was about 12 years&nbsp; old at the time, stated that he had taken part in the investigation made as to the status and condition&nbsp; of the bride,&nbsp; Yap Puan Niu, having&nbsp; assisted&nbsp; Sy&nbsp; Quia's parents and&nbsp; the&nbsp; mediator in the investigation.&nbsp; Another witness by the name of Sy Boan testified that Sy Quia, when he died in this city, was survived by his wife, Yap Puan Niu,&nbsp; who was still living in China,&nbsp; this being in direct&nbsp; contradiction&nbsp; with the established fact that Yap Puan Niu&nbsp; died before Sy Quia.&nbsp;&nbsp; This witness further said that when Sy Quia returned for the second time to China, in order to attend his parents' funeral, his alleged wife, Yap Puan&nbsp; Niu, was still living,&nbsp; his&nbsp; testimony&nbsp; in this respect being in contradiction with that of the other witnesses, Lim Chio,&nbsp; Yap Si Tan, Yap Chio and Sy Kai&nbsp; Tit.<br><br>The testimony of&nbsp; these witnesses,&nbsp; most of whom have seriously contradicted themselves upon important points in the course of their examination, and some of them, considering the fact that they were very young in 1847, having told a very improbable story, claiming that they had assisted Sy Quia's parents in bringing about the latter's marriage, can be given no credence by the courts to sustain a finding that Sy&nbsp; Quia actually married Yap Puan Niu, much less so the marriages of Sy By&nbsp; Bo and&nbsp; Sy By Guit who are alleged to be the legitimate children&nbsp; of the said Sy Quia and Yap Puan Niu,&nbsp; and the marriage of Sy Jui Niu, the&nbsp; mother of Sian&nbsp; Han, a grandson of Sy By Bo and a great-grandson of Sy Quia, for the reason that there were not introduced in evidence at the trial the matrimonial&nbsp; letters that must have been&nbsp; exchanged before the celebration of these marriages, all of these witnesses having simply said that they attended the wedding of Sy Quia and Yap Puan Niu, that their said sons were also subsequently married and each had two children,&nbsp; and that&nbsp; Sy By Bo adopted Sy Yoc Chay in place of one of his deceased children.&nbsp; From the testimony of these witnesses,&nbsp; taken as&nbsp; a whole, it is impossible to arrive at the truth and to lay the foundation of a just judgment in accordance with the law.<br><br>The witness Sy Hien, who claims to be a younger brother of Sy Quia, and was a witness for the plaintiffs, among the many conflicting statements made by him, as may be seen from his testimony, said&nbsp; that his certificates&nbsp; of marriage, which presumably consisted of similar matrimonial&nbsp; letters or cards,&nbsp; were kept in his own town, and&nbsp; that he was unable&nbsp; to state the difference in age between&nbsp; himself, who was&nbsp; 59 years&nbsp; old, and&nbsp; his&nbsp; brother Sy Quia,&nbsp; who, had&nbsp; he lived, would today&nbsp; be&nbsp; about 80 years old, unless he was permitted to examine a certain book kept&nbsp; in his own home in China&nbsp; (p.&nbsp; 116 of the record).&nbsp; His&nbsp; testimony&nbsp; clearly shows that such matrimonial letters are duly preserved and that the date&nbsp; of birth of the members&nbsp; of&nbsp; a family&nbsp; is noted or entered in a book&nbsp; kept in the paternal residence, in like&nbsp; manner as the death of such members of the family is&nbsp; recorded by&nbsp; mortuary&nbsp; inscriptions&nbsp; on tablets,&nbsp; a practice which&nbsp; is&nbsp; very natural among&nbsp; people who live in civilized communities and cities with&nbsp; a civilization&nbsp; of their own&nbsp; and who, like the Chinese,&nbsp; notwithstanding their remarkable backwardness with reference to more advanced and&nbsp; cultured races, generally speaking are not barbarians and do not live a nomad or savage life.<br><br>The mortuary inscriptions upon one of the&nbsp; tablets presented in evidence at the time of taking the&nbsp; evidence of some of the witnesses who were called by the plaintiffs for the purpose of establishing&nbsp; that the deceased, Sy&nbsp; Quia,&nbsp; had in his lifetime married Yap Puan Niu, an English translation of&nbsp; which&nbsp; appears in the records,&nbsp; are not conclusive or supplementary proof of the said marriage, because they are absolutely false and contrary to the actual facts with reference&nbsp; to&nbsp; Sy Quia, for&nbsp; the latter was still alive in&nbsp; 1891, when he&nbsp; was presumed to be dead&nbsp; according to the said inscriptions, he having actually died in January, 1894; therefore the said mortuary tablet, and the inscriptions appearing thereon, can not serve to corroborate the testimony of the witnesses who testified to the celebration of the marriage, because such tablet&nbsp; and inscriptions are&nbsp; glaringly false, the fact that the&nbsp; witness Sy&nbsp; Peng said that Jthis tablet, together with others, was taken&nbsp; by him from the temple or sanctuary of Sy Quia's family&nbsp; at Am Thau, to be introduced as evidence&nbsp; in this action,&nbsp; to the contrary notwithstanding.&nbsp; The falsity of the inscription of Sy Quia's death, when he&nbsp; was still alive, made upon a tablet which was evidently prepared with remarkable haste and temerity, is borne&nbsp; out by the&nbsp; witness&nbsp; Li&nbsp; Ung&nbsp; Bing,&nbsp; the interpreter of the American consulate, who claimed to be familiar with the laws and customs of his country, for, according to him, where Chinese die out of China no&nbsp; inscription is made at the place of their&nbsp; former residence in&nbsp; China,&nbsp; upon&nbsp; such tablets, of the fact of their death; and as it is a fact, admitted&nbsp; by&nbsp; the plaintiffs, that&nbsp; Sy Quia died in Manila and was buried in La Loma cemetery, there is no doubt that the tablet in question was fraudulently prepared and fabricated to supply the lack of documentary proof as to the so much talked about marriage in China which is the fundamental basis of plaintiffs' claim.<br><br>In the&nbsp; administrative&nbsp; proceedings that&nbsp; Sy Quia must have instituted for the purpose of securing the&nbsp; necessary permission&nbsp; to marry&nbsp; Petronila Encarnacion,&nbsp; and&nbsp; at the investigation which, after the obtaining of such permission, must&nbsp; have been&nbsp; conducted by the&nbsp; ecclesiastical&nbsp; court&nbsp; of the ^bishopric of Vigan, he, Sy Quia, necessarily must have declared that he was single, as evidently he did,&nbsp; according to the&nbsp; testimony of the witness Roman Gray, 72&nbsp; years of age, then a clerk of that court, whose testimony under oath is supported by that of other witnesses, two of them being of the same race as Sy Quia, and in view of the result of the&nbsp; said&nbsp; proceedings and&nbsp; investigation, conducted&nbsp; as aforesaid, the parish priest of the said city of Vigan was authorized to marry Vicente Sy Quia to Petronila Encarnacion, the certificate of marriage reciting the fact that there was no impediment whatever to the performance of the marriage.<br><br>Without the aforesaid permission of the Governor-General, sought&nbsp; and obtained in accordance with sections&nbsp; 34 and 35 of the superior decree of the 20th of December, 1849, the vicar-general of the&nbsp; bishopric of Vigan would not have admitted&nbsp; the testimony&nbsp; given by the&nbsp; witnesses in the investigation for&nbsp; the purpose of&nbsp; proving that Vicente Sy Quia was&nbsp; single and free to marry, nor could the parish priest have performed the marriage&nbsp; ceremony without first securing the necessary authority from the court of the vicar-general in the name of the bishop.<br><br>Therefore the result of those proceedings and the canonical&nbsp; certificate,&nbsp; evidencing&nbsp; the&nbsp; marriage of&nbsp; Vicente Sy Quia and&nbsp; Petronila Encarnacion,&nbsp; corroborate the testimony of the&nbsp; witnesses for the&nbsp; defendants to the effect&nbsp; that Sy Quia was single and had resided for many years in that city before he married Petronila&nbsp; Encarnacion, and that he could not&nbsp; have spent four years&nbsp; at Am Thau,&nbsp; province&nbsp; of Amoy,&nbsp; China, during that period,&nbsp; as alleged.<br><br>With reference to the validity and efficacy of the canonical certificates and the certified copies thereof introduced here in evidence, we adhere to and follow&nbsp; the doctrine laid down by this&nbsp; court in the case of the&nbsp; United States<i> vs,</i> Nicolas Arceo&nbsp; (11 Phil.

the proof&nbsp; introduced by the plaintiffs as to Sy Quia's marriage&nbsp; to Yap&nbsp; Puan Niu, an&nbsp; attempt was made to establish that the said Yap Puan Niu had been twice in Manila, the last time in&nbsp; 1886; that on these two occasions she&nbsp; stopped for five or six months at the house of&nbsp; Sy Tay, Sy Quia's&nbsp; brother, and that Sy Quia frequently called&nbsp; on her&nbsp; at the said house; but,&nbsp; notwithstanding the testimony of some witnesses who testified to this effect, particularly Sy Hien, who claimed to be one of Sy Quia's brothers, and who testified long after Sy Quia's&nbsp; death, we&nbsp; have in&nbsp; the record the sworn statement&nbsp; to the contrary by the&nbsp; Chinese woman, Ana Quang Su, the wife of the said&nbsp; Sy Tay, who positively&nbsp; testified&nbsp; that upon the&nbsp; two occasions that&nbsp; the said Yap Puan Niu stopped as a guest at the house of&nbsp; her husband for a&nbsp; period of five or six months, she had never seen Sy Quia call on her, Yap Puan Niu,&nbsp; and that the said Yap Puan&nbsp; Niu&nbsp; never went out&nbsp; of the house but remained at home as was&nbsp; customary with Chinese women, adding that she would have known if&nbsp; it had been otherwise,&nbsp; because said Yap Puan Niu occupied&nbsp; a room adjoining hers in the same house, the witness being always at home, further saying that her husband Sy Tay supported the said guest, Yap Puan&nbsp; Niu, and paid for her transportation both ways between&nbsp; Manila and China,&nbsp; and that Sy&nbsp; Joe Lien&nbsp; and&nbsp; Sy Yoc&nbsp; Chay, who on successive dates came to Manila from China, also stopped at her, the witness's house, where they lived at the expense and under&nbsp; the&nbsp; orders of&nbsp; her husband Sy Tay.&nbsp; The testimony of&nbsp; this witness&nbsp; is of the utmost importance, and has not been impugned&nbsp; or discredited in any way in this case.<br><br>The witness, Roman&nbsp; Gray, above referred to, affirmed that while he was clerk of the ecclesiastical court of Vigan, which position he had held since 1850, he met the Chinaman&nbsp; Sy Quia when&nbsp; the latter went to his&nbsp; court for&nbsp; the purpose of being baptized as a Christian, stating that&nbsp; the said Sy Quia several years thereafter, in 1853, presented a petition for permission to marry, whereupon the necessary proceedings were instituted, in which said proceedings two Chinese witnesses and Sy Quia himself stated&nbsp; under oath that Sy Quia was single and free to marry, and a decree was subsequently&nbsp; entered authorizing the performance of the marriage with Petronila&nbsp; Encarnacion, the witness further stating that he&nbsp; had read the proceedings but that in 1898 the papers were destroyed by the insurgents, who&nbsp; removed everything from&nbsp; the place where the&nbsp; archives were kept and occupied the premises for some&nbsp; length of time.<br><br>Aside from what has been said before,&nbsp; there&nbsp; is no other evidence in the record to show that the&nbsp; plaintiffs, particularly Sy Chua Niu,&nbsp; Sy&nbsp; Joe Lieng and Sy Yoc Chay, were ever recognized as legitimate grandchildren and adopted grandchild, respectively, and&nbsp; that Sian Han&nbsp; is the greatgrandchild of the said Sy Quia, nor is&nbsp; there any proof to show that the plaintiffs Sy&nbsp; Joe&nbsp; Lieng and&nbsp; Sy Chua Niu have been&nbsp; continuously in possession of the legal status of children of the said Sy By Guit, and the said Sy Yoc Chay as the adopted child&nbsp; of&nbsp; Sy By Bo,&nbsp; and Sian Han as the grandchild of the&nbsp; said Sy By Bo, who, as well as Sy&nbsp; By Guit, is said to be the&nbsp; legitimate son of Sy&nbsp; Quia by his wife, Yap Puan Niu.<br><br>Further, there is no evidence to the effect&nbsp; that Sy&nbsp; Quia had ever provided for the support of Yap Puan Niu, nor that Petronila&nbsp; Encarnacion at any time delivered&nbsp; money,&nbsp; as alleged, to Sy Joe Lieng and Sy Yoc Chay by reason of their hereditary&nbsp; income,&nbsp; inasmuch&nbsp; as&nbsp; the delivery of the&nbsp; sum of ?4,000 to the said&nbsp; Sy&nbsp; Joe Lieng, entered in a book kept by Sy Tay, as per the&nbsp; copy of the entries appearing on page 300 of the book marked "A.&nbsp; S.," is&nbsp; no proof of the&nbsp; payment of a part of the&nbsp; inheritance, and without any express declaration on the part of Petronila Encarnacion, an entry in a book kept by the firm 'of Sy Tay could not be binding upon the said Encarnacion, this, aside from the fact that the entries do not show the reason why this sum of P4,000 was charged to&nbsp; the account of Petronila Encarnacion and credited to Sy Joe Lieng; and, even if we admit as true the statement of the witness Emilio Medina that in his presence, the said Sy Joe Lieng received an additional sum of P2,000 from Petronila&nbsp; Encarnacion&nbsp; there&nbsp; is no evidence to show why this sum was paid to and received by the said Sy Joe Lieng;&nbsp; the witness himself said that the receipt made out at the time set&nbsp; forth that the&nbsp; money was for commercial purposes. &nbsp;<br><br>It likewise appears from the record that the plaintiffs, who now seek to be recognized as&nbsp; the&nbsp; grandchildren, and Sian Han as the great-grandchild of the deceased Sy Quia, incidentally attempting to recover the property which the said Sy Quia left at the time of his death,&nbsp; have not shown by competent documentary proof that Sy By Bo and Sy By Guit were in fact the children of Sy Quia by his wife Yap Puan Niu; that Sy Yoc Lieng and Sy Chua Niu are the children of Sy By Guit; that Sy Yoc Chay is the adopted child&nbsp; of Sy By Bo, and Sian Han the son of Sy Jui Niu, who was the daughter of the said Sy By Bo, for the parentage and affiliation of the said parties,&nbsp; as well as&nbsp; the marriage of Sy By&nbsp; Bo and Sy By Guit,&nbsp; the&nbsp; adoption of Sy Yoc Chay,&nbsp; and the marriage of Sy Jui Niu, should have been established&nbsp; by means of the documents in which such facts&nbsp; are customarily recorded, as stated by Sy Hien, one of the witnesses&nbsp; for the plaintiffs and who also was alleged to be a brother&nbsp; of Sy&nbsp; Quia; the testimony of witnesses, the most dangerous and risky of evidence, not being sufficient to sustain&nbsp; a finding that the court erred in its estimation of&nbsp; the facts, since&nbsp; the preponderance of the evidence must be fixed precisely&nbsp; where the judge believes the truth lies, taking into&nbsp; consideration the facts which were sought to be established,&nbsp; together with the nature of&nbsp; the&nbsp; same and the circumstances of the case; and it should be noted that for the lack of documentary evidence it is impossible to determine on what date Sy Quia was actually married, if he was married at all, to Yap Puan Niu; and&nbsp; considering as a&nbsp; whole the evidence introduced by the&nbsp; plaintiffs as to the stay and residence of&nbsp; the said Sy&nbsp; Quia in the city of Vigan, Philippine Islands, during the three or four years when it is alleged he was at Amoy and there married, it can not be said that the preponderance of the evidence lies with the plaintiffs.<br><br>It further appears&nbsp; from the record that while&nbsp; the&nbsp; body of the deceased&nbsp; Vicente Romero Sy&nbsp; Quia&nbsp; was&nbsp; lying in state&nbsp; at the house&nbsp; where he died, in&nbsp; January, 1894, for the purpose of performing the ceremony of&nbsp; robing a descendant of the deceased&nbsp; with the nine silk suits which had been prepared for the corpse in accordance with the Chinese custom, and although Sy Hien, a brother of the&nbsp; deceased, was&nbsp; in charge&nbsp; of the ceremonies, it did not occur&nbsp; to him to dress Sy Yoc Chay in&nbsp; these garments, he, Sy Yoc Chay, being the&nbsp; son of By By Bo, and if the said Sy Hien thought that this would not be proper for the reason that Sy Yoc Chay was merely an adopted son, it is significant that Sy Joe Lieng, who was also present or at least in the house, was not dressed in&nbsp; the said nine suits, but the same were worn by Tomas Sy Quia, the eldest son of Gregorio, who for this purpose was expressly taken out of the&nbsp; college where he&nbsp; was&nbsp; at the time, as testified to by&nbsp; several witnesses, among&nbsp; them Macario Pavila, a&nbsp; resident merchant of Pangasinan, who chanced to be at the house&nbsp; on&nbsp; that occasion.&nbsp; The&nbsp; statement of Sy Hien to the effect that he did not remember&nbsp; the said ceremony,&nbsp; is not worthy of credit in view of the&nbsp; positive testimony of the defendants Pedro and Juan and of the witness Pavila, who, together with several Chinese, among them Sy Yoc Chay and Sy Joe Lieng, witnessed the same.&nbsp; The latter's statement&nbsp; that he was not present at the ceremony on account of his&nbsp; having temporarily left the house in order to carry out certain instructions received by him, can not be believed, for,&nbsp; if it is a fact that he was the proper person to wear the said nine&nbsp; silk&nbsp; suits according to the customs of his&nbsp; country, the master of the ceremonies would have suspended the same until he,&nbsp; Sy Joe Lieng, returned to the&nbsp; house; but instead&nbsp; of this the eldest son of Gregorio Sy Quia was brought, it is alleged, from the&nbsp; college where he was, his father Gregorio being at the time in Vigan, for the investiture of the nine robes before they were placed upon the corpse.&nbsp; From&nbsp; all this&nbsp; it may&nbsp; be inferred that Sy Yoc Chay, who denied that the said ceremony took place, and Sy Joe Lieng, were not,&nbsp; as a matter of fact, the grandsons of&nbsp; Sy Quia, as Sy Hien,&nbsp; a brother&nbsp; of the deceased, who conducted&nbsp; the ceremony well knew, and&nbsp; that the only descendant to be&nbsp; designated in accordance with&nbsp; traditional customs&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Chinese&nbsp; was Gregorio Sy Quia, the eldest son of the deceased, and, in his absence,&nbsp; the latter's eldest son, Tomas Sy Quia,&nbsp; which&nbsp; designation was&nbsp; accordingly made.<br><br>In&nbsp; addition to the foregoing considerations it should be stated that the sworn statement by&nbsp; Vicente Romero Sy Quia&nbsp; before the civil and ecclesiastical authorities of the city of Vigan in the proceedings which were instituted in 1853 in connection with his marriage in the parish church of that city, the continued possession for&nbsp; a period of many years of the status of a single man enjoyed by&nbsp; him and recognized and&nbsp; accepted by the&nbsp; whole community of the capital of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Province&nbsp; of Ilocos Sur, the belief on the part of his townsmen and neighbors that he was in fact a single&nbsp; man, all these facts being corroborated, as they are, by the uniform testimony of the witnesses for the defendants, and the&nbsp; unexplained silence on the part of his alleged wife, Yap Puan&nbsp; Niu, who might have&nbsp; asserted Whatever rights she may have had as the legitimate wife of Sy&nbsp; Quia before the tribunals of this country, if she reafty had&nbsp; any,&nbsp; completely overcome and destroy the improvised&nbsp; parol&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; as to the&nbsp; pretended marriage of Sy Quia in China, the performance of which was for the first time alleged in December, 1905, after Sy Quia's death and&nbsp; the&nbsp; demise&nbsp; of the latter's brother, Joaquin Martinez Sy&nbsp; Tiong Tay,&nbsp; who, having&nbsp; sheltered in his house&nbsp; the woman&nbsp; Yap Puan Niu on the two occasions aforesaid, as well as the plaintiffs Sy Yoc Chay and Sy Joe Lieng since these latter landed in the Philippines, might&nbsp; have testified to the existence of the marriage, thus supporting the plaintiff's claim to the Sy Quia estate.<br><br>It is admitted by the plaintiffs in this case that&nbsp; two of them, Sy Yoc Chay and&nbsp; Sy Joe Lieng, and the woman Yap Puan&nbsp; Niu,&nbsp; when they&nbsp; came to this country stopped at the house of&nbsp; the said Sy Tiong Tay, who provided for their support&nbsp; and maintenance, gave&nbsp; employment&nbsp; to&nbsp; the first two in his own&nbsp; business and paid for the transportation&nbsp; of the woman to Manila and back to China on the two occasions when&nbsp; she&nbsp; came to this&nbsp; country;&nbsp; and, notwithstanding the truth and certainty of these facts,&nbsp; the plaintiffs, nevertheless,&nbsp; did not even endeavor to&nbsp; show that the said Sy&nbsp; Tiong Tay&nbsp; had defrayed&nbsp; all these expenses by order and on account of his&nbsp; brother Sy Quia, a fact which would appear&nbsp; from the entries in the books kept by him as a merchant, if such payments were really made in behalf of&nbsp; the said Sy&nbsp; Quia.&nbsp; The plaintiffs&nbsp; introduced&nbsp; in evidence a certain book&nbsp; alleged to&nbsp; belong&nbsp; to the firm&nbsp; of Sy Tay&nbsp; for the purpose of establishing a certain payment made by Petronila Encarnacion to the said plaintiffs.&nbsp; They, however, were unable to produce any book to show that the expenses incurred by the&nbsp; said Sy Tay for the maintenance&nbsp; and support of the said plaintiffs and of the woman, Yap Puan Niu,&nbsp; as well as the latter's traveling expenses were paid by and on account of&nbsp; Sy Quia.<br><br>They&nbsp; were unable to explain&nbsp; the&nbsp; reason for&nbsp; these disbursements made by Sy Tay for the benefit of two of the plaintiffs and their alleged grandmother, notwithstanding the&nbsp; fact that&nbsp; death had&nbsp; forever&nbsp; stilled the lips&nbsp; of&nbsp; the two&nbsp; brothers, Sy Tay and Sy&nbsp; Quia, plaintiffs having confined themselves to attributing to him whom they believed to be the wealthier of the two brothers, who unfortunately can not now speak, the paternity and parentage of a family which is not proved to be his.<br><br>This court,&nbsp; in the strictest administration of justice and in conformity with the law, can not admit that plaintiffs have proved four marriages and three generations,&nbsp; since the evidence introduced by them in&nbsp; support of these&nbsp; facts only consists of the testimony of witnesses, most of whom have made conflicting statements and some have contradicted themselves, as for instance the brother of Sy Quia, Sy Hien, whose testimony is absolutely&nbsp; unworthy of&nbsp; credence, and other witnesses have told improbable stories and testified&nbsp; as to things&nbsp; which are not likely to occur in the natural and ordinary course of human events.<br><br>Even assuming that Sy Quia before he became a Christian actually&nbsp; married Yap Puan&nbsp; Niu in 1847, as alleged,&nbsp; and that his second marriage in 1853 with a Christian woman, by whom he had five children and with whom he lived cotentedly&nbsp; in these Islands since the marriage until&nbsp; he&nbsp; died, covering a period of forty-one years, while the first marriage was still in full force and effect, was null and void, he, Vicente Romero Sy Quia, having therefore married twice in violation of the&nbsp; law, the plaintiffs, nevertheless, would not be entitled to the relief sought by them in their complaint.<br><br>There&nbsp; is not the&nbsp; slightest evidence in the record which even tends to indicate that&nbsp; Sy&nbsp; Quia, at&nbsp; the time of his marriage&nbsp; at Vigan in 1853&nbsp; with Petronila Encaraacion, brought any property or money&nbsp; into the conjugal partnership.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact&nbsp; that&nbsp; he did&nbsp; not is not surprising, as he was then a mere clerk in the employment of another Chinaman by the name of Jose Gloria, who was a resident of this city, with a salary of P200 per annum, as per the testimony of Silveria Damian, an aged woman, whose husband&nbsp; was also a&nbsp; Chinaman and worked for the same man that Sy Quia did and for the same salary; while, on the other hand, there is evidence in the record to the effect that Petronila Encarnacion, who belonged to a&nbsp; wealthy family of Vigan, brought to the marriage, as a gift from her parents, the sum of P5,000, which, together&nbsp; with their common labor and industry, was the basis of the fortune accumulated by both husband and wife in the course of years.<br><br>Therefore, even assuming that the second marriage which was contracted by Sy Quia at Vigan&nbsp; was void, while a former marriage alleged to have&nbsp; been performed at Amoy, China,&nbsp; was still&nbsp; in full force and effect, and upon&nbsp; which the plaintiffs in this case base their contention, the second marriage, however,&nbsp; produced civil effects&nbsp; under the laws here in force in 1853, the time&nbsp; when&nbsp; it&nbsp; was performed. These laws are as follows:<br><br>Law&nbsp; 3, title 3, Partida 4, provides&nbsp; in part as follows:<br><blockquote>"Further, if people marry advisably,&nbsp; knowing that such impediment existed, and that for this reason they should not have married, the children which&nbsp; may be born will not be legitimate;&nbsp; but if only one of the contracting parties, and not both, was cognizant of the&nbsp; existence of such impediment, the children will be legitimate, for the ignorance of one of the contracting parties&nbsp; excuses them, and no one can say that they are not legitimate children."</blockquote>Law 1, title 13, <i>Partida </i>4, provides in part as follows:<br><blockquote>"And even if it should happen that between those who are married manifestly in <i>facie&nbsp; ecclesia</i> such impediment exists which would require that the marriage be set aside, the children which may&nbsp; be born to&nbsp; them&nbsp; before the contracting parties&nbsp; knew that the&nbsp; impediment existed, will be legitimate.&nbsp;&nbsp; And&nbsp; this&nbsp; would also be&nbsp; the case&nbsp; if neither of the contracting parties knew that the impediment existed, as well&nbsp; as if only one&nbsp; of them had knowledge thereof, for the ignorance on the part of one of them would make the children legitimate.&nbsp; But&nbsp; if after knowing with&nbsp; certainty that the impediment existed between them, they should have children, any that should&nbsp; be born subsequent thereto will not be legitimate.&nbsp; But,&nbsp; if&nbsp; while such&nbsp; impediment&nbsp; exists without the knowledge of both parties or of either of them, they should be accused before the judges of the Holy Church, and before the impediment is&nbsp; duly established and final judgment entered, children be born to them, such children as may be born while the doubt exists,&nbsp; will be legitimate."</blockquote>The Civil Code has merely reproduced with certain modifications the provisions of the old legislation in force in 1853 as to the civil effects of a void marriage where&nbsp; both parties married in good faith,&nbsp; as well as where only one of them acted in good faith,&nbsp; for&nbsp; whether one or both married&nbsp; in good&nbsp; faith, the&nbsp; marriage will produce civil effects only&nbsp; in favor of the innocent spouse, and of the children born&nbsp; of this void marriage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>If in all the&nbsp; acts of life good&nbsp; faith is&nbsp; to be presumed unless the contrary is&nbsp; proven,&nbsp; it can&nbsp; not&nbsp; be&nbsp; denied that Petronila Encarnacion acted in good faith when she married Vicente Romero Sy Quia in 1853, since there is no evidence in the record to the&nbsp; effect that she knew before or after her marriage that the said Vicente Romero Sy&nbsp; Quia was married in China to another woman.<br><br>The marriage contracted by a Christian&nbsp; Chinese&nbsp; at the time when Sy&nbsp; Quia was&nbsp; married in the&nbsp; Philippines, was preceded by&nbsp; such formalities, and so many requisites had first to be complied with, that&nbsp; it&nbsp; was difficult, not to say impossible, that in the natural and ordinary course of things the marriage could have been performed if there were any impediment at all thereto.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; the case of Sy&nbsp; Quia, not only for many years was he considered in the city of&nbsp; Vigan by the community at large as a bachelor, his name appearing as such in the municipal census, but it must be&nbsp; fairly assumed that when he instituted the proceedings before the civil authorities, and ecclesiastical proceedings in the ecclesiastical court of Vigan, in order to secure permission and authority to marry in accordance with the various decrees then in force, among them the&nbsp; decree of the 20th of December, 1849, he must&nbsp; have positively&nbsp; said then that he was a bachelor, and this fact must have appeared from the summary investigation conducted by&nbsp; the ecclesiastical authorities of Vigan for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not he was a bachelor and free to marry, and when at last the parish priest of Vigan was authorized to proceed with the marriage ceremony, there is little room for doubt that Petronila Encarnacion, as well as her family, relying upon the result of both&nbsp; proceedings, and&nbsp; upon the&nbsp; license&nbsp; or authority granted&nbsp; by the government,&nbsp; and the authority given by the vicar general in&nbsp; the name of the bishop, for the performance of the marriage, they consented thereto in the best of good faith, particularly Petronila Encarnacion, to the latter's union to Vicente Romero Sy Quia in lawful wedlock.<br><br>If, on the contrary, it were true that Sy Quia had married in&nbsp; China many years&nbsp; before, there is no doubt that he acted in bad faith by deceiving his wife Petronila Encarnacion, as well as the civil and ecclesiastical authorities of this country, perjuring himself.&nbsp;&nbsp; And upon the assumption that the marriage with Petronila Encarnacion was void by reason of the existence of a prior undissolved&nbsp; marriage, the second marriage, nevertheless, produced its civil&nbsp; effects in&nbsp; favor of the deceived spouse, and&nbsp; of the children born to&nbsp; them, who, notwithstanding the nullity of the second&nbsp; marriage, are in&nbsp; the eyes of the law legitimate, as though they had been born of parents lawfully married.<br><br>Therefore, assuming that Vicente Romero Sy Quia acted in bad faith&nbsp; by concealing the fact of&nbsp; his first marriage at the investigation made by the authorities for the purpose of determining&nbsp; whether or not he was a&nbsp; bachelor and free to marry, one of the civil effects&nbsp; produced by the marriage thus rendered void was that Sy Quia thereby absolutely forfeited all his rights and interest to&nbsp; one-half of the conjugal&nbsp; property appearing in the instrument of partition, Exhibit A. F.,&nbsp; and&nbsp; by operation&nbsp; of law&nbsp; all the property which&nbsp; would otherwise have belonged to&nbsp; him, became the property of his wife, Petronila&nbsp; Encarnacion," in&nbsp; accordance with the provisions of the Civil Code applicable to the case in conformity with rule 3&nbsp; of the transitory provisions.<br><br>Law 16, title 17, Partida 7, with reference to this subject, provides:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><blockquote>"Notorious wickedness is committed by men who knowingly marry&nbsp; twice while their first wife is living, and the same may be said&nbsp; of women who marry twice knowing that their first husband&nbsp; is still alive.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because such marriages give offense to God, and bring about great damages and dishonor to those who are deceived, and they should be careful to marry well and properly, as directed by the holy Church, for they would otherwise be married to persons with whom they would later live in sin, and while they endeavor to be happy in their marriage, and have children, the first wife or first husband appears when least expected, and disrupts&nbsp; the marriage, and on account of this rupture many women are dishonored and ruined forever, and men are disgraced in many ways.&nbsp; We therefore command that everyone who should knowingly enter into such a marriage, in any&nbsp; of the manners specified in&nbsp; this law, be hence banished to some island for five years, and that he forfeit whatever&nbsp; he&nbsp; may own&nbsp; at the place&nbsp; where the marriage was performed, and&nbsp; that it be given to his children or his grandchildren,&nbsp; if he has&nbsp; any, and if&nbsp; he has no children or grandchildren, one-half of such property&nbsp; should go to the person deceived,&nbsp; and the other half to the king's chamber ; and if both parties knew that one of them was married, and wilfully&nbsp; married him or her, then both&nbsp; shall be banished, each to a separate&nbsp; island, and the property of either of them who&nbsp; may have no children should go to the king's chamber."</blockquote>Article&nbsp; 1417&nbsp; of the Civil Code provides as follows:<br><blockquote>"The&nbsp; conjugal partnership expires on&nbsp; the dissolution of the marriage or when it&nbsp; is declared void.<br><br>"The&nbsp; spouse&nbsp; who, by&nbsp; reason of&nbsp; his or&nbsp; her bad faith, caused the annulment, shall not receive any&nbsp; share of&nbsp; the property of the partnership."</blockquote>This&nbsp; article embodies and&nbsp; reproduces under&nbsp; different aspects the provisions contained in articles&nbsp; 72, 1333, subsection&nbsp; 3,&nbsp; 1373, 1378, and&nbsp; 1429 of the same code, and&nbsp; a mere reading of this article, together with&nbsp; the provisions of law 16 of the <i>Partidas</i> above quoted, will show the difference between the two.&nbsp; It will be noticed that the code contains more&nbsp; favorable and less&nbsp; strict provisions on this subject than the&nbsp; law of the <i>Partidas</i>, wherefore, in accordance with&nbsp; rule 3&nbsp; of the transitory&nbsp; provisions of the said code,&nbsp; the intestate succession&nbsp; of the deceased Vicente Romero Sy Quia should be&nbsp; governed and regulated by the new code,&nbsp; which&nbsp; was&nbsp; in force on January 9,&nbsp; 1894,&nbsp; the date of Sy Quia's death.<br><br>True,&nbsp; article 72 of&nbsp; the&nbsp; said code is included in title 4, the application and enforcement of which in these Islands was suspended&nbsp; under the former sovereignty;&nbsp; but there is no doubt that article 1417 and&nbsp; the other sections cited are&nbsp; now in&nbsp; force, said article 1417 providing&nbsp; that&nbsp; the spouse who by reason&nbsp; of his or her bad faith causes the annulment of the marriage, shall not&nbsp; receive any&nbsp; share of the property of the conjugal partnership.<br><br>It should be&nbsp; borne&nbsp; in mind that&nbsp; on account of the unexplained silence of Yap&nbsp; Puan Niu&nbsp; during her lifetime, and the silence of the plaintiffs during Sy&nbsp; Quia's lifetime, the conjugal partnership&nbsp; constituted in 1853 between Sy Quia and Petronila&nbsp; Encarnacion was dissolved in 1894 by the death of the husband, and only then, when the Civil Code was already in operation, would&nbsp; their&nbsp; presumptive heirs have acquired a right to claim the inheritance, for the right to inherit&nbsp; while the&nbsp; deceased&nbsp; was still&nbsp; living is a mere right in expectancy,&nbsp; and not&nbsp; until&nbsp; after the decease of the person whose succession is&nbsp; in concern can such a right be said to&nbsp; exist or to be duly acquired.&nbsp;&nbsp; See the preamble to the Civil Code and the doctrine laid down by the supreme court of Spain on the subject in its judgment of the 24th of June, 1897, wherein the&nbsp; court said:<br><blockquote>"That upon the settlement and distribution of the estate of a person who dies subsequent to the&nbsp; promulgation of the Civil Code, any action for the recovery of the property of the estate&nbsp; should be governed by the&nbsp; provisions of the said code,&nbsp; in conformity with&nbsp; the first rule&nbsp; and the one preceding the last,&nbsp; of the&nbsp; transitory provisions, because the rule as to the nonretroactivity of the new law only applies to rights acquired under the former legislation;&nbsp; and it is a well-known fact that hereditary rights exist only after the demise of the decedent;&nbsp; and the trial court having so decided, it did not infringe the&nbsp; provisions of laws 11 ancf 12, title 13, Partida 6, and the general provision&nbsp; of the transitory&nbsp; rules for the&nbsp; application&nbsp; of the Civil Code."</blockquote>However,&nbsp; as&nbsp; a matter of&nbsp; fact the action&nbsp; instituted by plaintiffs in 1905,&nbsp; claiming the property&nbsp; left by Sy&nbsp; Quia at the time of his death, is based especially upon the alleged nullity of the second marriage on account of the existence of the former performed in China.&nbsp; Therefore,&nbsp; the rights claimed by the&nbsp; plaintiffs should&nbsp; be determined&nbsp; in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Code which has been in operation since 1889 and&nbsp; under which the rights now asserted&nbsp; by the plaintiffs&nbsp; might&nbsp; have sprung&nbsp; and&nbsp; been acquired&nbsp; by them,&nbsp; this&nbsp; assuming&nbsp; that the&nbsp; alleged&nbsp; first marriage was actually performed in China and that the claimants were in&nbsp; fact the&nbsp; issue of the said&nbsp; pretended marriage of Sy Quia&nbsp; and&nbsp; Yap Puan Niu.<br><br>Since the 9th of&nbsp; June, 1853, when Vicente Romero&nbsp; Sy Quia married Petronila Encarnacion, the conjugal partnership commenced to exist between the two spouses.&nbsp; All the property&nbsp; acquired by&nbsp; them up to the time of the dissolution of the said partnership&nbsp; on&nbsp; account of the death of Sy Quia on January 9, 1894,&nbsp; belonged to this partnership. (Law 1, title 3, of the Fuero Real; laws 1, 3 and 4,&nbsp; title 4, book 10,&nbsp; of the<i> Novisima Recopilacion;</i> and arts.&nbsp; 1393, 1401, 1403-1407, Civil Code.)<br><br>During Sy Quia's lifetime&nbsp; the validity of his marriage with Petronila Encarnacion,&nbsp; as has been said before, was never questioned, no one having indicated any defect which rendered the same void.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was only afterJus^death that the plaintiffs ventured to attack the validity of the same by claiming that they were his legitimate&nbsp; heirs&nbsp; and as such entitled to his estate.<br><br>The Laws of the <i>Partidas </i>above cited, as well as the Civil Code, both recognize as a fact that a marriage contracted in&nbsp; good faith,&nbsp; by one at least of the parties&nbsp; to the same, produces the same&nbsp; civil&nbsp; effects&nbsp; as a valid marriage with reference to the innocent spouse and the children born of such marriage,&nbsp; even though the same be subsequently declared null and void.<br><br>It can not be denied that Petronila Encarnacion married Sy Quia in the best of good faith, there being not the slightest proof to the contrary so far as the&nbsp; record shows.&nbsp; Therefore, being innocent, she must&nbsp; be held to have acquired all the&nbsp; rights to which a wife is ordinarily entitled,&nbsp; and neither&nbsp; she&nbsp; nor her children can be made&nbsp; to suffer the consequences of the nullity of such marriage, this, assuming that the&nbsp; marriage was void;&nbsp; nor&nbsp; can they in any event be&nbsp; made to&nbsp; suffer the consequences of the bad&nbsp; faith of her husband Sy Quia.<br><br>The nullity of the marriage, once declared by the courts, may&nbsp; deprive the partnership created by the&nbsp; marriage of the alleged spouses of its&nbsp; otherwise legal character, but can not destroy the legal consequences of the marital union while it existed.&nbsp; Consequently the children are considered legitimate, and&nbsp; the&nbsp; innocent&nbsp; spouse&nbsp; is unquestionably entitled to one-half of the conjugal property acquired during the marriage.<br><br>From the legal provisions above cited, especially the sections of the&nbsp; Civil Code referred to,&nbsp; it necessarily follows that the half of the conjugal property to which Vicente Romero Sy Quia would have been otherwise entitled, on account of the&nbsp; alleged nullity of his&nbsp; marriage with Petronila Encarnacion and of&nbsp; his&nbsp; bad faith&nbsp; in contracting the same, was forfeited by him and&nbsp; by&nbsp; operation&nbsp; of the&nbsp; law passed to the other spouse, Encarnacion; and the plaintiffs, in their alleged capacity&nbsp; as legitimate descendants of the said Sy Quia,&nbsp; deceased, can not now claim the said property, as&nbsp; the decedent, by the express provisions of the law, absolutely forfeited&nbsp; his right to the said half of the property acquired during&nbsp; the&nbsp; marriage.&nbsp; Such marriage must be&nbsp; considered null&nbsp; and void if it is true, as alleged by the&nbsp; plaintiffs, that Sy Quia's marriage with Yap Puan Niu was still in full force and effect when he married Petronila&nbsp; Encarnacion.<br><br>Counsel for&nbsp; plaintiffs now ask this court to modify the judgment appealed from and to declare that the said plaintiffs are&nbsp; the only legitimate heirs of Sy Quia and consequently entitled to his entire estate, together with all rents and profits, for which judgment should be entered in their favor with costs.&nbsp; In support of their contention they have assigned&nbsp; various errors as committed by the&nbsp; trial court, among them that the court erred in finding as a conclusion of law that the said Sy Quia was a subject of the Chinese Empire&nbsp; and that his estate should&nbsp; be distributed in accordance with the laws of China.<br><br>It is&nbsp; an admitted fact that Sy Quia was a native Chinaman and therefore a foreigner; that he came to this country in 1839 or 1840, when he was 12 years of age.&nbsp; He having resided&nbsp; in these Islands since then and until January, 1894, when he died, that is to say, for a period of more than 53 years, having obtained for this purpose the necessary license or permission,&nbsp; and having&nbsp; been converted to the Catholic religion, marrying a native woman in the city of Vigan and establishing&nbsp; his domicile first&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Province of Ilocos and later in this city of Manila, with the intention of residing here permanently, engaging in business generally and acquiring real estate, it is unquestionable that by virtue of all these acts he acquired&nbsp; a residence and became definitely domiciled in these Islands with the&nbsp; same rights as any nationalized citizen in accordance&nbsp; with the&nbsp; laws in force in these Islands while he lived here and until his death.<br><br>It should be noticed that, as the laws have no retroactive effect, in&nbsp; order to determine what rights Sy Quia had actually acquired&nbsp; since he removed to the Philippines in 1839 or 1840, it will be necessary to resort to the laws in force at that time; and the provisions of the Civil Code promulgated in November, 1889, could not affect in the least rights thus acquired by virtue of his&nbsp; long residence&nbsp; in these Islands.&nbsp;&nbsp; Article 3 of the Civil Code is as follows:&nbsp; "Laws shall not have retroactive effect unless&nbsp; otherwise prescribed therein."&nbsp; This provision is in&nbsp; accordance with the provisions ofiaw 15, title 14, <i>Partida</i> 3.<br><br>The legislation then in force on the subject of naturalization and residence of foreigners in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippine Islands will be found in the following laws.&nbsp;&nbsp; Law 1, title 11, book 6 of the <i>Novisima Recopilacion</i>, is as follows:<br><blockquote>"We permit that the subjects of other kingdoms (provided they are Catholics and friendly to our&nbsp; Crown)&nbsp; who&nbsp; may desire&nbsp; to come here to practice their trade or profession may do so, and we command that if they do now practice some trade&nbsp; or profession&nbsp; and live twenty leagues&nbsp; inland from any port, they&nbsp; shall be forever exempt from the&nbsp; payment of taxes, and shall be likewise exempt,&nbsp; for a&nbsp; period of six years,&nbsp; from&nbsp; the payment of municipal taxes and from the&nbsp; performance&nbsp; of&nbsp; any&nbsp; ordinary&nbsp; or extraordinary services, as&nbsp; well as from holding office as members of municipal councils at the&nbsp; place&nbsp; where&nbsp; they may&nbsp; reside; and they, like other&nbsp; residents,&nbsp; shall be permitted to use&nbsp; the common pastures and&nbsp; enjoy all the&nbsp; privileges&nbsp; accorded to the latter: and we hereby command the authorities to provide them with house and&nbsp; lands, if necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp; And other foreigners, whether they have any trade or profession, <i><i>provided&nbsp; they have lived in this kingdom for a period&nbsp; of ten years</i></i>&nbsp; in a home&nbsp; of&nbsp; their own,&nbsp; and&nbsp; have been married to native women for a period of six years, shall be admitted to all the offices of the republic except to&nbsp; those of magistrate, governor, mayor,&nbsp; alderman, warden, treasurer, revenue collector,&nbsp; secretary of city council, or any&nbsp; other government position of trust.&nbsp; As to these latter offices, as well as to all ecclesiastical offices,&nbsp; all&nbsp; existing laws shall continue in full force and effect, etc."</blockquote>And law 3 of the same title and book of the <i>Novisima Recopilacion </i>provides:<br><blockquote>"There shall be considered as denizens, in the first place. all foreigners who obtain the privilege of naturalization and those who are born in these kingdoms; those who residing therein may be converted to our holy Catholic faith; those who, being self-supporting, establish their domicile therein; those who ask for and obtain residence in any town thereof; those who marry&nbsp; a native woman of the said kingdoms and are domiciled therein; and in the case of a foreign woman who marries a native man, she thereby becomes subject to the same laws and acquires the same domicile as her husband; those who&nbsp; establish&nbsp; themselves in the country by acquiring real property; those who have a trade or profession and go there to practice the&nbsp; same; also those who practice some mechanical&nbsp; trade therein&nbsp; or keep a&nbsp; retail store; those who hold public or honorary offices or any such position whatsoever&nbsp; which&nbsp; can&nbsp; only be&nbsp; held by natives; those who enjoy the&nbsp; privilege of the common pastures and other privileges usually accorded to&nbsp; other residents; those who shall reside in the said kingdoms for a period of ten years in a home&nbsp; of&nbsp; their own;&nbsp; and also&nbsp; those foreigners who, in accordance with the common law, royal orders and other laws&nbsp; of the kingdoms, may have become naturalized or acquired residence therein, they being obliged to pay the same taxes as the natives&nbsp; for the legal&nbsp; and fundamental reason that they also participate in their privileges, etc."</blockquote>Article 18 of the&nbsp; Code&nbsp; of Commerce of&nbsp; May 30,&nbsp; 1829, which was&nbsp; in operation until 1888, is as follows:<br><blockquote>"Foreigners who have become naturalized or&nbsp; have acquired residence in Spain in the manner provided by&nbsp; law may freely engage in commerce with the same rights&nbsp; and under the same conditions as natives of the kingdom."</blockquote>Although the royal decree of the 17th of November, 1852, was not extended to the&nbsp; colonies, with&nbsp; the exception of section&nbsp; 28 thereof, nevertheless, it&nbsp; is&nbsp; only&nbsp; proper to&nbsp; call attention to the provisions of the said decree in so far as they have any bearing upon the case&nbsp; at bar,&nbsp; in view of the provisions of laws 1 and 2, title 1, book 2, of the Compilation of the Laws of the Indies, which direct that the laws of Castile shall be&nbsp; observed in all cases not otherwise covered by said laws.&nbsp; Section 2 of the said royal decree of 1852 is as follows:<br><blockquote>"Foreigners who&nbsp; have gained or obtained&nbsp; a residence, in accordance with&nbsp; the&nbsp; laws, shall be&nbsp; considered Spanish subjects."</blockquote>Section 3 provides that all other foreigners who reside in Spain without having taken out naturalization papers, or otherwise gained a residence therein, shall continue to be foreigners.&nbsp; And section 12 provides:<br><blockquote>"Those persons shall&nbsp; not be legally considered as&nbsp; foreigners,&nbsp; under&nbsp; any&nbsp; circumstances, who&nbsp; have&nbsp; failed to register as such in the registry of transients or domiciled persons kept by the civil&nbsp; authorities of the provinces or with the consuls of the respective nations."</blockquote>It is a proven and undeniable fact that Sy Quia resided in the Philippines for more than fifty years, he having only absented himself occasionally&nbsp; for&nbsp; a short time&nbsp; with the intention of immediately returning to the Islands; and it is also&nbsp; a fact that in various documents and public instruments&nbsp; executed&nbsp; before notaries&nbsp; public, which have&nbsp; been introduced in evidence marked as&nbsp; "Exhibits 1, 2, and 3," said Vicente Romero&nbsp; Sy Quia has uniformly stated that he was a resident of the district of Binondo, having declared in one of the said documents that he was a freeholder.&nbsp; If the Chinaman Vicente Romero Sy Quia on account of his continuous residence in these Islands for a&nbsp; period of more than fifty&nbsp; years, and by virtue&nbsp; of the fact that he&nbsp; had permanently established&nbsp; himself&nbsp; in&nbsp; this country, living in a house of his own, with his wife and children, and having acquired real estate therein, did become a domiciled denizen under the&nbsp; laws&nbsp; then&nbsp; in&nbsp; force,&nbsp; even if&nbsp; it be held that the royal decree of the 17th of November, 1852, was applicable to these Islands by virtue of the provision&nbsp; contained in the Laws of the Indies, the legal status of Vicente Romero Sy&nbsp; Quia has not changed,&nbsp; because the provisions of the said decree do not in any way affect the rights acquired by&nbsp; him; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; supreme court of Spain&nbsp; in&nbsp; a judgment of the 30th of April, 1861, in construing this provision of the law, declared&nbsp; and held that the purpose of the royal decree of the&nbsp; 17th of November, 1852, was not to promulgate a new law, but merely to condense and embody in one single act the various provisions then in force with reference to foreigners, and to preserve the <i>fuero de extranjeria</i> (the rights which&nbsp; foreigners had in certain cases to invoke their own&nbsp; laws) in the same manner as it existed before. In&nbsp; another judgment of the 29th&nbsp; of August of the same year the said&nbsp; supreme court of Spain held that under the provisions of law 3, title 11, book 6, of the <i>Novisima Recopilacion</i>, there should be&nbsp; considered as domiciled denizens of Spain all foreigners who,&nbsp; being self-supporting, established their domicile in the country; the double inscription in the registry, as required by the royal&nbsp; decree of the&nbsp; 17th of November,&nbsp; 1852, being no obstacle thereto.<br><br>Many years prior&nbsp; to the promulgation&nbsp; of the Civil Code in these Islands, there was published in the Official Gazette of this city on September 18,&nbsp; 1870, the decretal law of the 4th of July of&nbsp; the said year relating to foreigners,&nbsp; section 2 of which provides:<br><blockquote>"Foreigners who, in accordance with the laws,&nbsp; shall become naturalized&nbsp; or&nbsp; gain residence in&nbsp; any town of&nbsp; the Spanish provinces beyond the seas, shall be considered as Spanish subjects."</blockquote>After dividing into three different classes the foreigners who should come into and establish themselves in the provinces beyond&nbsp; the&nbsp; seas,&nbsp; classifying them respectively&nbsp; as domiciled,&nbsp; transient,&nbsp; and immigrant foreigners,&nbsp; the&nbsp; said section provided that&nbsp; "Domiciled foreigners are those&nbsp; who have a regular residence and have lived for three years in any province or who may have registered as such residents in the registry&nbsp; of domiciled, persons kept for this purpose," etc.<br><br>Section 7 of the said&nbsp; decree&nbsp; provides&nbsp; as follows:<br><blockquote>"Any foreigner residing in the provinces beyond the seas, in order to be&nbsp; considered as such foreigner under the laws of the country, shall register in the registry of foreigners to be kept for this purpose&nbsp; by the civil supreme authorities and by the consuls of their respective nations."</blockquote>The above-quoted sections of the said decree are&nbsp; in harmony with similar sections contained in the decree of the 17th of November,&nbsp; 1852,&nbsp; which,&nbsp; as has been said, was never extended to these Islands - with the exception&nbsp; of section&nbsp; 28 thereof relating&nbsp; to the settlement of the estates of&nbsp; deceased&nbsp; foreigners.&nbsp; The doctrine&nbsp; laid&nbsp; down&nbsp; by the supreme court of Spain with reference to the interpretation&nbsp; and proper construction of&nbsp; the said&nbsp; decree&nbsp; is not, therefore,&nbsp; inconsistent with the provisions of the&nbsp; decree or law of 1870, also relating to foreigners.<br><br>True that prior&nbsp; to 1870 there existed&nbsp; in these&nbsp; Islands no&nbsp; registry of foreigners and that even the civil registry was not then in operation, the provisions of titles 4 and 12 of the Civil&nbsp; Code relating thereto having been suspended by&nbsp; telegraphic order of the 29th&nbsp; of December, 1889.&nbsp; It is also true that no registry was kept by the foreign consulates and that there was&nbsp; no Chinese consul here&nbsp; at that time.&nbsp; However, if the Chinaman&nbsp; By Quia Kad really intended to&nbsp; preserve his nationality and the&nbsp; protection&nbsp; of the laws of this country, he would have registered&nbsp; in the registry&nbsp; which&nbsp; was&nbsp; kept by the&nbsp; Government here after the publication in these Islands of the said decree of 1870; and&nbsp; under the&nbsp; theory of the&nbsp; law a foreigner,&nbsp; in order to have the right&nbsp; to invoke the laws of his&nbsp; own country, must register&nbsp; in the&nbsp; proper registries as such&nbsp; foreigner; if Sy Quia did not see fit to so register at any time prior to his death in&nbsp; 1894,&nbsp; we must presume&nbsp; that he&nbsp; did not&nbsp; do&nbsp; so because&nbsp; he desired to, preserve&nbsp; the rights&nbsp; which he had acquired as a resident of Manila.<br><br>Continuous and permanent residence&nbsp; in the country for a period of years,&nbsp; and the rights&nbsp; thereby&nbsp; acquired as&nbsp; a denizen of any town,&nbsp; were always taken into consideration by the Spanish legislators&nbsp; in determining the&nbsp; rights of&nbsp; a foreigner residing: in Spanish territory.&nbsp;&nbsp; The constitution of 1812 provides in section 5 that there shall be considered as Spanish subjects:<br><blockquote>"2. Foreigners who have obtained from the cortes a certificate&nbsp; of naturalization;&nbsp; and,&nbsp; 3. Those&nbsp; who&nbsp; have otherwise gained&nbsp; residence in accordance with the&nbsp; laws of the country&nbsp; and lived as such residents for a period of&nbsp; ten years in any town of&nbsp; the kingdom."</blockquote>A similar&nbsp; provision is contained in section 1 of the constitution of 1845, paragraph 4 of which&nbsp; is as follows:<br><blockquote>"Spanish subjects&nbsp; are those who, not having&nbsp; otherwise obtained a certificate of naturalization, have, nevertheless, gained residence in any town of the kingdom."</blockquote>It becomes necessary to refer to the Spanish laws which were applicable or in operation&nbsp; in&nbsp; these Islands at&nbsp; the time that&nbsp; Vicente Romero Sy Quia gained residence and acquired the status of a domiciled denizen of the municipality of Vigan and subsequently of this city of&nbsp; Manila, for the reason that they were the only laws regulating his personal rights.<br><br>In addition to what has been said for the purpose of demonstrating that Vicente Romero Sy Quia acquired the legal status&nbsp; of a domiciled resident&nbsp; of these Islands,&nbsp; we should not forget to say that the Chinese residents of these Islands under the former sovereignty, and particularly at the time that Sy Quia gained a residence in&nbsp; this Archipelago, were&nbsp; governed by the Laws of the Indies and other special laws, some&nbsp; of them quite ancient;&nbsp; although they had no consul or any other representative of the Chinese Government,&nbsp; they, nevertheless, had a gobernadorcillo who was&nbsp; elected by their&nbsp; most prominent citizens, subject to the approval of the Governor-General.&nbsp; They were governed by laws different from the general laws of the country and paid a tax different from that which was paid by the natives and foreigners,&nbsp; and, upon their landing for the purpose of establishing themselves in the Islands, they had to obtain what was known as a resident's license and secure passports and permits whenever they desired to&nbsp; leave the Islands, and&nbsp; not only had&nbsp; they to obtain such permission from the Government,&nbsp; but&nbsp; also from their native wife, if they&nbsp; were married.&nbsp; It should be noticed also that&nbsp; they were not permitted to land in Manila without first obtaining a permit from the Government,&nbsp; and that they had to state&nbsp; before the&nbsp; Chinese immigration authorities whether they came here as mere transients, or visitors for a period of three months, which could be extended&nbsp; if they really intended to establish themselves in the country.&nbsp; For this purpose certain proceedings were instituted before the immigrant was given the said&nbsp; resident's license.&nbsp;&nbsp; This license entitled them to&nbsp; more liberty and privileges in their business journeys&nbsp; and excursions through the provinces than the other&nbsp; transients&nbsp; who merely had&nbsp; permission to&nbsp; stay here three months.&nbsp; All this may be verified by reference to the decrees&nbsp; of the 31st&nbsp; of August, 1839;&nbsp; 16th of&nbsp; September, 1840; 13th of December, 1843; and 20th of December, 1849. <br><br>It should be&nbsp; noticed&nbsp; further that section 19 of the&nbsp; said decree of the 16th&nbsp; of September, 1840, provided that&nbsp; the children&nbsp; always follow&nbsp; the&nbsp; status of their father and pay the same taxes,&nbsp; except the children&nbsp; of Chinese,&nbsp; who, according to the&nbsp; decree of the&nbsp; 2d of May,&nbsp; 1786, were&nbsp; considered as&nbsp; Chinese <i>mestizos</i>.&nbsp; These decrees may be found in the work entitled&nbsp; <i>"Legislacion Ultra Marina</i>,"&nbsp; by Rodriguez San Pedro, vol. 2, pp. 471-483, and vol. 8, p. 401.<br><br>The foregoing will&nbsp; clearly show that Vicente Romero Sy Quia&nbsp; gained residence in these Islands under&nbsp; the laws of the <i>Novisima Recopilacion.</i>&nbsp; Therefore&nbsp; the&nbsp; questions raised by those who now claim to be his descendants should be decided in accordance with the laws in force in the Philippines to which&nbsp; Sy Quia submitted himself from the time he applied for a resident's license and abstained from&nbsp; registering in 1870 as a foreigner.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the&nbsp; property left by him being real, the&nbsp; same is subject to&nbsp; the laws of&nbsp; the country in which&nbsp; it is located.<br><br>In support of what has been said with reference to&nbsp; the special laws governing&nbsp; in the Philippines&nbsp; concerning Chinese,&nbsp; we will cite the&nbsp; decision in a case where a Chinese Christian by the name of Bonifacio Lim Tuaco requested that the&nbsp; children of&nbsp; Chinese married&nbsp; to&nbsp; native&nbsp; women, whether pure natives or half-castes,&nbsp; pay the same taxes as their father and be permitted to wear the same costume as the latter up&nbsp; to the age&nbsp; of 25.&nbsp; The Spanish Government, inspired by the&nbsp; traditional spirit of the ancient special&nbsp; laws relating to&nbsp; Chinese residents&nbsp; in&nbsp; these Islands, after consulting various heads of departments and obtaining the opinion&nbsp; of the Philippine council, denied the said petition&nbsp; in a&nbsp; royal order of&nbsp; the 24th of February, 1880, which was communicated to the Governor-General of these Islands and published in the Official Gazette April 17, 1880.<br><br>The plaintiffs in this case have invoked certain provisions of the Chinese laws as one&nbsp; of the&nbsp; grounds of the action by them&nbsp; instituted and now contend that&nbsp; the&nbsp; estate&nbsp; of Vicente Romero&nbsp; Sy&nbsp; Quia, deceased, should be distributed in accordance with the laws of that&nbsp; country.&nbsp; Even disregarding the fact that the plaintiffs should have, but have not,&nbsp; alleged in their complaint, as one of the facts&nbsp; constituting their cause of action,&nbsp; the existence of a law&nbsp; passed and&nbsp; promulgated&nbsp; in&nbsp; China,&nbsp; the&nbsp; existence&nbsp; of which law, being foreign, should&nbsp; have been alleged in&nbsp; the complaint, the fact&nbsp; remains that there&nbsp; is absolutely no evidence&nbsp; in the record as to the existence of the Chinese laws referred to by plaintiffs in their subsequent pleadings, the evidence of this character introduced by them consisting of&nbsp; books or pamphlets&nbsp; written&nbsp; in&nbsp; Chinese characters and marked "Exhibits AH, AI, AJ, and AK," which they claim&nbsp; contain a compilation of the laws of China, being useless and of no value.<br><br>It may be that they&nbsp; contain, as plaintiffs claim, the laws of China, but we have&nbsp; no Spanish translation of them, they being in the Chinese language, and written with characters which are absolutely unknown to this&nbsp; court and to the defendants.&nbsp; Further, the plaintiffs have not&nbsp; introduced expert testimony in the manner and form&nbsp; prescribed by section&nbsp; 292&nbsp; of the Code of Civil Procedure, and, finally, there is no evidence that these four books or pamphlets were printed by authority of the Chinese Government or that they have been duly authenticated by the certificate of competent authorities&nbsp; or that they&nbsp; are properly sealed with the seal of the nation to which they belong.&nbsp; For this" reason the said books or pamphlets&nbsp; can not, under any circumstances, be considered as documentary proof of the laws of China.<br><br>Section 300 of the Code of Civil Procedure reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"Books printed&nbsp; or published under the authority&nbsp; of the United States, or of one of the States of the United States, or a foreign&nbsp; country, and purporting to&nbsp; contain statutes, codes, or other written law of such&nbsp; State&nbsp; or country, or proved to be&nbsp; commonly admitted in the tribunals of such State or country as evidence of the written law thereof, are admissible in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippine Islands&nbsp; as evidence of such law."</blockquote>Section 301 of the same code provides:<br><blockquote>"A&nbsp; copy of the&nbsp; written law, or other public writing of any State or country, attested by the certificate of the officer having charge of the original,&nbsp; under&nbsp; the seal of the State or country, is&nbsp; admissible as evidence of such law or writing."</blockquote>Section 302 provides as follows:<br><blockquote>"The oral testimony of witnesses, skilled&nbsp; therein,&nbsp; is admissible as evidence of the unwritten&nbsp; law&nbsp; of the United States or of&nbsp; any&nbsp; State of the United&nbsp; States, or foreign country, as are also printed and published books of reports of decisions of the courts of the United States or of such State or country, or proved to be commonly admitted in such courts."</blockquote>The jurisprudence of American and Spanish tribunals is uniform on this subject.&nbsp; For the purposes of this decision however it&nbsp; will be sufficient to refer to the judgment of the supreme court of Spain of the 26th of May, 1887, wherein it is said:<br><blockquote>"Whenever&nbsp; a foreign law is&nbsp; invoked in our tribunals, its existence must be&nbsp; satisfactorily established&nbsp; as any&nbsp; other fact."</blockquote>If the pamphlets or books, written in Chinese characters, do not satisfactorily establish the existence of certain Chinese laws invoked by the plaintiffs, not only because such pamphlets or books lack the aforesaid formalities and requisites, but&nbsp; further because&nbsp; there is&nbsp; no&nbsp; evidence as&nbsp; to the nature of the laws contained in those books or pamphlets and the subjects with which they deal; on the&nbsp; other hand, the two witnesses whose testimony was introduced for the purpose of establishing the authenticity of the laws which, according to the plaintiffs, are contained in the said books, were unable&nbsp; to say positively at least that the book&nbsp; marked Exhibit AH&nbsp; contains an exact copy of the original.&nbsp; And the Chinese&nbsp; consul of this city, Sy&nbsp; Int Chu, after stating that he had never made a regular study of&nbsp; the laws of his country, simply consulting the same in connection with his official reports, admitted that he had never read or seen the original copy of this&nbsp; alleged compilation,&nbsp; the&nbsp; books not being duly certified, adding that he&nbsp; could not say whether the book marked "Exhibit AH" was an exact copy of the original.<br><br>The testimony of the witness&nbsp; Ly Ung Bing, the interpreter, as to&nbsp; the written and unwritten laws of China, does not show, as required by the Code of Civil Procedure, that he knew such&nbsp; laws or&nbsp; that&nbsp; he was acquainted&nbsp; with the nature of the laws alleged to be contained in the said books. He merely confined himself to expressing his own&nbsp; opinion with reference to&nbsp; the two classes of laws.&nbsp; He, not being an expert on the&nbsp; subject thoroughly conversant with the laws of China,&nbsp; his testimony, considering&nbsp; the manner in which&nbsp; he testified, can not even be&nbsp; accepted as&nbsp; partial evidence that the said four books really contain&nbsp; the written and unwritten laws of China.<br><br>From the foregoing facts and provisions of law referred to we conclude:<br><br>First. That it has not been&nbsp; duly established in this case that the Chinaman Sy Quia, married in 1847 at Am Thau, Amoy, China,&nbsp; the woman Yap&nbsp; Puan Niu, or&nbsp; that&nbsp; the plaintiffs are the descendants of the said&nbsp; Sy Quia, for the reason that the marriage of Sy&nbsp; By Bo, Sy By Guit and Sy Jui Niu, respectively,&nbsp; the affiliation&nbsp; and parentage of the latter and of Sy Chua Niu and&nbsp; Sian Han, and the adoption of Sy Yoc Chay have not been proven.<br><br>Second.&nbsp; That, even assuming that Sy Quia actually married Yap Puan Niu in&nbsp; 1847, and that the second marriage with Petronila Encarnacion in&nbsp; 1853 is, therefore, void, Sy Quia having contracted this second marriage in bad&nbsp; faith by concealing the fact that his former wife was still living, his half of the property of the conjugal partnership between him and his second wife, who married him in good faith, was forfeited by operation&nbsp; of law in favor of his said second wife, for although the law recognizes civil effects to a void marriage, it, nevertheless, deprives the party who married in bad faith of his share&nbsp; in the community property acquired during the existence of the marriage&nbsp; up to the time of its&nbsp; annulment.<br><br>Third. That, as a consequence of the foregoing conclusion and&nbsp; under the same hypothesis, the plaintiffs,&nbsp; as the descendants of Sy&nbsp; Quia by his first marriage, have no right to claim Sy Quia's share in the conjugal property acquired during his second marriage with Petronila Encarnacion for the reason that&nbsp; by&nbsp; the express provision of the law the half of the said conjugal property which would have otherwise belonged to the husband was transmitted to Petronila Encarnacion, together with the other half of the said property to which she was rightfully entitled under the law as the deceived wife.<br><br>Fourth. That,&nbsp; under&nbsp; the&nbsp; same hypothesis&nbsp; that the marriage of Sy Quia with&nbsp; Petronila Encarnacion&nbsp; is void, his former marriage not having been dissolved when he married the said Petronila Encarnacion, the children by the second marriage are,&nbsp; nevertheless,&nbsp; legitimate, this being one of the civil effects of a marriage contracted in&nbsp; good faith, as in this case, at least on the part of one of the contracting parties, Petronila Encarnacion.<br><br>Fifth. That&nbsp; Vicente Romero&nbsp; Sy Quia,&nbsp; having become a regularly domiciled denizen under the laws above cited by reason of his long residence in this country for more than fifty years and by reason of the further fact that he married a native woman, established&nbsp; himself&nbsp; in&nbsp; this city with a home of his own, acquired real&nbsp; property and engaged in business generally, most of the property left by him at the time of his death being real property, the questions raised by plaintiffs' petition must be determined in accordance with the laws of the Philippines to&nbsp; which&nbsp; Sy Quia&nbsp; submitted himself when he came to the Islands and secured a residence therein, and not&nbsp; in accordance with any other foreign or unknown law.<br><br>Sixth. That,&nbsp; aside from the fact that it does not specifically appear from the record what are the Chinese laws applicable to the&nbsp; issues&nbsp; of this case, there is no proof of the existence of the Chinese laws referred to by the&nbsp; "plaintiffs, nor is&nbsp; there anything to show that the books or&nbsp; pamphlets introduced by them in&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; contain&nbsp; any specific laws of the&nbsp; Celestial Empire.<br><br>The&nbsp; foregoing disposes explicitly or implicitly, affirmatively or otherwise, of all the questions raised by the various assignments of error submitted by both parties; and in our opinion it is not necessary to dispose of each of them in detail&nbsp; in view&nbsp; of the conclusion at which&nbsp; the&nbsp; court&nbsp; has arrived in this most important litigation.<br><br>For&nbsp; the reasons hereinbefore stated, we are of the opinion,&nbsp; and so&nbsp; hold, that the judgment&nbsp; of the&nbsp; trial court, appealed from by&nbsp; both parties, should&nbsp; be&nbsp; reversed,&nbsp; and that we should, and do hereby, absolve the defendants of the complaint upon which this action was instituted, without any special order&nbsp; as to&nbsp; the&nbsp; costs of both&nbsp; instances.

He was understood to be single.&nbsp; He alleged that fact&nbsp; in a public document and added to that allegation the solemnity of his oath.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was taught the tenets of the Catholic faith and entered the fold of its church a&nbsp; ceremony which required the better part of two years.&nbsp; The espousals were made, the banns published, and the marriage publicly solemnized.&nbsp;&nbsp; For more than&nbsp; half a century no one appeared to question its legality or attack its validity.&nbsp;&nbsp; Death had stilled the lips of the husband for more than eleven years, and the wife,&nbsp; enfeebled in mind and body, was on the very verge of the grave, so near in fact that she died before this action was tried, when the attack was made upon it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even then the assault was not made by the alleged wife in&nbsp; China, nor by her children.&nbsp; They&nbsp; lived for&nbsp; nearly forty years wholly apart from the alleged husband and father, and died, mother and children, without having asserted, during all that time, their&nbsp; rights before the world.&nbsp; It remained for the second generation, the grandchildren of the Chinese&nbsp; wife, those whom Sy&nbsp; Hien brought from&nbsp; China to this country,&nbsp; to resuscitate and revive an alleged relationship which had lain dormant for more than fifty years.<br><br>Again, I&nbsp; ask, what kind&nbsp; of evidence must public policy, indeed, public necessity require before it will permit that the marriage be held established?<br><blockquote>"Every intendment of the law leans to matrimony. When a marriage&nbsp; has been shown in evidence, whether regular or irregular, and&nbsp; whatever the form of the proofs, the law raises a strong presumption of its legality - not only casting the burden&nbsp; of proof on the party objecting, but requiring him throughout, in every particular, to make plain, against the constant pressure of this presumption, the truth of law and fact that it is illegal and void.&nbsp; So that this issue can not be tried like the ordinary ones, which are independent of this special presumption.&nbsp; And the strength of the presumption increases with the&nbsp; lapse of time through which the parties are&nbsp; cohabiting as husband and wife.&nbsp; It being for the highest&nbsp; good of the parties,&nbsp; of the children, and of the community, that all intercourse&nbsp; between the sexes in form matrimonial should be such in fact, the law, when administered by enlightened judges, seizes&nbsp; upon all probabilities, and presses into its service all things else which can help&nbsp; it, in each particular case, to sustain the marriage, and repel the conclusion&nbsp; of&nbsp; unlawful commerce.&nbsp; This doctrine explains why,&nbsp; as between the two&nbsp; presumptions of innocence and life, the law prefers the one which makes the marriage good.&nbsp; It extends through the entire law of marriage, and casts&nbsp; its weight beneficially into&nbsp; the balance&nbsp; when other considerations are&nbsp; conflicting, or their effect&nbsp; is doubtful. Persons dwelling together in apparent matrimony are&nbsp; presumed, in the absence of any counterpresumption or evidence special to the case, to be in fact married.&nbsp; The reason is that such is the common order of society, and that if the parties&nbsp; were not what they thus hold themselves out&nbsp; as being, they would&nbsp; be&nbsp; living in the&nbsp; constant violation&nbsp; of decency and of law.&nbsp; And because marriage is the highest public interest, this presumption' is stronger and less easily overthrown than the other and ordinary presumptions of fact.&nbsp;&nbsp; If a ceremony of marriage appears in evidence, it is presumed to have been rightly performed, and to have been preceded by&nbsp; all the needful preliminaries.&nbsp; <i>If one of the 'parties had before been married,&nbsp; there is notv a presumption of great strength that the partner in such former marriage is dead.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet if such partner is shoivn to have been living shortly before this second&nbsp; marriage transpired, the presumption of life will be in conflict with that of the validity of the marriage, whereupon all the&nbsp; circumstances should be made to appear, and the fact&nbsp; be deduced from the entire evidence&nbsp; as operated upon by these rules.&nbsp; </i> An absence of the standard period of seven years will not now be required to make the second marriage good, because the seven-years presumption of life is weakened&nbsp; or overcome by that of the validity of the second marriage."&nbsp; (Bishop, Marriage, Divorce and Separation, vol. 1, sees. 956, 958, 959.)<br><br>"The law always&nbsp; presumes against the&nbsp; commission&nbsp; of crime, and therefore, where a woman, twelve months after her first husband was last heard of, married a second husband, and&nbsp; had children by&nbsp; him, the&nbsp; sessions did right in presuming,<i> prima facie</i>, that the first husband was&nbsp; dead at the time of the second marriage; and that it was incumbent on the party objecting to the second marriage&nbsp; to give some&nbsp; proof that the first&nbsp; husband was then alive."&nbsp;&nbsp; (The King&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> The Inhabitants of Twining, 2 B. &amp; Aid., 386.)<br><br>"As against the duly proved marriage&nbsp; of Patrick&nbsp; Larkin and Cephalia&nbsp; P. Bartlett, November&nbsp; 20, 1860,&nbsp; it was not enough for the defendant to prove that Patrick was married seventeen&nbsp; years before to Mary O'Neill.&nbsp; Proof of&nbsp; such previous marriage did not&nbsp; cast the burden upon the plaintiff of proving either&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; former&nbsp; wife was dead, or, if living, that a legal divorce had been granted.&nbsp; One of the plaintiff's claims, in reply to the defendant's claim of title by prescription, was, that on the 20th of November, 1860, she was,&nbsp; and ever since had been, a&nbsp; married woman, the wife of said Patrick, who died December 31, 1882.&nbsp;&nbsp; She proved the marriage by competent evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp; Being proved, the law raises a presumption in favor of its legality, upon which she had a right to rely until its illegality was proved. <i>Semper praesumitur pro matrimonio. </i> In the case at bar then, as it was presented to the court, there was no occasion for the plaintiff to prove the divorce, and it mattered not to the defendant that the Irish copy of marriage record was excluded, inasmuch as there was&nbsp; no offer on the part of the defendant to prove, in connection with proof of the first marriage and that the first wife was living at the date of the second&nbsp; marriage, that no divorce had ever dissolved her marriage with Patrick Larkin, all of which steps were necessary in order to overthrow the presumption of law in favor of the marriage of Patrick and&nbsp; Cephalia."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Erwin&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> English, 61 Conn., 509.)<br><br>"Where a person has&nbsp; departed from the&nbsp; State, and has not since been heard from,&nbsp; the presumption of the law is that he is alive, until the lapse&nbsp; of five years, and after that time, that he is dead.&nbsp; But&nbsp; the presumption of life within the five years is not sufficient to establish, the illegality of a second&nbsp; marriage of such person's wife within that time; for that would be to establish a crime by mere presumption of law; and especially&nbsp; ought&nbsp; the second marriage&nbsp; to be deemed legal when it is attacked after the lapse of twenty years and during all that time the party has not been heard from."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Spears <i>vs.</i> Burton, 31 Miss., 547.)<br><br>"When&nbsp; a marriage&nbsp; has been solemnized according to the forms&nbsp; of law every presumption&nbsp; will&nbsp; be indulged in favor of&nbsp; its validity.&nbsp; The presumption is one in favor of innocence, as it will be presumed that a man will not commit the crime of bigamy by marrying a second&nbsp; time&nbsp; while his first wife is living.&nbsp; (Johnson&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Johnson, 114 Ill., 611.) Absence of seven years without being heard from creates the presumption of death.&nbsp; But the presumption in&nbsp; favor of the validity of marriage is so strong that a former husband or wife will be presumed to be dead after an absence of less than seven&nbsp; years.&nbsp; The ordinary presumption&nbsp; in favor of the continuance of human life is made to give way to the presumption&nbsp; in favor of the innocence&nbsp; of a second marriage.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Yates <i>vs</i>. Houston, 3 Tex., 433;&nbsp; Johnson <i>vs.</i> Johnson,&nbsp; <i><i>supra</i></i>.)&nbsp; In the present case, however, no&nbsp; presumption as to the death of Barbara Beatrie can be indulged in favor&nbsp; of the validity&nbsp; of&nbsp; the marriage with&nbsp; Margaret Hube, because the proof shows affirmatively that aaid Barbara was alive when said&nbsp; marriage took place, and for nine years thereafter.&nbsp; The two marriages of Nicholas Beatrie, jr., and the existence of&nbsp; the first wife at the&nbsp; time of the second marriage, being established by proof, the presumption would&nbsp; arise in favor of a divorce&nbsp; from his first wife in order to sustain the second marriage.&nbsp;&nbsp; In view of&nbsp; this presumption the burden of proof rested upon the appellants, as the objecting parties,&nbsp; to show that there had been no divorce.&nbsp;&nbsp; The law is&nbsp; so positive in requiring a party, who asserts the&nbsp; illegality of a marriage, to take the burden of proving it, that such requirement is enforced even though it involves the proving of a negative.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Boulden <i>vs</i>.&nbsp; McIntire, 119 Ind., 574.)"&nbsp;&nbsp; (Schmisseur vs.&nbsp; Beatrie, 147 111., 210;&nbsp; Dixon <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; People, 18 Mich., 84; Hull <i>vs.</i> Rawls, 27 Miss., 471;&nbsp; Harris <i>vs</i>.

Davis in 1878; that&nbsp; the parties lived together&nbsp; as husband and wife until the death&nbsp; of Davis, in the year&nbsp; 1889, being recognized by the entire community to be husband and wife during that entire time.&nbsp; If presumptions are to&nbsp; be indulged in, is it not clear that these facts would demand the presumption to be that at the date of the death of Davis&nbsp; the defendant was his wife?&nbsp; To&nbsp; overcome the conclusion inevitable from these facts, the government asserts that during all this period Davis had&nbsp; a lawful&nbsp; wife&nbsp; living.&nbsp;&nbsp; It proves the bare fact that a marriage ceremony&nbsp; was had between Davis and Eliza Jane Callahan, and then asks the court, as the trior of the facts, to assume as a fact that the prior marriage was legal, without offering any evidence to show that the parties who entered into this ceremony were legally competent to&nbsp; contract in marriage.&nbsp;&nbsp; It may very well be that this prior marriage was legal and binding.&nbsp; It may be that it was not.&nbsp;&nbsp; The validity of the marriage between Davis and the defendant has never been denied by anyone,&nbsp; until the government chose&nbsp; to&nbsp; question&nbsp; it&nbsp; by bringing this suit. Under the peculiar&nbsp; facts of this case, the court, as the trior of the facts, is justified in demanding clear proof of&nbsp; the validity&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; alleged prior marriage which is relied on to&nbsp; defeat the claim of the defendant to be the lawful widow of Levi B. Davis, and, in the judgment of the court, the evidence adduced does not prove the validity of the prior marriage, but leaves that question&nbsp; uncertain; and, as the burden of proof is upon the government, it must be held that it has failed to adduce sufficient evidence to justify the&nbsp; finding that the defendant&nbsp; is not the lawful widow of Levi B. Davis, deceased."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Shiras, J., in U. S. <i>vs.</i> Green, 98 Fed., 63.)<br><br>"It is conceded by counsel for appellants that Orica Leach was at one time the lawfully wedded wife of T. H. Leach, but they insist that under the facts of this case the presumption arises that&nbsp; these&nbsp; parties were divorced.&nbsp; It appeared from the testimony that after the second marriage, which was in 1838, T. H. Leach and Orinda&nbsp; Leach lived in the town where Orica Leach was living, until T, H. Leach left for the West, and that Orica never made any&nbsp; claim that T. H. Leach was her husband.&nbsp;&nbsp; Orica was introduced to the second Mrs. Leach, but nothing was said about her relations to T. H. Leach.&nbsp;&nbsp; Children were born as a&nbsp; result of this second marriage and they were recognized&nbsp; as legitimate by the first wife.&nbsp; Emma Leach, a child of the second marriage, was introduced to the first wife, and they frequently met thereafter.&nbsp; At&nbsp; the time of the&nbsp; second marriage Leach claimed to have been divorced from his first wife; but there is no testimony in the record, other than presumption, as to a divorce having been granted.&nbsp; Neither is there any direct testimony tending to show that Orica Leach did not obtain a divorce, except the presumption&nbsp; that the marriage relation once shown is presumed to continue.&nbsp; We think these facts bring&nbsp; the case within the rule announced in the case of Blanchard <i>vs.</i> Lambert (43 Iowa, 228).&nbsp; The&nbsp; law presumes that this second marriage was lawful, and not criminal, and that either Leach or his first wife had obtained a divorce before the second marriage.&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no testimony whatever to meet the presumption of divorce; no showing that the parties to the first marriage were not divorced.

We think, where the facts are not such as to destroy such a presumption,&nbsp; that a dissolution of&nbsp; the first&nbsp; marriage,&nbsp; by divorce,&nbsp; will be&nbsp; presumed in favor of the validity of the second marriage."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Boulden <i>vs.</i> Mclntire, 119 Ind., 574.)<br><br>"In an action to annul a marriage on the ground of the previous marriage of the woman to another husband, who has not been heard of for four and a half years at the time of the second marriage, in the absence of proof that the first husband was then living, or had not been divorced from the defendant, the presumption in favor of the innocence of the defendant from crime or wrong and of the legality of the second marriage will prevail over the presumption of continuance of life of the first husband; and the burden is cast upon the party asserting her guilt or immorality to prove that the first marriage was&nbsp; not ended&nbsp; by death or divorce before the second marriage."&nbsp; (Hunter<i> vs</i>.

If Desgrange could overthrow his marriage with&nbsp; Zulime by confession&nbsp; at one time, so he could at any other time; on this assumption, his&nbsp; confession of&nbsp; a previous&nbsp; marriage could have been admitted at any time before the trial, or at the trial,&nbsp; when&nbsp; he stood by and might&nbsp; be examined&nbsp; as&nbsp; a witness. The great basis of human society throughout the civilized world is founded on&nbsp; marriages&nbsp; and legitimate offspring; and to hold that either of the parties could, by&nbsp; a mere declaration, establish the fact&nbsp; that&nbsp; a marriage was void, would be an alarming doctrine."&nbsp; (Games <i>vs</i>. Relf, 53 U. S., 533.)</blockquote>Whether we fully&nbsp; accept the doctrine above laid down or not, we are nevertheless forced to&nbsp; the conclusion that the evidence adduced by the plaintiffs relative to the marriage in China should be "clear, strong,&nbsp; and convincing" before the court holds such marriage proved.&nbsp; Under the&nbsp; circumstances of this case every presumption should be in favor of sustaining the second marriage, even to the extent&nbsp; of holding that the marriage, if any, between Sy Quia and&nbsp; Yap Puan Niu had been dissolved by divorce when the second marriage occurred.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the stern demands of public policy which&nbsp; imperatively require that families born and reared in this country who by industry and frugality have amassed a competency from the utilization of its resources and opportunities shall not be despoiled of&nbsp; the fruits of a lifetime except upon clear, strong, and convincing proof, we have laid&nbsp; upon us no less&nbsp; imperatively the&nbsp; injunction that a marriage concededly solemnized in&nbsp; accordance&nbsp; with the forms&nbsp; of religion and of&nbsp; law shall&nbsp; not be&nbsp; annulled&nbsp; and destroyed for light and transient causes, but shall be presumed to be valid and binding&nbsp; upon participants and society&nbsp; until&nbsp; its nullity shall have been&nbsp; demonstrated by&nbsp; clear, strong, and convincing proof.<br><br>In&nbsp; weighing such evidence we must bear in mind the following:<br></y><ol><li><y additional="" one="" presented="" them,="" notwithstanding="" objection="" counsel="" for ="" plaintiffs,="" by="" an="" dated="" april="" 4, ="" 1908,="" certified="" supplementary="" exceptions;="" considering="" appointment="" of ="" gregorio="" sy="" quia="" receiver="" made="" suggestion="" open ="" court, ="" at="" which="" time="" amount="" bond="" fixed="" knowledge="" defendants,="" also="" directing="" a ="" statement="" property="" received="" by ="" the ="" defendants="" submitted="" within="" a="" specified ="" time, ="" ordered="" that="" execution="" judgment ="" be="" not="" stayed="" so="" far ="" as="" latter ="" order="" concerned,="" original="" bill="" exceptions,="" together ="" sup ="" plementary ="" one, ="" was="" duly="" forwarded="" to="" clerk ="" of="" this="" court="" in="" connection="" with="" the="" appeal="" taken="" and="" allowed.="">The marriage is alleged to have occurred at Am Thou, a small interior town of China, more than a thousand miles from&nbsp; the home of the defendants, among a people whose language was wholly unknown to the defendants.&nbsp; It was substantially impossible&nbsp; for them&nbsp; to obtain in China any evidence in opposition to that produced by the plaintiffs.

Rep., 956), Coxe, C. J., said, page 959:<br><blockquote>"In approaching the defense of prior use the rule of evidence applicable thereto should constantly be borne in mind. The defense must be established beyond a reasonable doubt. The reason for the rule is obvious.&nbsp; It is so easy to fabricate or color testimony which&nbsp; lies almost wholly in the control of the person producing&nbsp; it, the infirmities of the human memory are&nbsp; so great and the liability&nbsp; to mistake&nbsp; so manifest, that the court is never justified in permitting such testimony to outweigh the presumption of validity which attaches to the patent unless it be of such a character as to carry a clear&nbsp; conviction and remove every reasonable&nbsp; doubt.&nbsp; This court has&nbsp; frequently had occasion to consider this defense, and it is,&nbsp; therefore, unnecessary to repeat what has been often <i> said heretofore."&nbsp; (Thayer <i>vs.</i> Hart, 20 Fed., 693; Mack </i>vs. Spencer, 52 Fed., 819; Lalance Co. <i>vs</i>.

with all its force and in all&nbsp; its extent to the case at bar, it nevertheless is clear to me that a rule of somewhat similar character ought to be&nbsp; applied&nbsp; here.&nbsp; As to result,&nbsp; it matters not whether we say that in all civil cases more than a preponderance of the&nbsp; proof is never required to establish a cause of action, and&nbsp; then permit the&nbsp; special circumstances&nbsp; to weigh in arriving at the preponderance of the&nbsp; proof, or whether we hold that&nbsp; the general rule of preponderance in civil cases is changed by exceptional or special conditions.&nbsp; The end is the same.&nbsp; In my judgment there are most assuredly&nbsp; conditions and&nbsp; circumstances in the case before&nbsp; us which&nbsp; require that&nbsp; the testimony&nbsp; presented&nbsp; by&nbsp; the plaintiffs shall be scrutinized and weighed with&nbsp;

Crossfield,&nbsp; who tried&nbsp; the&nbsp; case and&nbsp; saw and&nbsp; heard the&nbsp; witnesses, in&nbsp; his very carefully&nbsp; prepared opinion, found the following facts to be fully proved:<br><br>First. That one Sy Quia, a Chinaman, was born in the Empire of China, in or near the city of Amoy, in 1822 or 1823.<br><br>Second. That&nbsp; when the said Sy Quia was about 12 years of age he came to the Philippine Islands and remained here until he was about 25 years of age.<br><br>Third. That in the year 1847 he returned to China&nbsp; where he was married to&nbsp; one Yap&nbsp; Buanju&nbsp; (Yap&nbsp; Pua&nbsp; Niu), a Chinese woman, in accordance with the&nbsp; laws and customs of the Chinese Empire.<br><br>Fourth. That&nbsp; Sy Quia and Yap Buanju&nbsp; lived&nbsp; together from 1847 to 1851 or 1852; that during this&nbsp; period&nbsp; two children were born of that marriage&nbsp; and were called&nbsp; respectively, Sy Bibo and Sy Biguel.<br><br>Fifth. That about 1870 the said&nbsp; Sy Bibo was&nbsp; lawfully married to Ho Gim Niu, a Chinese woman, and there were born to them two children,&nbsp; one of which died&nbsp; in&nbsp; infancy, and&nbsp; the other,&nbsp; named Sy Jui Niu, one&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiffs in the present case, died after&nbsp; the&nbsp; commencement of the present action, leaving an only child named Sian Han, a minor, now represented in the present case by his guardian, C.&nbsp; W. O'Brien; that when&nbsp; the first&nbsp; child&nbsp; of the said&nbsp; Sy Bibo died&nbsp; in&nbsp; infancy&nbsp; he&nbsp; adopted&nbsp; in&nbsp; accordance&nbsp; with the laws and customs of China, a Chinese child named Sy Joe Chay,&nbsp; one&nbsp; of&nbsp; the plaintiffs&nbsp; in&nbsp; the present case.&nbsp; Sy Bibo died in China in&nbsp; 1882.<br><br>Sixth. That said Sy Biguel,&nbsp; on or&nbsp; about the year 1871, was lawfully married in China to a Chinese woman named Yap Su Niu,&nbsp; from which marriage there&nbsp; were born two children, named,&nbsp; respectively, Sy Joe Lieng and Sy&nbsp; Chuaniu, who are each plaintiffs in&nbsp; the present action.&nbsp; Sy Biguel died in China in&nbsp; or about the year 1880, leaving his two above-named children as his only heirs.<br><br>It will be seen, therefore, that each of the plaintiffs included in the&nbsp; title of this cause is a direct descendant of the said Sy Quia and his&nbsp; Chinese wife, Yap&nbsp; Buanju.<br><br>Seventh. Yap Buanju, the Chinese wife of the said&nbsp; Sy Quia, died&nbsp; in China, intestate, in the year 1891.<br><br>Eighth.&nbsp; In the year 1851 or 1852 Sy Quia returned to the Philippine&nbsp; Islands where he&nbsp; became a member of the Catholic&nbsp; Church and adopted the name of Vicente Romero Sy Quia.<br><br>Ninth. In 1853 the&nbsp; said&nbsp; Sy Quia&nbsp; (Vicente Romero Sy Quia) was married, in accordance with the forms prescribed by the Roman Catholic Church, to the defendant, Petronila Encarnacion, who died in the year 1906, after the commencement of the present action, and her estate is now represented by Pedro Sy Quia, her son,&nbsp; as&nbsp; administrator.<br><br>Tenth. The said Sy Quia (Vicente Romero Sy Quia) died intestate in the city of Manila, in the year 1894.<br><br>Eleventh. After the&nbsp; marriage of the said Sy Quia (Vicente Romero Sy Quia) and Petronila Encarnacion, there were born&nbsp; to&nbsp; them five children, whose names,&nbsp; with the years of their birth, are as&nbsp; follows:<br><br>Apolinaria&nbsp; Sy&nbsp; Quia, 1853&nbsp;&nbsp; (who died,&nbsp; without&nbsp; being married, intestate, in May 1900, leaving her mother as her only heir.)<br><br>Maria Sy&nbsp; Quia, who died before the commencement of the present suit, leaving as her only heir surviving Generoso Mendoza Sy Quia, one of the defendants in the present action.<br><br>Gregorio Sy Quia, 1856, Pedro Sy Quia, 1858, and Juan Sy Quia, 1860.<br><br>It will be seen that the present defendants, Petronila Encarnacion&nbsp; (Pedro Sy Quia now being the administrator of her estate), Generoso Mendoza Sy Quia, Gregorio Sy Quia, and Pedro Sy Quia, on his own behalf and as administrator of the estate of Petronila Encarnacion, and&nbsp; Juan Sy Quia, are the direct descendants of the said Sy Quia (Vicente Romero Sy Quia) and Petronila Encarnacion.<br><br>Twelfth. After the death of Sy Quia (Vicente Romero Sy Quia) on the 9th day of January, 1894,&nbsp; his&nbsp; estate was duly administered by his Filipino wife, Petronila Encarnacion,&nbsp; and a final distribution of his estate was made by order of the court of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance of Manila,&nbsp; on the 3d day of August, 1900, among the defendants herein.<br><br>Thirteenth. That the said Sy Quia (Vicente Romero Sy Quia)&nbsp; during his married&nbsp; life had accumulated&nbsp; a large fortune,&nbsp; consisting of real&nbsp; and personal property,&nbsp; all of which was located in the Philippine Islands.<br><br>Fourteenth. That while there is some dispute upon the question&nbsp; as to the amount of&nbsp; property which the said Petronila Encarnacion brought&nbsp; to the marriage,&nbsp; we&nbsp; are of the opinion that&nbsp; the proof justifies&nbsp; the conclusion that at the time&nbsp; of the marriage of the said Sy Quia and Petronila Encarnacion, they each brought&nbsp; to the marriage relation property&nbsp; of about the same value.<br><br>Fifteenth.&nbsp; That each of the marriages of&nbsp; the said Sy Quia, the first&nbsp; in China in 1847&nbsp; to the said Yap Buanju, and&nbsp; the&nbsp; second in the&nbsp; Philippine Islands in&nbsp; 1853&nbsp; to the said Petronila Encarnacion, was made in accordance with the laws&nbsp; and customs of the respective countries in which the marriage ceremonies were performed.<br><br>Sixteenth.&nbsp; There&nbsp; is nothing in the record which shows or tends&nbsp; to show that each of said marriages, so&nbsp; far as the two women were concerned, was not made in absolute good faith, believing that they had a&nbsp; right to enter into the said marriage relation, and that there was no impediment in law&nbsp; against it.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is&nbsp; nothing in the record which shows or tends to show that&nbsp; Petronila Encarnacion did not enter into the marriage relation in good faith, believing&nbsp; that there was nothing in law,&nbsp; at least, which forbade&nbsp; it.<br><br>Seventeenth. We have, therefore,&nbsp; in&nbsp; brief, the following facts:<br><br>(<i>a</i>) That Sy Quia (Vicente Romero Sy Quia)&nbsp; and his Chinese wife, Yap Buanju, were married according to the laws&nbsp; and customs of China in 1847, and that the present plaintiffs are the direct descendants&nbsp; of that marriage.<br><br>(<i>b</i>) That Sy Quia (Vicente Romero Sy&nbsp; Quia)&nbsp; and&nbsp; Petronila&nbsp; Encarnacion were married in&nbsp; 1853,&nbsp; in&nbsp; accordance with&nbsp; the laws and customs of the Philippine Islands, and that the defendants&nbsp; in the present case are&nbsp; the direct descendants of that marriage.<br><br>(<i>c</i>) That the marriage of&nbsp; the&nbsp; said&nbsp; Sy Quia with Yap Buanju had not been dissolved or annulled at the time of the marriage of Sy Quia with Petronila Encarnacion.<br><br>(<i>d</i>) That so far as Petronila Encarnacion was concerned her marriage was entered into in absolute good faith.<br><br>Basing his conclusions upon the foregoing facts, the Hon. A. S.&nbsp; Crossfield rendered a decision as follows:<br><br><i>(a) Giving to the children of Vicente Romero Sy Quia by his first wife, Yap Pua Niu, one-half of the said estate; and<br><br>(b) Giving to the&nbsp; children of his second wife, Petronila Encarnacion, the&nbsp; other half of the said estate.</i> From&nbsp; this decision the plaintiffs and defendants each appealed and each presented a bill of exceptions.<br><br><i>The plaintiffs and appellants agree to&nbsp; the findings of fact made&nbsp; by the lower court and present&nbsp; only a question of law in their&nbsp; appeal.&nbsp; The contention&nbsp; of the plaintiffs&nbsp; is that they are entitled to all of the estate of Vicente Romero Sy Quia,&nbsp; under the law.</i><br><br>The defendants and appellants each excepted to the judgment of the lower court and each presented a motion for a new trial, based upon the ground that the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause did not justify the findings of fact made by the lower court, which motion the court denied; to which order of the lower court the defendants duly excepted.<br><br>The contention of the defendants and&nbsp; appellants is:<br><br>First.&nbsp; That the findings of fact made by the lower court are not supported by the evidence; and<br><br>Second. That under the evidence they are entitled to all of the estate of Vicente Romero Sy Quia.<br><br>The lower court, in speaking of the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause, said: <i>"There is practically no conflict in the evidence received, except such as possibly may be drawn from inference, and&nbsp; I find the following facts undoubtedly established:" </i> [The findings are set out above.]<br><br>The appeals&nbsp; brought to this court present both a question of fact and of law.<br><br>The plaintiffs&nbsp; and appellants, under&nbsp; their appeal,&nbsp; are not entitled to have the evidence examined.&nbsp; (See par. 2, sec,&nbsp; 1, Act No. 1596, Philippine&nbsp; Commission.)&nbsp; They made no motion for a new trial in the court below.<br><br>The defendants, by virtue of their having made a motion for a new trial based upon the ground&nbsp; that the&nbsp; evidence was insufficient to justify the decision, and having excepted to the order of the court thereon, are entitled to have the evidence examined in this court.&nbsp; This court, however, while it may review the evidence taken in the court below, can not affirm or reverse except:<br><br>(<i>a</i>) By giving due weight to the fact that the judge who tried the case saw the witnesses&nbsp; when they testified; and<br><br>(<i>b</i>) When there is a preponderance of evidence against the findings of the lower court.&nbsp; (See sec. 1, Act No. 1596, Philippine Commission.)<br><br><i>Our contention, taking into consideration the fact that the lower court saw and heard the witnesses, is that his findings of fact are supported by a clear preponderance of the&nbsp; evidence and that his judgment, based upon such facts, is clearly supported by the lato as well as by sound reason and justice.</i><br><br>The majority opinion finds that Sy Quia and Yap Pua Niu were not married in China, as is alleged by the plaintiffs for the reasons:<br><br>First. That his&nbsp; children and grandchildren,&nbsp; after the lapse of about fifty-eight years,&nbsp; could not present&nbsp; the letters which passed between the father of Sy Quia and the father of his&nbsp; wife&nbsp; Yap Pua Niu, before&nbsp; the marriage, by which these parents arranged for the said marriage, without&nbsp; the consent of the contracting&nbsp; parties, which&nbsp; letters they (the contracting parties)&nbsp; never had in their possession and&nbsp; never saw; and<br><br>Second. Because&nbsp; when Sy Quia in the Philippine Islands was&nbsp; trying to practice a fraud upon his Chinese wife and his to be second Filipino wife, he then said that he was not married.<br><br>All of the Chinese children of Sy Quia, born of his Chinese wife, were born in China between the years of 1847 and 1852, and those who were living at the time of the trial were between&nbsp; fifty-three&nbsp; and fifty-eight&nbsp; years of age.&nbsp; As&nbsp; a practical&nbsp; question,&nbsp; how many&nbsp; men&nbsp; of the most civilized nations,&nbsp; who&nbsp; have&nbsp; reached the&nbsp; age of fifty years, could then&nbsp; prove&nbsp; by documentary evidence, in the absence of public record, the&nbsp; marriage of their parents? I&nbsp; doubt whether there is a single member of this present court who would&nbsp; be&nbsp; able to&nbsp; prove by documentary evidence the marriage of&nbsp; his parents.&nbsp; The assertion is ventured that not a single member of the Supreme Court of the United States, the recognized greatest judicial body, would be able to prove by documentary proof, outside of public&nbsp; records, that his parents were legally married.<br><br>There is no&nbsp; proof in the record that the Chinese Government had a system of&nbsp; public&nbsp; records&nbsp; of&nbsp; marriage at the time of the marriage of Sy Quia with his first wife Yap Pua Niu, or that they have any such system now.<br><br><i>Sy Quia could not, by any representation of his made at the time or before&nbsp; his&nbsp; second marriage in the&nbsp; Philippine Islands, change the fact of his first marriage in China for the purpose&nbsp; of&nbsp; defeating the legitimacy&nbsp; of&nbsp; his&nbsp; children born of his Chinese wife. </i><br><br>The evidence&nbsp; adduced by the plaintiffs relating to the marriage of Sy Quia in China is literally as follows:<br><br>Sy Peng testified as follows:<br><blockquote>"Q.

What are the rights of the respective wives in the estate of the said Sy Quia, he having died intestate?<br><br>Third.&nbsp; What are the rights of the children of the respective marriages in&nbsp; the estate of the said Sy Quia,&nbsp; he having died intestate?<br><br>Bigamy and polygamy&nbsp; were&nbsp; both expressly prohibited under the Laws of the Indies, as well as by the rules of the Holy&nbsp; Roman Catholic&nbsp; Church. <i> No&nbsp; rule was better established than&nbsp; that which made a second marriage null which&nbsp; was entered into before&nbsp; the dissolution&nbsp; or annulment of a preceding one.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was&nbsp; the&nbsp; rule under the civil as well&nbsp; as under the common law.</i>&nbsp; By the common law, if a person having a husband or wife, married another person, such&nbsp; second marriage was absolutely null and void. (Dalrymple <i>vs</i>. Dalrymple (1811),&nbsp; 2 Hagg.

Smith, 1 Tex.,&nbsp; 621;&nbsp; 46 Am.&nbsp; Dec, 121.)<br><br>Under the civil law this rule, making the second marriage, during the existence of the first, absolutely null and void, was&nbsp; also&nbsp; early&nbsp; modified&nbsp; (law&nbsp; 1,&nbsp; title&nbsp; 13,&nbsp; Partida&nbsp; 4). Civilians&nbsp; recognized the&nbsp; hardship&nbsp; resulting&nbsp; to&nbsp; children born of the second marriage and&nbsp; provided a remedy earlier than&nbsp; those who were subject to&nbsp; the common law.&nbsp; While law 1, title 13 of the fourth <i>Partida </i>does not expressly make the second marriage valid, when one or both of the parties entered into the&nbsp; same in good faith, believing&nbsp; that there existed no impediment, yet this is the effect of the law,&nbsp; for the reason that it expressly makes the&nbsp; issue of such marriage legitimate, which, of course, could not be done except upon&nbsp; the theory&nbsp; that&nbsp; the marriage&nbsp; itself was legitimate and legal.&nbsp; This provision of the <i>Partidas</i> does not, however, allow the legality&nbsp; of such manage to exist nor the legitimacy of the children, except&nbsp; up to the time&nbsp; when the innocent spouse has knowledge that the marriage is&nbsp; illegal.&nbsp; From that time the&nbsp; marriage is&nbsp; regarded as an illegal marriage and children which are born after that time are illegitimate. Law 1,&nbsp; title 13, <i>Partida</i> 4, is as follows:<br><blockquote>"By a legitimate child is meant he who is begotten according to law; and&nbsp; they are&nbsp; called&nbsp; legitimate&nbsp; who are&nbsp; born of a father and mother who are really married according to the ordinances of Holy Church.&nbsp; And&nbsp; although&nbsp; it should happen, that between those who were married&nbsp; openly and publicly in the Church, there should exist any impediment for which the marriage&nbsp; ought to&nbsp; be&nbsp; dissolved,&nbsp; yet&nbsp; the children they&nbsp; beget&nbsp; (<i>fiziessen)</i>&nbsp; before they&nbsp; know of&nbsp; such impediment, will&nbsp; be legitimate.&nbsp; And so&nbsp; it would be,&nbsp; as well where both&nbsp; of the spouses were ignorant of the existence of the impediment, as when one&nbsp; only of them knew it; for the ignorance of one of the spouses alone, would render the children legitimate.&nbsp;&nbsp; But if after they knew with certainty&nbsp; of the existence of such impediment,&nbsp; they should beget children, those that they afterwards have, will not be legitimate.&nbsp; Yet if during the existence of such impediment, and while both or one of them was ignorant of it, they should be accused before&nbsp; the judges of the Holy Church and before the impediment was&nbsp; proved or the sentence&nbsp; pronounced, they should have&nbsp; children,&nbsp; those that they beget (<i>fiziessen</i>) during the&nbsp; existence of the doubt, will all be legitimate.&nbsp; And so the children a man has by his&nbsp; concubine&nbsp; (<i>barragana</i>) will be legitimate, if he afterwards marry her.&nbsp; For although&nbsp; they&nbsp; are&nbsp; not legitimate when they are born, yet so great is&nbsp; the force of matrimony, that they become legitimate immediately their father and mother are married.&nbsp; And so ft woujd&nbsp; be, if a man have a&nbsp; child by his slave, and&nbsp; he afterwards marry her.&nbsp;&nbsp; For marriage has so great an&nbsp; effect;&nbsp; that as soon as it is contracted, the mother becomes free,&nbsp; and the children legitimate."</blockquote><i>The above-quoted provision of the Partidas is a very just and humane provision of law.&nbsp; It justly protects those who have innocently entered into the solemn relation of marriage, and their descendants.</i>&nbsp; The good faith of the parties will be presumed until the contrary is shown&nbsp; or proved.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Art. 69, Civil Code (Spanish); <i>Las Leyes&nbsp; de Matr'inonio</i>, sec. 96; Gaines<i> vs. </i>Hennen, 65 U. S. 553.)<br><br><i>There is nothing in the&nbsp; record which&nbsp; shows or tends to show that the respective wives had entered into the marriage relation knowing or&nbsp; believing that there existed any impediment&nbsp; whatever.&nbsp;&nbsp; It must be&nbsp; concluded&nbsp; then that they acted in good faith,&nbsp; and for the purposes of participation in the&nbsp; estate of the&nbsp; husband, Sy Quia, the&nbsp; two marriages must be regarded as legitimate. </i> (Law 1, title 18, Partida 4; Escriche, vol.&nbsp; 2, p. 110, White's New Recopilation, vol. 1, p. 64.)<br><br><i>A woman who is deceived by a man who represents himself&nbsp; as single, and who marries him, she and her children born while the deception lasted, under the Spanish law, are entitled to all the rights of a legitimate wife and children.</i> These rights are provided for in the&nbsp; Civil Code.<br><br>See also the following decisions: Dalrymple<i> vs.</i> Dalrymple (1811), 2 Hagg.&nbsp; Const.,&nbsp; 54, 55, 17 English Ruling Cases, 10;&nbsp; Clendenning <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Clendenning et al.&nbsp; (March,&nbsp; 1825), Martin's Reports (La.)&nbsp; vol. 7,&nbsp; p. 587; Patton&nbsp; et&nbsp; al.&nbsp; vs. Cities&nbsp; of Philadelphia and&nbsp; New&nbsp; Orleans&nbsp; (May, 1846), 1 La.

Rep., 202, 10 Columbia Law Review, 79.<br><br>The&nbsp; majority opinion cites section 1417 of the Civil Code in support of its conclusion that all of the property of Sy Quia belongs to the children of the second&nbsp; wife.&nbsp; Said&nbsp; section is&nbsp; as follows:<br><blockquote>"Art. 1417. The conjugal partnership expires on the&nbsp; dissolution of&nbsp; the&nbsp; marriage&nbsp; or when it&nbsp; is declared&nbsp; void.<br><br>"The spouse&nbsp; who, by reason&nbsp; of his or her bad faith, causes&nbsp; the annulment,&nbsp; shall not receive any share of&nbsp; the property of the partnership.<br><br>"The conjugal&nbsp; partnership shall also terminate in&nbsp; the cases mentioned in article 1433."</blockquote>Practically all of the&nbsp; provisions of the Civil Code now in force in the Philippine Islands existed prior to the adoption of the Civil Code in what are known as "The Laws of the Indies," "<i>Leyes de Toro," Novisima Recopilacion"</i> the <i>"Partidas</i>" and&nbsp; others. In other words, the&nbsp; Civil Code is nothing more or less, with a few modifications, than a codification of the separate decrees and&nbsp; royal acts applicable to the Philippine&nbsp; Islands.&nbsp; The Civil Code was not put&nbsp; in force in the Philippine Islands until on or about the month of December, 1889.&nbsp; Sy Quia was married to his first wife in 1847 and to&nbsp; his second&nbsp; wife&nbsp; in 1852 or 1853.&nbsp; If his second marriage was null and void, it was null and void in 1852&nbsp; or 1853, and the laws governing the effect of&nbsp; such nullity in force at that time must govern, which&nbsp; were "The Laws of the Indies" above quoted.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Law 1, title 13, <i>Partida</i> 4.)&nbsp;&nbsp; But even admitting that article&nbsp; 1417&nbsp; is the law applicable in cases where the marriage is null, we contend that it was&nbsp; not the&nbsp; intention of the&nbsp; legislature&nbsp; to&nbsp; apply said provision&nbsp; to a&nbsp; case like the present.&nbsp;&nbsp; We&nbsp; do not believe that it was the intention of the&nbsp; wise&nbsp; legislators of the Spanish Government, where a man&nbsp; having a legal wife and children marries another woman&nbsp; and has children by&nbsp; such other woman, that the effect of the&nbsp; second marriage was to turn over to the second wife and children all of the&nbsp; property belonging to him, to the prejudice of the first wife and legitimate children.&nbsp; Such an interpretation is&nbsp; nauseating to every sense of justice and right.&nbsp;&nbsp; We do not believe that it was the intention of the Spanish Government to enforce said article (1417)&nbsp; to the prejudice of&nbsp; a prior legal&nbsp; wife and legitimate children.&nbsp; To give article 1417 the interpretation which the majority opinion contends for is to deprive the first wife and the first children,&nbsp; who have committed no wrong&nbsp; whatever,&nbsp; of their legitimate&nbsp; participation&nbsp; in the property of their husband and father.<br><br>We believe that&nbsp; article 1417 is not applicable to a case where a man or&nbsp; a woman, having a legitimate wife&nbsp; or husband and children, marries a second&nbsp; wife or husband. We do not believe that it was the intention of the legislature to punish the first wife and children in the way indicated by said article.&nbsp; We do not believe that it is the intention of said article to take&nbsp; away from the legitimate wife and children property&nbsp; to which they are legally entitled&nbsp; and give it to a second wife and&nbsp; children, in&nbsp; the manner contended for&nbsp; in the majority opinion.&nbsp; There can be no objection to the interpretation given to article 1417 when the marriage is declared null and void, by reason of the provisions of the Civil Code,&nbsp; (Arts. 101, 102, and 103.)&nbsp;&nbsp; But even the cases mentioned in these articles do not contemplate the existence of a&nbsp; former wife and legitimate children.<br><br>The Civil Code contains no&nbsp; provisions for the division of property in a case like the present.&nbsp; We, therefore, insist that the law which is applicable to the present case is that provision of the Partidas which we have quoted above (law 1, title 13,&nbsp; Partida 4)&nbsp; and which is the&nbsp; provision&nbsp; of&nbsp; law followed by the&nbsp; Supreme Court&nbsp; of the United States and the other States above&nbsp; quoted.&nbsp;&nbsp; We believe that this provision&nbsp; affords an adequate, equitable, and&nbsp; just remedy, and one in consonance with&nbsp; sound reason and justice&nbsp; for a case like the present.&nbsp; Courts are frequently called upon to solve questions where there is no express provision of statutory law to assist&nbsp; them.&nbsp; We are&nbsp; fortunate,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; in&nbsp; the present complicated case, to find that the wise legislators of the Spanish&nbsp; Government, assisted always by the pure motives and high ideals&nbsp; of the Holy Roman Catholic Church, have made an express provision governing the present case. (Law 1, title 13, <i>Partida</i> 4.)<br><br>Suppose, for example, that Sy Quia had married his first wife in 1847 in one part of the Philippine Archipelago and as a result of said&nbsp; marriage there were born to&nbsp; them two children,&nbsp; and that&nbsp; after the birth of the two children Sy Quia had gone to some remote part of the Archipelago and had there married his second wife and had lived with her for a number of years and&nbsp; had had children and acquired property as&nbsp; he did in the present case.&nbsp; Would the courts, under&nbsp; these facts,&nbsp; have given all of the&nbsp; property&nbsp; to the second wife and children?&nbsp; So far as the present case is concerned, in our opinion, the mere fact that the first wife happened to live in China, instead of in the Philippine Islands, makes no difference in the solution of the problem. It is of no importance&nbsp; whatever whether he married his first&nbsp; wife in&nbsp; one part of&nbsp; the Archipelago or in a foreign country.&nbsp; (GaineS <i>vs.</i> Hennen, 65 U. S., 553; Hubbell <i>vs.</i> Inkstein, 7 La. An., 252; Germann<i> vs.</i> Tenneas, 39 La An., 1021.)<br><br>With&nbsp; reference to the second question, "What&nbsp; are the rights of the respective wives in the estate of the said Sy Quia, he having died intestate?" and having held that for the purposes&nbsp; of participation in the estate of the husband, they&nbsp; are each regarded&nbsp; as legitimate, it would seem to be a just and humane conclusion to hold that each wife in the present&nbsp; case&nbsp; should succeed to that interest&nbsp; in&nbsp; the estate of the husband to which&nbsp; she would be entitled were she the only legitimate wife.<br><br>There is no evidence that the Chinese wife brought&nbsp; any property whatever&nbsp; to the marriage relation.&nbsp; The&nbsp; proof showed&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; Filipino&nbsp; wife,&nbsp; Petronila&nbsp; Encarnacion, brought&nbsp; to the marriage relation about the same amount of property which&nbsp; the husband had at the time of their marriage.<br><br>Article 1392 of the Civil Code provides that "by virtue of the conjugal&nbsp; partnership, the earnings or&nbsp; profits indiscriminately obtained by either of&nbsp; the spouses during the marriage, shall belong to the husband and wife,&nbsp; share and share alike, upon&nbsp; the dissolution of the marriage,"<br><br>Article 1424 of the Civil Code provides that the&nbsp; amount of indebtedness&nbsp; against&nbsp; the respective spouses, chargeable to the conjugal partnership, shall first be deducted, and that then the&nbsp; remainder shall be divided.<br><br>Article 1426 of the Civil&nbsp; pode&nbsp; provides that "the&nbsp; net remainder of the partnership property <i>shall be divided, share and share alike, between the husband and wife, or their&nbsp; respective heirs."</i><br><br>From these provisions of the Civil Code, which were in force at&nbsp; the&nbsp; time of the&nbsp; settlement of the&nbsp; estate of&nbsp; the said Sy Quia, it would follow, having held that each of the wives was legitimate, for the purposes of sharing in&nbsp; the conjugal partnership property, that each would be entitled to one-half of the net estate of the said Sy Quia.&nbsp; No decisions of the supreme court of Spain have been found bearing upon this question.&nbsp;&nbsp; Several decisions, however, have been found in the&nbsp; decisions of the&nbsp; Supreme&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; the United States and of the supreme court of&nbsp; the&nbsp; State of Louisiana, as well as other States of the United States.&nbsp; The decisions&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Supreme Court of&nbsp; the&nbsp; United&nbsp; States and those of the State of Louisiana are especially&nbsp; applicable to the&nbsp; present case, for the reason that they deal with&nbsp; the Spanish codes.<br><br>The first case that we find is that of&nbsp; Clendenning <i> vs.</i> Clendenning et al. (March, 1825), 7 Martin's Reports (La.), 587.&nbsp; In that case a man had married two women and had had children by each of them.&nbsp; The question&nbsp; presented to the court was, What were the respective rights of the wives and thier respective children?&nbsp;&nbsp; The court said:<br><blockquote>"The defendants contend, that notwithstanding that&nbsp; the plaintiffs' father had had a&nbsp; lawful wife,&nbsp; at the time of&nbsp; the second marriage, as the woman he last married was in good faith, at the time of the marriage,&nbsp; and&nbsp; ever since,&nbsp; at least till after the birth of the last child she had&nbsp; by him, <i>her marriage has its&nbsp; civil effects, and she and her&nbsp; children,&nbsp; the present defendants, are&nbsp; entitled to al</i>l the advantages the law gives to a lawful wife and children.&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; There seems to be no dispute on the question of law.&nbsp; The woman, who was deceived by a&nbsp; man, who&nbsp; represented himself as single, and his children&nbsp; begot&nbsp; while the deception lasted, <i> are bona fide wife&nbsp; and&nbsp; children, and as such are entitled to all the rights of a legitimate wife and issue.</i>"</blockquote>The&nbsp; next case which we find is that of Patton et al. <i> vs.</i><br><br>The Cities of Philadelphia and New Orleans (May, 1846), (1 La. An., 98).&nbsp;&nbsp; The facts, as related&nbsp; by the judge who wrote the&nbsp; opinion in the&nbsp; case, are as follows:<br><br>In the year 1790 Abraham Morehouse married Abigail Young in the State of New&nbsp; York and had two children&nbsp; by her.&nbsp; He subsequently came to the Spanish colony of Louisiana, gave it to be understood that he was a widower, and in September, 1799, by an act passed by the commandant of Fort Miro, in the District of Ouachita, acting as a notary public,&nbsp; agreed&nbsp; to take as his wife Eleonore Hook.&nbsp;&nbsp; The commandant states in the act that it is passed before him in conformity&nbsp; with a custom sanctioned by the Government on account of the want of spiritual assistance, and that the marriage is to be solemnized before the church on the first opportunity.<br><br>At the time of the marriage Abraham Morehouse declared that he was&nbsp; the widower of Abigail Young.<br><br>During the trial at the cause it&nbsp; was insisted that the second marriage ceremony performed in Louisiana in September,&nbsp; 1799, was simply a contract <i>per verba de futuro.</i> The court held that the ceremony was followed by cohabitation and that a marriage <i>per verba de futuro cum copula </i>had all the&nbsp; legal&nbsp; effects of a&nbsp; marriage per verba de prsesenti. The court&nbsp; held further that&nbsp; it was&nbsp; the intention of the parties&nbsp; to make a marriage <i>per verba de prsesenti. </i><br><br>After the marriage with the second wife in 1799, Abraham Morehouse acquired&nbsp; large landed estates in&nbsp; the State of Louisiana. He died in 1813, his two wives being then alive.&nbsp; Many years&nbsp; after the death&nbsp; of&nbsp; Abraham Morehouse, one Stephen Girard acquired some&nbsp; of this&nbsp; land through the&nbsp; first wife, Abigail Young, and her sons, they representing&nbsp; themselves to be&nbsp; the only legitimate wife and children of the said Abraham Morehouse.&nbsp; Later the said Stephen Girard, who&nbsp; had acquired about 208,000 acres of land from the said Morehouse, by will, bequeathed to the city&nbsp; of&nbsp; New&nbsp; Orleans&nbsp; the&nbsp; undivided&nbsp; one-third of the said 208,000&nbsp; acres of&nbsp; land and the remaining two-thirds to the city of Philadelphia.<br><br>The plaintiffs in the case&nbsp; of Patton&nbsp; et al.&nbsp; claimed to be the only lawful heirs&nbsp; and&nbsp; representatives of the said Abraham Morehouse&nbsp; and brought&nbsp; an action against the defendants (the Cities of Philadelphia and New&nbsp; Orleans) to get possession of the said&nbsp; property obtained through the said Stephen Girard.&nbsp; The essential facts being as we have just stated, the supreme court of Louisiana discussed the following questions:<br><br>First.<i> Was the marriage of Abraham Morehouse to Eleonore Hook&nbsp; valid as a civil contract, under&nbsp; the laws in force in Louisiana at the time&nbsp; of&nbsp; its celebration, although that marriage&nbsp; was not&nbsp; afterwards solemnized&nbsp; before the Church?</i><br><br>Second. If the marriage was&nbsp; not&nbsp; valid, when&nbsp; did Eleonore Hook acquire such&nbsp; a knowledge of tyie previous marriage of her husband as&nbsp; to put an end to her good faith?<br><br>Third. While she&nbsp; continued&nbsp; in&nbsp; good faith,&nbsp; what right had each of the wives to the acquests and gains made by the husband?<br><br>It will be remembered that the commandant who solemnized the marriage ceremony between Morehouse and his second wife, stated to the parties that the marriage was to be solemnized before the church on the first opportunity. It was&nbsp; contended on the part of&nbsp; the defendants that the marriage never having been solemnized before the church, that there in fact never existed a marriage between Morehouse and his&nbsp; second&nbsp; wife.&nbsp; In other words, that it was a&nbsp; clandestine&nbsp; marriage&nbsp; (<i>clandestina matrwioni</i>a).&nbsp; The defendants&nbsp; further argued that under and&nbsp; by virtue&nbsp; of the provisions&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Council&nbsp; of&nbsp; Trent, which had been adopted in Spain by&nbsp; a&nbsp; <i>real cedula</i> of Philip II, on the 12th day of August, 1564, the marriage could not be considered a valid marriage.&nbsp; The court held, however,<i> that no proof had&nbsp; been presented&nbsp; showing that the provisions&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Council of&nbsp; Trent had ever been&nbsp; made applicable to&nbsp; the Territory of Louisiana. </i> The court admitted,&nbsp; for the purpose of argument, that the Kings of Spain intended that the adoption of the General Council of Trent should extend to all the countries&nbsp; which they might subsequently discover or acquire.&nbsp; <i>It has never&nbsp; been understood that when the King of Spain&nbsp; had&nbsp; adopted any ecclesiastical orders or laws that such laivs had the effect of annulling the civil laws in force at the time.</i><br><br>From the earliest periods of which we have any authentic&nbsp; history, there was a constant effort&nbsp; on the part of the Christian&nbsp; Church to bring about&nbsp; reforms in the method of entering into the marriage relation&nbsp; and to make it&nbsp; a most holy&nbsp; relation.&nbsp; Marriages by&nbsp; purchase, sale, and capture, concubinage, and&nbsp; polygamy&nbsp; were always&nbsp; abhorrent to the high&nbsp; ideals of the Christian&nbsp; Church.&nbsp; A study of the history of the growth of the marriage relation shows clearly that the Church believed that the marriage should be a holy&nbsp; sacrament,&nbsp; that&nbsp; the state in&nbsp; its civil functions was not capable of dealing with such a holy relation, and therefore the Christian Church, from&nbsp; the earliest period of its history, made a strenuous effort to have the entering into the&nbsp; marriage relation controlled absolutely by Church ordinances.&nbsp; As&nbsp; early as the year 325&nbsp; at Nice&nbsp; a general council&nbsp; of&nbsp; 318 bishops was convened for the purpose of considering reform in the matter of marriages.&nbsp; Again in the year 787 another council was called&nbsp; at Nice, composed of 350 bishops for the same purpose.&nbsp; Again at the Council of Winchester in the year 1076 it was resolved: "That no man give his&nbsp; daughter or kinswoman in marriage&nbsp; without the priest's benediction," and declared that "otherwise the marriage shall not be&nbsp; deemed legitimate, but as fornication." Twenty-six years&nbsp; later (1102)&nbsp; at the Council of London,&nbsp; an attempt&nbsp; was made to put&nbsp; a check upon all clandestine contracts of marriage.&nbsp;&nbsp; This council resolved that "promises of marriage&nbsp; made between a&nbsp; man&nbsp; and woman without witnesses are declared to be null, if either party deny them."<br><br>In the year 1175 the resolutions of the preceding councils were reinforced&nbsp; by the&nbsp; canons of&nbsp; Archbishop Richard, taken from the&nbsp; decrees of Pope Ormidas of the&nbsp; year&nbsp; 514, ordering that "no faithful man, of what&nbsp; degree soever, marry in private, but in public, by receiving the&nbsp; priest's benediction.&nbsp; If any priest&nbsp; be discovered to have married any in private, let him be suspended&nbsp; from his office&nbsp; for three&nbsp; years."<br><br>Later, in&nbsp; the&nbsp; year 1200, Archbishop&nbsp; Walter ordained that "no marriage be contracted without the banns thrice published in the&nbsp; church, nor&nbsp; between persons&nbsp; unknown, and no marriage not&nbsp; publicly solemnized in the face of&nbsp; the Church is to be&nbsp; allowed except&nbsp; by special&nbsp; authority&nbsp; of the bishop."<br><br>It was contended for many years that&nbsp; no marriage was valid unless it had been entered into by&nbsp; prescribed religious celebration.&nbsp; The&nbsp; efforts&nbsp; of the Church to control marriages to the end that it should be recognized as&nbsp; a holy sacrament and not a&nbsp; civil contract, were evidenced&nbsp; in each of the&nbsp; councils of Lateran (Letran).&nbsp; The last of the councils of Lateran (Letran) was held in the&nbsp; year 1215.&nbsp; This council resolved that&nbsp; all unblessed&nbsp; marriages were&nbsp; illegal. Notwithstanding the&nbsp; efforts of the Christian Church&nbsp; to make all marriages illegal which had not been celebrated under&nbsp; the rites of the Church, it was finally compelled to recognize, as valid, marriages which were celebrated without the intervention&nbsp; of priest.<br><br>The next&nbsp; general&nbsp; effort&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; part&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Christian Church to control the question of&nbsp; marriage and to make the relation more holy and&nbsp; sacred, was by the Council&nbsp; of Trent.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Council&nbsp; of Trent was&nbsp; the&nbsp; nineteenth ecumenical council of the Holy Catholic Church,&nbsp; held at&nbsp; Trent, an imperial free&nbsp; city, under a&nbsp; prince bishop, in the Province of Tyrol.&nbsp; The council was called by&nbsp; Pope Paul&nbsp; III on&nbsp; November 1,&nbsp; 1542, and was finally opened December 13, 1545.&nbsp; This council held twenty-five sessions at various times,&nbsp; some of them at Bologna.&nbsp; It was prorogued&nbsp; several times.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was prorogued on the 28th of April, 1552.&nbsp; Pope Pius IV convoked the council&nbsp; again on the 18th of January, 1563.&nbsp;&nbsp; This council passed many resolutions&nbsp; for&nbsp; reform, among which the recommendations as to&nbsp; marriage were not the least.&nbsp;&nbsp; (See Alcubilla, <i>Diccionario de la Administracion&nbsp; Espanola</i>, p. 4.)<br><br>The&nbsp; Council&nbsp; of Trent resolved&nbsp; "that henceforward&nbsp; all marriages not contracted&nbsp; in the presence of a priest and two or three witnesses&nbsp; shall be void."&nbsp;&nbsp; (See 3 Alcubilla, 63.)<br><br>It was the purpose of the Council of Trent to have its resolutions adopted and&nbsp; enforced in all Catholic communities.&nbsp; Philip II accepted as a law of the&nbsp; State&nbsp; by royal cedula dated in Madrid the 12th of July,&nbsp; 1564, the decrees of the Council of Trent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (See <i>Novisima&nbsp; Recopilacion</i>, law 13, title I, book I.)<br><br>W. Prescott states&nbsp; in his famous history of the reign of Philip II that it was his&nbsp; policy to enforce strict conformity to the Roman Catholic communion.&nbsp;&nbsp; That no marriage was valid unless, celebrated according&nbsp; to the rites&nbsp; of, and&nbsp; in observance of&nbsp; the principles laid down by the canon law. These ecclesiastical&nbsp; laws&nbsp; continued to rule in Spain&nbsp; for over three centuries, but upon the dethronement of Isabela II&nbsp; (1868)&nbsp; the question&nbsp; arose whether the civil marriage ought not to be introduced.&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp; the 18th day&nbsp; of&nbsp; June, 1870, a new law was passed&nbsp; (<i>La Ley Provisional de Matrimonio Civi</i>l) enacting that a civil ceremony alone made a lawful contract and that the&nbsp; marriage&nbsp; ceremony should be performed by civil officials.&nbsp;&nbsp; But in 1875 when the conservative party was reinstated, and&nbsp; the minor king, Alfonso XII had ascended the throne, the&nbsp; regency, by a mere <i>decreto (real decreto&nbsp; de 9&nbsp; de&nbsp; Febrero, 1875)</i> revived the religious marriage of the Council of Trent.&nbsp; It will be borne in mind, however, that this real decreto of the Queen Regent allowed the laws relating to civil marriage to remain in force.&nbsp; The&nbsp; said&nbsp; real decreto&nbsp; (9th of February, 1875)&nbsp; made&nbsp; certain exceptions.&nbsp; They, <i>"de otra creencia que la verdadera y malos catolicos"</i> who remained, in consequence of their nonobservance of&nbsp; religion regarding marriage&nbsp; <i>"imposibilitados&nbsp; de&nbsp; santificarlo&nbsp;&nbsp; el&nbsp; Sacramento."</i> Later, on the 27th of February, 1875, another decree was issued by the Queen&nbsp; Regent,&nbsp; providing&nbsp; that no&nbsp; Roman Catholic could celebrate in Spain a valid marriage before acivil official. (See 25 American Law Review, p.52<br><blockquote>"Philip the Second, by royal cedula dated Madrid, July 12, 1564, accepting as law of the State the decrees of the Council of Trent, extinguished completely the last vestiges of our laws of the forum, and he brought to the highest state of perfection the unification of civil and Catholic marriages, at the time when, in the rest of Europe, a new era was opened to&nbsp; the&nbsp; marital legislation&nbsp; of&nbsp; the middle ages through&nbsp; the reform that broke the bonds which up to then had united&nbsp; Church and&nbsp; State.&nbsp; Wherever&nbsp; religious&nbsp; communions were established other&nbsp; than Catholic, it <i>was no longer possible for the State not to recognize as legitimate many marriages which the Catholic Church had not blessed.</i>"<br></blockquote>The resolutions of the Council&nbsp; of Trent were adopted as a part of the laws&nbsp; of the Kingdom of&nbsp; Spain.&nbsp; Article 75 of the Civil&nbsp; Code (Spanish) provides that "the requisites, forms, and solemnities for the celebration of canonical marriages shall&nbsp; be governed by the provisions of the Catholic Church, and of the Holy Council of Trent,&nbsp; accepted as laws of the kingdom."&nbsp;&nbsp; It will be noted, however, that the provisions of the Catholic Church and of the Holy Council of Trent&nbsp; were only accepted with reference to canonical marriages.&nbsp; The Civil Code&nbsp; (Spanish) chapter 3, title 4, from articles 83 to 100, relating to civil marriages, provides for the capacity of the contracting parties&nbsp; and the celebration of the marriage.&nbsp; The Civil Code (Spanish) also&nbsp; provides for civil marriages in which there was no provision&nbsp; for the intervention of priest or of the Church.<br><br>The Civil&nbsp; Code was promulgated in&nbsp; Spain on&nbsp; the 30th of June, 1876.&nbsp; It will be remembered, however,&nbsp; that six years&nbsp; prior to the adoption of the Civil Code, to wit, on the 18th&nbsp; of June, 1870, there were promulgated "<i>Las Leyes Provisionales del Matrimonio" </i> In said law (June 18,1870) there seems to&nbsp; have been no provision whatever for the celebration of canonical marriages, recognized by said law; neither were the forms prescribed by the&nbsp; Catholic Church and by the holy Council of Trent for the celebration of marriages expressly prohibited.<br><br>The exact date when the preparation of the <i>Siete&nbsp; Partidas</i> was commenced and completed is not expressly stated by any of the authors.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is certain, however, that <i>El Rey Don Alfonso&nbsp; El Sabio,</i>&nbsp; ordered&nbsp; their preparation in the early part of the thirteenth century (1251) and that they were probably completed in the early part of the&nbsp; fourteenth century&nbsp; (perhaps 1330).&nbsp; The&nbsp; provisions of law&nbsp; 1,&nbsp; title 13, Partida 4, above quoted, relating to the effect of a second marriage entered into in good faith by one or both of the spouses,&nbsp; continued in force up to the time of the promulgation of <i>"Las Leyes Provisionales del Matrimonio"</i> in 1870, and were in force in Las Indias during all that period.&nbsp; The law of 1870 makes no express reference to the provisions of the Partidas.&nbsp; Said law, however, in the third&nbsp; section of chapter 3, contains the following provisions:<br><blockquote>"Art.&nbsp; 94.&nbsp; A null marriage, contracted&nbsp; in good faith by both spouses, shall produce all its civil effects while it lasts and the legitimacy&nbsp; of the children.<br><br>"Art.&nbsp; 95.&nbsp; That contracted in&nbsp; good faith by one of them shall produce the effects&nbsp; mentioned in the preceding article only with respect to the&nbsp; innocent&nbsp; spouse and the children.<br><br>"Art.&nbsp; 96.&nbsp; Good faith&nbsp; shall&nbsp; always be presumed, unless the contrary is proved."</blockquote>It will be noted that the&nbsp; provisions of&nbsp; the above-quoted articles were substantially the same as those of the <i><i>Partidas</i></i> above quoted and were brought forward and now constitute in effect article 69 of the Spanish Civil Code, which was made effective in the Civil&nbsp; Code applicable to the&nbsp; Philippine Islands on the&nbsp; 8th of December, 1889.&nbsp; The above provisions&nbsp; of the Civil Code,&nbsp; however, remained in force in the Philippine Islands but a&nbsp; few days, for the reason that General Weyler on&nbsp; the 29th of December, 1889, issued the following order:<br></y><y additional="" one="" presented="" them,="" notwithstanding="" objection="" counsel="" for ="" plaintiffs,="" by="" an="" dated="" april="" 4, ="" 1908,="" certified="" supplementary="" exceptions;="" considering="" appointment="" of ="" gregorio="" sy="" quia="" receiver="" made="" suggestion="" open ="" court, ="" at="" which="" time="" amount="" bond="" fixed="" knowledge="" defendants,="" also="" directing="" a ="" statement="" property="" received="" by ="" the ="" defendants="" submitted="" within="" a="" specified ="" time, ="" ordered="" that="" execution="" judgment ="" be="" not="" stayed="" so="" far ="" as="" latter ="" order="" concerned,="" original="" bill="" exceptions,="" together ="" sup ="" plementary ="" one, ="" was="" duly="" forwarded="" to="" clerk ="" of="" this="" court="" in="" connection="" with="" the="" appeal="" taken="" and="" allowed.=""><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">"GENERAL GOVERNMENT OP THE PHILIPPINES,<br>"SECRETARY'S OFFICE, BUREAU NO. 2,<br></div><div style="text-align: right;"><i>"Manila, December 29, 1889.</i><br></div><br>"By direction of Her Majesty's Government, until further orders, titles 4 and 12 of the Civil Code, extended to these Islands by royal&nbsp;

titles 4 and 12 referred to by&nbsp; General Weyler&nbsp; refer&nbsp; to titles 4 and 12 of book I, for the&nbsp; reason that some of the other books of the Civil Code also contain titles 4 and 12.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is now,&nbsp; however, well established that&nbsp; the titles referred to by&nbsp; General Weyler are titles&nbsp; 4 and 12 of&nbsp; book I.&nbsp;&nbsp; (See Benedicto <i>vs.</i> De la Rama, 3 Phil. Rep., 34.)<br><br>The law of 1870 was never promulgated&nbsp; in the Philippine Islands, except articles 44-78, inclusive.&nbsp;&nbsp; (See&nbsp; royal decree of April 13, 1883.)<br><br>It might be argued that&nbsp; the promulgation of&nbsp; the provisions of article 69 of the Civil Code in the Philippine Islands had the effect of annulling the provisions of the Partidas theretofore in force. But even admitting that to be&nbsp; true, by reference to the proclamation or decree&nbsp; of General Weyler, it will be found that he provided for the reestablishment of the laws relating to marriage, legitimacy, etc., which had hitherto been in force.&nbsp;&nbsp; It would seem to be clear, therefore, without referring to the provisions of the Civil Code, that at the time of the marriage of Sy Quia, law 1, title 13 of Partida 4&nbsp; was the law in force in the Philippine Islands, and that each of his wives,&nbsp; under the circumstances in the present case, should&nbsp; be&nbsp; considered legitimate, and the children born of each marriage should be regarded as legitimate children, and that said wives should each be entitled to the benefits of the provisions of article 1392 of the&nbsp; Civil Code.<br><br>The ecclesiastical decrees had no effect in Spain until they had been&nbsp; adopted by the King.&nbsp;&nbsp; They were only binding upon the ecclesiastical bodies within the territory and&nbsp; upon the&nbsp; civil authorities when the Government of Spain expressly made them so; in&nbsp; other words, the mere adoption of an ecclesiastical order&nbsp; or law&nbsp; governing the holy&nbsp; Catholic Church in Spanish territory was only binding as a civil law, when the same&nbsp; was expressly adopted by the King. Therefore, the mere fact that the marriage ceremony had not been solemnized in accordance with the provisions of the holy council of Trent,did not make such marriage null.<br><br>In the case of Patton <i>vs.</i> The Cities of Philadelphia and New Orleans, the court held that the ceremony performed by the said <i>commandante </i>had all the legal effect of a marriage per verba de prsesenti and that t he parties to the contract&nbsp; were&nbsp; recognized as husband and&nbsp; wife, and that<i> it had all the&nbsp; civil effects of a marriage&nbsp; contract </i> The <i>commandante, </i> in the&nbsp; celebration of the marriage ceremony, declared that he had performed the marriage in conformity with a <i>custom sanctioned</i> by the Government.&nbsp; The Supreme Court&nbsp; of the United&nbsp; States,&nbsp; in the case of Arredondo vs. United States&nbsp; (6 Peters, 691, 714),&nbsp; said that when the <i>commandante </i>says&nbsp; he had authority and exercised it, his authority will be presumed and that no one can&nbsp; question it but&nbsp; his superiors.<br><br>It was admitted that Eleonore Hook married&nbsp; Morehouse in good faith,&nbsp; believing that there was no existing impediment&nbsp; to such marriage&nbsp; and&nbsp; that&nbsp; all&nbsp; of the&nbsp; children were begotten&nbsp; or born before&nbsp; she&nbsp; had any knowledge of the fact that there existed&nbsp; a legal impediment&nbsp; to&nbsp; such marriage.&nbsp;&nbsp; The court held, in discussing&nbsp; the question of the rights&nbsp; of each of the wives,&nbsp; <i>"that the laws of Spam recognized in such cases, two entire communities." </i>&nbsp; As the wife, under those laws forfeits her share of the&nbsp; acquests and gains,&nbsp; when she is guilty of&nbsp; adultery, <i>so the&nbsp; husband forfeits his&nbsp; share when he has two wives living, and each of the wives takes the undivided one-half to which the law would&nbsp; entitle her if she was alone."</i><br><br>Paz, in his sixty-first consulta, class&nbsp; 9, states the law as follows, in a case identically&nbsp; the same&nbsp; as the present:<br><blockquote>"Out of the acquests and gains, the&nbsp; debts must&nbsp; be paid, because what the parties owe during the marriage&nbsp; can not form a part of the acquests and gains, and belongs to the creditors.&nbsp; The&nbsp; balance, after paying the debts, must&nbsp; be divided between the two wives, without any&nbsp; portion of it going&nbsp; to the succession&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; husband.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; reason&nbsp; of this is that by the laws of&nbsp; this realm, one-half of the acquests or gains belongs to the first wife, although they have been made by the husband&nbsp; (book 5,&nbsp; N<i>ew Recopilacion, </i>title 9, I, 1-6), and although the second law of this title requires the cohabitation&nbsp; of the wife with the husband in order that she be entitled&nbsp; to her share, yet as the marital cohabitation has not failed&nbsp; through her fault, but on the contrary through the fault of&nbsp; her husband, who abandoned her, s<i>he is not to&nbsp; lose her rights on account&nbsp; of the faults or misconduct of her husband.&nbsp; Imputari non debit ei per quern non stat si&nbsp; non faciat quod&nbsp; per cum fuerat faciendum."&nbsp; </i>(De Reg.&nbsp; Jur. 6, reg. 41.)</blockquote>To the&nbsp; second&nbsp; wife, the&nbsp; other&nbsp; one-half is&nbsp; due because by virtue&nbsp; of her good faith at the time of her marriage, <i>she&nbsp; is reputed the lawful wife, for the same reason for which the, law recognizes her issue as legitimate.<br></i><br>This&nbsp; doctrine&nbsp; is confirmed by Covarrubias <i> en Epi</i>t.&nbsp; (p. 2, chap. 7, sec. 1,&nbsp; No. 7); Antonio Gomez&nbsp; (1, 50 de Toro, No.&nbsp; 77) ; and Molina (De Just.&nbsp; Tract. 2, Disp.&nbsp; 432), who all agree that it is the common opinion of the&nbsp; doctors of the&nbsp; law that a woman marrying&nbsp; in good&nbsp; faith, although the marriage may be null,&nbsp; is entitled to one-half the acquests and gains, <i>from which it results that one-half goes to each of the wives</i>, and that the husband, deceiving the second&nbsp; and doing&nbsp; a grievous wrong to the first, refuses unjustly to either, the share which belongs&nbsp; to her,&nbsp; and that he is bound to satisfy both out of everything he possesses,&nbsp; because the&nbsp; law favors&nbsp; those&nbsp; who&nbsp; are deceived against those deceiving them. <i> Cum deceptis&nbsp; et non decipientibus jura subveniunt</i><br><blockquote>"In&nbsp; taking from the father's succession those acquests and&nbsp; gains, no wrong is done the inheritance or legitimate portion of his children, because&nbsp; this is a just debt, which he owes to his two wives, and the thing which the father owes is not inherited by his&nbsp; children,&nbsp; but taken by his creditors as&nbsp; their&nbsp; own."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Paz,&nbsp; <i>Consultas&nbsp; Varias,</i>&nbsp; pp. 483-484.)</blockquote>The next case&nbsp; involving the same question is&nbsp; that&nbsp; of Hubbell <i>vs</i>. Inkstein (April, 1852), 7 La. An., 252.&nbsp; The facts were substantially as follows.<br><br>Julius Hubbell, who had&nbsp; been legally married to one Sarah Hubbell in the&nbsp; State of New York, went to the State of Louisiana&nbsp; in&nbsp; 1820 and there,&nbsp; in&nbsp; 1826, married Mary Inkstein.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; 1837, Julius Hubbell&nbsp; died,&nbsp; leaving a considerable amount of property in the State of Louisiana which he "had acquired&nbsp; during his&nbsp; residence&nbsp; in 1ihe&nbsp; said State.&nbsp;&nbsp; This property was taken possession of by his second wife and was finally distributed between her and the children&nbsp; born of her marriage with Julius&nbsp; Hubbell.&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, Sarah Hubbell, the&nbsp; first&nbsp; wife, brought an&nbsp; action&nbsp; against Mary Inkstein et al.&nbsp; to recover the entire property&nbsp; of which the said Julius Hubbell had died seized.&nbsp; In deciding the case, Rost, justice, speaking for&nbsp; the&nbsp; court, said&nbsp; (p. 253):<br><blockquote>"Being of opinion that&nbsp; there is nothing in the record&nbsp; to show that Mary Inkstein ceased to be in good faith before the death&nbsp; of Julius Hubbell,&nbsp; or until&nbsp; long&nbsp; afterwards, <i>we consider her&nbsp; entitled to the rights of a lawful wife.</i> *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; We are, therefore, of&nbsp; opinion that Sarah Hubbell and&nbsp; Mary&nbsp; Inkstein were each&nbsp; entitled to&nbsp; one-half of the acquests and gains at his death."</blockquote>The next case which came before the courts of the United States in which the same question was discussed was that of Lee <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Smith (1856), 18 Tex.,&nbsp; 142.&nbsp; In&nbsp; that case one William&nbsp; Smith married&nbsp; Harriet&nbsp; Stone in&nbsp; the State&nbsp; of Missouri, in 1822, by whom he had three children before 1828.&nbsp; He&nbsp; then abandoned his&nbsp; wife, went&nbsp; to Texas,&nbsp; and under the name of John W. Smith, in 1831 or 1832, married,&nbsp; according to the&nbsp; laws of the State of&nbsp; Texas,&nbsp; one Maria Jesusa Delgado.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; said&nbsp; Maria&nbsp; Delgado&nbsp; (the second wife)&nbsp; was totally ignorant of the first marriage. The husband died in 1845.&nbsp; During the marriage with the second wife a&nbsp; large estate&nbsp; was acquired.&nbsp; At the&nbsp; time&nbsp; of the marriage with the second&nbsp; wife neither had any property.&nbsp;&nbsp; Harriet&nbsp; Stone,&nbsp; the first wife,&nbsp; in&nbsp; or about the year 1833, obtained a divorce from her husband, the said William Smith.&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, the children of the&nbsp; first wife brought an action for the partition and distribution&nbsp; of the property&nbsp; of their father&nbsp; between&nbsp; them and the&nbsp; wife and children&nbsp; of the second&nbsp; marriage.&nbsp; The court granted the partition, and, in deciding the question, said (p. 145):<br><blockquote>"The second&nbsp; marriage of Smith with&nbsp; Maria Jesusa Delgado&nbsp; was not null and void in law,&nbsp; with reference either to the wife or&nbsp; the children of&nbsp; that marriage.&nbsp; In Spanish law, such a marriage&nbsp; is designated&nbsp; as&nbsp; putative,&nbsp; and the consort who enters into such matrimony ignorant that her partner&nbsp; has a&nbsp; wife&nbsp; or husband living, <i>is in law not only innocent of a crime, but has all the&nbsp; rights, incidents, and privileges pertaining to a&nbsp; lawful marriage,</i> and these are continued as long as there is ignorance of the former or&nbsp; of an impediment to&nbsp; the&nbsp; second marriage."</blockquote>In the case of Abston et al. <i>vs.</i> Abston et&nbsp; al.&nbsp; (March, 1860), (15 La. An., 137),&nbsp; the&nbsp; supreme court&nbsp; of Louisiana again&nbsp; reiterated the doctrine&nbsp; laid down in the cases&nbsp; of Clendenning vs. Clendenning,&nbsp; and Patton <i>vs.</i> Philadelphia, as well as in that of Hubbell<i> vs.</i> Inkstein.<br><br>In that case one John Abston married Olive Hart in the State of&nbsp; Alabama.&nbsp; John N. Abston,&nbsp; one of the parties&nbsp; to the suit,&nbsp; was a&nbsp; son born of that marriage.&nbsp; Later, the said John Abston abandoned his family in the State of Alabama, and without having obtained a divorce <i>a vinculo matrimonii</i> from&nbsp; his first wife, entered into a second marriage in the State of Mississippi with one Suzanne Bell.&nbsp; Later Suzanne Bell&nbsp; died; after the death of the second wife, Suzanne Bell, still being undivorced from his first wife, John&nbsp; Abston married&nbsp; one&nbsp; Rebecca&nbsp; Wright in the&nbsp; State of&nbsp; Mississippi, and of this third&nbsp; marriage there&nbsp; was born a&nbsp; child called Nancy Nix Abston.&nbsp; During the marriage relation between the said&nbsp; John Abston and Rebecca Wright, and while they were still living in the State&nbsp; of Mississippi, John&nbsp; Abston made a will bequeathing to his third wife, Rebecca Wright, the&nbsp; whole of his estate&nbsp; after the payment&nbsp; of&nbsp; his&nbsp; debts. After&nbsp; the making of the said will and&nbsp; before&nbsp; his&nbsp; death, John Abston, with his&nbsp; third wife and&nbsp; child removed to the State of Louisiana and there died.&nbsp; Later his said&nbsp; will was duly admitted&nbsp; to probate and executed in the State of Louisiana.&nbsp; (No dates are given&nbsp; as&nbsp; to these various incidents.)<br><br>Later the said Olive Abston and her son, John N. Abston, commenced an action in the courts of the State of Louisiana for the purpose of securing their portion of the property of the&nbsp; deceased&nbsp; John Abston.&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp; action&nbsp; was&nbsp; brought against the third wife, Rebecca Wright, and her daughter, the said Nancy Nix Abston.&nbsp; Under these facts, the supreme court of Louisiana decided:<br><br>First That the decree of partition of the court ordering the said will of John Abston&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; executed did&nbsp; not amount to a judgment&nbsp; binding on&nbsp; those who&nbsp; were&nbsp; not parties to those proceedings, and that&nbsp; the&nbsp; court subsequently had&nbsp; a&nbsp; right&nbsp; to inquire&nbsp; into the validity&nbsp; of&nbsp; the title of the property of the said Rebecca Wright,&nbsp; under the said will.<br><br>Second. That the plaintiff, <i>Olive Abston, was declared to be entitled to one-half of the community property in&nbsp; the succession of John Abston, deceased, and that the defendant, Rebecca Wright, be declared to be entitled to one-half of the said community property.<br></i><br>Third. That John N. Abston (the child of the&nbsp; first marriage)&nbsp; and Nancy Nix Abston (the child of the third marriage)&nbsp; be recognized as heirs at law to the separate property or estate of their deceased father, John Abston.<br><br>In the case of Gaines <i>vs</i>. Hennen (December, 1860),&nbsp; (65 U. S.,&nbsp; 553), the Supreme Court of the United States disussed this same question at length.&nbsp; In order to understand the&nbsp; above case of Gaines vs.&nbsp; Hennen fully it will be necessary to read the&nbsp; cases of<i> Ex parte</i> Myra Clarke Whitney (38 U. S., 403), Gaines et al. <i>vs</i>. Relf et al.&nbsp; (40&nbsp; U. S., 8), Gaines et al. vs. Relf et al.&nbsp; (43 U. S., 619), Patterson <i>vs.</i> Games&nbsp; (47 U. S., 550), Gaines <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Relf&nbsp; et al.&nbsp; (53&nbsp; U. S., 472), Gaines <i>vs.</i> New Orleans (73 U. S., 642), Davis vs. Gaines&nbsp; (14 Otto,&nbsp; 386, 406), and&nbsp; Gaines <i>vs</i>.&nbsp; De la Croix (73 U.&nbsp; S., 719).<br><br>In the&nbsp; above case&nbsp; of&nbsp; Gaines <i>vs</i>.&nbsp; Hennen, the Supreme Court of the United States cited and&nbsp; approved the decisions of the supreme court&nbsp; of Louisiana in the cases of Clendenning <i>vs</i>.&nbsp; Clendenning (7 Martin's Reports,&nbsp; 587),&nbsp; Patton vs. The Cities of Philadelphia and New Orleans (1 La. An., 98), and&nbsp; Abston <i>vs.</i> Abston&nbsp; (15 La. An., 137).<br><br>In the&nbsp; case of the&nbsp; succession of J.&nbsp; B.&nbsp; Navarro&nbsp; (April, 1872), 24 La. An., 298, the facts appeared to be as follows:<br><br>Jean&nbsp; Baptiste Navarro was married in Italy in&nbsp; August, 1833, to one Marie Massucco.&nbsp; He abandoned his wife in Italy and came to the State of Louisiana in&nbsp; 1841&nbsp; and in 1851 was there married to one Anastasie La France, while the&nbsp; first marriage in Italy&nbsp; was undissolved.&nbsp; The second wife, Anastasie La France,&nbsp; died on or about the 12th&nbsp; day of January, 1869.&nbsp; Jean Baptiste Navarro died on the 21st day of January, 1869.&nbsp; Of the marriage of Jean Baptiste Navarro and Anastasie La&nbsp; France there was born&nbsp; a&nbsp; son called Paul Augustin Navarro, who survived them.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first wife, Marie Massucco, died on the 23d day of October, 1870.&nbsp; Jean Baptiste&nbsp; Navarro during this second marriage had accumulated property which inventoried&nbsp; $20,759. <i> An action was brought by the representatives or heirs of Marie Massucco&nbsp; to recover her interest in&nbsp; the estate of her husband (Jean Baptiste Navarro)&nbsp; claiming one-half of his estate as his legitimate widow.&nbsp; Paul Augustin Navarro (the issue of the second marriage)&nbsp; claimed the other one-half of the estate of his deceased father.&nbsp; The supreme&nbsp; court of Louisiana granted&nbsp; the petition&nbsp; of the&nbsp; respective&nbsp; heirs,</i> citing and approving&nbsp; again the decisions&nbsp; of&nbsp; Clendenning <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Clendenning, Patton vs. The Cities&nbsp; of Philadelphia and New Orleans, Hubbell<i> vs</i>. Inkstein, and Abston<i> vs.</i> Abston. (See also Glass <i>vs.</i> Glass&nbsp; (January, 1874), 114&nbsp; Mass., 563.)<br><br>In the case of Harrington <i>vs.</i> Barfield et al.&nbsp; (July, 1878), (30&nbsp; La. An., 1297), one Harrington in 1851 married&nbsp; Cecelia Barfield, while he had living in another State, from whom he was undivorced, another wife known as Matilda J. Kelley.&nbsp; Soon after&nbsp; the&nbsp; marriage of Harrington&nbsp; with Barfield, they left the State of Louisiana and went to the State of Arkansas, where a son was born to them.&nbsp; Cecelia, at the time of her marriage, had a brother and sister living; her parents were also living at that time.&nbsp; Later her parents died and her brother and sister, Ira and Isabelle, divided the estate of their parents, believing that Cecelia was no longer living.&nbsp; Later, in 1875,&nbsp; the son born of the marriage of Harrington and Cecelia appeared in the locality where <i><i>Ira and Isabelle lived and&nbsp; demanded his mother's&nbsp; share of his grandfather's&nbsp; estate.&nbsp;&nbsp; His mother had then&nbsp; been dead several&nbsp; years, having died&nbsp; in the State of Arkansas. Ira and Isabelle&nbsp; claimed that he&nbsp; was a bastard and had no interest in the estate&nbsp; of their father.&nbsp;&nbsp; The court held that the marriage of Harrington and Cecelia, so far as Cecelia was concerned, was a lawful manage and that the son born of said marriage was a legitimate son and was entitled to his mother's interest&nbsp; in his grandfather's estate. </i></i><br><br>(See also the succession of J. C. Taylor&nbsp; (June, 1887), 39 La. An., 823.)<br><br>The next case which&nbsp; came before&nbsp; the supreme court of Louisiana was the case of Jermann <i>vs</i>. Tenneas et al. (May, 1892).&nbsp; This case had been before the court before and is reported in La.&nbsp; An.,&nbsp; 39, p.&nbsp; 1021.&nbsp; In that&nbsp; case the facts seem to be as follows:<br><br>One Francis Jermann&nbsp; was married to Josephine Attinger, in the village&nbsp; of Moos, Germany,&nbsp; on the 19th day of March, 1851.&nbsp; Later&nbsp; and after a child had been born of this marriage the said Francis Jermann removed to the city of New Orleans and&nbsp; was there&nbsp; known as Francis Germaine.&nbsp; In the city of New Orleans the said&nbsp; Francis Jermann&nbsp; (Germaine)&nbsp; in the year 1855 married Mary Tenneas, of which marriage there were&nbsp; several children born.&nbsp; Francis Jer mann (Germaine) died in the city of New Orleans in 1873. During the continuance of the marriage relation between Francis Jermann&nbsp; (Germaine)&nbsp; and Mary&nbsp; Tenneas, a considerable&nbsp; amount of property was&nbsp; acquired.&nbsp; There was some question raised with reference to whether the Francis Jermann who married Josephine Attinger in 1851 was the Francis&nbsp; Germaine who married Mary&nbsp; Tenneas&nbsp; in&nbsp; 1855. The lower court held and the&nbsp; supreme&nbsp; court affirmed it that these names referred to the same person, <i> It was admitted that all of the property that the said Francis Jermann had at the&nbsp; time of his death had been&nbsp; acquired by him during the existence&nbsp; of the second marriage. </i> In 1886 or 1887 Josephine Jermann (Attinger)&nbsp; the first wife brought an action against Mary Tenneas et al. to recover her&nbsp; share of the&nbsp; estate of&nbsp; the&nbsp; said Francis&nbsp; Jermann. <i> The&nbsp; court allowed the claim of the plaintiff and said (</i>44 La. An., 620, 627):<br><blockquote>"It&nbsp; [referring to the conjugal property]&nbsp; was&nbsp; acquired during the community <i>regime,</i>&nbsp; and,&nbsp; at the&nbsp; dissolution of the community,&nbsp; by the death&nbsp; of the husband, <i>title to half vested in Josephine Attinger, regardless of the second marriage, whether contracted in good faith&nbsp; or not"</i></blockquote>Here again the&nbsp; supreme court of Louisiana cited and approved the decisions in the cases of&nbsp; Clendenning <i>vs</i>.&nbsp; Clendenning, Patton&nbsp; <i>vs</i>. Philadelphia et al., Hubbell <i>vs.</i> Inkstein, and&nbsp; Abston&nbsp; <i>vs</i>. Abston.<br><br>This same doctrine is recognized by the statutes of several of the States of the United States.&nbsp; (See&nbsp; the Revised&nbsp; Statutes of New&nbsp; York&nbsp; (1882), sec. 1745,&nbsp; vol. 2, p. 2702;&nbsp; Genera]&nbsp; Statutes of Massachusetts, chap. 107, sees. 4 and&nbsp; 30; see also Code of&nbsp; Napoleon, arts. 201, 202;&nbsp; Pothier, <i>Contract du Marriage,</i> vol.&nbsp; 3, pp. 172, 107; Toullier, vol. 1, p. 598; Marcadi, <i>Explication du Code, </i>vol. 1,&nbsp; p. 520; Dalton's Dictionary, vol. 2, p. 372; Laws&nbsp; of the Indies, law 1, title&nbsp; 13, <i>Partida 4.)<br></i><br>This is also the doctrine of article&nbsp; 69 of the Civil Code, which in effect is the same as that of law 1, title 13, <i>Partida</i> 4.&nbsp; Said article&nbsp; 69 provides:<br><blockquote>"A marriage&nbsp; contracted&nbsp; in good&nbsp; faith produces&nbsp; <i>civil effects,</i> although&nbsp; it may be declared&nbsp; void.&nbsp; If good&nbsp; faith existed on the part of only one of the spouses, it shall produce civil&nbsp; effects only with <i>regard to the said spouse and to the children.</i>&nbsp; Good faith&nbsp; is presumed if the contrary does not appear."</blockquote>(See. also Manresa,&nbsp; 1 Codigo&nbsp; Civil, 309-312.)<br><br>The phrase in article 69 "civil effects" means that even though the marriage was null&nbsp; and void, if it was contracted in good faith,&nbsp; the&nbsp; parties who&nbsp; contracted&nbsp; the same&nbsp; in good faith shall have the same&nbsp; rights under the law, with reference to the community property,&nbsp; as if the marriage was&nbsp; absolutely legal.&nbsp;&nbsp; Article 1392 contains the provisions of the Civil Code relating to&nbsp; the rights of the spouses in the community property or conjugal&nbsp; partnership property.<br><br>Pothier, in&nbsp; his commentaries&nbsp; upon the contract of marriage under the Spanish&nbsp; law,&nbsp; discusses this question&nbsp; at length and says&nbsp; (pp. 190 and 193):<br><blockquote>"It is a much debated&nbsp; question among the doctors&nbsp; of law&nbsp; whether&nbsp; or&nbsp; not&nbsp; this&nbsp; rule&nbsp; should&nbsp; allow&nbsp; an&nbsp; exception in the case where one of the parties is unaware that&nbsp; the other was married at the time of having the carnal&nbsp; relations.&nbsp; Those who take the affirmative base their&nbsp; argument on the&nbsp; chapter <i>Ex tenor e,&nbsp; extr. qui fili sint legit,</i> according to which, as we shall see below, article 4,&nbsp; when one of the parties in&nbsp; good faith contracts a marriage that is null and void, believing it to be legitimate through ignorance&nbsp; of&nbsp; the existence of&nbsp; the impediment that&nbsp; makes it void, as when a woman marries a man whom she does not know is already married to another woman, the good faith of this second presumed&nbsp; spouse causes them&nbsp; to grant&nbsp; to <i>this&nbsp; marriage,</i> although null and void, <i> all the effects of a legitimate marriage, and consequently, the titles and rights of legitimate children to those begotten herein.</i><br><br>"There are marriages which, although null and&nbsp; void, produce civil effects by operation of law,&nbsp; in consideration&nbsp; of the good faith of the parties&nbsp; or of one of them who was ignorant of the impediment which nullified the marriage."</blockquote>Our conclusion is, therefore, with reference to the second question:<br><br>(<i>a</i>) That the marriage&nbsp; of Sy Quia with Yap&nbsp; Buanju in China in 1847&nbsp; was contracted in accordance with the forms prescribed&nbsp; by&nbsp; the Chinese&nbsp; laws and was&nbsp; entered into in good faith.<br><br><i>(b</i>) That the marriage of Sy&nbsp; Quia with Petronila Encarnacion in the Philippine Islands&nbsp; in 1853 was solemnized in accordance with the laws of the Philippine&nbsp; Islands and was, so far as Petronila Encarnacion was concerned, entered into in good faith; therefore,&nbsp; in accordance with the provisions of law&nbsp; 1,&nbsp; title 13,&nbsp; Partida&nbsp; 4,&nbsp; and article 1392 of the Civil Code, and in accordance&nbsp; with the jurisprudence established&nbsp; under the Spanish law, they are each&nbsp; entitled to one-half of&nbsp; the&nbsp; estate of the&nbsp; said Sy Quia.<br><br>With reference to the third question, to wit,&nbsp; "What are the rights of the&nbsp; children&nbsp; of&nbsp; the respective marriages in the estate of the said Sy Quia, he having died&nbsp; intestate?" no provision of the Civil Code has been&nbsp; found which attempts to answer this question,&nbsp; under the facts presented in the&nbsp; present case.&nbsp; The&nbsp; question is a&nbsp; difficult one of solution.<i>&nbsp; Paz,&nbsp; in his&nbsp; Consultas&nbsp; (sixty-first consulta,&nbsp; class 9) takes the view that while the children of the two&nbsp; marriages are&nbsp; legitimate, their interest in the estate of the common father is&nbsp; confined&nbsp; to&nbsp; the interest&nbsp; which their respective&nbsp; mothers inherit.&nbsp; He t takes the position&nbsp; that the claim of each of the wives a</i>gainst the estate of the husband&nbsp; is in the nature of a&nbsp; creditor, and says:<br><blockquote><i>"The balance, after paying the debtg, must&nbsp; be&nbsp; divided between&nbsp; the two wives, without&nbsp; any portion of it going to the succession of the husband </i> *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *.&nbsp; In taking&nbsp; from the father's succession those acquests and gains, no wrong is done the inheritance or legitimate portion of his children, because this (the claims of the respective&nbsp; wives) is a just debt which&nbsp; he&nbsp; owes to his&nbsp; two&nbsp; wives,&nbsp; and the thing the father owes is not inherited&nbsp; by his children, but&nbsp; is taken by his creditors as their&nbsp; own."&nbsp; (<i>Paz, Consultas&nbsp; Varias</i>, pp. 483, 484.)</blockquote>This doctrine seems to be humane and as well furnishes a&nbsp; solution of a most difficult and&nbsp; perplexing question.<br><br>The respective mothers are each entitled to one-half of the estate of the said Sy Quia and the children are entitled to the estate thus obtained by their respective mothers.<br><br>Marriages are governed by the <i>lex loci contractus.&nbsp; </i>If the marriage is valid&nbsp; where it&nbsp; was contracted&nbsp; and&nbsp; entered into,&nbsp; it is valid everywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp; (26&nbsp; Cyc.&nbsp; (Encyclopedia&nbsp; of Law and Procedure), 829; Travers <i>vs</i>. Reinhardt, 205 U.&nbsp; S., 423;&nbsp; Hawaii <i>vs</i>. Si&nbsp; Shee, 12 Hawaii Reports, 329;&nbsp; Gaines <i>vs.</i> Hennen, 65 U. S., 553-631.)<br><br>We believe that the evidence in the present case is sufficient to show that the marriage of Sy Quia with Yap Buanju was in accordance with&nbsp; the laws&nbsp; and customs&nbsp; of&nbsp; China, and therefore was a valid marriage in China, and will&nbsp; be so considered in the Philippine Islands,<br><br>While&nbsp; it may or&nbsp; not&nbsp; be true that the marriage of Sy Quia&nbsp; with Petronila Encarnacion in the Philippine Islands made him or perhaps both of them criminally responsible for the crime of bigamy, yet the same was performed&nbsp; in accordance with the&nbsp; laws of the Philippine Islands and was entered into, at least by the said&nbsp; Petronila Encarnacion, in good faith, and there attached&nbsp; to said marriage&nbsp; all the civil rights, so far as the wife was concerned, which belong to marriage&nbsp; in&nbsp; general,&nbsp; in that she, so long&nbsp; as her good faith continued, succeeded to&nbsp; her&nbsp; share of&nbsp; the community property in accordance with article 1392 of the Civil Code, and the children born of this marriage were&nbsp; legitimate.<br><br>The right of succession&nbsp; to&nbsp; property by inheritance&nbsp; is determined generally:<br><br>(<i>a</i>) As to personal property, by the laws of the residence of the parties; and<br><br>(<i>b</i>) As to real property, by the location of the property.<br><br>As&nbsp; to personal property, the lex&nbsp; domicilii governs as a general rule; as to real property, the lex loci situs controls. (Gaines <i>vs</i>. Hennen, 65 U. S.,&nbsp; 553, 597; Abston <i>vs.</i> Abston, 15 La. An., 137; 14 Cyc.&nbsp; (Encyclopedia of Law and Procedure), 21 and&nbsp; cases.)<br><br>This is not the rule, however, with reference to the personal&nbsp; property&nbsp; of foreigners residing&nbsp; in the Philippine Islands.&nbsp; The Civil&nbsp; Code&nbsp; (art.&nbsp; 10) provides:<br><br>"Personal&nbsp; property is subject to the laws&nbsp; of the nation of the&nbsp; owner thereof;&nbsp; real property to the laws&nbsp; of&nbsp; the country in which&nbsp; it is&nbsp; situated.<br><blockquote>"However, legal and&nbsp; testamentary successions,&nbsp; with regard to the order of&nbsp; succession, as well as to the amount of the successional rights and to the intrinsic validity of their provisions, shall be&nbsp; regulated by&nbsp; the laws of&nbsp; the&nbsp; nation of the&nbsp; person&nbsp; whose succession is in&nbsp; question, whatever may be the nature of the property and the country where it may&nbsp; be situate.<br><br>"Biscayans, even though they reside in towns, shall continue subject, with&nbsp; regard to the property&nbsp; they&nbsp; possess in the&nbsp; level&nbsp; lands,&nbsp; to law 15,&nbsp; title&nbsp; 20,&nbsp; of the <i>Fuero&nbsp; de Vizcaya."</i>(<i>e</i>)&nbsp; That&nbsp; each be&nbsp; required to pay one-half the&nbsp; costs.<br></blockquote>This&nbsp; provision of&nbsp; the Civil Code&nbsp; has been the law&nbsp; of Spain, applicable to&nbsp; her foreign possessions, for a&nbsp; great many&nbsp; years.&nbsp;&nbsp; Substantially the same provision is found in law&nbsp; 15, title 14,&nbsp; of the third&nbsp; <i>Partida</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Substantially the same law exists&nbsp; in each of the&nbsp; South American States, Cuba and Porto Rico today, which were formerly under the jurisdiction of the Spanish Crown.&nbsp; Some&nbsp; South American States,&nbsp; however, have established the&nbsp; above-quoted general rule,&nbsp; to wit, that the law of inheritance of the place of the domicile&nbsp; of the owner of personal property is applicable to the inheritance&nbsp; of the same.<br><br>In the present case the father was a Chinaman, and there is nothing in the record which shows that he ever&nbsp; became a&nbsp; subject of the&nbsp; Crown&nbsp; of Spain.&nbsp; He never became a naturalized citizen of Spain, entitled to&nbsp; exercise the&nbsp; political rights granted under&nbsp; the Spanish&nbsp; Government in its colonial&nbsp; possessions.&nbsp;&nbsp; He&nbsp; lived&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Philippine Islands, so far as the&nbsp; record shows, permanently from&nbsp; 1852 or 1853 until the time of his death.&nbsp; His wife was a native of the Philippine Islands.&nbsp;&nbsp; The children living are now all adults. There is nothing&nbsp; in&nbsp; the record which shows or&nbsp; tends to show that they ever intended to leave&nbsp; the Philippine Islands.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact that they have always&nbsp; lived here and made the Philippine Islands their&nbsp; home raises a&nbsp; strong presumption, at least, that they had adopted the Philippine Islands as the place of their permanent abode.<br><br>The question is properly raised under the provisions of the Civil Code above quoted, in view of the fact that it was&nbsp; enacted many, many years&nbsp; ago,&nbsp; whether it was the intention of the Spanish&nbsp; Government to make&nbsp; the&nbsp; same applicable to foreigners who had taken up their permanent abode in the Spanish colonial possessions for the purpose of making such place their permanent home.&nbsp; Should not said article 10 be given an interpretation which would make a difference in the distribution of an&nbsp; inheritance between foreigners who are<i> domiciled</i> in the Philippine Islands <i>with the definite intention to&nbsp; return</i> to their native country some&nbsp; time&nbsp; in the&nbsp; future&nbsp; and those foreigners who are domiciled in the Philippine Islands&nbsp; permanently with the <i>intention of remaining&nbsp; here&nbsp; so&nbsp; long&nbsp; as they live?</i>&nbsp; For example, A, an American&nbsp; citizen, comes to&nbsp; the Philippine Islands with his wife and children for the purpose of making his permanent home here,&nbsp; without any intention whatever of removing elsewhere; he left the United&nbsp; States without the slightest intention of ever returning there for the purpose of residing.&nbsp; He engages in business in the Philippine Islands.&nbsp; He accumulates&nbsp; a&nbsp; large&nbsp; fortune.&nbsp; His&nbsp; children are educated&nbsp; here.&nbsp; He and&nbsp; his family have&nbsp; become an integral&nbsp; part of both the social and&nbsp; business relations of the country.&nbsp; He dies, leaving his wife and children, who have&nbsp; all reached their&nbsp; majorities.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another example: B, an American citizen, comes to the Philippine Islands with his&nbsp; wife and&nbsp; children,&nbsp; engages in business, but has the intention to return to his native country at some definite or indefinite future time.&nbsp;&nbsp; He has no intention of becoming a permanent resident in the Philippine Islands.&nbsp; His purpose is to acquire a fortune, if possible, and return to his&nbsp; native heath for the purpose of enjoying the fruits&nbsp; of his labor with his family there.&nbsp; Both&nbsp; or each A and B, while they are residing in the Philippine Islands,&nbsp; with their domicile here, are entitled to all of the civil rights accorded to citizens under the Government.&nbsp; Neither, however, are entitled to exercise political rights under the Government. The question is,&nbsp; Should said article 10&nbsp; apply equally to&nbsp; them?&nbsp; The first is&nbsp; a <i>permanent resident,</i> with a<i> permanent domicile;</i> the second a <i>temporary resident</i>, with a temporary domicile. Should&nbsp; the wife and children of A in&nbsp; the administration and distribution of his estate be&nbsp; compelled to invoke the provisions of&nbsp; the&nbsp; law of the State of the&nbsp; United States from which he came, in view of the fact that they have never had the slightest intention to return to the United States from the time they landed here?&nbsp;&nbsp; We&nbsp; do not&nbsp; believe that it was&nbsp; the purpose of the code makers,&nbsp; at the time they drafted&nbsp; said article 10, to compel the descendants of permanent&nbsp; residents&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippine Islands, even though not permitted to exercise the political rights under the Government, to invoke the laws of a foreign country, one to which they owed no allegiance whatever, in the administration and distribution of their inheritance.&nbsp; We believe that article 10 should be given such an interpretation as would permit&nbsp; foreigners&nbsp; who have permanently allied themselves with the interests of the country&nbsp; to have their property administered after their death in accordance <i>with the laws of the country which they have selected as their home. </i>&nbsp; We are living in a progressive age,&nbsp; and it is&nbsp; not believed that the present age should be governed by&nbsp; any ironclad interpretation of a statute of the centuries gone by which is contrary to the sense&nbsp; of the people of today.&nbsp;&nbsp; Statutes should be interpreted, so far as it is possible, to meet the conditions. While the courts are not permitted to amend the law, yet, nevertheless, they are&nbsp; permitted&nbsp; to give a law&nbsp; such an interpretation as will make it&nbsp; applicable to new conditions. Many examples might&nbsp; be given to show where this has been done.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is believed that the conditions in the Philippine Islands will justify the assertion that there are literally hundreds of families here who are not entitled to exercise the political rights of the Government, who are&nbsp; strangers in fact under the law, but who have adopted the Philippine Islands as the place of their <i>permanent abode</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; They have forsworn either in fact or by implication their&nbsp; allegiance to any&nbsp; other country or government.&nbsp; Should&nbsp; their descendants,&nbsp; in the face of&nbsp; these conditions, be compelled&nbsp; to resort to&nbsp; the laws of a&nbsp; foreign&nbsp; country,&nbsp; of&nbsp; which they know nothing and for which&nbsp; they care less, for&nbsp; rules and regulations in the administration&nbsp; and&nbsp; distribution of their inheritance?&nbsp;&nbsp; It may possibly be that they left their native land for the&nbsp; very purpose of evading the very laws&nbsp; in question.&nbsp;&nbsp; We believe that it&nbsp; is perfectly justifiable under the provisions of article 10, and in view of the provisions of the real decreto of the 17th day of November, 1852,&nbsp; as well as&nbsp; that of the 4th of July, 1870,&nbsp; to give said&nbsp; article such an interpretation as&nbsp; will permit foreigners&nbsp; who have adopted the Philippine Islands&nbsp; as their permanent&nbsp; home and domicile&nbsp; to&nbsp; have their property, after their&nbsp; death, administered and distributed to their descendants&nbsp; in accordance with the laws&nbsp; of this country&nbsp; the&nbsp; land&nbsp; which they have&nbsp; adopted as&nbsp; their permanent home and&nbsp; not&nbsp; in accordance with&nbsp; the laws of&nbsp; the&nbsp; country&nbsp; which they had permanently abandoned.&nbsp; No doubt many&nbsp; of&nbsp; the families to which reference is made above have for years not only been&nbsp; exercising the civil&nbsp; rights accorded&nbsp; them under the Spanish Government but have also exercised political rights. We believe that under such circumstances the law of presumption should&nbsp; be applied&nbsp; after&nbsp; they have exercised civil and political rights for a number of years, and&nbsp; that they should be presumed to be citizens&nbsp; of the country&nbsp; which they have&nbsp; adopted as&nbsp; their permanent home.&nbsp; To sustain this conclusion we invoke the doctrine established by the Supreme Court&nbsp; of the United States&nbsp; in the case of Boyd <i>vs.</i> Thayer (143&nbsp; U. S., 135).&nbsp; In&nbsp; that case, Mr.&nbsp; Boyd was born&nbsp; in the State of Ohio of&nbsp; foreign parents.&nbsp; His&nbsp; father had not been&nbsp; naturalized during his minority.&nbsp; Later he removed to the State of Nebraska and&nbsp; for a&nbsp; long period of years exercised both civil and political rights under the laws of the Territory and State&nbsp; of Nebraska.&nbsp;&nbsp; He&nbsp; was finally elected by the people of the State to the position of governor.&nbsp; The question&nbsp; as to&nbsp; his&nbsp; rights to exercise&nbsp; this political function in the State was questioned by quo warranto proceedings.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; case finally reached the Supreme Court of the United&nbsp; States.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; Supreme&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of the United&nbsp; States, Chief&nbsp; Justice Fuller writing&nbsp; the&nbsp; opinion, adopted the&nbsp; doctrine&nbsp; of&nbsp; "presumption of naturalization." Mr. Chief Justice Fuller said&nbsp; (p. 180):<br><blockquote>"It is true that naturalization under the Acts of Congress known&nbsp; as the Naturalization&nbsp; Laws&nbsp; can only be completed before&nbsp; a court, and that&nbsp; the&nbsp; usual proof of naturalization is a copy of the record of the&nbsp; court.&nbsp; But it is equally true that where no record of naturalization&nbsp; can be produced, evidence that a person, having the requisite qualifications to become&nbsp; a citizen, did in fact and for a long time vote and hold office and exercise rights belonging to citizens, is sufficient to warrant a jury in inferring that he had been duly naturalized as a citizen."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Boyd <i>vs</i>.&nbsp; Thayer, 143 U. S., 135, 180; Blight<i> vs</i>. Rochester, 7 Wheaton, 535, 546; Hogan <i> vs</i>.&nbsp; Kurtz, 94 U. S., 773, 778.)<br></blockquote>The&nbsp; Civil Code&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Republic of&nbsp; Argentina,&nbsp; South America, in its articles 10 and&nbsp; 11, which contain substantially the same provisions as article 10&nbsp; of the Civil Code of the&nbsp; Philippine Islands, has&nbsp; wisely&nbsp; recognized&nbsp; the&nbsp; difference between foreigners&nbsp; who are premanently&nbsp; residing in the Republic and foreigners who are residing temporarily there.&nbsp;&nbsp; Those foreigners who are permanently&nbsp; residing in that Republic&nbsp; are&nbsp; permitted&nbsp; to have&nbsp; their&nbsp; property&nbsp; administered and distributed after their death in accordance with the laws of the country, whether such property be real or personal, while those who are residing there temporarily are governed in the administration and distribution of their estates&nbsp; by the laws of their native country.&nbsp;&nbsp; (See&nbsp; Canedo, Vol. I, p. 51.)<br><br>In&nbsp; the&nbsp; present case, Sy Quia resided in the Philippine Islands at the time of his death and all of the property in question in the present case is located in the Philippine Islands.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore the laws relating to the descent and distribution of both personal and real property in litigation are the laws of the Philippine Islands.&nbsp;&nbsp; The contention of the appellants that the descent&nbsp; and distribution&nbsp; of&nbsp; the property should be governed by the&nbsp; laws of&nbsp; China is&nbsp; not tenable.<br><br>By the weight of authority&nbsp; the legitimacy of children depends upon the <i>lex&nbsp; fori. </i>&nbsp; We have seen that under&nbsp; the laws&nbsp; of Spain where&nbsp; a man has married a second wife without having the first marriage annulled, and where&nbsp; the second wife&nbsp; married in good faith,&nbsp; the&nbsp; children of such second marriage are legitimate.&nbsp; Of course, the children of the first&nbsp; marriage, which&nbsp; was&nbsp; entered&nbsp; into&nbsp; legally,&nbsp; are legitimate.&nbsp; We have also seen that the inheritance depends upon the lex domicilii.&nbsp; The rights of the legitimate children, therefore, depend upon&nbsp; the&nbsp; lex fori or the l<i>ex domicilii.</i> (Irving <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Ford (March,&nbsp; 1903), 183 Mass., 448; Minor's Conflict of Laws, sec. 10; Lingen <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Lingen, 54 Ala., 410; Wharton's Conflict&nbsp; of Laws, sec. 246;&nbsp; Loring<i> vs</i>.

A.,&nbsp; 177.)<br><br>It may be argued that&nbsp; inasmuch&nbsp; as the estate&nbsp; of&nbsp; the said Sy Quia&nbsp; had&nbsp; been settled and&nbsp; the&nbsp; property&nbsp; divided among the heirs in the Philippine Islands, that said estate can not be&nbsp; reopened for the purpose&nbsp; of considering&nbsp; the question of&nbsp; the right of property.&nbsp; The effect of the probation of the&nbsp; estate of the&nbsp; said 3y Quia has no effect whatever&nbsp; upon parties who have a right in the said estate and who were not made parties in said settlement.&nbsp; (Abston et al. <i>vs</i>. Abston et al., 15 La. An., 137; Sophie <i>vs. Duplessis, 2&nbsp; La. An.,&nbsp; 724; Succession of Dupuy, 4 La. An., 570;</i> Games <i>vs. </i>Hennen, 65 U.&nbsp; S., 553-631.)<br><br>In the last case the Supreme Court of the United&nbsp; States, approving the decision in the case of Abston <i>vs.</i> Abston, <i>supra,</i> said:<br><blockquote>"The court declared that&nbsp; the&nbsp; decree of a probate court ordering a will to be executed does not amount to a judgment binding&nbsp; on those who are not&nbsp; concerned&nbsp; in&nbsp; it,&nbsp; and when the&nbsp; will&nbsp; is offered&nbsp; as the title in&nbsp; virtue&nbsp; of which property&nbsp; is claimed or withheld, that its validity may be inquired into."</blockquote>A good deal of stress is laid upon the fact that Sy&nbsp; Quia was a&nbsp; Chinaman,&nbsp; and not&nbsp; a resident of the Philippine Islands, subject to the laws&nbsp; of&nbsp; Spain, and that, therefore, the descent of the property of his estate should be governed by the laws of China, where the first&nbsp; marriage took place. We are of the opinion and so hold that the question of his citizenship is of no importance.&nbsp;&nbsp; All of the property of his estate was in the Philippine Islands at&nbsp; the time of his death, both&nbsp; real and&nbsp; personal, and therefore should.be&nbsp; governed in its descent&nbsp; in accordance with&nbsp; the laws in force here. In the absence of a&nbsp; special&nbsp; contract&nbsp; between the spouses to the&nbsp; contrary, their respective&nbsp; rights&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; conjugal property will&nbsp; be governed by the <i>lex&nbsp; domicilii,</i> and not by the law of the&nbsp; place&nbsp; of&nbsp; the marriage.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; may well&nbsp; be doubted whether the spouses could control the descent of their&nbsp; property&nbsp; even&nbsp; by contract when their children&nbsp; or descendants or ascendants were the only parties interested. The record does not disclose that Sy Quia, with either wife, had made a contract at the time of entering into&nbsp; the marriage relation&nbsp; which in any way&nbsp; affected the&nbsp; descent&nbsp; or distribution of his estate. <br><br>The defendants herein&nbsp; are&nbsp; in possession pf&nbsp; their respective distributive shares of the estate of Sy Quia.&nbsp; They were given possession of it by order of the Court of First Instance of Manila, and&nbsp; it&nbsp; is to be&nbsp; presumed that&nbsp; they went into possession of the same in good faith.&nbsp; They are, therefore, not subject to&nbsp; pay interest&nbsp; or rent for the use of the same until after a judicial demand had been made by the persons who&nbsp; claimed a lawful possession.&nbsp; From that&nbsp; date,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; the defendants are liable to pay interest&nbsp; or rent upon&nbsp; that&nbsp; portion&nbsp; of the property which they possess which rightfully belongs to the plaintiffs.<br><br>From the judgment of the lower&nbsp; court both the plaintiffs and&nbsp; defendants appealed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each presented a bill&nbsp; of&nbsp; exceptions,&nbsp; together&nbsp; with numerous assignments&nbsp; of error. Each of the appellants presented most interesting and readable&nbsp; briefs.&nbsp; The&nbsp; assignments of&nbsp; error of&nbsp; the respective parties have not been&nbsp; considered&nbsp; in detail.&nbsp; We&nbsp; believe, however, that the fundamental questions which were presented by the different&nbsp; bills of exceptions and the various assignments of error have been answered in the&nbsp; foregoing opinion.<br><br>Our conclusions are,&nbsp; therefore:<br><br>First.&nbsp; That each of the wives of the said Sy&nbsp; Quia was in law a legitimate wife of the said Sy Quia and the children born of the respective wives were&nbsp; legitimate children.<br><br>Second. That as a legitimate&nbsp; wife,&nbsp; each is entitled&nbsp; to one-half&nbsp; of the conjugal property of&nbsp; the estate of the said Sy Quia.<br><br>Third. That the&nbsp; children of each wife&nbsp; are entitled&nbsp; to a proportional amount&nbsp; of&nbsp; their respective&nbsp; mother's share in said estate.<br><br>Therefore the judgment of&nbsp; the lower court should&nbsp; be hereby modified and it should be ordered and adjudged:<br><br>(<i>a</i>)&nbsp; That a judgment be entered giving the descendants of each of the respective&nbsp; wives&nbsp; one-half of the estate&nbsp; of the said&nbsp; Sy Quia.<br><br>(<i>b</i>)&nbsp; That the said defendants each render an&nbsp; account of all the property received by them respectively under the said&nbsp; judicial order of the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of the city of Manila in&nbsp; 1900.<br><br><i>(c</i>)&nbsp; That the receiver heretofore appointed By the lower court take possession of the whole estate and administer the same until the lower court can make an order&nbsp; distributing the said estate in accordance herewith.<br><br>(<i>d</i>)&nbsp; That the plaintiffs&nbsp; recover of the defendants legal interest&nbsp; on one-half&nbsp; of all the&nbsp; moneys received&nbsp; by the defendants from the said estate and&nbsp; a reasonable rent for the use and occupation of one-half&nbsp; of all the property&nbsp; of the said estate, said interest and rent to begin to run from the 4th of December, 1905.<br></y></div>
