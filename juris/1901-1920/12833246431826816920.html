				<H3>RUPERTO VENTURANZA, PETITIONER, VS. THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF BATANGAS AND RAMON CABRERA, RESPONDENTS.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MORELAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition to obtain a writ of certiorari directed to the Court of 
First Instance of Batangas to review certain proceedings had in that court in a 
contested election case involving a municipal office.
<p>It appears from the record that the applicant Venturanza was elected 
president of the municipality of Lemery, Batangas, at the elections held in June 
1916. Thereafter the respondent Ramon Cabrera instituted a protest against the 
election of Venturanza which resulted in the defeat of the latter and the 
seating of the former as municipal president. During the course of the contest 
the respondent filed a counter-protest, as he calls it, alleging certain 
irregularities and frauds in other districts than those mentioned in the 
contest. The court, on the objection of the contestant, struck out the 
counter-protest of the respondent. The contest then went to trial; evidence was 
presented by both parties; but the respondent offered no evidence relative to 
the allegations which he had made in his counter-protest.</p>
<p>The case was submitted and the decision rendered in favor of the 
contestant.</p>
<p>The proceeding in this court for certiorari is based exclusively on the act 
of the court in striking out or refusing to receive the counter-protest of the 
respondent in the contested election proceeding.</p>
<p>The case has been submitted to us upon a complaint and answer, the latter 
being of such character as to admit all of the facts necessary to decide the 
case.</p>
<p>We are of the opinion that the applicant is not entitled to the remedy prayed 
for. As we have held in so many cases (<em>In re</em> Prautch, 1 Phil. Rep., 
132; Springer <em>vs</em>. Odlin, 3 Phil. Rep., 344; Arzadon <em>vs</em>. Chanco 
and Baldueza, 14 Phil. Rep., 710; Herrera <em>vs</em>. Barretto and Joaquin, 25 
Phil. Rep., 245; Gala <em>vs</em>. Cui and Rodriguez, 25 Phil. Rep., 522; De 
Fiesta <em>vs</em>. Llorente and Manila Railroad Co., 25 Phil. Rep., 554; 
Province of Tarlac <em>vs</em>. Gale, 26 Phil. Rep., 338; Napa <em>vs</em>. 
Weissenhagen, 29 Phil. Rep., 180; Government of the P. I. <em>vs</em>. Judge of 
First Instance of Iloilo and Bantillo, 34 Phil. Rep., 157) a writ of certiorari 
will not issue to an inferior court unless that court acted without or in excess 
of its jurisdiction in performing the acts complained of. The court had 
jurisdiction of the subject-matter and the parties. It was not outside of its 
jurisdiction when it struck out the counter-protest. Its act may have been 
erroneous. As to that we do not decide; but it certainly was not an act outside 
or in excess of the jurisdiction of the court.</p>
<p>The proceeding is dismissed, with costs. So ordered.</p><em>Arellano, C. J., 
Torres</em>, and <em>Araullo, JJ.</em>, concur. <br><br><br>
<hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1">

<p>CARSON, J., concurring:</p>
<p>On the ground that the application comes too late I concur in the result.</p>
<p>TRENT, J., concurring:</p>
<p>Understanding as I do that this is a petition for a writ of certiorari and 
not mandamus, I agree with the result.</p></div>
