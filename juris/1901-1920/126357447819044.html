				<BR><STRONG>MAPA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The defendant in this case is charged with  the crime of <em>estafa</em>.  The essential part of  the charge, according to the complaint, is that the defendant secured  from one Felix Lopez a loan of 3,500 pesos by means of false statements, representations, and promises,  without which  the latter would not have made  the loan, to the  great  prejudice of the said Lopez, who had been unable to collect  the said sum up to the date of the filing of the complaint.</p>
<p>The  defendant was convicted  of the said crime in the court below and sentenced to  two years' imprisonment at hard labor, from which said judgment he appealed to this court.</p>
<p>The Attorneys Seneral in his brief sums up the facts as follows:  "The defendant, for the purpose of securing money from' Felix Lopez,  for his, the defendant's personal use, deceived the said Lopez:  (1)  ISy representing that  the transaction was made in behalf  of the estate of  Ramon Valencia, of which he was the administrator, by stating to the said Lopez that as such administrator he needed money for the support of the minor heirs of the deceased, and that he borrowed the same on account of the administration of the said  estate, knowing that such statements were false and that he was not authorized to borrow money  for  the estate, and  that he could not bind the  same; and  (2) by offering to the said Lopez, in order to induce him  to lend him the  money, hh  option for the purchase of a house belonging to the said estate when the necessary authority therefor  was secured by him, knowing  that he could  not make such a promise."</p>
<p>As to  the first point,  while we do not intend to hold that, were  the charge true,  there would be  present  the deceit which characterizes the  crime of <em>estafa</em>, as  defined and penalized in paragraph 1 of  article 585 of the Penal Code, cited by the Attorney-General as being applicable to the case at bar, there is no evidence that would justify  the Attorney-General's conclusion.  The only thing that Lopez, according to his own statement, was told by the accused in reference to the matter was this:  <em>"The minors have asked me for money for  their support, and  I have no money behniffiny to the estate, under my administration  and he (the defendant) voluntarily  promised to pay  interest at the, rate of ten per cent."</em>   The two promissory notes, one for 500 and the other for 3,000 pesos, contain the statement that the  defendant borrowed the money as the judicial administrator  of the estate of the deceased, Roman Valencia, to pay the expenses incurred in the course of administration.  Neither verbally, nor by means of the said promissory  notes, did the accused state to the said Felix Lopez that he, the accused, Avas authorized to borrow money  for the estate,  or that the said estate  would be liable  for  the money so borrowed,  if Lopez so understood it, it was  his own fault, for the defendant told him nothing; that could create such an impression in his mind.  And further it has not been satisfactorily shown  that the statements made by the defendant to the said Lopez were false.  The only thing the defendant really told him was that he had not sufficient money  belonging to the estate to meet the  demands for money of the heirs of  the deceased Ramon Valencia.   The conversation in  reference to this  matter took place before the loans were secured, on the 2d and 5th of December, 1902.   The defendant was  appointed administrator of the estate on the 17th of October of that year, and up to the said month of December lie had only collected as revenues of the estate the sum of 200 pesos.  However, in the month of December he had already  paid  to  the widow of Ramon  Valencia, one of the parties interested in the estate, with  the  authority of the court,  the  sum  of 1,260 pesos, as shown by the  accounts appearing on pages 46,  53, and 54 of the record.  Therefore it may  be that what the defendant told Lopez when he negotiated these loans on  the dates aforesaid was true, particularly because, as has already been said,  there is no affirmative  proof  to the contrary.</p>
<p>Whether the defendant did or did not, as a matter of fact, apply all the money borrowed from Lopez to  the expenses of the estate,  assuming that he borrowed that money  for this particular purpose, is not necessary for us to inquire, in view of the fact that all this took place subsequent to the borrowing of the money; and whatever opinion might be entertained as to the conduct of the defendant in  connection with this  matter, assuming that the charge is true, it can not be said that his acts  constituted a  deceit in order to obtain the money,  for it is obvious that in  order to be considered as  such, it should be prior to, or simultaneous with the  loanâ€”we refer to the deceit, that is to say, the fiction or representation alleged to be deceitful.</p>
<p>As to the second point,  namely, that the promise made by the defendant to Lopez to give him preference  in the event that he should be duly authorized to sell the house on Calle Arlegui,  if they agreed on the price1, this also seems to have been made subsequent to the borrowing of the money. It at least may be so inferred from the following extract from the testimony of Lopez :</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Q.  Have  you ever  had a  conversation with him (the accused) <em>since</em> the loan was made?</p>
  <p>"A.  The only conversation we had was that  when  he secured the necessary  authority  he  would sell the house, giving me  preference  in  the  sale if I wished to buy  it, and we could agree on the price."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This, together with  the fact that nowhere  in his testimony did Lopez say that this conversation took place before the money was loaned, seems to  clearly indicate that the conversation occurred after  the  loan was  made,  for the word <em>since</em> which  appears in the question  to Lopez refers to a time subsequent to the loan.</p>
<p>In any event, it seems to us that the assertion made  by the Attorney-General in  his brief  to the  effect  that the defendant knew very well that he could not make such a promise, is doubtful and questionable.  Section 722 of the Omlo of Procedure in Civil Actions provides, in paragraph 5  thereof, that the court may authorize the  executor  or administrator of an estate to sell "such part of the estate as is deemed necessary, either at public or <em>private sale</em>, as would be most beneficial to all parties concerned  *  *  *," and we know of no provision  of law which expressly prohibits the administrator,  in case the property is  sold  at private sale, to give preference, under the same conditions, to a particular purchaser.</p>
<p>The judgment of the court below is accordingly hereby reversed, and the  defendant  acquitted, with the costs  of both instances de ofivio.   After the expiration of ten days let judgment be entered  in accordance herewith and the case be remanded  to the  court below for  execution.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C.J.,  Torres, Johnson, Carson, Willard,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ., </em>concur.<br>
