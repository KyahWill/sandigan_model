				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Froilan Benavente, who&nbsp; was engaged in&nbsp; the business of sawing timber, employed several laborers in this work and used to permit some of them to pass the night in a part of his house which he called the dining&nbsp; room, which was separated by a partition from the rest of the house and could be entered through&nbsp; a door&nbsp; opened in the dividing wall.&nbsp;&nbsp; Luciano Barberan was one of the said laborers and, prior to the occasion&nbsp; of the crime prosecuted in this case, had also&nbsp; slept in that part&nbsp; of&nbsp; the house, but about a week before had gone to his&nbsp; mother's home in the sitio of Ygan, to sleep there.&nbsp; It happened that on May 6,&nbsp; 1909, Froilan Benavente&nbsp; had occasion to absent himself&nbsp; from his house, and that on the&nbsp; morning of that day Barberan had been in it.&nbsp; That night&nbsp; Benavente's&nbsp; wife, and one of his daughters who was very young,&nbsp; remained in the house, accompanied only by a nephew of his, named Celestino Basco, and at the customary&nbsp; hour&nbsp; they&nbsp; retired for the night to the room which was separated, as aforesaid, from&nbsp; the dining room, and&nbsp; barred the door&nbsp; communicating with&nbsp; the latter, as well as all the windows of the house. At about 1&nbsp; o'clock that night Basco, hearing a noise, awoke his aunt, saying that he&nbsp; believed that&nbsp; there&nbsp; was&nbsp; some stranger in the room. By the light which Basco had lit they saw a man&nbsp; hiding&nbsp; behind a column&nbsp; who,&nbsp; on being held by Benavente's wife,&nbsp; gave her a push and escaped through the same window&nbsp; by which he&nbsp; had entered&nbsp; and which had&nbsp; been&nbsp; left&nbsp; partly open.&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp; window, like&nbsp; all the others of the room, was in&nbsp; the outer wall of the house, about 8 varas from the ground.&nbsp; The defendant, climbing over the fence which inclosed the lower part of the house, raised himself to the window, which&nbsp; was fastened by a transverse piece of wood.<br><blockquote>"It appears that&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant made&nbsp; use&nbsp; of&nbsp; a weapon to open&nbsp; that window by applying it to&nbsp; the&nbsp; ends of both sections, which were joined, and, as the&nbsp; window bolt was half&nbsp; worn-out, he was&nbsp; able to raise&nbsp; it&nbsp; and thus opened the window, breaking the bolt; that is to say, between the crack in the wall of the&nbsp; house&nbsp; and the edge of the window a mark was seen which&nbsp; was left by some instrument used to raise the window catch (pp.&nbsp; 23 and 24 of the record)."</blockquote>The preceding facts were proved.<br><br>The only argument offered&nbsp; by the&nbsp; defense is that the defendant did not forcibly enter a house&nbsp; in which he was in the habit of sleeping and considered as his own home.<br><br>But the place through which&nbsp; he entered&nbsp; was not a proper entrance to the house, and he&nbsp; did climb up into&nbsp; the house as any stranger might have done who had&nbsp; conceived the same purpose as did&nbsp; the defendant.&nbsp; Moreover, not because he had been authorized&nbsp; to occasionally pass&nbsp; the night in the dining room, was he also authorized stealthily to enter; not the dining room, but the apartment&nbsp; reserved for the family, the&nbsp; doors&nbsp; and windows of which were&nbsp; all closed that night.<br><blockquote>"The fact that the defendant," concludes the trial judge, "entered in&nbsp; this manner&nbsp; at a late hour of the night, when all the inmates of that house were asleep, clearly establishes the fact that he entered against the will of the occupants."</blockquote>The crime committed falls squarely within the provisions of article 491, paragraph 2, Penal Code.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was perpetrated with violence, this word&nbsp; being&nbsp; understood in the sense already established in the reported cases.&nbsp; (U. S. <i>vs.</i> Clauck, 6 Phil. Rep., 486,&nbsp; and decisions&nbsp; of the supreme court&nbsp; of Spain of April 5, 1890, and February 8,1899.)<br><br>Two aggravating circumstances were taken into account by the trial court, to wit, that of the crime&nbsp; having been executed&nbsp; at&nbsp; night, and by scaling a wall.&nbsp; But&nbsp; this last circumstance, in the present case, is the specific and essential element of the forcible entry itself, so that it&nbsp; must not be considered as an additional&nbsp; circumstance&nbsp; of&nbsp; the crime. However,&nbsp; its omission does not modify the degree of the penalty imposed by the judgment.<br><br>Hence,&nbsp; the&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from, which sentences Luciano Barberan to four years nine&nbsp; months&nbsp; and eleven days of <i>prision&nbsp; correccional</i>, to the payment of a&nbsp; fine of 2,500 pesetas,&nbsp; or, in case of insolvency, to&nbsp; the equivalent subsidiary imprisonment, to the accessory penalties of article 61, Penal Code, and to pay the costs, is hereby affirmed. The appellant shall&nbsp; also pay the&nbsp; costs of&nbsp; this&nbsp; instance. So ordered.<br><br><i>Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson,</i> and&nbsp; <i>Moreland, JJ.</i>, concur.<br></div>
