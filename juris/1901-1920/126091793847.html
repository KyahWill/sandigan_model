				G.R. No. 2300, January 22, 1906</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. ANTONIO ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Antonio Mallari, Juan  Salas, Maximo  Salas  (alias Temo), Ambrosio de los Reyes, Oamilo Mercado, Eusebio Peliciano, and Severo Panlilio, the appellants in this case, were charged with the  crime of "robbery  in  an armed band," and were convicted of the  simple crime of robbery, as defined and penalized in paragraph 5  of article 503 of the Penal Code.</p>
<p>Juan Salas and  Camilo  Mercado having  died pending their appeal to this  court, the complaint as to them should be dismissed, with  their proportionate part  of  the costs de oficio.</p>
<p>We find no error in the  proceedings prejudicial to the rights of the appellants, and the  evidence adduced at the trial establishes  their guilt of the crime  with which they were charged beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>We are of opinion, however, that the accused having been charged with  "robbery  in an armed band," and it having  been  proven that the robbery was  in  fact committed  by  an armed  band, the  penalty  imposed should have been the maximum degree of the penalty of "<em>presidio correccional</em> to <em>presidio mayor</em> in its  medium degree" in accordance with  the provisions of article  504 of the Penal Codeâ€”that is to  say,  from eight  years eight months and eleven days to ten years of  <em>presidio mayor</em>.</p>
<p>We therefore reverse the judgment and sentence of the trial court and find the appellants, except the said Juan Salas and Camilo Mercado, deceased, guilty as charged of the crime of "robbery in an armed band,"  with the aggravating circumstance  of  having committed the offense at night and in the house of the person robbed, and with the further aggravating  circumstance as to the appellants Maximo Salas, Severo Panlilio, and Ambrosio de los Reyes that they took advantage in the commission of the offense of their official position as municipal policemen, and we sentence the said Antonio  Mallari, Maximo  Salas (<em>alias</em> Temo),  Ambrosio de  los Reyes,  Eusebio Feliciano, and Severo Panlilio and each of them to ten  years' imprisonment (<em>presidio mayor</em>)  with  the  accessory penalties prescribed by law, to the payment respectively of one-ninth of  the  costs  of  the proceedings in both instances,  and jointly and severally to the return of  the stolen property or  to  the indemnification of the  persons from  whom  it was taken in the sum  of  P727, Philippine currency.   So ordered.</p>
<p>Ar<em>ellano, C. J., Mapa,  Johnson,</em> and  <em>Willard, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
