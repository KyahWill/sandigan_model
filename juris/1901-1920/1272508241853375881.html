				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, <I>VS.</I> TOMAS MACABABBAG AND MARIA BALISI,  DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">These defendants were charged with the crime of <i>amancebamiento</i>.&nbsp; The complaint&nbsp; alleged: "That on or about, and&nbsp; for some five months prior to, July 11, 1914, in the municipality of Tuguegarao, Province of Cagayan,&nbsp; P. I., the said Tomas Macababbag, being legally married to Dominga Bulaqui, did willfully, unlawfully, and criminally, with gross insult to and contempt of the latter, take into the conjugal home and there keep the other accused, Maria Balisi, as his mistress,&nbsp; with scandal to the public and in violation of the law."<br><br>Upon the said&nbsp; complaint the defendants were duly arrested, arraigned, tried, found guilty of the crime charged, and sentenced in&nbsp; accordance with the provisions of article 437 of the Penal Code.&nbsp; Tomas Macababbag was sentenced to be imprisoned for a period of two years and four months of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision&nbsp; correctional</span>, and&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay one-half the&nbsp; costs. Maria Basili was sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>destierro</i> for a period of two years and four months, and during that period to remain away from the center&nbsp; of the municipality of&nbsp; Tuguegarao, and not to&nbsp; come nearer than&nbsp; a distance&nbsp; of 25 kilometers, and to pay one-half the&nbsp; costs. From that sentence each of the defendants appealed to this court.<br><br>While&nbsp; the appellants make&nbsp; no&nbsp; specific assignments of error, they argue&nbsp; that the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause was insufficient to show that they are guilty of the crime charged.&nbsp; The appellants argue&nbsp; that "according to the&nbsp; provisions of article 437 of the Penal Code, no crime&nbsp; is committed, unless the acts&nbsp; alleged&nbsp; to have&nbsp; been committed&nbsp; were committed under scandalous circumstances."&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; appellants argue&nbsp; that&nbsp; there was no public scandal connected with the commission of the crime charged in the present case. The appellants, however, have not carefully read said article 437.&nbsp; A married man who keeps a mistress in his conjugal dwelling is guilty of the&nbsp; crime of concubinage.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Scandalous circumstances" are not necessary to.make him&nbsp; guilty of&nbsp; said crime.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is only&nbsp; when the mistress is kept elsewhere that "scandalous&nbsp; circumstances" become&nbsp; an&nbsp; element&nbsp; of&nbsp; the crime.&nbsp; We&nbsp; find no reason for modifying the sentence of the lower court after a careful examination&nbsp; of the evidence brought here.&nbsp; The same is, therefore, hereby affirmed, with costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Carson, Trent,</i> and&nbsp; <i>Araullo, JJ.,</i> concur.<br></div>
