				G.R. No. 1560, March 21, 1904</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE, VS. BERNABE GOMEZ, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The defendant was charged with the falsification of a vehicle
license and was convicted of the offense of using the altered license
in court, knowing that it had been changed.
<p>The altered license was presented at the trial of a criminal case in
the municipal court of Manila for the purpose of showing that this
defendant had a license for the vehicle. But there is no evidence in
this case that the defendant here was a party to the criminal case in
the municipal court. On the contrary it seems that the defendant in
that case was the cochero of this defendant. Nor is there any evidence
that the defendant in this case was present at the trial in the
municipal court or ever took any part therein or ever saw the license
in its original or altered form or knew that it had been altered or
ever authorized anyone to present the altered license in the trial
before the municipal court.</p>
<p>The judgment of the court below is reversed and the defendant acquitted with costs <em>de oficio.</em></p>
<p><em>Arellano, C, J., Torres, Cooper, Mapa,</em> and <em>McDonough, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em>Johnson, J.</em>, did not sit in this case.</p>
