				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The Chinese firm of Hieng Cheong Shing was organized for the, purpose of fraudulently importing goods  into the Philippine Islands without payment of the lawful duties  thereon.  The defendant  was a member of that  firm from the date of its organization.  On the 25th of August, 1903, he made the declaration required by law at the  custom-house for the entry of certain goods imported by the firm of which he was a member.  The invoice which he  presented with the declaration stated that three packages  contained imitation  butter.  This  statement  was false,  the packages in question  containing aniseed  oil  and pearl buttons.   The entry was allowed, the duties were paid on the goods as imitation butter, and they were delivered to the defendant's firm.   The duties on aniseed oil and  buttons  were  much  higher  at  that time  than on imitation butter.  The principal claim  of the defendant is that he did not know that the declaration which  he signed  and the invoice which he  presented were  false,  and that he supposed that the invoice and declaration correctly stated the character  Of the goods.  The evidence upon this point is in our opinion,  sufficient to sustain the conviction. That the firm was engaged in the business of fraudulently importing goods in violation of the customs  laws was  conclusively proved, and it was also proved that the defendant, when arrested, pointed out to the officers the place where the buttons were to be found.</p>
<p>The defendant  was prosecuted for a violation of section 017 of Act No. 355.  That section is in part as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"If  any  owner, importer,  consignee,  agent, or other person shall make or attempt to make any entry, of imported  *   *  *  merchandise by means of any false or fraudulent  invoice,  affidavit,  letter, paper,  or  by means of any false statement, written or verbal, or by means of any false or fraudulent practice or appliance whatsoever, or shall be guilty of any willful act or omission by means whereof the Government of the Philippine Islands shall be deprived  of the lawful duties, or any portion  thereof, embraced or referred to in such invoice, affidavit, letter, paper, or statement, or affected by such act or omission, *  * * such person  shall, upon conviction, be fined for each offense a sum not exceeding five thousand dollars, or be, imprisoned for a time not exceeding two years, or both, in the discretion of the  court."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The complaint in this case  charged  the defendant  with the  crime of making an entry of  imported dutiable  merchandise by means of  a  false  and fraudulent invoice.  It then alleged that the defendant imported from Hongkong certain merchandise, a  part  of which  was  declared  as imitation butter, and that the said declaration was false and fraudulent.  It is claimed by the defendant that the crime  of  which the defendant is  accused is that of the importation of goods by  means of a false invoice, whereas the complaint itself declares that the declaration was false and fraudulent.  There was evidence in the  case to show that the invoice always accompanied the declaration; that the declaration would not be received without the invoice, and that they were parts of one document.   This claim of the defendant can not, therefore,  be sustained.</p>
<p>The court below sentenced the defendant to confinement in the prison of Bilibid for six months and to pay a fine of 1,000 pesos, it being provided in the  judgment that if the fine was not paid  the  defendant should  suffer corresponding additional imprisonment until the fine was satisfied  at the rate of one day for each 1½ pesos.</p>
<p>The Solicitor-General in  his brief suggests that the subsidiary imprisonment  is not  justified by  the law.  The Customs Administrative  Act,  No. 355, took effect in Manila on February 7, 1902.  Section 291 of that act authorized subsidiary imprisonment on  nonpayment  of fines imposed  in criminal prosecutions under  the act, such imprisonment to be regulated  by the provisions  of  the Penal Code.  Act No. 653 took effect on March 4, 1903. This  act provided  for subsidiary imprisonment on  the nonpayment of fines at the rate of not less than 20 cents, United States money, per  day, the rate to be fixed in  the judgment.   This act was in force when the offense  in this case was committed on the 25th of August, 1903.   As we construe this act, it related exclusively to fines imposed by  the administrative officers, either by the collectors of the various ports throughout the Islands or by the Insular Collector, and did not in any way  relate to fines imposed by  the courts for violation of the criminal features of  the law.  It did not repeal section 291  of  Act No. 355,  expressly,  and we hold that it was not repealed by implication ;  so  that at the time the criminal act in this case was committed the subsidiary  imprisonment which could  be imposed for nonpayment of a fine was  regulated  by  the Penal Code.</p>
<p>Article 50 of the Penal Code provides, in part, as follows;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"ART.  50. If the person sentenced should not have property to satisfy the  pecuniary liabilities included in numbers one, three, and five of the preceding article, he shall be subject to a subsidiary personal liability at the rate of one day  for every twelve and one-half pesetas,  according to the following rules:</p>
  <p>"(1)  If the principal penalty imposed is to be undergone by the criminal confined in  a penal institution, he shall continue therein, although said  detention can not exceed one-third of the  term of the sentence, and in no case can it exceed one year."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Act No. 864 took effect on September 2, 1903, after the offense in  this case had been committed.  This act  expressly repealed section 291  of Act No. 355 and in other parts  of the act subsidiary imprisonment was provided for in case of the nonpayment  of fines, at the rate of not less than 40  centavos a day, the  exact rate to be fixed  in the decision  of the court.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to decide, and we do  not decide, whether the fines referred to in this act are administrative fines  or  whether they include also fines like the one in question in this case  imposed by the court as a punishment for a  crime, for in no event can the act be made applicable to this offense which was committed before its  passage. The imprisonment imposed by this act as is seen is much more  severe than that  provided  for  in the  Penal Code. In accordance with the  provisions of the Penal Code, and section 291, above quoted, the rate must have been 2£ pesos per day while under  Act No. 864 it might be as low as 40 centavos.  Under the Penal Code in  no event could the subsidiary imprisonment exceed one-third of the principal penalty.   In this case  if the  penalty  were imposed  in accordance  with  section 291  the  defendant could not  be imprisoned for more  than four months for nonpayment of the fine,  but under Act No. 864 there is no limitation of that character and at the rate of  1£ pesos a day he could be imprisoned for nearly two years.</p>
<p>Section 5 of the act of Congress of July 1,1902, provides, "that no <em>ex post facto</em> law or bill of attainder  shall  be enacted."  This  provision relates exclusively to criminal cases.  Act No. 864 is, so far as the offense in this case is concerned, an <em>ex post facto</em> law  and therefore  null and void  in  relation  thereto.  The  defendant  can  not  be punished in accordance with this law.</p>
<p>When  section 291, above referred to, was repealed by Act No.  864, no  clause was inserted therein relating  to offenses theretofore  committed and as to which  no  final judgment had been rendered.   It was nowhere provided in the law  that as  to  those offenses the  prior law should continue in force, but section 291 was  repealed absolutely.</p>
<p>The judgment was entered in this case in February, 1904. At that time said section 291 was not in force, nor was there  then in  force  any valid law by  which subsidiary imprisonment  could  be  imposed upon this  defendant for nonpayment of the fine.   The part of the judgment imposing such subsidiary imprisonment was not warranted by the law and the judgment is modified by striking it out. In all other respects the judgment of the court below is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.   At the expiration of ten days after the date  of final judgment the case will be remanded to the lower court for proper action.   So  ordered.</p>
