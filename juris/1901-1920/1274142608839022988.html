				G.R. No. 1896, December 23, 1904</h4>
				<H3>The United States, plaintiff and appellee, vs. Pedro Trincio, defendant and appellant.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This case came before the court on a motion by the Solicitor-General to 
dismiss the appeal for the reason that it had not been perfected within the time 
prescribed by section 47 of General Orders, No. 58.
<p>Section 47 of General Orders, No. 58, provides: "An appeal must be taken 
within fifteen days from the rendition of the judgment or order appealed 
from."</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from was rendered by the Court of First Instance of the 
city of Manila on the 17th day of August, 1903.</p>
<p>On the 10th day of August, 1903, the defendant and appellant presented a 
motion for a new trial.</p>
<p>On the 2d day of October, 1903: the judge who rendered the sentence in said 
cause denied the motion for a new trial, for the reason that the motion had not 
complied with the requirements of section 42 of General Orders, No. 58.</p>
<p>On the 5th day of October, 1903, the defendant and appellant filed with the 
said Court of First Instance his notice of appeal. The judgment was rendered on 
the 17th day of August, 1903. The appeal was taken on the 5th day of October, 
1903. More than fifteen days had elapsed from the rendition of the judgment 
appealed from and the time the appeal was taken.</p>
<p>This court has decided in two different cases (United States <em>vs.</em> 
Flemister, 1 Phil. Rep., 317; United States <em>vs.</em> Perez, 1 Phil. Rep., 
322) that the pendency of a motion for a new trial does not extend the time for 
taking an appeal beyond the fifteen days after the judgment provided for in the 
above-quoted section 47.</p>
<p>By the said decisions in the causes of the United States <em>vs</em>. 
Flemister and the United States vs. Perez, the following rules are 
established:</p>
<p>(1) That appeals in criminal cases will not be allowed after the lapse of 
fifteen days from the rendition of the judgment Or order appealed from.</p>
<p>(2) That the pendency of a motion for a new trial does not extend the time to 
perfect an appeal.</p>
<p>(3) That the motion for a new trial fails, ipso facto, if the judge neglects 
or fails to decide the same within the said fifteen days.</p>
<p>The motion to dismiss said appeal is hereby granted.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa,</em> and <em>Carson, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
