				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The defendants in this case, Benito Paraiso, Isidoro Delin and Clemente Delin,&nbsp; were accused of the crime of murder. The complaint alleges that on or about the 24th&nbsp; day of May,&nbsp; 1908,&nbsp; within the jurisdiction of the town of Barili, Province of Cebu,&nbsp; the said defendants, with treachery and known premeditation, wounded Severino Manigos with bolos, causing the instantaneous death of the said&nbsp; Manigos. The Court of First Instance of Cebu found Benito Paraiso and Isidoro&nbsp; Delin guilty&nbsp; as&nbsp; principals of the crime of homicide,&nbsp; and sentenced each of them&nbsp; to seventeen years four months and twenty-one&nbsp; days of <i>reclusion temporal,</i> together&nbsp; with the corresponding accessory&nbsp; penalties,&nbsp; and Clemente Delin to eight years of <i>prision mayor</i>, as an accomplice, also to the accessory penalties.&nbsp; These defendants were further condemned to indemnify, jointly and severally, the family of the deceased&nbsp; in the sum of P500, and to pay the costs.&nbsp; From this sentence the defendants appealed, but Clemente Delin and Isidoro Delin withdrew their appeals and are now serving the sentence imposed&nbsp; upon them by the court below.<br><br>The prosecution presented two witnesses, Marcos Campaña&nbsp; and Claro&nbsp; Ababa.&nbsp; The defense examined Isidoro Delin and&nbsp; Clemente&nbsp; Delin, two of the&nbsp; accused.&nbsp; Marcos Campaña testified that he knew the three accused and the deceased; that the deceased was a very old man who walked by supporting himself with a cane; that between the hours of&nbsp; 7&nbsp; and 8&nbsp; o'clock&nbsp; on the&nbsp; night&nbsp; of the&nbsp; 24th&nbsp; of May, 1908,&nbsp; in&nbsp; the barrio&nbsp; of&nbsp; Montalangan, in the municipality of Barili, Province of Cebu, he heard the defendants say, when they were a short distance from his house: "Where is our enemy?"&nbsp;&nbsp; That on hearing this he looked through an opening in the side of his house and saw the three accused, Clemente Delin in front carrying a torchlight, Benito Paraiso about two brazas behind Clemente, Isidoro Delin about one braza behind Paraiso; that these defendants met the old man, Severino Manigos, just in front of his (witness's) house, and on meeting him there Benito Paraiso said: "You are my enemy," then struck&nbsp; him with a bolo; that immediately after the deceased was struck by Paraiso, Isidoro Delin struck the old man with the same&nbsp; kind of weapon; that Manigos fell to the ground and died immediately as a result&nbsp; of&nbsp; these blows;&nbsp; that the defendants then&nbsp; went to the door of the <i>tienda </i>of Claro Ababa, which was just in front and about four brazas distant from his (witness's) house;&nbsp; that&nbsp; the defendants,&nbsp; after leaving the&nbsp; house of Claro Ababa, entered the cockpit which was very near by, looked around inside the same, and then went to the&nbsp; body of the&nbsp; deceased and examined it; that on&nbsp; examination one of them remarked: <i>"Caramba! </i>&nbsp; This is an old man." <br><br>Claro Ababa, the other witness presented by the Government, corroborated in all its material&nbsp; parts the testimony given by Marcos Campaña.&nbsp; This witness testified that it was about 10&nbsp; o'clock&nbsp; on that night&nbsp; when Manigos was killed by Benito Paraiso and Isidoro Delin; that when this trouble occurred, just in front of his store, his <i>tienda </i>was open but that he immediately closed the door; that after the defendants had struck the old man twice&nbsp; with their bolos and he having fallen to the ground, they came to the&nbsp; door of his&nbsp; store and began to&nbsp; strike&nbsp; blows on&nbsp; the said&nbsp; door with their bolos; that after leaving his store they entered the cockpit and then returned to the body&nbsp; of the deceased; that he examined the body of the deceased&nbsp; on the following day and saw the two severe wounds, the&nbsp; deceased having been disemboweled by one of said wounds.<br><br>The two accused, Clemente Delin and Isidoro Delin, presented as witnesses for the defense, testified that they took no part in the killing of Severino Manigos; that they were not there on that night; that they knew absolutely nothing of this killing; and that they did not know, nor were they acquainted with the deceased.<br><br>The&nbsp; two witnesses presented by the Government&nbsp; were eyewitnesses to this killing; they were well acquainted with the defendants and deceased before&nbsp; this trouble occurred. On the night in&nbsp; question&nbsp; they&nbsp; had a good opportunity to recognize the defendants, as the killing occurred very close to&nbsp; their houses and&nbsp; under such&nbsp; circumstances&nbsp; that&nbsp; their attention was directed to&nbsp; the identity of&nbsp; the persons who committed the deed.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; is true that one&nbsp; of these witnesses&nbsp; stated that the killing occurred between 7 and&nbsp; 8 o'clock&nbsp; on the night&nbsp; of the&nbsp; 24th&nbsp; of&nbsp; May, while the other witness testified that it occurred&nbsp; about 10 o'clock on that night.&nbsp; We are of the opinion that this discrepancy&nbsp; as to the hour&nbsp; is not material.&nbsp; The attention of&nbsp; these witnesses was&nbsp; not called&nbsp; or&nbsp; directed to the&nbsp; hour&nbsp; when this occurred.&nbsp; The principal thing which concerned them&nbsp; at the time was&nbsp; the killing of this&nbsp; old man.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is immaterial whether this killing took place between&nbsp; the&nbsp; hours&nbsp; of&nbsp; 7 and 8 or at 10 o'clock.&nbsp; This would&nbsp; not&nbsp; change the fact that the deceased&nbsp; was killed at&nbsp; that place on&nbsp; the night of the 24th of May.<br><br>There can not be the slightest doubt that the deceased died as a direct result of the wounds inflicted by Benito Paraiso and Isidoro Delin&nbsp; on&nbsp; the night of May 24.&nbsp; Either one&nbsp; of these&nbsp; wounds would alone have caused the&nbsp; immediate death of Severino Manigos.&nbsp;&nbsp; The deceased was&nbsp; a very decrepit old man, and was&nbsp; walking quietly along&nbsp; the street, aided by his cane, when he was suddenly attacked by these armed defendants.&nbsp;&nbsp; He had absolutely no opportunity to either defend himself or make his escape, the attack being sudden and without warning.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was,&nbsp; under these circumstances, perfectly defenseless.&nbsp; This appellant and his&nbsp; companions were&nbsp; in&nbsp; no danger whatever of&nbsp; bodily harm when&nbsp; they attacked this&nbsp; old&nbsp; man.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact&nbsp; that the deceased had a cane does not in any manner change&nbsp; the&nbsp; nature of this crime inasmuch&nbsp; as&nbsp; it was&nbsp; necessary for him to use this cane when walking.&nbsp; He was not carrying it for the purpose of&nbsp; defending himself&nbsp; and was not expecting&nbsp; any attack, as&nbsp; there did not exist any reasons whatsoever for him to have the slightest fear or intimation that he was going to be attacked on that night.<br><br>The complaint in&nbsp; this case charged the defendants with the crime of assassination, in that they,&nbsp; with treachery and known premeditation, caused the death of Severino Manigos by&nbsp; means of bolos.&nbsp; In order to&nbsp; raise this crime&nbsp; from homicide&nbsp; to&nbsp; assassination one of these&nbsp; qualifying circumstances must have&nbsp; been present.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; circumstance of known premeditation did not exist, but we are clearly of the opinion that the qualifying circumstance of treachery (<i>alevosia</i>) has been&nbsp; established.<br><br>No. 2 of article 10 of the Penal Code provides as follows:<br><blockquote><center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></center><br>"There is treachery&nbsp; when the culprit&nbsp; commits any crime against persons,&nbsp; employing means,&nbsp; methods, or&nbsp; forms in the execution thereof which tend to directly and specially insure it without risk to the person of the criminal arising from the defense the injured party might make,"<br></blockquote>In the case at bar, as we have said, the appellant and his two companions&nbsp; were armed with deadly weapons.&nbsp;&nbsp; The deceased was a defenseless old man. The attack was sudden, resulting in the instantaneous death of Manigos, without giving him any opportunity to defend himself or make his&nbsp; escape,&nbsp; the&nbsp; culprits thereby&nbsp; employing means in the execution&nbsp; of this crime which insured&nbsp; them&nbsp; against&nbsp; any risk of personal injury from the deceased, Severino Manigos, and treacherously taking the life of the said Manigos.&nbsp; (U. S. <i>vs.</i> Angel, 4 Phil. Rep., 295; U. S. <i>vs</i>. Canaman, 9 Phil. Rep., 121; U. S. <i>vs.</i> Matanug, 11 Phil. Rep., 188.) The trial court found that the aggravating circumstance of nocturnity was present in the commission of this crime. Such&nbsp; application, however, can not be made, inasmuch as it has&nbsp; not been shown that&nbsp; the defendants intentionally sought the cover of darkness for the purpose of committing this murder.&nbsp; They were going&nbsp; along the&nbsp; street carrying a light of sufficient brilliance to make it&nbsp; easy for people near by to recognize them.&nbsp;&nbsp; (U. S.<i> vs.</i> Ramos, 2 Phil. Rep., 434.)&nbsp;&nbsp; No modifying&nbsp; circumstances&nbsp; have been&nbsp; established in this&nbsp; case.<br><br>The judgment appealed from is, therefore, reversed,&nbsp; and the&nbsp; defendant Benito&nbsp; Paraiso is&nbsp; found guilty of the crime of murder and sentenced to <span style="font-style: italic;">cadena perpetua</span> (that is, to life imprisonment in the Insular Penitentiary),&nbsp; to the accessory penalties,&nbsp; to indemnify the heirs of the deceased jointly&nbsp; and severally&nbsp; with&nbsp; the other&nbsp; two defendants&nbsp; in the&nbsp; sum of P1,000, and to pay one-third of the costs of this cause.<br><br><i> Arellano,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J.,&nbsp; Torres,&nbsp; Johnson, </i>and <i> Moreland, </i> JJ., concur.<br></div>
