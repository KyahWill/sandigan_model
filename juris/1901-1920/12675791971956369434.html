				<BR><BR><p></p><div align="justify">The subject matter of this case&nbsp; is robbery in a dwelling with force upon things, but without violence against persons. The force consisted in break down the wall of the kitchen so that one&nbsp; of the&nbsp; malefactors&nbsp; could get into&nbsp; the shop while the others were outside.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; was Juan&nbsp; Morada who entered the shop to get, as he did,&nbsp; coin&nbsp; amounting to P20 and various articles such as&nbsp; cans of salmon and sardines, rice, penknives, a razor and comb, all together worth P31.80 and not recovered, excepting some worth P1.17.&nbsp;&nbsp; The owner of the shop, the Chinese Iyong, awoke and caught up a stick, but as he did so some things&nbsp; fell and&nbsp; made a noise, so Morada fl The Chinese called to his aid Estanislao Cabiguin, but&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter was a watching what, was happening and succeeded in seeing Morada&nbsp; and the other defendants, the former in&nbsp; the act of robbery and all afterwards fleeing.&nbsp; They all carried sticks.&nbsp;&nbsp; This took&nbsp; place in the early&nbsp; morning December 24, 1911.<p>The next day a penknife, a can of sardines,&nbsp; and&nbsp; another of salmon were found in the possession of Librado Sugcay, who voluntarily confessed to municipal police sergeant of Mambajao, the scene of&nbsp; the occurrence, and through him the other&nbsp; defendants were soon discovered.</p><p>Evidence&nbsp; of alibi&nbsp; having&nbsp; been&nbsp; rejected&nbsp; and proof&nbsp; of conviction being well established, the Court of First Instance of Misamis&nbsp; classified the simple robbery,&nbsp; but found against&nbsp; all the defendants the generic aggravating circumstances&nbsp; of nocturnity&nbsp; and&nbsp; a gang, and&nbsp; moreover against Juan Morada, Isidoro Babano, and Librado Sugcay that of previous conviction, and against Gil Revilla that of vagrancy, sentencing the firs to&nbsp; seven years&nbsp; of <em>presidio&nbsp; mayor,</em>&nbsp; and&nbsp; the latter to six years one day of the same penalty and all four&nbsp; to the accessories of article 5 restitution of the articles&nbsp; not recovered&nbsp; or indemnity for their value payment of a proportional&nbsp; part of the costs.</p><p>Isidoro&nbsp; Babano and Gil Revilla appealed from this judgment,&nbsp; while Morada&nbsp; and Sugcay submitted&nbsp; to it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, Babano withdrew his appeal to this court.</p><p>With reference to the facts, no error is alleged that can alter the conclusion the trial court.</p><p>As for&nbsp; the law,&nbsp; the present appeal&nbsp; is only maintained by Gil Revilla, has been sentenced to six years and one day of <em>presidio mayor,</em> as of&nbsp; robbery with force upon&nbsp; things penalized&nbsp; in paragraph 3 of article of the Penal&nbsp; Code.&nbsp; This&nbsp; paragraph 3 provides that when the malefactors are armed, but the value of the things stolen does not exceed 1,250 <em>&nbsp; pesetas</em>, as&nbsp; in the&nbsp; present case, there shall be imposed the penalty lower than that imposed in&nbsp; paragraph&nbsp; 1, which is <em>presidio mayor</em> medium degree to <em>cadena temporal</em> in its minimum degree.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Presidio correctional</span> in&nbsp; its medium degree being next lower than&nbsp; <em>presidio mayor</em> in its minimum degree, according to rule 4 of article 75, it appears that court imposed the penalty in its maximum degree, because&nbsp; of the twenty third and fifteenth&nbsp; aggravating circumstances&nbsp; that is, because the par convicted was a vagabond&nbsp; and had&nbsp; committed the crime at night and in a gang, holding this last circumstance to be merely a generic aggravating one.</p><p>It did not think applicable article 509 which penalizes qualified robbery because,&nbsp; according to&nbsp; its&nbsp; interpretation, the robbery is&nbsp; qualified when committed in an uninhabited&nbsp; place and in a gang,&nbsp; these two&nbsp; qualifications concurring, which&nbsp; does&nbsp; not happen in the present case, for it does not appear that the house wherein the robbery was perpetrated was located in an uninhabited place.</p><p>It is true that, under the Penal&nbsp; Code of the Philippines, robbery&nbsp; with upon things, in order to be qualified, must be committed in an uninhabited place <em>and</em> in a gang; while robbery with violence against persons m committed in an uninhabited place <em>or</em> in a&nbsp; gang.&nbsp; The Penal Code Spain says for both cases:&nbsp; "In an uninhabited place and in a gang."&nbsp; The generic aggravating circumstance is expressed in the same way: "To commit the&nbsp; crime at night or in an uninhabited place and in a gang," but not so the&nbsp; Philippine Code, which says: "To commit it at night or in an uninhabited place or in a gang."&nbsp; But notwithstanding that wording of the Penal Code Spain, in a judgment of November&nbsp; 6, 1880,&nbsp; the supreme court laid&nbsp; down the principle that if the acts of committing the crime by night or in an uninhabited place <em>and</em> in a&nbsp; gang&nbsp; constitute aggravating circumstance cannot be&nbsp; doubted that the three phrases&nbsp; which this&nbsp; clause&nbsp; grammatical contains refer to three different cases with the same legal force, to wit either the nighttime&nbsp; or an uninhabited place or a gang&nbsp; was selected for committing the crime.&nbsp; It is quite unreasonable that in robbery with force things it be necessary, in order to be qualified, that it be committed in uninhabited place and in a gang together, and that&nbsp; for robbery with violence&nbsp; against persons&nbsp; it be sufficient that it&nbsp; be committed in an uninhabited place or&nbsp; in&nbsp; a gang separately.</p><p>In the present case this interpretation tending to establish a precedent practically of no&nbsp; importance,&nbsp; on the&nbsp; supposition that article 509 provides that the penalty should be imposed&nbsp; in&nbsp; its maximum degree for qualified robbery, since the&nbsp; maximum degree&nbsp; (six years and one day)&nbsp; has been imposed upon the appellant Gil Revilla, although as guilty of simple robbery with three aggravating&nbsp; circumstances&nbsp; nocturnity, gang, and vagrancy.</p><p>What this court thinks improper is that he be punished, according to the opinion of the prosecution in this instance, with ten years of <em>presidio mayor</em> under No. 5 of article 503, in connection with articles 504 and 505 because&nbsp; it is evidently not a question of robbery with violence against persons to which No. 5 of article&nbsp; 503 refers.</p><p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with the costs of this&nbsp; instance against the appellant Gil&nbsp; Revilla, except the proportional part of the c corresponding to Isidoro A. Babano, according to&nbsp; the&nbsp; provision of this of September 12, 1912.</p><p><em>Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson, Moreland,</em> and <em>Trent, JJ.</em> concur.</p></div>
