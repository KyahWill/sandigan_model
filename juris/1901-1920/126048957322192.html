				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> On the night  of July  9,  1902,  while Juana Aguinaldo was going up the stairway of her house in the town of San Mateo, followed  by her husband, Guillermo  Villanueva, the latter, impelled  by the passion of jealousy, fired at his wife with a revolver which  he, in his capacity as a member of the police force, was carrying in his belt.   The shot was fired at a distance of some three yards.  The bullet struck the woman in the back and went  through her  body.   The bullet entered between the sixth and  seventh  ribs on  the right side, near  the  omoplate and the lung,  ranging upward, the point of egress being  near the nipple of the right  breast.  Notwithstanding the  seriousness of  the wound, which, according to  the physician who examined her, might well have been mortal, the judgment appealed staled that on the 7th of August the woman was still alive, and that the wound received  by her was healing.</p>
<p> These facts, fully established by the evidence, constitute the crime of  frustrated parricide, denned and punished in article  402 in connection with articles 3  and 407 of the Penal  Code.   The defendant, when aiming and discharging his revolver at his wife's back, performed all the acts which necessarily and ordinarily would produce the violent death of the  victim.   The fact that she did not die at once or a lew days after receiving  the wound was due to causes independent  of  the defendant's will.  Upon  his part he doubtless fully intended to kill the victim. He made use of a deadly weapon, and in the commission of the offense availed himself  of means which  directly  and specially tended  1o insure the  consummation of the crime without any risk to himself which might arise  from an attempt at defense on the part of his victim, who, as she looked back, attracted  by  the noise of the  weapon, received the shot in her back.</p>
<p> The  accused,  upon being arraigned on  the complaint, staled  that he hurt  done the  act charged, but  that he did not regard himself as guilty of a crime.  He stated in his defense that  the suspicion that his wife was unfaithful to him had made him jealous and that on the night in question he had  gone  1o look for her  in the house of one Captain Lucas, knowing that his wife was there at that time.  Upon his asking for his wife, Lucas's wife told him that she was not there, but a  few  moments afterwards  the defendant, lying in wait  near the house, saw her emerge from it.   The answers she  gave to  his questions and her embarrassed manner led  him  to the conclusion,  in connection  with other information in his possession concerning her conduct, that  his suspicion was not unfounded.   He then took her home, and upon arriving there saw an old woman called Pilar Pineda, the one  who had taken his wife to the house of Lucas, in the act of packing up  some clothes, which he supposed belonged to his wife.  At this, overcome  by his jealousy, he fired  at his wife with  the revolver he was carrying.</p>
<p> Until the contrary is proven the  act of wounding his wife in the back must be regarded as  voluntary, and therefore intentional, and so the accused himself testifies in his statements as a witness for the defense.  The record does not disclose that the act was committed without intent to iiarm the complainant, who still lives notwithstanding the gravity of the wound received, and her recovery,  if not lue to chance, must be attributed to the medical attention which she received  shortly after the wound.  In  other words, her recovery was due to causes  independent  of the will of the aggressor.</p>
<p> The facts  in the case fall within  the definition of the crime of frustrated  parricide,  as above stated,  owing to the relationship between the complainant and the defendant.  This circumstance and the fact  that the woman is still living and on the way to  recovery make it necessary to classify the crime, not as frustrated homicide or murder, but as frustrated parricide  inasmuch as it appears from the record to be fully proven that the defendant performed all the acts the natural tendency of which  Avas to produce the  death  of his wife. The fact that he availed himself of a deadly weapon, that he discharged it at a distance of three yards, at which range such projectiles have a great penetrating and destructive force, that he aimed the shot at the part of his victim's body  in which a  wound was most likely to deprive her of life,  and that he wounded her in  the back  without her  having received the slightest intimation of the commencement  of an aggression, are all details which demonstrate the  most complete intention to kill, and if this purpose was not  accomplished  it was due to facts completely  independent of the  will  of the accused, and wholly foreign to his criminal intent.</p>
<p> In the commission of the crime the concurrence of the mitigating circumstances No.  7 of article 9  of  the  Code must be considered, to wit, the fact that the accused acted upon the impulse of the passion of jealousy, which doubtless at the time of the commission of the  crime had deprived him of reason  and judgment.  This circumstance is offset in its favorable effect by the concurrence of the circumstance of treachery (alevosia), No. 2 of article 10 of the Code.  This circumstance in the case of a  frustrated parricide is not to be regarded as a specific qualifying circumstance,  but only as  an  ordinary  generic  circumstance, as the crime in question is undoubtedly graver than that of frustrated  murder.</p>
<p> With respect to  the adequate penalty, the court, in consideration of the circumstances of the case and of the fact that this crime was evidently due to passion, considers it proper to make use of the authority conferred  by  article 407 of the Penal Code, imposing upon the accused the penalty inferior by one degree to that of cadcna temporal, to wit, that of <em>presidio mayor </em> in its medium degree.<br>
  <br>
We  are therefore of the opinion that the judgment  appealed should  be reversed, and  the defendant, Ouillermo Yillanueva, condemned to the penalty of eight years and one day of <em>presidio mayor</em>, with the accessories of absolute temporary disqualification and subjection to the vigilance of the  authorities for a term equal to that of the principal penalty, to run from the expiration of the principal penalty, to the payment to the complainant, Juana Aguinaldo, of an indemnification  of 600 Mexican pesos, without subsidiary imprisonment  in case of insolvency (as provided by  art. 51  of  the  Code),  and to pay the costs of both instances.  So ordered.</p>
<p> <em>Cooper, Willard,</em> and <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p> <em>Arellano, C. J.,</em> and  <em>Mapa, J.,</em> dissent.</p>
