				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Late at night on  the 4th  of May, 1906, Maria Amparo, a  married woman, whose husband was absent at the time, being asleep  in company with  her mother-in-law, Maria Manalo,  in  her own house, situated in tlie barrio of Tibag, municipality of Calapan, Island of Mindoro, was suddenly awakened by feeling that an individual had stretched  himself over her; she then  cried out for the mother-in-law, saying that there was somebody  in the house,  and at the same time caught her assailant by the hair, and after having managed in some way to raise herself up, the assailant made efforts to throw her down, but owing to her cries and the noise of the struggle, the mother-in-law awoke,  and, striking  a match, at  once recognized the accused as the man  who was  trying to outrage Maria Amparo.   The mother-in-law caught him by the coat  in order to separate him from the assaulted person; he then went toward the door of the  house dragging along Maria Manalo, whom he pushed  and  threw  to   the  floor;  the   latter, however, managed to get up and going downstairs pursued the accused, though  she  failed to  overtake  him.   She at once reported the affair to the lieutenant  of the barrio,  who called at the house of the offended parties and found  that the accused had left his hat on the mat (petate)  on which the rape was attempted; said hat was  offered as evidence at the trial in the court of the justice of the peace.</p>
<p>A complaint was filed by  the provincial fiscal on the 12th  of  September, 1906, and  proceedings  having been instituted by reason  thereof, the judge, in  view of the result, sentenced Eligio Cruz Garcia to the penalty of six months and one day of <em>prision correccional</em>, and to pay the costs; from said decision counsel for the accused  appealed.</p>
<p>The facts stated and proven in this cause constitute the crime of attempted rape, defined and  punished  under article 438 in connection with article 3, paragraph 3,  and article 66 of the Penal  Code, inasmuch  as  the accused, without being in any  way connected with Maria Amparo, a married  woman, entered her house  at a late hour of night at a time when her husband was absent, and forcibly tried to outrage her while asleep, against her will,  using violence on her person;  and notwithstanding the resistance made by the woman and in spite of her  cries to her mother-in-law, who was asleep at a short distance from her in the same house, refused to abandon his criminal  purpose.  It is an unquestionable fact that the  accused was  stretched over the offended woman and that when the latter managed to raise herself, the accused endeavored  to throw her down, and that from the beginning when she woke up she noticed that her skirt had been raised to the knee; it can not be denied that  the accused had begun  the commission of his criminal intent to forcibly outrage the offended party,  and if he did not perform  all of the acts necessary to consummate the crime it wras owing to the stubborn resistance offered by the  woman and to assistance rendered by her mother-in-law, Maria Manalo.</p>
<p>The accused pleaded not guilty,  but  notwithstanding his denial and allegations and the evidence offered by the defense, the case furnishes full and complete proof of his guilt as the convicted principal  in the  crime  herein.</p>
<p>The statements of the offended woman, Maria Amparo, and of. her mother-in-law, Maria Manalo,  who was an eyewitness of the affair, both women having thoroughly recognized the accused by the light of a match  struck by the last-named woman when  she awoke,  besides the fact that Eligio Cruz Garcia was  previously  known to them as a resident of the place, are confirmed by the next-door neighbor, Mariano Madrigal, who, upon  being  awakened by the cries coming from the house of the offended party, opened his window and looked out and shortly thereafter saw the accused, whom  he then recognized, going out, running  without his hat and  pursued  for some distance by Maria Manalo.</p>
<p>It further appears in  the case, according to the testimony of Maria Manalo,  that the father of the accused, Leonardo Cruz Garcia, approached her, asking her pardon for what had taken place and offering to pay for all damages caused, and that the  accused, according to the testimony of the offended woman, as stated in page 97 of the record, in the presence of  the provincial fiscal and of the copyist, Juan  Gozar, asked her to pardon him for the offense he had committed; such pardon asked by him is a further proof  of his  guilt  The  court ordered this  statement read  into the record in spite of the opposition and exception of the counsel for the  accused.</p>
<p>The evidence adduced by the defense could in no manner counteract  the satisfactory result of that offered by the prosecution because  notwithstanding the  alibi attempted by the accused, the fact that both he and his father did not recognize the hat left behind when running  away on the night in  question, and the affirmation of two individuals, Pedro Mercado and Martin Membrot,who it is said were on duty patrolling the town on that night, to the effect that they questioned the women as to who was the  man that committed  the act,  and that their  reply was that they failed to recognize him; his culpability appears to have been well established inasmuch as said abili can not destroy the testimony of the offended woman  and her mother-in-law, corroborated  by Mariano  Madrigal, who also saw the accused leaving the house in question, running without a hat because he had left it behind in the house; the hat was immediately offered as evidence in the  court of the justice of the peace when information of the fact was filed, and in the light of what is affirmed by the offended parties it is not possible to admit the statements of the two policemen, and Avith more reason if what was declared by Eliseo Paras, that the two  said individuals, Mercado  and Meinbrot, were not detailed to do duty on the night in question, is taken into account.</p>
<p>In the commission of the crime the aggravating circumstance of the attempted rape having been performed at a late hour and  in the darkness of night must be considered, and also that the house of the offended woman was entered in order to carry it out; which effects are compensated by the special circumstance established as a mitigating one by article 11; therefore, the penalty of <em>prision correccional</em> should be imposed in its medium degree.</p>
<p>By virtue of the foregoing considerations,  it  is  our opinion that the judgment  appealed from should be affirmed, provided,  however, that the  accused  shall  be  sentenced to the penalty of three years of <em>prision correccional</em>, to suffer the accessory penalties of article 61, and to pay the costs of both instances.   So ordered.</p>
<em>Arellano, G.  J., Mapa, Johnson, Willard,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>

<em>DISSENTING</em></div>
<p><strong>CARSON, J.:</strong></p>
<p>After careful examination of the testimony of record, I think that  there is reasonable doubt as  to the identity of the accused with the person who entered the  house of the complaining witness at the time when the alleged attempt to commit  rape is said to have  taken  place;  and I am convinced  that, whoever  that  person was,  such  person did not in fact  make the attempt as  alleged.</p>
<p>The identification of the accused as the person who was in the house on the night in question rests:</p>
<p>First, on the testimony of the complaining witness and her mother-in-law, who  alleged that they recognized  him by the light of a match;</p>
<p>Second, on the testimony of a neighbor, Mariano Madrigal, who states that he recognized the accused by the light of the moon as the person who ran away from the house of the complaining witness just after the alleged attempt was committed;</p>
<p>Third, on the fact that a hat,  alleged to be the hat of the accused, was found on the floor  of the house of the complaining witness'after the occurrence.</p>
<p>Two witnesses, who appeared to be the only wholly disinterested witnesses who testified in the case, swore that on the  night  in question they were  acting  as police or watchmen; that, attracted by the noise, they went to the house of the complaining witness immediately after the alleged attempt; and that the complaining witness and her mother-in-law told them that they did not recognize the man who had been  in the house and could not say who he was. The testimony of  the  neighbor, Mariano Madrigal, that he recognized the accused by the light of the moon as he ran away  from the house, is put in doubt by an examination of the calendar, which shows that at  the hour of the night when  it is alleged the attempt was committed the moon, still in its first quarter, must  have been so low in the heavens as to render it highly improbable that it would furnish sufficient light to enable this witness to identify the person he claims to  have seen running away  from the house. There is not one scintilla of evidence of record that the hat which was found on the floor of the house after the occurrence was the  hat of  the  accused,  but  there are positive and uncontradicted declarations of the father and brother of the accused to the  fact  that the hat was not his property and that he had never worn it.</p>
<p>Thus it appears  that the positive evidence of the prosecution identifying  the  accused as the person who was in the house when  the alleged attempt was committed  rests on an unsatisfactory and most untrustworthy foundation; on the other hand, the defense established an alibi, which the prosecution wholly failed to break down on cross-examination.  It is true that the proof of this alibi rests on the testimony of the relations and friends of the accused, but, as a rule, the only witnesses who can be relied upon to testify as  to one's whereabouts at an  hour when  people usually are at home and in bed are one's relations and friends Avho live in the .same dwelling house; and no evidence was introduced by the prosecution to contradict or to cast doubt upon the^statements of the witnesses for the defense.</p>
<p>But, even if the evidence identifying  the accused as the person who entered the house were sufficient, there would still be a  grave  doubt  as to his guilt  of the crime with which he is charged.  I do not question the fact that some unknown man was in the house on the night in question, but that this person was there with the attempt to commit rape and did in fact attempt to commit rape is not established beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>In the light of all the circumstances attendant upon the presence of the unknown man in the house of the complaining witness, I am disposed to think  that there are grounds for suspecting that such person entered the house  with the consent and connivance of the complaining witness;  that when her mother-in-law was awakened, the unknown was compelled  to take to  flight; that the complaining witness thereupon  charged him with an attempted rape  in order to clear herself of the charge of having invited him to her arms; and  that later,  when the disturbance created  by the incident had created a scandal, and suspicion was rightly or wrongly turned upon the accused, the complaining witness either could not, would not, or dared not retract the false charge of attempted rape, the first lie begetting the others necessary for its support.  If this hypothesis, which is inconsistent with the guilt of the accused, is not proven, beyond a  reasonable  doubt, to  be  inconsistent with the facts, as proven, the accused should  be acquitted.</p>
<p>On the  testimony of the  complaining witness  herself, she first knew  of the presence of the accused when she found herself in his embrace.   The house was but  a small, one-room shack, and it does not appear how he could have forced his entrance without awakening either of the women who were  sleeping there.   She further states that she struggled for some little time with the accused in  an effort to get up,  but was forced  back upon the floor; that these movements did not awaken  her mother-in-law, who was lying by her side; but that,  when she again struggled to get up, her mother-in-law was awakened and struck a match, whereupon the accused immediately fled from the house, pursued by the mother-in-law.  It is strange indeed that her first cries when  she found herself attacked in the dead of the night by an unknown man did not immediately awaken the sleeper who  was lying at her side, and I am strongly disposed to believe that  such would have been the case if she  had not been  expecting him  just  where she found  him.</p>
<p>I do not believe that any person who knew the house and the people living there, as did the accused,  could hope to force his way into the house, and violate one of the inmates against her will and without her consent, without awakening the inmate  sleeping in the  same room and without awakening the neighbors  living in nipa shacks a few yards away.   It is almost incredible that anyone (but a desperate criminal, intent on accomplishing his purpose, if need be, under  threats of bodily  injury,  or with violence against all  who might interfere)  would attempt to commit  rape under such circumstances.</p>
<p>It appears that the accused is  little more than a schoolboy ; that the person who entered the house did not utter a threat; that he used no force  or violence which should intimidate either of the women; that he was not armed, or at least that he did not have any weapon in his hand or exposed to view; and that, immediately when the second woman in the house was  awakened, he  took to flight.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances,  I  can not believe that we are justified in declaring, beyond a reasonable doubt,  that his  object or expectation in entering was  to violate the complaining witness against her  will and without her consent;  Whether the true  fact be, as I believe, that he entered the house with the  consent and by the invitation of the complaining witness, or whether he entered without her knowledge in the hope that afterwards he could induce her to consent to his advances, a conviction lor  the crime of attempted rape can not be sustained unless  the court is satisfied, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the accused was the person who enteied the house, and that it was his intention to force the complaining witness to accede to his wishes by the use  of force or  violence or by threats and intimidation.  I do not  think that the evidence of record sustains such a finding.<br>
