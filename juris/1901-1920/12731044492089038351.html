				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This case has been here transmitted for review of a judgment of the Court of 
First Instance of the Province of Lanao, convicting the accused of the crime of 
robbery with homicide, committed upon the person of Charles H. Mills, and 
sentencing him to death.
<p>The evidence establishes beyond doubt that sometime previous to September 14, 
1915,—probably a day or two before this date—a party of about eight armed Moros 
had gone to a certain place near a lafce in the Province of Lanao in order to 
procure subsistence by begging or stealing. The defendants Alabot, Kao, and 
Makarimpong, and the witnesses for the prosecution, Kalaku and Kuruao, were 
members of the party, but the organizer and apparent chief of it was one named 
Rumaub. When they had obtained a certain amount of palay they proceeded to 
return. On their way home they passed the house of the Sultan Sarip, which 
Rumaub, Alabot and Uru, another member of the party, entered. Upon leaving this 
house they continued their way until they reached a cotta, where Rumaub told 
them to rest.</p>
<p>Early in the morning of the next day, September 14,1915, while the party was 
still lying in wait in the cotta, a shot was fired by Rumaub at an American 
passing in the roadway a few meters away. This shot created confusion among some 
members of the party. The witnesses Kalaku and Kuruao ran away. While they were 
thus running Rumaub cried to them asking why they ran instead of shooting; and 
either because of this cry or out of natural curiosity, they looked back and saw 
that Alabot was slashing the American with his cris. The defendant Alabot upon 
hearing the shot did not run away but instead jumped and ran to the place where 
he was later seen slashing the American.</p>
<p>Sometime afterwards Rumaub and Alabot and the other members of the party 
caught up with Kalalu and Kuruao, and they all proceeded to the house of Adam, 
the father of the latter two. At Adam's house Rumaub and Alabot each related the 
part he had taken in the killing of the American. Alabot told Adam that he had 
slashed the American who had been shot by Rumaub and had taken from the former 
his revolver and money. At this time Alabot was in possession of these things; 
but they were taken from him by Rumaub who gave the revolver to Adam, as dowry 
for his daughter, and divided the money among the members of the party.</p>
<p>On or about the same day that the events narrated above took place the dead 
body of an American by the name of Charles H. Mills was brought to the hospital 
at Dansalan and was there examined by Dr. E. W. Ames, the provincial health 
officer, assisted by the witness Nicasio Torres. The body exhibited two bullet 
wounds in the abdomen, being the places of entrance and exit of the bullet, a 
wound on the neck which almost severed the head from the body, and other wounds 
in various parts of the body, caused by blows inflicted with a cutting 
instrument.</p>
<p>Upon this state of the facts the first and most important question that 
naturally suggests itself is, whether the American shot by Rumaub and cut by 
Alabot was the deceased Charles H. Mills; and counsel for the defendant insists 
that the proof fails to show that the American attacked by the party* of Moros 
was Charles H. Mills. In this connection it may be noted that the deceased 
Charles H. Mills had two wounds caused by a bullet shot which passed clear 
through his abdomen; the American killed by Rumaub and Alabot had first been 
shot by the former. Charles H. Mills had several wounds inflicted with a cutting 
instrument; the American killed by Rumaub and Alabot was slashed by the latter 
with his <em>cris</em>. Charles H. Mills died on or about September 14, 1915; 
the killing of the American by Rumaub and Alabot also took place on or about 
that date.</p>
<p>No question appears to have been made at the trial in the court below as to 
the identity of the person slain; and counsel for the defendant as well as 
counsel for the prosecution there assumed, in questioning the witnesses, that 
the person slain by the party, of which the accused was a member, was none other 
than Charles H. Mills. In view of all the circumstances, we have no doubt 
whatever on this point.</p>
<p>The next contention of counsel for Alabot which we consider is that it is not 
shown that the trial court had jurisdiction over the case, in that it does not 
appear that the barrio of Tuluan where the killing occurred was in the province 
of Lanao. In the present case the information charged that the crime was 
committed in or near the barrio of Tuluan, Province of Lanao. It was proven at 
the trial that the crime was in fact committed in said barrio but nobody 
testified directly that this barria is in the province of Lanao. However, a 
leading question which presupposes that said barrio is in the province of Lanao 
was asked without objection on the part of the defense, which is: "Sabe Usted si 
se ha matado a algiin americano en el sitio de <em>Tuluan</em> de la provincia 
de Lanao? The answer was: "Si señor, yo se; Rumaub fue el que le mato."</p>
<p>This is sufficient in our opinion to show that the barrio of Tuluan where the 
crime was proven to have been committed is in the province of Lanao. 
Furthermore, under section 275 of the Code of Civil Procedure courts have the 
power to take judicial notice of the fact that a certain municipality or barrio 
is within its jurisdiction. (Marzon <em>vs</em>. Udtujan, 20 Phil. Rep., 232. 
<em>See also</em> U. S. <em>vs</em>. Chua Mo, 23 Phil. Rep., 233; U. S. 
<em>vs</em>. Lim Soon, 34 Phil. Rep., 668.)</p>
<p>Another contention of the defense is that the court below erred in dismissing 
the separate cases against Adam, Kalaku, and Kuruao so that they might testify 
for the prosecution and against Alabot in this case. The record does not 
affirmatively show that the three mentioned were charged with the same offense 
as Alabot. Supposing that such was the case and admitting, without deciding that 
Act No. 2709 is applicable where the several accused are prosecuted separately 
upon different informations, it is evident that any error that the court may 
have made in discharging the three to be used as witnesses in this case did not 
affect the competency of their testimony. (U. S. <em>vs</em>. Abanzado, 37 PhiU 
Rep., 658.)</p>
<p>The defendant's last contention is that he was tried upon a complaint upon 
which he was never arraigned and to which he never pleaded. On this point the 
record shows that on October 20, 1916, he was charged in the justice of the 
peace court of Dansalan in the Province of Lanao with the crime of brigandage. 
Upon this charge he was arraigned, pleaded not guilty, and waived his right to a 
preliminary investigation. The case was transmitted to the Court of First 
Instance, where on March 13, 1917, a criminal prosecution was instituted against 
him charging him with a crime denominated as "robbery with homicide," but which 
more properly was brigandage as described in the body of the information. On 
March 14, 1917, an amended information was filed in which he was charged with 
the complex crime of robbery with homicide. As presented, this amended 
information was defective in that it did not charge that the criminal act was 
committed with intent to gain ("con animo de lucro"). On March 15, 1917, the 
accused was arraigned upon the latter information and put in a plea of not 
guilty.</p>
<p>Upon these facts we are of the opinion, that, both informations having been 
filed prior to the day of the arraignment and plea, the filing of the second 
information, charging the offense of robbery with homicide, had the effect of 
withdrawing tYie original which charged brigandage. It will therefore be 
presumed in the absence of proof to the contrary that the second was the 
information upon which the defendant was arraigned and to which he pleaded.</p>
<p>As already stated, the second information was defective in failing to charge 
that the robbery was committed with intent to gain (con animo de lucro); and it 
appears that after the defendant had pleaded and the first witness for the 
prosecution had been called to the stand, the attorney for the defendant moved 
that the case be dismissed on the ground that the information was for this 
reason insufficient. Thereupon the trial judge remarked that he would permit the 
prosecuting attorney to amend by inserting the words "con animo de lucro," which 
was accordingly done. To this action exception was taken by counsel for the 
defense.</p>
<p>In order to determine whether the action of the trial court in permitting 
this amendment of the information constitutes reversible error, we shall first 
consider whether the accused could have been convicted of the crime of robbery 
with homicide upon the infbrmation as it stood prior to the insertion therein of 
the additional words "con animo de lucro." Intent to gain is undoubtedly an 
essential element in the crime of robbery, and this is obvious from the very 
terms of the definition contained in article 502 of the Penal Code. It will be 
observed, however, that this factor relates to the internal mental purpose of 
the actor, and it is not an external circumstance by which one act of robbery 
can be identified and distinguished from another. The intent is generally 
discovered by inference from the external circumstances connected with the 
commission of the offense; and in case of robbery these circumstances usually 
reveal with infallible certainty the existence of such intent.</p>
<p>It is declared in subsection 3 of section 6 of General Orders No. 58, that 
the acts or omission complained of as constituting the crime or public offense 
should be stated in ordinary and concise language, without repetition, not 
necessarily in the words of the statute, but in such form as to enable a person 
of common understanding to know what is intended and the court to pronounce 
judgment according to right.</p>
<p>This provision has been repeatedly applied by this court, and it has been 
held in numerous cases that it is not necessary for the complaint or information 
to follow the exact language of the statute. It is enough if it sufficiently 
describes the crime defined by law. (U. S. vs. Go Changco, 23 Phil. Rep., 641; 
U. S. <em>vs</em>. Gatmaitan, 4 Phil. Rep., 265; U. S. <em>vs</em>. Grant and 
Kennedy, 18 Phil. Rep., 122; U. S. <em>vs</em>. Vecina, 4 Phil. Rep., 529; U. S. 
<em>vs</em>. Sarabia, 4 Phil. Rep., 566.) Evidently the important end to be 
accomplished is to describe the act with sufficient certainty that the accused 
may be apprised of the nature of the charge against him. In section 7 of General 
Orders No. 58, it is declared that "when an offense shall have been described 
with sufficient certainty to identify the act, an erroneous allegation as to the 
person injured shall be deemed immaterial." Also in section 8 of General Orders 
No. 58, where a form suitable for a complaint is given, it is indicated that the 
things to be set forth are the acts or omissions charged as an offense; and 
there is no indication that, where the external acts are described with 
certainty, the complaint or information will be insufficient for failure to 
state the intent with which those acts were done. The obvious conclusion is that 
the principal purpose of an information is accomplished when the act which is 
the subject of the prosecution is fully identified.</p>
<p>In the United States <em>vs</em>. San Pedro (4 Phil. Rep., 405) it was held 
that where all the other facts constituting the crime of robbery have been 
established, judgment of conviction will not be reversed on appeal on the ground 
that the information failed specifically to allege that the crime was committed 
<em>con animo de lucro</em>, or that the property taken was not the property of 
the accused, it appearing that it was taken with force and violence from the 
possession of the complaining witness. In the opinion in this case, it was 
said:</p>
<p>"The information in this case alleges that the accused, with force and 
violence, took a pistol from the possession of the complaining witness. Unless 
the contrary appears, the <em>animo de lucro</em> is presumed, where all the 
other facts which would constitute the crime of robbery have been established, 
and it is also presumed 'that things which a person possesses are owned by him, 
unless the contrary appears.'"</p>
<p>In support of this proposition reference was made to a decision of the 
supreme court of Spain wherein the following language was used:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p>
<p>"While it is true that the intent of gain constitutes one of the essential 
and characteristic elements of the crime of robbery and that of theft, it is no 
less true that the possession of things belonging to another against the will of 
the owner, whether force or violence be used, implies, as a general rule, said 
intent of gain, as being the natural and proper motive for the perpetration of 
the act. For this reason, it is necessary to overcome in each case the force of 
this legal presumption, when it is alleged, with facts showing that there was no 
such intent."</p>
<p>In the case now before us the information, as amended, is in the following 
words:</p>
<p>"The undersigned, acting as fiscal for the Province of Lanao, accuses Alabut 
(<em>a</em>) Paguinaguina, a Moro, of the crime of robbery with homicide 
committed as follows:</p>
<p>"That, on or about the 14th day of September, 1915, in or near the barrio of 
Tuluan, in the Province of Lanao, Department of Mindanao and Sulu, the said 
accused Alabut (<em>a</em>) Paguinaguina, forming a band with Moros Adam, 
Rumaub, Uru, Kalapi, Kalaku, Kuruao, Kao, and Makarimpong, willfully, 
unlawfully, and criminally, did, treacherously, with evident premeditation, in 
an uninhabited place, in a band, and armed with guns and <em>krises</em>, 
obtain, by means of violence and (with intent of gain), a revolver with its 
munitions, a watch worth P3, and P36 in cash belonging to one Charles H. Mills 
whom the said band killed by shooting, and on whom several wounds were inflicted 
with his <em>kris</em> by the accused Alabot with a view to securing for himself 
the articles aforementioned, * * *."</p>
<p>We are of the opinion that, following the decision in United States 
<em>vs</em>. San Pedro (<em>supra</em>), this information charges every 
ingredient of the offense of robbery which is essential to be stated, even 
without reference to the words "y con animo de lucro." From the language used 
only one reasonable inference with regard to the intention entertained by the 
accused can in our opinion be drawn, which is, that the robbery was committed 
with intent to gain. The information clearly shows that the articles were seized 
unlawfully, by violence and against the will of the owner, and this implies that 
they were taken with the purpose of gain. Especially instructive in this 
connection are the closing words of the complaint "con el fin de apoderarse de 
los efectos mencionados." The act of appropriating the personal effects of the 
person who is the victim of an assault lil$e that described in this complaint 
necessarily involves the idea that the act was done with intent to deprive the 
true owner of his property, to the consequent gain of the other party.</p>
<p>If the accused could have been convicted of robbery upon the information as 
it stood prior to the amendment in question, it is evident that he was not 
prejudiced by the addition of the words imputing to him an intent to gain; and 
the fact that the amendment was permitted can not constitute reversible error. 
We also observe, in passing, that the case is not changed by the circumstance 
that the attorney for the accused objected to the amendment at the time it was 
made. In our view the inserted words merely expressed with greater fullness and 
clearness an idea readily deducible from the other language used in the 
information and they really added nothing to its legal effect. The addition of 
words of this character to an information or complaint is not a substantial 
amendment, such as might prejudice the accused. It must rather be considered a 
nonprejudicial and formal amendment admissible, in the discretion of the trial 
court, at any time during the trial. (Sec. 9, Gen. Orders No. 58.)</p>
<p>We acquiesce in the conclusion reached by the Attorney-General in the brief 
filed by him for the Government in this case, to the effect that the accused is 
not clearly shown to have attacked the deceased treacherously; but the 
aggravating circumstance of the commission of the offense in an uninhabited 
place was present, since the crime occurred in a place remote from human 
habitation.</p>
<p>The offense committed was robbery with homicide, punishable under subsection 
1 of article 503 of the Penal Code, in the commission of which is to be 
appreciate4 the aggravating circumstance above mentioned. The trial court did 
not consider lack of instruction and education of the accused as a mitigating 
circumstance, and we see no reason why the action of the court in this respect 
should be revised, it not being customary in this court to recognize lack of 
instruction and education as an attenuating circumstance in offenses against 
property.</p>
<p>It results that the sentence of the lower court condemning the accused to 
death was not erroneous; and said judgment is affirmed, with costs of this 
instance against the accused. The penalty of death will be executed at a time to 
be fixed by the lower court in accordance with law; and if the death penalty 
should not be executed by reason of the extension of executive clemency to the 
condemned person, he shall, during life, be subject to the accessory penalties 
prescribed in article 53 of the Penal Code, if not specially remitted in the 
pardon. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Johnson, Malcolm, Avanceña</em>, and <em>Fisher, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p>
