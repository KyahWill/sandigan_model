				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>While a religious procession was passing through  the streets of Maasin,  in the Province of  Leyte, and  several persons  were walking immediately behind the band of music which was a part of the procession, the complainant, Padre Andres Avila, who was the parish priest and  who was in charge of the procession, directed these persons to leave  that place and to join in  the  procession itself.  All of them except one left the place.  Thereupon the  defendant said to a bystander, "We will see if I will be ordered to leave there," and he went to the place where the former group had been  disbanded.  Thereupon the complainant went to him and told him that "that was a reserved place in the procession and that if he desired to join in the procession he could  go before or in the middle of the procession, and that for him to remain where he  was would be a disturbance  of the order of the procession."  The defendant  refused to leave the place and  thereupon the complainant laid hands upon him.   The defendant pushed the complainant away and the complainant struck the defendant  with  a candle.  The defendant thereupon struck the complainant with his fists, causing slight injuries.</p>
<p>The defendant was prosecuted for the crime of <em>injurias graves</em>, as defined in articles 456 and 457 of the  Penal Code.   He was convicted and sentenced to one year eight months and twenty days of banishment and prohibited from coming within 50 kilometers of the pueblo of Maasin during that time.  He was also sentenced  to pay  a fine of 650 pesetas.</p>
<p>There was  considerable testimony  in the  case  as to whether the place in the rear of the,band. was or was not a part of the procession, it being claimed by  the defendant that the procession terminated with the band  and that it was  the custom  of the people to follow the band without joining the files in front of the band of which the procession was  made up.   We do not find it necessary  to decide this question, because we do not think under any circumstances the defendant can be convicted of the crime  of <em>injurias graves</em>.  We have had occasion recently to discuss that offense and in  the case of Padre Simeon OÃ±ate <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Engracio Beltran,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> No. 2182, we said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"El enjuiciado pudo haber buscado al querellante en otro sitio que no fuera via publica a pedir las explicaciones que deseaba, pero  prefirio hacerlo en publico en la calle y a la vista del vecindario con indudable y maliciosa intencion de afrentar, envilecer y menospreciar al sacerdote Onate como ministro del culto de la mayoria de los vecinos de Nabua."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the present case, while it appears that the defendant went where he did for the purpose of seeing what the priest would do, we do not think that it appears that he had any intention of committing a physical assault upon the complainant.  If he had no  such  intention, then the offense of <em>injurias graves </em>was not committed.  Every street fight in which two persons engage can not constitute that offense. There must be  evidence that the defendant  intended to engage in the fight for the purpose of insulting and bringing his opponent into contempt in the eyes of the public. (Judgments of the supreme court of Spain of the 12th of July, 1878, and the 31st of May, 1892.)</p>
<p>The judgment of the  court below is  reversed  and the defendant  is acquitted,  with the  costs of both instances <em>de oficio</em>.  After the expiration of ten days from the date of final judgment let the cause be remanded to the Court of First Instance for proper procedure.  So ordered.</p>
<em>Arellano,  C. J., Torres, Mapa, Johnson,  Carson,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
