That the defendants be granted any other relief that may be just and equitable."<br></blockquote>On the 6th day of January, 1906, an answer was filed in said cause alleged to be by the defendant, without indicating whether said answer was for all of the defendants or for one or for more of them.&nbsp; This answer, however, contained a general and special denial.&nbsp; Under the general denial all of the facts contained in the complaint were denied.&nbsp; Under the special denial several defenses were interposed:&nbsp; First, that the properties designated in the complaint were a part of the public domain and belonged to the State (<i>Gobierno Insular</i>); second, that the <i>Iglesia Filipino, Independiente</i> took possession of the said property by virtue of a circular of the Insular Government of the 10th of January, 1903, for the purpose of administering it for the benefit of the inhabitants of said municipalities; and third, that the <i>Iglesia Catolica Aposiolica Romona</i> did not have civil personality to possess and acquire the ownership of <i>bienes parroquiales</i> constructed during the time of the Spanish Government; that the priests of said church, during the existence of the sovereignty of Spain in the Philippine Islands were paid by the Government, and therefore the ownership of the property was in the Spanish Government.<br><br>On the 19th day of January, 1906, the said defendant Lazaro Baens appeared and answered said complaint, denying the right of <i>La Iglesia Catolica Apostolica Romana</i>, as well as the right of <i>La Iglesia Filipina Independiente</i>, and as well as the right of Gregorio Aglipay to occupy or administer the <i>visita de</i> Julong-Dujat<br><br>On the 2d day of January, 1906, the defendant Canuto Ureta answered the complaint stating that he had no interest whatever in the <i>visita de</i> Tinajeros.<br><br>On the 14th day of January, 1906, Potenciano Garcia filed an answer denying that the plaintiff had any right or interest whatever in the <i>visita de</i> Dampalit.&nbsp; Some of the other defendants appeared and answered, renouncing any right whatever in the properties in question.&nbsp; Finally, commencing with 'the 15th of May, 1907, testimony was presented by the plaintiff and some of the defendants, with reference to some of the properties mentioned in said complaint. With reference to the following <i>visitas de Ningan</i>, Catmon, Tinajeros, Maysilo, Matahong, and Muson, and the cemeteries of Morong and Cardona, none of the defendants appeared nor presented any proof whatever.<br><br>With reference to each of the above-named <i>visitas</i> and the said cemeteries, the plaintiff presented three or more witnesses, each of which testified that <i>La Iglesia Catolica Apostolica Romana</i> had been in the quiet and peaceable enjoyment of said properties, and that they had been used by it for a time immemorial, for the purposes of said church, until said church had been molested in its quiet possession of the same by some of the defendants.<br><br>With reference to the <i>visitas</i> of Dampalit and Julong-Dujat, the defendants Potenciano Garcia and Lazaro Baens appeared and attempted to show that they were each entitled to the possession of the sitios of Dampalit and Julong-Dujat, respectively.&nbsp; As against the proof of these defendants, the plaintiff showed by a number of witnesses that said <i>visitas</i> had been dedicated by <i>La Iglesia Catolica Apostolica Romana</i> for the purposes of said church and that said church had been in the quiet and peaceable enjoyment of said <i>visitas</i> for a time immemorial, using the same for the exclusive purposes of said church.<br><br>With reference to the properties mentioned in said complaint situated in the pueblo of Caloocan, no proof whatever was offered by the plaintiff nor by any of the defendants.&nbsp; There being no proof therefore in the record, relating to the right of the possession, of these properties situated in the said pueblo of Caloocan, we make no finding as to the right of possession of the parties in this action.<br><br>No proof whatever was offered by any of the parties with reference to the church and cemetery situated in the barrio of Novaliches in the pueblo of Malabon.&nbsp; We, therefore, make no finding with reference to the right of the parties to this action to these properties.<br><br>The question presented by the pleadings and the proof is whether or not the prayer of the petition should be granted.<br><br>The evidence discloses, beyond peradventure of doubt, that the plaintiff had been in the quiet and peaceable possession of the different parcels of property, with reference to which evidence was presented, for a period immemorial, until some time between the years 1896-1899, when they were molested in their possession and deprived of the same by some of the defendants.&nbsp; This court has repeatedly decided that where a person has been in the long possession of real property and has been deprived of the possession thereof, he may recover it as against one in possession, unless the latter can show a better right thereto.&nbsp; (Bishop of Cebu <i>vs</i>.

Rep., 691.)<br><br>Since the decisions of this court in the foregoing cases, the Supreme Court of the United States, in an appeal from a decision of the supreme court of Porto Rico, in the case of The Municipality of Ponce <i>vs</i>. The Roman Catholic Apostolic Church in Porto Rico<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [1]<sub></sub> </sup>(October term, 1907), (6 Off. Gaz., 1213) held, in a case in which the facts were very similar to the facts in the various abovecited cases, under laws analogous to the laws in force in the Philippine Islands, relating to the property of the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church, that said church <i>had not only a right to the possession of its church edifices, but was the lawful owner of the same.</i><br><br>In the case of The Roman Catholic Apostolic Church et al. <i>vs</i>. The Municipality of Placer (11 Phil. Rep., 315) the facts therein being very analogous to the facts in the present case, this court followed the said decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, holding that, under the Spanish law heretofore existing in these Islands, and the provisions of the treaty of Paris, the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church is the owner of the church buildings, convents, and cemeteries and the municipalities wherein the same are situated have no right of ownership therein by reason of funds or lands contributed for the foundation or erection thereof.<br><br>Our attention has not been called to any express grant or grants of land by the Crown of Spain for the purposes of the church upon which particular churches were erected, and it is believed that, during the early history of the sovereignty of Spain in the Indies, no such grants can be found, but no fact is better established in both secular and ecclesiastical history than the fact that the Crown of Spain and the Pope always cooperated from the very earliest history of the possession of the Indies in the extension of the great benefits offered by the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church to the <i>Indio</i>, as well as to the peoples of Europe.&nbsp; If any difference whatever existed in the efforts thus made in the great interest which the church took in the different peoples, it was in favor of the <i>Indio</i>.&nbsp; Scarcely had the Indies been discovered until the Pope and the Crown of Spain began to manifest a deep interest in the religious and educational welfare of the people of the Indies.&nbsp; (<i>Bula de</i> Alejandro VI of the 4th of May, 1493:&nbsp; also the <i>Bula</i> of the Kith of December, 1501; Ordenanza 5 (<i>a</i>) <i>por el Consejo de Las Indias</i>, 1575; law 10, title 1, book 1 of the Laws of the <i>Indias</i>, of the 1st of June, 1574; law 14, title 2, book 1 of the Laws of the <i>Indias</i>, and many others, the collection of which may be found in vol. 7 of <i>Legislacion Ultramarina</i>, p. 476.)<br><br>From the reading of these various <i>Bulas</i> and royal decrees and <i>ordenanzas</i>, it will be seen that the Government and the church were constantly working together for the advancement of the religious and educational welfare of the <i>Indios</i>.&nbsp; The Government lent its most enthusiastic support to the efforts that were made by the church in this regard, even to the extent of paying out of the public exchequer, funds, together with funds contributed by the <i>encomenderos</i> and the people of the pueblos, for the purpose of erecting the magnificent Catholic churches existing everywhere throughout the Spanish island possessions.&nbsp; While the Crown of Spain always reserved a certain control over the operations of the Catholic Church, yet no one can doubt that, when these <i>lands</i> were donated or designated and the church edifices were erected thereon, it was the intention of the Crown that such lands and such edifices should be devoted absolutely to the use of the church.&nbsp; It is a well-known fact that, when a church edifice of the Roman Catholic Church was once accepted and dedicated for religious purposes, it thereafter could never be used for any other purpose.&nbsp; The Catholic Church certainly had a right to believe at least that, during the three hundred years or more that it occupied its churches in the Philippine Islands, without protest or objection on the part of the Crown of Spain, the Crown had intended at least that they should become the absolute owners of such properties.&nbsp; And no protest has been called to our attention during a time immemorial and no protest or objection by the different pueblos to the right of ownership which the church has exercised for from two to three hundred years over the properties upon which the edifices of the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church were erected.&nbsp; Not only is it believed that the Crown of Spain intended that the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church should exercise absolute dominion over such properties, but under the treaty of Paris the Government of the United States obligated itself to protect all such interests.&nbsp; The Roman Catholic Apostolic Church occupied the different properties in question in this case for a time so long that no one in the pueblos could remember when such properties were not occupied and used for the benefit of said church, until about the years 1896-1899. The occupancy of property for from two to three hundred years without protest of any kind whatever from the donors would seem at least to be sufficient time, in the absence of positive proof to the contrary, that such donation was made for the purpose of transferring to the donee all rights and interests in such property.<br><br>Therefore, adhering to and following the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of The Municipality of Ponce <i>vs</i>. The Roman Catholic Apostolic Church in Porto Rico<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</span></sup> (6 Off.
