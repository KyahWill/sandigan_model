				G.R. No. 12696, November 19, 1917</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. PETRA TOLOSA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.

				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">An all too frequent occurrence in the Philippines, in which a certain class 
of ignorant people seem to take a delight, is for two or more individuals to 
express loudly and in unabridged and forceful words, their frank opinion of each 
other's characters and antecedents.
<p>That something like such a neighborhood brawl occurred in this instance, we 
have little doubt. Two families, living in houses about 15 meters apart, had had 
altercations on various subjects. The defendant, whom the lower court describes 
in his decision as having the natural temperament, vehemence of expression, and 
other peculiar characteristics as indicate the kind of a woman that would stir 
up disturbances at the least provocation or whenever she feels offended, fanned 
the flame of her wrath with these quarrels. The resultâ€”defendant leaned from her 
window and hurled at the complainant offensive and scurrilous epithets, 
including words imputing unchastity to the mother and tending to injure the 
characters of her daughters.</p>
<p>The common scold was the denomination in by-gone days for women with loose 
and free tongues; their punishment was the ducking stool. The old common law 
rule was, that oral words imputing unchastity to a woman were not actionable 
without proof of special damage. After being denounced as barbarous by eminent 
English judges, this rule has, within recent years, been discarded in many 
progressive jurisdictions. In Great Britain, certain provinces of Canada, and 
certain States of the American Union, oral words imputing unchastity are per se 
actionable. The Spanish law reaches an identical conclusion.</p>
<p>"The imputation of vice or lack of morality, the consequences of which may 
greatly damage the fame, credit or interest of the offended party, being a 
serious insult (<em>injuria grave</em>) according to article 472; and the words 
which the accused hurled against her to the effect that the 'later's house was 
one of ill fame,' thereby undoubtedly prejudiced her name, fame, and credit, as 
they attributed lack of morality in her habits which belittles her in the public 
eye, etc." (Decisions of the supreme court of Spain of November 22, 1873, and of 
February 4, 1878; Viada, <em>Codigo Penal</em>, vol. 3, pp. 222 <em>et 
seq.</em>) </p>
<p>Under the Libel Law, a similar rule prevails in the Philippines. (U. S. 
<em>vs.</em> Grino [1917], 36 Phil. Rep., 738.)<br><br>Two decisions of this 
court are brought to our notice. In the United States <em>vs</em>. Ganzon 
([1915] 30 Phil., 1), the defendant and appellant was convicted of a 
misdemeanor, instead of the crime of <em>injurias graves</em>, on the ground 
principally that the offensive language was not intended to be taken in its 
literal sense and neither of the parties so understood it. But in the United 
States <em>vs</em>. Canleon ([1908] 11 Phil., 215), a man was convicted of 
<em>injurias graves</em> because of insulting words said to a woman.</p>
<p>Our present facts follow rather the latter case than the former. The language 
used by the defendant was deliberately applied by her to the complaint. The 
words were uttered with evident intent to injure complainant, to ruin her 
reputation, and to hold her in public contempt, for the sake of revenge. One who 
will thus seek to impute vice or immorality to another, the consequences of 
which might gravely prejudice the reputation of the person insulted, in this 
instance, apparently an honorable and respectable lady and her young daughters, 
all prominent in social circles, deserves little judicial sympathy. Certainly, 
it is time for the courts to put the stamp of their disapproval on this practice 
of vile and loud slander, which so debauches and degrades womanhood. Shrews must 
be tamed in the modern Philippines just as they were in the lines of 
Shakespeare. The words of the Good Book in Proverbs xxi, can also be read "with 
profit.</p>
<p>Article 457, Nos. 2 and 3, in connection with article 458, last paragraph, of 
the Penal Code, define such grave insults and provide for their punishment. In 
accordance with these provisions of the law, the judgment of the lower court is 
modified by sentencing the defendant and appellant to destierro (banishment), to 
be served 25 kilometers beyond the municipality of Donsol, Province of Sorsogon, 
for the period of one year eight months and twenty-one days, to pay a fine of 
325 pesetas, or to suffer subsidiary destierro in case of insolvency, and to pay 
the costs. So ordered.</p><em>Arellano, C, J., Johnson, Araullo</em>, and 
<em>Street, JJ.,</em> concur. <br><br><br>
<hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1">

<p><strong>CARSON, J.,</strong> concurring:</p>
<p>I concur. I think it well, however, to indicate that in my opinion there is 
no real conflict in the doctrine announced in this case and the cases of the 
United States <em>vs</em>. Ganzon (30 Phil. Rep., 1).</p>
<p>In the case of United States <em>vs</em>. Ganzon decided in 1916 
(<em>supra</em>) we said in the language of the syllabus,</p>
<p>"The use of insulting language in the course of a wordy brawl is a 
misdemeanor, and does not constitute the crime of <em>injurias graves</em> 
(grave insults) when there is reason to believe that the offensive language was 
not intended to be taken in its literal sense, and that neither of the parties 
so understood it," and in the body of the opinion we said; "after a careful 
review of all the evidence of record we think it is clear that the defendant, a 
woman who kept a tienda in her native town, had a bitter altercation with the 
complaining witness of this case, a woman named Maximina Mina; that in the 
course of this quarrel offensive and scurrilous epithets were hurled by each of 
the parties against the other in the heat of passion and without taking thought 
of the highly offensive character of the language used. We are satisfied that 
this offensive language was not intended to be taken in its literal sense, and 
that neither of the parties so understood it. They seem simply to have searched 
their memories for insulting and offensive expressions by which they could 
relieve their feelings of rage and animosity. Doubtless if some of the language 
used were deliberately applied by one woman with reference to another, it would 
constitute the grave insults (<em>injurias graves</em>) mentioned in the 
statute, but we think that used as this language was, without any reference to 
its real meaning and under all the circumstances, it should be treated rather as 
language constituting the misdemeanor defined and penalized in article 589 of 
the Penal Code."</p>
<p>The court in the present case having found that "the language used by the 
defendant was deliberately applied by her to the complainant;" and that the 
words were "uttered with evident intent to injure the complainant and ruin her 
reputation," and that the accused sought "to impute vice and immorality * * * to 
an honorable and respectable lady and her young daughters;" there can be no 
question that the doctrine of the former case is not applicable in the present 
case.</p>
<p>The cases are distinguished upon the facts and not upon the law by which they 
are governed.</p></div>
