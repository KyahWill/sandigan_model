				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. CO CHICUYCO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>MAPA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The complaint charges the herein defendant with a violation of the Weights and Measures Act, committed as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"That the said Chinaman, Co Chicuyco, the accused, did, on or before the 10th of January, 1910, in the pueblo of Bautista of the Province of Pangasinan, alter with fraudulent intent a  cavan measure of 25 liters bearing the  tag number 493-895, after it had been officially sealed, so that said cavan  represents a larger  measure than  it really is; an act constituting such violation of the Weights and Measures Act  as is defined and  punished by section 30 of Act No. 1519,  and executed within the  jurisdiction  of this Court of First Instance; in violation  of law."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The case having come  to trial, the court, upon the evidence submitted, sentenced the defendant to the penalty of three months' imprisonment and a fine of P200, or to  the corresponding  subsidiary imprisonment in case of  insolvency, and  to  pay the costs of the trial.   The defendant appealed from  this judgment.</p>
<p>It is a proven fact that the measure which is alleged to have been altered and which constitutes  the subject of the crime charged  in the present case, was officially inspected and sealed in or about the month of February, 1909.  When this measure was inspected  by the official sealer of weights and measures,  Rafael  Puzon, on January 10,  1910, it was found to be larger by  about 2 millimeters than the official standard and consequently had  a greater capacity than it should have had in accordance with the said standard.  This excess was  formed, as is  stated in the Attorney-General's brief, by a  kind of <i>calzo  </i>or chock about 2 millimeters in thickness placed between the base or bottom and the boards of its four sides, so that, by means of this chock, the said bottom was lowered and  the measure acquired a greater. depth, which may be represented by 2 millimeters multiplied by the four sides of its base.</p>
<p>The real question to decide, in  our opinion, is whether the measure was, at the time it  was inspected and sealed, what it is at the present time, or whether, on the contrary, the chock  which represents the excess in its capacity wa3 put in after the measure had  been  officially sealed.  To begin with, there is no positive evidence that the latter was the case.  It has not been proved  in a  certain  and positive manner that, when the said measure was sealed, it did not already have the chock it now has; the prosecution  merely presumes or deduces this fact, from the very fact that the measure has a greater capacity than  the official standard. It appears that this deduction is founded on the presumption that every measure officially inspected and sealed is or ought  to be exactly  equal to the  official  standard;  but, aside from the fact that it is unlawful to convict anybody on a mere presumption based on another presumption, it is a fact that this presumption of the  prosecution has been destroyed by the evidence to the contrary presented  by the defense.</p>
<p>That evidence consists in a measure of 25 liters'  capacity, sealed by the municipal treasurer of Bautista several months prior to the trial  of the case.  It was shown to the said treasurer, who testified that  it had actually been sealed  by himself and that  he  did not observe in  it  the least sign of alteration; that is, that said measure then had the same appearance and was  exactly in  the  same  condition  as when he sealed it.   But when this measure was examined by the treasurer himself in the presence  of the court,  it was found to be  greater in  capacity  by about 2 millimeters than the official standard (just like the measure here in question), which demonstrates one of two things: , either  that  not all the measures  sealed  have  exactly, on being sealed, the capacity they should have in conformity with the official standard, which might very well occur through carelessness or neglect on the part of the persons concerned in the operation, especially when the difference is small  or  insignificant;  or that, the contrary being the case, they may undergo,  as in fact they do sometimes, an alteration in their capacity through the natural phenomenon of the  expansion of the wood, for example, without  man's       intervention, such alteration, therefore, not being chargeable to anyone.</p>
<p>The court says  in  the judgment appealed  from that this evidence is in no manner decisive for the reason that the measure presented by the defense is as illegal as that on  which the complaint  is based  and,  consequently, like the latter, might have been  tampered  with.  This  point of view  in the judgment does  not appear to  us to be correct.  It is not a question here of setting up mere conjectures or possibilities; this case has no concern with what <i>might</i> have been done, but with what was really and actually done  in connection with the measure in question, and on this point the testimony of the municipal treasurer  is positive to the effect that no alteration whatever was made in the condition and materials of the said  measure.  And as to the latter being illegal,  if by this word is meant that the measure has a greater capacity than  that prescribed by law, it is not a good reason for not giving the  evidence its due weight,  inasmuch as the purpose  of that evidence is precisely to prove that such illegality can and in fact does exist through no fault whatever imputable to the possessor of the measure said to be illegal.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is proven  by the uncontradicted testimony of one witness that the chock with which the measure in question  was provided,  was  put in  before  the latter was officially sealed.  This witness is the carpenter who made or manufactured the said measure.   He testified that it was he who put in the chock referred to, and that he did so in the office of the municipal president of Bautista, by the order of one Garcia and in the latter's presence.  He added that the measure was then, at the time he was testifying, exactly in the same condition as when  he  put in  the  chock and that it showed no sign whatever of alteration.  This Garcia, to whom the witness alluded and who is now deputy provincial treasurer of Pangasinan, was the inspector of weights and measures at the time when the measure herein concerned was sealed,  and he corroborates  in  a way the testimony given  by the witness, for he stated that several Chinamen  had presented  to  him  measures  of 75 and 25 liters,  the  capacity of which was less than  that of the standard measure; that,  in order to  correct the shortage, he had permitted  these  Chinamen to  put in  chocks, and that it was the preceding witness who put in the chocks in his presence in the office of the president of the municipality,  but he was  unable to state  exactly whether the measure concerned in this case was one of those so fixed.</p>
<p>In view  of the  foregoing facts, we can  not hold that it has been  proven  that  the defendant did fraudulently alter  the  measure herein concerned,  after it  had  been sealed, which is the act expressly charged against him in the complaint.</p>
<p>Therefore, the  judgment appealed from is reversed and the  defendant acquitted,  with the costs of both  instances <em>de oficio</em>.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Johnson,  Carson, Moreland,</em> and <em>Trent, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><strong>TORRES, J.,</strong> dissenting:</p>
<p>I am of the opinion that the judgment should be affirmed.<br></p>
