				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, COMPLAINANT  AND APPELLEE, VS. JOSE RAMOS ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.
  
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Anacleta, the daughter  of Jose Ramos,  having defied Pascual  Rodriguez to come  out  of his house,  the latter left it and upon tin? stairway met Jose and his three sons. Mariano and Rufino  were  in front and Joso and Andres behind them.  Pascual  was  attacked by Mariano with a bolo and  by Rufino with a club.   He  lost his left hand by a  blow from the  bolo,  and was knocked senseless  to the ground by a blow from the club given by Rufino.  The court below acquitted Jose and Andres, and the case is not before us as to them.   Mariano  was  sentenced  to  four years nine months and eleven days' imprisonment  because his blow deprived the complaining witness  of  his hand; and Rufino was sentenced to four months'  imprisonment because his blow  only  caused  a contusion  on  the  head. In thus discriminating between the two we think that the court erred.  The two defendants attacked Pascual at the same  time; they were joint participants in the aggression and each is responsible for  the result,  (Art.  13, Penal Code.)</p>
<p>The aggravating circumstance of noeturnity should not be taken into consideration, for it is evident from the case that the defendants did not select the hour of 8 p. m. for the commission of the offense because it was then dark.</p>
<p>There  being  neither  aggravating nor extenuating circumstances, the penalty should be inflicted in the medium grade.</p>
<p>The judgment is reversed and each of the  defendants is converted of <em>lesiones graves</em>, defined and punished in article 416, 2, of the Penal Code, and sentenced to the penalty of four years nine months and ten  days of <em>prision correccional</em>, to pay Pasenal  Kodrignez an indemnity of 500 Philippine  pesos,  and to half  of the costs of the first instance and the costs of this instance.</p>
<p> <em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Cooper, Mapa,</em> and <em>McDonough, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
