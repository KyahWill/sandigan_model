				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an action based upon the alleged usurpation of a public office, that 
of governor of the Province of Rizal, in which a demurrer was filed to the 
complaint. The question before us arises on the issues framed by the 
demurrer.
<p>After setting out the election of the defendant, the complaint alleges that: 
"The plaintiff duly began a contest in the Court of First Instance of Rizal 
against the said election, and, while the said contest was pending decision, the 
defendant took possession of the office to which he was elected on the 16th of 
October, 1916, by virtue of a certificate of election issued to him by the board 
of provincial canvassers, which certificate of election was the subject of 
controversy in the election contest."</p>
<p>The complaint further alleges that: "The protest was decided by the Court of 
First Instance on the 14th day of January, 4018 votes while the defendant was 
found to have received only 3,317 voes, that is to say, that the plaintiff was 
the one who received a plurality of the legal votes cast at the said election; 
and the court ordered, in consequence, that the provincial board, as the 
provincial board of canvassers, correct its canvass in accordance with the 
decision of the court."</p>
<p>The complaint avers that: "In view of the decision referred to, the plaintiff 
notified the defendant that he was ready to qualify and to assume possession of 
the office and demanded that he quit the office and deliver it to the plaintiff; 
but that the defendant refused to do so."</p>
<p>Upon these facts plaintiff asserts in his complaint that: "The defendant is 
retaining and usurping the office in question to the great injury of the 
plaintiff and to the detriment of the public interest;" and maintains that: "the 
plaintiff has the right, by virtue of the decision of the Court of First 
Instance above mentioned, to take possession of and exercise the duties of the 
office, and the defendant, by virtue of said decision, has lost his right to 
occupy it, and is at the present time in possession thereof without right."</p>
<p>A demurrer was filed to the complaint on the ground that: "The allegation of 
the complaint fail to show that the plaintiff is entitled to occupy the office 
and discharge the duties of the office now held by the defendant;" and that: 
"The facts set out in the complaint are not sufficient to constitute a cause of 
action as they do not show that the defendant is usurping or illegally retaining 
possession of the office in question."</p>
<p>We are of the opinion that the demurrer must be sustained. The complaint does 
not show that the plaintiff was entitled to the office or that the defendant is 
illegally in possession thereof. Section 197 of the Code of Civil Procedure 
provides that: "A civil action may be brought in the name of the Government of 
the Philippine Islands: (1) Against a person who usurps, intrudes into, or 
unlawfully holds or exercises a public civil office;" and that such action may 
be commenced by any "person claiming to be entitled to a public office, 
unlawfully held and exercised by another." Section 202 declares that: "When the 
action is against a person for usurping an office, the complaint shall set forth 
the name of the person who claims to be entitled thereto, with an averment of 
his right to the same; and that the defendant is unlawfully in possession of the 
same; and judgment may be rendered upon the right of the defendant, and also 
upon the right of the person so averred to be entitled, or only upon the right 
of the defendant, as justice requires."</p>
<p>Section 207 determines the form and nature of the judgment to be rendered in 
this class of action. It provides that: "When the defendant is found guilty of 
usurping, intruding into, or unlawfully holding or exercising an office, * * * 
judgment shall be rendered that such defendant be ousted and altogether excluded 
therefrom, and that the relator or plaintiff, as the case may be, recover his 
costs."</p>
<p>This court has held on several occasions, in applying that portion of the 
Election Law referring to the election of provincial governors, that a person is 
not entitled to occupy the office of provincial governor until his election has 
been duly proclaimed by the provincial board of canvassers and a certificate of 
election has been issued to him in pursuance of that proclamation (Manalo 
<em>vs</em>. Sevilla, 24 Phil. Rep., 609). The certificate of election is the 
credential which proves his right to exercise the functions of the office and 
admits him into possession thereof.</p>
<p>Section 1999 of the Administrative Code provides in effect that a person 
holding a public office shall continue to possess and exercise the functions of 
the same until his successor is elected and qualifies. By virtue of this statute 
one who occupies a public office is required to maintain possession thereof 
until his successor is elected and qualifies. If he turns the office over to a 
person who was not duly elected and who has not qualified he is acting in 
violation of law and will be responsible for the loss of money or property 
occasioned by such transfer. While section 209 of the Code of Civil Procedure 
provides that a plaintiff in an action of quo warranto may be declared entitled 
to the office in question before he has taken the oath of office or executed the 
official bond required by law, that fact is not in conflict with our opinion 
that the plaintiff in the present action must go so far as to allege in his 
complaint and prove on the trial that he was duly elected to the office in 
dispute.</p>
<p>The complaint rests the plaintiff's right to the office exclusively upon the 
decision of the Court of First Instance in the election contest. That right is 
not based on a proclamation of the provincial board of canvassers or on a 
certificate of election issued pursuance thereof. There is no allegation in the 
complaint that the provincial board of canvassers corrected its canvass in 
accordance with the decision of the Court of First Instance, or that, after such 
correction, that body duly proclaimed the plaintiff elected to the office in 
question. Neither is there an allegation that a certificate of election was duly 
issued to the plaintiff in pursuance of such proclamation. Plaintiff's right to 
the office, according to his own allegations, rests exclusively on the judgment 
of the Court of First Instance referred to.</p>
<p>This court has held on several occasions (Topacio <em>vs</em>. Paredes, 23 
Phil. Rep., 238; Hontiveros <em>vs</em>. Altavas, 24 Phil. Rep., 632) that a 
Court of First Instance in an election contest has no authority to declare any 
one elected to the office to which the contest relates. Its sole duty is to 
order the provincial board of canvassers to correct its return. Its judgment, 
therefore, is not proof of plaintiff's election. Moreover, it is subject to 
appeal. In fact, the judgment of the court in this case was appealed and that 
appeal is now pending in this court.</p>
<p>It is our opinion, therefore, that the complaint does not show either that 
the plaintiff is entitled to the office or that the defendant is usurping the 
same.</p>
<p>Although it is not mentioned as ground of demurrer and has not been presented 
or discussed, it is a grave question, even conceding that this action is 
maintainable under any theory, whether the complaint is not demurrable on the 
ground that there is another action pending between the same parties for the 
same cause. An election contest determines finally the right of the contestant 
as well as of each of the respondents to the office contested. While the contest 
does not determine the eligibility of the candidate for office, it determines 
who was elected to the office contested. It will be observed that the complaint 
in this action is not based on the ineligibility of the defendant but seeks to 
determine who was elected to the office of provincial governor of the Province 
of Rizal in the last election. That question will be finally and conclusively 
determined in the election contest; and an action of quo warranto to determine 
the same question would seem to be unnecessary and burdensome.</p>
<p>It is clear to us that, although the question has not been raised or 
discussed, this action is not maintainable under any theory. Section 27 of Act 
1582 provides a method for the determination of election contests which is 
exclusive of every other remedy; and to the extent that it is applicable has 
modified the Code of fCivil Procedure dealing with actions founded upon the 
usurpation of public office. The case of Navarro <em>vs</em>. Gimenez (10 Phil. 
Rep., 226) is similar to the case before us. There the election was contented 
under section 27 of Act No. 1582. Immediately after the decision of the court 
had been rendered in that contest an action of usurpation was begun under the 
provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure to which we have referred. The Supreme 
Court in that case decided the very question to which we have adverted. It 
said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is very evident that the Legislature intended to provide a summary and 
exclusive way for determining the facts in relation to certain elections held 
under the law. It is expressly provided by section 27 that the decision of the 
Court of First Instance shall be final and conclusive. No appeal is allowed from 
that decision. In the present plaintiff was a party thereto. He had an 
opportunity to try and have decided the very questions which he now asks to have 
decided by this court in this proceeding. Those questions were, in fact, tried 
and decided in the court below and if this action can be maintained it would 
amount to an allowance of an appeal from the judgment of the court below in the 
election proceeding, the very thing which section 27 prohibits.</p>
<p>"It cannot be believed that the Legislature, after providing a special and 
exclusive manner for determining the facts in an election case, and after 
declaring that determination should be final, intended that the defeated party 
should have a right to try the same questions over again by virtue of the 
provisions of section 201, above quoted. That the provisions of section 201 have 
been modified to some extent by the Election Law is very clear. Whether or not 
it still remains in force and may be availed of by a defeated candidate, who 
claims that the possessor of an office is not entitled thereto for some reason 
not connected with the method of casting and counting the votes, we do not 
decide. We do decide, however, that it has been so far modified that no person 
claiming a right to a public office can now maintain an action by virtue of this 
section when the grounds alleged by him in his complaint relate to the facts 
which the Court of First Instance in proceedings under said section 27 had 
acquired a right to and did determine."</p></blockquote>
<p>This decision would seem to be conclusive of right to maintain the present 
action.</p>
<p>In closing we call attention to the fact that unless the special remedies 
mentioned in Chapter IX of the Code of Civil Procedure are directed against the 
Court of First Instance itself, the Supreme Court will usually require the 
proceeding to be brought in the Court of First Instance is better adapted to the 
trial of these special remedies than is the Supreme Court; and we regard it as 
the better practice to begin the proceedings to obtain such remedies in the 
trial court in the first instance. This is especially true where the 
determination of the questions presented would require the taking of 
evidence.</p>
<p>The demurrer is sustained and unless the complaint is amended within five 
days the action will be finally dismissed with costs. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres</em>, and <em>Araullo, JJ.</em>, concur.</p><em>Trent, J.,</em> 
concurs in the result. <br><br><br>
