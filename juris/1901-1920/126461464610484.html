				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On the  20th  of April, 1902, Charles  E. Manison, inspector of Constabulary, together with Pablo del Rosario, Pablo Reyes, and Cayetano Bacleon, Constabulary soldiers, together with a spy, went to a place called Caignin, near  the  town of Caloocan,  to a house  in which a man called Andres was living, for the purpose of arresting the latter.  This was at about 7 o'clock in the morning.   They did not  succeed  in arresting Andres  because  the  latter, who,  at  the time of their  approach, was eating, jumped up, and,  seizing a revolver,  ran  away,  jumping  to the ground from the porch of the house.  They were unable to overtake him, although he was followed.  They returned to the house and arrested all  whom they found  there and proceeded to conduct them  to this city.   On  the  road, however, at a place called  Matalahip,  they were attacked at a street corner which they were  passing by several men, among whom they recognized Andre's, the accused, Nicasio Sevilla, and Marcelo Magsalin, who fired at them several times, the result of the shooting being the death of Cayetano Bacleon.</p>
<p>The facts constituted the crime  of homicide, defined in article 404.  together with  an armed attack  upon agents of the authorities in the  exercise of the duties of their office, defined and punished in articles  249 and  250  of the Penal  Code, although  the  latter offense does not  appear to be charged in the information  filed by the  provincial fiscal.  The  offense was committed by several  men, who, armed with carbines or guns, intercepted  five members of the Constabulary who were returning to this  city from the place where they had attempted to  arrest one Andres, who succeeded  in making  his escape and attacked  them by repeatedly firing upon  the officers, the  result of the attack being the death of Cayetano Bacleon by a gunshot wound received in the head.</p>
<p>The record discloses the  fact that Andres, immediately after  having  succeeded in  escaping from the police who were attempting  to arrest  him, undertook to attack the latter, in company with the other aggressors, among them the accused, Nieasio Sevilla, with the purpose of preventing his companions, who had  been arrested  in the house, from being taken  to this city or to  revenge himself for his own attempted  arrest.   This was upon an express  agreement, even if entered into  upon the spur  of the moment, all  of them  having united for the exclusive purpose of attacking the police.   To  that end they stationed  themselves at the corner of the street, through which the  police were passing and attacked them, each assisting and cooperating with the others, with the express intent to  commit the said crimes of attack upon the authorities and homicide, the latter being the only  one which is now the subject of this prosecution.  Therefore, there was no confused and tumultuous quarrel or affray, nor was there a reciprocal aggression between both parties, inasmuch as the police  simply defended themselves from the simultaneous and uniform attack upon them by  the  aggressors, each one of whom, therefore, became responsible for the homicide in question, as all of them, with malicious intent to do harm, took part in the aggression upon the said policemen, one of whom was killed.</p>
<p>Consequently this was not homicide in a confused and tumultuous affray, as the court below regarded the crime charged.  The violent  killing of the policeman, Cayetano Bacleon, constitutes the offense of homicide, of which the accused, Nicasio Sevilla, is one of the persons responsible, as he, in company with Andres and Marcelo Magsalin, took direct part in the attack which they together, and by means of firearms, made upon the said police.   In the commission of the  offense we must  consider  the aggravating circumstance of the use of prohibited arms, which  private parties are not allowed to have in their possession.   There are no  mitigating circumstances, and therefore the proper penalty should be imposed in the maximum degree.</p>
<p>On these grounds we are therefore of  the opinion that the judgment below should be  reversed and that Nicasio Sevilla, as guilty of the offense of  homicide, should be convicted and sentenced to seventeen years four months and one day of <em>reclusion temporal</em>, together with the accessories designated in article 50 of the Code, to the payment of one  thousand Mexican pesos  to the widow and heirs of the deceased, and to  the payment of the costs in both instances.</p>
<p><em>Arellano. C. J., Cooper, Willard, Mapa,</em> and <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em> McDonough, J.,</em> did not sit in this case.</p>
