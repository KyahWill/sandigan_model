				<BR><STRONG>COOPER, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Marcelo de Guzman is charged with the murder of Pelagio Bonifacio with <em>alevosia</em> and premeditation, and was convicted in the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan under article 403 of the Penal Code and sentenced to imprisonment at hard labor in the public prison of Pangasinan  for the period of his natural life, and to pay to the widow of the deceased, Bonifacio, the sum of 1,000 pesos, and to pay the costs of this suit.  An application has been made for the discharge of the accused under the provisions of the amnesty granted  by the President of the United States by his proclamation of the 4th of July, 1902.</p>
<p>It is stated in the application that the accused is a Filipino and that the  crime was committed by him while taking part in the insurrection against the Spanish Government  in these Islands,  and that  the offense has the character of a political crime committed during the course of the  insurrection, in obedience to orders given by the military  authority of the insurrection,  or,  at  least, the offense was committed as the result of internal political feuds and dissensions among the Filipinos; that the death of the deceased was not committed through any personal motive, and therefore the accused is comprehended in the proclamation of amnesty, and  asks this court that he be placed at liberty after his taking and subscribing the oath of allegiance prescribed in the amnesty proclamation.</p>
<p>The testimony in the case shows that the defendant, Marcelo de Guzman, was a captain  in the insurgent army  and had many posts under his command, and often visited the pueblo  of Binmaley during the time that the insurgents occupied that pueblo.  That upon one occasion on one of iiis visits  there, about  the time the  Spanish army surrendered at  Dagupan, the deceased,  Pelagio Bonifacio, was brought before Guzman, the defendant, charged as a  spy of the Spaniards; that deceased was interrogated by Guzman  and admitted that  he was a spy,  whereupon  the defendant, after assaulting and abusing  him, ordered a couple of soldiers under his command to carry the deceased to the cemetery near by, there to be killed. The order was duly executed by the soldiers.</p>
<p>The defendant testified  in the case  and stated that his action was based on an order given by one Vicente Prado, his superior in command, who directed him to look out for a spy in the pueblo of  Binmaley and when found to have him executed; that the deceased was captured and brought before him, and having been asked whether he was a spy or  not answered  in the affirmative,  and  thereupon he reported the circumstances back to Vicente Prado,  who ordered the defendant to kill the deceased.</p>
<p>This statement as to the defendant having received direct orders from Vicente Prado for the execution  of  the deceased is not borne out by the testimony of  the witnesses, who state  that no sooner had the deceased been brought in the presence of the  defendant than the deceased  was struck by the defendant and ordered to  be  taken off  and shot.</p>
<p>However, it appears beyond doubt that the commission of the offense was done by the defendant as an officer in the insurgent army, and that it grew out of internal political feuds and dissensions between Filipinos and Spaniards or out of the political  feuds and dissensions among the Filipinos themselves during the Spanish insurrection.</p>
<p>Following the cases decided at the present term of  this court of the United States <em>vs.</em> Vicente Villamor;  United States <em>vs.</em> Ariastasio Carmona; United States <em>vs.</em> Jose Guzman et al., it must be held that the  defendant brings himself within the amnesty proclamation of the President,  and that he is  entitled to be discharged upon his taking  and subscribing the oath prescribed in the  amnesty proclamation before any authority in the Philippine Archipelago authorized  to administer oaths.  Upon  such oath being presented to this court the defendant will be ordered  discharged from custody.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J.,</em> and <em>Torres, J.,</em> concur.</p>
<p>WILLARD, J., with whom concur Smith and Ladd, JJ., <em>concurring</em>:</p>
<p>We concur in the result in this case,  inasmuch as the accused acted under orders from  his superior,  Vicente Prado.  The testimony of the accused that Prado told him to watch for the deceased and to execute him when found has not been contradicted.</p>
