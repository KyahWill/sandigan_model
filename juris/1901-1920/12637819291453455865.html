				<BR><STRONG>COOPER, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The defendants, Cornelio Devela and Silvestre Absolio, are charged
with the crime of robbery with homicide, denned and punished under
clause No. 1, article 503 of the Penal Code, and were on the 22d day of
September, 1903, found guilty. The aggravating circumstances of <em>alevosia</em> and <em>despoblado</em> were applied and the defendants sentenced by the Court of First Instance to the death penalty.
<p>From the evidence it appears that Luis Oleta, the deceased, was sent
by his master to the town of Mauban to take 500 pesos to the store of
his principal, and while on the way with the money, on arriving at a
place near the shore of the Sabang River, the accused, Cornelio Devela
and Silvestre Absolio, armed with a bolo and dagger, seeing
that Oleta carried money, approached him and demanded that he deliver
it to them. Oleta resisted, throwing a stone at Absolio. Oleta was then
attacked by the defendants and wounded, from the effects of which he
died a short time afterwards. The body of the deceased showed that he
was wounded seven times, six of which were mortal wounds.</p>
<p>The testimony of the prosecution consisted of statements made by the
defendants at the time of their capture and also the testimony of the
defendant Absolio on the trial of the case.</p>
<p>In his testimony Silvestre Absolio stated that he and his
codefendant, Devela, went out from the barrio of Tubigan for the
purpose of getting some clothes which he had ordered from a tailor;
that after they had crossed the Sabang River, they met the deceased,
Luis Oleta, carrying a sack of money; that they immediately concluded
to rob him; that on approaching the deceased the deceased refused to
deliver the money to him and offered resistance by throwing a stone
which struck him on the thigh; that they struck the deceased blows with
a bolo until the money fell from his hand, when they seized it and
fled; that at the time they did not know whether the deceased was armed
or not; that he was about their size and strength; that the witness is
22 years old and his codefendant is 18 years of age; that he was
accustomed to carry the dagger which he had on that occasion; he
testified that his companion, Devela, was the first to wound the
deceased. It does not appear whether the bolo used by Devela was the
ordinary bolo used in working or was of the prohibited character.</p>
<p>The evidence shows clearly the guilt of the defendants. </p>
<p>The question to be determined is whether the aggravating circumstances found to exist by the trial court, to wit, <em>alevosia</em> and <em>despoblado,</em>
which had the effect of raising the penalty from the medium degree,
punishable by life imprisonment, to the maximum degree, punishable by
death, are sufficiently shown in the case.</p>
<p> By the provisions of article 10, No. 2, Penal Code, <em>alevosia</em>
exists: "When the culprit commits any crime against persons, employing
means, methods, or forms in the execution thereof which tend to
directly and specially insure it without risk to the person of the
criminal arising from the defense the injured party might make."</p>
<p>The defendant Absolio testified that at the time of the attack he
did not know whether Luis Oleta, the deceased, was armed or not. Had
the deceased been armed with a revolver or bolo, not only might he have
caused risk to the defendants, but he might have successfully repelled
their attack and killed his assailants. Besides it is shown by
the testimony of the defendant Absolio that the deceased made a defense
by throwing a stone and striking the defendant on the thigh. But it is
not necessary to prove that there was or was not a defense actually
made. This would make the existence of the aggravating circumstance
depend upon the result of the aggression.</p>
<p>It appears from the evidence that the attack was sudden, without
premeditation, and evidently made without taking into consideration the
risk which the defendants incurred in committing the robbery. Their
purpose was to possess themselves of the money carried by the
deceased, without regard to consequences, and without any preparation
directly and specially tending to insure them against risk, such as
exists where the culprit lies in wait or approaches from behind,
unseen; or where an attack is made upon a sleeping person; or where the
act of taking life was distinct and separate from that of overpowering
the injured party, or after possessing his arms or assuring themselves
that he was unarmed. Nor do we think that the evidence was sufficient
to show that the crime was committed in an uninhabited place. There is
entire absence of proof in the record as to whether there were persons
living near the scene of the encounter; but it does appear that the
brother of the deceased approached the place directly after
he wounding of the deceased, and that it was but a short time after the
occurrence before officers of the law were in pursuit of the defendants.</p>
<p>It has been stated that No. 9, article 10 of the Penal Code should be applied as an aggravating circumstance.</p>
<p>It reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"9. When advantage is taken of superior strength, or means are employed to weaken the defense."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This circumstance was not considered by the Court of First Instance
nor do we think it sufficiently well marked in the proof to require its
application. An illustration of the cases which fall within this
provision is where, for example, a strong man has ill treated a child,
an old or decrepit person, or one weakened by disease; or where a
person's physical strength has been overcome by the use of drugs or
intoxicants. In each of these cases there is a marked difference of
physical strength. The case of employment of means to weaken the
defense is illustrated by the case of where one struggling with another
suddenly throws a cloak over the head of his opponent and while in this
situation he wounds or kills him.</p>
<p>As to whether the mere fact of two or more attacking a single person
is of itself sufficient to show a superiority of strength within the
meaning of this provision, the decisions of the supreme court of Spain,
construing this provision of the law, seem to be in conflict.</p>
<p>It is impossible to establish fixed and invariable rules upon such
questions. The mere fact of there being a superiority of numbers is not
sufficient to bring the case within this provision.</p>
<p>In the absence of aggravating circumstances the defendants should be
found guilty, and the punishment assessed should be in the medium
degree. The Court of First Instance erroneously found and applied the
aggravating circumstances before considered, which raised the crime to
the maximum penalty and punishable by death. The sentence of the Court
of First Instance must be reversed and reformed, and the defendants
convicted arid sentenced for the offense of robbery and homicide in its
medium degree, punishable by life imprisonment.</p>
<p>We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of First Instance,
and now here sentence the defendants, Cornelio Devela and Silvestre
Absolio, to the penalty of life imprisonment, with indemnity to the
relatives of the deceased who are entitled to receive the same in the
sum of 1,000 Philippine pesos, and to the costs of the proceedings.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C.J., Torres, Mapa, McDonough,</em> and <em>Johnson, JJ.,</em> concur.</p><hr no="" shade="" align="center" size="1" width="60%">
<p align="center"><em>DISSENTING</em></p>
<p><strong>WILLARD,</strong> <em>J.,</em></p>
<p>In my opinion the judgment of the court below should be affirmed,
upon the ground that the aggravating circumstance of abuse of
superiority existed. This view is sustained by the following decisions
of this court: United States <em>vs.</em> Teodoro, 1 Official Gazette, 396; United States <em>vs.</em> Jose, March 25, 1903.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span>
It is also supported by the decisions of the supreme court of Spain of
May 9, 1893, March'19, 1888, May 24, 1888, December 23, 1890, and
December 21, 1891.</p><hr no="" shade="" align="left" size="1" width="60%">
