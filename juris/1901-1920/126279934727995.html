				G.R. No. 3463, September 05, 1906</h4>
				<H3>JUANA FAJARDO, PETITIONER, VS. JULIO LLORENTE, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF NUEVA ECIJA, ET AL., RESPONDENTS.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Attorneys Buencamino  and Diokno presented to this court in behalf of Juana  Fajardo a petition for a writ of mandamus  to compel  the judge of the  Court  of  First Instance of Nueva Ecija, Julio  Llorente, to admit a complaint filed by  the  petitioner in the said court against Emiliano Soriano for the crime of seduction, and to hold the necessary preliminary investigation,  taxing the costs against the said Soriano.  The petition  alleges  that  the complaint in question was duly  filed and  that on the 11th of June of this  year the  respondent judge made an  order dismissing the same, with costs against  the complaining witness, on the ground that the penalty prescribed for the crime of seduction being  that of <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto  mayor</span>, the complaint should be presented to the justice of the peace of the town of Aliaga, where the crime was  committed.</p>
<p>The  complaining witness insisted in her claim, alleging new reasons why her complaint should be allowed, but the judge denied her petition  in view of the provisions of section 56, paragraph 6, of Act No. 136, known as the Organic Act, which fixes the jurisdiction of the  Courts  of  First Instance of these Islands, the indemnification for  which a person guilty of this offense could be held liable, being civil in character.</p>
<p>The petition alleges that there is  no other speedy or adequate remedy for the protection of her rights and asks this court for the issuance of a writ of mandamus.</p>
<p>The respondent judge demurred to the petition and asked that the same be dismissed with costs.</p>
<p>Section 515 of the Code  of Civil Procedure provides that the Supreme Court shall have jurisdiction  in  all cases where an  inferior tribunal,  corporation,  board, or person unlawfully neglects the performance of an act which the law specially enjoins as a  duty resulting from an office of trust or station, or  unlawfully excludes the plaintiff from the use and enjoyment of alright or office to which he is entitled, and from which he has been dispossessed by said inferior tribunal, etc.</p>
<p>Section 222 of the same  code provides in part as follows, if "the court, on trial, finds the allegations of the complaint to be true, it may,  if there is  no other plain, speedy,  and adequate remedy in the ordinary courts of law, render a judgment granting a peremptory  order against the defendant,"  etc.</p>
<p>So that if there is any other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy against the  order of the inferior tribunal, the writ of mandamus prayed for should not issue;  From the order of the Court of First Instance dismissing the complaint filed by Juana Fajardo with costs on  the ground that the justice of  the  peace  was the proper authority to take cognizance of the crime of seduction, punishable only with the penalty of <em>arresto mayor </em>an appeal could have been taken under the provisions  of section 107, in connection with sections 1 and 44 of General Orders, No. 58.  Consequently the petitioner has no  right to pray for a writ of mandamus against the judge who dismissed her complaint on the ground that the same should be filed with the justice of the peace who had competent jurisdiction over the crime charged.</p>
<p>The demurrer of the respondent to the petition is hereby sustained and the application of Juana Fajardo for a writ of mandamus is denied, the petitioner to pay the costs.</p>
<p>After the expiration of ten days let judgment be entered in accordance herewith.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Mapa, Carson, Willard,</em> and<em> Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
