				G.R. No. 3062, December 07, 1906</h4>
				<H3>MARIA MAGALLANES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. TEODORA CANETA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The plaintiff in  the court below  made a motion  for a new trial on the ground of newly  discovered evidence.  A denial of such motion  and an exception thereto do  not authorize this court to review the evidence upon which the judgment was  based.   No motion  for  a new trial was made upon the ground that the judgment was not justified by the evidence.   The only  question before us, therefore, is whether the facts admitted in the pleadings and those stated in the decision of the court below justify the judgment in favor of the defendant.  An examination of that decision  will  show  that the  result  at which the judge arrived was fully justified by the facts stated by him in his decision.</p>
<p>The cause of action arose in 1894 and the court below applied the statute of limitations found in the Civil Code. The appellant seems to claim in this court that the statute of limitations applicable is that found in the Code of Civil Procedure.  This  contention can not be sustained.   Section 38 provides  that the statute of  limitations found in that code is not applicable to causes of action that accrued prior to its promulgation.</p>
<p>The judgment of  the court  below is  affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.</p>
<p>After expiration of twenty days let judgment be entered in accordance herewith, and ten days thereafter let the case be remanded to the court  below for proper action.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Carson,</em> and<em> Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em>Johnson, J.,</em> did not sit in this case.<br>
