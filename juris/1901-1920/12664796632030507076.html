				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Clemente Pena at the time of his death was the owner of some&nbsp; real&nbsp; estate,&nbsp; cattle, and other&nbsp; personal&nbsp; property. Among his heirs he left a son named Pedro Pena.&nbsp; When the estate of Clemente Pena was divided, Pedro Pena had already died and his daughter, named Francisca Pena, received his portion of the inheritance.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was&nbsp; then a minor&nbsp; and a guardian, Ramon Ortiz, was appointed, and the latter&nbsp; took over and administered the property that had come to Francisca Pena, through her father, from the estate of the aforesaid Clemente Pena.&nbsp; Francisca Pena married Eulogio&nbsp; Tria and died March 2, 1902.<p> After the death of Francisca Pena, her surviving husband, Eulogio Tria, made application,&nbsp; on January 13, 1903, for the appointment of a judicial administrator&nbsp; for the intestate estate of his late wife,&nbsp; and was himself&nbsp; appointed.&nbsp;&nbsp; He presented an inventory of the&nbsp; property of the deceased, which inventory&nbsp; included seven parcels of&nbsp; land.&nbsp; But commissioners of appraisal&nbsp; were&nbsp; appointed&nbsp; and&nbsp; appraised thirty-four parcels, and there the proceedings of that administration terminated.</p><p> On January 18, 1907, Gavina Fernandez also made special application for the appointment of an administration for the property which Pedro Pefia had left at his decease, by a will executed and&nbsp; probated under the late sovereignty. and the petitioner herself, Gavina Fernandez, widow of the said Pedro Pena, was appointed.&nbsp; In the same instrument she asked for the partition of the estate of Pedro Pena, and there the proceedings terminated.</p><p> Later, on July 23, 1908, Gavina Fernandez, as such judicial administratrix, instituted the present suit praying for judgment in her favor and&nbsp; against the defendant for the ownership and possession&nbsp; of the property set forth in the complaint, for P2,000 damages and the costs.</p><p> The material facts of the complaint are: the third, wherein it&nbsp; is averred that the hereditary succession of the deceased Pedro Pena is the owner and is entitled to ownership and possession of the property which is then described, to wit,&nbsp; according to the fourth fact, seven parcels of rural land,&nbsp; and five horses, the condition of the&nbsp; latter being a matter of surmise (B. of e., 2 and 3);&nbsp; and&nbsp; the fifth, in which it is averred&nbsp; that&nbsp; the defendant Eulogio Tria,&nbsp; as judicial administrator of the property left by the deceased Francisca Pena (second fact) illegally retains, in his possession the property described in the complaint and claims to have rights therein adverse to those of the plaintiff.</p><p> In his reply the defendant confines himself to a generaldenial.</p><p> From the evidence adduced, the Court of First Instance of Ambos Camarines, which tried the case, decided it "in favor of the plaintiff&nbsp; in her capacity as administratrix for the deceased Pedro Pena, declaring that&nbsp; she&nbsp; was entitled&nbsp; to possession during the probate proceedings with reference to the real property described in the complaint and ordering the defendant to deliver it to her."&nbsp;&nbsp; (B. of e., 8 and 9).</p><p> The defendant prepared a bill of exceptions and appealed to this court, submitting the following assignments of error:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><ol><li>In&nbsp; having declared&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff-administratrix owner of the land sought.<br></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <li>&nbsp;In&nbsp; denying the&nbsp; request for a new trial on the ground that the judgment is not&nbsp; sustained by the evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </li></ol><p> With reference&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; first assignment, the trial court made no declaration&nbsp; of ownership.&nbsp; It merely stated the conclusion that the plaintiff, as administratrix of the estate of Pedro Pena, was entitled&nbsp; to possession of the property described in the complaint so that she might act as <em>administratrix during </em>the probate proceedings&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; estate of Pedro Pena, and that&nbsp; when the debts had been paid, if any existed, and said proceedings&nbsp; were terminated, the property remaining should be divided among the heirs; and judgment was rendered to this effect.</p><p> With reference to the second, no error was incurred in denying the request for a new trial, for the evidence adduced sufficiently sustains the conclusions in the judgment.</p><p> The trial court held the following facts to be proven:</p><ol><li> That Pedro Pena was the son of Clemente Pena,&nbsp; and that the latter died before the former.&nbsp; A fact admitted by the defendant.<br></li>&nbsp; <li> That the land described in&nbsp; the complaint belonged to Clemente Pena and, according to his will, said land belonged to Pedro Pena as heir, and for this reason it was&nbsp; delivered first to Ramon Ortiz&nbsp; as guardian of Francisca&nbsp; Pena&nbsp; and later to her, aided&nbsp; by her husband Eulogio Tria,&nbsp; in whose possession it now is as judicial administrator of the intestate estate of Francisca Pena.&nbsp; A fact not refuted by the defendant.<br></li>&nbsp; <li> That, according to the will of the deceased Pedro Pena, his&nbsp; widow&nbsp; Gavina&nbsp; Fernandez and his legitimate&nbsp; daughter Francisca Pena are his heirs</li></ol><p> The clause in the will of Pedro Pena wherein this testamentary disposition of his is made reads thus:&nbsp; "<em>Item</em>. - I affirm that&nbsp; I have been married three times: The first time to Dona Maria Ramirez, by whom I had six children, all now dead; the second&nbsp; time to Dona&nbsp; Petrona&nbsp; Fernandez, also dead,&nbsp; from&nbsp; which marriage&nbsp; we&nbsp; have a minor&nbsp; daughter named Francisca; and the third time to Dona Gavina Fernandez, by&nbsp; whom I have another&nbsp; son, named&nbsp; Ambrosio, <em>to whom I leave, as heirs by force of law,</em> one-half of all my property to my daughter <em>Francisca</em>, and the other <em>half</em> to my wife Gavina Fernandez and son Ambrosio."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>This son Ambrosio died after his father,&nbsp; and his rights of inheritance passed by operation of law&nbsp; to&nbsp; his mother Gavina Fernandez, a fact that does not appear to be contradicted by the oral evidence adduced.<br>&nbsp; <br>That&nbsp; the&nbsp; property described in the&nbsp; complaint is&nbsp; the same which&nbsp; appears in the&nbsp; inventory,&nbsp; presented by&nbsp; the appellant as&nbsp; remaining at the death of his wife Francisca Peiia,&nbsp; when&nbsp; he asked for the judicial&nbsp; administration of her intestate estate (Exhibit&nbsp; A of the plaintiff), the same which,&nbsp; together&nbsp; with other property, was enumerated in the&nbsp; inventory made by&nbsp; the&nbsp; commissioners of appraisal in said&nbsp; proceedings&nbsp; in the intestate&nbsp; succession of Francisca Pena (Exhibit B&nbsp; of&nbsp; the plaintiff), and&nbsp; finally&nbsp; the same which, together with other property, appears to have been turned over by the guardian of&nbsp; Francisca Peiia,&nbsp; Ramon Ortiz, to the attorney&nbsp; in fact&nbsp; of the married couple, Eulogio&nbsp; Tria&nbsp; and&nbsp; Francisca Pena&nbsp; (Exhibit&nbsp;&nbsp; C&nbsp; of&nbsp; the plaintiff).<br>&nbsp; <br>Therefore&nbsp; there&nbsp; is no&nbsp; justification for the request&nbsp; for a&nbsp; new trial on the ground&nbsp; that the judgment&nbsp; is not sustained&nbsp; by the evidence.<br>&nbsp; <br>It is. clearly&nbsp; established&nbsp; that Francisca&nbsp; Pena,&nbsp; instead of her father Pedro Pena,&nbsp; received all&nbsp; the&nbsp; property that the latter's father had left&nbsp; him, and that&nbsp; this property did not all belong&nbsp; to Francisca Pena, but only a&nbsp; half of it, according&nbsp; to&nbsp; the express&nbsp; disposition&nbsp; of Pedro Pena. The other half belonged to Gavina Fernandez, and in order to secure&nbsp; it,&nbsp; she instituted special proceedings wherein she was&nbsp; appointed&nbsp; judicial administratrix&nbsp; of&nbsp; the estate of her&nbsp; deceased husband, Pedro&nbsp; Pena,&nbsp; with&nbsp; the object and for&nbsp; the&nbsp; purpose the law&nbsp; fixes, in order to transmit the inheritance&nbsp; from the hands of him&nbsp; who leaves&nbsp; it at his death to those who, according to his wish or according to the&nbsp; provisions of law,.are&nbsp; entitled to&nbsp; receive it.</p><p> The&nbsp; law provides&nbsp; that, when a&nbsp; will&nbsp; has been&nbsp; proved and&nbsp; allowed,&nbsp; the court shall&nbsp; issue&nbsp; letters testamentary thereon to the person&nbsp; named&nbsp; as executor therein,&nbsp; if he accepts the trust and gives the bond required by law.&nbsp; The term "executor"&nbsp; in this Act shall include&nbsp; an administrator with the will annexed.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Code of Civ. Proc, sec. 641.)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>If no executor&nbsp; is named'in the will, or if a person dies intestate, the&nbsp; administration shall first be&nbsp; granted to the surviving husband or wife.&nbsp; (Ibid., 642.)<br>&nbsp; <br>In appointing&nbsp; as administratrix for the estate of the deceased, Pedro&nbsp; Pefia&nbsp; his&nbsp; widow Gavina&nbsp; Fernandez the court acted in conformity&nbsp; with these legal provisions.<br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; The law further provides that "every executor or administrator, unless he is residuary&nbsp; legatee and has given the bond prescribed&nbsp; for the residuary&nbsp; legatee, shall, within three months&nbsp; after his appointment, return&nbsp; to the&nbsp; court a true inventory&nbsp; of the real&nbsp; estate and&nbsp; all the&nbsp; gootls, chattels, rights and&nbsp; credits of&nbsp; the&nbsp; deceased which&nbsp; come into his possession or knowledge.&nbsp; (Ibid.,&nbsp; 668.)</p><blockquote><p>"An&nbsp; executor&nbsp; or administrator may commence,&nbsp; prosecute, or defend, in the right of the deceased, actions which survive to such executor or administrator,&nbsp; and are necessary&nbsp; for the&nbsp; recovery&nbsp; and protection of&nbsp; the property or rights of the&nbsp; deceased, and may prosecute or defend such actions or suits commenced in the lifetime of the deceased. (Ibid., 702.)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>"Actions to recover the title or possession of real estate, buildings, or any&nbsp; interest therein, actions to recover&nbsp; damages for an injury to person or property, real or personal, and actions to recover&nbsp; the&nbsp; possession of specific articles of personal property, shall survive, and may be commenced and prosecuted by or against the executor or administrator."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Ibid.,&nbsp; 703.)</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp; In&nbsp; conformity with&nbsp; these provisions and in accordance with&nbsp; general principles&nbsp; of&nbsp; law,&nbsp; the plaintiff Gavina Fernandez, as&nbsp; administratrix&nbsp; of&nbsp; the estate&nbsp; of Pedro Pena has&nbsp; been&nbsp; able to say&nbsp; justly in&nbsp; her complaint that the hereditary succession of this deceased is the owner and is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; entitled to ownership and possession of the property, which is withheld by the defendant, Eulogio Tria, in his capacity&nbsp; as administrator of the intestate estate of&nbsp; Francisca Pena, property the identity of which, according to the copy of the inventories made of said intestate estate, is set forth by the trial judge,&nbsp; against which statement and finding this Supreme Court finds no error to have been committed, and property which, as&nbsp; was properly asked in the&nbsp; complaint and&nbsp; as&nbsp; ordered in&nbsp; the&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; appealed from, should be in the possession and under the administration of the plaintiff.<br>&nbsp; <br>Once in possession, there should be applied the principle which this&nbsp; Supreme Court&nbsp; has laid down in interpreting the&nbsp; law:</p><p> 'By section 641, when a&nbsp; will is&nbsp; proved it is obligatory upon the court to appoint&nbsp; an executor&nbsp; or administrator. By&nbsp; virtue of&nbsp; other&nbsp; provisions of the code this&nbsp; executor or administrator has, under the direction of the court, the full&nbsp; administration and control of the deceased's property, real and personal,&nbsp; until&nbsp; a final decree is made in accordance with section&nbsp; 753.&nbsp; During the period&nbsp; of&nbsp; administration&nbsp; the heirs, devisees, and legatees have no&nbsp; right to interfere with&nbsp; the administrator or executor&nbsp; in the.discharge of his duties.&nbsp;&nbsp; They have&nbsp; no right,&nbsp; without his consent, to&nbsp; the possession of any part of the&nbsp; estate, real or personal.&nbsp; The&nbsp; theory of the present&nbsp; system&nbsp; is that the&nbsp; property&nbsp; is all <em>in the&nbsp; hands</em> of the court, and must stay there until the affairs&nbsp; of the&nbsp; deceased are&nbsp; adjusted and&nbsp; liquidated, and&nbsp; then the&nbsp; net balance&nbsp; is turned&nbsp; over to the persons by law&nbsp; entitled to it.&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; After the estate is fully settled,&nbsp; and all the debts and&nbsp; expenses of administration are paid, the law contemplates that there shall be&nbsp; a hearing&nbsp; or trial in this proceeding in the Court of First Instance for the purpose of determining&nbsp; who the parties are that are entitled to the&nbsp; estate in the&nbsp; hands of the executor or administrator for distribution, and after such hearing or trial it is made the duty of the&nbsp; court to enter a decree or final judgment, in which decree, according to section 753, the court 'shall assign the&nbsp; residue of the estate to the persons entitled to the same,&nbsp; and in its order the court shall&nbsp; name&nbsp; the&nbsp; persons&nbsp; and proportions or parts to&nbsp; which each&nbsp; is entitled/ "&nbsp; (Pimentel <em> vs.</em> Palanca, 5 Phil. Rep., 439, 440.)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; Until this&nbsp; time comes, therefore, it can not be determined which is the property or, which is the part thereof that belongs to the intestate estate of Francisca Pena, and until such time there is no property <em>belonging </em>to Francisca Pena or to Gavina Fernandez, but only&nbsp; property <em>belonging to</em> the intestate estate of Pedro Pena.<br>&nbsp; <br>To assert&nbsp; rights of&nbsp; ownership and&nbsp; possession in favor of Francisca Pena, before determining what the property is which may fall to her from the estate of Pedro Pena, seems to be a plain absurdity that does not require demonstration,&nbsp; just as there is no&nbsp; need for demonstrating that an effect can not precede its cause.&nbsp; Francisca&nbsp; Pena and Gavina Fernandez are the&nbsp; successors&nbsp; in interest&nbsp; of the estate of Pedro Pena, their predecessor in interest, and Francisca Pena can hardly have private property derived from Pedro&nbsp; Pena's estate before&nbsp; such estate&nbsp; has been divided and&nbsp; before Francisca Pena&nbsp; and Gavina Fernandez have been legally assigned their respective portions.</p><p> So the&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; appealed from&nbsp; could&nbsp; not&nbsp; be&nbsp; more in accordance with law,&nbsp; with strict justice&nbsp; and&nbsp; with the dictates of reason, and it is therefore hereby affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.</p><p><em>Torres, Mapa,</em> and<em> Carson, JJ</em>., concur.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br></p><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><p align="center"><em><br>DISSENTING: </em><br></p><p><br><strong>MORELAND, J., </strong><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>This&nbsp; is an action of ejectment begun by Gavina&nbsp; Fernandez, as administratrix of the estate of Pedro Pena, deceased,&nbsp; against Eulogio Tria,&nbsp; as&nbsp; administrator of the estate of&nbsp; Francisca Pena, deceased.</p><p> The land in suit is owned,&nbsp; according to the undisputed facts in&nbsp; this case, and as found&nbsp; by the decision of this court, as, follows:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Gavina&nbsp; Fernandez,&nbsp; personally, an undivided&nbsp; one-half interest.<br>&nbsp; <br>Eulogio Tria,&nbsp; personally,&nbsp; and his&nbsp; only child,&nbsp; Buenaventura, a minor, together own the other undivided&nbsp; one-half part, as heirs of Francisca&nbsp; Pefia, deceased, who,&nbsp; prior to her death, owned said undivided&nbsp; one-half part as tenant in&nbsp; common with said Gavina Fernandez.<br>&nbsp; <br>So that Gavina Fernandez, representing a half&nbsp; interest, and Eulogio Tria and his child, together representing the other half, are concededly owners and tenants in&nbsp; common of the land in suit in this&nbsp; case.</p><p> The land&nbsp; in question&nbsp; was&nbsp; originally&nbsp; owned&nbsp; by Pedro Pena, who concededly died in November, 1890.&nbsp; He left a will divising an undivided&nbsp; one-half&nbsp; of&nbsp; said&nbsp; land to his widow,&nbsp; Gavina Fernandez, and the&nbsp; other undivided&nbsp; one-half to his&nbsp; daughter,&nbsp; Francisca Pena.&nbsp; Francisca Pena, immediately&nbsp; on the death of her father,&nbsp; Pedro Pena,&nbsp; took possession of all&nbsp; of said&nbsp; lands and retained them till her death, which occurred on the 2d day&nbsp; of March,&nbsp; 1902. She left, her surviving, as her only heirs at law, her husband, Eulogio&nbsp; Tria,&nbsp; and an only child, a son, Buenaventura, born on the 14th day of July, 1899.&nbsp; These two&nbsp; heirs&nbsp; took possession&nbsp; of the property left&nbsp; by the wife and. mother and continue in the same at&nbsp; present.</p><p> During all the years from 1890 no one has ever questioned or challenged the ownership or the possession of&nbsp; Francisca or her successors in interest.</p><p> It will be noticed that&nbsp; the only apparent parties to this action are <em>administrators.&nbsp; Not one of the conceded owners of the land is a party. </em>&nbsp; Neither Gavina Fernandez,&nbsp; Eulogio Tria nor his&nbsp; minor son is a party.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>It will also be noticed that,&nbsp; although the&nbsp; complaint alleges that&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant administrator is in possession of the lands, that allegation&nbsp; is denied by the answer, and there is no legal proof in the evidence showing the possession alleged.&nbsp;&nbsp; The only witness who testified for the plaintiff on&nbsp; that subject was Emilio&nbsp; Fuentebella who said&nbsp; that he <em>supposed or concluded</em> that the&nbsp; possession was by&nbsp; Eulogio as adminstrator <em>simply because&nbsp; he was administrator</em>.&nbsp; On the contrary, all&nbsp; the&nbsp; facts&nbsp; and circumstances show that Eulogio&nbsp; Tria and his&nbsp; minor son&nbsp; are&nbsp; in&nbsp; possession of the lands in question as heirs and owners and have been since the death of the wife and&nbsp; mother in 1902.&nbsp; In fact, this court finds as a fact that the administration of the estate of Francisca by her husband,&nbsp; Eulogio,&nbsp; as&nbsp; administrator, <em>terminated in 1903</em>.&nbsp; The court says:</p><blockquote><p> "After the death of Francisca Pena, her widower Eulogio Tria made application, on&nbsp; January&nbsp; 13, 1903, for the appointment of a judicial administrator for the&nbsp; intestate estate of his late wife, and&nbsp; was himself appointed.&nbsp; He presented an inventory of&nbsp; the&nbsp; property of the deceased, which inventory&nbsp; included&nbsp; seven&nbsp; parcels&nbsp; of land.&nbsp; But commissioners of&nbsp; appraisal were&nbsp; appointed&nbsp; and appraised thirty-four parcels, and there the proceedings of that administration&nbsp; terminated."</p></blockquote><p>In view&nbsp; of this&nbsp; positive&nbsp; declaration&nbsp; I do not&nbsp; stop&nbsp; to discuss the character and effect of certain&nbsp; accounts introduced in evidence by the plaintiff.</p><p> The result is that, if the&nbsp; decision of this court&nbsp; amounts to anything in the end,&nbsp; it will&nbsp; terminate in the exclusion of Eulogio Tria and his son,&nbsp; Buenaventura, from the possession&nbsp; of the land in dispute.&nbsp; Moreover,&nbsp; if&nbsp; the defendant administrator is the representative of the&nbsp; heirs,&nbsp; then his expulsion from possession is equivalent, legally, to the expulsion of the heirsthemselves.&nbsp;&nbsp; I therefore treat the matter from the point of view of the heirs themselves,</p><p> Therefore, I dissent from this decision:&nbsp; </p><ol><li>&nbsp; Because it recognizes&nbsp; and&nbsp; approves the wisdom and policy as well&nbsp; as&nbsp; the&nbsp; validity of the&nbsp; appointment of an administrator with the&nbsp; will annexed <em>seventeen years after the death of&nbsp; the person for&nbsp; whose estate&nbsp; the administrator was appointed </em>(Pedro Pena having died in 1890), when, at the time&nbsp; of the appointment, there were&nbsp; no&nbsp; claims for or against the&nbsp; estate,&nbsp; when there&nbsp; was no&nbsp; personal property left by the deceased in&nbsp; existence,&nbsp; and when the real property left by the decedent had been continuously in the undisputed and unchallenged possession of his only child and devisee and her heirs for <em>seventeen</em> years.<br></li>&nbsp; <li>&nbsp; Because it sanctions and approves such appointment when, in my humble judgment, there was no legal or practical reason&nbsp; justifying such appointment.<br></li>&nbsp; <li>&nbsp; Because it sanctions such appointment upon a&nbsp; theory which, in my opinion,&nbsp; misconstrues the object and purpose of administration under the law of the Islands&nbsp; the&nbsp; theory of the court&nbsp; being that, when heirs or devisees differ over their respective rights in real estate, such real estate should. by means of&nbsp; the appointment of an administrator, be <em>taken away from all</em>.&nbsp; This ignores the rights of owners of lands to settle their disputes' between themselves or by appealing to the court&nbsp; in person.&nbsp; It is the forcible appointment of a guardian for every&nbsp; person who happens to be an heir and does not agree with his coheirs.<br></li>&nbsp; <li>&nbsp; Because 4 it lays&nbsp; down&nbsp; the proposition, and lays&nbsp; it down as the policy of the law of administration in this country, that one can&nbsp; do&nbsp; by indirection what he cannot do by direction.&nbsp; Gavina Fernandez&nbsp; being&nbsp; the&nbsp; owner of an undivided half of the real estate in question, and that is all she claims, and Eulogio and Buenaventura being the owners of the other undivided&nbsp; half, it is a principle unquestioned anywhere that Gavina could not dispossess them by any action or proceeding known to the law.&nbsp; One tenant in common cannot <em>legally&nbsp; dispossess</em> his&nbsp; fellow&nbsp; tenant in common.&nbsp; Their rights are equal, and equal rights cannot in law or justice produce unequal results.&nbsp;&nbsp; Both are entitled to possession, but not one alone.&nbsp; Not being able,&nbsp; then, to dispossess the defendants by direct attack, Gavina astutely takes the path of indirection.&nbsp; She procures the appointment of an administrator; and lo,&nbsp; a miracle is wrought, a right which&nbsp; never&nbsp; existed before&nbsp; was&nbsp; born, namely&nbsp; the&nbsp; right to drive from possession those whose rights in the premises from which they are expelled <em>are&nbsp; inferior&nbsp; to those&nbsp; of no man</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Prior&nbsp; to speaking the mysterious&nbsp; and portentous words which created the administration, all the powers of the estate&nbsp; could&nbsp; not have&nbsp; dispossessed them.&nbsp; There were no rights greater than theirs.&nbsp; There was no justice that they did not share.&nbsp; There was no one who could drive them from their home.&nbsp; In spite of all this, the administratrix passes her&nbsp; magic wand over this legal vacuum, this&nbsp; receptacle, this space in which there is nothing,&nbsp; and behold, it&nbsp; is peopled with powers.&nbsp; Where there was&nbsp; nothing before, there is something now.&nbsp;&nbsp; Where, before, there was nothing which could expel a person from land which he owned (and had&nbsp; possessed for seventeen years&nbsp; without&nbsp; challenge), now there is a strange creature of the law which, without ownership, dispossesses the owner,&nbsp; without right overcomes the rightful, and with nothing takes all.&nbsp; By the utterance of a single word, "appointed," the king becomes the beggar. Where direction&nbsp; is unsuccessful, the devious ways of indirection meet success.<br></li>&nbsp; <li>&nbsp; Because, while giving miraculous&nbsp; virtues to the appointment&nbsp; of an administrator in one case, it gives none whatever to such appointment in another.&nbsp; If the appointment of Gavina Fernandez as administratrix of the estate of Pedro Pena produces such miraculous results, why does not the appointment of&nbsp; Eulogio Tria&nbsp; as administrator&nbsp; of the estate of Francisca Pena produce results equally miraculous ? It is certain that Francisca Pena was just as much the owner of her real estate as Pedro Pena was of his; and therefore if the administrator&nbsp; of Pedro Pena can take his real estate away from everybody regardless of owners' rights, of law, equity, justice and everything else, why cannot the administrator of Francisca Pena do the same&nbsp; thing with the real estate which she left?&nbsp; If the administratrix of Pedro is an irresistible force as to the&nbsp; real&nbsp; property of Pedro, why is not the administrator of Francisca an irresistible force as to the real estate of Francisca?&nbsp;&nbsp; This court, as well as the court below,&nbsp; found the ownership of Francisca with the same force and effect as it found the ownership&nbsp; of Pedro. Why, then, should the administrator&nbsp; of Francisca give way to the&nbsp; administratrix of Pedro?&nbsp; If one can claim miraculous attributes, why cannot the other, and for&nbsp; the same reason?&nbsp; If one can succeed&nbsp; with&nbsp; nothing, why&nbsp; cannot the other?&nbsp; When two irresistible&nbsp; forces come together&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in opposition, the result is necessarily nil.&nbsp; If the administratrix of Pedro claims that she&nbsp; must take the real estate which&nbsp; he owned to&nbsp; administer&nbsp; it, the administrator&nbsp; of Francisca makes the same claim&nbsp; relative to the real estate which&nbsp; Francisca&nbsp; owned.&nbsp; If the administratrix of Pedro asserts that she must hold the real estate of Pedro during administration, so asserts the administrator of Francisca. Simply because Pedro Pena died first and Francisca's property came from him does not under the facts of this case give his administratrix superior powers over the administrator of Francisca.&nbsp; In reality there never was, in effect, an estate of Pedro&nbsp; Pena.&nbsp; The appointment seventeen years after&nbsp; his death was abortive.&nbsp;&nbsp; The estate, if one ever came into existence, ceased to exist&nbsp; on the distribution of the&nbsp; property. (Sections 596, 597, Code of Civil Procedure; McMicking <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Sy Conbieng, 21 Phil. Rep., 211.)&nbsp;&nbsp; The appointment in 1907 could not give life to something which,&nbsp; if it was ever born, died in 1890; nor can it destroy a status created by the division of the estate and a delivery of the property in 1890, which status obtained in 1907 when the futile&nbsp; appointment of plaintiff was made.<br></li>&nbsp; <li> Because it deprives the owners of their rights of property without any&nbsp; beneficial result whatever.&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the administratrix to do with this property?&nbsp; What can she do with it?&nbsp; Absolutely nothing.&nbsp; If&nbsp; it&nbsp; be said that the administratrix took it to divide between&nbsp; the devisees&nbsp; (a power attributed to an administrator which I deny, particularly relative to tenants in common, such proceedings being properly of partition under section 181 of&nbsp; the Code&nbsp; of&nbsp; Civil Procedure), <em>I reply that we do not knoxu&nbsp; that the devisees want to divide&nbsp; it</em>.&nbsp; There&nbsp; is not a particle&nbsp; of&nbsp; evidence in&nbsp; the record showing such a desire. <em>Indeed, the devisees are not even parties</em>.&nbsp; Surely the court will not divide real property among owners without their consent!&nbsp; If it be urged that the administratrix took it to ascertain who the owners are, I reply that the administratrix admits the ownership of Eulogio and Buenaventura.&nbsp; But, even&nbsp; if it be conceded that the administratrix took the property,&nbsp; and properly so, for the purposes mentioned,&nbsp; that does not in any sense or to any degree justify the dispossession of the owners.&nbsp;&nbsp; Both of those ends could be attained just as well by leaving them in possession while the questions were being determined.&nbsp; And being the unquestioned owners of an undivided one-half interest&nbsp; and having been in unchallenged possession for more than seventeen years, are they not entitled, under every principle of justice and&nbsp; equity,&nbsp; to remain in possession until superior rights are shown?&nbsp;&nbsp; I again put the question, Why should&nbsp; the administratrix take this property?&nbsp; The only possible answer is, "Just to give it back again after she has fattened her fees at the expense of&nbsp; rights which should never have been disturbed."&nbsp; It is the old refrain of marching up the hill and marching&nbsp; down again.<br></li>&nbsp; <li> Because so far as this&nbsp; action is concerned, it destroys the owners' rights in the property in question depriving them&nbsp; of legal&nbsp; virtue and effect and making them go for nought.&nbsp;&nbsp; Their admitted&nbsp; ownership of an undivided half, their undisturbed possession for seventeen years, are given no effect, are accorded no legal virtue and go for nothing. In spite of these conceded rights, this decision strips them as naked as the veriest squatter.&nbsp; While such deprivation of rights may be limited in time, it is nevertheless a deprivation.<br></li>&nbsp; <li> Because the only evidence&nbsp; presented in the case by the plaintiff to show the right&nbsp; which she asserts is the&nbsp; order appointing her administratrix.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no other evidence in the&nbsp; case&nbsp; on&nbsp; that subject.&nbsp;&nbsp; The only proof which the administratrix offers to sustain her alleged rights is her naked appointment.<br></li>&nbsp; <li> Because it lays down the doctrine, which I regard as a most unfortunate one, that the right of an administrator to the&nbsp; possession of the real estate of a decedent is <em>general and absolute</em> and not special and relative; and this&nbsp; court by this decision now and for the future drives absolute and conceded owners from the possession&nbsp; of their lands <em>on the mere proof of&nbsp; the appointment of an administrator,</em> without showing the&nbsp; existence of the special conditions&nbsp; upon which, in my judgment, the&nbsp; rights of an administrator in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; real estate depend.&nbsp; This doctrine, enunciated so generally in this case, and,no other interpretation can be given to the decision, is not founded in the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure&nbsp; and is&nbsp; not&nbsp; supported, so far as I can ascertain,&nbsp; by a single Anglo-Saxon authority.<br></li>&nbsp; <li>Because it makes the administrator the representative of one heir as against another, thereby seriously misapprehending the&nbsp; nature&nbsp; and&nbsp; purpose of administration and&nbsp; the functions of&nbsp; an&nbsp; administrator.<br></li>&nbsp; <li>Because the decision holds that before anyone has any title or right to property whatever&nbsp; under the law of these Islands it must go to the administrator and be administered by him, and then passed through the court in the proceedings for division; <em>that&nbsp; before property belongs to an heir or devisee and before he has any right to it whatever, </em>it must go through the weary and expensive length of administration; that, although his ownership is admitted by&nbsp; everybody, and&nbsp; although&nbsp; there&nbsp; are no claims&nbsp; for&nbsp; or against the estate and no reason exists&nbsp; why an administrator should be appointed, yet the property is, nevertheless, taken&nbsp; from him, he is dispossessed of the use and occupation thereof, it&nbsp; is placed in a useless administration, and it is&nbsp; returned to him,&nbsp; after&nbsp; perhaps years, reduced&nbsp; by useless expense and the fees of the administrator.&nbsp; During all this time the administrator is promoting litigation.&nbsp; If the heir in possession believes that, in justice, he&nbsp; ought not to be driven out except&nbsp; by&nbsp; superior rights, and accordingly refuses to vacate, there must be a suit to put him out. Then there must be another to determine whether he is the son of his father or not and whether his father and mother were&nbsp; married.&nbsp; There&nbsp; must&nbsp; be still&nbsp; another&nbsp; hearing&nbsp; to ascertain what his share in the property&nbsp; is.&nbsp;&nbsp; And all this, although every one of these facts thus determined may&nbsp; be and generally is admitted by everybody.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this very case no one questions the rights of&nbsp; Eulogio and his son.&nbsp; Yet out they go.&nbsp;&nbsp; The court says:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; "Until this time comes (until an administrator has been appointed,&nbsp; the property taken away from the real owners, placed in court, the&nbsp; heirs and their shares determined, and final order made for distribution), therefore, it cannot be determined which is the property or which the part thereof that belongs to the intestate estate of Francisca Pena, and until such time there is no property <em>belonging </em>to Francisca Pena or to Gavina Fernandez, but only property <em>belonging</em> to the intestate estate of Pedro Pena.</li></ol><blockquote><p> "To assert rights of ownership and possession in favor of Francisca Pena before determining what the property, is which <em>may</em> fall to her from the estate&nbsp; of Pedro&nbsp; Pena seems to be a plain absurdity that does not require demonstration, just as there is no need for demonstrating that an effect cannot precede its&nbsp; cause.&nbsp; Francisca&nbsp; Pena&nbsp; and Gavina Fernandez&nbsp; are&nbsp; the successors in interest of the estate of Pedro Pena, their predecessor&nbsp; in interest,&nbsp; and Francisca Pena can hardly have private&nbsp; property derived&nbsp; from Pedro&nbsp; Pena's&nbsp; estate before such estate has been divided and before Francisca Pena and Gavina Fernandez have been legally assigned their respective portions."</p></blockquote><p> The&nbsp; opinion also&nbsp; says:</p><blockquote><p>"In conformity&nbsp; with these provisions&nbsp; and in accordance with general principles of law, the plaintiff, Gavina&nbsp; Fernandez, as administratrix of the estate of Pedro Pena, has been able to say justly in her complaint that the hereditary succession of this deceased is the owner and is entitled to ownership and possession&nbsp; of the property,&nbsp; which&nbsp; is withheld by the defendant, Eulogio&nbsp; Tria.&nbsp; *&nbsp; * *."</p></blockquote><p> I regard the&nbsp; doctrine laid&nbsp; down&nbsp; in these quotations to be&nbsp; contrary to&nbsp; the&nbsp; proposition as already established&nbsp; by this court in several decisions.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am of the opinion also that it is&nbsp; contrary to the&nbsp; provisions of the&nbsp; Civil Code and the decisions of&nbsp; the&nbsp; supreme court of Spain.&nbsp; Articles 657, 658 and 661 of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Civil&nbsp; Code read as follows:</p><blockquote><p> "The rights to the succession of a person are transmitted from the&nbsp; moment of his&nbsp; death.</p><p> "Succession is granted&nbsp; either by the will of the man as expressed in a will or, in&nbsp; its absence,&nbsp; by provision of law.</p><p> "The first is called testamentary the second legal succession.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;"It may also be bestowed partly by will of man and partly by provision of&nbsp; law.</p><p> "Heirs succeed the deceased in all&nbsp; his rights, and obligations&nbsp; by the mere fact of his death."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; In a decision of the supreme court of Spain dated November 23, 1903, the court said:<br>&nbsp; <br>"As has&nbsp; been&nbsp; repeatedly decided by this supreme court, the heir, as the&nbsp; successor of the deceased in&nbsp; all his rights and,obligations, has&nbsp; the&nbsp; power&nbsp; and&nbsp; the.right&nbsp; to&nbsp; demand what&nbsp; pertains to his interest, without reference to his co-heirs, whenever it is not to their prejudice and&nbsp; provided that he conforms to the laws regulating community of property."</p></blockquote><p> In another decision dated December 11 of the same year the court said:</p><blockquote><p> "It is an ancient rule of our law, confirmed by article 661 of the Civil Code, that the heirs succeed by the mere fact of the death of&nbsp; their predecessor in&nbsp; interest."</p></blockquote><p> In&nbsp; the case of Pascual <em>vs.</em>&nbsp; Angeles (4 Phil.&nbsp; Rep., 604) the court said: </p><blockquote><p>"If the juridical personality of the deceased&nbsp; testatrix is transmitted to the heir and the latter&nbsp; is considered as identified with his devisor, to whose rights, actions,&nbsp; and obligations,&nbsp; not&nbsp; extinguished by&nbsp; her death,&nbsp; he succeeded,&nbsp; then there is no doubt that the plaintiff, as testamentary successor of his deceased sister Ciriaca, as&nbsp; appears&nbsp; from the will on page 17 of the&nbsp; bill of exceptions, had a right to.oust the defendant,&nbsp; Angeles,&nbsp; for failure to pay the stipulated rent. (Art. 659 of the Civil Code; judgments of the supreme court of Spain of February 10, 1879; September 13, 1882; and January 28, 1892.)"</p></blockquote><p> In the case of Ilustre, as administrator, <em>vs</em>. Frondosa (17 Phil.&nbsp; Rep., 321), this court said:</p><blockquote><p>"Under the provisions of the Civil&nbsp; Code (arts. 657-661), the rights&nbsp; to the succession of&nbsp; a person are transmitted from&nbsp; the moment of his&nbsp; death; in other words, the heirs succeeded immediately to all of the property of the deceased ancestor.&nbsp;&nbsp; The property belongs to the heirs at the moment of the death of the ancestor as completely as if the ancestor had executed&nbsp; and delivered to them a deed for the same before his&nbsp; death.&nbsp; In the absence of debts existing against the estate, the heirs may enter upon the&nbsp; administration of the said property immediately.&nbsp; If they desire to administer it jointly,&nbsp; they&nbsp; may do&nbsp; so.&nbsp; If they desire&nbsp; to partition&nbsp; it among themselves&nbsp; and can do this&nbsp; by mutual&nbsp; agreement, they also have that privilege.&nbsp; The Code of Procedure in Civil Actions&nbsp; provides how&nbsp; an estate may&nbsp; be&nbsp; divided&nbsp; by a petition for&nbsp; partition in case they can not mutually agree in the division.&nbsp;&nbsp; When there are no debts existing against the estate, there is certainly no occasion for the intervention of an administrator in the settlement and partition of the estate among&nbsp; the heirs.&nbsp; When&nbsp; the&nbsp; heirs are all&nbsp; of lawful age and there are no debts, there is no reason why the estate should&nbsp; be burdened with the costs and expenses of an&nbsp; administrator.&nbsp; The&nbsp; property belonging absolutely to the heirs, in the absence of existing debts against the estate, the administrator has no&nbsp; right&nbsp; to intervene in any way whatever&nbsp; in the division of the&nbsp; estate among the&nbsp; heirs. *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; If there are any heirs of the estate who have not received&nbsp; their participation,&nbsp; they have&nbsp; their remedy&nbsp; by petition for partition of&nbsp; the said estate."</p></blockquote><p> In the case&nbsp; of Malahacan, as administrator, <em>vs</em>.&nbsp; Ignacio and others (19&nbsp; Phil. Rep., 434), this&nbsp; court&nbsp; cited with approval the case just quoted from and said:</p><blockquote><p>"The action is brought by Simon Malahacan as administrator of the goods, chattels, and credits of Guillerma Martinez, deceased,&nbsp; against the&nbsp; defendants, the&nbsp; only&nbsp; heirs&nbsp; at law of the said&nbsp; deceased, to recover possession of the real estate of which the said Guillerma Martinez died&nbsp; seized, which said real estate the defendants had been occupying for some years&nbsp; before the&nbsp; commencement of this action.</p><p> "Under the&nbsp; provisions of the Civil Code the&nbsp; ownership of real estate passes to the heirs of the owner instantly on his death.&nbsp; Guillerma&nbsp; Martinez, having died seized of&nbsp; the lands&nbsp; involved&nbsp; in this suit,&nbsp; leaving the&nbsp; defendants&nbsp; as her&nbsp; only heirs at law, it follows that said&nbsp; heirs instantly became the&nbsp; owners&nbsp; and were entitled to&nbsp; the&nbsp; immediate possession thereof.&nbsp; It is not alleged&nbsp; in the complaint nor does it appear from the record or the evidence in this case that there were debts outstanding against Guillerma Martinez at the time of her death.&nbsp;&nbsp; The only ground upon which an administrator&nbsp; can demand of the heirs&nbsp; at law possession of the real&nbsp; estate of which his&nbsp; intestate&nbsp; died seized is that such land will be required to be sold to pay the debts of the deceased."</p></blockquote><p> To the same effect is the case of&nbsp; Irlanda vs. Pitargue (22 Phil. Rep., 383).</p><p> In the case of McMicking <em>vs.</em> Sy Conbieng&nbsp; (21 Phil. Rep., 211), this&nbsp; court held:</p><blockquote><p>"It is the undisputed policy of every people which maintains the&nbsp; principle of private&nbsp; ownership of property that he who owns property shall&nbsp; not be deprived&nbsp; of its&nbsp; immediate possession and use except for urgent and imperative&nbsp; reasons; and then only so long and to such extent as is necessary to make the&nbsp; opposing rights&nbsp; which&nbsp; underlie those reasons effective.&nbsp; This being so, said sections, which have for their object the prompt possession and use of property by the&nbsp; persons who&nbsp; really own it, should&nbsp; be given liberal construction.&nbsp;&nbsp; They&nbsp; should&nbsp; not&nbsp; be&nbsp; unreasonably straitened or narrowed in&nbsp; their extent, but, rather, should be given that wideness and fullness of application without which they cannot produce their most beneficial effects."</p></blockquote><p> In relation to sections 596 and 597 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the court&nbsp; held in&nbsp; said case:</p><blockquote><p> "The purpose of these sections being, also, to avoid the trouble, loss of time,&nbsp; expense, and other undesirable&nbsp; concomitants of administration,&nbsp; such construction&nbsp; should&nbsp; be given as will&nbsp; best conserve this purpose."</p></blockquote><ol start="12"><li>&nbsp; Because&nbsp; the'&nbsp; administrator&nbsp; against&nbsp;&nbsp; whom it&nbsp; is rendered was not in possession of the land in dispute when the judgment was rendered and&nbsp; has never been&nbsp; in possession.&nbsp; On the contrary it is the inevitable conclusion from the whole case that Eulogio Tria and his minor son are in possession as heirs of Francisca Pena and have been without dispute&nbsp; or challenge since 1902.<br></li>&nbsp; <li>&nbsp; Because the court found as a fact in another part of the same decision that the&nbsp; administration proceedings&nbsp; on the estate of Francisca Pena, wife of Eulogio, terminated in 1903.&nbsp;&nbsp; This being so, the administrator of that estate could&nbsp; not have&nbsp; been&nbsp; in&nbsp; possession when&nbsp; this action was commenced, and cannot be now.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore the basic allegation in ejectment, viz, the&nbsp; possession of the&nbsp; defendant, is unproved in this case.<br></li>&nbsp; <li>&nbsp; Because the actual owners of the land in suit, two of whom were also in actual&nbsp; possession when this action was commenced and are now in possession, are not parties in&nbsp; this action.&nbsp; Not&nbsp; one of the actual&nbsp; owners is a party to&nbsp; this suit although&nbsp; two of them&nbsp; and&nbsp; their&nbsp; predecessors in interest have been continuously in possession since 1890.<br></li>&nbsp; <li>&nbsp; Because no steps were taken by&nbsp; the court below&nbsp; or by this court to&nbsp; protect the interests of a&nbsp; minor in actual possession of the real estate in litigation in this suit.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; rendered&nbsp; by this&nbsp; court&nbsp; in this case&nbsp; is not fruitless,&nbsp; it will&nbsp; dispossess&nbsp; Eulogio and his minor&nbsp; son by excluding Eulogio as administrator,&nbsp; the court having found that he is in partial possession as&nbsp; such.&nbsp; It is undoubted that the court below will, on the judgment of this court,&nbsp; at once order the plaintiff put in possession to the exclusion&nbsp; of everybody else.&nbsp; This will dispossess&nbsp; the minor&nbsp; son with his father, when it is indisputable&nbsp; that&nbsp; they&nbsp; together are the real possessors and not the administrator.&nbsp; Under such conditions the&nbsp; court should&nbsp; take measures to. protect the minor. <br></li>&nbsp; <li> Because&nbsp; the evidence&nbsp; produced&nbsp; by the plaintiff&nbsp; is <em>legally worthless</em> for any&nbsp; purpose except to strengthen the defendants' case&nbsp; and the decision has,&nbsp; therefore, nothing to sustain it.&nbsp; The possession of the father and son&nbsp; is <em>not</em> illegal&nbsp; or&nbsp; unlawful.&nbsp; It is not subordinate&nbsp; to&nbsp; anyone else. Their rights are not inferior&nbsp; to those of any other person, especially the&nbsp; plaintiff.&nbsp; No&nbsp; one in&nbsp; the world,&nbsp; so&nbsp; far&nbsp; as this&nbsp; record&nbsp; shows, has higher or more perfect legal&nbsp; rights than they.</li></ol></div>
