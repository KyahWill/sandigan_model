				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On the 3d day of November, 1910, the plaintiff commenced an action against 
the defendants in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Ambos 
Camarines, for the purpose of recovering the sum of P100,000 as damages 
resulting from an alleged libelous publication.
<p>The complaint alleged that the plaintiff was a citizen of the municipality of 
Nueva Caceres, Province of Ambos Camarines, and was, at the time of the 
commencement of the action, governor of said province.</p>
<p>The complaint alleged that the defendants were the proprietors, 
<em>directores, redactores, editores, administradores,</em> and <em>socios 
</em>of a <em>bisemanal</em> newspaper called "El Camarinense" which newspaper 
was published in the Spanish and Bicol languages and circulated in the Province 
of Nueva Caceres, in Manila, and in almost all provinces and municipalities. The 
complaint set out in full extracts from said newspaper published on several 
dates. The first on the 9th of June, 1910, was entitled "El Rabudo Affair." The 
second was published on the 14th of July, 1910, and was entitled "Balance 
Semestral." The third was published on the 4th of August, 1910, entitled 
"Consumatum Est." The fourth was published on the 4th of August and was entitled 
"Gobierno de Parientes</p>
<p>The complaint also contained further allegations relating to the alleged 
libelous publications in said newspaper on the 20th and 28d days of October, 
1910.</p>
<p>The defendants, Fulgencio Contreras and Julian Ocampo, each answering for 
himself, filed a general and special denial. The special denial admitted said 
publications and alleged that they were true and were published in good faith, 
with good intentions and with justifiable ends and in compliance with their 
legal, moral, and social duty. They also alleged that said publications were 
privileged.</p>
<p>The defendants Mariano de la Rosa, Vicente Rodriguez, Frank Silva-Netto, Juan 
San Buenaventura, Hugo Camps, and Leon Reyes, each answering for himself, 
alleged that they had not written or published, neither had they participated in 
said publication of the said alleged libelous articles contained in the 
complaint.</p>
<p>Upon the issues thus presented the cause was brought on for trial. After 
hearing the evidence, the Honorable Percy M. Moir, judge, rendered a decision on 
the 12th day of February, 1918. The decision contains all of the material 
allegations of the complaint, together with a very careful analysis of the proof 
adduced during the trial of the cause. The lower court found that the evidence 
against the said Mariano de la Rosa, Vicente Rodriguez, Frank Silva-Netto, Juan 
San Buenaventura, Hugo Camps, and Leon Reyes was not sufficient to support the 
facts alleged in the complaint and therefore absolved said defendants from any 
liability under the complaint. The lower court found from the evidence adduced 
during the trial of the cause that the defendants Fulgencio Contreras and Julian 
Ocampo were responsible for the publication of the alleged libelous matters and 
sentenced them jointly and severally to pay to the plaintiff the sum of P12,000, 
as damages done to his reputation and fame, as well as the sum of P3,000 as 
punitive damages, and to pay the costs.</p>
<p>From that sentence the defendants Fulgencio Contreras and Julian Ocampo 
appealed to this court and made the following assignments of error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"1. The court erred in denying the motion of the defendants, Fulgencio 
Contreras and Julian Ocampo, in which they prayed that he should not sit in this 
case because the said court had sentenced the said defendants in the two 
criminal actions for libel which were brought against them by reason of the same 
writings and articles upon which the plaintiff bases his right of action in the 
present cause, and because the trial court had already formed an opinion adverse 
to the defendants in this case.</p>
<p>"2. The court erred in deciding that the articles complained of as libelous 
are so in themselves and because this honorable Supreme Court had already 
decided that they were.</p>
<p>"3. The court erred in failing to make a finding of the facts upon which he 
based his belief and decision that the said articles are libelous.</p>
<p>"4. The court erred in deciding that the only question he had to decide was 
that relating to the damage and prejudice occasioned to the plaintiff as related 
in his complaint.</p>
<p>"5. The court erred in deciding that the damages occasioned to the 
plaintiff's reputation, fame and feelings could be estimated, as he did estimate 
them, at P12,000 Philippine currency.</p>
<p>"6. The court erred in sentencing the defendants to pay punitive damages and 
in estimating these latter at P3,000 Philippine currency.</p>
<p>"7. The court erred in sentencing the defendants, Fulgencio Contreras and 
Julian Ocampo, jointly and severally to pay to the plaintiff P15,000 Philippine 
currency, and costs."</p></blockquote>
<p>With reference to the first assignment of error, we find that the error 
assigned therein was merely a challenge to the qualification of the judge to try 
the cause. Upon the question of disqualification of judges, we find that section 
8 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions provides when a judge may be 
disqualified. Such disqualification seems to be as follows:</p>
<p>First. When the judge is pecuniarily interested.</p>
<p>Second. When the judge is related to either of the parties within the sixth 
degree of consanguinity or affinity, computed according to the rules of Civil 
Law.</p>
<p>Third. When he has been counsel for the parties.</p>
<p>Fourth. Where he had presided in the inferior court and where his rulings or 
decisions are the subject of review.</p>
<p>Said section 8 further provides that these disqualifications may be waived by 
the written consent of all the parties in interest, when such written consent is 
signed by the respective parties and entered upon the record.</p>
<p>Said section 8 further provides that no challenge as to the competency of any 
official named shall be received <em>or allowed,</em> but if it be claimed that 
the official is disqualified by the provisions of said section, the party 
objecting to his competency may, in writing, file with the official his 
objection, stating the grounds therefor, and the official shall thereupon 
proceed with the trial or withdraw therefrom, in accordance with his 
determination of the question of his disqualification. His decision shall be 
made in writing and filed with the other papers in the case, but <em>no appeal 
or stay of action</em> shall be allowed from or by reason of his decision in 
favor of his own competency, until after final judgment in his court.</p>
<p>From an examination of the objection made by the attorneys to the 
qualification of the judge in the present case, it may be noted that the 
objection is not based upon any of the grounds of disqualification stated in 
said section. The basis of the alleged disqualification was simply that the 
judge had theretofore tried the same defendants for the crime of libel and that 
the present action for civil damages was based upon the same alleged libel. The 
record shows that the lower court made repeated efforts to secure some other 
judge to try the case. Upon his failure, however, to secure another judge, he 
proceeded with the trial. There being nothing in law which prohibited him from 
proceeding with the trial of the cause, we are of the opinion that he committed 
no error in so doing. (Jurado &amp; Co. <em>vs.</em> Hongkong &amp; Shanghai 
Banking Corporation, 1 Phil. Rep., 395; U. S. <em>vs. </em>Sy Maco, 17 Phil. 
Rep., 565.) Considering the fact that he was not disqualified, by virtue of the 
provisions of said section 8, from trying the cause, it was his duty to go 
forward with the trial. (Joaquin <em>vs.</em> Barretto, 25 Phil. Rep., 281.) It 
being, therefore, his legal duty to proceed with the trial, a reversal of the 
judgment upon the ground that he did proceed, would be unwarranted. The question 
whether or not the result of the first trial created a prejudice in the mind of 
the court which resulted in his failure to properly appreciate the weight of the 
evidence adduced during the trial of the present cause, will be considered when 
we come to examine the sufficiency of the evidence adduced. We find no reason 
for reversing or modifying the sentence of the lower court based upon the first 
assignment of error.</p>
<p>With reference to the second assignment of error, to wit, that the evidence 
did not show that the defendants were guilty of the crime of libel, it will be 
noted that during the trial of the present cause (R. G. No. 8894), by agreement, 
the proof which had theretofore been presented in causes Nos. 7897<span class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> and 7898<span class="style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span> was presented in the present cause. Therefore 
the only proof which we have before us upon the question whether or not the 
defendants were guilty of the crime of libel is the proof which had been 
theretofore presented in said criminal cases. Upon a consideration of the proof 
in said other cases, the lower court found that the facts showed, beyond a 
reasonable doubt, that the defendants were guilty of the crime of libel. From 
that decision the defendants appealed to this court, and this court, upon a full 
consideration of such proof, also found that the said facts constituted the 
crime of libel. Upon a reexamination of the same proof adduced during the trial 
of the present cause, we find no reason for modifying our conclusions heretofore 
given in said causes Nos. 7897 and 7898. We find no reason for reversing or 
modifying the decision of the lower court based upon the second assignment of 
error.</p>
<p>With reference to the third assignment of error, to wit, that the lower court 
failed to make a finding of facts in his decision, we find, upon an examination 
of said decision, that it contains a very full and complete analysis of the 
facts adduced during the trial of the cause. The lower court set out in full the 
publications constituting the crime of libel, and showed in detail how said 
publications were libelous. We find no reason for modifying the decision of the 
lower court based upon the third assignment of error.</p>
<p>With reference to the fourth assignment of error, in view of the fact that 
the action was brought for damages resulting from an alleged libel, that being 
the only purpose of the action, it is difficult to see how the lower court 
committed an error in his decision when he said that the only question which he 
had to resolve in the action was that relating to the damage and prejudice 
occasioned to the plaintiff. There is nothing in the fourth assignment of error 
which makes it necessary to modify the decision of the lower court.</p>
<p>With reference to the fifth assignment of error, it may be said that the 
amount of damage done to the reputation, fame, and feelings of a person libeled 
is one of the most difficult questions which the courts have to decide, for the 
reason that there is seldom ever any tangible evidence by which such damage can 
be accurately and mathematically measured or estimated. Courts must take into 
consideration the standing and reputation of the person libeled in the community 
in which he lives, together with many other circumstances and relations, which 
are almost impossible of definition. The damage resulting can not be 
mathematically ascertained. Courts must do the best they can in an effort to be 
just to all the parties. The damage resulting from the libeling of a man living 
in a sparsely settled community, with no political or social relations, even 
though he might be equally aggrieved, would not be equal to the damage suffered 
under the same kind of a libel by one living in a thickly settled community, 
with a high standing socially and politically. In either case, however, the 
exact amount of damage suffered can not be accurately computed. The amount which 
the courts must fix in such a case, after having reached the conclusion that the 
publication was libelous, is largely dependent upon the opinion and discretion 
of the court. It is not difficult to realize, however, that the damage done to 
one's reputation and feelings by a libel such as the present, is great and 
almost immeasurable. The specific amount of damages, however, to be awarded must 
depend upon the facts in each case, and the sound discretion of the court. No 
fixed or precise rules can be laid down covering the amount of damages in such 
cases. It is difficult to include all of the facts and conditions which enter 
into the measure of such damages. The difficulty, however, in arriving at the 
actual damages occasioned by a libel to a man's reputation and fame, does not 
disentitle him to have an attempt made to assess such damages. (Wakeman<em> vs. 
</em>Wheeler, etc., Co., 101 N. Y., 205; Beeman <em>vs</em>. Banta, 118 N. Y., 
538; Swain <em>vs.</em> Schieffelin, 134 N. Y., 471; U. S. <em>vs.</em> Beham, 
110 U. S., 338; Howard <em>vs.</em> Stillwell &amp; B. Manufacturing Co., 139 U. 
S., 199.)</p>
<p>A man's good name and reputation are worth more to him than all the wealth 
which he can accumulate during a lifetime of industrious labor. To have that 
destroyed may be eminently of more damage to him personally than the destruction 
of his physical wealth or health. He may prize his good name more than even his 
physical wealth or his health. The loss is immeasurable. No amount of money can 
compensate him for his loss. (Worcester vs. Ocampo, 22 Phil. Rep., 42.) The 
enjoyment of a private reputation is as much a constitutional right as the 
possession of life, liberty, or property. It is one of those rights necessary to 
human society and underlies the whole scheme of civilization and stable 
government. The respect and esteem of a man's neighbors are among the highest 
rewards of a well spent life vouchsafed to man in this existence. The hope of 
the good esteem of one's neighbors and associates is the inspiration of youth 
and its possession is a solace in later years. A man of affairs who has been 
seen and known by his fellow men in the active pursuits of life for many years 
and who has developed a great character and an unblemished reputation, has 
acquired a possession more useful and more valuable to most men than the 
possession of lands or houses or silver or gold. The law recognizes the value of 
such a reputation and imposes upon him who attacks it by slanderous words or 
libelous publication, the liability to make full compensation for the damage 
done.</p>
<p>In the present case the defendants in their answer alleged that the 
publications alleged to be libelous were true. The proof, however, adduced 
during the trial of the cause, failed to sustain that allegation. In many of the 
States of the Union the courts have held that in an action for libel where the 
defendant attempts to prove the truthfulness of the libelous allegations and 
fails, that the allegation is a repetition of the libel and justifies the courts 
in increasing the damages resulting from the original libel. The effect of such 
allegation in the answer and the failure to sustain the same as affecting the 
damages, however, is not raised in the present case.</p>
<p>The lower court sentenced the defendants to pay to the plaintiff the sum of 
P12,000, as the amount of damage done to his good name and reputation. After a 
careful examination of the evidence brought to this court, we are of the opinion 
that the judgment of the lower court imposed upon the defendants, jointly and 
severally to pay to the plaintiff the sum of P12,000 and the costs, should be 
modified and that a judgment should be entered against the defendants, jointly 
and severally, to pay to the plaintiff the sum of P2,000.</p>
<p>With reference to the sixth assignment of error, the appellants allege, in 
effect, that the lower court committed an error in rendering a judgment against 
them, jointly and severally, for the sum of P3,000 as punitive damages. The 
right of the courts to impose punitive damages is expressly recognized by the 
Libel Law (Act No. 277). The courts have the same difficulty in arriving at the 
exact amount of the punishment which should be imposed as punitive damages, 
which they have in arriving at the exact amount of damages done to reputation, 
etc. Considering the fact that each of the defendants has heretofore been 
sentenced to pay a fine of P1,000 as a result of the criminal action for the 
same libel, and considering that sentence as a part of the punishment, we are of 
the opinion that the sentence in the present case, imposing upon them the 
obligation to pay P3,000, should be modified and that a judgment should be 
entered against each of them, jointly and severally, to pay to the plaintiff the 
sum of P 500 and the costs.</p>
<p>With reference to the seventh assignment of error, we find no reason for 
modifying or reversing the judgment of the lower court for the reason that the 
judgment imposed by him was imposed upon the defendants jointly and severally. 
They each are guilty of the acts which caused the damages to the plaintiff. The 
record shows that they acted together. They are joint tort feasors. The record 
fails to show that one was less culpable than the other. Joint tort feasors are 
jointly and severally liable for the tort which they commit. The person injured 
may sue all of them, or any number less than all. Each is liable for the whole 
damage caused by all, and all together are liable for the whole damage. Joint 
tort feasois are not liable <em>pro rata.</em> The damages can not be 
apportioned among them, by the courts. The apportionment can only be made by 
themselves, among themselves. They can not insist upon an apportionment, for the 
purpose of each paying an aliquot part. They are jointly and severally liable 
for the whole amount. (Forebrother <em>vs.</em> Ansley, 1 Campbell (Eng.), 343; 
Pitcher<em> vs.</em> Bailey, 8 East, 171; Booth <em>vs.</em> Hodgson, 6 Term 
Reps., 405; Vose <em>vs.</em> Grant, 15 Mass., 505; Acheson <em>vs.</em> Miller, 
18 Ohio, 1; Wallace<em> vs</em>. Miller, 15 La. Ann., 449; Murphy <em>vs.</em> 
Wilson, 44 Mo., 313; Bishop <em>vs.</em> Ely, 9 Johnson (N. Y.), 294 , Pardridge 
<em>vs.</em> Brady, 7 111. App., 639; Carney <em>vs.</em> Read, 11 Ind., 417; 
Lee <em>vs.</em> Black, 27 Ark., 337; Bevins <em>vs.</em> Mc- Elroy, 52 Am. Dec, 
258; Worcester <em>vs.</em> Ocampo, 22 Phil. Rep., 42.) </p>
<p>For the foregoing reasons and with the modifications above indicated, the 
judgment of the lower court is hereby affirmed, with costs. </p>
