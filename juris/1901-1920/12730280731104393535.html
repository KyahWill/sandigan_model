				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On May 19, 1915, action was begun in the Court of First Instance of Tayabas 
to recover the sum of P5,202 claimed to be due under a written document set out 
in the complaint, with interest. On July 17, 1915, the defendant answered 
alleging deceit and setting up a special defense, but not specifically denying 
under oath the genuineness and due execution of the instrument. After various 
delays, the cause was assigned for trial on January 22, 1917. On January 18, 
1917, the defendant presented a motion asking for the transference of the 
hearing to the month of February because of his grave illness; in corroboration 
of this fact, there was made a part of the motion, Exhibit A, the certificate of 
Dr. Domingo Antonio, <em>Midico-Cirujano</em>, reading as follows:
<p align="right">"January 17, 1917.</p>
<p>"I certify that I am rendering medical services to Mr. Bernardo Marquez for 
amoebic dysentery, and that he has to stay in bed for at least two weeks in 
order to be completely cured; and I issue this certificate for such purposes as 
it may serve.</p>
<p align="right">(Sgd.) "D. Antonio."</p>
<p>On the day set for the hearing of the cause, the Honoable Jose C. Abreu, 
judge of first instance, denied the motion for postponement because "en frente 
de su alegacion y el certificado medico con que se trata de corroborarla que no 
estan jurados, existe la afirmacion bajo juramento de la demandante de que en el 
dia de ayer estuvo a visitar al demandado en su casa y le encontro en 
circunstancias tales que no hay motivo para presumir que estaba guardando cama 
para no poder venir a este Juzgado," (as against his allegation and the medical 
certificate with which he endeavors to corroborate it, neither of them being 
sworn to, we have the plaintifFs statement, made under oath, that yesterday she 
visited the defendant in his house and found him in such condition as to leave 
no room to presume that he was sick and was therefore unable to come to this 
court). In other words, the court declined to postpone or adjourn the cause 
under the power granted by sections 130 and 131 of the Code of Civil Procedure. 
On the same date or, to use the words of the appellant, immediately after 
resolution of the motion, the court proceeded to hear the plaintiff and his 
witnesses, and to render judgment. This judgment condemned the defendant to pay 
to the plaintiff the sum of P5,202, with legal interest from May 19, 1915, and 
the costs. On January 29, 1917, defendant excepted to the judgment and moved for 
a new trial. In this motion for a new trial, there was included, Exhibit A, the 
sworn statement of Dr. Domingo Antonio, and Exhibit B, the sworn statement of 
Dr. Antonio Vasquez, <em>Medico-Cirujano</em>, the latter reading as 
follows:</p>
<p>"I, Antonio Vasquez, after being duly sworn, do hereby declare:</p>
<p>"1. That I am a physician and surgeon, residing in the city of Manila, 
Philippine Islands.</p>
<p>"2. That I am acquainted with Mr. Bernardo Marquez.</p>
<p>"3. That I had rendered medical services to the said Bernardo Marquez from 
the 20th to the 27th, inclusive, of January, 1917, on account of his having 
gastrontestinal troubles; and that I recommended to Mr. Marquez to stay in bed 
during the said period of time.</p>
<p>"Manila, January 29, 1917.</p>
<p align="right">(Sgd.) "A. Vasquez."</p>
<p>The plaintiff through her attorney opposed the granting of the motion of the 
defendant. The trial court denied the motion for a new trial. Having received 
notice of this order of the court, the defendant duly excepted thereto, and 
through Attorney Pascual B. Azanza gave notice of his desire to prosecute a bill 
of exceptions to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Appellant makes three assignments of error all of which simmer down to a 
resolution of the question of whether or not the trial judge abused his 
discretion in insisting on the cause coming to trial on the date assigned, and 
in later denying the motion for a new trial.</p>
<p>To corroborate his argument, counsel for appellant quotes from Volume 9, Cyc, 
page 96, as follows:</p>
<p>"The illness of a party is not <em>ipso facto</em> a cause for continuance of 
the cause; but where a party's presence at the trial is indispensable and the 
character of his illness is such as to render his presence at the trial 
impossible a continuance should be granted, if it appears that he has been 
guilty of no negligence." </p>
<p>Had counsel continued the quotation a little further and had he thus been 
entirely frank with the court, he would have found the following:</p>
<p>"A continuance is properly refused where it appears that the party is not too 
ill to attend trial. <em>The fact of illness must be established by some 
satisfactory sworn statement, either in the shape of an affidavit or the 
certificate of a physician that satisfies the court of the inability of the 
party to be present. From the very nature of the relief asked the decision of 
the question must necessarily rest almost entirely within the discretion of the 
trial court</em>, and such discretion will not be interfered with unless the 
same has been abused to the extent of prejudicing the applicant's right to a 
fair trial of the cause.</p>
<p>In one of the cases cited in the Encyclopedia, coming from the Supreme Court 
of Georgia, it was held that "where there was much evidence pro and con as to 
whether an absent party 'was able to attend court, and what was his condition,' 
the discretion of a trial judge in refusing to continue a case on the ground of 
the sickness of such party will not be interfered with." (Fletcher <em>vs</em>. 
Collins [1900], 111 Ga., 253.)</p>
<p>The rule above set forth is a proper one. Applying it to our facts, we note 
that it does not appear that defendant was too ill to attend the trial, and that 
the fact of illness was not established by a satisfactory sworn statement of a 
physician. We cannot, in this instance, fairly say that the trial judge abused 
his discretion to the extent of prejudicing the applicant's right to a fair 
trial of the cause, for, considering the state of the pleadings and the admitted 
genuineness of the written document, there was left little or nothing to be 
proved.</p>
<p>Judgment is affirmed with interest and costs. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson, Street, Avance√±a</em>, and <em>Fisher, 
JJ.</em>, concur.</p></div>
