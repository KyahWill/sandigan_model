				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"><div align="JUSTIFY"> The trial court&nbsp; found&nbsp; and the evidence of&nbsp; record&nbsp; conclusively establishes that the defendant and appellant threw the contents of a bottle of sulphuric acid into the face and on the body of the complaining witness, inflicting wounds which resulted in the illness&nbsp; (<i>enfermedad</i>) of the injured man for more than&nbsp; thirty days.&nbsp; It was further&nbsp; proven that the attack was&nbsp; made treacherously (<i>con alevosia</i>), as that circumstance is denned&nbsp; in&nbsp; article&nbsp; 10 of the Penal&nbsp; Code,&nbsp; it having been made at&nbsp; night, from behind&nbsp; the shelter of a sheet of zinc, and at&nbsp; a time when the victim was wholly unprepared to make any defense, he not having any reason to anticipate an assault so unexpected and unusual.<br><br>The trial&nbsp; court found the&nbsp; defendant guilty of the crime of lesiones denned in subsection 4 of article 416&nbsp; read together with article 417 of the Penal Code, marked with the aggravating circumstance of nocturnity, and sentenced him to imprisonment for 1 year and&nbsp; 1&nbsp; day.&nbsp; But the commission of the crime having been marked&nbsp; with the qualifying circumstance of treachery,&nbsp; the special&nbsp; penalty&nbsp; prescribed in the last paragraph of article 416&nbsp; should have been inflicted, that is to say,&nbsp; the&nbsp; penalty of <i>prision&nbsp; correccional</i> in its minimum and medium degrees.&nbsp; This penalty should&nbsp; have been imposed in its medium degree, the commission of the offense not&nbsp; having been marked by aggravating or extenuating&nbsp; circumstances,&nbsp; the&nbsp; aggravating circumstance&nbsp; of nocturnity as found&nbsp; by&nbsp; the trial&nbsp; court being taken into consideration in the finding of the existence of the qualifying circumstance of <i>alevosia</i>.<br><br>We should add that the crime as committed&nbsp; is not in any wise related to the offenses&nbsp; defined and penalized in article 417 of the code, as found by the&nbsp; trial court, the provisions of which clearly relate to the use of poisons and the like in an entirely different manner.<br><br>The sentence&nbsp; imposed by&nbsp; the trial&nbsp; court is&nbsp; therefore reversed, and&nbsp; instead thereof,&nbsp; we sentence the defendant and appellant to two years of <i>prision correccional,</i> together with the accessory penalties prescribed by law, and to the payment of the costs of both instances.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J., Mapa, Moreland, </i>and <i>Trent, JJ</i>.,&nbsp; concur.<br></div></div>
