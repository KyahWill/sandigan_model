				<BR><STRONG>MAPA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is an action for the recovery of a  credit of 690.18 pesos assigned  to  the  plaintiff by  the Chinaman, Tan-Yngco, or Ynga.  The court below entered  judgment  in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of 110 pesos, 6 <em>reales</em> and 10 <em>cuartos</em>,  Mexican currency, and  legal interest thereon from the date of the filing of the complaint,.absolving the defendant from the balance, without express provision  as to costs.   The plaintiff excepted to this judgment, made a motion for a new  trial,  and has brought the case to this court for review.</p>
<p>The plaintiff in order to prove his claim introduced in evidence three different notes signed by  the defendant, making a total of 110 pesos, 6 <em>reales</em> and 10 <em>cuartos</em>, and a book, which, according to the Avitness Tan-Yngco, assignor of the said credit, contained a statement of the account of the defendant.  The  latter admitted the authenticity of the notes above referred to.   That part of the judgment of the court  below  condemning the defendant  to  pay  the amount of the said notes, and which the defendant, himself, admitted that he had voluntarily offered to pay prior to the commencement  of this action,  is therefore fully justified by the evidence.</p>
<p>The entries appearing in the book in question are  the only proof  introduced by the plaintiff as to the balance of the credit claimed; they were apparently made in Chinese characters  which  Avere read by one of the  plaintiff's witnesses at the  trial.  It appears from these  entries that at various times between the 26th of May and the 25th of September, 1898, the defendant borrowed several amounts aggregating 600 pesos.</p>
<p>With  reference to these entries the Avitness Tan-Yngco testified  as  folloAvs: "Salas  (the defendant) OAved him 690.18 pesos; that this indebtedness appears in his book; that it was entered  in his book by the Chinese clerk, Salvador Sia-Cayco;  that the said Salvador  is noAv. dead." He further  testified  that "all  the sums borroAved by Salas Avere entered  by his  cashier, Salvador, in the book  in question."  And finally, testifying as a Avitness in rebuttal, said that "he knows of the sums borroAved by Salas because <em>he was told</em> by  Salvador Avho made the entries in the book."</p>
<p>It is to be inferred from this testimony that the amounts borroAved by Salas Avere received by him directly from the cashier Salvador and not from Tan-Yngco.  He knew  of it simply because  Salvador told him.  Tan-Yngco, in his testimony, did not  say positively that  he himself had delivered any sum of money to the defendant in this case. Consequently his testimony is merely hearsay and does not prove the existence of the indebtedness in question.</p>
<p>There  is no proof upon this  point other than  the entries appearing in the book referred to, and the question reduces itself to determining the probatory force of those entries. It was proved at the trial that the cashier, Salvador, who kept  the book in question,  was  dead,  and the plaintiff sought to avail himself of the provisions of section 328 of the Code of Civil Procedure which provides that the writings of a deceased person may be read as <em>prima facie</em> evidence of the facts therein stated.</p>
<p>This  legal provision may  be successfully invoked provided the authenticity of the manuscript in question  has been  first satisfactorily established.   In the  case  at  bar there is not  the slightest proof upon this  point; no  one testified to having seen the  deceased  Salvador write the entries  in question.   Tan-Yngco himself, who is the only witness  who referred  to  the book where these entries appear, did not make any positive statement to this effect. The only thing he said was that Salvador kept the book and made the entries in regard to the amount borrowed by the defendant.  This  general  statement indicates or  might indicate that the making of this  entry  Avas intrusted by Tan-Yngco to the deceased Salvador in the ordinary course of business, but it does not necessarily prove that Salvador. actually made the entries himself.  These entries might have been easily made by some one else, notwithstanding the fact that this work was ordinarily performed by Salvador,  At least it does not appear conclusively that he and no one else made these entries.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is not even an indication of the exact date upon which these entries were made, which always  constitutes  an important  detail  when the  manuscript of a deceased person is intended to be used as proof. Section 328 above cited requires that  the manuscript intended to be utilized as evidence should be made <em>at or near</em> the time of the transaction.</p>
<p>Nor has the handwriting of these entries been compared with the actual handwriting of the deceased, Salvador; nor has the authenticity of those entries, which is the fundamental basis for  the application  of the  above-mentioned legal provisions, been established  in any  other competent manner.</p>
<p>Whatever may be the true construction of the provisions of the aforesaid station 328, upon wliich the partis to this action  do not agree, and which it  is not necessary for us to decide for the purpose  of this decision,  we hold  the entries in question did not  nor can they constitute <em>prima facie</em> evidence in this particular case because they were not properly  identified as  being in the authentic handwriting of tlie deceased, Salvador.</p>
<p>For  the reasons above stated and not upon the ground set out in the judgment of the court  below, the same is aflirmed  in  all respects, with the costs of this  instance against the appellant.  After  the expiration  of  twenty days let judgment be entered  in accordance herewith and the  case  remanded in  due time to the court below  for execution.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano,  C. J., Torres, Johnson, Carson, Willard,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
