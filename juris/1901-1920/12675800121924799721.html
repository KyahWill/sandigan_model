From that decision Santiago Vaño appealed&nbsp; to the Collector of Customs, where the decision of the board of special inquiry refusing&nbsp; him permission to land the Philippine Islands was affirmed.</p><p>Later Santiago Vaño presented a petition for the writ of habeas corpus to the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, which was denied an was ordered to be remanded to the custody&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Collector of Customs in order that the judgment of the&nbsp; Collector ordering his deportation might be carried into effect.</p><p>From that decision of the Court of First Instance Santiago Vaño appealed this court.</p><p>It is claimed&nbsp; on the&nbsp; part of the&nbsp; appellant that he was born&nbsp; in the city of&nbsp; Cebu, Philippine Islands, on&nbsp; the 11th of October, 1892, and has lived in Islands ever&nbsp; since his birth, except for a&nbsp; period of about six months, his father,&nbsp; by reason of ill health, visited China, taking him and his t mentioned above, with him; that his father died&nbsp; in China from said infirmity that he and his two sisters,&nbsp; immediately after the death of his father, returned to the&nbsp; Philippine Islands on the steamship <span style="font-style: italic;">Rubi</span>, on or about the 19th of October,&nbsp; 1909;&nbsp; that his mother was Filipina woman and had died some years before his father took him and his two sisters&nbsp; to China; that he had an older brother in the&nbsp; Philippine Islands, in the Province of Cebu, who was to look after him and his two sisters; that only relatives&nbsp; which&nbsp; he has are residents of the Philippine Islands; the father and mother were residents of the Philippine Islands at the time of American occupation and had been for many years theretofore; that at the time he accompanied his father and sisters to China it was with the&nbsp; express intention of returning to the&nbsp; Philippine Islands.</p><p>He presents several recommendations, one signed by Mr. Gilbert, supervising teacher of Dumanhug of the Province of Cebu,&nbsp; in&nbsp; which he is recommended very highly&nbsp; as&nbsp; a student,&nbsp; together with the statement that he&nbsp; had bee a student in the American schools of the Philippine Islands for a period five years and had made very&nbsp; rapid progress.&nbsp; He also&nbsp; presents a certificate&nbsp; from the&nbsp; division superintendent of schools of&nbsp; the Province Cebu, in which it is stated that he was a student and had completed the course of study&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; fourth&nbsp; grade.&nbsp; He presents also letters of recommendation from the&nbsp; municipal president of the municipality of Malabuyog of the Province of Cebu, as well as a certificate of residence issued by the Insular collector of customs of the port of Cebu.</p><p>There&nbsp; can be no question about the&nbsp; identity of Santiago Vaño. The foregoing facts are not denied.&nbsp; The only question presented to this court under the facts found in the record is whether or not he is a citizen and entitled to remain&nbsp; in, the Philippine Islands, even though he is Chinese&nbsp; descent.&nbsp;&nbsp; That question&nbsp; has been decided by this court in&nbsp; the affirmative in the cases of U.
