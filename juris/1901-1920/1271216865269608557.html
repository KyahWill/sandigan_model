				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The complaint in this action is styled by the plaintiffs themselves as a 
"complaint in an action of quo warranto."
<p>The plaintiffs allege that the municipality of Cardona, Province of Rizal, is 
a municipal corporation containing within its confines the barrios of Tatala, 
Balatik, Nambug, Tutulo, Mahabang Parang, Nagsulo, Sampad, and Bonot; that 
Binongonan is a municipal corporation of the Province of Rizal, which is now 
exercising or pretending to exercise jurisdiction over the said barrios of 
Tatala, Balatik, Nambug, Tutulo, Mahabang Parang, Nagsulo, Sampad, and Bonot, 
although said barrios are not politically within the confines or limits of the 
said municipality of Binangonan, "thereby usurping the powers and jurisdiction 
of the municipal council of Cardona within whose limits said barrios are 
located;" that the defendant L. R. Brown is a district engineer in the Province 
of Rizal and that he is about to destroy and remove the ancient monuments which 
mark the limits of the municipality of Binangonan, Province of Rizal, and is now 
about to construct new monuments in place of the old, but locating them in such 
manner that the barrios above named will be excluded from the territorial limits 
of Cardona and included within those of Binangonan. </p>
<p>The plaintiffs further allege that the power of organizing municipalities and 
of fixing their territorial limits resides exclusively in the Legislature, 
having been placed there by the Philippine Bill, and that the Legislature has 
not passed any law or given any authorization to any corporation or person to 
separate said barrios from the municipality of Cardona and incorporate them in 
that of Binangonan; that the only authority which the said municipality of 
Binangonan and the said engineer assert for the changing of the limits of the 
said municipalities is an Executive Order, No. 66, series of 1914, issued by the 
Governor-General of the Philippine Islands, authorizing and directing that said 
limits be changed in the manner in which the defendants are now attempting to 
change them.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs further allege that the Philippine Bill does not authorize the 
Governor-General or the Legislature to delegate to any person or corporation the 
power to change the territorial limits of municipalities and that Act No. 1748, 
under which the said executive order was issued, is, therefore, 
unconstitutional, the Legislature having in that Act attempted to delegate its 
power to the Governor-General of the Islands; that said executive order is, in 
effect, an amendment and repeal of the general laws of the Islands organizing 
provinces and municipalities and fixing their respective limits, and is, 
therefore, void and of no effect.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs further allege that, aside from being violative of the 
Philippine Bill, said order does not comply with Act No. 1748 referred to 
because it does not affirmatively set forth that it is made for the public 
benefit, as required by section 1 of said Act. </p>
<p>Upon these allegations plaintiffs pray "that judgment be rendered in their 
favor declaring the municipality of Binangonan an illegal usurper of the powers, 
faculties, and duties of the municipality of Cardona with respect to the barrios 
of Tatala, Balatik, Nambug, Tutulo, Mahabang Parang, Nagsulo, Sampad, and Bonot; 
and that the court issue, pending trial, a preliminary injunction against the 
defendant L. R. Brown, district engineer of the Province of Rizal, ordering him 
to abstain until the further order of this court from destroying the ancient 
monuments which mark the municipal limits of Binangonan and Cardona and 
constructing others in their stead."</p>
<p>The complaint is signed by Modesto Reyes and Eliseo Ymzon, "attorneys for the 
municipality of Cardona." As showing their authority to appear for the 
Government of the Philippine Islands, which is also a nominal plaintiff, the 
plaintiffs in this case allege "that on the 19th of August, 1914, the 
undersigned, in the name and representation of the municipality of Cardona, 
directed a communication to the Honorable Attorney-General asking him to begin 
the presentaction of quo warranto, but that said Honorable Attorney-General 
refused and still refuses to do so."</p>
<p>The only point which we undertake at this moment to decide is whether or not 
the plaintiff is entitled to a preliminary injunction upon the facts stated.</p>
<p>Under section 166 of the Code of Civil Procedure one of the conditions 
precedent to the issuance of a preliminary injunction is that "the complaint 
must show facts entitling the plaintiff to the relief demanded," that "the 
complaint must be verified by the oath of the plaintiff or by that of some other 
person by him duly authorized and who can testify to the truth of the facts set 
forth in the complaint," and that "the plaintiff must file with the clerk of the 
court in which the action is pending a written obligation on the part of the 
plaintiff, with sufficient sureties, to the effect that the plaintiff will pay 
to the party enjoined all such damages as such party may sustain by reason of 
the injunction, if the court should finally decide that the plaintiff was not 
entitled thereto." It is provided by section 164 of said code that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A preliminary injunction may be granted when it is established, in the 
manner hereinafter provided, to the satisfaction of the judge granting it:</p>
<p>"1. That the plaintiff is entitled to the relief demanded and such relief, or 
any part thereof, consists in restraining the commission or continuance of the 
acts complained of either for a limited period or perpetually;</p>
<p>"2. That the commission or continuance of some act complained of during the 
litigation would probably work injustice to the plaintiff;</p>
<p>"3. That the defendant is doing, or threatens, or is about to do, or is 
procuring or suffering to be done, some act probably in violation of the 
plaintiff's rights, respecting the subject of the action, and tending to render 
the judgment ineffectual.'</p></blockquote>
<p>A simple reading of the complaint and the record will demonstrate that the 
plaintiffs have not met the requirements of these sections. While we do not 
examine into the sufficiency of the complaint where no preliminary relief is 
prayed for, leaving that matter to be brought to our attention by the defendant, 
we do take into consideration the sufficiency of the complaint in respect of the 
remedy prayed for when we are asked to issue a preliminary injunction. The Code 
of Civil Procedure, as we have seen, expressly lays that duty upon us; and, 
under said code, we are not permitted to issue a preliminary injunction unless 
the facts set out in the complaint show that the plaintiff is entitled to the 
relief prayed for, and it appears that all the other requirements named in the 
code are fully complied with.</p>
<p>This action is not properly one of quo warranto and the court has no 
authority under the facts stated to "declare the municipality of Binangonan an 
illegal usurper of the powers, faculties, and duties of the municipality of 
Cardona with respect to the barrios of Tatala, Balatik, Nambug, Tutulo, Mahabang 
Parang, Nagsulo, Sampad, and Bonot." The facts alleged do not bring the case 
within the provisions of section 197 and following sections of the Code of Civil 
Procedure which deal with the action of quo warranto. It is not a case where a 
person has usurped, intruded into, or unlawfully holds or exercises a public 
civil office or a franchise within the Philippine Islands, or an office in a 
corporation created by the authority of the Government of the Philippine 
Islands, or a case where a public civil official commits or suffers an act which 
by the provisions of law works a forfeiture of his office, or where a body of 
persons act as a corporation within the Philippine Islands without being legally 
incorporated or without lawful authority so to act. The action is not against a 
corporation founded upon the fact that it has offended against a provision of. a 
statute relative to its creation or renewal, or which alters or amends the same, 
that it has forfeited its privileges and franchise by nonuser, or has committed 
an act which amounts to a surrender of its corporate rights, privileges, or 
franchise, or that it has misused a franchise, privilege, or right conferred 
upon it by law, or that it has exercised a franchise, privilege, or right in 
contravention of law, The case at bar seems to be, so far as the allegations of 
the complaint are concerned, an attempt on the part of the defendants to move 
the boundary lines between two municipalities in such a way as apparently to 
increase the territory of one and decrease that of the other. If this attempt is 
illegal, then an action permanently to restrain the effort would perhaps be one 
of the remedies which plaintiff might invoke; but the action of quo warranto is 
wholly unfitted to meet the exigencies of the case set forth. It relates solely 
to persons who usurp, intrude into, or unlawfully hold or exercise a public 
office or who do or suffer an act which by the provisions of law works a 
forfeiture of their office. In other words, it applies exclusively to persons 
who have no title to the office which they pretend to hold and the functions 
which they assume to exercise. It does not apply to persons who, having a legal 
title to an office, exercise the functions of that office beyond their proper 
limits or exceed the power and jurisdiction which is conferred upon that office 
by law. In the case before us no allegation of usurpation is made which is 
supported by any fact stated in the petition.</p>
<p>While the action of quo warranto may also be begun against corporations, it 
is upon the same terms and for the same reasons which authorize it against 
persons. The corporation must act without being legally incorporated or it must 
have on ended against some provision of law in such a manner as to forfeit its 
privileges and franchise, or it must have surrendered its corporate rights, 
privileges, or franchise. In a word, before the action can be begun against 
either a person or a corporation, it must appear that such person or corporation 
has no title to the office the functions of which he or it seeks to 
exercise.</p>
<p>While the defendant municipality may not have legal authority to exercise 
jurisdiction over the barrios named in the complaint as having been transferred 
from the plaintiff to the defendant municipality, it is nevertheless admitted 
that it is a municipal corporation with the power and authority to exercise 
municipal prerogatives. The fact that it may have attempted to exercise 
jurisdiction over a strip of territory beyond its limits will not warrant an 
action of quo warranto, which, under the code, is founded upon the usurpation of 
an office or franchise.</p>
<p>The motion for a preliminary injunction is denied.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson, Carson,</em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.,</em> 
concur.</p>
