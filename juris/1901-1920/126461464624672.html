				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>It appears from the statements in the information filed by the  provincial fiscal  of Pangasinan on the 22d of October, 1902, that the two accused and five other persons were in the  office of the municipal treasurer of the town of Bautista; that <em>lucri causa</em> they committed  the crime of theft, by taking several checks, American bank notes, and two warrants against the provincial treasurer of Pangasinan, of the total value  of $3,477.16 3/8 , Mexican, and which were in two envelopes in the pocket of the coat of Graciano Bautista,  deputy provincial treasurer, which coat, as appeared subsequently in the course of  the trial, its owner had taken off on account of the heat and had left it hanging on the edge of the  writing table where Ramon Reynado, the municipal treasurer of said town, was working; that between 6  and 7  o'clock at night on the said date, after they had finished the work of collecting the taxes, deputy Graciano  Bautista noticed that the envelopes containing the said  valuable documents had disappeared from his pocket, and that he, in consequence, immediately reported the loss to the local authorities.</p>
<p>Although the charge  was first  brought against the two accused and Honorato Carungay, Hilario Caneja, Norberto Alviar, Jose Santos, and Simeon de Guzman, because the latter were in  the  same  office at the time in which the taking  of  these documents must  have occurred, nevertheless, during the course  of the trial, the court, in view of the result of the proceedings, and acting in accordance with tin1 opinion of the prosecuting attorney, directed an acquittal of the last five accused, to the end that they might be called as  witnesses against the  first two,  Balboa and Reynado.</p>
<p>The fact related, if proven, would constitute the crime of theft, defined and punished  by  articles 517 and 518 of the Penal Code,  inasmuch  as  the valuable  papers  were taken <em>lucri causa</em> from the pocket of the coat of the deputy, Graciano Bautista, without violence  or intimidation of the person, or  the  employment of force.   Some  of these papers were bank notes of the value of $157, all having been obtained from taxes collected in the said town of Bautista.</p>
<p>The two accused plead not guilty to the crime with which they  were charged.   The only evidence against them disclosed by the record of the case is the testimony of the deputy, Graciano Bautista.  He testifies that on the afternoon  of the 22d of August, 1902, he was in the office of the municipal treasurer, engaged in collecting taxes;  that the two  accused, Balboa and Reynado, were  there,  as also Honorato Carungay, Norberto Alviar, Jose Santos, Hilario Caneja, and Simeon de  Guzman, who  remained there all that afternoon; that the said Balboa and Reynado knew that the checks, warrants, and bank notes in two envelopes were  in the pocket of his coat,  which he had  left  hanging on the edge of the desk where Reynado was working; that shortly after Graciano Bautista saw Balboa and Reynado get up and take seats near the place  where his coat was hanging; that a few moments before he noticed the disappearance of the said documents the two  accused  left the omce, while the others remained there, and therefore the witness presumes that they were  the  persons  who committed the offense.   The record also disclosed the fact that, when  Graciano Bautista gave the  alarm upon the disappearance of the money, the accused, Balboa and Reynado, returned to the office; that when it was suggested that all present be searched, Graciano  Bautista  objected to this operation;  that in  the  course  of  the afternoon  Balboa picked up some papers which had fallen near or under the writing table where the coat was hanging, and that Balboa was nervous that afternoon.</p>
<p>Although the record disclosed the source of the checks, warrants,  and bank notes concerning the theft of: which this case  deals, the  record  does not  disclose sufficient evidence that  these papers were  actually  placed  in the pocket of the coat,  there being no witness who saw them placed there,  and, therefore, in view of the fact that  no search was made of the persons present  in the room,  as suggested  by  Deputy Bautista, some doubt arises, as  to whether or not the crime charged  in this  information lias been committed.</p>
<p>The evidence for  the prosecution is not satisfactory  or conclusive, or of such weight and character as to remove all reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.  The mere fact that they were in the office on the afternoon  of the occurrence is  not sufficient proof of their guilt, any more than it was of that of the five men who were acquitted, but who were also present at the place at the time at which the theft was  supposed to be committed.</p>
<p>Even in case the innocence of the accused should appear doubtful, it  not  being  possible  to  determine  from the evidence which of the two is the one guilty of the theft, the presumption of innocence exists  in favor  of each  of them.  Their guilt not having been satisfactorily proven, we are of the opinion that they are entitled to acquittal. (Sec. 57, G. O., 58.)</p>
<p>Therefore the judgment  below must  be reversed.   The accused, Mariano Balboa and Ramon Reynado, are acquitted, with the costs of both instances <em>de oficio</em>.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Cooper, Willard, Mapa,</em> and <em> Ladd,  JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em> McDonough, J.,</em> did not sit in this case.<br>
