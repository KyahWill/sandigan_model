				<BR><STRONG>MORELAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a motion made in this court to appoint a receiver in a foreclosure 
action or, in case the court refuse to appoint a receiver, to issue an execution 
upon the judgment contained in the action or require the defendant to file a 
bond in the sum of P75,000 to guarantee the payment of the judgment in case it 
is affirmed by this court.
<p>A proceeding for the appointment of a receiver should be by petition and not 
by motion. The petition should be verified and should have attached to it such 
affidavits as the petitioner may deem necessary for the substantiation of the 
allegations set forth in the petition. The present proceeding is by motion and 
the moving papers are not verified.</p>
<p>The power to appoint a receiver is a delicate one and should be exercised 
with extreme caution and only under circumstances requiring summary relief or 
where the court is satisfied that there is imminent danger of loss, lest the 
injury thereby caused be far greater than the injury sought to be averted. The 
court should consider the consequences to all of the parties and the power 
should not be exercised when it is likely to produce irreparable injustice or 
injury to private rights or the facts demonstrate that the appointment will 
injure the interests of others whose rights are entitled to as much 
consideration from the court as those of the complainant. This being the case, 
the papers upon which the petition for the appointment of a receiver are based 
should be verified and should contain all the facts required to show a clear 
right to the relief.</p>
<p>The question has not been raised or discussed whether this court has 
authority to appoint a receiver in an action pending here on appeal. We do not, 
therefore, decide that question. A majority of the court believe that whether 
the court has that right or not, the result would be the same, as the motion 
could not prevail in either event.</p>
<p>We are of the opinion that, although the case has been appealed and the 
appeal perfected, the Court of First Instance still has the power to hear and 
decide an application for the appointment of a receiver. It may be contended 
against the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance that no action was 
pending in that court to which the petition for the appointment of a receiver 
could become ancillary and that an appeal from the original judgment to this 
court had been perfected, the allowance of the bill of exceptions having the 
effect to stay all further proceedings in the case. In reply to such contention 
we might say that, although the cause has been appealed to the Supreme Court, it 
may be regarded as yet pending for the purpose of an application for a receiver 
and we are of the opinion that the court that rendered the decree appealed from 
is the proper court to hear and determine such an application. The office of a 
receiver is manifestly to aid, by the preservation of property, in making 
effective the court's decree.</p>
<p>It has always been regarded as an auxiliary or ancillary proceeding and 
rarely, if ever, as an independent one. If occurrences arise after decree which 
threaten the effectiveness of the decree, the court has the power then to make 
the appointment. The questions raised on the appointment of a receiver do not 
involve any matter litigated by the appeal. (Brinkman <em>vs.</em> Ritzinger, 82 
Ind., 358; Chicago &amp; South-eastern Railway Co. <em>vs</em>. St. Clair, 144 
Ind., 371; Moran<em> vs.</em> Johnston, 26 Grat., Va., 108; Adkins <em>vs</em>. 
Edwards, 83 Va., 316.)</p>
<p>Even though we held that this court has authority to appoint a receiver in an 
action pending on appeal, we should not exercise that authority under the facts 
and circumstances of this case. This court is not provided with adequate 
resources and machinery for dealing with the situation presented by the 
appointment of a receiver and all of the details connected therewith. It would 
impose upon us obligations and duties which we are not fully prepared to 
discharge and which we are not called upon to meet under the circumstances.</p>
<p>With respect to that portion of the motion asking for the issuance of an 
execution, should the court refuse to appoint a receiver, we have to say:</p>
<p>Section 144 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Except by special order of the court, no execution shall issue upon a final 
judgment rendered in a Court of First Instance until after the period for 
perfecting a bill of exceptions has expired. But the filing of a bill of 
exceptions shall of itself stay execution until the final determination of the 
action, unless for special reasons stated in the bill of exceptions the court 
shall order that execution be not stayed, in which event execution may at once 
issue. But the court may require as a condition of a stay of execution that a 
bond shall be given reasonably sufficient to secure the performance of the 
judgment appealed from in case it be affirmed in part or 
wholly."</p></blockquote>
<p>In the case of Macke <em>vs.</em> Camps (5 Phil. Rep., 185), the court said: 
"Thus the legislator has placed the issuance of the order complained of in the 
discretion of the trial court, and this court will not interfere to modify, 
control, or inquire into the exercise of this discretion, which is thus 
conferred by statute, unless it be alleged and proven that there has been an 
abuse or excess of authority on the part of the trial judge, or unless it 
appears that since the issuance of the order conditions have so far changed as 
to necessitate the intervention of the appellate court to protect the interests 
of the parties against contingencies which were not contemplated by the trial 
judge at the time of the issuance of the order. (Jerome <em>vs.</em> McCarter, 
21 Wallace, 88 U. S., 17; Calvo <em>vs.</em> Gutierrez, 4 Phil. Rep., 203.)"</p>
<p>Therefore, even though this court has authority to issue an execution in an 
action pending on appeal, a question which we do not decide, we would not issue 
it in this case upon the showing made for the reasons expressed in the decision 
above cited. No change in condition or circumstance has been shown since the 
execution was stayed in the court below which would warrant our 
interference.</p>
<p>The reasons which lead to the denial of the motion to issue an execution also 
require the denial of the motion to require the defendant to give the bond 
mentioned in the moving papers. </p>
<p>The motion must be denied in all its parts.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres,</em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em>Johnson, J.,</em> concurs in the result.</p>

<div align="center"><br><br><br><em>CONCURRING</em> 
<p></p></div>
<p><strong>CARSON, J.</strong></p>
<p>Understanding as I do that nothing said in this opinion is intended to be 
taken as a ruling that this court has not the power in an appropriate case to 
take such measures as may be necessary to conserve the subject matter in 
litigation pending the final disposition of such case, either by the appointment 
of a receiver, or the requirement of bond for the continued stay of execution or 
by granting such other remedy as the facts of the particular case may require, I 
concur.<br><br></p></div>
