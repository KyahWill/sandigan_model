				<BR><STRONG>MAPA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The parties to this suit admit that the land, the recovery of the possession of which the plaintiffs endeavor to&nbsp; obtain, belonged to Jose Velasquez,&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter's father,&nbsp; until the year 1897; that in that year the said Velasquez was married, in second wedlock, to Maria&nbsp; Soratos to whom&nbsp; he gave the said land in dowry by a private document which the plaintiffs signed in proof of their assent&nbsp; to the&nbsp; creation of the said dowry in favor of their stepmother,&nbsp; Maria Soratos; and, that the latter,&nbsp; after Velasquez' death,&nbsp; sold the land aforementioned, in the year 1904, to the herein defendant who has been in possession thereof&nbsp; ever since, under such a title, as owner.<br><br>In view of these facts the court decided the case in favor of the plaintiffs, on the ground that the gift of the land as a dowry, to Maria Soratos, made as it was by a private document,&nbsp; was&nbsp; entirely null&nbsp; and void&nbsp; in law,&nbsp; for which reason it could not convey the ownership of&nbsp; the said land to Maria Soratos&nbsp; who, consequently,&nbsp; could&nbsp; not transfer the same, by contract of purchase and&nbsp; sale,&nbsp; to&nbsp; the herein defendant.<br><br>This conclusion of the court is entirely&nbsp; in accord&nbsp; with the&nbsp; law and should&nbsp; be affirmed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The legal&nbsp; provisions relative to the necessity of the execution of a&nbsp; public instrument to&nbsp; impart validity to the creation of&nbsp; a&nbsp; dowry when, as in the present case, it consists of real property, are&nbsp; clear and precise.<br><br>Article 1338 of the Civil Code prescribes as&nbsp; follows:<br><blockquote>"The parents and relatives of the spouses and the persons not belonging to the family may create the dowry in favor of the wife,&nbsp; either before or after&nbsp; the celebration of the marriage.<br><br>"The husband may also&nbsp; create it before the marriage, but not after it."<br><br>"A dowry&nbsp; created," textually says article 1339, "before or at the time of the celebration of the marriage shall be governed in all that is not provided&nbsp; in this chapter by the rules for gifts made in&nbsp; consideration thereof."<br></blockquote>And these&nbsp; gifts, that is to say, those made by reason of the marriage or in&nbsp; consideration&nbsp; thereof, are&nbsp; governed, according to&nbsp; article 1328, by the rules established in title 2 of book 3, among which is found the provisions of article 633, the literal tenor of which is, in part, as follows:<br><blockquote>"In order that a gift of real property may be valid it&nbsp; shall be made in a public instrument, stating therein in detail the property bestowed as a gift and&nbsp; the&nbsp; amount&nbsp; of the charges which the done must satisfy."<br></blockquote>This last provision being applicable in the matter of the dowry herein concerned, it is&nbsp; evident&nbsp; that, pursuant to articles 1339 and 1328, cited above, the creation of the said dowry is null and void because it was not made in a public instrument, prescribed&nbsp; by law&nbsp; as a necessary and indispensable requisite for its validity.<br><br>The appellant&nbsp; maintains&nbsp; that the&nbsp; execution of a public instrument is not necessary for the creation of a dowry, except in the case where it is intended to enforce it against a third&nbsp; person, and, in support&nbsp; of this theory, he cites article 1280 of the Civil Code, which provides as follows:<br><blockquote>"The following must appear in a public instrument:<br><center><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></center><br>"3. Marriage contracts, and the creation and increase of dowries, whenever&nbsp; it is&nbsp; intended&nbsp; to&nbsp; enforce them&nbsp; against third persons."<br></blockquote>From&nbsp; this the appellant makes the deduction that&nbsp; the creation&nbsp; of a dowry is valid and effective among the same parties who&nbsp; intervened&nbsp; therein, without need of a public instrument.&nbsp; As&nbsp; may be seen, the appellant's argument is based on a mere inference, and not on the language of the law.&nbsp; Opposed to this inference, there are categorical and definite legal provisions which destroy it completely.&nbsp; Thus, for example, with respect to marriage contracts, there is article 1321 of the Civil&nbsp; Code, which&nbsp; prescribes that "marriage contracts&nbsp; and modifications&nbsp; made&nbsp; therein <i>must&nbsp; be contained in a public instrument</i> executed before the celebration of the marriage."<br><br>Explaining the meaning and scope of this article, Manresa, in&nbsp; his&nbsp; Commentaries on&nbsp; the&nbsp; Civil Code,&nbsp; says&nbsp; that "marriage&nbsp; contracts contained in private documents have no force whatever, <i>either between the parties</i> or as regards third parties"&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is not enough, then," he adds in another part of&nbsp; the same Commentaries, "that&nbsp; the act be recorded in writing, even in a public document; a public instrument, executed&nbsp; before a notary, is&nbsp; absolutely necessary."<br><br>And Mucius&nbsp; Scsevola says,&nbsp; in&nbsp; commenting on the&nbsp; said article 1280, in&nbsp; connection with article 1321:<br><blockquote>"The deduction appears to be made from the rule of the code that when&nbsp; it is not intended to enforce the said&nbsp; contracts (marriage contracts, creation and increase of&nbsp; dowry) against third persons, the formality of an instrument&nbsp; may be dispensed with;&nbsp; but,&nbsp; aside from the fact that&nbsp; the expression is absolutely incorrect, because reference was made to the intention, which implies a general protective measure for third parties, we find that article&nbsp; 1321, without&nbsp; any distinction whatever <i>between&nbsp; prejudice&nbsp; and no&nbsp; prejudice to third persons</i>, directs that marriage contracts and modifications made therein must be contained in a public instrument executed before the celebration of the marriage."<br></blockquote>Restricting the discussion to the dowry, it has already been herein before shown that its creation is subject to the rules governing gifts, and that one of these rules, established by article 633 of the Civil Code, requires the execution of a&nbsp; public instrument to validate the gift of real property and, therefore,&nbsp; likewise the&nbsp; creation of&nbsp; a&nbsp; dowry when it consists of real&nbsp; property.<br><br>In his commentary on the said article 633,&nbsp; Manresa&nbsp; lays down the following:<br><blockquote>"The gift of real property is valid only when made by a public instrument.&nbsp; The framers of the Civil Code did not believe that sufficient force would be given to such&nbsp; a&nbsp; gift by article 1280,&nbsp; according to which,&nbsp; acts and contracts, the object of which is the transmission of property rights, must appear in&nbsp; a public&nbsp; instrument,&nbsp; because article 633 does not require any&nbsp; special&nbsp; formality with which the&nbsp; contracting parties may compel each other&nbsp; to&nbsp; comply,&nbsp; when once they have validly bound themselves&nbsp; to fulfill the obligation (article 1279), but the <i>validity of the gift is made to depend upon that formality."</i><br></blockquote>The same author, in another part of his work, says:<br><blockquote>"Article 633 provides, in order that a gift of real property may be valid, that it must be made by a public&nbsp; instrument&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; can not be&nbsp; denied&nbsp; that the law&nbsp; requires a public instrument as a necessary requisite for validity, not as a mere formality or as a probatory document&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *, because if it could&nbsp; be&nbsp; dispensed&nbsp; with and the&nbsp; parties still be bound, at all events, in any form, the requirement would be ridiculous; a requirement which the law deems necessary for validity could be dispensed with, or,&nbsp; what amounts to the same thing, there would be no such necessity, nor would the instrument have any bearing whatever in&nbsp; the matter of the origin and force of the obligation&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *.&nbsp; It is not a question of form (he concludes), it is a question of substance."<br></blockquote>To the same extent that a public instrument&nbsp; is required for the validity&nbsp; of&nbsp; a gift, it is necessary for the creation of a dowry consisting of real property, even for those who execute it.<br><br>It is also maintained by the appellant that the plaintiffs are barred from challenging the validity of the&nbsp; creation of the dowry here&nbsp; in question,&nbsp; on account&nbsp; of their having consented to its&nbsp; creation and taken a direct part therein by&nbsp; signing the&nbsp; instrument in which&nbsp; a&nbsp; record&nbsp; was&nbsp; made of the conveyance&nbsp; of the&nbsp; land as&nbsp; a dowry to&nbsp; their stepmother, Maria Soratos; but,&nbsp; as the judge well&nbsp; says in&nbsp; the judgment appealed&nbsp; from, an&nbsp; instrument creates no impediment when&nbsp; it&nbsp; is&nbsp; a violation of a&nbsp; positive&nbsp; requirement established with reference to its&nbsp; validity and the&nbsp; form of its execution. This doctrine&nbsp; is recognized&nbsp;&nbsp; as true by the appellant himself;&nbsp; he says in his brief that "it is true that no impediment exists in an instrument when the instrument&nbsp; is&nbsp; null and&nbsp; void."&nbsp; And&nbsp; the&nbsp; private document subscribed by the plaintiffs, considered as an instrument of dowry, is in fact null, void, and ineffective.<br><br>The judgment&nbsp; appealed from&nbsp; is affirmed, with the costs of this instance&nbsp; against the appellant.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano, C.
