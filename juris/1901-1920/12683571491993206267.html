				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE, VS. PEDRO BAILON, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The defendant in this case was charged with the crime of parricide.<p></p>
<p>The proof shows that on the 1st day of April, 1904, in the pueblo of
Licab, of the Province of Nueva Ecija, because of some disagreement
existing between the accused and his wife, Paula Rayo, he did strike,
beat, and wound said Paula Rayo with a club, from the effects of which
wounds the said Paula Rayo died.</p>
<p>The Court of First Instance of the Province of Nueva Ecija found the
defendant guilty of the crime charged in the complaint and sentenced
him to the penalty of <em>cadena perpetua</em>, with the accessories
of civil interdiction and perpetual absolute disqualification and to
pay the costs. The attorney appointed to represent the defendant in
this court joins with the Solicitor-General of the Philippine Islands
in recommending that the sentence of said court be affirmed.</p>
<p>Upon examination of the proof the court finds the evidence
sufficient to sustain the facts alleged in the complaint, as well as to
justify the sentence of the Court of First Instance of said province.</p>
<p>The sentence of the Court of First Instance of the Province of Nueva Ecija is therefore affirmed. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, </em>and <em>Carson, JJ.,</em> concur.
