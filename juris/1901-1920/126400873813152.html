				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>These defendants were charged with the crime of illegal marriage, alleged to have been committed as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"On or about June 10, 1910, in the  municipality of  Opon of this  province and judicial district,  the accused Inez Ompad,  a girl 15  years of age, and  the  accused Dionisio Lomongsod,  who knew the age  of the said Inez Ompad, did without the knowledge or consent of her parents, contract civil marriage before the justice of the peace of said municipality; the accused Patricia Godinez, Fructuoso  Godinez, and Tito  Godinez did maliciously, intentionally, and criminally testify  under oath, before the justice  of the peace, that the accused  Inez  Ompad  was 18 years old on the day when her marriage ceremony was performed with her  coaccused  Dionisio Lomongsod, when they well knew that she was not so old; all in violation of law."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During the trial of the cause and at  the close  of the proof presented by the prosecuting attorney, the lower court found  that the evidence was insufficient to support the charges against the defendants, Tito Godinez, Patricia Godinez, and Fructuoso Godinez,  and dismissed the  complaint against them and discharged them from the  custody of the law, with three-fifths of the costs <em>de oficio.</em></p>
<p>At the close of the trial the Honorable Adolph Wislizenus, judge,  found that the defendants Dionisio Lomongsod and Inez Ompad were guilty of the crime charged in the complaint  and sentenced  them for a  violation of article 475 of the  Penal Code, giving them the  benefit  of  article  11 of said code, to be  imprisoned for a period of six months and  one  day of <em>prision correccional, </em>and each to pay one-fifth part of the costs.</p>
<p>From that sentence the defendants appealed  and made several assignments of error in this court.</p>
<p>The  complaint charges that upon the 10th  day of June, 1910, in  the  municipality  of  Opon, Province of  Cebu, the defendant Inez Ompad being 15 years of age, and the defendant Dionisio Lomongsod, were  married before a justice of the  peace, without  the consent or knowledge of the parents of the  said Inez  Ompad.  The marriage  was  celebrated  on the date mentioned.  The record shows that Inez Ompad was 16 years of age on the  date of  the  marriage and  that Dionisio Lomongsod was  18  years of age on such date.</p>
<p>The  basis of the  prosecution is that such marriage took place without the consent or knowledge  of the parents  of Inez Ompad and was therefore illegal.</p>
<p>Examining  the proof adduced during the  trial  of the cause,  we find no proof whatever that the said  marriage took place without  the consent of  the parents of the said Inez Ompad.  Her  father, for some  reason  or  other, did not appear at the trial of the cause.  The fiscal, during the trial, assumed to speak for  the father  of the  said  Inez Ompad, and stated that if her father were present he would testify that the marriage took place  without his consent. This statement of the fiscal, however, can not  be considered as proof in the cause.   There is, therefore, no evidence  in the record which shows that the defendants herein violated the provisions of article 475 of the Penal Code.   The judgment of the lower court must, therefore,  be reversed.</p>
<p>Attention is called to the decisions of this court in the cases of Aguila <em>vs.</em>  Lazaro (4 Phil. Rep., 735) and Lerma <em>vs.</em> Mamaril (9 Phil. Rep., 119), in which we discussed the provisions of General Orders No. 68.  In said decisions this court  arrived at the  conclusion that under  the  provisions of General Orders No. 68, the marriage of a man over 14 years  of age to a woman over 12 years of age is valid and can  not be declared to be a nullity, because  the  consent of the parents was not obtained.</p>
<p>For the reason that the record contains no evidence that the  said marriage took place without  the  consent of the parents, the sentence of the lower court is hereby reversed the complaint is  ordered to be dismissed and the defendants discharged from the custody of the law,  with costs <em>de oficio.</em></p>
<p><em>Arellano,  C. J., Torres,  Mapa, Carson,  Moreland,</em> and <em>Trent, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
