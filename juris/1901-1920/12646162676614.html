				G.R. No. 1208, August 06, 1903</h4>
				<H3>THE  UNITED STATES, COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE, VS.  JOSE QUEVENGCO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Sotera  Jico was  in the house of  the  defendant for three days.  During that time she was  employed as  a servant therein, had the freedom of the house,  and left it at times to visit her mother, who lived upon the same estate.   At those times she was accompanied only by a small child. These facts do not show the commission  of the crime of <em>detencion ilegal</em>.</p>
<p>She was, by the  servants of the defendant and a soldier of the Constabulary, compelled, against her will, to leave her house and go with them, in company with her aunt, to the defendant's house.   These facts prove  the commission of the crime  of <em>coaccion</em>, punished by article 497 of the Penal Code.</p>
<p>The offense charged in the complaint is <em>detencion ilegal</em>. That crime can not be committed without committing that form of  <em>coaccion</em> which consists in compelling one to do what he does not wish to do.  The latter is  therefore necessarily included  in  the  former, and under this complaint for <em>detencion  ilegal</em> the defendant can  be convicted of  this form of <em>coaccion</em>.   (G.  O., No. 58, sec. 29.)</p>
<p>The aggravating circumstance of sex, mentioned in  No. 20 of article  10 of the Penal  Code,  should be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>The judgment below is reversed and  the defendant is found guilty of the crime of coaccion,  and  is sentenced to six months of <em>arresto mayor</em>, to a fine of 325 pesetas,  and the payment of 25 pesos as indemnity  to said Sotera Jico, and to the payment of costs.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Cooper, Mapa,</em> and <em>McDonough, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
