				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. IGNACIO AZTIGARRAGA (ALIAS SIA SEE SEND) AND LIM TIONG TIM, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.

				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The defendants and appellants were charged in the Court of First Instance of 
the city of Manila with the unlawful importation of 680 grams of morphine. 
Separate trials were had. The defendant Ignacio Aztigarraga alias Sia See Send 
was found guilty by the Honorable George R. Harvey and sentenced to two years' 
imprisonment, to pay a fine of P1,000, or to suffer subsidiary imprisonment in 
case of insolvency, and to pay one-half of the costs. The defendant Lim Tiong 
Tim was found guilty by the Honorable M. V. del Rosario and sentenced to three 
years' imprisonment, to pay a fine of P2,000, or to suffer subsidiary 
imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay one-half of the costs. Both have 
appealed, making various assignments of error.
<p>Through advice of employees of the Bureau of Posts, the secret service of the 
Bureau of Customs received information that contraband was being imported into 
the Philippines through the mails. Thereupon thirty or more suspicious packages 
arrived per Steamship <em>Carmartenshire</em> from Hongkong were distributed 
according to their addresses in various post-office boxes. Secret service agents 
were detailed to observe and apprehend the person or persons calling for the 
packages. A brief narration of what then happened is as follows.</p>
<p>The accused Aztigarraga came twice alone to the post-office, city of Manila, 
during the early evening of July 6, 1916, to reconnoiter. About 9.30 of the same 
evening, Aztigarraga came again accompanied by the other accused Lim Tiong Tim. 
Both examined the ten boxes in which the packages had been deposited. Finding no 
ground for suspicion, Lim Tiong Tim took station at the entrance of the 
post-office, Aztigarraga remaining near the boxes. Lim Tiong Tim gave a sign to 
Aztigarraga, who opened box 1167 and took therefrom three packages of papers 
which were later found to contain morphine. The secret service men at once 
arrested the two defendants and took them into the post-office. Papers in 
Chinese evidencing a code for illicit operations with other parties in Hongkong 
were found in the pocket of Lim Tiong Tim. The key to box 1167 was taken from 
Aztigarraga. At the same time Aztigarraga confessed, although later he claimed 
that the last four words "na meron lamang morfina" (containing morphine) were 
added after he signed and without his consent.</p>
<p>The following morning, July 7, secret service agents visited the rooms 
occupied by the two defendants. Various articles and documents of an 
incriminating nature, including a receipt in Aztigarraga's name for post-office 
box 1167, were found in the room of Aztigarraga.</p>
<p>The purpose of each defendant is plainly to attempt to make out that the 
other is alone responsible. Thus, Aztigarraga claims that Lim Tiong Tim was the 
master and that he, Aztigarraga, was only an innocent agent who had no knowledge 
of the contents of the packages; on the trial of Lim Tiong Tim he went on the 
stand to testify against him. Lim Tiong Tim on the contrary claims that 
Aztigarraga is a deliberate perjurer; that the only evidence against him, Lim 
Tiong Tim, was the fact that he was seen to enter the post-office at the same 
time as Aztigarraga and that there were found in his pockets certain papers in 
Chinese which are some sort of a code; and finally stress is laid on the point 
that various exhibits offered in evidence were found in the possession of 
Aztigarraga. But notwithstanding these efforts to transfer culpability from one 
to the other, it is impossible to escape the conclusion that as found by two 
judges after fair trials both defendants are responsible before the law. Both 
were apprehended during the accomplishment of the criminal act, one as look-out 
who gave a sign to the other, and the other who in response to that sign took 
the packages containing morphine from the post-office box. Aztigarraga 
confessed, and we have no reason to question this confession or the memorandum 
of the witness Scott narrating the statements of Aztigarraga. Both lived 
together, Lim Tiong Tim as master and Aztigarraga as servant, in a house in 
which various incriminating things were found including a receipt for 
post-office box 1167 in the name of Aztigarraga, the servant.</p>
<p>As to the conviction of Aztigarraga, the assignments of error are covered by 
what we have already said. Greatest emphasis by counsel is laid on the point 
that the relation of master and servant existed between Lim Tiong Tim and 
Aztigarraga and that following the doctrine of this court in U. S. <em>vs</em>. 
Chan Guy Juan ([1912], 23 Phil. Rep., 105), the principal who employs an 
innocent agent is liable but not the agent. But that Aztigarraga had knowledge 
that the package contained morphine is shown by his conduct on the night on 
which apprehended, by his admission to the witness Scott, by his voluntary 
confession, and by what was found in his room.</p>
<p>As to the conviction of Lim Tiong Tim it is contended that the court erred in 
admitting the testimony of his co-accused Aztigarraga. (U. S. <em>vs</em>. 
Raymundo [1909], 14 Phil. Rep., 416.) But the proof demonstrates that the acts 
of Aztigarraga were performed in aid or execution of a conspiracy with Lim Tiong 
Tim to violate the Opium Law. In addition, as said, in the recent decision of 
the United States Supreme Court in the case of Valdez <em>vs</em>. V. S. (Sup. 
Ct. of U. S., No. 361, October Term, 1916) the "testimony or confession of an 
accomplice is not to be summarily discarded but to be judged of by confirming or 
opposing circumstances as well as by his character and the influences that may 
invest him." (<em>See also</em> U. S. <em>vs</em>. Soriano [1913], 25 Phil. 
Rep., 624.)</p>
<p>It is contended further that the lower court erred in holding that the three 
packages containing morphine were imported from a foreign country. (U. S. 
<em>vs</em>. Jose [1916], 34 Phil. Rep., 840.) The Steamship 
<em>Carmartenshire</em>, containing mail bags in which these papers arrived, was 
admitted to have come from Hongkong to Manila on July 6, 1916. The code found on 
the person of Lim Tiong Tim shows that he was engaged in the illicit business of 
importing morphine from Hongkong. And, it is a general rule that from its 
post-mark, in this instance Hongkong, the fact that a letter or package was 
mailed from this place may be inferred. (Uhlman <em>vs</em>. Arnholdt &amp; 
Schaefer Brewing Co. [1893], 53 Fed., 485, 489, and other cases.)</p>
<p>It is contended further that the lower court erred in admitting over 
objection of counsel the record in case No. 9578, being a former criminal 
proceeding, in which the defendant Lim Tiong Tim with others was found guilty of 
the illegal importation of opium. Looking to our records to find this case, we 
discover it reported under the caption, U. S. <em>vs</em>. Ah Tung, Hao You Tee, 
and Lim Tiong Tim ([1913], 26 Phil. Rep., 321). There also, somewhat curiously, 
the following assignment of error was made, "The court erred in allowing the 
defendant Lim Tiong Tim to be cross-examined in reference to another criminal 
case in which he had been convicted, and in allowing the introduction in 
evidence of the sentence in that case after the defendant had admitted his prior 
conviction/' In discussing the point, Mr. Justice Carson in part said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We conclude that in this jurisdiction, where all trials in criminal cases 
are had without the aid of a jury, the evidence as to a former conviction is 
properly introduced at the trial of the subsequent charge, and that the trial 
judge must be relied upon to hear all the evidence without being swayed by 
prejudices, which might readily affect a body of jurors less experienced and 
skilled in the administration of justice than he must be presumed to be.</p>
<p>"Of course, in such cases, the best evidence of a prior conviction is a 
certified copy of the original judgment of conviction, and such evidence is 
always admissible and conclusive unless the accused himself denies his identity 
with the person convicted at the former trial."</p></blockquote>
<p>To prove one a recidivist under the Opium Law, it is, therefore, essential 
that the information contain an allegation to this effect and that the record in 
the previous case be introduced in evidence or otherwise proved. The information 
herein charges, "That the accused Lim Tiong Tim is neither a citizen of the 
United States nor of the Philippine Islands and has heretofore once been 
convicted of violation of section 4 of the said Act No. 2381 of the Philippine 
Legislature; hence a recidivist." The record in case No. 9578 shows, it is said, 
that the charge was filed prior to the passage of Act No. 2381. However, the law 
reads "may be deported," and since the lower court did not see fit to order 
deportation we are not inclined to overrule this finding. But the lower court 
was clearly authorized in taking into consideration the prior conviction in 
arriving at a decision as to the proper penalty.</p>
<p>Having considered the important assignments of error and having found no 
basis which, from any aspect of the case, would justify us in interfering with 
the findings of the trial courts, and the sentences imposed by the two trial 
judges being within their discretion and in accordance with law, it results that 
the two judgments must be affirmed with proportionate costs of this instance 
against each of the appellants. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Araullo</em>, and <em>Street, JJ</em>., concur. </p>
<p><em>Carson, J</em>., concurs in the result.</p>
<p><em>Johnson, J</em>., did not take part. </p>

<p align="center"><strong>DECISION ON MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION.</strong></p>
<p>MALCOLM, J.:</p>
<p>This is a petition for rehearing and reconsideration. Ordinarily, it is the 
practice to deny such motions without opinion. The obvious reasons are that a 
court cannot permit itself to enter into a joint debate with counsel for the 
losing side who is naturally supercritical, and that a court cannot permit 
litigation to stretch out to infinity. As herein counsel assumes the attitude of 
one who has not received sufficient consideration of the points advanced in his 
admirable brief, a word of explanation may be permitted.</p>
<p>Ground 1. "The trial court erred in admitting in evidence Exhibit H—being 
thirty one newspaper packages, most of them containing morphine—which packages 
were never withdrawn from the post office, and with which the accused was not 
shown to have any connection whatsoever."</p>
<p>Answer. Exhibit H was not considered in arriving at the judgment of this 
court. It was therefore unnecessary to consider this assignment of error.</p>
<p>Ground 2. "It was alleged as error that the prosecution failed to show that 
Exhibits A-1, A-2 and A-3, the newspapers extracted from P. 0. Box 1167, 
contained any morphine when offered in evidence. The corpus delicti was not 
established in that positive manner requited by the decision."</p>
<p>Answer. The decision reads: "Lim Tiong Tim gave a sign to Aztigarraga, who 
opened box 1167 and took therefrom three packages of papers which were later 
found to contain morphine." In the record, p. 260, is found this statement: "El 
acusado admite que el contenido de los paquetes Exhibits A-1 a1 A-3 y el Exhibit 
H es morfina en la cantidad alegada en la querella." (The accused admits that 
the contents of the packages Exhibits A-1 to A-3 and Exhibit H is morphine in 
the amount stated in the information.)</p>
<p>Ground 3. "Attention is also invited to the fact that this Honorable Court, 
by its decision, brands the testimony of Aztigarraga as false in all that 
respects his own defense, and holds it to be true in that part where he 
implicates this defendant. We do not believe the testimony of such a witness a 
sufficient basis to send a man to prison for three years, with subsidiary 
imprisonment in the amount of P2,000 fine.</p>
<p>"Stress is laid upon the fact that a secret cable code was found in the 
pocket of this defendant, evidently relating to the importing of opium or 
morphine from Hong Kong. There is absolutely nothing of record showing any 
connection between such cable code and the charge here in question. That it had 
such connection is an 'inference' which should not be drawn under established 
rules of criminal jurisprudence.</p>
<p>"That this Honorable Court has treated and considered such two cases and the 
two appeals as one case and one appeal and has rendered but one decision as 
against both defendants. That this is error, and a deprivation of the rights 
accorded this defendant by law."</p>
<p>Answer. These statements present a mere difference of opinion. The judgment 
of the Supreme Court affirms the two judgments appealed from.</p>
<p>GROUND 4. "As stated by the Supreme Court of the United States in Clyatt 
<em>vs</em>. United States (197 U. S., 207, 222).</p>
<p>" 'Only in the exact administration of the law will justice in the long run 
be done, and the confidence of the public in such administration be maintained.' 
"</p>
<p>Answer. This quotation appears in many briefs filed in this court. It is in 
the nature of a maxim which all should remember. "The exact administration of 
the law" demands, among other things, the conviction of those proved guilty of a 
violation of the criminal law, without hesitation, without quibbling over minor 
points which merely serve to becloud the main issue, and without unnecessary 
delay.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Carson, Araullo</em>, and <em>Street, JJ</em>., 
concur.</p>
<p><em>Johnson, J</em>., did not take part.</p></div>
