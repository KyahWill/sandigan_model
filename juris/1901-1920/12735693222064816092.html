				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Sprungli &amp; Co. (consisting of Albert K. Sprungli, Emilio H. Sprungli and Otto Gmur), a duly registered mercantile partnership,&nbsp; commenced business in March,&nbsp; 1911, taking over the assets and liabilities of the old firm of Sprungli &amp; Co. which had been dissolved by the death of&nbsp; the senior partner who was the father of&nbsp; the above-named Sprunglis. Gmur was also a partner in the old firm.&nbsp; The partnership capital of the new firm was fixed at P200,000,&nbsp; of which Gmur undertook to contribute P40,000 and the two Sprunglis P160,000.&nbsp; The partnership was to last&nbsp; five years, and all the partners were designated as managers.&nbsp; On June 10,&nbsp; 1912, the three partners executed Exhibit B, a public notarial&nbsp; document, which&nbsp; provided,&nbsp; among other&nbsp; things, that the firm should be dissolved on March 31, 1913, and that, in&nbsp; the&nbsp; meantime, the managing&nbsp; partner&nbsp; should be Gmur.&nbsp; On March 31,&nbsp; 1913, the three partners executed another&nbsp; notarial document&nbsp; whereby the contract of June 10,&nbsp; 1912, was amended by postponing the date of dissolution until May 31, 1913.&nbsp; On the latter date C.&nbsp; F.&nbsp; Arbenz took over the management of&nbsp; the firm from Gmur.&nbsp; On June 2,&nbsp; 1913, Arbenz&nbsp; was appointed liquidator of the partnership,&nbsp; with a view to closing up its affairs, and&nbsp; instituted this action on the 27th of that month for the purpose, as it is alleged, of recovering certain assets of&nbsp; the firm which were necessary&nbsp; for the payment of&nbsp; the firm's&nbsp; debts and which the defendant&nbsp; was&nbsp; withholding and appropriating to his own use and&nbsp; benefit.&nbsp; Judgment&nbsp; was rendered&nbsp; in favor of the plaintiff&nbsp; and the defendant has appealed. In the contract of June&nbsp; 10, 1912&nbsp; (Exhibit B), it was stipulated that: "Secondly: That the party of the second part [Gmur] hereby&nbsp; agrees to sell, assign and deliver&nbsp; to the parties of the first part [the Sprunglis] all his right, title and interest&nbsp; in&nbsp; and to said partnership of Sprungli &amp; Co. at the expiration of the term of his management&nbsp; of the said Sprungli &amp; Co. [March 31, 1913], in consideration whereof the said parties of&nbsp; the first part&nbsp; agree to buy and take over, on the date aforementioned, or as soon thereafter as the interest of said party of the second part in the firm of Sprungli &amp; Co. can be determined, all right, title and interest of the said party of the second&nbsp; part in the firm of Sprungli &amp;&nbsp; Co., the said interest of&nbsp; the party of the second&nbsp; [part] to be ascertained from and based upon the usual balance sheet of Sprungli&nbsp; &amp; Co. to be prepared on March 31, 1913.<br><br><blockquote>"The said parties of the first part&nbsp; further agree to pay the said party&nbsp; of the second part twenty thousand&nbsp; pesos (P20,000)&nbsp; Philippine currency,&nbsp; over&nbsp; and above his interest in the firm of Sprungli &amp; Co. as shown by said balance sheet of March 31, 1913, by way [of] indemnity and&nbsp; in their consideration for early relinquishment of the&nbsp; said partnership interest of said party of the second part.<br><br>"Thirdly: For the&nbsp; purpose&nbsp; of finally settling the&nbsp; value of the 'Geo. Y.&nbsp; Taylor' machine shop business, hereinafter referred to, it is hereby agreed that it, with all the property and rights appurtenant&nbsp; thereto, shall have a&nbsp; fixed Value of seventy thousand pesos&nbsp; (P70,000) and that should the balance sheet of March 31, 1913, show the party of the second part to have an interest in the business of Sprungli &amp; Co. exceeding that value, then the parties of the&nbsp; first part will, in addition to&nbsp; said seventy thousand, pay him the difference between said seventy thousand&nbsp; pesos and the value of his interest as shown by said balance sheet, plus the&nbsp; indemnity&nbsp; hereinabove mentioned.&nbsp; Should his said interest and the indemnity&nbsp; be less than said seventy thousand pesos then the party&nbsp; of the second part will pay the resulting difference to the&nbsp; parties of the first part.<br><br>"Thirdly: In&nbsp; order to secure&nbsp; the performance of the conditions&nbsp; specified&nbsp; in paragraph&nbsp; marked 'secondly' the parties of the first part will immediately assign and transfer, by way of (<i>pacto de retro</i>), to the party of the second part all their respective interest in the said machine shop business known&nbsp; as 'Geo.&nbsp; Y.&nbsp; Taylor,&nbsp; Machinist and Engineer'&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *.&nbsp;&nbsp; Should payment of the second party, for his interest as aforesaid, not be made however during the three&nbsp; months immediately following March 31, 1913, said conveyance shall become absolute and the partnership existing under the name of Sprungli &amp; Co. <i>ipso facto</i> dissolved, *****</blockquote><br>In the contract of August 30, 1912 (Exhibit C), it was provided that: "2. The above properties and business (the Geo. Y. Taylor machine shops), described in the preceding subdivisions of paragraph one, are hereby transferred, sold and delivered to&nbsp; the said party&nbsp; of the second part (Gmur), <i> together with all burdens, obligations, and liabilities&nbsp; of whatsoever nature</i> standing against same on the 10th day of June, 1912, and it is hereby provided that&nbsp; the title in and to the said properties shall&nbsp; be construed to&nbsp; have vested in the said party of the second part since and as of the date of the 10th day&nbsp; of June,&nbsp; 1912.<br><br><blockquote>&nbsp; "3.&nbsp; To have and to hold all and singular the said&nbsp; premises and business, together with the appurtenances thereto belonging,&nbsp; unto&nbsp; the said&nbsp; party of&nbsp; the second part, his heirs, administrators and assigns foreverâ€”upon the following condition: That should party of the first part or either or both of&nbsp; the&nbsp; above mentioned A.&nbsp; K. Sprungli and&nbsp; H. Emilio Sprungli pay to the said party&nbsp; of&nbsp; the second part the value of his interest in Sprungli &amp; Co. as the same may be ascertained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph two of the contract of&nbsp; June 10, 1912,&nbsp; (a copy of which is hereto attached) plus&nbsp; the sum of twenty thousand pesos (P20,000) being the indemnity also&nbsp; provided&nbsp; for in said paragraph two of said contract of June 10th, 1912, on or [before]&nbsp; the 30th day of June, 1913, then and in that event the said party of the second part will&nbsp; immediately reconvey&nbsp; and&nbsp; deliver&nbsp; to&nbsp; the said person, or persons, so paying the said sum as above provided, all of that business, property leasehold rights&nbsp; described in paragraph one, subdivisions a, b and c, of this indenture.<br><br>"4. The said party of the second part&nbsp; hereby accepts the sale, transfer&nbsp; and&nbsp; delivery of the above described properties, together&nbsp; with&nbsp; the obligations thereinbefore mentioned under the terms herein set forth." </blockquote><br>The record fails&nbsp; to&nbsp; disclose whether or not&nbsp; there was a liquidation of&nbsp; the old&nbsp; firm's debts at the time of&nbsp; the reorganization&nbsp; or whether&nbsp; the property in question was a part of the assets of the old firm, but it is admitted that this property was a part&nbsp; of the assets of the new firm.<br><br>We will now inquire whether the defendant&nbsp; acquired, by virtue of the above-quoted provisions of&nbsp; the&nbsp; contracts, title to the property in question and is therefore entitled to retain possession of the same against&nbsp; the plaintiff as liquidator, who claims that this&nbsp; property is necessary for the due liquidation of the firm's debts.<br><br>The liquidator and&nbsp; interveners insist (1) that the attempted sale by the two&nbsp; Sprunglis of the Geo. Y. Taylor machine shops to the&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; conveyed to the&nbsp; latter no title to this property for the reason&nbsp; that such sale lacked one of the three essential&nbsp; elements, namely, a fixed price or consideration;&nbsp; (2) that assuming&nbsp; that the sale was valid, the defendant acquired only such interest as the two Sprunglis had&nbsp; in the property and no more; and (3) that&nbsp; under the law no partner is entitled to specify&nbsp; partnership property, nor&nbsp; has he any&nbsp; separate interest in such property, until after the dissolution of the firm and the payment of all its liabilities.&nbsp; While on the&nbsp; other hand, the defendant urges that the sale in question&nbsp; must be considered solely as an interpartnership&nbsp; transaction and therefore&nbsp; valid because all the partners of a firm of this character may agree to the retirement of one of the partners and the payment to him of his&nbsp; interest in the partnership property&nbsp; by the transfer to him of specific assets belonging to the&nbsp; firm.<br><br>The instrument of June 10, 1912, and August 30, 1912, must be considered together, since each is supplementary to the other.&nbsp; In that of June 10th, the Sprunglis agreed to buy and Gmur agreed&nbsp; to sell all of the latter's interest in the firm of Sprungli &amp; Co., "said&nbsp; interest of the party of the second part to be ascertained from and based upon the balance sheet of Sprungli &amp; Co., to be prepared on March 31,&nbsp; 1913."&nbsp; It was further agreed&nbsp; that "in order to secure the performance of this&nbsp; agreement" the Sprunglis would immediately assign and transfer by way of <i>pacto de retro</i> to Gmur all of their respective interests in the property in question.&nbsp; According to the terms of the contract of August 30th, the property was sold transferred, and delivered on that day to Gmur for&nbsp; and in consideration of the latter's Interest in the&nbsp; firm of Sprungli &amp;&nbsp; Co., "the same to be ascertained in accordance with the&nbsp; provisions of paragraph 2 of the contract of June 10, 1912."&nbsp; This sale and transfer were made&nbsp; subject to the right of&nbsp; repurchase&nbsp; by the Sprunglis, or either of them, on or before June&nbsp; 30, 1913, and the sale and transfer were so accepted, "together with all&nbsp; burdens, obligations,&nbsp; and liabilities&nbsp; of&nbsp; whatsoever nature standing against the same (property) on the 10th day of&nbsp; June, 1912."&nbsp; The&nbsp; results is that the adjustment of Gmur's interest in the firm was to be determined by&nbsp; and based upon the balance sheet of March 31, 1913.&nbsp; If&nbsp; this balance sheet should show that Gmur's interest exceeded P90,000 (P70,000 for&nbsp; the machine shops and P20,000 as bonus&nbsp; for his premature retirement&nbsp; from the firm), the Sprunglis were to immediately pay the excess.&nbsp; If it should go&nbsp; below that amount, Gmur agreed to refund the difference.&nbsp; Although Gmur was to&nbsp; retire&nbsp; from the firm&nbsp; on March 31,&nbsp; 1913, he&nbsp; continued as&nbsp; manager until May 31, of that year, the date finally fixed for the dissolution of the firm.&nbsp; It was on this date that the&nbsp; plaintiff took over the management, he being&nbsp; appointed liquidator two&nbsp; days later.&nbsp; Before&nbsp; being&nbsp; relieved as&nbsp; manager,&nbsp; Gmur caused to be prepared a balance sheet, showing, as he claims, the correct status of the affairs of the firm of Sprungli &amp; Co. on March 31, 1913.&nbsp; Gmur's interest was fixed therein at P74,000.&nbsp; The Sprunglis&nbsp; and interveners&nbsp; did not participate in&nbsp; the&nbsp; preparation of this balance sheet or approve of it after it had been prepared.&nbsp;&nbsp; The plaintiff immediately upon taking charge examined Gmur's balance sheet and compared it with the actual status of the affairs of the firm and&nbsp; found that it was not correct because&nbsp; the firm was wholly insolvent on March 31st,&nbsp; and had been for "many months" prior to that time.&nbsp; The trial court reached the same conclusion upon&nbsp; this branch of the case.&nbsp;&nbsp; This conclusion or finding of fact is certainly not against the weight of the evidence.<br><br>The transfer of the property in question,&nbsp; which&nbsp; was a part of the firm's assets, was not made to Gmur as a creditor.&nbsp;&nbsp; The firm owed him nothing.&nbsp; He had&nbsp; not furnished it with any materials&nbsp; or&nbsp; supplies or loaned&nbsp; it any money for the purpose of carrying on its business.&nbsp;&nbsp; He had contributed nothing to the firm, in&nbsp; so&nbsp; far as&nbsp; the questions under consideration are concerned, except his&nbsp; capital, which constituted&nbsp; his interest, and it&nbsp; was&nbsp; in payment of this interest&nbsp; that the transfer was&nbsp; made.&nbsp; Undoubtedly, the three partners could agree as they pleased about their joint property and all the parts of it;&nbsp; and so they could&nbsp; about their joint obligations,&nbsp; And all such agreements are&nbsp; valid, so far as they do not&nbsp; affect the right of creditors.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, the three partners could&nbsp; agree to dissolve, and divide all the property&nbsp; in&nbsp; a certain way, specifying that one shall have this, another that, and the&nbsp; third that thing, or they could&nbsp; make such an&nbsp; agreement about some&nbsp; one or&nbsp; more things, and not about&nbsp; all.&nbsp; All such agreements&nbsp; would determine&nbsp; their&nbsp; property rights in&nbsp; these things effectively as to the partners&nbsp; themselves.&nbsp; But&nbsp; all the&nbsp; assets of this insolvent firm&nbsp; are just as&nbsp; liable for the debts of the firm, after such division or settlement&nbsp; among partners, as they were before.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Parsons on Partnership, p. 385.)<br><br>Sprungli &amp; Co. was a purely private partnership.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was not given the right of eminent domain and it owed no special duties to the public.&nbsp; If it had been&nbsp; solvent, there would be no&nbsp; reason to disturb or question the transfer&nbsp; of the machine&nbsp; shops to&nbsp; Gmur.&nbsp; But the moment it became insolvent&nbsp; (and this&nbsp; occurred prior&nbsp; to Gmur's retirement from the&nbsp; firm as a partner), the three&nbsp; partners became trustees for the creditors and it was their duty to manage the firm's property and assets with strict regard to the interests of the creditors.&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither partner, as long as&nbsp; this condition of&nbsp; affairs exist, will be permitted to secure his original capital by purchasing and taking possession of the firm's property or assets.&nbsp; He may, however, in good faith and for an adequate consideration purchase the&nbsp; property of an insolvent firm, but this consideration must not be his interest in the insolvent concern.&nbsp; He must&nbsp; pay&nbsp; the partnership for the benefit of the creditors&nbsp; the real&nbsp; value&nbsp; of such property.&nbsp; (Mead <i>vs.</i> McCullough, 21 Phil. Rep., 95.) This Gmur did not do.<br><br>But counsel for the defendant urges that the interveners cannot interfere in this action to set&nbsp; aside a transfer of the property made on August 30, 1912,&nbsp; over a&nbsp; year&nbsp; after the transaction;&nbsp; that&nbsp; to warrant such&nbsp; interference&nbsp;&nbsp; on their part, they should have alleged and proven that their credits&nbsp; were given while the machine shops were the&nbsp; property of Sprungli &amp; Co.; that they relied upon that fact to their damage; and that it is not sufficient&nbsp; to allege that the firm owed them the amount set forth on May&nbsp; 31, 1913, in order to set aside a deed dated August 30, 1912.&nbsp; Counsel further insist that the only possible theory that would permit third persons to intervene in&nbsp; interpartnership matters such as this is&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; third&nbsp; party&nbsp; extended&nbsp; credit,&nbsp; believing the partnership to have had certain assets which it&nbsp; later turned out it did not&nbsp; have, and that in the case at&nbsp; bar none of the interveners can claim this for the reason that the record shows that the local banks all had knowledge of the intended transfer and of&nbsp; the&nbsp; actual transfer of the Taylor&nbsp; machine business to Gmur.&nbsp; They&nbsp; took&nbsp; an active part in these&nbsp; transactions and caused Gmur to remain responsible as a partner for almost a year after the&nbsp; sale.<br><br>Here counsel seems to lose sight of the facts that the validity of the sale and transfer&nbsp; of the machine shops to Gmur&nbsp; depended upon the latter's&nbsp; interest&nbsp; in the&nbsp; firm of Sprungli &amp; Co. on March 31, 1913, and that such&nbsp; interest on that date amounted to nothing.&nbsp; According to the contention of counsel, we have one of the partners attempting to buy&nbsp; from&nbsp; the other two partners on August 30,&nbsp; 1912, certain assets of the&nbsp; partnership&nbsp; for and in consideration of his&nbsp; interest in the firm on March 31, 1913, this&nbsp; same partner continuing not only&nbsp; as a&nbsp; partner but as the&nbsp; manager, and so managing the firm during this time that it was wholly&nbsp; insolvent&nbsp; on the date when the consideration for the sale was to be fixed.&nbsp; Assuming that the interveners, as creditors, knew of these interpartner transactions, they also knew, when&nbsp; they extended credits, that such transactions depended solely upon Gmur's interest on&nbsp; March 31, 1913.&nbsp; These&nbsp; credits&nbsp; must have&nbsp; been extended at the instance&nbsp; of the manager, Gmur.&nbsp; To allow Gmur to secure his original capital by taking over a part of the&nbsp; firm's assets in this manner would not be in accordance with the principles of justice and&nbsp; equity which should govern him while holding a position of&nbsp; trust.<br><br>To hold that the title to the machine shops, which&nbsp; were a part of the&nbsp; firm's assets, vested in Gmur on August 30, 1912, would have the effect of placing Gmur's private&nbsp; creditors in a better position than the creditors of the&nbsp; firm, as the former could immediately proceed to satisfy their&nbsp; credits by&nbsp; moving against the machine shops, while the latter could not move against the private property of the&nbsp; individual partners until after the firm's assets had been exhausted.<br><br>In the decision of the supreme court&nbsp; of Spain, dated December 19 [29], 1870, the court said: "In the case of the failure of an association the private creditors of the members are not included among&nbsp; those of the association, but after the latter have been satisfied, the former may make use of their right against the residue due the debtor member."<br><br>Again, in the decision of the same court, dated July 12, 1883, it was&nbsp; held that the property of an&nbsp; association&nbsp; is liable in the first place for the&nbsp; debts of the same, and the creditors of the&nbsp; members&nbsp; may&nbsp; only&nbsp; collect the interest of the latter after the&nbsp; definite&nbsp; liquidation&nbsp; with&nbsp; relation to them has taken place.&nbsp;&nbsp; And finally, article 235 of the Code of Commerce provides that:&nbsp; "No member can demand the delivery to him of the capital due him from the common funds until all the debts and obligations of the association have&nbsp; been extinguished, or until the amount thereof has been deposited, if the delivery can not at once take place."<br><br>For the foregoing reasons we conclude that the property in question must be returned to the liquidator for the purpose of&nbsp; paying the insolvent&nbsp; firm's debts.&nbsp; The judgment is therefore affirmed, with costs against the appellant.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson,</i> and <i>Araullo, JJ.,</i> concur.<br></div>
