				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This was a petition for the writ of <em>habeas corpus</em> presented in the 
Court of First Instance of the city of Manila. The writ was denied and the 
plaintiff appealed to this Court.
<p>From the record it appears that on the 18th day of September, 1916, four 
Chinese boys, Tan Un, Tan Tek, Tan Lay, and Tan Bo, of the ages of 19, 12, 17, 
and 15 years respectively, arrived at the port of Manila on the steamship 
<em>Taisang</em>, and, pretending to be the sons of a resident Chinese merchant 
of the Philippine Islands, asked permission to enter the Philippine Islands as 
such children. The question of their right to enter was submitted to a board of 
special inquiry which; after hearing the evidence presented, reached the 
conclusion that the said children were not the legitimate minor sons of Tan Puy 
(said resident Chinese merchant) as claimed, but that they were Chinese persons, 
subjects of the Republic of China, and did not present the section six 
certificate as provided for by law, and, therefore, denied them the right to 
enter. From that conclusion of the board of special inquiry an appeal was had to 
the Insular Collector of Customs, who, after reviewing the evidence adduced 
before said board, reversed the decision of the board and found that the said 
Tan Lay and Tan Bo were the legitimate children of Tan Puy, a resident Chinese 
merchant of the Philippine Islands, and admitted them; but confirmed the 
decision of the board of special inquiry denying the admission of the said Tan 
Un and Tan Tek. Later, the present petition for the writ of <em>habeas 
corpus</em> was presented in the Court of First Instance, where the record made 
before the board of special inquiry was presented as proof on the hearing upon 
said petition. After a consideration of said record and after hearing the 
respective parties, the Honorable George R. Harvey, in a very carefully prepared 
opinion, denied the petition for the writ of <em>habeas corpus</em> upon the 
ground that there had been no abuse of authority on the part of the department 
of customs and ordered the said Tan Tek and Tan Un to be remanded to the custody 
of the Insular Collector of Customs, with costs. From that judgment the 
plaintiff appealed to this court.</p>
<p>The appellant alleged that the lower court committed an error in not finding 
that the Insular Collector of Customs, as well as the board of special inquiry, 
had abused the discretion, power, and authority in them reposed. The lower court 
expressly found that there had been no abuse of authority. While much of the 
proof adduced before the board of special inquiry tends to show that the 
applicants are the legitimate minor children of the petitioner, Tan Puy, the 
board of special inquiry did not believe the witnesses. The board of special 
inquiry had the applicants before it and considered their personal appearance in 
connection with the testimony in passing upon the question of the credibility of 
the witnesses. It has been repeatedly held that the immigration officials are 
not required to accept, as true, statements made to them by applicants for 
admission into the territory of the United States, nor the witnesses presented 
in their behalf, even though such testimony should be given under oath. (Chin 
Yow <em>vs</em>. United States, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep., 201; Jao Igco <em>vs</em>. 
Shuster, 10 Phil. Rep., 448.)</p>
<p>Of course, if the record shows that the witnesses were disbelieved 
arbitrarily and capriciously and without just cause or reason, then the court 
might be justified in reviewing the evidence for the purpose of ascertaining 
whether such arbitrary and capricious acts were an abuse of authority. But the 
courts are not permitted to reverse the judgment of the department of customs 
merely because the courts might have reached a different conclusion from the 
evidence adduced. (Chin Sing Quon <em>vs</em>. United States, 231 Fed. Rep., 
948.)</p>
<p>An examination of the evidence in the present case shows many contradictory 
statements of the witnesses presented concerning facts which, if they had been 
the persons whom they claimed themselves to be, should not have been made. For 
example, one of the witnesses declared that the four brothers left their home 
town in China together, when they went to Amoy for the purpose of coming to 
Manila, accompanied by one called Kiam, while another states that the person who 
accompanied them was called Chok. A further contradiction appears in the fact 
that one of the brothers testified that they all went together from their home 
town to Amoy, while another of the brothers stated that one of them was left 
behind. The said Tan Un declared that he did not go to Amoy with the other 
brothers. A further conflict appears in the fact that one of the brothers 
testified that Tan Bo quit attending school immediately before they started from 
their home town to Amoy, while Tan Bo himself testified that he quit attending 
school three years before they started for Manila. The board of special inquiry, 
from a personal inspection of the said Tan Un made the statement that "his 
personal appearance was that of a laborer; that his hands are hard and calloused 
and he appears to have been working in the fields."</p>
<p>In view of the conflicts and contradictions in the testimony, the officials 
of the department of customs were entirely justified in their conclusions that 
they did not believe the declaration of the witnesses. There is nothing in the 
record that shows that their conclusions were arbitrary or capricious. If there 
is some evidence in the record to support the conclusion of the department of 
customs the court will not modify said conclusion. (Tan Chin Hin <em>vs.</em> 
Collector of Customs, 27 Phil. Rep., 521.)</p>
<p>The customs authorities act more or less as a jury in determining the facts 
in the first instance; they have an opportunity to see the witnesses, and they 
are under no obligation to believe the declaration of a witness if his manner or 
conduct during the examination is such as to cause the authorities to disbelieve 
him, even though his declarations are not disproved by any other witness. (Tan 
Chin Hin <em>vs</em>. Collector of Customs, <em>supra</em>.)</p>
<p>A mere refusal by the proper authorities to allow an alien to enter the 
territory of the United States is not an abuse of authority. The law imposes 
upon the customs authorities the duty to examine into the right of alien 
applicants to enter the territory of the United States. They are required to 
hear the testimony and to decide upon the same, and to determine whether or not 
the applicant is entitled to enter. The authority to examine into the facts 
relating to the right of the applicant to enter the territory of the United 
States implies the discretion to decide upon the evidence, and unless it is 
clearly proved that such discretion and power is abused,the courts will refuse 
to take jurisdiction for the purpose of determining the question of the right of 
the alien to enter. (Tan Chin Hin <em>vs</em>. Collector of Customs,<em> 
supra</em>.)</p>
<p>The mere refusal to permit an alien to enter the territory of the United 
States is not, of itself, an error. The burden of proof is upon the alien who 
seeks admission into the territory of the United States. If there is some 
evidence supporting the conclusion of the department of customs, the courts will 
not modify the same.</p>
<p>There having been no abuse of power or discretion on the part of the 
department of customs, the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed, with 
costs. So ordered.</p>
