				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The plaintiff in this action seeks to recover the sum  of $437.50, United States currency, balance due on a contract for the sawing of  lumber for the lumber yard of Lo-Chim- Lim.   The contract relating to the said work was entered into by the  said Lo-Chim-Lim, acting as in  his own name with the plaintiff,  and it appears that the said Lo-Ohnn-Lim personally agreed to pay for the  work himself.  The plaintiff, however, has brought this action against Lo-Chim-Lim and his codefendants jointly, alleging that, at the time the contract was made, they were the joint proprietors and operators of the said lumber yard engaged in the purchase and sale  of lumber  under  the name  and  style of Lo-Chim-Lim.   Apparently the plaintiff tries to show by the words above italicized that the other defendants were the partners of  Lo-Chim-Lim in the said lumber-yard business.</p>
<p>The court below dismissed the action as to the defendants D.  M. Carman and Fulgeneio Tan-Tongeo  on the ground that  they were not  the partners of  Lo-Chim-Lim, and rendered judgment against the other defendants for the amount claimed in the complaint with the costs of proceedings,   Vicente Palanca and  Go-Tauco only excepted  to the said judgment, moved for a new trial, and have brought the case to this court by bill of exceptions.</p>
<p>The evidence of record shows, according to the judgment of the court below, "That Lo-Chim-Lim had a certain lumber yard in  Calle Lemery of the" city of Manila, and that he was the manager of the same, having ordered the plaintiff to do some work for him at his sawmill in the city of Manila;  and that Vicente Palanca was his partner, and had an interest in the said business as well as in  the profits and losses thereof  *  *  *," and that Go-Tauco received part of the earnings of the lumber yard in the management of which he  was interested.</p>
<p>The court below accordingly found  that "Lo-Chim-Lim Vicente Palanca, and Go-Tauco  had  a lumber yard  in Calle Lemery of the city of Manila in the year 1904, and participated in the profits and losses  of the business and that Lo-Chim-Lim was the managing  partner of the said lumber yard."  In other words, that the appellants were, according to the court below,  coparticipants with the said Lo-Chim-Lim in the business in question.</p>
<p>Although  the evidence upon this point as stated by the court below  is not entirely satisfactory, it can not be said&gt; however, that it is plainly and manifestly in conflict with the above finding of that court.   Such finding should therefore be sustained.</p>
<p>The question thus raised is, therefore, purely one of law and reduces itself to determining the real legal nature  of the participation which the appellants had in Lo-Chim-Lim's lumber yard, and consequently their liability toward the plaintiff,  in connection with the  transaction which gave rise to  the present suit.</p>
<p>It seems that the alleged partnership between Lo-Chim-Lim and the appellants was formed  by verbal agreement only.  At least there is no evidence tending to show that said agreement was reduced to writing, or that it was ever recorded in a public instrument.</p>
<p>Moreover, that partnership had no corporate name.  The plaintiff himself alleges in his complaint  that the partnership was engaged in business under the name and style of Lo-Chim-Lim only, which according to the evidence was the name of one of the defendants.  On  the other hand, and this is very important, it does not appear that there was any mutual agreement between the parties, and if there were any,  it has not been shown what that agreement was. As far as the evidence shows it seems that the business was conducted by Lo-Chim-Lim in  his own  name, although  he gave to the  appellants a share of the  earnings  of the business; but what that share was has not been shown with certainty.   The contracts  made with  the plaintiff  were made by Lo-Chim-Lim individually in his own name, and there is no evidence that the partnership ever contracted in any other form.   Under such circumstances we find nothing upon Avhich to consider this partnership other than as a partnership of cuentas en partioipavidn.  It may  be that, as a matter of fact, it is something different, but the uncertain  and scant  evidence introduced by the parties does not permit of any other designation of  this partnership.   We see nothing, according to the evidence, but a simple business conducted by Lo-Chim-Lim exclusively,  in his own name, and under  his own personal management, he having effected every transaction  connected therewith also in his own name, the  names of the other persons interested in the profits and losses of the business nowhere appearing.   A partnership constituted  in such a  manner, the existence of which was only known to those who had an interest in the same, there being no mutual agreements between the partners, and without a corporate  name indicating to the public in some way that there $vere other people besides the one who ostensibly  managed and conducted the business, is exactly the accidental partnership of cuentas en participacion defined  in article  239 of the Code of Commerce.</p>
<p>Those who contract with the person under whose name the business of such partnership of  cuentas en participacion is conducted, shall have only a right of action against such  person and not against the other persons interested, and the  latter, on  the other hand, shall  have no right of action against the third person who contracted with the manage1!1 unless such manager  formally transfers his right to them.   (Art. 242 of the Code of Commerce.)   It follows, therefore, that the plaintiff has no right to demand from tlie appellants the payment of the amount claimed in the complaint, as  Lo-Chim-Lim wan the only one who contracted with him.  The action  of the plaintiff lacks,  therefore,  a  legal   foundation  and  should   be accordingly dismissed.</p>
<p>The judgment  appealed from is hereby reversed and the appellants are absolved of the complaint  without  express provision as to the costs of both instances.  After the expiration  of twenty days let judgment be entered in accordance  herewith, and ten days  thereafter the cause be remanded to the court  below for execution.  So ordered.</p>
