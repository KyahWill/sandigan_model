				<BR><STRONG>MORELAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">These are applications for writs of habeas corpus.
<p>The petitioners herein are detained under a commitment issued upon a final 
judgment1 of the Court of First Instance of Manila convicting" them on a new 
trial, following an appeal from the municipal court of said city, of a violation 
of section 3 of Ordinance No. 152, and sentencing each one of them to pay P100 
fine, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of nonpayment.</p>
<p>Section 3 of said ordinance reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 3. <em>Visiting places where opium is smoked or dealt in 
prohibited.</em>—No person shall visit or be present at or in any place where 
opium, or any of its derivatives or compounds, is smoked or otherwise used in or 
upon the human body, or unlawfully sold, given away, or otherwise disposed 
of."</p></blockquote>
<p>Petitioners allege that the judgments of conviction are null and void and 
state the reasons therefor as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>" (1) That there is no evidence to support said judgment.</p>
<p>"(2) That the trial court in its findings as set out in the copy of the 
decision of said court hereunto attached and made a part hereof and marked 
Exhibit A, finds that it was not shown that petitioners or any of them were 
guilty of a violation of said Ordinance No. 152."</p></blockquote>
<p>The decision of the court referred to is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This action arises on an information presented against the accused for a 
violation of Ordinance No. 152, already tried and determined in the municipal 
court, wherein the accused were found guilty as charged and sentenced, each one, 
to pay a fine of P100, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, in 
accordance with the law. The case is before this court for a new trial upon 
appeal from that judgment.</p>
<p>"During the trial Sergeant Worrel and Patrolman Peñalosa testified as 
witnesses. From their testimony it appears that in a house known as No. 363 
Calle Ilang-ilang, in one of the living rooms thereof, there were found upon a 
bed certain utensils used in the smoking of opium, namely, a pipe, a lamp and 
three small packages, two of them empty and one containing a quantity of opium. 
They also testified that when they entered the room there was a strong odor of 
opium fumes and that the opium pipe found upon the bed was still warm.</p>
<p>"With respect to the evidence of the accused, their testimony establishes the 
entry of the house by the police and the arrest, but they avoided answering 
questions relative to the utensils that were found in the room, as to who was 
the person who was smoking opium there that night, as well as the designation of 
what person was occupying the room and bed on that night.</p>
<p>"There is no proof whatever, on the other hand, that the house, which was a 
Chinese club, was a place destined or habitually used for the smoking of opium, 
for if it had been other utensils for the smoking of the drug would have been 
found; and there not having been found more than those shown to the court, it 
may not be asserted that said house was destined or habitually used as a place 
for the smoking of opium.</p>
<p>"The defense in discussing the presence of the accused in the house 
maintained that they were not there as visitors but that they lived there. Four 
of the accused, Chua Eng Cheng, Chen Po, Uy Ching, and Ngo Tiao, were employees 
of the club, the first being the clerk, the second the cashier, the third the 
collector, and the fourth the cook. The other, Sec Hong, was a transient who had 
arrived from Tacloban three weeks before and was a guest at the club.</p>
<p>"It is not necessary to discuss the relations which the accused bore to the 
club on that night. The fact is sufficient that all of them were caught on that 
occasion in said house and that in said house opium was being smoked at that 
time. This is sufficient to establish a violation of Ordinance No. 152, article 
3, if it is clear to the court that opium was being smoked there in that house 
at that time and that the accused were there present.</p>
<p>"Wherefore the court declares the said accused guilty of a violation of 
Ordinance No. 152, article 3, and affirms the judgment of the municipal court 
sentencing each one of them to pay a fine of P100 and to suffer the 
corresponding subsidiary imprisonment in case of nonpayment as provided by 
law."</p></blockquote>
<p>The petitioners contend that, the Supreme Court having already held in the 
case of United States<em> vs.</em> Ten Yu (24 Phil. Rep., 1), that, before a 
conviction can be had under section 3 of Ordinance No. 152, "the defendants may 
prove, if the fact exists, that they visited the place described in the 
complaint lawfully and not in violation of the provisions or the spirit of said 
ordinance," and that, in effect, it must be shown, to sustain a conviction under 
said ordinance that the house visited was one generally used for the smoking of 
opium, and it appearing by an affirmative statement in the decision of the Court 
of First Instance that the house in question was a Chinese club and was not 
destined or generally used for the smoking of opium, and there being no finding 
that the accused were unlawfully there, the judgment of conviction has nothing 
to sustain it and is, therefore, absolutely void. That such being the case, a 
writ of habeas corpus will lie, it is contended, as imprisonment under a 
judgment absolutely void is an illegal imprisonment. In support of their 
contention petitioners cite numerous authorities folding in substance that, 
while a court may have authority to hear and determine a cause, its 
determination or judgment must be within the law and such power does not 
authorize it, simply because it has jurisdiction to render some judgment in the 
cause, to trample down the prisoners' fundamental and constitutional rights by 
pronouncing a sentence unauthorized by law. Or, to put the contention in another 
aspect, in addition to jurisdiction over the person and the subject matter, the 
court must have jurisdiction to render <em>the particular judgment.</em> 
Authorities are cited to the further proposition that habeas corpus will lie for 
the discharge of one imprisoned for an act which does not constitute any offense 
known to the law.</p>
<p>While the authorities cited sustain the propositions advanced, neither the 
one nor the other applies, in our judgment, to the case before us. It is 
admitted that the court had jurisdiction over the person of the petitioners and 
that it had jurisdiction to try a person accused of violating section 3 of 
Ordinance No. 152. There was, therefore, jurisdiction over the person and the 
subject matter. It is equally undoubted that, if the acts of the petitioners 
constituted the crime defined in that ordinance, they were properly convicted. 
It having been demonstrated by the evidence, as stated in the decision of the 
trial court, that the petitioners were found in the club house in question and 
that opium was being smoked therein, it became the duty of the court to 
determine, by the exercise of its judicial functions, whether such acts 
constituted the crime defined by the ordinance. This was a judicial 
determination admittedly within the jurisdiction and authority of the court to 
make. That being so, the exercise of that jurisdiction would not result in a 
void judgment, provided the court kept within the limits thereof. In the 
determination of the case before it, it is clear that the court kept fully 
within the limits of its jurisdiction and, exercising the authority which it had 
a right to exercise within that jurisdiction, determined the question whether 
the acts developed by the evidence fell within the prohibition of the ordinance. 
This same question is one which is passed upon by a court every time it tries a 
criminal cause. That is one of the necessary adjudications. If it is to be held 
that a wrong determination of that question deprives the court of jurisdiction, 
then the correctness of a judgment of conviction in a criminal case will nearly 
always be determinate by a writ of habeas corpus. (<em>Ex parte</em> Coy, 127 U. 
S., 731.) This, of course, is not the function of that writ, and makers of 
legislation and constitutions which preserve the writ never intended that it 
should be used in that manner and for that purpose.</p>
<p>The petitioners also cite authorities, among them cases of this court, which 
declare that a finding with nothing to sustain it is arbitrary and useless and 
is a nullity. (Edwards <em>vs.</em> McCoy, 22 Phil. Rep., 598.) We may admit, 
for purposes of discussion, that the authorities cited lay down the proposition 
as stated and still they fail to support the contention to which they are cited. 
It is to be noted that these decisions say that a finding with <em>nothing</em> 
to support it is a nullity. It should also be noted that in the cases in which 
those decisions are found there is absolutely nothing upon which the mind of the 
court making the finding could act to arrive at the conclusion reached. In other 
words, there was an entire absence of any fact whatever which by any possibility 
could support the finding or which could even tend to support it. The finding 
was utterly without relation to any fact of record, was drawn from nothing 
except imagination, was a pure invention, was not the result of the operation of 
the mind of the board upon a fact or circumstance, was not the product of the 
exercise of the deliberative faculty, but was a creation from nothing, a 
fiction, an arbitrary thing. That is not the case before us. Here we have 
evidence which supports the finding, although not sufficiently. There is 
evidence showing that opium was smoked in a house and that the accused were 
present at the time the smoking was going on. To support properly the judgment 
of conviction it would be necessary to have only two additional facts, namely, 
that the house was destined and generally used for the smoking of opium and that 
the accused were there unlawfully. Those two facts, added to the other facts 
already established, would have sustained a conviction.</p>
<p>Moreover, in considering these cases it must be remembered that they relate 
to the findings of boards of special inquiry and not to the decisions of 
courts.</p>
<p>It is clear, therefore, that the case in hand is not one where there is an 
absolute failure of anything to support the conviction, where the finding is a 
pure invention, a creature of the imagination only, an arbitrary thing. It is, 
rather, a case in which there is <em>some</em> evidence to support the 
conviction,<em> but not enough.</em> The difference between a finding with 
absolutely nothing to support it and a finding with something, although not 
sufficient, to support it, is very great. In fact, this difference is the 
determining feature of the case before us.</p>
<p>While the judgment attacked in these proceedings was erroneous and the 
conviction unwarranted by the evidence as it stands before us, it was not void. 
The record presents simply a case where the conviction is not sustained by the 
evidence. While it may be a case of improper conviction, the court had 
jurisdiction to convict and its determination, therefore, is not a nullity. It 
necessarily follows that the petitioners are restrained of their liberty by 
reason of being "in custody of an officer under process issued * * * by virtue 
of a judgment * * * of a court of record, and that the court * * * had 
jurisdiction to issue the process, render the judgment or make the order, * * * 
." (Code Civ. Proc, sec. 528.)</p>
<p>The applications for the writs are denied. Costs <em>de officio.</em></p>
<p>Since writing the above decision an application has been made to amend the 
petition in this proceeding by inserting an allegation to the effect that the 
action in which the petitioners were convicted was entitled, both in the 
municipal court and in the Court of First Instance, "City of Manila <em>vs.</em> 
Ngo Yao Tit, Chen Po, Uy Ching, Sec Hong, and Ngo Tiao" and "City of Manila 
<em>vs.</em> Chua Eng Cheng."</p>
<p>It is urged that, in view of the decision of this court in the case of the 
City of Manila <em>vs.</em> Rizal (p. 50, <em>ante</em>), the action should have 
been in the name of the United States and not the city of Manila; and that, the 
action having been wrongly entitled, the court acquired no jurisdiction of the 
person or the subject matter of the action and that its judgment of conviction 
was absolutely void. This being the case, it is argued, habeas corpus will lie 
as the imprisonment is illegal.</p>
<p>We cannot agree with this contention. The bringing of the action in the name 
of the city of Manila instead of the United States is an error merely and not a 
jurisdictional defect. It is not similar to the case where, as claimed by 
petitioners, an information is filed by a person who is not authorized in law to 
file it. The fact that the city of Manila was the plaintiff in the action does 
not signify that said city was the person who signed and filed the information. 
The accused were prosecuted by the same officials, before the same court, and in 
the same manner as they would have been if the action had been brought in the 
name of the United States, and they received the benefits of the same rights and 
the same privileges which they would have received if the action had been 
properly entitled. They have been in no sense injured or prejudiced.</p>
<p>The defect is one which could have been cured at any stage of the trial by an 
amendment on the motion of the court itself or upon the motion of any person 
interested in the prosecution. Defects of that character which are not taken 
advantage of in the court below in the manner prescribed by law cannot be raised 
for the first time here, and especially in a petition for a writ of habeas 
corpus.</p>
<p>The writ of habeas corpus was not intended and cannot be used to correct mere 
errors or defects in proceedings, and accordingly does not lie in the present 
application.</p>
<p>The writ is denied.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J.,</em> and <em>Araullo, J.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em>Carson</em> and <em>Trent, JJ.,</em> concur in the result.<br></p></div>
