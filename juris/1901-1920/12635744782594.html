				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This  was an  action  brought  originally  in the  court of the  justice of the peace  of the  city of Manila to recover the  possession of  the hotel building situated at the corner of Calle Palacio and  Calle Victoria in the city of Manila; to forfeit the sum of  5,705  pesos, which sum had  been deposited with the plaintiffs as security for the performance of the conditions  of a certain contract of lease,  and for damages alleged to have been  sustained by reason of the violation of said contract  of lease on the part of the defendants.</p>
<p>After hearing the evidence adduced in the trial of said cause in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, the judge thereof made the following finding of facts:</p>
<p>(1) On  the 9th day of April, 1.900,  the plaintiffs,  by their duly authorized agents,  entered into a  contract of lease with Kicardo  Flores and Jose Flores,  whereby the former leased to the latter the building in question for a term of five years and the plaintiffs made a conditional sale to the said Flores of the furniture therein.</p>
<p>(2) By the terms of the said lease the sum of 1,800 pesos was deposited with the plaintiffs by the said Flores to secure the rent, the said lease providing that at its termination, provided that all the terms thereof had been performed faithfully,  the title  to the furniture therein  would go to the lessee.</p>
<p>(3) The clauses of said lease which plaintiffs contended had been violated were as follows:</p>
<p>Paragraph 6 of said contract provided that the following obligations should be on account of the tenants:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"(<em>a</em>)  The  cleaning of the closets and canals; the painting of the inside and outside of the house, and any other obligations which  may be imposed upon him by competent authority on account of the public health or for any other reason;</p>
  <p>"(<em>b</em>)  The payment of the water account and the electric fluid;</p>
  <p>"(<em>c</em>)  The  payment  of  the difference between  the tax now paid on said  house and any after tax which may  be levied by the legal authorities;</p>
  <p>"(<em>d</em>)  The  payment  of  excess over  1Â¼ per cent as interest on 40,000 pesos now existing on said property, either on account of any change of tariff or on account  of any industry which may be established in said building."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(4) On the 3d day of May, 1900, the said contract was modified by the plaintiffs  transferring the absolute title to the furniture therein to the lessee in consideration  of said  lessee making a deposit  with the said  plaintiffs  of 3,905 pesos,  which was  the  amount  agreed upon as  the value of said furniture, which deposit was to be considered as a fund for additional security for the performance of the obligations on the part of the lessee.</p>
<p>(5)  Subsequently  the said  lease  was transferred  by Fllores to the association known as the "Manila Hotel Company,"  Ricardo Flores, <em>en comandita</em>,  together with  the furniture  mentioned therein, which was sold to the said association.</p>
<p>(6)  On the 7th day of June, 1901, the said association was dissolved and an agreement was entered into by and between the members of  said association,  whereby  Ricardo Flores and Jose Flores  transferred to Messrs. Brockmaii, Oppenheim, Nelle, Hermann, and  Jehrling the lease of the  building in question of "all his present right, title, and interest, and that which  he may have in the future in and to those certain establishments destined for hotel purposes and designated  under the names of the "Universal" and "Delmonico" hotels, situated respectively in  Oalle Palacio, No. 12, and Calle Palacio, No. 31, together with all the furniture, fixtures, and  effects therein contained at the present time,"  for a  certain  consideration  designated in said contract.</p>
<p>(7)  The above transfers by  the defendants to Messrs. Krockinan, Oppenheim, etc., were made  in one instrument in writing, the fourth clause of which is as follows: "There are considered included in the transfer of the above-named  establishments the leases  on  the properties occupied respectively  by the  same under the same terms and conditions as set forth  in the instrument executed for the said leases, which  are hereby declared transferred to the respective parties to whom the said hotels have .been adjudicated."</p>
<p>(8)  By virtue of the said  transfer Messrs. Brockman, Oppenheim &amp; Go. remained in possession of the building in question at Calle Palacio,  No. 31,  known as the "Delmonico Hotel," and operated the  same as a corporation known as  the "Manila Hotel Company."</p>
<p>(10)  In the month  of August, 1903, the plaintiffs were notified by the Board of Health of the  city of Manila to make certain improvements in the plumbing,  etc., in the said Dehnonico Hotel.</p>
<p>(11)  This  notice was immediately transferred to the defendants Ricardo and  Jos6  Flores,  who in  turn transferred the same to the  manager  of  the "Manila Hotel Company."</p>
<p>(12)  The time fixed in the original notice within which said improvements were to  be made was forty-five days. This period was extended from time to time by the said health authorities at the request of the manager of the said hotel company, up  to and including the 31st day of January, 1904.</p>
<p>(13)  On the 10th day of January, 1904, said hotel  company actually commenced the performance of the improvements  required by  the  said notice, and the  same were completed on  or about the 25th of January, 1904.</p>
<p>(14)  On the 1.2th  day of January, 1904, the agent of the plaintiffs, Miguel Velasco, was arrested and tried before the municipal court  of  the  city of Manila  on  the charge  of failing to comply with  the  said order  of  the Board  of Health within the time  required therein, and  was found guilty of said offense and fined the sum of $100, gold.  Said Velasco was the legal representative of the plaintiffs.</p>
<p>(15) The manager of the said hotel company was present in the said municipal court at  the trial of said cause and was ready and willing to testify, but he was not called as a witness by either the prosecution or defense.</p>
<p>(16) Immediately after said conviction the manager  of said hotel company offered to appeal said case on behalf of the said Velasco, but the latter refused to take an appeal and at once paid the fine.</p>
<p>(17) Immediately thereafter the said manager  offered to pay said Velasco the  amount of said fine,  which he refused to accept.</p>
<p>(18) On the 16th day  of January, 1904, the plaintiffs commenced an action before the justice of the peace of the city of Manila to recover possession of said premises, alleging that the defendants had forfeited their lease under said paragraph 6 of said  lease by their failure to make the repairs as demanded by the health authorities.  From the judgment of the said justice of the peace the  cause was appealed to the Court of First Instance.</p>
<p>(19)  The defendant, the hotel company,  in its answer presented in the Court of First Instance, offered to pay to the plaintiffs the line imposed upon him in said municipal court and made a tender of the same.</p>
<p>(20)  On  the litth of January, 1004, the day following the conviction of the said Velasco in the said  municipal court, the plaintiffs entered into a contract for the purpose of making some of the repairs required by the said Hoard of Health, but when the said contractor went to the said building for the purpose of making said repairs they found that the said hotel company was actually engaged in making the said improvements,  whereupon  the plaintiffs paid to their contractor the sum of $25, gold, to cancel his contract.</p>
<p>An examination of the evidence adduced during the trial of said cause presented to this court by the record justifies the foregoing finding of facts by the lower court.   They are not sufficient, in our  opinion, to warrant a forfeiture of the lease or of the fund on deposit with the plaintiffs.   If the defendants did not comply  with the  duties imposed upon  them  under paragraph 6 of  said  contract  above quoted, the plaintiffs were at liberty at any time after receiving the notice from the Board of Health to make such necessary repairs and charge the cost of the same to the defendants,  or either of them.  And if the defendants refused  to  pay the cost of said repairs, the  amount thereof might have been deducted from the funds in their possession.   However, inasmuch  as the delay  in making  the repairs required by the Board of Health was caused by the said hotel company, which  delay caused the plaintiffs to pay the sum of $100, gold, in the municipal court and the sum of $25, gold, to their contractor, the  said hotel company should be required to pay this amount.</p>
<p>The lower court rendered judgment against the defendants  for the sum  of  $125, gold, or 250  pesos.  In our opinion this judgment should  be and the  same is hereby affirmed.  After  the expiration of twenty days let judgment be entered in accordance herewith.  So ordered.</p>

<em>DISSENTING</em></div>
<p><strong>TORRES, J., </strong>with  whom concurs <strong>MAPA, J.:</strong></p>
<p>However much I might desire to concur with the majority opinion, I could  not give my consent to the same after a careful reading of the record, and, being thus compelled to state how, in my opinion, the case should be decided, I shall proceed to give the reasons why I think the judgment of the court below should be reversed.</p>
<p>The decision is based upon the tenants' breach of contract,  they having failed to comply with the obligations imposed upon them by a clause of the lease relating to the cleaning of the water-closets and the performance .of other work required by the  Board of Health, and consequently the decision to the contrary of the court below is directly opposed to the provisions of article 1091 of the Civil Code which  provides;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Obligations arising from  contracts  have  legal  force between the contracting parties, and must  be fulfilled in accordance with their stipulations."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is also  in direct opposition  to  the well-established rule that the stipulations of a contract have the force of law  between the  parties.   (Judgments of the Supreme Court  of Spain, of the 20th of February, 1897, and 13th of February, 1904.)</p>
<p>For the failure to comply with the orders of the Board of Health, after the expiration of the last extension granted for the performance of the work required in said orders, the representative of the minor owners of the property leased was convicted and lined by the municipal court of Manila, all of which appears from the record in this case.</p>
<p>If, on the 12th of January, 1904, the extension of time granted for the performance of the work was still in force, on the 9th of the same month the complaint would not have been filed and there would have been no reason whatsoever for imposing a  fine  upon the owners of the house. The  fine was imposed because,  although  the extension granted to the 15th of December had expired, the work was not commenced until the 11th of January.   It was so stated by the  sanitary  engineer,  August  Jardin  (record, p. 4(J), who testified  that he Avas living at the time in the house then occupied by the Hotel Delmonico; that on the 12th  of  January, 1904, the  work ordered by  the Board of  Health had not  even been begun, and that  the installation of the electric light which was then being made could not  have interfered Avith the work in  any  way.  His statement is corroborated by the testimony of Kicardo Klores and Hugh Hidel,  who testified that  they examined the premises on  the 7th of January and  that the work ordered by the Board of Health during the month  of  the previous August had not been performed,  and that complaint Avas filed in the municipal court on the 9th of January, and the trial took  place on the 12th  of said month, when  the representative of  the  plaintiffs  attempted to comply with the order of the Board of Health after he had been fincMl by the municipal  court.   On the 12th of January aforesaid the tenants prevented the contractors from going ahead  with the work and they, the defendants .themselves, undertook to do it at their own expense, as appears from a  letter  introduced in  evidence.   (Record, p. 70.)  It should be borne in mind, however, that the Board of Health granted the representative of the minor OAvners fifteen days to do the work und that  the tenants, acknOAvledging their breach of  the contract,  undertook to do this Avork  themselves  within  the aforesaid fifteen  days granted  to the said representative from the 13th of the said  month of January.</p>
<p>The twelfth finding of the court below,, which has been accepted by the majority  of this court, is to the  effect that the time within which the said repairs Ayere to be made was forty-five days, which was extended from time to time by the Board of Health at the request of  the manager of the Manila Hotel Company  until the 31st of January, 1894, inclusive.  This finding of  the court  below  is not right.</p>
<p>The  first period of forty-five days granted August 30, 1903, Avas  several times extended, the last extension expiring on the 15th of December of that year, as appears from the record.   But it was satisfactorily shown that no other extension was applied for and granted prior to the 31st of January, as the witness, Dr. R. E. L. Newberne, medical inspector,  (record, p. 52), testified that at the request of the tenants, time for performing the work required  by  the Board of Health was extended to the 15th of December, 1903, notwithstanding that Robert Hartwig,  manager of the Manila Hotel Company, requested by letter, on the  6th of October, an extension of the said time until the 31st of said month of December, which was the last  extension granted  for the performance of the work, there being no evidence to show that the tenants applied for a new  extension or that any extension was granted after the 15th of December, 1903.  The extension of fifteen days granted the representative  of tfie  minor owners  on the 13th of January, 1904, was a new extension obtained  by him and not by the tenants who, knowing what their obligation was, insisted  upon doing the work  required by  the  Board of Health themselves.  The work  was completed within J;he special extension and not Within the original time granted in subsequent extensions.  As has already been said, the last extension granted by the Board of Health expired on the 15th  of December, and there is no proof that there was any further extension applied for or granted after the 15th of December.</p>
<p>The  note in red ink which appears in the books  of the department to the effect that an extension had been granted to the  31st of  January, 1904",  referred to the extension granted Seiior Velasco for an additional fifteen days; there is no evidence that the extension to the 15th of December was subsequently  enlarged so as to include the 31st  of January, as found by the court below.</p>
<p>The  court  below found that  there was  a  delay on the part of the lessees in the performance of the work required by the  Board of Health, and by way of indemnification to the plaintiffs he ordered the defendants to pay to them the sum of 250 pesos,  local  currency.  This shows that the court  below recognized  that there had  been a breach  of contract  of  lease between  the parties.  Notwithstanding the note in red ink which was improperly entered upon the books, it has been shown  that no further extension was granted by the Board of Health after the 15th of December.</p>
<p>The finding of  the court below to the effect that the lease in question did not require the lessees to comply with the  obligations  mentioned in clause 6  of  the contract, within any specified time,  is also erroneous and contrary to law as shown by a mere reading of the documents evidencing the contract between the parties.</p>
<p>The most notable and singular thing in this case is the answer  filed  by  the defendants Ricardo and Jos6 Flores, appearing on page 68 of the  record.   They admitted all the allegations of the complaint.   They also  admitted that the Manila Hotel Company, sublessee of the premises, not only did not perform the  work  which it was. bound to perform under the contract within the time required by the Board of Health and the various extensions granted  by it, but it did not even commence such work, and under section 124  of the Code of Civil  Procedure,  prayed that  it be determined and  adjudged that the liability rested solely with the Manila Hotel Company.</p>
<p>Therefore,  there can be no doubt that there was a breach of the contract of lease between the parties.  This is clearly shown by the evidence taken at the trial.  The defendants have consequently lost their right to the P3,905, the value of the furniture purchased by them.   Even considering the obligation contracted by them as a penal clause, the most that the court below  could have done under article 1154 of this Civil Code would have been to mitigate the penalty in case of nonfulfillment of any of the obligations stipulated in the contract, but it would be  unjust and illegal not to admit that the plaintiffs were entitled to the whole amount, or at least to two-thirds of the money deposited.</p>
<p>Considering, therefore, that the judgment of the court below is plainly  and manifestly against the  weight of the evidence introduced by  the plaintiffs, and that the  same is contrary to law, I am of opinion that the said judgment should be reversed and the case decided in accordance with the  prayer  of the complaint.</p>
