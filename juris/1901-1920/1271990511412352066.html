				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The defendant in this case was convicted of a violation of section 30&nbsp; of the Election&nbsp; Law&nbsp; by the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of the Province of Capiz, and sentenced to pay a fine of P200,&nbsp; to imprisonment in case of&nbsp; insolvency, and to pay the costs of the trial.&nbsp; He appealed.<br><br>It appears&nbsp; that&nbsp; during&nbsp; the month of July,&nbsp; 1907, the accused,&nbsp; who&nbsp; was&nbsp; then municipal president of Jamindan, made an inspection of the barrio of San Juan, situated in said municipality,&nbsp; accompanied by&nbsp; two&nbsp; policemen&nbsp; armed with rifles.&nbsp; On that inspection he&nbsp; entered the house of Gregorio Maximo,&nbsp; with&nbsp; whom he&nbsp; spoke&nbsp; concerning the election which was to be held during that month.&nbsp; During the course of the conversation he requested&nbsp; Maximo to vote for Jose Altavas for member of the Assembly.&nbsp; Maximo answered that he could not do so because&nbsp; he&nbsp; had already promised to vote&nbsp; for Hugo Vidal.&nbsp; At&nbsp; this&nbsp; the&nbsp; accused became furious and sought&nbsp; to intimidate Maximo, threatening that if&nbsp; he voted for anybody but Altavas he would find himself at the joint of a gun, that he would learn that the accused was the one who&nbsp; governed&nbsp; in&nbsp; Jamindan.&nbsp; He used other threatening language also.&nbsp; It further appears that some days after the election Maximo was taken from his house by a couple of Constabulary and another man by the name of Biloy, a cousin of the accused, at the instigation&nbsp; of the accused.&nbsp; The&nbsp; accused ordered the Constabulary to punish Maximo, and, after they had bound him to a tree, they proceeded to maltreat and beat&nbsp; him.<br><br>The conclusions&nbsp; of fact&nbsp; of&nbsp; the court below are fully justified by the proofs adduced on the trial.<br><br>The assignments of error interposed&nbsp; on behalf&nbsp; of the defendant are&nbsp; partly disposed&nbsp; of upon the&nbsp; facts.&nbsp; The remaining assignments of error relate to the question whether or not the threats&nbsp; proved were sufficient under the law to justify a conviction. We&nbsp; do&nbsp; not deem argument necessary to demonstrate that the&nbsp; court was&nbsp; right in his conclusions of law.&nbsp; We simply call attention to the language of section 30 of Act No. 1582, the terms of which are too clear to require comment:<br><blockquote>"Any person who, by any wrongful means, shall prevent or&nbsp; attempt&nbsp; to&nbsp; prevent any&nbsp; voter from freely&nbsp; and&nbsp; fully exercising his right to vote,&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; shall be punished by&nbsp; imprisonment for not less than&nbsp; thirty&nbsp; days nor more than one year, or&nbsp; by a fine of not less&nbsp; than two hundred pesos&nbsp; nor more than five hundred pesos, or both, in the discretion of the court."<br></blockquote>The judgment of the court below&nbsp; is affirmed, with costs against&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellant.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Johnson,</i> and <i>Carson, JJ.</i>, concur.<br></div>
