				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This  is an original action brought in this court by virtue of the provisions of Act  No. 1376.  The construction of certain sections of this  act has been twice before us  in The Roman Catholic Church <em>vs</em>. The Municipality of Badoc etal. (6 Phil. Rep., 345) and  The Roman Catholic  Church <em>vs</em>. The Municipality of Badoc et al.  (7 Phil. Rep.,  566).</p>
<p>The complaint as  amended alleged  that the  Roman Catholic  Church was the owner of, and till within a few years before the filing of the complaint had been in possession of, the following described lands:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="center">"V.</p>
  <p>"(a) In the said municipality of Tarlac: "1.  The open square known as the plaza of the church of Tarlac, situated within the area which formerly  constituted the pueblo of Tarlac.</p>
  <p>"2.  In  the  territory  which formerly  constituted the pueblo of La Paz and is now the barrio of La Paz in the municipality of Tarlac:</p>
  <p>"The grounds of the old church of La Paz, known as the grounds of the old church and convent of La Paz; "The grounds of the old cemetery of  La Paz, known as the old cemetery of La Paz;</p>
  <p>"The new cemetery of  La Paz, known as the new cemetery of La Paz.</p>
  <p>"The above-mentioned  lands are at present in  the possession of and under the  administration of the defendants, Gregorio Aglipay and the municipality  of Tarlac.</p>
  <p>"(a) In the said municipality of Victoria:</p>
  <p>"1. The grounds of the church of Victoria, bounded by the four  streets called  <em>procesionales</em> and known as the plaza of the church of Victoria;</p>
  <p>"2. The chapels and their corresponding grounds, situated  in the barrios of  Calibungan, San  Andres, Balbaloto, and Bantog.</p>
  <p>"The above-mentioned  properties are  at  present in the possession of and under the administration of the defendants,  Gregorio Aglipay,  Antonio Mariano, Canuto Aglipay, Geronimo Velasco,  municipal president of Victoria, and the municipality of Victoria."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The prayer  of the amended complaint was that  the Roman Catholic Church be declared to be the owner of the property described therein and that no one of the defendants had any right or interest therein.  It also asked for the appointment of a receiver and a preliminary injunction prohibiting the use of the property, during the pendency of the action, by the Independent Filipino  Church.</p>
<p>The complaint was duly served on all of the defendants except  Antonio  Mariano,  The  only  answer  which was filed purported to be the answer of <em>la parte demandada</em>. In the case above cited, reported in Volume VI, Philippine Reports, page 345, we said that on its face this was  an answer of  all the defendants.   Whether in this particular case it was intended as such is rendered doubtful by other circumstances which appear therein.  However, as it was the only answer  filed in the case, if it is to be considered as the answer only of Gregorio Aglipay, all the other defendants would be in default, and by the terms of section 4  of  said  act judgment could be entered against them without proof of any of the allegations of the complaint.</p>
<p>A commissioner  was appointed to take evidence and such evidence was taken and reported to the court.   Thereafter the plaintiffs and the Attorney-General, acting  by direction of  the  Governor-General,  as  the  representative of the defendant municipalities  of Tarlac  and Victoria, made an agreement as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"That the plaintiff's complaint herein, so far as it alleges ownership  and right of occupation  of all public highways and plazas, and especially the plazas in the municipalities of Tarlac and Victoria, in the Province of Tarlac, shall  be dismissed without prejudice and  all claim on the part  of the plaintiffs thereto shall be eliminated from said action."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the brief filed by the plaintiffs, they  say that the matter in dispute in the case is reduced to the lands described  in  paragraph V, (a) 2â€”that is to say, to the lot on which the church of the former pueblo of La Paz, now a barrio of the municipality of Tarlac, was situated, and the old cemetery and the new cemetery of the same barrio.</p>
<p>The only questions  to be considered, therefore,  relate to this property in the barrio of La Paz, in the municipality of Tarlac,  and the only defendants interested therein are the defendants Gregorio Aglipay and the municipality  of Tarlac.</p>
<p>The evidence presented by the plaintiffs in regard to this property showed  that the church in the barrio  of La Paz had been destroyed during the revolution, and that prior to its destruction it, and the two cemeteries,  had been for more  than twenty-five years under the control of,  and administered by, the Roman Catholic priest of that pueblo The defendants presented before the commissioner no evidence at all  relating to this property.</p>
<p>In the answer above referred to it is alleged that the property described in the complaint is public property belonging to the Government of the Philippine Islands; that the possession enjoyed by the plaintiff church of the property was only for  the purpose of administration, and that all its rights thereto ceased when the Spanish sovereignty ceased in  these Islands.   It  also  alleged that the Independent  Filipino Church took possession of the property by virtue of the circular of the Insular Government of the 10th of January,  1903, for the purpose of administering it for the benefit of the inhabitants of the municipality.</p>
<p>It will thus be seen that upon this branch of the case the only question presented either  by the answer  or  by the brief is the question  as to whether  the property in controversy is or  is  not owned by the Government of the Philippine Islands, and the brief is devoted principally to an argument of this question, a question which has  been discussed and decided adversely to the claim of the defendants in the cases of Barlin <em>vs</em>. Ramirez (7 Phil.  Rep., 41), Roman Catholic Church <em>vs</em>.  Santos  (7 Phil.  Rep., 66), and the City of Manila <em>vs</em>. The Roman  Catholic Church  (8 Phil. Rep., 763).</p>
<p>It was  there held that the King of Spain was not the owner of the property involved in those cases, and that the title thereto did not, therefore, pass by the treaty of Paris to the Government of the United States.  It was further held that the municipalities were not the owners of such property and had  no right or interest therein.   Applying the principle of those cases  to this  case,  the result  is  that the plaintiffs are  entitled to judgment for possession as prayed for in the complaint.</p>
<p>There is, moreover, another line  of reasoning by which the same result is  reached, without taking into consideration the  peculiar nature of the property here in controversy,  and without considering that it is property devoted to religious worship.</p>
<p>It was proven at the trial that the plaintiff church had been in possession of this property for more than twenty-five years.  It was admitted in the  answer and in the briefs that such possession had existed up to at least 1898. The defendants, in or after  that year, took possession of the property.   As we have seen, they did so without any right whatever.  Under such circumstances, we have held that the plaintiff church can  maintain an action to recover the possession of which it has thus been deprived, notwithstanding the fact that it did not commence  such action within one year from the time when it lost possession.  In other words, where the defendant is able to show no title or interest in himself, a plaintiff who has been in possession of the  property for a great number  of years may recover such possession of the defendant, although the plaintiff has no written evidence of ownership. This was held in the case of the Bishop of Cebu <em>vs</em>. Mangaron (6 Phil. Rep., 286).  In that case it was said, at page 299:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Article 1635 of the old Code of  Civil Procedure not having been repealed by the Civil Code, if the accion publiciana existed prior to its enactment, it must necessarily exist after  such  enactment.  We consequently conclude that the action brought by  the plaintiff in this  case to recover the possession of which he was unlawfully deprived by the defendant can be properly maintained under the provisions  of the present Civil Code considered as a substantive law, without prejudice to any right  which he may have to the ownership  of the property, which ownership lie must necessarily  establish  in  order  to  overcome the presumption of title which exists in favor  of the lawful possessor, the4plaintiff  in this  case,  who had been in the quiet and peaceful possession of the land for twenty years, more or less, at the time he was wrongfully dispossessed by the defendant."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During the progress of this case the defendant, Gregorio Aglipay, made a motion to dismiss the same on the ground that Act No. 1376 was void because it was inconsistent with the provisions  of  the act of Congress of July 1, 1902, relating to  the Philippine Islands.</p>
<p>We held  in the case reported in Volume VI, Philippine Reports, page 345, above cited, that this objection could not be raised by motion, but must be considered when the case was decided upon its merits.  The same question has been presented by the answer and argued in the brief.</p>
<p>The particular ground on which this claim is  based is that the law denies to the Independent Filipino Church and the municipalities the equal protection  of the laws, and is therefore in violation of the first paragraph of section 5 of the act of Congress above cited, which provides:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"That no law shall be enacted in said Islands which shall deprive  any person of life, liberty,  or  property  without due process of law, or deny to any person therein the equal protection of the laws."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Act No. 1376 gives original jurisdiction  to this court of controversies between the Roman Catholic Church and the Filipino  Independent Church  and the  municipalities of the Islands relating to the ownership of church property therein.   It provides that the Roman Catholic Church may commence an action in this court against the Independent Filipino Church and the municipalities  in relation to the property above  mentioned.   It also provides  that  the municipalities may commence such  action in this  court against the Roman Catholic Church.  But it is said that the law discriminates against the municipalities in that it does not allow them to commence such actions without the consent of the Attorney-General and that the municipalities are thereby denied  the equal protection  of the laws.   We see nothing Avhatever in this point,  nor in any other of the suggestions made in the motion and brief of the defendants. In the case  of The United States <em>vs</em>. The Union Pacific Railroad Co.  (98 U. S.,  569) there was under discussion an act of Congress which directed the  Attorney-General to commence suit in equity in any  circuit  court of  the United States against the Union Pacific Railroad Company and other defendants.   That law gave to the plaintiff in that case rights which were not enjoyed by other plaintiffs suing in the same court and imposed obligations upon the defendants which were not  imposed upon other  persons sued as defendants therein.  It was  claimed that the act was void as being in violation  of the fifth amendment to the Constitution, and it was also said that it violated "the fundamental right of citizens under a free government to equality before the law."  In holding the law constitutional, the court said, at page 608:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"We are of opinion, therefore, that the act in question was intended not to change the substantial rights of the parties to  the suit which it authorized, but  to provide a specific method of procedure, which, by removing restrictions on the jurisdiction, process, and pleading in ordinary cases, would give a larger scope for the action of the court, and a more  economical  and efficient remedy than before existed, and  that  it is a valid and constitutional exercise of legislative power."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By section 9 of the  act  of Congress of July 1, 1902, above cited, it is provided as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"That the Supreme Court and the Courts  of  First Instance of the Philippine Islands shall possess  and exercise jurisdiction  as heretofore provided,  and such additional jurisdiction as shall hereafter be prescribed by the Government of said Islands,  *   *  *."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This provision did not take away from the Commission the power  to pass the act in question.</p>
<p>It is  therefore by the court adjudged and  decreed that this action be dismissed without costs as to the defendants Canuto Aglipay, Ger6riimo  Velasco, and the municipality of Victoria.</p>
<p>It is further adjudged and decreed that  all  of the property described in the complaint, as amended, be eliminated therefrom,  except that relating to the land  upon which the church  of  the barrio of La Paz, in the municipality of Tarlac, was situated, and the old cemetery of said barrio and the new cemetery of said barrio, and as to  the property thus  eliminated  this court makes no determination  in regard to the rights of the parties to this action in relation thereto.</p>
<p>It is further adjudged and decreed that the plaintiff, the Roman  Catholic Apostolic Church, is entitled to the  immediate possession of  the following-described property situated in  the municipality of Tarlac, Province of Tarlac, to wit:  The grounds of the old church of La  Paz, known as the grounds of the old church and convent of La Paz; the grounds of the old cemetery of La Paz, known as the old cemetery of La Paz, and the new cemetery of La Paz, known as  the new cemetery of La Paz; and that neither the municipality  of Tarlac nor  the defendant, Gregorio Aglipay,  <em>obispo  maximo</em> of  the  Independent  Filipino Church, has any right, title, or interest therein.</p>
<p>It is further adjudged and decreed that the property last hereinbefore  mentioned be returned to the plaintiffs and that the said defendants  be ousted  from the possession thereof, and  that such possession be awarded to the plaintiffs.</p>
<p>It is further adjudged and  decreed that a writ of possession issue out of this court against the defendants, the municipality of  Tarlac  and  Gregorio  Aglipay,  obispo mawimo of the Independent Filipino Church, in the manner and form prescribed by Act  No. 190.   No costs will be allowed to any party.  So ordered.</p>

<p><strong>JOHNSON</strong> and <strong>CARSON, JJ</strong>.:</p>
<p>We agree with the  dispositive part of the foregoing decision, which  adjudges the  right of possession  in favor of the plaintiffs,  adopting in  this case the reasoning of the concurring opinion in the  case of Barlin <em>vs</em>. Ramirez (7 Phil. Rep., 41).</p>
