				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The defendant has been convicted of the crime of treason as  defined  in Act No.  292,  section  1,  and  sentenced to death.</p>
<p>It was proved that he was a soldier in the Constabulary stationed at  Imus,  in the Province  of Cavite; that on October 13,1902, he deserted and was captured on October 27,1902.  When he was captured he stated  to the inspector, according to the latter's testimony, that he had given the arms which he took with  him to his general,  Montalon. Upon his person was found a commission, making  him a second lieutenant, signed by Montalon and dated October 14.   The only witness to the finding of this commission was the inspector.  There  was evidence that, in October, Montalon was in armed rebellion against the Government and that there  had  been engagements in  that  month between his troops and the forces of the Constabulary.</p>
<p>Section 9 of the act of Congress of March 8,  1902, is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"SEC. 9.  That no person in the Philippine Islands shall, under the authority  of the United States,  be  convicted of treason  by any tribunal, civil or military, unless on  the testimony of  two witnesses to the same overt  act,  or on confession  in open court."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Passing for the present the testimony of the defendant at the trial, there was  no other evidence  in the case to show that he had ever joined the forces of Montalon, except the testimony of the inspector as to  the confession made when  he was  captured and  the commission  as second lieutenant found  upon his  person.   Under  the act of Congress there can be no conviction, unless two witnesses testify to the same overt act of treason.  There is no such testimony in this  case.   The evidence of the Government related exclusively to the desertion of the defendant and his capture.</p>
<p>The act of Congress provides that  there may be a conviction upon a confession in open court.   The defendant testified as a witness in his own behalf at the trial.   He denied that he had deserted, but claimed that he had been carried off by force by soldiers of Montalon and taken to the latter's camp.   He  promised to serve them, and they made him a lieutenant  and gave him a revolver.  He remained with them two  weeks, but  he says that it  was against his will and that he had no opportunity to escape, except the time when he was captured.   This  was not a confession within the meaning of the  said section 9.   The confession  there mentioned means a  confession of guilt. The section can not be extended so as to include admissions of facts made by him in giving his testimony after a plea of not  guilty,  from which  admissions his guilt  can be inferred.  The  evidence required by the act of Congress does not appear in this case.</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to consider the point made by the  defendant's counsel  that,  in  view of the official proclamations, there existed  no state  of  insurrection or war in Cavite in October,  1902,</p>
<p>The judgment is reversed and  the defendant acquitted only of the crime charged in this complaint, with the costs <em>de oficio</em>, and without  prejudice to  the presentation of complaints for the other crimes of which the evidence in this case indicates  that the defendant may be guilty.</p>
<p><em> Arellano, C. J., Torres, Cooper, Mapa, McDonough,</em> and <em>Johnson, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
