				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This was an action commenced in&nbsp; the Court of First Instance of the Province of&nbsp; Samar by the plaintiff to recover of the defendants a boat or <span style="font-style: italic;">lanchon</span>, or its value, alleged to be P1,000, together with damages in the sum of P4,680.&nbsp; The defendant,&nbsp; Yu Sefao, at&nbsp; first presented&nbsp; a demurrer, which was overruled.&nbsp; Later, he presented a general&nbsp; and special defense.&nbsp; Still later,&nbsp; he asked permission to withdraw his counterclaim and instead thereof to present the defense that the plaintiffs were without legal&nbsp; capacity to sue.&nbsp;&nbsp; The defendants, Behn,&nbsp; Meyer &amp; Co., presented a general denial. Later, Behn, Meyer &amp; Co., were absolved from all liability under the complaint.<br><br>After hearing the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause, the Honorable Ramon Avance√±a, in a carefully prepared&nbsp; opinion, reached the conclusion:&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) That the plaintiffs&nbsp; had legal capacity to&nbsp; sue; and (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>)&nbsp; rendered a judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendant, Yu Sefao, in the sum of P990.<br><br>From&nbsp; that judgment,&nbsp; after presenting a&nbsp; motion for a new&nbsp; trial, the defendant, Yu&nbsp; Sefao, appealed to this court. The&nbsp; only assignment of error made by the&nbsp; appellant here is that the lower court committed an error in deciding that the plaintiffs had&nbsp; legal capacity to sue.&nbsp;&nbsp; The defendant and appellant argues that the plaintiffs had been doing business under the name of <span style="font-style: italic;">Lopez Hermanos</span>; that they had not been organized as a society, in accordance with the provisions of the Commercial Code, and that, therefore, they were not authorized to sue and cited decisions of&nbsp; this court in support of that conclusion.&nbsp; Evidently the defendant and appellant had not examined the complaint presented by the plaintiffs.&nbsp; An examination of the complaint would&nbsp; have shown the defendant that the present action&nbsp; was not&nbsp; commenced&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; name of <span style="font-style: italic;">Lopez Hermanos,</span>&nbsp; but in the individual names of the persons constituting the alleged society or mercantile association.&nbsp;&nbsp; We find nothing in the procedure in the present case which is in conflict with&nbsp; the decisions cited by the appellant.&nbsp; The plaintiffs in the present case, even granting that the society called <span style="font-style: italic;">Lopez Hermanos</span> was not authorized to sue in the name of said society for the&nbsp; reason&nbsp; that it&nbsp; had not been properly&nbsp; organized, yet, nevertheless, they were permitted to "sue in their individual names.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Prautch <i>vs.</i> Jones,&nbsp; 8 Phil. Rep.,&nbsp; 1;&nbsp; Strachan &amp; MacMurray <i>vs.</i> Emaldi, 22 Phil. Rep., 295.)<br><br>The appellant having presented no question&nbsp; here except the&nbsp; one above&nbsp; discussed, and it&nbsp; having&nbsp; been found&nbsp; that the plaintiffs had legal capacity to sue, we must affirm the decision of the lower court.&nbsp; The same is, therefore, hereby affirmed with costs.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Carson, Trent,</i> and <i>Araullo, JJ.,</i> concur.<br></div>
