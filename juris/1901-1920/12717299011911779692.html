				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The defendant was accused of the crime of <i>estafa</i> in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Leyte, was found guilty and was sentenced to be imprisoned&nbsp; for a period of two months and one day of <i>arresto mayor,</i> with&nbsp; the accessories of the law, and to pay the costs, under paragraph 5&nbsp; of&nbsp; article 535, in relation with article&nbsp; 534 of&nbsp; the Penal Code.<br><br>From that sentence the&nbsp; defendant appealed and made several assignments of error here.<br><br>It&nbsp; appears from&nbsp; the&nbsp; complaint and&nbsp; from the evidence brought to this court that the relation between the&nbsp; defendant and the prosecuting witness,&nbsp; Tan-Chingco, is&nbsp; that of <i>debtor</i> and&nbsp; <i>creditor</i> simply.&nbsp;&nbsp; The evidence discloses no relation of&nbsp; any&nbsp; of&nbsp; the classes of bailments, agency, or of fidelity.&nbsp; The relation is simply that of debtor and creditor. The Spanish&nbsp; courts and Spanish&nbsp; authors&nbsp; seem&nbsp; to be in hopeless conflict upon the question whether or&nbsp; not&nbsp; persons holding the relation of debtor simply may be guilty of the crime of <i>estafa,</i> under paragraph&nbsp; 5 of article 535 of the Penal Code.&nbsp; We are of the opinion&nbsp; and so decide that when the relation is purely that of a debtor and creditor, the debtor can not be held liable for the crime of <i>estafa,</i> under said article, by merely refusing to pay or by denying&nbsp; the indebtedness.&nbsp; Therefore,&nbsp; without discussing&nbsp; or deciding the&nbsp; other&nbsp; questions presented&nbsp; by the&nbsp; appellant, it is hereby ordered&nbsp; that the sentence of the lower court be reversed and that an order be entered dismissing the complaint and absolving the defendant from all liability under the same, with costs <i>de oficio</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is so ordered.<br><br><i> Torres, Mapa,</i> and <i>Moreland,&nbsp; JJ</i>., concur.<br><br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="center"><br><center><br><span style="font-style: italic;">CONCURRING</span><br></center><br><br><b>CARSON, <i>J</i>., </b><br><br>I&nbsp; agree with&nbsp; the disposing&nbsp; portion&nbsp; of the&nbsp; foregoing opinion.<br><br>I do not understand that there is any conflict of authority either in Spain or in the United&nbsp; States as to the non-liability of a&nbsp; debtor to imprisonment for failure to pay his&nbsp; debt, where the relation&nbsp; between&nbsp; himself&nbsp; and&nbsp; his creditor is simply that of debtor and creditor.&nbsp; No Spanish court or author, so far as I am aware, has ever construed the body of Spanish Law now in force in these Islands or which was in force at the time&nbsp; when Spain relinquished its sovereignty to the United States, so as to hold that when the relation is purely that of a debtor and creditor,&nbsp; the debtor may be held liable for the crime of&nbsp; <i>estafa </i>or&nbsp; any other crime, by merely failing or&nbsp; refusing to&nbsp; pay the indebtedness.<br><br>The conflict of&nbsp; Spanish authority appears to be limited to the question whether a debtor may be held guilty of the crime of <i>estafa</i>,&nbsp; who knowingly, maliciously and for the purpose of gain&nbsp; (<i>con&nbsp; onimo de lucro</i>), falsely denies the existence of his debt.<br><br>This, of course, is a wholly different matter from a refusal or failure to pay the&nbsp; debt.<br><br>The Supreme Court of Spain has uniformly&nbsp; held that such a&nbsp; denial constitutes one of the offenses&nbsp; defined and penalized in&nbsp; the&nbsp; chapter of the Penal Code which deals with&nbsp; <i>estafa</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Viada, Pacheco and&nbsp; other Spanish authors vigorously contend that the provisions of that chapter of the code defining the crime of<i> estafa</i> are not broad enough to include the <i>false denial of the existence of a debt</i>.&nbsp; "Much may be said&nbsp; on both sides of the contention;" but construing these provisions of the Penal Code with that strictness with which American courts have always held themselves bound to construe penal&nbsp; statutes&nbsp; generally, I think that this&nbsp; court is justified in departing from the doctrine laid down by the supreme court&nbsp; of Spain, and&nbsp; in holding that the false denial by a debtor of the existence of a&nbsp; debt contracted by him, even when such a denial is knowingly false, malicious and&nbsp; made "<i>con animo de lucro"</i> does not constitute the crime of <i>estafa,</i> defined arid penalized in the code.<br><br>This, as I&nbsp; understand it, is the&nbsp; real question involved in this&nbsp; appeal.<br></div>
