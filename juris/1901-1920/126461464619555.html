				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE, VS. ELENO LIUANAG ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.

				<BR><STRONG>LADD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The appellants, Liuanag, Quinto,  Sinambal, and Joaquin, have been convicted by the Court  of First Instance of Rizal of <em>robo en cuadrilla</em>, under  No. 5 of  article 503 of the Code,  in connection with article 504, and sentenced to six years ten months and one day of <em>presidio  mayor</em>.  They were tried jointly with Fulgencio Magpayo, who was acquitted.  The Government  did  not appeal  from  the acquittal of Magpayo.</p>
<p>The evidence against  the  appellants was as follows: Lorenzo Ramos, a Constabulary inspector,  testified that lie captured Quinto, Sinambal, and Joaquin  in a banca in the Atlag River in the pueblo of  Malolos,  Bulacan, one night in September, 1902; that he found two sewing machines, some money, and two bolos in the banca in their possession; that they admitted  they had stolen the sewing machines and the money; that Quinto gave information which led to the apprehension the same night of the other appellant, Liuanag; that they found in Liuanag's possession a large amount of jewelry, some money, and a gun and 150 cartridges; that Liuanag confessed that a part of the jewelry had fallen to him as his share of the proceeds of robberies committed in the barrio of Dampalit, pueblo of Malabon, Rizal, and that he had bought part of it for a small sum from the other robbers.</p>
<p>Leon  de la Rosa, also an officer of the Constabulary, who was with Ramos when the arrests were made, confirms in all substantial respects the testimony of the latter.</p>
<p>The sewing machines and  a part of the  jewelry were brought into court and  identified  by  their  owners, who stated that they were taken  from their respective houses in the barrio of Dampalit, pueblo of Malabon, by robbers, the witnesses being in their houses at the time of the robberies. Candida Garcia, the owner of some of  the jewelry and one of the sewing machines, testified that the robbers who attacked her house on the occasion when this  property was taken were five in number, all armed.   None of  these witnesses give the date of these  robberies, but they all state that they were committed in  the nighttime.</p>
<p>No  witnesses were introduced by the defense.</p>
<p>The evidence leaves no room for doubt that the  appellants  belonged  to an armed  band  of outlaws,  who committed various robberies in the barrio of Dampalit, pueblo of Malabon, Rizal, on a night just previous to the time of their arrest in September, 1902.  The evidence of Candida Garcia shows that the band numbered at least five.  All the elements of the crime of <em>robo en cuadrilla</em> are established, and the conviction was right.</p>
<p>The court below should, however, have appreciated the aggravating circumstances of Nos. 15 arid 20 of article 10 of the Code, and should consequently  have applied the penalty in the maximum degree.  We fix the penalty at ten years of <em>presidio mayor</em> modifying  the judgment in this respect and affirming it in all other respects, and the cause will be returned to the court below for the execution of the same.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Cooper, Willard,</em> and <em>Mapa, JJ.,</em>concur.</p>
