				<h4>
				G.R. No. 12718, July 28, 1917</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. DOMINGO CRUZ, (ALIAS) DOMINGO DEL ROSARIO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The guilt of the defendant and appellant of the crime of illegal marriage 
(bigamy) is admitted. The sole basis of the argument of counsel for appellant is 
that the accused has been placed twice in jeopardy because also tried and 
convicted of the crime of <em>amancebamiento</em> (concubinage) arising out of 
the same facts. A sufficient answer is that the plea of former jeopardy cannot 
be urged for the first time in the Supreme Court. (U. S. <em>vs</em>. Perez 
[1902], 1 Phil., 203; Mooring <em>vs</em>. The State [1900], 129 Ala., 66; 135 
Am. St. Rep. [1909], 79, Note IV.).
<p>There being present neither aggravating nor mitigating circumstance, the 
penalty should have been imposed in its medium degree. The judgment of the lower 
court is therefore modified by sentencing the defendant to eight years and one 
day of <em>prision mayor</em>, to the accessory penalties of article 61 of the 
Penal Code, and to pay one-half of the costs in the first instance and all the 
costs in this instance. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Johnson, Carson, Araullo</em>, and <em>Street, JJ.,</em> 
concur.</p></div>
