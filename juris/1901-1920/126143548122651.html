				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. JUAN LEANDRO VILLARIÑO  AND  EULALIO PEÑA, DEFENDANTS  AND APPELLANTS.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Juan L. Villariño and Eulalio Peña,  the appellants in this case, were convicted of the  crime of conspiracy, as defined and penalized in section 4  of Act  No. 292 of the Philippine  Commission,  and  sentenced  the first to  five years7 imprisonment with hard labor and P4,000 fine, and the second  to  four  years' imprisonment with  hard labor and $3,000 fine, respectively, and both to suffer the subsidiary imprisonment prescribed in the Penal Code in case of failure to pay fines imposed in criminal proceedings, and to the payment of their proportionate share of the costs.</p>
<p>The evidence introduced at the trial, including the confession of Juan L. Villariño, and various papers and documents proven to have  emanated from  him, corroborated by the testimony of several witnesses,  fully sustains  the finding of guilt as to him, and we find no prejudicial error in  the  proceedings leading up to the imposition of sentence.  The court erred, however, in imposing subsidiary imprisonment in case of failure to pay the fine, there being no provision  for  such imprisonment in the act of  the Commission defining and penalizing the crime of which he was convicted.</p>
<p>We do not think the evidence of record is sufficient to sustain a finding of guilt as to his co-accused, Eulalio Peña. There is no evidence whatever connecting him with  the conspiracy in which it is alleged he took part, except only an  alleged confession which he is said  to  have  signed in one of the police stations of the city of Manila.  In view of the circumstances under which this alleged confession is said to have been made, and in view, furthermore, of the form  and manner in which it is  drawn  up, we are not prepared to approve a finding of guilt based solely thereon, uncorroborated by any testimony  connecting the accused with  the crime  which  he is alleged  to  have committed. A document was introduced at the trial purporting  to be a commission appointing the said Eulalio Peña brigadier-general of the armed forces which it is alleged the conspirators were organizing, but there is no evidence whatever to show that  Peña ever received  or accepted  such appointment, or in  fact knew of its existence.  The  prosecution attempted to connect him  with  this document  by introducing evidence  to show that one Ladislao Luna, near whose house the said document was discovered, and who himself was charged  with being a member of the conspiracy, had stated that this commission, together with certain  other papers and documents,  had been entrusted to him by Peña for safe-keeping.  This evidence, however, Was entirely inadmissible, as  hearsay, Luna himself not having been put on the stand.</p>
<p>The judgment and sentence of the trial court, in so far as it relates to Juan Leandro Villariño, is hereby affirmed, except in so far as it attempts to impose upon him subsidiary imprisonment, as to which said judgment and sentence is reversed, and the judgment and sentence in so far as it applies to the said Eulalio Peña is reversed, and the said Eulalio Peña is hereby acquitted, and will be set at liberty forthwith.</p>
<p>The said  Juan  Leandro  Villariño  will pay his  proportionate share of the costs of this appeal, those of Eulalio Peña being declared <em>de oficio</em> in both instances. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J.,  Torres, Mapa, Johnson,</em> and <em>Willard, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
