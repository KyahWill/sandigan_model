				<H3>TEODORO R. YANGCO, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE,  VS. THE  CITY OF MANILA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.

				<BR><STRONG>TRENT, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The plaintiff, Teodoro R. Yangco, is the owner of a parcel of land&nbsp; in the district of Santa Cruz,&nbsp; city of&nbsp; Manila, now known to contain 4,243.63 square meters.&nbsp;&nbsp; For the period of six years, from&nbsp; 1901&nbsp; to 1906, inclusive, this land was assessed for&nbsp; taxation purposes in the&nbsp; same manner as all other lots in that section&nbsp; of the city; that is to say, a certain value per square meter was ascribed to the land, according to its location, and that value was multiplied by the number of square meters of its area to give the total assessed value of the parcel.&nbsp; During these six years this parcel of land was assessed on the basis that it contained 6,610 square meters.&nbsp; After 1906, and&nbsp; for&nbsp; all succeeding&nbsp; assessments, the area of this lot was fixed at 4,243.63 square meters.<br><br>The appellee paid during the six years from 1901 to 1906, inclusive, the sum of $4,747.78 U. S. currency as taxes on this lot on the basis that it contained 6,610 square meters. If it had been assessed at&nbsp; the same&nbsp; rate per square meter on the basis that it contained only 4,243.63 square meters, then&nbsp; he would have paid&nbsp; $3,555.17&nbsp; U. S. currency.&nbsp; He now seeks to recover $1,192.61 U. S. currency, the difference between these two amounts.&nbsp; Judgment was&nbsp; rendered in his favor by one of the courts of the city of Manila for this amount, and the city appealed.<br><br>Section 46 of Act No. 183 (the Manila Charter), under which the land in question was assessed for taxation, provides:<br><blockquote>"*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; It shall be the duty of every owner of real estate in the city of&nbsp; Manila to prepare,&nbsp; or&nbsp; cause to be prepared, a&nbsp; statement&nbsp; of the amount of land&nbsp; and the improvements&nbsp; thereon which he&nbsp; owns, the&nbsp; annual rent or income received by him from&nbsp; each&nbsp; piece&nbsp; of his property for each of the three years preceding the statement, and a description sufficiently&nbsp; in detail to enable the city assessor and collector to identify the same on&nbsp; examination."<br></blockquote>This section further&nbsp; provides that&nbsp; the owner, or his duly authorized&nbsp; agent,&nbsp; shall verify&nbsp; such&nbsp; statement and&nbsp; swear to the same before any officer authorized by law to administer oaths, and file the&nbsp; same with the city&nbsp; assessor and collector on or before the 1st day of&nbsp; September, 1901.<br><br>Printed forms were&nbsp; prepared to aid the owners of real property in&nbsp; declaring&nbsp; their property for assessment,&nbsp; and according to these printed forms the owner&nbsp; stated that such real property contains so many&nbsp; square meters more or less. He then proceeded to give the description and value of the same.<br><br>In the case at bar the appellee prepared his&nbsp; declaration for assessment, in which he set forth, under oath, that the parcel of land in question contained 6,610 square meters, and according to the form made out by him he placed a certain money value upon this property, giving a detailed description of the same, and it was upon this sworn declaration of the appellee that the taxes were assessed and collected for the six years.&nbsp; No objection was&nbsp; made&nbsp; to the payment of these taxes at any time during this period.&nbsp; It&nbsp; was not until after the city had surveyed this lot and&nbsp; found that it contained&nbsp; only 4,243.63 square&nbsp; meters that the appellee moved in the&nbsp; matter.&nbsp; On discovering the difference&nbsp; in the area of this lot he demanded&nbsp; of&nbsp; the city assessor and collector the refund of $1,192.61 U. S. currency.&nbsp; The matter was referred to the municipal board and denied.&nbsp; The appellee then instituted&nbsp; this action in the Court&nbsp; of First Instance.<br><br>The appellee admits that there is&nbsp; no express provision of the tax law providing for the correction&nbsp; of&nbsp; any&nbsp; errors whatsoever in the assessment roll, but insists that it is a well-established doctrine&nbsp; of quasi&nbsp; contract,&nbsp; to&nbsp; which the city&nbsp; of Manila&nbsp; is&nbsp; as&nbsp; thoroughly&nbsp; amenable&nbsp; as&nbsp; any&nbsp; other person, that money paid&nbsp; and received under a mutual mistake of fact must be returned.<br><br>"Taxes are not contracts between party and party, either express or implied; but&nbsp; they&nbsp; are&nbsp; the positive&nbsp; acts of the Government,&nbsp; through its various agents, binding upon the inhabitants, and&nbsp; to the&nbsp; making and&nbsp; enforcing of&nbsp; which their&nbsp; personal&nbsp; consent,&nbsp; individually,&nbsp; is&nbsp; not&nbsp; required." (Cooley on Taxation, Vol. 1, page 19, citing: Johnson<i> vs.</i> Howard, 41 Vt., 122; Pierce <i>vs</i>. Boston, 3 Met., 520; Morris <i>vs</i>. Lalaurie, 39 La. Ann., 47; Hibbard<i> vs</i>. Clark, 56 N. H., 155; Webster<i> vs.</i> Seymour, 8 Vt, 135; Finnegan <i>vs</i>. Fernandina, 15 Fla., 379; Edmonson <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Galveston, 53&nbsp; Tex., 157; Perry <i>vs</i>. Washburn, 20 Cal., 318; De Pauw <i>vs</i>. New Albany, 22 Ind., 206;&nbsp; Jones <i>vs.</i> Gibson, 82 Ky., 561.)<br><br>A&nbsp; taxpayer is bound by a description which he himself has furnished.&nbsp;&nbsp; (San&nbsp; Francisco <i>vs</i>.&nbsp; Flood,&nbsp; 64&nbsp; Cal., 504; Lake County <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Sulphur&nbsp; Bank,&nbsp; 68 Cal,&nbsp; 14;&nbsp; Dear <i> vs.</i> Varnum,&nbsp; 80 Cal.,&nbsp; 86;&nbsp; Jeffries <i>vs</i>. Clark,&nbsp; 23&nbsp; Kan., 448; Hubbard <i>vs.</i> Winsor, 15 Mich., 146;&nbsp; Sage <i>vs</i>.&nbsp; Burlingame, 74 Mich., 120.)<br><br>The plaintiff and appellee, Teodoro R. Yangco, stated in his sworn declaration that&nbsp; his lot contained 6,610 square meters.&nbsp; This was&nbsp; accepted by the&nbsp; city&nbsp; and&nbsp; taxes were collected accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; appellee is presumed to know better than anyone else the size of&nbsp; this lot.&nbsp; He allowed&nbsp; the city to collect the taxes&nbsp; on the basis that this lot contained the number of square&nbsp; meters stated by him for a&nbsp; period of six years without moving in the matter, or calling, in any way,&nbsp; the&nbsp; attention of the city authorities to the error. He can not, we think, after this long silence and negligence, under all the other facts and&nbsp; circumstances in this case, compel&nbsp; the city&nbsp; to&nbsp; refund&nbsp; this difference.&nbsp; We&nbsp; base our conclusion upon the facts presented in this particular case without attempting to&nbsp; establish any general doctrine with reference to the refund&nbsp; of taxes paid.<br><br>The judgment appealed from is, therefore, reversed, without any special ruling as to costs.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J,, Torres, Johnson,</i> and <i>Moreland, JJ.</i>, concur.<br></div>
