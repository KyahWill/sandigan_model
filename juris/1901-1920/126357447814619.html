				<H3>LUIS SANTOS, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. SILVESTRE DILAG, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.

				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On or about the 5th day of October, 1904, the defendant executed a notarial document in which he stated that he had borrowed of the plaintiff 6,000 pesos, which he promised to pay within forty days  from the date of said document, and to secure the  payment thereof mortgaged a certain fishery  then  belonging to  him.  When  sued  upon  this agreement, he alleged that he had never borrowed anything from the plaintiff but that the amount stated in the instrument was money won by  the plaintiff from the defendant at  the game  of <em>monte</em>.   The court below held that the evidence did not sustain  this claim of  the defendant and entered judgment against him.  He moved for a new trial on the ground of the insufficiency of the evidence, and has brought the case here by bill of exceptions.</p>
<p>The only question presented is one of fact.  In support of the claim of the plaintiff that the 6,000 pesos represented a loan, there was the evidence of the plaintiff himself and of Jose" Escalante and Felipe Zamora, persons who, according to the defendant, participated in the game with him and the plaintiff.  These witnesses denied any  such participation.  There  was  also the testimony  of Fabian de Castro, who stated  that he loaned the plaintiff 2,500 pesos to loan to the defendant and that he witnessed the delivery of the 2,500  pesos  by the plaintiff to the defendant.  In support of the defendant's contention there is his own testimony and the testimony of Margarita Dilag, Macario Santa Ana,  Pedro Oapiral, and Ambrosia  Santiago.  The testimony of the  witnesses for  the defendant in regard to the gambling  is directly contradicted by the testimony of the witnesses  for the plaintiff.   Under such circumstances we can not reverse  the decision of the trial court.  In  order to enable  us  to do so, it must appear that the evidence is plainly and manifestly against that decision.   (De la Rama vs.  De la Rama,  201 TJ. S., 303.)   That does not appear in this case.</p>
<p>At  the trial Jose Escalante, a witness for the plaintiff, testified that he never engaged in any  kind of gambling. In order to impeach the credibility of this witness, the defendant offered  in evidence the record of another  case formerly pending in the Court of First Instance of Manila, in which it appeared that Escalante had been engaged in a game of <em>monte</em>.   It seems that this evidence  was rejected by the court below,  and  that ruling is assigned as error by the appellant. A reading of all the testimony of Escalante makes it plain  that he misunderstood  the question that was asked him  and did not intend to say that he never gambled in any  way, for on the next page of his evidence he states that lie was accustomed to attend horse races and bet upon  the events.  Even if this record had  been admitted it could not in any way have changed the result, and the error in rejecting it, if there was any, was error without prejudice.</p>
<p>The judgment of the court below  is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.</p>
<p>After expiration of twenty days let judgment be entered in accordance herewith, and ten days thereafter  let the record be remanded to the court below for proper action. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa,</em> and <em>Carson, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em>Tracey, J.,</em> concurs in the result.</p>
