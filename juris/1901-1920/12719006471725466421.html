<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MORELAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The defendant, Pedro Martinez,&nbsp; some time during the year 1908 obtained judgment in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila against one Maria&nbsp; Aniversario; that thereafter execution&nbsp; was issued upon said judgment and the sheriff levied upon a <span style="font-style: italic;">pailebot, Tomasa</span>, alleged to be the property&nbsp; of said&nbsp; Maria Aniversario; that thereupon the said defendant Go Juna intervened and claimed a lien upon said boat by virtue of a pledge of the same to him by the said Maria Aniversario made on the 27th day of February, 1907, which said pledge was evidenced by a&nbsp; public instrument bearing that date.<br><br>This action was brought by the sheriff against Go Juna and&nbsp; Pedro Martinez to determine the rights of the parties to the funds in&nbsp; his&nbsp; hands.&nbsp; Maria Aniversario was not made a party.<br><br>The said Pedro Martinez alleged&nbsp; as a defense that the pledge which said document was intended to constitute had not been made effective by delivery of the property pledged, as required by article&nbsp; 1863&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Civil Code, and&nbsp; that, therefore, there existed no preference in favor of said Go Juna.<br><br>The court below found with&nbsp; the contention of the&nbsp; said Pedro Martinez,&nbsp; declared a preference&nbsp; in his favor,&nbsp; and ordered the sheriff to pay over the said funds in consonance therewith.&nbsp; An appeal was taken from said judgment.<br><br>The conclusion of the court below&nbsp; that the&nbsp; property&nbsp; was not delivered in accordance with the provisions of article 1863 of the Civil Code is sustained by the proofs.&nbsp; His conclusion that the&nbsp; pledge was ineffective&nbsp; against Martinez is correct.&nbsp; It appears, however, that&nbsp; the&nbsp; document of pledge is&nbsp; a&nbsp; public document which contains&nbsp; an&nbsp; admission of indebtedness.&nbsp; In other words, while it is intended to be a pledge, it is also a<i> credit which appears in a public document </i>&nbsp; Article 1924, paragraph 3, letter <i>a,</i> is therefore applicable; and, said public document antedating the judgment of defendant Martinez, takes&nbsp; preference thereover. The&nbsp; validity of that document in so far as it shows an indebtedness against Maria Aniversario and its effectiveness against&nbsp; her have not,&nbsp; however, been determined.&nbsp;&nbsp; She is not a party to this action.&nbsp;&nbsp; No&nbsp; judgment can be rendered affecting her rights or liabilities under said instrument.&nbsp; If said instrument is invalid or for any other cause unenforceable against her,&nbsp; it would be wholly unjust, by&nbsp; declaring its preference over a debt acknowledged by and conclusive against her, to require that said funds&nbsp; be paid over to the holder&nbsp; of said document.&nbsp; That&nbsp; would be to&nbsp; require her to pay&nbsp; a debt&nbsp; which&nbsp; has not only not been shown to be enforceable against her but which, as a witness for the defendant Martinez on the trial of this&nbsp; cause, she expressly and vehemently repudiated as a valid claim against her.<br><br>The judgment&nbsp; is, therefore, reversed;&nbsp; and it is ordered that the&nbsp; cause be&nbsp; returned to the court below; that the plaintiff&nbsp; bring in&nbsp; Maria&nbsp; Aniversario&nbsp; as&nbsp; a&nbsp; party to&nbsp; this action,&nbsp; and that she be given an opportunity to make her defense, if she have any, to the document in question under proper procedure.&nbsp; No finding as to costs.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Johnson,</i> and <i>Carson, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
