				G.R. No. 3808, October 18, 1907</h4>
				<H3>THE  UNITED  STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. JACINTO VICTORIA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Jacinto  Victoria, as the  clerk of  the firm of Bryan, Landon &amp;  Co., made some repairs to an electrical installation at the house of Pedro de la Cruz, for the sum of P30, which was the price agreed  between them, Victoria and Cruz, according to the testimony of  the latter.  Jacinto Victoria stated to the firm that the price agreed upon was P10, and the bill  against Pedro de la Cruz was made out for the latter sum.   But Pedro de la Cruz finally received a bill for P30  from the firm, which the latter had signed, the "1" having been transformed into a "3" and another handwritten "P."  was placed over the sign "P," which was typewritten, and he paid the P30.   The firm, however, received but P10 from Victoria, who was the person who presented the  bill  for collection,   'Subsequently the firm became aware that the bill had been altered and that P30 had been paid for the materials and labor, out of which they  only  received  P10,  as  already stated above; hence the reason for  the filing of the complaint.   The alteration discovered was very roughly made on the bill and the same appears on record.</p>
<p>The accused  testified  that he had  no authority from Bryan, Landon &amp; Co. to enter into  contracts for an installation without previously consulting the company in respect of the price, which in the present case had been contracted for P10 with  Pedro de la Cruz, and that he had presented to the latter a bill  for P10, and that P10 was the sum he paid to the company.</p>
<p>The following  facts have been proved: (1) The alteration made on the private document in question; (2) the status of the accused, Jacinto  Victoria, as clerk of the firm of Bryan, Landon &amp; Co.;  (3) the receiving of the P30 by the latter as such clerk and handing over to his principal  but P10, the same which he previously and deceitfully said was the price agreed with Pedro de la Cruz; and (4)  that the author  of  the alteration  made by substituting the figure "1" by the figure "3" so that "30" appeared in lieu of "10,"  and thus  to profit to the extent of P20, is no other than the accused.</p>
<p>Therefore, the court below did not err in convicting the accused as guilty of the crime of falsification of a private document.</p>
<p>Nor did  the  court err in considering that the crime of falsification of a private  document had been committed, notwithstanding the fact  that the  appellant alleges that no loss was incurred either by the firm of Bryan, Landon &amp;  Co.,  who received what they expected to  receive, or by Pedro de la Cruz, who paid what he  had agreed to  pay; the  crime was  committed from the fact that  the  agent deceitfully and fraudulently collected more  money than his  employer had authorized him  to  collect  either prior to commencing  the work or after it was completed, when the voucher for  the amount due was issued, which voucher was altered in order to accomplish  his purpose.   He who, being merely an employee  of a mercantile firm, as in  the present case, enters into a  contract in  the line of business carried on by his employer and for account, and risk of the latter, is not entitled to receive for himself  any amount whatever by reason of his services in connection therewith, as he would otherwise be entitled to do if he worked  for his own personal account and risk, and  had contracted with a'firm like Bryan, Landon &amp; Co. to supply the materials, and  with another person,  as in the case of Pedro  de la Cruz, to do work for him in the installation of an electric plant.</p>
<p>The fact of an agent informing  his employer that  the price for the installation  was P10, and the  other  interested party that the  price was P30, afterwards altering the former's bill in order to collect a larger sum  from  the latter, in pursuit  of  his fraudulent purpose  involves  the characteristics  of the  crime of <em>estafa</em>, besides  that  of falsification,  which was employed as a means to an end, because by adopting deceitful tactics lie obtained a price which he would  not have secured by telling the truth.</p>
<p>The accused is therefore  guilty of the crime of falsification  of a private document with prejudice to a third person, both because of  the discredit  caused to his employer and for the gain  which he unduly obtained from another by means of the document issued by the former, subsequently falsified  as to the amount to be paid  for the work.   No distinction is made in article 304 of the Penal  Code  between parties prejudiced nor does it stipulate which shall bear the loss.</p>
<p>The  complaining witness  alleges in  his  information "that the accused appropriated to himself P20, which were part of the P30  paid him by Pedro de  la Cruz, which sum of P30 it was the duty of the accused to deliver to Bryan, Landon &amp; Co. as paid by Pedro de la Cruz for the installation of ten lights made by Bryan, Landon &amp;, Co., but the complaining  witness himself says at the end thereof, "all  to the damage and prejudice of Pedro de la Cruz in the sum of P20."</p>
<p>Owing  to the status of the accused, the mitigating circumstances  of  article  11 can  not  be taken  into consideration.</p>
<p>Consequently, the penalty imposed by article 304 of the Penal  Code being applicable, without either aggravating or extenuating circumstance to be  considered,  we hereby sentence Jacinto Victoria to one year eleven months and twenty-one days of <em>presidio correcciona</em>l and a fine of 625 pesetas, to the  accessories thereof, to make restitution of P20  to Pedro de  la Cruz, and to pay the costs in both instances.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Johnson, Willard,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
