				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">About dark in the evening of February 15,&nbsp; 1910, Pedro C. Lopez, Mateo Navarro, Teofilo Osorio, and Carlucio Alban entered the store of Dy-Yong, situated within the jurisdiction of the municipality of&nbsp; Dalaguete, Province of Cebu, and, after having entered this store, Lopez told the Chinaman, Dy-Yong, that he, Lopez,&nbsp; was&nbsp; an internal-revenue agent, and at the same time exhibited his badge.&nbsp; Immediately thereafter Lopez, assisted by Navarro, commenced to search the store, and after having examined the contents of certain boxes they pretended&nbsp; that&nbsp; they had found&nbsp; a small quantity&nbsp; of&nbsp; opium concealed in one of the boxes. The Chinaman denied the ownership of this opium,&nbsp; stating that he knew absolutely nothing about its being in that box. The accused and his&nbsp; companions then threatened to arrest this Chinaman and take him to the municipality on a charge of violating the&nbsp; Opium Law.&nbsp; The Chinaman protested his innocence and showed signs of refusing to submit&nbsp; to arrest. At that moment Navarro and Alban&nbsp; drew their&nbsp; revolvers and pointing them at the&nbsp; Chinaman&nbsp; told&nbsp; him to follow them.&nbsp; At this moment Lopez proposed to release the Chinaman and not report this charge against him if he would give them P400.&nbsp; The Chinaman&nbsp; could not&nbsp; pay this amount because he did not&nbsp; have&nbsp; the money, but he&nbsp; did pay Lopez the sum of P60&nbsp; on&nbsp; condition that they would&nbsp; release him. After Lopez had received this sum they refused to&nbsp; release him but forced him to accompany them in the direction of the municipality.&nbsp; When but a short distance from&nbsp; the Chinaman's store, and in&nbsp; front of the house of one Santiago Caren, some one proposed that they enter Santiago's house. They did this and after having a talk with Santiago, Lopez again proposed to the Chinaman that they&nbsp; would release him&nbsp; on&nbsp; payment of P340 more.&nbsp; After considerable discussion they finally agreed to release him on&nbsp; condition that he pay them P200, which&nbsp; the Chinaman did,&nbsp; making in all P260 received by Lopez.<br><br>Subsequent to the commission of these acts Lopez, Navarro and Osorio were tried by the Court of First Instance of the Province of Cebu for the crime of robbery.&nbsp; Carlucio Alban&nbsp; was&nbsp; excluded from the&nbsp; complaint and used&nbsp; as a witness for the&nbsp; prosecution,&nbsp; Osorio&nbsp; was&nbsp; acquitted,&nbsp; and Lopez and Navarro were each&nbsp; sentenced to three years, eight months,&nbsp; and on&nbsp; day of <i>presidio correccional</i>, to the corresponding accessory penalties, to indemnify the offended party, Dy-Yong,&nbsp; in&nbsp; the sum of&nbsp; P260, to suffer the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to&nbsp; pay one-third of the costs.&nbsp; They appealed.<br><br>During&nbsp; the&nbsp; pendency&nbsp; of this&nbsp; case in this court Mateo Navarro&nbsp; withdrew&nbsp; his&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; and&nbsp; is&nbsp; now&nbsp; serving his sentence.<br><br>It has been&nbsp; established beyond any question of doubt that this robbery was&nbsp; committed in&nbsp; the&nbsp; manner above set forth.&nbsp;&nbsp; The judgment&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from being in accordance with the law and the&nbsp; merits of the case, same&nbsp; is hereby affirmed, with the corresponding amount Of costs&nbsp; against the appellant.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i> Arellano, C.&nbsp; J., Mapa, Carson,&nbsp; </i>and <i> Moreland, JJ.</i>, concur.<br></div>
