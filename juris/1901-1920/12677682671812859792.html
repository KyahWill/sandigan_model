				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an action to recover damages alleged to have been caused by the 
malicious attachment and levy by the defendant upon the goods, wares, and 
merchandise of the plaintiff.
<p>The plaintiff alleged "that since 1903 the said plaintiff was a merchant 
conducting a general business in the town of Liloan and in other parts of Leyte; 
that his business was large and his credit good and extensive; that in February 
and April, 1905, and again for a third time in February, 1906, the defendant had 
the local sheriff attach the plaintiff's store and all the stock therein, 
<em>although plaintiff was in no way a party to the action."</em> "All three 
attachments were released within from one week to four months after each levy. 
The effect of them, however, was to ruin plaintiff's business and destroy his 
credit, for which he asked damages in the sum of P20,000."<br><br>In the brief 
it is stated: "This first levy was a preliminary attachment and took place 
February 18, 1905/ Appellant on March 22, 1905, in the same case but by virtue 
of a writ of execution against Jose Garrido, was levied on again by the same 
deputy sheriff, Eustaquio Rafols, Gervacio Mangle, acting president, Carlos D. 
Lizardi, of Artadi &amp; Co., and Antonio Eiguran, also of Artadi &amp; Co. This 
levy was on the entire store and business of appellant, the same, as a result 
thereof, being entirely closed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Claim was immediately made to the sheriff in Tacloban by appellant for the 
store and goods, and, upon Artadi &amp; Co. refusing to file an indemnity bond, 
the attached goods and premises were restored to appellant in the latter part of 
March, 1905.</p>
<p>"It should be noted here that this delivery back to appellant was because of 
his sworn representations and claim of ownership of the property.</p>
<p>"After the return of his goods and the reopening of his store, appellant 
continued his business, when, on the 22d of February, 1906, the store was once 
again attached and closed up by virtue of an order of execution in the same case 
as before. This levy was made by the same deputy sheriff, the municipal 
president of Liloan, and Antonio Eiguran and Carlos de Lizardi, managers of 
Artadi &amp; Co. The defendant's agents took active part in directing the 
attachment.</p>
<p>"As a result of this attachment the store remained closed for two months. Ly 
Jinco, partner of Chita Doc De, presented his claim to the sheriff for the 
attached premises, and Artadi &amp; Co. refusing to file a sheriff's indemnity 
bond, the premises were restored."</p></blockquote>
<p>From the documentary evidence in the case it appears that some time in the 
latter part of the year 1904 or the early part of 1905 the defendant company 
began an action against Jose Garrido and Fernando Garrido for the recovery of 
about ?35,000 alleged to be due to the plaintiff from the defendants. In that 
action the plaintiff company, in February, 1905, obtained an attachment before 
trial upon the property of the defendants, consisting of a stock of goods in a 
<em>tienda,</em> or a part thereof, supposedly the property of the defendants, 
which is, generally speaking, the subject matter of this action. On the 21st of 
March, 1905, another attachment was made in the same action and on the same, or 
substantially the same, property.</p>
<p>The defendants Jose Garrido and Fernando Garrido desiring to recover 
possession of the property attached, on the 10th of April, 1905, made an 
application to the court in which the action was pending and which had issued 
the orders of attachment, to have them dissolved and the property returned to 
the owners, presenting the proper petition, affidavits, and undertaking to that 
end. On the 14th of April, 1905, the court ordered a dissolution of the 
attachments and the return of the property to Jose and Fernando Garrido.</p>
<p>On the 27th of May there was issued by the deputy sheriff, who had in his 
possession the property attached in February and March, 1905, a paper signed by 
himself and by the plaintiff in this action, Chua Doc De, entitled "In the Court 
of First Instance of Leyte, Artady and Company <em>versus</em> Jose Garrido and 
Fernando Garrido" and denominated "Right of third party to ownership and 
possession presented by the Chinaman Chua Ducly, <em>alias</em> Dia."</p>
<p>This paper reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the municipality of Liloan, May 27, 1905.</p>
<p>"Mr. Gervasio D. Mangle, the municipal president of this pueblo, acting in 
the capacity of sheriff, through deputation, received from Mr. Eustaquio Rafols, 
deputy sheriff, an affidavit made by the Chinaman, Chua Pucly, before the clerk 
of the Court of First Instance of this province. By means of the said affidavit, 
Chua Ducly filed a third party claim to the ownership and possession of various 
goods and merchandise that were attached in the name of the defendant, Jose 
Garrido, by order of the Court of First Instance of this province and which were 
seized on February 18 and March 21 last, by the provincial sheriff in the store 
which the third party, Chua Ducly, conducts in the pueblo above mentioned. The 
affidavit recited that the said goods and merchandise belonged to the affiant, 
Chua Ducly, and that he had been in possession of the same from the time he 
opened the said store to the date of the seizure. In support of his claim he 
presented the industrial tax receipts issued to him by the provincial treasury 
of Leyte on the 16th of March and the 19th of September, 1904, respectively ; 
wherefore, in view of the said claim, pursuant to the provisions of section 442 
of the Code of Civil Procedure now in force, and, furthermore, since the Court 
of First Instance of this province has ordered the dissolution of the attachment 
levied on the property of the defendants Jose Garrido and Fernando Garrido, I 
have deemed it proper to return and deliver to the third party, the Chinaman 
Chua Ducly, <em>alias</em> Dia, under his own responsibility, the merchandise 
which was taken from him on the 18th of February and the 21st of March last, as 
hereinbefore related.</p>
<p>"In witness whereof this certificate is issued, certified under my signature 
and signed by the third party, Chua Ducly.</p></blockquote>
<p align="right">(Signed) "GERVASIO D. MANGLE,<br><em>"Municipal 
President.</em></p>
<p align="right">"CHUA DUCLY."<br>(Signed in Chinese characters.)</p>
<p>The cause against the Garridos went to trial and plaintiff company, on the 2d 
of November, 1905, obtained a judgment against the defendants for the sum of 
P34,736.58. On the 2d of December, 1905, an execution was issued by the court 
against the property of the defendants. This is the only execution found in the 
record. Under this execution the sheriff on February 24, 1906, levied upon and 
seized substantially the same stock of goods and business which had been seized 
under the attachments of February and March, 1905.</p>
<p>In April, 1906, one Tim Ymco (alias Yma) presented to the sheriff who made 
the levy under the execution of December 2, 1905, issued against Jose Garrido 
and Fernando Garrido, a sworn statement alleging that the true and lawful owner 
of the property seized under that execution was a partnership composed of 
Chinese persons, namely, himself and one Chua Doc De (alias Dia) doing business 
under the firm style and name of "Quimzungzing."</p>
<p>From this statement of the case, as it appears from the documentary evidence 
in the record, it is clear that the first two seizures and not the first one 
alone were attachments. </p>
<p>That of March 22, 1905, was not a levy "by virtue of a writ of execution" as 
stated by the plaintiff, but was an attachment levied in the same action and for 
the same purpose as that of February 18 of the same year. No levy could have 
been made under an execution at that time because a judgment was not obtained in 
the action against Jose Garrido and Fernando Garrido until the 2d of November, 
1905, and no execution was issued thereon until December 19 of the same year. 
The first levy under an execution was made on the 6th of February, 1906.</p>
<p>It should be noted also that it is very doubtful if the delivery of the 
property thus attached to the appellant was "because of his sworn 
representations and claim of ownership of the property" as claimed by the 
plaintiff. It should be remembered that both attachments were made in the same 
action, and upon parts of the same stock of goods and business. According to the 
documentary evidence in the case, as we have seen, the defendants in that action 
made an application to the court after the second attachment had been made for a 
release of the property from said attachments and the return thereof to them, 
they alleging that said property belonged to them and was in their possession at 
the time of the attachment. They offered a bond for the safe custody of the 
property pending the determination of the action. It is to be assumed that the 
plaintiff was notified of this application, and it would seem that, if Chua Doc 
De and Tim Ymco were the owners of the property, they themselves would have 
known of the seizure under the two attachments referred to and would have 
appeared in the action for the purpose of obtaining release of the two 
attachments upon the ground that the property belonged to them or to the firm of 
which they claimed to be partners. No such appearance, however, was made and the 
court issued an order dissolving the attachments and ordering the return of the 
property to Jose and Fernando Garrido. It should be noted that the order of the 
court dissolving the attachments required the giving of <em>two</em> bonds, one 
of P35,000 and the other of P17,500. The order is a typewritten order and was 
originally drawn so as to require the giving of <em>one bond only</em> and that 
for P35,000. After it had been typewritten, however, and at the time of the 
granting of the order of the 14th of April, 1905, the court, or someone for it, 
interlined with pen and ink just after the words "a bond in the sum of 35,000 
pesos," these words: "and another for the sum of 17,500 pesos." This would 
indicate that the order was drawn after the first attachment and before the 
second, and, accordingly, provided for the giving of only one bond and that in 
the amount necessary for the dissolution of the first attachment; that, after 
the drawing of the order and before it was granted, the other attachment was 
made, and the order, when granted, providing for the dissolution of both 
attachments, must, as a consequence, provide for the corresponding bond for 
each.</p>
<p>The important thing is that the property seized under both attachments was 
ordered, after a hearing before the court, delivered back into the possession of 
Jose arid Fernando Garrido as their property.</p>
<p>About the time that this was occurring, we find in the record a paper issued 
by the deputy sheriff who had made the attachments, setting out, as will be seen 
from the contents of the document hereinbefore quoted, that one Chua Ducly had 
laid claim to the ownership of the property thus attached and recites that 
"since the Court of First Instance of this province has ordered the dissolution 
of the attachment levied on the property of the defendants Jose Garrido and 
Fernando Garrido, I have deemed it proper to return and deliver to the third 
party, the Chinaman Chua Ducly (<em>alias</em> Dia), under his own 
responsibility, the merchandise which was taken from him on the 18th of February 
and the 21st of March last, as hereinbefore related."</p>
<p>Why property should be returned by the sheriff to Chua Ducly when the court 
had dissolved the two attachments thereon upon the ground that the property 
belonged to Jose and Fernando Garrido it is impossible to say, except upon the 
theory that Chua Duc was either an agent of the Garridos or was connected with 
them in business; and the consent of the Garridos to such delivery can be based 
only on some such assumption.</p>
<p>It is, therefore, important to note that the claim on the part of plaintiff 
and appellant that the delivery of the property "back to the appellant (Chua Doc 
De) was because of his sworn representations and claim of ownership of the 
property" is not altogether borne out by the documentary evidence of the case. 
The property was delivered as much by reason of the dissolution of the 
attachments, and perhaps much more, as by the resolution of the claim of 
ownership by Chua Doc De. .In other words, the documentary evidence in the case 
seems to show that the property in question belonged to the Garridos rather than 
to the plaintiff in this case. This is still more evident when we observe that, 
when the levy was made under the execution issued against Jose and Fernando 
Garrido by Artadi &amp; Co. and the same property already twice attached was 
seized and levied upon, a claim of ownership was put forward not by Chua Doc De 
who, it is claimed, had presented a claim of ownership when the property was 
attached and who is claiming exclusive ownership in this case, but by a 
partnership having the firm style and name of "Quimzungzing." This claim was put 
forward by one Tim Ymco, alleging that he and Chua Doc De were partners in the 
firm just mentioned. This levy, it must be remembered, was upon the same 
property upon which the attachments had been made previously and it is the 
property or substantially the property which was released from the attachments 
by order of the court upon the Garridos giving two bonds conditioned that they 
would take and safely keep the property delivered to them by virtue thereof, so 
that, in the event that Artadi &amp; Co. obtained a judgment against them, it 
would then be subject to levy and sale under execution in favor of said 
company.</p>
<p>This claim on the part of the partnership mentioned having been made and 
Artadi &amp; Co. not having given the bond required by section 451 of the Code 
of Civil Procedure, no sale of the property was made under the execution and the 
levy appears to have been abandoned. There is nothing in the record that shows 
when this occurred. We know that it was made in February, 1906, and that the 
claim was presented by the firm of "Quimzungzing" on the 3d of March 
following.</p>
<p>While the plaintiff testified that he was the owner of the goods, wares, and 
merchandise in question and that no other person had any interest therein, we 
have seen that that fact is disputed by the documentary evidence in the case and 
so seriously that we are left much in doubt as to the good faith and validity of 
plaintiff's pretensions in. that regard. It is incumbent upon the plaintiff to 
prove his ownership, if he recover at all, by a fair preponderance of the 
evidence. Whether the evidence of a plaintiff preponderates or not depends not 
only upon the testimony itself, but upon the character and credibility of the 
witnesses presented to prove it. In this litigation three different persons or 
entities have claimed ownership of the property in question: Jose and Fernando 
Garrido, Chua Doc De (the plaintiff in this case), and the partnership of 
"Quimzungzing." The Garridos claimed the property and presented two undertakings 
conditioned in large amounts for the dissolution of two attachments and the 
return of said property to them. In that proceeding the judge found that they 
were entitled to possession of the property and, after the undertakings were 
filed, ordered it returned to them. About the same time an act of the sheriff, 
found in the record in the form of a receiptand delivery, seems to indicate that 
the plaintiff in this case had put in a claim as owner of the property attached 
and that the sheriff, in delivering the property, delivered it to him. In that 
receipt, however, are also mentioned the attachments levied against the Garridos 
and their dissolution by the court and the order to return the property attached 
to them. Later in the record we found the property being claimed by the firm of 
"Quimzungzing," represented by Tim Ymco, one of the alleged partners thereof, he 
asserting that he and the plaintiff in this case constituted the firm. This 
latter claim of ownership was admitted by the plaintiff in this case and the 
firm appears to have obtained a release of the property in its favor some time 
in April or May, 1906.</p>
<p>In this action, however, and as early as June, 1906, when the complaint was 
filed, we find the plaintiff claiming to be the sole owner of the property, 
without alleging how it ceased to be the property of Jose and Fernando Garrido 
or how it ceased to be the property of the firm of "Quimzungzing."</p>
<p>We are of the opinion that upon the whole case the plaintiff has not 
established his ownership of the property in such a manner as to warrant his 
recovery in this case. If plaintiff has done anything at all in that regard, it 
is to demonstrate that Tim Ymco (<em>alias</em> Yma) has an equal interest with 
him in the property. There can be no question that if the plaintiff has 
established any ownership of the property outside of the Garridos, it is a joint 
ownership between him and his partner. He recognized this clearly toward the 
close of the case and asked that the summons and complaint be amended so as to 
include Tim Ymco as a party plaintiff in the case. This amendment was opposed by 
the defendant upon the ground that it brought a new factor into the case which 
had not been there before and would require, in substance, a relitigation of the 
whole matter. The court took the matter under advisement, but, so far as the 
record shows, never ordered the amendment prayed for. As a necessary result 
there exists a defect of party plaintiff which is fatal to Chua Doc De's 
recovery in this action.</p>
<p>We do not think the evidence warrants the conclusion which appellant draws 
therefrom, namely, that defendant by its agents, servants, or employees took 
sufficient part in the attachments and levy to make the defendant company 
responsible either in trespass or for malicious interference with plaintiff's 
property. When a plaintiff places his execution in the hands of an officer for 
service, he is presumed to intend that no action shall be taken thereunder not 
authorized by the terms of the writ. The sheriff may seize the property of a 
stranger or do any other unauthorized act without thereby creating any liability 
against the plaintiff, because the plaintiff is not presumed to have directed or 
ratified the illegal proceeding. While this presumption may be rebutted and the 
injured party may show in such rebuttal that the plaintiff was a cotrespasser 
with the officer or that he ratified the trespass and thus make him responsible 
for the abuse of the writ, that has not been done in this case by a fair 
preponderance of the evidence.</p>
<p>It not having been shown that the defendant company was a cotrespasser with 
the officer or that it ratified the acts of the sheriff in making the 
attachments and the levy, the charge that it maliciously caused the attachments 
and levy to be made upon the property of the plaintiff falls.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the appellant.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson, Carson,</em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.,</em> 
concur.</p>
