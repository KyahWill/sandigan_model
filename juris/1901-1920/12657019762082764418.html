				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The evidence of record fully sustains the findings of fact by the trial judge 
and establishes the guilt of the accused of the offense of which he was 
convicted beyond a reason able doubt.<br><p><br>It was shown at the trial that the 
accused purchased two tracts of land, one in the year 1908 and the other in the 
year 1909, and that neither of these tracts was at that time listed on the books 
of the provincial treasurer. The accused filed no declaration of ownership of 
these lands until the year 1910, and they were assessed for the first time by 
the municipal council in November of that year, though the valuation was not 
finally determined until February, 1911, when it was definitely fixed by the 
provincial board of tax appeals. Thereafter the accused paid the taxes assessed 
for the year 1911, but paid no taxes for the years 1908, 1909, and 1910, during 
which he had held the land without declaring it for taxation as required by law. 
Early in the year 1911, notices of delinquency relating to the unpaid taxes were 
addressed and mailed to the accused. In April, 1912, the accused took the 
elector's oath, solemnly declaring that at that time he was not delinquent in 
the payment of taxes, although at that time he had paid no taxes on the lands in 
question for the years 1908, 1909, or 1910.</p>
<p>Upon proof of these facts the court below convicted the accused of a 
violation of paragraph 4 of section 30 of the Election Law (No. 1582), in that 
he had "knowingly taken a false oath" before an election officer in relation to 
a material fact in a registration proceeding.</p>
<p>The contention of counsel for appellant would seem to be that at the time 
when the oath was taken no taxes had been lawfully assessed upon these lands for 
the years 1908, 1909, and 1910, and that the notices of delinquency mailed in 
January and February, 1911, were irregular and were not based on a lawful 
assessment.</p>
<p>We find no merit in this contention. There can be no question as to the fact 
that the accused was liable for the payment of the back taxes, and although the 
evidence is not wholly satisfactory as to the regularity of the assessment and 
the delinquency notices, nevertheless we think that in the absence of 
satisfactory proof to the contrary, there is enough evidence in the record to 
sustain a finding that these taxes were duly assessed and the accused duly 
notified of his delinquency early in the year 1911. Moreover, where it appears, 
as it does in this case, that the owner of real estate knowingly and willfully 
neglects to make the declaration of ownership required by law, and thus avoids 
the assessment of his land and evades the payment of taxes for which he was 
justly liable, we are of opinion that he is delinquent in the payment of such 
taxes so as to render him guilty of perjury in the event that he takes the 
elector's oath to the contrary. While one who has duly declared his real estate 
does not become delinquent in the payment of the taxes thereon, so as to render 
him liable to the payment of the penalties prescribed for delinquency, until and 
unless the lands are duly assessed and notice of the amount of the taxes has 
been duly furnished the land owner (U. S. <em>vs. </em>Labadan, 26 Phil. Rep., 
239), this rule does not apply in cases wherein the owner fails to declare his 
property, and thus avoids the listing and valuing of such property for purposes 
of taxation. Under the provisions of section 55 of Act No. 82, when back taxes 
are assessed in such cases "the penalties and interest" are added to the back 
taxes "as if the same had been assessed at the time when they should have been 
assessed."</p>
<p>The judgment entered in the court below convicting and sentencing the 
defendant and appellant should be affirmed, with the costs of this instance 
against the appellant. So ordered.</p>
