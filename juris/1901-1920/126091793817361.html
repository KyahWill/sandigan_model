<p>On the 1st of July, 1884, Isidro de la Rama instituted preparatory proceedings of an executive action  for the recovery of this debt.  The surety, Benedicto, was summoned and on  July 8, 1884, admitted the genuineness of his signature to the  document.  In the  executive action which followed, judgment was  rendered in  favor of De la Rama and  execution was issued and levied upon certain property of Ramos, the principal debtor.  Thereupon, and in 1884, Julian Hernaez intervened in the action, claiming to be the owner of the property levied  upon  under the execution.  This claim of  intervention  was  decided  in favor of Hernaez in 1900.  Benedicto, the surety, was then dead, as was also  Isidro de la Rama,  the creditor.  The heirs of the latter presented a claim for the debt evidenced by this document, in  the  proceedings  for the settlement of the estate of Benedicto.   This claim was disallowed by the committee,  and the  creditor appealed to the Court of First  Instance.  A trial was there had, which resulted in a judgment in favor of plaintiff and creditor for the sum of 14,926.05,  Mexican pesos, and costs.   The  defendant moved for  a new trial on the ground that the judgment was not justified by the evidence, which motion was denied, and he has brought the case here by bill of exceptions.</p>
<p>It is claimed by the appellant that De la Rama extended the  time  of the payment of this  obligation,  and thereby discharged the  surety from liability  thereon.  The debt matured on the 6th day of March, 1883, and no proceedings in court were commenced thereon until  the  1st of July, 1884.  In  the  case  of the Banco Espaiiol  Filipino vs. Donaldson Sim &amp; Co. et al.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> No.  2422, decided the 14th day of December, 1905, this court has  had occasion to consider this question.   In that case the  court said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"El diferir el ejercicio de la accion no implica alteracion en la  eficacia del  contrato, ni modo alguno de responsabilidad por parte del  acreedor.  Es puramente, sin demostracion o prueba  en  contrario, espera, cortesia, lenidad, pasividad, inaccion.   No constituye novacion, porque osta tiene que  ser expresa.  Ni engendra responsabilidad, porque  esta de parte del acreedor,  no puede nacer sino de mora,  y para esta  clase de mora seria  necesaria interpelacion de parte de aquo que se considere  perjudicado con ella.   Para que aquella  espera o  inaccion, de suyo beneficiosa para los obligados, pueda traducirse como perjudicial  para  alguno de estos, es de todo punto necesario que asi se haga entender por  medio de protesta o interpelacidn contra la  demora; sin un acto de esta  naturaleza  sigue siendo lo que es: puramente no hacer por parte del acreedor, lo cual por si solo no es inductivo de responsabilidad."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was no proof in this case to take it out of the rule laid down in the £ase cited.  While there was evidence in the case that  interest had been paid by Ramos prior to July, 1884, yet  there was  no evidence to  show that this interest was paid  in  advance.  Therefore,  in  accordance with the decision in said case of the Banco Español  Filipino vs. Donaldson Sim &amp; Co., such  payment of interest did not constitute an extension of the time for the payment of the obligation.</p>
<p>The defendant presented also, as proof of the granting of such an extension, an  answer  filed  in the executive action in 1885, by the lawyer who represented De la Rama in that suit.  This answer stated that an extension had been granted.  It was not, however, signed by De la Rama, and there was no evidence to show that he authorized the making of that particular statement.  It is therefore not evidence in this case against his heirs.</p>
<p>The defendant also presented a letter Avritten by Ramos in April, 1884, asking for an extension.  No answer by De la Rama to this letter was  presented.   It was a mere request  of Ramos.  No showing being made that  it  was ever granted, it  was not sufficient to prove an extension.</p>
<p>The appellant claims that it was the duty of the creditor to exhaust the property  of Ramos before an action could be maintained against the surety; that the evidence in the case shows that that was not done, and that consequently this action can not be  maintained.  We do  not  find  it necessary to decide whether Ramos had or had  not property out of which the debt could have  been paid, for we think that the terms of  the  contract between the  parties did not impose  upon the creditor the duty of exhausting the  property  of Ramos before proceeding against the surety. The word "mancomunario," used in the contract, has a general as well as  a special meaning.   That in this case it was used in its general  signification is, we think, made plain by other terms of the agreement.  It indicated nothing more than  that Benedicto  was  presented  as  a person why would become obligated with Ramos, but  it was  not intended to  indicate the precise character of the obligation  which he incurred.  This  was,  however, indicated in  that  other phrase of the contract which reads "quien consiente conmigo <em>solidariamente</em> en  caso de insolvencia, en ser estrechado  por el rigor de la ley," etc.   The insertion of this clause  in  the  contract made Benedicto liable as a principal, in  case of the insolvency of Ramos. This insolvency occurred, in our  opinion, either  at the maturity of the obligation, on the 6th day of March, 1883, or at the latest on July 1, 1884, when Ramos, not having paid the debt, judicial proceedings were commenced against him for its collection.  The contention of  the appellant  is that the phrase  "in case  of  insolvency" means that insolvency does not exist until after judgment has been obtained against Ramos, execution issued thereon and returned unsatisfied, because no goods of Ramos could be found upon which to levy.  To give the phrase this meaning would be to render useless and of  no  effect  the word "solidariamente," for if this contention can be sustained, the liability of Benedicto, the surety by virtue of this contract, would be exactly the same as it would have been if this word had been omitted—that is, he would not be bound to pay until all the property of Ramos had been exhausted and a judicial  determination  of this  fact  had been  obtained.  We think the clear meaning of the contract is that in case Ramos did not pay the debt at its maturity he should then  be considered as insolvent, and the liability of Benedicto  as a principal of the obligation would at once arise.</p>
<p>It is suggested  by the appellant in  his brief that as this question of solidarity was not touched upon by the judge in his decision, it can  not be considered upon the appeal. There is nothing in this point.   The question is presented by the pleadings  and the evidence, and the fact that the court below based its  decision in favor  of: the plaintiffs upon other grounds is no reason for saying that additional grounds can not be urged in this court to sustain it.</p>
<p>The judgment of the court below is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant, and after the expiration of  twenty days judgment should be  entered in accordance herewith  and the case remanded to the court below for execution of  said judgment.   So ordered.</p>
