				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The&nbsp; defendant,&nbsp; Eustaquio Simbahan, having been&nbsp; convicted in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Batangas of the crime of larceny, Honorable Mariano Cui presiding, and sentenced&nbsp; to one&nbsp; year and&nbsp; six months <i>presidio&nbsp; correccional</i>, to the corresponding accessory penalties, to return to Prudencia Carandang the&nbsp; sum of P50,&nbsp; with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to the payment of the costs, he appealed.<br><br>On the 18th of May, 1910, Pedro Carandang had in his possession a certain female carabao, the property of Maria Magpantay.&nbsp;&nbsp; Carandang quit work on that day some two or three hours after dark, took the animal to his home, tied it at the back&nbsp; of his house, entered and&nbsp; proceeded to dine.&nbsp; A few minutes after finishing his dinner he went out to look after the <i>caraballa</i> but found that it had disappeared.&nbsp; Being unable to find the animal on that night he, on the&nbsp; following day, notified its owner, and also his uncle, Prudencia Carandang,&nbsp; of the loss of the said animal.&nbsp; The search was continued&nbsp; until the 22d of that month,&nbsp; when Pedro Carandang,&nbsp; Prudencia&nbsp; Carandang, and Ciriaco&nbsp; Carandang met the defendant in&nbsp; the&nbsp; barrio of Aya,&nbsp; municipality of San Juan.&nbsp; After conversing with the defendant at that time they informed him of the loss of the animal and asked his assistance in locating it,&nbsp; offering at&nbsp; the&nbsp; same time to pay him for his services.&nbsp; At first the defendant pretended that he knew nothing about the whereabouts of this animal, but after&nbsp; he and&nbsp; Prudencia had&nbsp; had a secret&nbsp; conversation, he agreed&nbsp; to tell them where the animal was on&nbsp; condition that they give him P50.&nbsp; These parties did not have this amount of money with them at that time, but agreed to return that&nbsp; same day with the money and turn&nbsp; it over to the defendant.&nbsp; So a specific time and place&nbsp; was agreed upon for this second meeting, and in pursuance of this agreement they all returned to the designated&nbsp; place about midnight with the&nbsp; ^50.&nbsp; They found the&nbsp; defendant at that place, which was not near any houses,&nbsp; and on delivering the P50 to him he said: "There it is, at the west of the little forest." He then disappeared and Carandang, with his companions, not being able&nbsp; to see the animal from where they were then standing, went to the place&nbsp; indicated, which was about&nbsp; four brazas distant, and there found the <i>caraballa.</i><br><br>The local authorities were notified&nbsp; of these&nbsp; facts on&nbsp; that same night and the arrest of the&nbsp; defendant followed.<br><br>Counsel for&nbsp; the defendant insists that as no one saw his client steal this&nbsp; animal,&nbsp; the&nbsp; above facts&nbsp; do not constitute such a possession as would warrant a conviction on the presumption that the defendant, in the absence of a satisfactory explanation, was the author of the crime.&nbsp; This court has constantly held that, where stolen property&nbsp; is found within a short time in&nbsp; the possession of the defendant, he is, in the absence of a satisfactory explanation, presumed to be the author of the crime&nbsp; and must be condemned as&nbsp; such. (U. S. <i>vs</i>. Divino, 18 Phil. Rep., 425; and U. S. <i>vs</i>. Caralipio and Fernando, 18 Phil. Rep., 421, and cases cited therein.)<br><br>The word "possession" as used above can not be limited to manual touch or personal custody.&nbsp; One&nbsp; who&nbsp; puts or deposits the stolen&nbsp; property in a&nbsp; place of concealment may be deemed to have such&nbsp; property in his possession.<br><br>The animal in the case at bar was concealed in a&nbsp; little forest.&nbsp; The defendant&nbsp; about 12 o'clock&nbsp; at night pointed out the place where the <i>caraballa</i> was tied and received P50 for so doing.&nbsp;&nbsp; All the facts and circumstances in this case show conclusively that he had possession&nbsp; of said <i>caraballa</i> and fully justify his conviction.<br><br>The judgment&nbsp; appealed from is, therefore, affirmed, with costs against the appellant.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J.,&nbsp; Mapa, Carson,</i> and <i>Moreland, JJ</i>., concur.<br></div>
