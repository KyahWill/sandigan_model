				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The question involved in this particular appeal as considered by this court 
in its first decision was, whether or not the items of costs allowed by the 
lower court were proper items to be taxed as costs, under the facts of the 
record and the law. In our former decision we held that some of such items were 
proper items to be taxed as costs and some were not. We held that under the 
provisions of section 492 of Act No. 190, <span style="font-style: italic;">no costs </span>could be allowed except those 
specified in that section. The lower court was evidently misled by the Spanish 
translation of said section. The English of said section reads: "In an action 
pending in a Court of First Instance, the prevailing party may recover the 
following costs, 'and no others;' " * * * The Spanish translation of said 
section omits the phrase "and no others." That section has been interpreted 
various times and it has been uniformly held that "no other items" of costs 
could be allowed by virtue of the clause "and no others," in that section. 
(Mendiola <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Villa, 15 Phil. Rep., 131; Vargas <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Ross, 15 Phil. Rep., 665; 
Osorio <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Trias, 16 Phil. Rep., 511.)
<p>An "election protest" is an action in the court of first instance and said 
article (492) is applicable in the taxation of costs in such cases. Costs not 
permitted by the statute cannot be taxed. (Mendiola <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Villa, 15 Phil. Rep., 
131.)</p>
<p>Costs are statutory allowances to a party to an action for his expenses 
incurred in the action and have reference only to the parties and the amounts 
paid by them. The costs are the sums prescribed by law; in the absence of a 
statute permitting the taxation of costs, they cannot be allowed. In the absence 
of a statutory provision, each party must pay his own costs. In order to compel 
one party litigant to pay the costs of the other, some statutory authority 
authorizing it must be found. (Hart <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Skinner, 16 Vt., 138 [42 Am. Dec, 500]; 
Noyes <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. State, 46 Wis., 250 [32 Am. Rep., 710]; 7 Ruling Case Law, 780; 
Northern <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Hanners, 121 Ala., 587.)</p>
<p>The courts have no inherent power to tax costs. Costs can only be allowed 
when the statute permits it. Each party, in the absence of a statute, must pay 
his own costs. (Northern <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Hanners, 121 Ala., 587; Williams <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Atchinson, 
etc., Railway Co., 156 Cal., 140 [134 Am. State Rep., 117]; Two Rivers Mfg. Co 
<span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Beyer, 74 Wis., 210.)</p>
<p>All of the questions raised by the motion for a reconsideration were 
considered and decided in the former decision except the one, whether or not an 
appeal lies against the judgment for costs. In answer to that question, it may 
be said that this court has recognized the right to appeal from a judgment for 
costs, when the exception were duly and properly made, in a number of cases. 
(Mendiola <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Villa, 15 Phil. Rep., 131; Vargas <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Ross, 15 Phil. Rep., 665; 
Osorio <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Trias, 16 Phil. Rep., 511.)</p>
<p>Notwithstanding said decisions, the appellee now insists that the right to 
appeal in such cases does not exist.</p>
<p>While the authorities are not in exact harmony upon that general question, we 
think that they all agree that the right to appeal, from a judgment for costs, 
lies, in cases where the law, as in this jurisdiction, fixes the only items of 
costs as well as the amount of the same, which can be taxed. In this 
jurisdiction the court has no authority or right to tax costs against either 
party litigant not allowed by statute. If the court allows items of costs not 
permitted by the law, or disallows items of costs which the law permits, it 
violates the law, and the right to appeal from said judgment, if exceptions are 
properly noted, exists. This, of course, is true only in cases where the right 
to appeal is given in a case in which the costs are taxed. If the lower court is 
given final jurisdiction and the right to appeal does not exist, then, of 
course, a judgment must be final as to every branch of the case, including the. 
costs. In the present case, an exception was duly made to the order allowing the 
costs, and a bill of exceptions was duly presented. (Empire Co. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Bonanza Co., 
67 Cal., 406; Muir <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Meredith, 82 Cal., 19; Yorba <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Dobner, 90 Cal., 337; 
Crane <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Forth, 95 Cal., 88; Williams <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Atchinson, etc., Railway Co., 156 
Cal., 140.)</p>
<p>Costs should be taxed as a part of the judgment appealed from. The objection 
to the costs as taxed should be presented with the appeal and not left for a 
subsequent or separate appeal, so as not to prolong unnecessarily the litigation 
and final conclusion of the action.</p>
<p>For the foregoing reasons, the motion for a reconsideration is hereby denied. 
So ordered.</p>

<p><strong>MALCOLM, J.</strong>, <em>concurring:</em></p>
<p>I agree with so much of the decision as relates to the right to an appeal 
from a judgment for costs in an election case, Since I did not intervene in the 
original decision of this court, concerning the "expenses and costs" which 
should be allowed the successful party in election contests, I reserve my 
opinion on this question.<br></p></div>
