				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The only question presented by this appeal is, whether or not, in an action, 
by different creditors, against the same debtor, the preference, which is 
conceded to the vendor of personal property over the other creditors is measured 
by the value of the goods sold at the time of the sale or, by the amount 
received by the sheriff at the public sale of the same. In other words, for 
example, A and B are common creditors of C. C is insolvent. B obtains a judgment 
and secures an order for the sale of the personal property of C. A presents a 
claim based upon his preference under paragraph 1 of article 1922 of the Civil 
Code. The goods are sold at public auction. A identifies the goods so sold by 
the sheriff as the identical goods sold by him to C upon credit. The value of 
the goods sold by A to C was P165. The amount received by the sheriff was P21. 
Query: To what amount is A entitled in the distribution of the proceeds of the 
sale by the sheriff? P165 or P21 only?
<p>Paragraph 1 of article 1922 of the Civil Code provides that preference shall 
be given, in the case of common creditors of the same debtor "for the amount of 
the sale of personal property which may be in the possession of the debtor 
<em>to the extent of the value of such property."</em> What is the signification 
of the phrase "credits * * * to the extent of the value of such property?" Does 
said phrase mean the value of such property at the time of the sale by the 
creditor to the common debtor, or its value at the time it is sold by the 
sheriff? That personal property is constantly fluctuating in value is a fact 
well recognized. The fact that it was sold on the 1st day of the month for P165 
is not absolute proof that its value on the last day of the month is more than 
P21. And moreover, the vendor, in cases like the present, in order to enforce 
his preference has no right to the return of the identical property. He is only 
entitled to a preference to the extent of the value of such property. The 
merchandise was sold. The vendor thereby lost his title thereto. He is not 
entitled to a return of the merchandise simply because his debt has not been 
paid, in the absence of conditions to that effect. The law gives him the right 
of preference only "to the extent of the value of such merchandise" in the final 
distribution of the assets of the insolvent. We are of the opinion that the 
phrase giving to the vendor a preference "to the extent of the value of such 
property" relates to its value as ascertained by the sheriff's sale of the same 
at public auction. If that is true, then the preference of the plaintiff in the 
present action is not to the extent of the value of the goods at the time he 
sold them, or P165, but to their value at the time of the sale by the sheriff at 
public auction, or P21.</p>
<p>Therefore, the judgment of the lower court giving the plaintiff a preference 
in the amount of P165 is hereby modified; and it is hereby ordered and decreed 
that the plaintiff be given a preference over the P21 in the hands of the 
sheriff, less necessary costs and expense in the sale of said merchandise. With 
said modification, the judgment of the lower court is hereby affirmed, without 
any finding as to costs. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Carson, Street</em>, and <em>Malcolm, JJ</em>., 
concur.</p><em>Araullo, J.</em>, did not take part. <br><br><br>
