				<H3>LUCAS GONZALEZ, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS.  ROSENDO DEL ROSARIO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Prior to the 15th day of July, 1902, Clemente del Rosario was the executor of the wills of Nicolas del  Rosario and 1 fonorata  Valdez.  One Ramon del Rosario,  having commenced an action  against him as such executor, he employed the plaintiff, a lawyer, as his counsel in that case.  The case was tried in the Court of First Instance and judgment entered  in favor  of the plaintiff therein and  against the defendant,  Clemente del Rosario, as  executor aforesaid. The latter gave notice of his intention to appeal  and  a bill  of exceptions was prepared and presented for  that purpose.   On the 15th of July, 1902, however,  Clemente del Rosario died  and the defendant in this case, Rosendo del Rosario, was appointed as the executor of both of these estates.  He at once notified the Court  of First Instance that he did not desire to continue the appeal and, in fact, abandoned  it.   The plaintiff made an application  to the Court of First Instance for permission to continue the appeal in the name  of the widow and minor son of  Clemente del Rosario, who were  interested as heirs and  legatees in the estates of the said Nicolas del Rosario and Honorata Valdez.  The court allowed the appeal to be carried on by the plaintiff in behalf of the persons above mentioned, the case was removed to this  court, was tried herein, and a judgment was entered reversing the judgment of the court below.  (See Ramon del Rosario vs. Clemente del Rosario, 2 Phil Rep., 321.)</p>
<p>The plaintiff has  now brought this action  against  Rosendo del Rosario as executor of the two estates to recover compensation  for his services  as a lawyer in connection with the said  litigation.   He states in his complaint two causes of action, one for services rendered in the Court of First Instance and the other for services rendered upon the appeal.</p>
<p>As to the first cause of action, the case is completely covered by the case  of Escueta rtt. Sy-Juilliong<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> (4 Off. Gaz., 56).   The two cases are almost  identical in their facts.  We held in that case that where a lawver was employed by one administrator in  connection with the affairs of the estate of which he was administrator, and where that administrator afterwards died, no action could be maintained by the lawyer to recover for his services against  the second administrator appointed for the same estate.</p>
<p>As to the second cause Of action, it is very clear that the defendant,  neither in his personal nor representative capacity, can  be made  responsible for the value of  the services rendered by the plaintiff upon the appeal,  lie not only did not employ the plaintiff to carry on the  appeal, but expressly  refused to do so, and did all he could  to prevent the appeal from being taken.  Our opinion in  the case of Rosendo del Rosario vs. Clemente del Rosario and the evidence in this case shows  that the  appeal was prosecuted, not by the defendant, but by other persons.</p>
<p>The judgment  of the  court below is  reversed, and the defendant is acquitted of the complaint with the costs  of the first instance, without prejudice  to  the right of the plaintiff to present his claim for services against the persons who are responsible to him therefor.  No costs will be allowed to either party in this court.</p>
<p>After the expiration of  twenty days let judgment be entered accordingly,  and ten days thereafter  the  case be returned to the lower court for execution.   So ordered.</p>
