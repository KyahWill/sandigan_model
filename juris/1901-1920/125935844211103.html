				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> On September 7, 1899, Don Juan Carballo y Blanco was killed in a camarin on his hacienda in the Province of Negros Occidental by a band  of men armed with rifles and bolos.  Three  days  afterwards the  head  of Don Juan, wrapped in  a  sack  (<em>bayan</em>), was found suspended from the bridge  in the pueblo of Silay.  Upon the outside of the sack was this inscription: "<em>Juan Carballo, hombre pernicioso a la  revolucion.  E. P. D.  (Juan Carballo, a bad man for the revolution. R. I. P.</em>)</p>
<p> Don  Juan Carballo was  killed  by reason  of a  written order issued by a council of war convened by the revolutionary forces then operating in that province. The officer then in  command of  these forces was Luis Ginete.  Before this council of war the defendant acted as judge-advocate. According  to the testimony in this case, the decision of the council  was  that  Don Juan be brought before them for trial.  The charges against him were that he was a spy and guide of the Americans.  The order provided that in case of resistance he should be killed.   This order the defendant delivered to the persons charged with its execution.  There was no attempt made to arrest Don Juan.  He was attacked and killed  without warning.</p>
<p> The defendant was tried for the murder of the deceased and was acquitted.  The provincial fiscal appealed.   In this court  the  Solicitor-General asks that the defendant be discharged on  the ground that he is included in the amnesty of July 4, 1902.  While the defendant has asked us to pass upon the merits of the case, yet he also asks the benefit of the amnesty and has filed here the oath required by the proclamation.</p>
<p> His case is clearly  within its terms. He was participating against the United States in the revolution.   He was acting pursuant to the orders of his superior,  Luis Ginete. The killing of Don  Juan Carballo was an offense of  a political character.  (United States vs. Vicente Villamor, August  29,1902.)  Upon  its  facts the case at bar is practically the same as the case cited.  Under the circumstances we do not feel called upon to decide this case on its merits. Such a decision would involve the determination of questions concerning  the status  of Filipinos engaged  in the revolution, and their liability, civilly and criminally, before the courts for acts committed in the prosecution of that revolution.  These questions  are of such importance that they ought not to be decided in a case where such a decision is unnecessary. The defendant was acquitted below, and a holding that he is included in the amnesty  in no way prejudices his rights.</p>
<p> Therefore, assuming, without deciding, that he is legally responsible for the killing of  Don Juan Carballo, we hold that he is included in the amnesty.   He having filed the oath required thereby, the case is dismissed.</p>
<p> <em>Arellano C. J., Torres, Cooper, Mapa,</em> and <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
