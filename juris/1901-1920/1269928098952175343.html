				<H3>BENITO MUÑOZ, PETITIONER, VS. THE COLLECTOR OF CUSTOMS, RESPONDENT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>MORELAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an application for a writ of habeas corpus presented by Benito Munoz against the Collector of Customs.<p>The facts are stipulated and are as follows:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"1. That one Antonio Muñoz Ting Jian Co was born in China about seventy-five years ago; that he came&nbsp; to&nbsp; the Philippines about sixty years ago, and during his minority; that he has lived in the Philippine Islands continuously for the past forty-seven years, and that if&nbsp; he has been&nbsp; absent at all during any part of the whole period of&nbsp; his residence in said Islands, it has only&nbsp; been for temporary purposes and always with the&nbsp; intention,&nbsp; duly carried out in each instance, of returning shortly to his home in the Philippine Islands; that when the said&nbsp; Antonio Munoz first came to the Philippine&nbsp; Islands, he&nbsp; obtained from the Spanish Government the required license&nbsp; or permission&nbsp; to reside&nbsp; in the said Islands;</p><p>"2. That about fifty years ago the said Antonio Muñoz Ting Jian Co&nbsp; was converted&nbsp; to the Roman Catholic faith. and about the&nbsp; same time he&nbsp; lawfully married a&nbsp; native woman by whom he&nbsp; has had&nbsp; issue;</p><p>"3. That he&nbsp; established his&nbsp; domicile in Camalig,&nbsp; Province of Albay with the intention of residing there; that he has in the course of his residence acquired real and other property; lived in a house&nbsp; of his own, and has been a self-supporting merchant,&nbsp; owning&nbsp; a retail store and having various other investments;</p><p>"4. That Antonio&nbsp; Muñoz Ting Jian Co never registered in any public registry,&nbsp; except it be in this, that in the year 1903 or&nbsp; 1904, he did register&nbsp; under Act No. 702, of the Philippine&nbsp; Commission and now holds&nbsp; certificate of residence 348/29537, issued in&nbsp; Albay; that in public&nbsp; documents of various&nbsp; kinds he&nbsp; has&nbsp; uniformly described himself as a resident of the Philippine Islands;</p><p>"5. That after the death of the first wife of the said Antonio Muñoz&nbsp; Ting Jian&nbsp; Co he was once more lawfully married, his second&nbsp; wife being one Antonia Nacional, a native&nbsp; of the Philippine Islands; that as a result of this second marriage there was born to the said Antonio Muñoz Ting Jian Co, on the 11th day&nbsp; of January, 1880, in the town of Camalig, Province of Albay, one&nbsp; Benito Munoz, the petitioner herein;</p><p>"6. That said Benito Muñoz lived&nbsp; in the&nbsp; Philippine Islands with his father until he attained the&nbsp; age&nbsp; of eleven years, when&nbsp; he departed for China, and there&nbsp; remained until January 16, 1911, when he returned&nbsp; to the Philippine Islands in the&nbsp; steamer&nbsp; Taisang,&nbsp; and sought admission thereto as a native and citizen thereof;</p><p>"7. That before&nbsp; the&nbsp; immigration&nbsp; officers who investigated his right of entry he presented satisfactory proof that he would&nbsp; have returned sooner to the Philippine Islands had&nbsp; it not been for certain financial difficulties, and that he had never intended to expatriate himself and had never taken any active steps to that end;</p><p>"8. That the immigration officers denied the petitioner the right to&nbsp; enter the Philippine Islands solely on the theory that he is an&nbsp; alien of Chinese race&nbsp; who&nbsp; presents none of the required&nbsp; statutory proof&nbsp; that he is a member of the exempt class of Chinese persons;</p><p>"9. That petitioner&nbsp; has now exhausted all administrative remedies available to him&nbsp; in&nbsp; his efforts to be declared&nbsp; a citizen and allowed to enter the Philippine Islands as such;</p><p>"10. That if, under the facts above set forth, Benito Muñoz is, as&nbsp; a matter of&nbsp; law, a citizen of the Philippine Islands, and if a&nbsp; decision&nbsp; of the board of special&nbsp; inquiry, based on such facts, and&nbsp; correctly&nbsp; determining the issue of fact, may be reviewed by this court, on the theory&nbsp; that there has been an erroneous application of law to the facts by the board, then, upon a determination&nbsp; by this court that there has been such erroneous finding as&nbsp; to&nbsp; the law in the present case, the&nbsp; decision of the court should be rendered in favor of the petitioner; otherwise not."</p></blockquote><p>This court has already held in the case of United States <em>vs.</em> Go Siaco (12 Phil. Rep., 490) that a male person born in the Philippine Islands, of a Filipino mother and a Chinese father, said father being domiciled&nbsp; with his permanent home in the Philippine Islands and subject to the jurisdiction&nbsp; of the government thereof, is, prima facie, a citizen of the Philippine Islands; and the fact that he, at the age of 14, went to China and&nbsp; remained there until 1897 when he returned to the Islands where he has since continuously resided, was not sufficient in itself to change his status as a citizen of the Philippine&nbsp; Islands.</p><p>In the case before us the applicant was born in the Philippine Islands&nbsp; of a Chinese father and a Filipino mother in the&nbsp; year 1880.&nbsp; The father lived continuously&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Islands for about sixty years, and acquired&nbsp; considerable real&nbsp; and&nbsp; personal property therein.&nbsp; The&nbsp; applicant lived here&nbsp; until 11 years of age, when he was sent&nbsp; to&nbsp; China, where he remained until January, 1911.&nbsp;&nbsp; On this date he returned to the Islands asserting that he was a native&nbsp; and citizen thereof, and with the bona fide intention of making this his permanent home and country, but was denied entry "solely&nbsp; on the theory that&nbsp; he&nbsp; is an alien&nbsp; of Chinese&nbsp; race who present none of the required&nbsp; statutory proof that he is a&nbsp; member of the exempt class of Chinese persons."</p><p>These considerations, taken in&nbsp; connection&nbsp; with paragraph 7 of the stipulation&nbsp; of facts in which it is admitted "that before the&nbsp; immigration officers who investigated his right of&nbsp; entry&nbsp; he presented&nbsp; satisfactory&nbsp; proof that&nbsp; he would have returned sooner to the Philippine Islands had it not been for certain financial&nbsp; difficulties, and that&nbsp; he never intended to expatriate himself and had never taken active steps to that end.' bring this case clearly within&nbsp; the decision in the case of Go&nbsp; Siaco, above mentioned.</p><p>This ruling is&nbsp; not at variance with the&nbsp; recent case of Lorenzo<em> vs.</em> Collector of Customs (15 Phil. Rep., 559).&nbsp;&nbsp; In that case it appeared that:</p><blockquote><p>"In the&nbsp; present case the applicant left&nbsp; the Philippine Islands when he was about 15 years&nbsp; of age and&nbsp; remained in China until he was 34 years of age. <em>He says himself that&nbsp; he had no intention&nbsp; of returning&nbsp; to&nbsp; the Philippine Islands until the year before he did. return.&nbsp; His mother and his&nbsp; brother&nbsp; say that he&nbsp; married&nbsp; a wife&nbsp; in&nbsp; China. *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; The applicant says that he owned and operated a&nbsp; farm in&nbsp; China; that he was a subject of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Chinese Empire&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *.&nbsp; The applicant testified&nbsp; that he&nbsp; never had any intention of returning to the Philippine Islands until last year."</em></p></blockquote><p>Nor is the decision in conflict with the rules adopted by the Department of State of the United&nbsp; States&nbsp; Government with reference to the loss of citizenship by&nbsp; continued residence abroad.&nbsp; This rule is to the effect that&nbsp; a continued residence abroad&nbsp; for three years,&nbsp; after the&nbsp; attainment of majority, produces a loss of citizenship, unless&nbsp; it is clearly proved&nbsp; that the animus <span style="font-style: italic;">revertendi</span> existed.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Van Dyne on Citizenship, pp. 276,&nbsp; 277; <em>In re</em> Bosque, 1 Phil. Rep., 88.)</p><p>In the case before&nbsp; us the <em>intention to return&nbsp; is admitted, as is also the fact that the return was prevented by&nbsp; circumstances over which the applicant had no control. </em>&nbsp; Under such conditions citizenship is not lost where the&nbsp; stay abroad is&nbsp; not prolonged beyond that shown in the case'at bar, and when there&nbsp; is, in fact, a bona fide return&nbsp; to the native land with the honest intention to make it his permanent home and country.</p><p>The writ is granted and&nbsp; the applicant ordered discharged from custody.</p><p><em>Torres, Mapa, Johnson,&nbsp; Carson</em>, and <em>Trent, JJ</em>., concur.</p></div>
