				<H3>NICOLAS NUÑEZ Y ENRILE, PETITIONER, VS. THE HON. CHAS. A. LOW, RESPONDENT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>TRENT, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an original application made in this court,&nbsp; praying for&nbsp; a writ of&nbsp; <i>certiorari</i>, directing the clerk of the Court of First Instance of the Moro Province to certify to this court for review the entire record of a certain case entitled "The United States of America vs. Edward Dworak," charged with the crime of illegal detention and&nbsp; for a&nbsp; preliminary injunction against the respondent, the Hon. Chas. A. Low, judge of the Court of First Instance for said province, during the pendency of this action.<br><br>The only question presented by the petition at this time is whether or not the petitioner is entitled to a&nbsp; preliminary injunction; that is, whether the facts are sufficient to justify this court in restraining the respondent judge, by the extraordinary equitable remedy of <i>certiorari</i>,&nbsp; from&nbsp; proceeding with that criminal case which is pending before him.<br><br>From the petition presented and the exhibits&nbsp; which form a part thereof the following facts appear:<br><br>In the month of June,&nbsp; 1910, Edward Dworak, Captain of Philippine Scouts, U. S.&nbsp; Army, was stationed and in command of troops at the barrio of Isabela,&nbsp; municipality of Zamboanga, Moro&nbsp; Province,&nbsp; and at the&nbsp; same time acting councilman for said barrio.&nbsp; On the 9th of that month Captain Dworak received from the wife of one Doroteo Saavedra a verbal complaint that she had been&nbsp; illtreated by her husband.&nbsp; Thereupon the captain ordered Saavedra to appear before him.&nbsp;&nbsp; Saavedra declined to obey this order.&nbsp; Captain Dworak&nbsp; then&nbsp; proceeded&nbsp; to&nbsp; Saavedra's house,&nbsp; placed him under arrest, and took him to the captain's office where an investigation was made&nbsp; which was followed by an&nbsp; order given by the captain directing Saavedra to be confined in the local jail or guardhouse for the period&nbsp; of fifteen days and to pay a fine of P15. This order was carried into effect by the troops under the captain's command.&nbsp; After Saavedra had served the fifteen&nbsp; days' confinement and&nbsp; paid the fine he&nbsp; was&nbsp; released.&nbsp; Subsequently thereto and on the 3d of August of the same year the said Saavedra filed in the Court of First Instance of the Moro Province a criminal complaint against&nbsp; Captain Dworak, charging him with the crime of illegal detention.&nbsp;&nbsp; A preliminary examination followed and the Hon.&nbsp; Herbert&nbsp; D.&nbsp; Gale, then&nbsp; judge of the Fourteenth Judicial District, issued on the 16th of December, 1910, an order holding the defendant, Dworak, in the sum of P3,000 to appear before the Court of First Instance to answer said charge.&nbsp; In the same order, and upon his own motion, Judge Gale disqualified Connor,&nbsp; the&nbsp; provincial attorney, and Captain Ansell, assistant provincial attorney, from conducting the&nbsp; prosecution against&nbsp; Dworak,&nbsp; and&nbsp; appointed&nbsp; Nicolas Nunez, a member of the&nbsp; Zamboanga bar and petitioner in the&nbsp; case under&nbsp; consideration, special prosecuting attorney to represent the Government&nbsp; in said criminal case.&nbsp; On or about January 1, 1911, Judge Gale was relieved from duty as judge of the Fourteenth District and appointed judge at large, and Judge Low was&nbsp; transferred to the Fourteenth District.&nbsp; the prosecuting attorney presented&nbsp; on the&nbsp; 27th of December, 1910, a motion asking the court to annul that part of the order of December 16th which disqualified him and&nbsp; his assistant from conducting&nbsp; the prosecution against Dworak.&nbsp; This motion was heard by the respondent judge, who, by order dated January 20,&nbsp; 1911, amended&nbsp; and&nbsp; set aside that part of the order of December 16, 1910,&nbsp; disqualifying Connor and his assistant, and directed them to proceed with the case according to law.<br><br>As to whether or not the&nbsp; Court of First Instance was justified under the&nbsp; facts then before it in issuing the two orders (dated December 16, 1910, and January 20, 1911), we can&nbsp; not and do&nbsp; not now determine.&nbsp;&nbsp; The only question before us at this time&nbsp; is one of law; that is, did the court exceed its jurisdiction in issuing the annulling order?&nbsp; The determination of this question necessarily involves&nbsp; the&nbsp; validity of the order of December 16.&nbsp; This order was based upon the provisions of section&nbsp; 11 of Act No. 83, as amended by section 1 of Act No. 223, section 1 of Act No. 1443, and section 1 of Act No. 1699, which section, as thus amended, provides:<br><blockquote><center><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></center><br>"Whenever the provincial fiscal is absent from the province, or fails or refuses to e his duty by reason of illness&nbsp; or other cause, or by reason of personal interest in a prosecution or other matter is disqualified to act therein as provincial fiscal, the judge of the Court of First Instance for&nbsp; the province is&nbsp; authorized and&nbsp; required to appoint a temporary fiscal, who shall be paid out of the provincial <br>treasury the same compensation per day as that&nbsp; provided by law for the regular provincial fiscal for the days actually employed.&nbsp; The fiscal thus temporarily appointed shall discharge all the duties of the provincial fiscal as provided by law which the regular provincial fiscal&nbsp; fails or is unable to perform.&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*"</blockquote>Judge Low was of the opinion&nbsp; that the above provisions of law&nbsp; are not applicable to the Moro Province and that the court was without authority to suspend the attorney and assistant attorney for that province and appoint a temporary fiscal to represent the Government in that criminal&nbsp; case. In passing upon these questions he said:<br><blockquote>'"The court is of the opinion that Act No. 83 does not apply to the Moro Province, which was established under Act No. 787&nbsp; and which act fully provides how the said Moro Province shall be governed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The entire scheme of&nbsp; government for this&nbsp; province is different from that provided by Act No. 83 for provinces in general.&nbsp; Nowhere in said Act establishing the Moro Province can a provision be found similar to section 11 of Act No. 83, as amended by Act No. 223, conferring on the judge&nbsp; of the Court of First Instance for the province authority to suspend&nbsp; the attorney of the province or the assistant attorney,&nbsp; and 'to appoint a, temporary provincial fiscal,' etc.&nbsp; Moreover there&nbsp; is no such officer in the Moro Province as the provincial fiscal.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is an attorney and an assistant attorney for the&nbsp; Moro Province.&nbsp;&nbsp; The assistant attorneys are empowered to act as district fiscals under the supervision of the attorney for the Moro Province.&nbsp; There is no&nbsp; such officer as the 'provincial fiscal,' referred to in Act No. 83.&nbsp;&nbsp; The powers and duties of the. attorney&nbsp; and his assistants&nbsp; are fully set forth in the Act and it not appearing that the judge of this court have the power or authority conferred on him by law to suspend either of the above-named officers or to appoint a special fiscal to act in these places, that portion of the&nbsp; order is&nbsp; hereby set aside and amended and the information herein signed by Sr. Nicolas Nunez, as special fiscal, ordered stricken from the files, and the attorney for the Moro Province,&nbsp; and his assistants, are directed to proceed in this case according&nbsp; to law."<br></blockquote>It will be noted,&nbsp; that the respondent&nbsp; held that the Court of First Instance of the Moro Province is without authority to appoint, under any circumstances, a temporary prosecuting officer&nbsp; to represent the Government in any criminal cause.&nbsp; In this we&nbsp; think he erred.<br><br>The provincial fiscal shall&nbsp; represent the provincial and Insular governments in his province in all actions or&nbsp; prosecutions in the Court of First Instance in the manner provided by law.&nbsp; "He shall be&nbsp; an&nbsp; officer&nbsp; of&nbsp; the court and subject to officials directions in relation to official matters pending in the Court of First&nbsp; Instance."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Sec. 62, Organic Act No. 136.)<br><br>Act No. 787&nbsp; is "An Act&nbsp; providing for the organization and government of the Moro Province."&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 9 of this Act,&nbsp; as amended by section 2 of&nbsp; Act&nbsp; No, 1699, provides that the provincial attorney shall, when the public interests require it, appear and take charge of the prosecutions for the Government in any court within the province.<br><blockquote>"<i>Who shall prosecute crimes in the Moro Province</i>. - The prosecution of criminal offenses in the Courts of First Instance of Jolo, Bongao, Zamboanga,&nbsp; Cotabato,&nbsp; and Davao, shall be conducted by the provincial&nbsp; attorney for the Moro Province, until the legislative council shall, in its discretion, provide for the appointment of fiscals assigned to assist the provincial&nbsp; attorney in&nbsp; this&nbsp; work in one&nbsp; or more&nbsp; of the districts of&nbsp; the&nbsp; province.&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *"&nbsp; (Sec.&nbsp;&nbsp; 21, Act&nbsp; No. 867.)<br><br>"The prosecution of offenses held in Iligan,&nbsp; in the district of Lanao, and Dapitan, in the subdistrict of Dapitan, of the Moro Province, shall be conducted by the provincial attorney for the Moro Province, or by the provincial&nbsp; fiscal of Misamis, at the request and under the supervision&nbsp; of the provincial attorney for the Moro Province.&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *"&nbsp;&nbsp; (Sec. 22, Act No. 867.)<br></blockquote>The powers and duties of provincial fiscals and the&nbsp; provincial attorney for the Moro Province, with&nbsp; reference to criminal prosecutions,&nbsp; are&nbsp; of the same character.&nbsp; They conduct and supervise the prosecution of criminal offenses in their respective&nbsp; provinces.&nbsp; In most of the provinces the provincial&nbsp; fiscal, not having any&nbsp; deputy, is required to personally direct the prosecution&nbsp; of all cases, while in the Moro Province the attorney must appear and personally take charge of&nbsp; the prosecution&nbsp; of cases&nbsp; when&nbsp; the&nbsp; public interests require&nbsp; it, but otherwise the prosecution&nbsp; of all such cases is under his supervision and control.&nbsp; In these matters he, as well as the provincial fiscals, is&nbsp; an officer of the court and subject to its discretion.<br><br>The provision of law authorizing and&nbsp; directing the judge of the&nbsp; Court of First Instance to appoint a temporary fiscal when the regular fiscals fail or refuse to discharge their duty, is not found in Act No. 83, known as "The&nbsp; Provincial Government Act," except as has been added thereto by subsequent legislation.&nbsp; This authority was granted&nbsp; under Act No. 223, which&nbsp; provided that the judge&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Court of First Instance for the province is authorized and required to appoint a temporary provincial fiscal under those circumstances.&nbsp; The word "provincial" was dropped in the amendatory Act, No. 1699.&nbsp; The phrase "The judge of the&nbsp; Court of First Instance for the province is authorized and required to appoint a temporary fiscal," is general in its nature.&nbsp; It applies, in the absence of explicit exceptions, to&nbsp; all Courts of First&nbsp; Instance outside of the city of&nbsp; Manila with equal force.&nbsp; There is no provision in Act No. 787, or its amendments, taking this power from the court.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the&nbsp; provincial&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fiscal fails or refuses to discharge his duty in the prosecution of criminal cases, the judge of the Court of First Instance is not only authorized but is required to appoint a temporary fiscal to represent the Government in such cases. The attorney for the Moro Province and his assistant stand in the same position as a provincial fiscal with&nbsp; reference to this matter.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Court of First Instance for the Moro Province did not have authority to&nbsp; appoint a temporary fiscal when the exigencies of the&nbsp; service demanded it,&nbsp; it might occur that the whole court machinery, with reference to criminal cases, would be impeded on account of the refusal on the part of the attorney, or&nbsp; his assistant,&nbsp; to perform their duties.&nbsp;&nbsp; The presiding judge of the Court&nbsp; of First Instance for the Moro Province has the power to&nbsp; cause the prosecution of criminal cases to go&nbsp; forward,&nbsp; and if the officer designated by law&nbsp; to&nbsp; prosecute such criminal cases fails&nbsp; or refuses to perform his duty,&nbsp; then&nbsp; the&nbsp; judge or court must relieve such officer temporarily and appoint a qualified person to take his place.<br><br>The motion presented by the attorney for the Moro Province on the 27th day of December,&nbsp; asking the&nbsp; court to annul that part of the order of December&nbsp; 16, 1910,&nbsp; disqualifying&nbsp; him from representing the&nbsp; prosecution in the criminal, case against Edward Dworak was acted&nbsp; upon on the 20th of the following month and granted.&nbsp; The same court that issued the order annulled it. It is not a question of Judge Gale issuing the order and Judge Low annulling it; it is a question of the power of the Court of First Instance to issue and annul&nbsp; said&nbsp; order.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact that&nbsp; different judges took part can not alter or diminish the power of the court - it was one and the same court.&nbsp; The true test is, would Judge Gale have had authority to annul that order in case he had passed upon the motion?&nbsp; We think he would have had such authority.&nbsp; This being true, Judge Low&nbsp; had exactly the same authority that Judge&nbsp; Gale would have had. When the order of December 16 was issued the court&nbsp; had certain facts before it upon which said order was based. When the court annulled this order on January 20 it might have had different and sufficient facts upon which to base this annulling order.&nbsp;&nbsp; The special&nbsp; attorney on his appointment became an officer of the court, subject to its direction. The court, if justified by the facts,&nbsp; had authority, under the law, to relieve him and direct the&nbsp; regular provincial attorney to take charge of the case.<br><br>The petitioner relies upon the doctrine enumerated' m the case of Orais <span style="font-style: italic;">vs. </span>Escano (14 Phil. Rep., 208).&nbsp; In this case the Court of First Instance, Hon.&nbsp; Charles&nbsp; E. Burritt presiding,&nbsp; issued&nbsp; on&nbsp; the 21st of September,&nbsp; 1905, an order granting the administratrix permission to sell certain propn erty.&nbsp;&nbsp; The same court, Hon. William F. Morris presiding, annulled and set aside the said order on the 24th of June, 1907.&nbsp; From this&nbsp; last order the defendant appealed.&nbsp; The Supreme Court held that under the facts as presented the Court of First Instance erred&nbsp; in setting aside said order. That part of the&nbsp; opinion which refers&nbsp; to&nbsp; the facts is as follows (p. 212):<br><blockquote>"It is not shown that the purchaser of the&nbsp; property, Jacinta Escaño, had&nbsp; received any notice of the motion to set aside the sale.&nbsp; Nearly two years had elapsed between the sale and the&nbsp; motion.&nbsp;&nbsp; The sale was made under an order of the court.&nbsp;&nbsp; The purchaser&nbsp; had&nbsp; a&nbsp; right&nbsp; to believe that the court had complied with the law and that she had, therefore,&nbsp; obtained&nbsp; a good title.&nbsp; Whether she had obtained&nbsp; a good&nbsp; title or not she certainly was&nbsp; entitled to&nbsp; notice before any action was taken by the court&nbsp; by which she should be deprived of her title."<br></blockquote>It is true that the court, continuing, said:<br><blockquote>"Judges of coordinate jurisdiction, acting within the same jurisdiction, should not annul or set aside orders made by other judges&nbsp; of equal&nbsp; jurisdiction,&nbsp; until&nbsp; some new fact or condition&nbsp; is presented.&nbsp; The parties should&nbsp; be&nbsp; compelled to take their&nbsp; exception and wait for a final decision, and if not then corrected, to&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; from alleged illegal orders. As a general rule, a judge has no power to review, on the same facts, the decisions of a coordinate judge, the remedy being by appeal."<br></blockquote>The&nbsp; decision of the&nbsp; court rests upon the facts as above stated, and not upon these propositions of law.&nbsp; The judge who issued the&nbsp; annulling&nbsp; order&nbsp; succeeded the judge&nbsp; who issued&nbsp; the original order, as presiding judge of the court wherein the case was pending, and, therefore, had precisely the same authority and jurisdiction with regard&nbsp; to&nbsp; that case as his predecessor would have had in the event he had continued as&nbsp; presiding judge until the&nbsp; motion praying the issuance of the annulling order was submitted.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was one and the&nbsp; same court that issued both&nbsp; orders.&nbsp;&nbsp; If Judge Burritt and Judge Norris had been holding court in Leyte at the&nbsp; same time,&nbsp; and if one had issued the&nbsp; order&nbsp; and the other annulled it while they were both acting in the same province, then the question might have been different.<br><br>The&nbsp; facts as alleged&nbsp; in the petition in the case at bar are not sufficient&nbsp; to justify this court&nbsp; in issuing the preliminary injunction.&nbsp; In reaching this conclusion we have unavoidably discussed and practically decided the petitioner's right to his principal remedy.&nbsp; In other words, we have held&nbsp; that under the law the Court of First Instance for the Moro Province has the&nbsp; same power,&nbsp; with reference to the questions under&nbsp; consideration, as courts of&nbsp; other provinces have, and that the court had authority, under the law, to issue the two orders&nbsp; of December 16 and January 20.&nbsp; The&nbsp; allegations in the&nbsp; complaint do not show such an abuse of discretion as would&nbsp; warrant us in issuing an&nbsp; order to show cause&nbsp; and allow this case to go forward.<br><br>The&nbsp; preliminary injunction prayed for is,&nbsp; therefore, denied, and if&nbsp; an&nbsp; amended&nbsp; petition is not filed within sixty days, the case will be dismissed, with&nbsp; costs&nbsp; <i>de&nbsp; oficio. </i>&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano, C.
