				<h4>
				G.R. No. 12607, September 27, 1917</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. RUPINO PARRO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="juatify">The defendant and appellant had had trouble with his brother Silverio Parro 
regarding family property by reason of which personal enmity had been engendered 
between them. With this as the motive, the defendant procured an ignorant man by 
the name of Gabino Calindatas to kill the brother and grandniece of the 
defendant for a reward of P60 and a promise to maintain the family of Calindatas 
if he was arrested, with a further statement that Calindatas could not be 
prosecuted after the expiration of three years. Calindatas, following the 
instructions of the defendant, on the night of April 16, 1913, waylaid the 
brother Silverio Parro and the small girl Paciencia Sendencia in an uninhabited 
place on the seashore and killed them with a dagger. Calindatas then reported to 
the defendant that his orders had been executed, whereupon the defendant sent 
men to bury the bodies in the sea.
<p>These facts constitute murder by inducement for a price and make the 
defendant guilty as principal in the commission of the crime. (Art. 13, No. 2, 
Penal Code, and U. S. <em>vs</em>. Gamao [1912], 23 Phil., 81â€”in connection with 
art. 403, No. 2, Penal Code and U. S. <em>vs</em>. Indanan ([1913], 24 Phil., 
203. See also as corroborative authority U. S. <em>vs</em>. Valdez [1915], 30 
Phil., 293, affirmed by the United States Supreme Court) There also concur the 
aggravating circumstances of evident premeditation, relationship, and commission 
in the night time and in an uninhabited place (and possibly others), offset by 
no mitigating circumstance. The trial court sentenced the defendant and 
appellant to <em>cadena perpetua</em>, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased 
Silverio Parro and Paciencia Sendencia each in the amount of P500, and to pay 
the costs. Agreeable to the recommendation of the Attorney-General and following 
the mandatory precepts of the law, we are forced to eliminate from this judgment 
so much as provides for life imprisonment and in lieu thereof to sentence the 
defendant and appellant Rufino Parro to be hanged until dead in accordance with 
law, with the costs of this instance. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Carson, Araullo</em>, and <em>Street, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p></div>
