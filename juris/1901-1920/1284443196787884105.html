				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Does a private individual who, claiming to be the owner of a parcel of land, 
with companions comes upon this property under cultivation by another and there 
by the use of a revolver to intimidate drives the tenant away and cuts six 
cavans of palay, claimed as payment for rent, commit the crime of coercion as 
charged in the complaint and as found by the trial court, or the crime of 
robbery as recommended by the Attorney-General? This question contains the 
salient points necessary for resolution, putting others as to which there is 
doubt to one side.
<p>The Attorney-General supports his contention that the crime of robbery has 
been committed with the citation of the decision of the Supreme Court of Spain 
of January 18, 1887, and the case of U. S. <em>vs</em>. Albao ([1914], 29 Phil. 
Rep., 86). We believe, however, that the facts herein follow rather other 
decisions of this court, of which U. S. <em>vs</em>. Vega ([1903], 2 Phil. Rep., 
167); U. S. <em>vs</em>. Tupular ([1906], 7 Phil. Rep., 8); U. S. <em>vs</em>. 
Tremoya ([1908], 10 Phil. Rep., 89) ; and U. S. <em>vs</em>. Mena ([1908], 11 
Phil. Rep., 543) are the most prominent. Thus, in the first case of United 
States <em>vs</em>. Vega, the crime charged was robbery. The facts as set forth 
in the decision were as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"One morning in March, 1898, the four accused, provided with bolos and 
firearms, went to a granary belonging to Ponciano Alba, situated at the place 
called Tansa Norte, within the limits of the town of Capiz, Panay, and, under 
threats of death, compelled Basilio Difon, the person left in charge by the 
owner, to leave the house and to deliver the palay which was stored there under 
lock and key. This Difon did and made delivery of the palay by measure, this 
operation lasting two days. It appeared that there were 447 cavanes of palay, 
which were taken out and carried away on sleds, in the presence of witnesses, to 
the house of Fernando. They also carried away agricultural instruments, a 
caldron, 2 <em>barotos</em>, 43 boards, 5 beams, a milk cow, and 10 carabaos 
which were in the field."</p></blockquote>
<p>Note the similarity of the facts in the Vega case and in the present 
instanceâ€”use of firearms, intimidation, palay unlawfully taken. Note further 
that Mr. Justice Torres, speaking for the court, states: "Notwithstanding the 
fact that Fernando Vega, who was the principal offender in this case, alleges 
that he was the owner of the property of which he took possession by means of 
this coercion of the person left in charge of it, it is not permissible to take 
the law into one's own hands, and to seize the property of a third person 
without being authorized to do so, and entirely disregarding the authorities 
whose duty it is to settle disagreements between private individuals and to give 
each one that which is his due, in accordance with the law." Note, finally, that 
the court held that the facts proven constituted the offense of coercion and not 
robbery.</p>
<p>The distinction between the two lines of decisions, the one holding to 
robbery and the other to coercion, is deemed to be the intention of the accused. 
Was the purpose with intent to gain to take the property of another by the use 
of force or intimidation? Then, conviction for robbery. Was the purpose, without 
authority of law but still believing himself the owner or the creditor, to 
compel another to do something against his will and to seize property? Then, 
conviction for coercion under article 497 of the Penal Code. The motives of the 
accused are the prime criterion. (5 Groizard, Codigo Penal, p. 716.) And there 
was no common robber in the present case, but a man who had fought bitterly for 
title to his ancestral estate, taking the law into his own hands and attempting 
to collect what he thought was due him. (See Villa Abrille <em>vs</em>. 
Banuelos, [1911], 20 Phil. Rep., 1, involving title to land occupied by 
complainant.) <em>Animus furandi</em> was lacking.</p>
<p>Finding no error in the judgment of the lower court, sentencing the accused 
to two months and one day of <em>arresto mayor</em>, with the accessory 
penalties of article 61 of the Penal Code, to pay a fine of three hundred pesos, 
or to suffer subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the 
costs, the same is affirmed with the costs of this instance. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Johnson, Carson, Araullo</em>, and <em>Street, JJ.,</em> 
concur.</p></div>
