				<h4>
				G.R. No. 1460, February 16, 1904</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE, VS. MAXIMO GUILLERMO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MAPA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">It is a fact plainly proven in this case that the accused attacked the victim 
with a pocket knife, causing a wound in the left hypochondrium which caused his 
death on the fourth day. Two witnesses who were present testified under oath 
regarding the said assault and its results, their testimony having been 
confirmed by the statements made by the deceased to his wife and to the 
physician who attended him. The physician testified that the wound was mortal. 
The same witnesses and the accused himself also testified to the fact of the 
death of the deceased.
<p>The act charged constitutes the crime of homicide, defined and punished by 
article 404 of the Penal Code. There is to be considered in favor of the 
defendant mitigating circumstance 6 of article 9, he having committed the act 
while in an intoxicated condition, which was not habitual with him, as is 
sufficiently proven by the evidence in the case.</p>
<p>Therefore the sentence of twelve years and one day of <em>reclusion 
temporal</em> imposed on the defendant by the Court of First Instance is in 
accordance with the law. The defendant is also sentenced to pay to the heirs of 
the deceased an indemnity of 1,000 pesos, Philippine currency.</p>
<p>With the addition of sentencing the defendant to pay this indemnity, we 
affirm the judgment appealed from, imposing the costs of this instance upon the 
defendant. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Cooper, Willard, McDonough,</em> and 
<em>Johnson, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
