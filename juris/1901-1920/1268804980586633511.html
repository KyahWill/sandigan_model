				<BR><STRONG>STREET, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The plaintiff, H. C. Best, was engaged in March, 1914, by Lizarraga Hermanos, 
a mercantile partnership, to take charge of the sugar central "Bearin," 
belonging to the firm and situated in the municipality of Kabankalan, Occidental 
Negros. It was agreed that Best should be the superintendent, or technical head 
of the central; that he should be responsible at all times for good service and 
order, and that the entire personnel, mechanical, technical, and scientific, 
should be under his control, so far as regards service. The contract, which was 
evidenced by a letter written by the defendants, was to run from the time when 
Best should assume the duties of his position till the end of April or 1st of 
May of the next year. The salary of the plaintiff was to be at the rate of P450 
per month, with board, lodging, laundry service, and attendance of servant.
<p>Soon after the plaintiff assumed the performance of his duties under this 
contract (April 8, 1914) difficulties arose; and serious misunderstandings 
developed between him and his employers. A crisis was reached in the latter part 
of July and early days of August, when both parties seem to have arrived at the 
conclusion that the situation was unendurable, and the plaintiff left.</p>
<p>Upon September 11, 1914, he instituted this action, claiming damages of the 
defendant for breach of the contract of employment. At the hearing in the Court 
of First Instance judgment was rendered in his favor for the sum of P4,818.25, 
with interest; and from this judgment the defendant has appealed,</p>
<p>The theory of the plaintiff's case is that he was in effect discharged by his 
employers without legal justification. The defense is based on the assertion 
that the plaintiff was technically incompetent; that he mistreated the employees 
and displayed such lack of tact in his relations with his inferiors that 
disorder resulted, as a consequence of which his continued stay at the central 
in the capacity of superintendent would have been unsafe for him and disastrous 
to the interests of the house.</p>
<p>The Court of First Instance found that the plaintiff was technically 
competent to discharge the duties of the position which he was employed to fill; 
and we think that this finding is sustained by the proof. He had ample 
experience in such matters, and the changes introduced by him in the central 
were, we think, such as any competent superintendent might have adopted.</p>
<p>Upon the question whether the plaintiff quit the position or was discharged 
by his employers, the court below arrived at the conclusion that the plaintiff 
was not in terms discharged by the defendants but that he himself quit the 
contract. We think this is the proper conclusion to be drawn from the evidence 
on this point. The trial court also found that there was not the slightest doubt 
that he was forced to quit. The conditions which necessitated the taking of this 
step are not clearly exhibited in the decision of the court below, but they will 
be here briefly stated, as the proper solution of the case requires us to 
determine who was to blame for those conditions.</p>
<p>To begin with, the place was a hard one to fill, as the establishment was not 
well organized, nor the force of employees well disciplined. Best had no 
previous experience in dealing with Filipino laborers, and his inability to 
communicate directly with them, and most of the other employees under him, led 
to misunderstandings and trouble. The difficulties of the situation were 
increased by the circumstance that one of the members of the firm of Lizarraga 
Hermanos, who was present at the central and assumed a superior authority with 
respect to the management of the hacienda, failed to give the support to Best 
which possibly might have made things go smoothly. In early June word had 
reached the head office of the firm in Iloilo to the effect that things were not 
going well at Kabankalan; that Best by his brusqueness and lack of tact had 
incurred the ill-will of his subordinates; and that dissension was developing in 
the establishment. About the same time Best himself was complaining of a lack of 
subordination and of interference with his authority. Therefore, upon June 6, 
1914, a letter was written from Iloilo, in reply to one received from Best. In 
this letter Lizarraga Hermanos told Best that they would take the necessary 
steps to make the entire personnel realize that he was superintendent and that 
they owed obedience to him in everything relating to the work. In the same 
letter the head of the firm proceeded at some length to give Best advice about 
how to manage Filipino labor. We think that these suggestions were well 
intended, and that Best would have done well to profit by them. He says, 
however, that he paid no attention to that letter.</p>
<p>A short while after this, upon a certain occasion, Best had an altercation 
with a Filipino contractor of labor, and some thirty laborers who were at hand 
intervened by stoning Best. The incident made a deep impression on everybody 
around the central and hacienda, and the senior member of the house came up from 
Iloilo to investigate. After examining into the situation thoroughly for a few 
days he found that the entire personnel was disaffected, and that if the 
superintendent should be retained a number of other employees would probably 
quit. As a consequence a conference was held between the members of the firm who 
were then present at Kabankalan and Best; and upon this occasion they asked him 
to resign and offered, if he would do so, to pay his salary a month or two in 
advance. This he refused to do, but the next day, as the company's launch was 
returning to Iloilo, he embarked and did not return.</p>
<p>Our conclusions, after repeated and careful examination of the evidence in 
this case are these: (1) That when the conference above mentioned was held both 
parties to this contract recognized that under the conditions which had arisen 
the continuance of Best as superintendent of the central was impracticable, if 
not impossible, and that the only sensible course to be pursued was for him to 
leave; (2) that the conditions which made this step necessary resulted chiefly 
from the inability of Best to fulfill the requirements of that part of his 
contract which made him responsible "at all times for good service and order;" 
(3) that Lizarraga Hermanos were not immediately responsible for the conditions 
which made Best's departure necessary, although their course was in many 
respects subject to criticism; (4) that no right of action arose whereby the 
plaintiff became entitled to recover anything by way of damages for breach of 
contract; but (5) that inasmuch as he left with the consent of his employers he 
is entitled to recover what was earned upon salary account up to the date of his 
departure.</p>
<p>It will be observed that the burden of proof is upon the plaintiff in this 
action to show that the defendants were responsible for the conditions which 
forced him to quit; and undoubtedly if it were shown that the trouble which 
developed was fomented by a member of the house of Lizarraga Hermanos or that 
they, in violation of their own obligations, otherwise created intolerable 
conditions in order to force him out, the action of Best in leaving would have 
been justified. Some irritating things were certainly done to the vexation of 
the plaintiff by more than one member of the firm; but these things were not so 
vital in the contractual relations of the parties as the inability of the 
plaintiff to adjust his own methods to the requirements of the situation assumed 
by him under the contract.</p>
<p>Even assuming that both parties to the contract were equally to blame for the 
conditions which led to this rupture, the plaintiff could not recover; for in 
order to maintain an action for a breach of contract the plaintiff must prove 
that he was forced out by conditions created without fault of his own. Where 
both parties are to blame, the fault of one may be considered to offset that of 
the other; and the legal result is that while either may quit, neither can 
maintain an action for breach of contract against the other. In such case we 
consider the situation to be substantially the same as if the contract had 
become impracticable or impossible of performance without the fault of either, 
and had been dissolved by mutual consent.</p>
<p>There is another point in the case deserving of notice. Upon August 11, 1914, 
upon being informed that the plaintiff would assert a claim for damages arising 
from the alleged breach of contract, Lizarraga Hermanos addressed a letter to 
Best's attorneys in Iloilo, in which after denying that the firm had violated 
the contract, they stated that he could return to the position of superintendent 
at Kabankalan, if he wished. This offer to receive him back was coupled with 
conditions substantially the same as those under which he had been originally 
employed. It has been held by this court that an offer on the part of an 
employer, made in good faith, to take back a discharged employee on the same 
terms as before, is admissible in evidence, and if refused without good reason, 
has the effect of destroying the right of the employee to recover damages from 
the date when such offer should have been accepted. (Lemoine <em>vs</em>. Alkan, 
33 Phil. Rep., 162.) It is true that in this communication Lizarraga Hermanos 
inserted some words which tended to irritate rather than soothe; but it is 
nevertheless questionable whether Best was not bound to return to duty in 
response to that invitation, and in our opinion the letter should have been 
admitted in evidence, in order that its effect might have been considered. 
Instead of this it was rejected by the court below as irrelevant.</p>
<p>From what has been said it follows that the judgment must be reversed in so 
far as it awards damages in respect to the salary that would have accrued under 
the contract after the date of the plaintiff's departure from Kabankalan, but as 
already suggested, the plaintiff is entitled to recover for the value of his 
services prior to that date. Upon this point we find that the plaintiff was 
entitled to his salary for four months, less two days, or the sum of P1,771. On 
the question as to how much the plaintiff had been paid upon salary account, we 
find no competent proof in the record other than his own statement, in which he 
says that he had been paid the sum of P730. In the opinion written by the trial 
judge it is said that the lawyer for the plaintiff has stated that the plaintiff 
had been paid about P1,400 during his term of service; but there is no evidence 
to support this statement, and we are unwilling to base a judgment of this court 
upon such a suggestion unsupported by proof. It seems to us that if the 
statement made by Best had been erroneous, it was the duty of the defendants to 
correct it. Judgment will accordingly be here entered in favor of the plaintiff 
for the sum of one thousand and forty-one pesos (P1,041) with interest from 
September 11, 1914, but without any special findings as to costs of this 
instance. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Carson, Araullo, Malcolm</em>, and <em>Avanceña,
