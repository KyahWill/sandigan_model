				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is a motion to dismiss the appeal based upon the ground that the 
appellant failed to present his brief within the time prescribed. Rule 23 of the 
Supreme Court provides:</p>
<p>"Rule 23.—If the appellant fails to serve his brief within the time aforesaid 
(Rule 21), the court <em>may</em>, on motion of the appellee and notice to the 
appellant, <em>dismiss</em> the bill of exceptions on appeal * * *."</p>
<p>The facts of record in the present case, of importance for a consideration of 
the motion presented, are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) This action was commenced in the Court of Land Registration by the 
petitioner and appellant on the 2d day of August, 1915.</p>
<p>(2) On the 3d day of August, 1915, the petitioner and appellant presented a 
petition praying that a preliminary injunction, <em>ex parte</em>, be issued 
against some of the defendants and appellees to prevent them from interfering in 
any way whatsoever with the possession of the land involved in the original 
petition.</p>
<p>(3) On the 4th day of August, 1915, the Honorable Vicente Nepomuceno, judge, 
issued an order directing that the said injunction be issued upon the 
presentation of a bond in the sum of P500 by the petitioner and appellant.</p>
<p>(4) On the 5th day of August, 1915, the petitioner, together with two 
sureties, executed and delivered said required bond for the sum of P500.</p>
<p>(5) On the 4th day of August, 1915, and the day before the execution and 
delivery of the bond required, the injunction prayed for was granted and duly 
served upon the respective parties upon the 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th day of August, 
1915.</p>
<p>(6) On the 23d day of August, 1915, the petitioner and appellant presented 
another petition, praying that an injunction, <em>ex parte</em>, be issued 
against other persons who he claimed were interfering with the possession of the 
land in question as well as the possession of other lands which were then 
involved in other litigation. (Cases 784 and 785.)</p>
<p>(7) On the 4th day of September, 1915, the Honorable Vicente Nepomuceno 
ordered the injunction prayed for in each of said cases also. (784 and 785.)</p>
<p>(8) On the 16th day of September, 1915, a bond was given by the petitioner 
and appellant in this particular cause, and on the 18th day of September, 1915, 
the injunction prayed for was duly issued.</p>
<p>(9) Later, various oppositions were interposed against the registration of 
the parcel of land in question.</p>
<p>(10) Finally, the present petition, together with three others (Cases No. 
784, 785 and 825) were duly brought on for trial, and after hearing the 
evidence, the Honorable Vicente Nepomuceno, on the 15th day of January, 1917, 
rendered a final decision denying the petition for the registration of the 
parcel of land involved in the present case and dismissed the same without 
costs.</p>
<p>(11) A motion for a rehearing was made by the petitioner in each of said 
causes as well as in the present case (Cases No. 784, 785 and 825y and was 
granted in part, on the 8th day of February, 1917.</p>
<p>(12) From the decision of the lower court the petitioner duly appealed to 
this court.</p>
<p>(13) On the 17th of February, 1917, the petitioner asked that he be given 
thirty days within which to present a bill of exceptions in each of said 
causes.</p>
<p>(14) On the 15th day of March, 1917, the petitioner asked for another 
extension of time within which to present his bill of exceptions which petition 
was granted on the same day giving the petitioner and appellant forty days 
within which to present his bill of exceptions.</p>
<p>(15) The bill of exceptions was actually presented in the court on the 23d 
day of April, 1917.</p>
<p>(16) The <em>expediente</em> in the present case, as well as those in the 
other three cases mentioned, was received in the Supreme Court upon the 13th day 
of October, 1917. The appellant was notified on the 19th day of October, 1917, 
to deposit the sum of P24 as the filing fee in the Supreme Court, and the sum of 
P74.37 for printing the bill of exceptions.</p>
<p>(17) The appellant having failed to make said deposits mentioned in the 
preceding paragraph, the appellees, on the 19th day of November, 1917, presented 
a motion praying that the appeal be dismissed, for the reason that the appellant 
had failed to make the deposits required. On the 5th day of December, 1917, the 
appellant having deposited the required amounts in accordance with the notice 
above referred to, the motion of the appellees to dismiss the appeal was 
denied.</p>
<p>(18) On the 12th day of January, 1918, the petitioner and appellant presented 
his printed bill of exceptions.</p>
<p>(19) On the 18th day of January, 1918, the petitioner and appellant presented 
a motion praying that the stenographer be required to send to this court a 
transcript of the evidence taken during the trial in said various causes, and on 
the 30th day of January, 1918, said petition was granted and the said transcript 
was duly received in the Supreme Court on the 25th day of April, 1918, of which 
fact the appellant was duly notified on the 26th day of April, 1918.</p>
<p>(20) On the 22d day of May, 1918, the appellant presented a petition asking 
that he be given two months within which to present his brief, which petition 
was granted upon the 27th day of May, 1918, giving the appellant fifteen days 
only within which to present his brief.</p>
<p>(21) On the 7th day of June, 1918, the appellant presented another petition 
asking that he be given one month within which to present his brief, which 
petition was granted on the 12th day of June, 1918.</p>
<p>(22) On the 17th day of July, 1918, the appellant having failed to present 
his brief within the time granted, the appellees presented the present motion 
asking that the appeal be dismissed, for the reason that the appellant had 
failed to present his brief within time.</p>
<p>(23) On the 20th day of July, 1918, the appellant presented his brief.</p>
<p>Considering the foregoing facts and the unnecessary annoyances to which the 
petitioner has put the defendants, and the apparent effort to delay a final 
disposition of the case, we are of the opinion, and so decide, that the motion 
to dismiss should be and is hereby granted, with costs to the appellants. So 
ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Street, Malcolm, Avanceña</em>, and <em>Fisher, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p></div>
