				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal by the applicant and appellant from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija, denying the registration of the larger portion of parcel No. 1 (Exhibit A of the petitioner), marked by the letters A, B, and C on the plan, Exhibit 1, of the Government.<br><br>One Restituto Romero y Ponce apparently gained possession of a considerable tract of land located in the municipality of San Jose, Province&nbsp; of Nueva Ecija, in the year 1882.&nbsp; He took advantage of the Royal Decree of February 13, 1894, to obtain a possessory information title to the land, registered as such on February 8,&nbsp; 1896.&nbsp; Parcel No. 1, included within the limits of the possessory information title of Restituto Romero, was sold in&nbsp; February, 1907, to Cornelio Ramos, the instant petitioner, and his&nbsp; wife Ambrosia Salamanca.<br><br>Ramos instituted appropriate proceedings to have his title registered.&nbsp; Opposition was entered by the Director of Lands on the ground that Ramos had not acquired a good title from the Spanish government and by the Director of Forestry on the ground that the&nbsp; first parcel was forest land.&nbsp; The trial&nbsp; court agreed&nbsp; with the objectors and excluded parcel No. 1 from registration.&nbsp; So much for the facts.<br><br>As to the law, the principal argument of the Solicitor- General is based on the provisions of the Spanish Mortgage Law and of the Royal Decree of February 13, 1894, commonly known as the Maura Law.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Solicitor-General would emphasize that for land&nbsp; to come under the protective aegis&nbsp; of the Maura Law, it must have been shown that the land was cultivated for six years previously, and that it was not land&nbsp; which pertained to the "zonas forestates." As proof that the land was, even as long ago as the years 1894 to 1896, forestal and not agricultural in nature is the fact that there are yet found thereon trees from 50 to 80 years of age.<br><br>We do not stop to decide this contention, although it might be possible, following the doctrine laid down by the United States Supreme Court with&nbsp; reference to Mexican and Spanish grants within the United States, where some recital is claimed to be false, to say that the possessory information, apparently having taken cognizance&nbsp; of the requisites for title, should not now be disturbed.&nbsp; (Hancock&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.&nbsp; McKinney&nbsp; [1851], 7 Tex., 192; Hornsby and Roland <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. United States [1869], 10 Wall., 224,) It is sufficient, as will later appear, merely to notice that the pre-decessor in interest to the petitioner at least held this tract of land under color of title.<br><br>Subsection 6 of section 54,&nbsp; of Act No.&nbsp; 926, entitled The Public Land Law, as amended by Act No. 1908, reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"6. All persons who by themselves or their predecessors in interest&nbsp; have been in the&nbsp; open, continuous, exclusive, and&nbsp; notorious&nbsp; possession&nbsp; and&nbsp; occupation of agricultural public lands, as&nbsp; defined by said Act of Congress of July first,&nbsp; nineteen hundred and two, under a <i>bona fide</i> claim of ownership except as&nbsp; against the Government, for a period of ten years next preceding the&nbsp; twenty-sixth day of July, nineteen hundred and four, except when prevented by war or <span style="font-style: italic;">force majeure</span>, shall be conclusively presumed to have performed all the conditions essential to a government grant and to have&nbsp; received the same, and shall&nbsp; be entitled to a certificate of title to such land under the provisions of this chapter."</blockquote><br>There are two parts&nbsp; to&nbsp; the above quoted&nbsp; subsection which must be&nbsp; discussed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first&nbsp; relates to the open, continuous,&nbsp; exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation of what, for present purposes, can be conceded to be agricultural public land, under a <i>bona fide</i>&nbsp; claim of ownership.<br><br>Actual possession of land consists in the manifestation of acts of dominion over it of such a nature&nbsp; as a party would naturally exercise over his own property.&nbsp; Relative to actuality of possession, it is admitted that the petitioner has cultivated only&nbsp; about&nbsp; one fourth&nbsp; of&nbsp; the entire tract. This is graphically portrayed&nbsp; by Exhibit&nbsp; 1 of the Government, following:<br><br>(<span style="font-weight: bold;">see image on vol. 39,&nbsp; page 179</span>)<br><br>The question at once arises:&nbsp; Is the actual occupancy of a part of the land described in the instrument giving color of title sufficient to give title to the&nbsp; entire&nbsp; tract of land?<br><br>The doctrine of constructive possession indicates the answer.&nbsp; The general&nbsp; rule is that the possession and cultivation of a portion of a tract under claim of ownership of all&nbsp; is a constructive possession&nbsp; of all, if the remainder is not in the adverse possession of another.&nbsp; (Barr <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Gratz's Heirs [1819], 4 Wheat, 213; Ellicott <i>vs</i>. Pearl [1836], 10 Pet, 412; Smith <i>vs</i>. Gale&nbsp; [1892], 144 U. S., 509.)&nbsp; Of course,&nbsp; there&nbsp; are a&nbsp; number of qualifications&nbsp; to the&nbsp; rule, one particularly&nbsp; relating to the size of the tract in controversy with reference to the&nbsp; portion actually in possession of the claimant&nbsp;&nbsp; It is here only necessary to apply the general rule.<br><br>The claimant has&nbsp; color of title; he acted in good faith; and he&nbsp; has had open, peaceable, and notorious possession of a portion of the property, sufficient to apprise the&nbsp; community and the world that the land was for his enjoyment. (See&nbsp; arts.&nbsp; 446, 448, Civil Code.)&nbsp; Possession&nbsp; in the eyes of the law does not mean that a man has to have his feet on every square meter of ground before it can&nbsp; be said that he is in possession.&nbsp; Ramos and his predecessor in interest fulfilled the requirements of the law&nbsp; on the supposition that the premises consisted of agricultural public land.<br><br>The second division&nbsp; of the law requires consideration of the term "agricultural public land.&nbsp; " The&nbsp; law affirms that the phrase is defined by the Act of Congress of July 1st, 1902,&nbsp; known as the Philippine Bill.&nbsp; Turning&nbsp; to the Philippine&nbsp; Bill, we find in sections&nbsp; 13 to 18&nbsp; thereof that three classes of land are mentioned.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first is variously denominated "public land" or "public domain," the&nbsp; second "mineral land," and the third "timber land."&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 18 of the Act of Congress comes nearest to a&nbsp; precise&nbsp; definition, when it&nbsp; makes&nbsp; the&nbsp; determination of&nbsp; whether the land is more valuable for agricultural or for forest uses the test of its&nbsp; character.<br><br>Although these sections of the Philippine Bill have come before the courts on numerous occasions, what was said in the case of Jones <i>vs</i>. Insular Government ([1906],&nbsp; 6 Phil., 122),&nbsp; is still true, namely: '"the meaning of these sections is not clear and it is difficult to give to them a construction that&nbsp; will be&nbsp; entirely free&nbsp; from objection." In the case&nbsp; which gave most serious consideration to the subject&nbsp; (Mapa <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.&nbsp; Insular&nbsp; Government&nbsp; [1908],&nbsp; 10&nbsp; Phil., 175),&nbsp; it was found-that there does exist in&nbsp; the Act of Congress a&nbsp; definition of the phrase "agricultural public lands."&nbsp; It was&nbsp; said that the phrase "agricultural public lands" as&nbsp; used in Act No.&nbsp; 926 means ''those public lands acquired&nbsp; from Spain which&nbsp; are&nbsp; not timber&nbsp; or mineral lands."<br><br>The idea would appear to be to&nbsp; determine, by exclusion, if the land&nbsp; is forestal or&nbsp; mineral in nature&nbsp; and,&nbsp; if not so found,&nbsp; to consider it to be agricultural land.&nbsp; Here, again, Philippine law is not very helpful.&nbsp; For instance, section 1820 of the Administrative Code of 1917 provides: "For the purposes of this chapter, 'public forest'&nbsp; includes, except&nbsp; as otherwise&nbsp; specially&nbsp; indicated, all&nbsp; unreserved public land, including nipa&nbsp; and mangrove swamps, and all forest reserves of whatever character."&nbsp;&nbsp; This definition of "public forest," it will be&nbsp; noted, is merely "for the purposes of this chapter."&nbsp; A little further on, section 1827 provides: "Lands in public forests, not including forest reserves, upon&nbsp; the certification of the Director of Forestry that said&nbsp; lands are&nbsp; better adapted and&nbsp; more valuable for agricultural than for forest purposes and not required by the public interests to be kept under forest, shall be declared by the Department Head to be agricultural lands." With reference to the last section,&nbsp; there is no certification of the Director of Forestry in the record, as&nbsp; to&nbsp; whether this land is better adapted and more valuable for agricultural than for forest purposes.<br><br>The lexicographers define "forest" as "a large&nbsp; tract of land covered with&nbsp; a natural growth of trees and underbrush; a large&nbsp; wood."&nbsp; The authorities&nbsp; say that the word "forest" has a significant,&nbsp; not an&nbsp; insignificant meaning, and that it does not embrace land only partly woodland.<br><br>It is a tract of land covered with trees, usually of considerable extent.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Higgins <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Long Island R. Co. [1908], 114 N. Y. Supp., 262; People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Long Island R. Co. [1908], 110 N. Y. Supp., 512.)<br><br>The foresters say that&nbsp; no legal definition of "forest"&nbsp; is practicable or useful.&nbsp; B. H. Baden-Powell, in his work on Forest Law of India, states&nbsp; as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"Every definition of a forest that can be framed for legal&nbsp; purposes will be found either to exclude some&nbsp; cases to which the law ought to apply, or on the other hand, to include some with which the law ought not to interfere.&nbsp;&nbsp; It may be necessary, for example, to take under the law a tract of perfectly barren land which at present has neither trees, brushwood, nor grass on it, but which in the course of time it is hoped will be 'reboise;' but any definition wide enough to take in all such lands, would also take in much that was not wanted.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the&nbsp; other&nbsp; hand, the definition,&nbsp; if framed with reference to tree-growth,&nbsp; might (and indeed would be almost&nbsp; sure&nbsp; to)&nbsp; include a garden, shrubbery, orchard,&nbsp; or vineyard,&nbsp; which it was&nbsp; not&nbsp; designed to deal with."</blockquote>B. E. Fernow, in his work on the Economics of Forestry, states as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"A forest in the sense in which we use the term, as an economic factor, is by no means a mere collection&nbsp; of trees, but an organic whole&nbsp; in&nbsp; which all parts, although apparently heterogeneous, jumbled&nbsp; together by accident&nbsp; as&nbsp; it were&nbsp; and apparently unrelated,&nbsp; bear a&nbsp; close relation to each other and are as interdependent as any&nbsp; other beings and conditions in nature."</blockquote><br>The Director of Forestry of the Philippine Islands has said:<br><br><blockquote>"During the time of the passage of the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902,&nbsp; this question of forest&nbsp; and agricultural lands was beginning to receive some attention and&nbsp; it is clearly shown in&nbsp; section 18&nbsp; of the above&nbsp; mentioned&nbsp; Act; it leaves to&nbsp; the Bureau of Forestry the certification&nbsp; as to what lands are for agricultural or&nbsp; forest uses.&nbsp; Although the Act states timber lands, the Bureau has in its administration since the passage of this act construed this term to mean forest lands in the sense of what&nbsp; was necessary to protect, for the public good; waste lands&nbsp; without a tree have been&nbsp; declared more&nbsp; suitable&nbsp; |for&nbsp; forestry in many instances&nbsp; in the past.&nbsp;&nbsp; The term&nbsp; 'timber', gs used in England and in the United&nbsp; States in the past has been applied to wood suitable for construction purposes but with&nbsp; the increase in&nbsp; civilization and the application of new methods every plant producing wood has some useful purpose and the term timber lands&nbsp; is generally&nbsp; thought&nbsp; of&nbsp; as synonymous with&nbsp; forest lands or lands producing&nbsp; wood,&nbsp; or able to produce&nbsp; wood, if agricultural&nbsp; crops&nbsp; on the same land will&nbsp; not bring the financial return&nbsp; that timber will or if the same land is needed for protection purposes.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></div><br>"The laws in the&nbsp; United States recognize the necessity of technical advice of duly appointed boards and leave it in the hands of these boards to decide what lands are more valuable&nbsp; for forestry purposes&nbsp; or&nbsp; for agricultural purposes.<br><br>"In the Philippine Islands this policy is followed to&nbsp; as great an extent as allowable under the law.&nbsp;&nbsp; In many cases, in the&nbsp; opinion of the Bureau&nbsp; of&nbsp; Forestry,&nbsp; lands without a single tree on them are&nbsp; considered as true forest land. For&nbsp; instance, mountain sides which are too&nbsp; steep for cultivation under ordinary practice and which, if cultivated, under&nbsp; ordinary practice would&nbsp; destroy the big natural resource of&nbsp; the soil, by&nbsp; washing, is considered by this Bureau as forest land and in time would be reforested.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course,&nbsp; examples exist&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Mountain&nbsp; Province&nbsp; where steep hillsides have been terraced and intensive&nbsp; cultivation practiced but even then&nbsp; the mountain people&nbsp; are very careful not to destroy forests or other vegetative cover which they from experience have found protect their water supply.&nbsp; Certain chiefs have lodged protests with the Government against other tribes on&nbsp; the&nbsp; opposite&nbsp; side&nbsp; of the mountain cultivated by them,&nbsp; in order to prevent other tribes from cutting timber or destroy cover guarding their source of water for irrigation.<br><br>"Dr.&nbsp; M. S.&nbsp; Shaler,&nbsp; formerly Dean of&nbsp; the Lawrence Scientific School, remarked that if mankind could not devise and enforce ways dealing&nbsp; with the earth, which will preserve this source of life 'we must look forward to the time, remote&nbsp; it may be, yet equally discernible,&nbsp; when our kin having&nbsp; wasted its great&nbsp; inheritance will fade from the earth because of&nbsp; the ruin&nbsp; it has accomplished.'<br><br>"The method employed&nbsp; by&nbsp; the Bureau&nbsp; of Forestry in making inspection of lands, in order to determine whether they are more adapted for agricultural or forest purposes, by a technical and duly trained personnel on the different phases of the conservation of natural resources, is based upon a&nbsp; previously prepared set of questions in which the different characters&nbsp; of the land under inspection are discussed, namely:<br><br>"<i>Slope of land</i>: Level; moderate; steep; very steep.<br><br>"<i>Exposure</i>: North; South; East; West.<br><br>"<i>Soil</i>: Clay; sandy loam; sand; rocky; very rocky.<br><br>"<i>Character of soil cover</i>: Cultivated, grass land, brush land, brush land and timber mixed,&nbsp; dense forest.<br><br>"If cultivated, state crops being grown and approximate number&nbsp; of&nbsp; hectares&nbsp;&nbsp; under&nbsp;&nbsp; cultivation.&nbsp; (Indicate&nbsp; on sketch.)<br><br>"For&nbsp; growth of what agricultural products is this land suitable?<br><br>"State what portion of the tract&nbsp; is wooded, name of important&nbsp; timber&nbsp; species and estimate of stand in cubic meters&nbsp; per hectare, diameter&nbsp; and&nbsp; percentage of&nbsp; each species.<br><br>"If the land is covered with timber, state whether there is&nbsp; public land suitable for agriculture in&nbsp; vicinity, which is not covered with timber.<br><br>"Is&nbsp; this land more valuable for agricultural than&nbsp; for forest purposes?&nbsp; (State reasons in full.)<br><br>"Is&nbsp; this land&nbsp; included&nbsp; or adjoining any proposed&nbsp; or established forest reserve or communal forest?&nbsp; Description and ownership of improvements.<br><br>"If the land is claimed under private ownership, give the name&nbsp; of&nbsp; the claimant,&nbsp; his place of residence,&nbsp; and state briefly (if necessary on a separate sheet) the grounds upon which he bases his claim.<br><br>"When the inspection&nbsp; is made on a parcel of public land which has been applied for, the&nbsp; corresponding&nbsp; certificate is forwarded to the Director of Lands; if it is made on a privately claimed&nbsp; parcel for which the issuance of a title is requested from&nbsp; the Court of Land Registration,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the inspection shows the land to be more adapted for forest purposes,&nbsp; then the Director of Forestry requests the&nbsp; Attorney-General to file an opposition, sending him all data collected during the inspection and&nbsp; offering him the&nbsp; forest officer as a witness.<br><br>"It should be kept&nbsp; in mind that the&nbsp; lack of personnel of this Bureau, the limited time intervening between the notice for the trial of an <span style="font-style: italic;">expediente </span>of land and the day of the trial, and the difficulties in communications as well as the distance of the land in question greatly hinder&nbsp; the handling of this work.<br><br>"In&nbsp; the case of lands claimed as private property, the Director of Forestry, by means of his delegate the examining officer, submits before the court all evidence referring to the&nbsp; present forest condition of the land, so that the court may compare them with the alleged right by the claimant. Undoubtedly,, when the claimant presents a title&nbsp; issued&nbsp; by the proper authority or evidence&nbsp; of his right to the land showing that he complied with the requirements of the law, the forest certificate does not affect him in the least as such land should not be considered as a part of the public domain; but when the alleged right is merely that of possession, then the public or private character of the parcel is open to discussion and&nbsp; this&nbsp; character&nbsp; should be established&nbsp; not simply on the alleged right of the claimant but on the sylvical condition and soil characteristics of the land, and by comparison between&nbsp; this area,&nbsp; or different&nbsp; previously occupied areas, and those areas&nbsp; which&nbsp; still preserve their primitive character."</blockquote><br>Either way we look&nbsp; at&nbsp; this question we encounter&nbsp; difficulty.&nbsp;&nbsp; Indubitably, there should be conservation of the natural resources of the Philippines.&nbsp; The prodigality of the spendthrift who squanders his substance for the pleasure of the fleeting moment must be restrained for the less spectacular but surer policy which protects Nature's wealth for future generations.&nbsp; Such is the wise stand of our Government as represented by the Director of Forestry who, with the Forester for. the Government of the United States, believes in "the control of nature's powers by man&nbsp; for his own good." On the other hand, the presumption should be, in lieu of contrary proof, that land is&nbsp; agricultural in nature.&nbsp; One very apparent&nbsp; reason&nbsp; is that&nbsp; it is&nbsp; for&nbsp; the good&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Philippine&nbsp; Islands to have the large public domain come under private ownership.&nbsp; Such is&nbsp; the&nbsp; natural&nbsp; attitude of the sagacious citizen.<br><br>If in this instance, we give&nbsp; judicial sanction to a private claim, let it be noted that the Government,&nbsp; in the long run of cases, has its remedy.&nbsp; Forest reserves of public land can be established as provided by law.&nbsp; When&nbsp; the claim of the citizen and the&nbsp; claim of the Government as to a particular piece of property collide, if the Government desires to demonstrate that the land is in reality a forest, the Director of Forestry should submit to&nbsp; the court convincing proof that the land is not more valuable for agricultural than for forest purposes.&nbsp; Great consideration, it may be&nbsp; stated,&nbsp; should, and undoubtedly will&nbsp; be, paid by the courts to the opinion of the technical expert who speaks with&nbsp; authority on forestry matters.&nbsp; But a&nbsp; mere formal opposition on the&nbsp; part&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Attorney-General for&nbsp; the Director of Forestry, unsupported by satisfactory evidence will not stop the courts from giving&nbsp; title to the claimant.<br><br>We hold that the petitioner and appellant&nbsp; has proved a title to the entire tract&nbsp; of land&nbsp; for which&nbsp; he&nbsp; asked registration, under the provisions of subsection&nbsp; 6, of section&nbsp; 54, of&nbsp; Act No. 926, as amended&nbsp; by Act No.&nbsp; 1908, with reference to the Philippine Bill and the Royal Decree of February 13, 1894,&nbsp; and his&nbsp; possessory information.<br><br>Judgment is&nbsp; reversed&nbsp; and the lower court&nbsp; shall&nbsp; register in the name of the applicant the entire tract in parcel&nbsp; No. 1,&nbsp; as described in&nbsp; plan&nbsp; Exhibit&nbsp; A,&nbsp; without special finding as to&nbsp; costs.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Arellano, C.
