				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The facts  in this  case  have been  stipulated by the respective parties.  The stipulation  is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"1.  That the plaintiff was  appointed election inspector of the precinct of Daraga, municipality of Albay, on the 13th day of September, 1909, and did qualify and act as such election inspector in the general elections held in this province on November 2, 1909.</p>
  <p>"2.  That on  February 26,  1910, the plaintiff presented to the municipal council of Albay his written  resignation from the office of election  inspector.</p>
  <p>"3.  That the municipal council  of  Albay, at its  session of March  7, 1910, accepted  the resignation  tendered  by the plaintiff.</p>
  <p>"4.  That on March 21, 1910, at the session held by the municipal council of  Albay, the municipal president of the said municipality appointed the plaintiff lieutenant of police of Albay, which appointment was unanimously approved by the council; and on the  following day, March 22, 1910, the municipal president issued to  the  said  plaintiff  the proper certificate of appointment.</p>
  <p>"5.  That on March 22, 1910, the plaintiff legally qualified for, and took possession of, the office of lieutenant of police of the municipality of Albay.</p>
  <p>"6,  That on March 26,  1910, the  municipal  president of Albay,  acting in pursuance of an  order received from the provincial governor, suspended the plaintiff's appointment  and  summoned  the latter  to appear before the provincial board  of Albay on the  29th of March,  1910,  for the purpose of deciding upon the legality of his appointment  as such lieutenant of police, in view of his having discharged the  duties  of  election  inspector in  the  last election.</p>
  <p>"7.  That on March 29, 1910, the plaintiff, through  his attorney, appeared before  the  provincial board  and  demanded  that  it abstain from passing any resolution with respect to the legality  of  the  said  appointment, alleging that the said board lacked both the power and the jurisdiction so  to  do; but that the board did, notwithstanding, disapprove the resolution passed by the  municipal council of Albay on March 21, 1910.</p>
  <p>"8.  That on March  26, 1910, the plaintiff, ceased to discharge the duties  of  the office of lieutenant  of  police of Albay, and, by the aforecited  resolution of the provincial board, is prevented from  holding  the said office in  the future.</p>
  <p>"9. That the municipal  council of  Albay resolved  not to  appeal, and  did not appeal, administratively to  the Honorable  Governor-General  from  the resolution of  the provincial  board, and  the  said council  does not permit nor will  it permit the plaintiff to occupy or again to take possession  of  the said  office.</p>
  <p>"10. That the  provincial  board is  disposed to carry out its resolution disapproving the appointment of the plaintiff, and to prevent the latter from continuing in the discharge of the  duties of the office of lieutenant of police.</p>
  <p>"11. Both  parties  agree,  furthermore, that the  court admit  and  consider  the  following  documents,  attached hereto and marked as Exhibits A, B,  C, D, E, F, G, H, and I."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Section 15  of the Election  Law  (Act  No. 1582)  contains the provision for the appointment of inspectors of elections, among other things.  Said section also provides that:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Said inspectors shall  be ineligible to be elected or appointed to any other office during their term of office."</p></blockquote>
<p>Said section further provides that the "inspectors of elections  *   *   *  shall hold office for two years," from the date of their appointment.</p>
<p>From the stipulated facts  above quoted,  it will be  seen that  the  plaintiff was appointed as election  inspector on the 13th  of September, 1909, and  resigned  on the 26th of February, 1910, and was appointed by the municipal president  as <em>"teniente de policia"</em> on the 21st of March,  1910, which appointment was approved by the municipal council on the 22d of March, 1910.  It will thus be seen that the plaintiff accepted  an appointive position within the period of two years  from the date of  his appointment as election inspector.  The provincial  board, upon  receiving notice of the appointment as "<em>teniente de policia</em>," immediately ordered the municipal  council to revoke the appointment, relying upon the provisions of section  15 above referred to. Immediately upon the revocation of said appointment, the plaintiff  presented a  petition  for  a  writ  of prohibition against the provincial board as well as the municipal council, to prevent them from carrying into effect  the said revocation.  The  lower  court  issued  said  writ.   From  that order the  defendants appealed to this court.</p>
<p>Several questions are presented by the brief filed by the Attorney-General.   The plaintiff presented no brief.</p>
<p>In  our  opinion  the  only  question which it  is necessary to discuss in the present  case is whether or not that provision of  section 15 which  provides that "said inspectors shall be ineligible  to be elected  or  appointed to any other office during their term of office," renders ineligible an inspector of elections from accepting an appointive office after the acceptance of his resignation and  within his "term of office" (two years).   Of course what is said here with reference to the acceptance of an appointive  office will also be applicable to the acceptance of an elective office.</p>
<p>The lower court reached the conclusion that said provision did not apply after the resignation of the inspector, and cited  in  support of that conclusion the case of Barnum <em>vs.</em> Gilman  (27 Minn., 466, decided March 29, 1881).  The constitution of the State of Minnesota, among other things, provides that - </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"No senator or representative (state)  shall, during the time for which he is elected, hold any office, under the authority of the United States, or the State of Minnesota, except that of postmaster."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In  that case (Barnum <em>vs.</em> Gilman)  the respondent was elected as lieutenant-governor of the State of Minnesota in the year 1879, for the term commencing January 1, 188O at the time of his nomination he was  holding  the office of representative in the legislature, under an election for the term  extending to the 1st of January, 1881; but prior to the said state election he resigned his office as representative and his resignation was duly accepted.   Mr. Justice Cornell, in writing the opinion in that case ;for the majority of the court, said;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"When he ceases to be such (senator or representative) whether by the lapse of time, resignation or otherwise, the disability terminates.  The  clause, 'during the time  for which he is elected can not  properly be construed as enlarging the scope of the prohibition so  as to include persons not in fact members of the legislature."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This case (Barnum <em>vs.</em> Gilman) has  been cited in support of the proposition that after the resignation of officers in- cluded in the provisions of the constitution, and the resignation is accepted, such persons are no longer  bound by such provisions.   We find, however, that this same question came before the  supreme court of the State of Minnesota again in the case of State vs. Sutton  (63  Minn., 147, decided December 12, 1895).  The supreme court of Minnesota, referring to the case of Barnum vs. Gilman, said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>"We must regard what was there said in reference to the constitutional provision here under consideration as mere obiter."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the case of State <em>vs.</em> Sutton, <em>supra</em>, the supreme court (of Minnesota) held that under this constitutional provision, the disability of a member of the legislature to hold office does not cease <em>until the expiration of the full period of time for which he was elected.</em><br>
  <br>
Even granting  that the decision in the case  of Barnum <em>vs.</em> Gilman decided that a senator or representative might be relieved from thje operation of,the constitutional provision by resigning, the same is expressly overruled in the case of State vs.  Sutton, supra.  In the latter case Mr.  Sutton was elected to the  office of  representative  on the 6th of November, 1894, for  the term commencing on the first Monday of January, 1895, and ending on the first Monday of January, 1897.  Pursuant to his election he.duly qualified and entered upon the discharge of his duties as such member and served until the 2d of May, 1895.  On the 4th of May, 1895, Mr. Sutton was appointed to the public office of inspector of boilers for the fourth congressional district, and qualified and entered upon the  performance of the duties of that office. Proceedings were  commenced to  oust him of his office and the court in deciding the case said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"We are of the opinion that the respondent, in holding the office of inspector of boilers, as charged in the writ of quo warranto, <em>comes within  the prohibition of the constitution (art.  4,  sec. 9),  and it is therefore adjudged that  said respondent, John B.  Sutton, is guilty of unlawfully  holding and exercising the  office of inspector of boilers for the fourth congressional district  in this state.  And it  is further ordered and adjudged that  said John B.  Sutton be ousted and excluded from said office of inspector of boilers and that judgment be entered accordingly."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The question which we are discussing here came before the supreme court of the State of Michigan in the case of Ellis <em>vs.</em> Lennon (86 Mich., 468, decided June term, 1891). In Michigan the general law for the incorporation of cities contains the following provision:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"No alderman shall be elected or appointed to any other office in the city <em>during the term for which he was  elected as alderman,</em> nor appointed to any other office in the city within one year thereafter."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The constitution of the State of Michigan also provides the following:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"No person elected a member of the legislature snail receive  any civil appointment within this State, or to  the Senate of the United States, from the governor, the governor and senate, from the legislature, or any other State authority, <em>during the term for which he is elected."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the said case of Ellis <em>vs.</em> Lennon supra, a member of the city council resigned his position and was appointed chief of police.   <em>Quo warranto</em>  proceedings were  commenced against him.  The supreme  court decided that:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"An alderman,   *  *  *,  can not, by resigning his office prior to the expiration of the term for which he was elected, render himself eligible to receive the appointment of chief of police."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the case of Waldo vs. Wallace (12 Ind., 569)  it appears that Wallace was mayor of the city of Indianapolis and that during the continuance of his term of office as such he resigned, became a candidate and received the highest number of votes for the office of sheriff of his county.  His right to hold the office of sheriff was presented  to the courts.  The court held that he could not exercise the duties of the office of sheriff,  for the reason that his election to the latter office occurred during the  continuance of his term  as mayor. (See also Gulick <em>vs.</em> New, 14 Ind.,  93.)</p>
<p>Provisions similar  to that contained in said  section  15 of Act No. 1582 are found in the constitutions of many of the States of the United States.   It is a common provision of municipal charters.  The purpose of such provision is to guard against trafficking in office and the further purpose is to remove from the incumbent of the office any inducement for causing a vacancy.   (Ellis <em>vs.</em> Lennon, 86 Mich., 468; Waldo <em>vs.</em> Wallace, 12 Ind., 569; Shelby <em>vs.</em> Alcorn, 36 Miss., 273; Sublett <em>vs.</em> Bedwell, 47 Miss., 266; Smith <em>vs.</em> Moore, 90 Ind.,  294; Story on Constitutional Law, sections 867-869.)</p>
<p>Another purpose for the existence of such constitutional or statutory provisions is to prevent officers  from using their official positions in the creation of offices for themselves, or for the appointment of themselves to other more lucrative positions.  The law of course  recognizes  the right of an official to resign under certain circumstances, but the policy of the law as announced in said section 15 of Act No. 1582 is to take away from public officials all inducements to  the vacation of their  office.   The  provision of said section 15 seems to be clear.  It says that  "said  inspectors  shall be ineligible to be elected or appointed during their term of office."   The time included within the phrase <em>"during their term  of office"</em> is  easy to compute.   Laws should be given their  natural interpretation.   Had the legislature intended that said inspectors  should  be ineligible  to be elected or appointed simply during the time  which they held the office of an inspector, the language of the  statute would have been  different.  The statute  naturally would  have read: "During the time they  continue  to  hold  the  office of  inspector." The statute, however,  is broader.  It used  the phrase  <em>"during their term of office.</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><em>"</em>  In reading said section  it will be noted that inspectors  of elections  are appointed for  a term of two  years.   Statutes should be construed so as to give  every word and  phrase  used its common and approved meaning.  If it had been the intention of the Legislature  to limit the prohibition to the term of actual service, or simply to make  inspectors of elections ineligible to other offices  during the term of  actual service, the phrase "during their term of office" would  have been substituted  by  the phrase  "during  the term  of  actual service."</p>
<p>For the foregoing reasons we are  fully persuaded that inspectors of  elections are ineligible  to be elected or  appointed to any other office during their term of office, and this prohibition is not limited to their term of actual service.</p>
<p>The judgment of the lower court  is therefore  hereby reversed and the defendants are absolved from any liability under the petition presented in the lower court for the writ of prohibition, with costs against the plaintiff.</p>

<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> After the beginning  of the present action (February  3, 1911), the  Philippine Legislature  amended  section  16  of Act No. 1582, so that said section, in part, now reads as follows:
<blockquote>
  <p>"Any  person appointed as inspector, who accepts appointment and qualifies  for the office,  shall be ineligible to be  elected or  ap- pointed to any other office <em>during the entire  time for which he  was appointed as such inspector."</em>  (Sec. 8, Act No.  2045.)</p>
