				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from an order sustaining a motion to quash an execution 
sued out by the plaintiffs against Simeon Bias, a surety upon one of the appeal 
bonds furnished by the defendants and appellants in the course of a former 
appeal from a judgment entered in this cause. The motion is based upon the 
ground that execution was issued for an amount in excess of that for which the 
surety is liable upon his bond.
<p>It appears that on November 28,1906, plaintiffs instituted this action and 
that on November 30, 1908, the Court of First Instance of Manila rendered a 
decree ordering substantially :</p>
<p>1. That the real property involved in the action be transferred by Cho Jan 
Ling to the persons therein found to be the owners.</p>
<p>2. That Cho Jan Ling render unto his co-owners account of his administration 
of the property from May, 1905, until the appointment of a receiver in this 
action.</p>
<p>3. That Cho Jan Ling pay over the sum of P24,155.95 in his possession as 
rents prior to May, 1905.</p>
<p>4. That the receiver render his final accounts. </p>
<p>The decree terminates with the words: "And when said final account shall have 
been rendered the, court will make the necessary orders (resolvera lo que 
proceda) in accordance with the determinations of this decree."</p>
<p>From this decree an appeal was prosecuted to the Supreme Court of the 
Philippine Islands, and for the purposes of the appeal the defendants furnished 
bond in the following terms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Whereas in the above-entitled cause the plaintiffs have filed a complaint 
against the defendants for the recovery of certain property and of the rents 
accruing therefrom;</p>
<p>"Whereas judgment was rendered in said cause ordering the defendant Cho Jan 
Ling to pay the plaintiffs the sum of twenty-four thousand, one hundred 
fifty-five pesos and ninety-five centavos (P24,155.95) and to transfer said 
property to the association formed by said plaintiffs and defendants, with the 
exception of the Cho Chun Chac, and to pay the costs of suit, and furthermore to 
render accounts of his administration of said property;</p>
<p>"Whereas said defendant interposed an appeal from said judgment to the 
Supreme Court of these Islands, which was admitted by said court, upon condition 
that execution of said judgment might be issued unless bond, sufficient in the 
opinion of the court, be given to assure the fulfillment of said judgment in 
case the same should be affirmed, wholly or in part;</p>
<p>"Therefore we, Cho Jan Ling, as principal, and Dona Severina Lerma, with the 
assent of her spouse Don Manuel Almeda, and Don Simeon Blas, as sureties, hereby 
jointly and severally obligate ourselves to pay to the plaintiffs the sum of 
sixty thousand pesos (P60,000) to guarantee that said defendants will comply 
with said judgment in case the same be wholly or partially affirmed by the 
Supreme Court and the costs which may be taxed by reason of the appeal 
interposed.</p>
<p>"Signed and sealed at Manila, January 18, 1909.—CHO JAN LING.—SIMEON BLAS.—S. 
L. DE ALMEDA.—MANUEL ALMEDA."</p></blockquote>
<p>Upon appeal the judgment was affirmed.<span class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> Thereafter, in the Court of First Instance 
further proceedings were had in the cause, in which the defendant Cho Jan Ling 
was required to render, and did render, accounts of his administration of the 
properties in question, all in compliance with the terms of the decree of 
November 30, 1908, thus affirmed on appeal At the close of these further 
proceedings it was found and decided that Cho Jan Ling was indebted to the 
plaintiffs to the amount of P18,313.34.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs then sued out execution against Simeon Bias, one of the sureties 
upon the bond of January 18, 1909, and included in their execution the full 
amount of the liability of Cho Jan Ling to the plaintiffs—that is to say, not 
only the P24,155,95, interest and costs which Simeon' Blas guaranteed as surety 
on said bond, but also the further amount of P18,313.34 and interest which Cho 
Jan Ling was long subsequently condemned to pay. The motion to quash the 
execution as to the excess over the contractual obligation of the surety, Blas, 
was granted, and plaintiffs have appealed.</p>
<p>Upon this statement of the facts of the case we agree with the trial judge, 
who held as follows;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I am of the opinion that the sureties upon the appeal bond of Cho Jan Ling, 
conditioned that the defendant should comply with the judgment entered if it was 
confirmed, can not be called upon as sureties to satisfy any judgment 
subsequently entered. The conditions of the bond were that he should pay a sum 
of money, transfer some property and render an accounting. This does not include 
the condition that the sureties would pay any amount which might be found due 
upon the accounting. The liability of the sureties is limited to that which is 
specifically stated in the bond, and their contract has been complied with, with 
the exception of the payment of the sum of P24,155.95, as stated.</p>
<p>" It was error to issue the execution against the sureties for the amount of 
the subsequent judgment."</p></blockquote>
<p>The real question involved in this appeal is one of interpretation of the 
terms of the bond, which must be construed in the light of the Civil Code 
provision that: "Security is not presumed; it must be express and cannot be 
extended further than that specified therein." (Art. 1827.)</p>
<p>Appeal bonds are ordinarily given to secure the fulfillment of final 
judgments, and the measure of the surety's liability is ordinarily the amount of 
the final judgment rendered in the case in the course of which the appeal arose. 
But the appeal in this case appears to have been taken, without objection from 
any of the parties, from a judgment which by its very terms was not final, in 
that it did not dispose of all the issues raised by the pleadings. It may well 
be that had the plaintiff stood upon his rights, the former appeal would not 
have been allowed until a final judgment had been entered; or, if allowed, that 
an appeal bond would have been required which would have secured the payment of 
any amount which might be found due under the accounting. But since plaintiff 
went forward at that time without insisting upon his rights, and accepted 
without objection an appeal bond which did not in express terms or by necessary 
implication secure to him all that he might have demanded, he will not now be 
permitted to read into the bond a provision which he did not then insist 
upon.</p>
<p>Of course the liability of Cho Jan Ling was not terminated by merely 
rendering the accounts on which, under the terms of the original decree, 
judgment for P18,813.34 was there-after entered against him. But the question 
here is not as to the liability of Cho Jan Ling, The question before us is as to 
the liability assumed by the sureties on the bond. Cho Jan Ling's liability is 
wholly independent of the bond, while theirs is strictly limited by its terms. 
Hence, while we agree with counsel for appellants, and the cases cited by him, 
that the duty of guardians, trustees, administrators and the like to account for 
the funds which come into their hands is not finally fulfilled by the mere 
preparation of a statement of the amount of their receipts and disbursements, so 
long as any funds remain in their hands, we by no means agree with him that 
because this duty rested upon Cho Jan Ling it necessarily rested on the sureties 
on his appeal bond.</p>
<p>The sureties on the appeal bond guaranteed merely that Cho Jan Ling would 
comply with the judgment requiring him "to render his final accounts;" not that 
he would do what he was and is morally bound to do, that is, to account for and 
turn over all the funds of plaintiff in his possession. The judgment, compliance 
with which was guaranteed by the sureties, did not in itself provide for the 
turning over of the balance due as a result of the accounting. For that purpose 
the entry of a new decree was necessary. The sureties on the appeal bond neither 
expressly nor impliedly undertook to guarantee compliance with any other 
judgment than that already entered when the instrument was executed.</p>
<p>The order entered in the court below should be affirmed, with the costs of 
this instance against the appellants. So ordered.</p>
