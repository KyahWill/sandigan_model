				<BR><STRONG>MORELAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of the Province of Leyte,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Hon. Mariano Cui presiding, ordering the defendant to deliver possession of the lands described in the complaint of the plaintiff&nbsp; and to pay to her as damages for the&nbsp; wrongful detention of the same&nbsp; the sum of P1,375, with costs.<br><br>Without discussing the merits, we are&nbsp; of the opinion that,&nbsp; while&nbsp; defendant's motion, consented to by Francisco Galos, asking leave to bring&nbsp; in said Francisco Galos under the provisions of section 121 of the Code&nbsp; of Civil Procedure, and which,&nbsp; for his full protection under the provisions of articles 1478 to 1483, inclusive, of the Civil Code, he ought to do, should&nbsp; have been granted.&nbsp; This&nbsp; motion was somewhat late; not enough, however, to&nbsp; prejudice the plaintiff. The&nbsp; proofs&nbsp; already presented by the plaintiff&nbsp; may stand as if taken on the retrial, he having the privilege of presenting such other proofs as he may deem advisable.<br><br>The oral&nbsp; proofs of both parties&nbsp; are&nbsp; scanty and some what&nbsp; vague and&nbsp; unsatisfactory.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the new trial&nbsp; care should be taken&nbsp; to make the&nbsp; proofs clear&nbsp; and definite. When, in&nbsp; the course of the examination of a witness, an exhibit is&nbsp; presented to him by counsel for any purpose, that exhibit should be specifically described and identified so that&nbsp; when the evidence arrives here on appeal this court may. know to what particular exhibit counsel and the&nbsp; witness&nbsp;&nbsp; are&nbsp; referring&nbsp; in&nbsp; their&nbsp; questions&nbsp; and&nbsp; answers.&nbsp; In several&nbsp; places in the evidence now&nbsp; before us counsel and witness, in questions and answers,&nbsp; speak of and refer to exhibits without identifying them.&nbsp; It is utterly impossible&nbsp; for us to know to what exhibits they were referring1.&nbsp; As a necessary consequence, such evidence is wholly worthless.<br><br>Moreover, when there is presented in evidence an exhibit written in&nbsp; any language other than Spanish, if there is an appeal,&nbsp; that exhibit should&nbsp; be translated into Spanish by the official interpreter of the court, or a translation should be&nbsp; agreed&nbsp; upon by the&nbsp; parties, and both original and&nbsp; translation sent to this court.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the&nbsp; case&nbsp; before us there is an untranslated exhibit written in&nbsp; the Visayan language.<br><br>The judgment of the learned&nbsp; trial court is set&nbsp; aside and the&nbsp; cause&nbsp; remanded for&nbsp; a new&nbsp; trial, with the privilege to the appellant to bring in as a party Francisco Galos, in accordance with the provisions&nbsp; of law above referred to.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J., Mapa,&nbsp; Carson,</i> and <i>Trent, JJ.,</i>&nbsp; concur.<br></div>
