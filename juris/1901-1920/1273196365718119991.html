				<BR><STRONG>STREET, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This appeal is brought to this Court to reverse a judgment of the Court of 
First Instance of the Province of Antique, adjudging the defendant guilty of 
tlje crime of murder and sentencing him to <em>cadena perpetua</em>, with the 
accessories provided by law, and requiring him to indemnify the heirs of the 
deceased in the sum of P1,000, and to pay the costs.
<p>It appears in evidence that between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening of 
February 24, 1917, the deceased, Damiano Jordan, and a neighbor, one Fernando 
Martinez, were talking with each other while standing in the street immediately 
in front of Jordan's house in the municipality of Sibalom, Province of Antique. 
While they were so engaged in conversation they were approached by the accused, 
Ponciano Namit. The latter was at the time apparently entering upon duty as a 
guard of the round in the capacity of substitute for a son whose turn fell upon 
this night.</p>
<p>As Ponciano Namit came up he stopped and asked Fernando Martinez if he was on 
guard that night. Upon receiving an affirmative reply, he asked Damiano Jordan 
if he too was on guard, and Damiano replied that he was not as it was not his 
turn. Ponciano thereupon at once ordered Damiano to go up into his house, and as 
Damiano did not instantly obey, Ponciano in a few moments repeated the command. 
Damiano then replied that he was going, and suiting his actions to his words, 
turned to start for his house. As he was turning, Ponciano struck him a blow on 
the left frontal part of the head with a heavy stick.</p>
<p>The end of this stick was supplied with a hatchet-shaped object, possibly of 
metal, and the knob of this instrument crushed into the head of Damiano and, 
penetrating into the brain, there momentarily remained. Ponciano by giving the 
stick a jerk succeeded in freeing it and immediately left the scene of the 
crime. When he pulled the stick out, Damiano fell to the ground. Damiano's wife 
who was sitting in the door of their house only a short distance away, saw what 
had happened and immediately ran down to her husband and told Fernando to aid 
her in carrying him to the house, which he did. The injured person lived for 
about six days and died as a result of the wound. It was shown by an autopsy 
performedon the body that a hole was made in the skull about as large as a half 
peso coin. No motive sufficient to account for this unjustifiable attack was 
proved, though there is a suggestion in the evidence that Ponciano may have been 
drinking.</p>
<p>After a careful review of the evidence we see no reason for discrediting the 
testimony of the two eyewitnesses for the prosecution. We find no material 
contradiction in their statements made either at the trial of this case or at 
the time of the commission of the crime. The story told by the wife of the 
deceased, Bonifacia Tubigon, appears to be a simple and truthful narrative. The 
same may be said with regard to the testimony of Fernando Martinez. Both 
witnesses apparently evince a desire to tell what happened without exaggeration 
or distortion. Another witness for the prosecution, Aurelio Sildo, testified 
that on the night in question the accused admitted that he had the misfortune to 
strike Damiano Jordan.</p>
<p>At the trial the accused did not directly admit having struck the fatal blow 
to Damiano; but he claimed that on the night in question he was passing the 
place of this occurrence and was there assaulted by some unknown person with a 
stick. He says that he and the assailant struggled for the possession of the 
stick and that finally he, Ponciano, kicked his adversary, who fell down, 
whereupon Ponciano departed. We consider this story unlikely; and the judge of 
the trial court was, we think, fully justified in finding, as he did, that the 
accused is the person who caused the death of Damiano Jordan.</p>
<p>Although the complaint charges <em>alevosia</em> (treachery) as a qualifying 
circumstance in the commission of the crime, thus elevating the offense to the 
degree of murder, and although the judge of the trial court found that this 
element was present in the commission of the offense, we are not satisfied with 
his conclusion on this point. It is true the two principal witnesses testify 
that the blow was given after Damiano Jordan had turned his back to the accused; 
but the blow was struck, evidently with great force, upon the left frontal side 
of the head of Damiano, and it is manifest that this could have been done only 
if the accused is a left-handed person, supposing him to be standing behind his 
victim. There is no evidence, however, that Ponciano Namit is left-handed; and 
inasmuch as righthandedness prevails among the great majority, it is to be 
presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the accused is 
right-handed.</p>
<p>This circumstance raises in our mind a reasonable doubt as to whether the 
parties may not have been facing each other when the blow was delivered. If such 
were the case, it would be improper to find that the offense was qualified by 
<em>alevosia</em>. It must be admitted that the attack was sudden and unexpected 
to Damiano Jordan, and it would perhaps be possible to found upon this the 
conclusion that the attack was characterized by surprise in such sense as to 
constitute <em>alevosia</em>. However, in considering a question of this kind, 
every case must be judged by its particular facts; and we find nothing in the 
evidence to show with certainty that the aggressor consciously adopted a mode of 
attack intended to facilitate the perpetration of a homicide without risk to 
himself. A more reasonable, though still doubtful, inference would possibly be 
that he did not in fact intend to kill Damiano at all.</p>
<p>In this connection it is worth while to note that Bonifacia Tubigon declares 
that immediately after the blow was struck Ponciano Namit exclaimed "I have long 
desired to strike some one and I have done so." ("Yo desde antes tenia ganas de 
pegar a alguien, y he pegado.") This would seem to indicate, in the absence of 
proof of other motive, that the accused was moved by a sudden desire to use his 
stick and that he struck in obedience to this unreasoning impulse, without 
thinking of the conditions under which he was acting. Upon the whole we incline 
to the opinion that the fatal blow was the result of a casual encounter under 
conditions not sufficiently defined to enable us to say that <em>alevosia</em> 
was certainly present in the case.</p>
<p>The offense committed is, in our opinion, to be qualified as homicide, under 
article 404 of the Penal Code, in the estimation of which no generic 
circumstance either of an aggravating or attenuating nature should be taken into 
consideration; and the proper penalty is <em>reclusion temporal</em> in its 
medium degree. The accused should accordingly be sentenced to 14 years 8 months 
and 1 day, <em>reclusion temporal</em>, with the accessories prescribed in 
article 59 of the Penal Code.</p>
<p>Another feature of the case of some importance is presented in connection 
with an attachment levied upon the property of the accused to secure the 
satisfaction of the civil liability incident to the commission of the homicide. 
It appears that while the cause was pending in the Court of First Instance an 
attorney appeared in the capacity of private proseeutor, representing the widow 
of the deceased, and presented an affidavit showing that the accused was selling 
his property in order to elude the payment of any indemnity to which he would be 
liable in case of conviction. It was accordingly requested that an attachment 
should be issued against his property. An order was thereupon made by the court 
upon April 25, 1917, authorizing an attachment of property to the value of 
P1,500, unless he should give bond to answer in that amount. The clerk of the 
court issued the order of attachment upon the same date, and three days later 
the court rendered its decision finding the accused guilty and ordering him to 
indemnify the widow and children of the deceased in the sum of P1,000. The 
attachment was not immediately levied; but after an appeal had been taken, the 
sheriff, on November 28, 1917, levied the same upon five parcels of land and a 
house belonging to the accused. It does not appear from the record in this case 
whether the accused has ever given the bond necessary to procure the dissolution 
of this attachment, although upon December 19, 1917, after the cause had been 
brought to this Court by appeal, an order was here entered authorizing the Court 
of First Instance to act in the matter of dissolving the attachment, if bond 
should be given.</p>
<p>It is argued that the attachment granted in this case is sustainable under 
article 589 of the Law of Criminal Procedure of Spain, which is to the following 
effect:</p>
<p>"Art. 589. When from the record of a cause appear circumstances tending to 
establish the guilt of a person, the judge shall require him to give a bond 
sufficient to secure the pecuniary liabilities which may be finally adjudged, 
ordering in the same decree the attachment of sufficient property to cover such 
liabilities, should he fail to give bond.</p>
<p>"The amount of the bond shall be fixed in the same decree and it shall not be 
less than one third of the probable amount of the pecuniary liabilities."</p>
<p>We are of the opinion that this provision and those related to it in the 
Spanish Code of Criminal Procedure were abrogated by necessary implication upon 
the enactment of General Orders No. 58. It is true that section 107 of this law 
recognizes the existence of the civil liability connected with the commission of 
crime and reserves "the privileges" previously secured by law to the person 
injured by the commission of an offense to take part in the prosecution and to 
recover damages. Nevertheless, we think that the word "privilege," as here used, 
cannot be understood as referring to the procedure contained in the Spanish Code 
of Criminal Procedure relating to the attachment of property and giving of 
bond.</p>
<p>Upon reading the entire section 107 of General Orders No. 58, it appears 
obvious that the right which was intended to be saved by the reservation therein 
made was the right of the party injured to appear and to be heard in all stages 
of the case with reference to such liability and to obtain a judgment for the 
damages occasioned by the wrongful act, as well as the further right to appeal 
from any decision of the court denying any legal right connected therewith.</p>
<p>It is to be noted that while the "sumario" of Spanish criminal procedure is 
in many respects similar to the preliminary hearing before a committing 
magistrate conducted pursuant to sections 13 and 14 of General Orders No. 58, 
there is nevertheless an important difference, which is that the "sumario" 
constitutes a preliminary stage in the criminal prosecution, and is not merely a 
step preparatory to the initiation of the proceedings. The evidence taken in the 
"sumario" was, therefore, capable of being used in the plenary stage of the 
prosecution; and if ratification was not required, served as the basis of 
judgment. (<em>Ley de 18 de junio de 1870</em>—Law of June 18,1870.) On the 
contrary, the proceedings in the preliminary hearing never constitute a basis 
for a subsequent judicial declaration of guilt. The "sumario" has been abrogated 
by the enactment of General Orders No. 58, above referred to; and the ground 
expressed in article 589 of the Spanish Code of Criminal Procedure for the 
attachment of the property of the accused therefore no longer here exists.</p>
<p>With the adoption of General Orders No. 58, there was necessarily introduced 
into these Islands a system of criminal procedure embodying the principles 
recognized in the system of criminal procedure generally in vogue in the United 
States; and any characteristic or rule of the former system inconsistent with 
these principles must be held to have been abrogated. Attachment in American law 
is a purely statutory remedy. It does not exist unless expressly given by 
statute and as it is an extraordinary and summary remedy, it is unavailable 
except in those cases where the statute expressly permits its issuance.</p>
<p>It remains to consider whether or not the attachment can be sustained under 
the provisions of section 424, in connection with subsection 5 of section 412 of 
the Code of Civil Procedure. The affidavit made in this case states 
substantially, we think, that the accused was selling his property with the 
intent to defraud the persons interested in the enforcement of the civil 
liability; but considered as an application for an attachment under the 
provisions above cited, in connection with section 426 of the same Code, the 
affidavit was in several respects defective. Disregarding these informalities, 
however, we are of the opinion that the remedy of attachment there provided is 
not available as an aid to the enforcement of the civil liability incident to 
prosecution for crime. These provisions contemplate the pendency of a civil 
action, and the remedy of attachment is merely an auxiliary to such action. 
Section 795 of the Code of Civil Procedure, in its first paragraph, declares 
that the procedure in all civil actions shall be in accordance with the 
provisions of said Code; and it is quite evident that the Legislature in 
adopting this Code could not have intended to make its provisions in any respect 
applicable to the proceedings in a criminal prosecution. The mere circumstance 
that a civil liability can be made the subject of recovery in a criminal 
prosecution is in our opinion no sufficient reason for holding that the remedy 
of attachment as designated for use in a civil action is available in the 
criminal proceeding.</p>
<p>From what has been said it results that the attachment effected under the 
order of the Court of First Instance dated April 25, 1917, must be considered to 
have been improvidently granted. The same is hereby declared to be of no effect, 
but this declaration will of course in no wise prejudice the right of the widow 
and children of the deceased to enforce the payment of the indemnity for which 
judgment was rendered against the accused. The judgment of the trial court, in 
respect to the penalty imposed upon the accused, is modified by substituting 14 
years 8 months and 1 day, <em>reclusion temporal</em>, with the accessories 
prescribed in article 59 of the Penal Code for so much thereof as imposes the 
penalty of <em>cadena perpetua</em>, with the accessories prescribed in article 
54 of the same Code. As thus modified the judgment of the lower court is 
affirmed, with costs against the appellant. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Johnson, Avanceña,</em> and <em>Fisher, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>

<p align="center"><em><strong>DISSENTING OPINION</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>MALCOLM, J.</strong>, <em>dissenting in part:</em></p>
<p>I agree with the main decision in its discussion of the facts and its 
qualification of the crime. I agree again that article 589 of the law of 
Criminal Procedure of Spain was necessarily abrogated upon the promulgation of 
General Orders No. 58. I do not agree with the proposition that attachment 
cannot be levied upon the property of the accused to secure the satisfaction of 
the civil liability incident to the commission of the homicide. In my judgment 
such action is both legal and proper.</p>
<p>The law of the Philippine Islands is made up of certain parts which we call 
statutes or codes. Yet this law is, if we interpret it understandingly, a 
harmonious and symmetrical system. To give unity to the whole, it is essential 
to visualize the law in its entirety and not as isolated segments. Even as to 
the codes, none is sufficient unto itself. For convenience each code is given a 
title which it treats of fully, but never completely. Each code necessarily must 
and should blend into every other code. To borrow a phrase of statutory 
construction, codes are in a sense <em>in pari materia</em>. For one to 
enumerate examples would be to demonstrate the obvious.</p>
<p>There is no doubt as to the civil liability of a person for his criminal 
acts. To follow the doctrine laid down by Justice Torres in the United States 
vs. Bernardo ( [1911], 19 Phil., 265) :</p>
<p>"Every crime or misdemeanor gives rise to a penal or criminal action for the 
punishment of the guilty party, and also to a civil action for the restitution 
of the thing, repair of the damage, and indemnification for the losses; 
wherefore, after the prosecution of the criminal action, it shall be understood 
that the civil action has been utilized, for the reason that every person 
criminally liable for a crime or misdemeanor is also civilly liable (art. 17, 
Penal Code), unless the aggrieved party should expressly waive his right (art. 
23)." (<em>Syllabus</em>.)</p>
<p>When, therefore, in a criminal action the courts are permitted to give 
judgment for a civil indemnity, they necessarily must have the power to make 
this remedy effective. This can only be done by going to the Code of Civil 
Procedure, which contains the appropriate provisions governing the subject of 
attachment. It would seem to be self-evident that the property of the aecused 
should be kept intact to satisfy the civil judgment. Any other hypothesis would 
permit the accused to dispose of his property in order to escape the fulfillment 
of the entire judgment and to defeat the purposes of the law.</p>
<p>With the exception above noted, the judgment is correct.</p></div>
