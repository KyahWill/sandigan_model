				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This appeal presents for resolution the question of whether or not fish are 
an agricultural product.
<p align="center">FACTS.</p>
<p>The facts are not in dispute. Plaintiff is the owner of various fish ponds 
(<em>pesquerias</em>) in the municipality of Bulacan, Province of Bulacan. 
Between January 1 and September 30, 1915, plaintiff consigned to a commission 
merchant in Manila quantities of fish which sold for P5,264.89. The commission 
merchant paid the merchant's percentage and fixed taxes due under the Internal 
Revenue Law. Plaintiff, however, had not previously paid the merchant's tax, 
although from August 1, 1904, the date when the first Internal Revenue Law 
became effective, until October 26, 1915, plaintiff had been engaged in this 
business. Plaintiff had paid the real estate tax on the land upon: which the 
fishponds are located. On the date last mentioned, on demand of a representative 
of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, plaintiff paid under protest P71.81, the 
total internal-revenue tax on the gross sum received for the first 
three-quarters of the year 1915. The ground of the protest was that plaintiff is 
an agriculturist and not a merchant and therefore exempt from the taxes imposed 
by the Internal Revenue Law upon the gross sales of merchants. The protest was 
denied by the Collector of Internal Revenue, who held that the plaintiff was a 
merchant. Suit to recover this amount of P71.81 was thereupon instituted in the 
Court of First Instance of the city of Manila against the defendant as collector 
of internal revenue. After trial on an agreed statement of facts, the Honorable 
Jose Abreu in a carefully prepared decision ordered defendant to refund the 
P71.81 paid by plaintiff as internal-revenue taxes and penalties under protest, 
with legal interest thereon from November 26, 1915, the date of such payment 
under protest. Defendant appealed making four assignments of error, all of 
which, however, with the exception of the last, which need not be considered, 
center around the question which we set out in the beginning of this decision. 
Both appellee and appellant have further favored the court with an exceptionally 
able presentation of their respective contentions. We are given to understand 
that this is in the nature of a test case, concerning not alone the 
comparatively small amount involved but afiecting the taxes of numerous other 
persons in an amount which will run up into thousands of pesos.</p>
<p>In addition to the foregoing statement of the case, we must note the nature 
of the fishponds and of the fish. As to the first, before the lands are suitable 
for use as fishponds, it is necessary for the land to be prepared by the 
erection of dykes and cleaning out and deepening the bottom. The presence of 
caretakers is necessary to see that the fishponds do not become damaged and to 
regulate the entrance and exit of water through the floodgates. The fish are of 
the species known <em>bangus</em>. These fish are obtained from small fishes 
(<em>semillas</em>), which are placed in the fishponds. These small fishes are 
first put in a comparatively small compartment, surrounded by walls of earth, 
which is found within the fishery itself. Afterwards when they get to be about 
the size of a cigarette, they are let loose into the other compartments of the 
same fishery. This compartment for <em>semillas</em> is allowed to dry and is 
cleaned well before the <em>semillas</em> are placed therein; it is even plowed 
to kill all the bugs that may eat up the fish. In order to make marine plants 
grow, a small amount of sea water is allowed to enter. When the fish have become 
large an endeavor is made to fill the fishery with water. From time to time the 
water contained in the fishery is renewed to avoid the killing of the fish. The 
walls of a fishery are constructed to preserve and to retain the water and the 
fishes inside the fishery. These walls are constructed on swampy lands and in 
some cases on rice fields bounded by a river or the sea.</p>
<p>The food of the <em>bangus</em> includes marine plants. These algae are of 
seven classes, their scientific names being cladophora, chaetomorpha, 
oscillatoria, oedogonium, lyngbya, enteromorpha, and najas. One of these plants 
is rooted. Some of the others are very loosely attached to the ground, but not 
rooted. Generally the algae float in the water.</p>
<p align="center">LAW.</p>
<p>The provisions of the law which it is necessary to construe are not 
extensive. The different internal-revenue laws have provided for a merchant's 
tax. "Merchant," as used in the law, "means a person engaged in the sale, 
barter, or exchange of personal property of whatever character." (Act No. 2339, 
sec. 40; Administrative Code [1917] sec. 1459.) The succeeding section (Act No. 
2339, sec. 41; Administrative Code [1917], sec. 1460) is entitled "Sales not 
subject to merchant's tax." The section provides:</p>
<p>"In computing the tax above imposed transactions in the following commodities 
shall be excluded: * * *.</p>
<p>"(<em>c</em>) Agricultural products when sold by the producer or owner of the 
land where grown, whether in their original state or not."</p>
<p>With the facts and the law before us, we return to the question first 
suggested.</p>
<p align="center">QUESTION.</p>
<p>Are fish an agricultural product within the meaning of the exemption 
provisions of the Internal Revenue Law?</p>
<p align="center">OPINION.</p>
<p>Different methods of approach to this question are possible. For example, all 
argument could be disposed of peremptorily with the bald statement that in 
accordance with the rule of <em>stare decisis</em>, the decision of this court 
in The United States <em>vs</em>. Laxa ([1917], 36 Phil. Rep., 670) is decisive. 
Justice Araullo, in his opinion, held that fish are not an agricultural product, 
that the owner of a fishpond who sells the fish at the fishpond is a merchant, 
that such a merchant is not entitled to the exemption provided by the Internal 
Revenue Law, and that the said owner is guilty of violation of the Internal 
Revenue Law. We prefer not to take such a stand, although we are confident that 
it could be defended, because of the vigorous objection to a decision in a 
criminal prosecution becoming a precedent in a civil action for the recovery of 
taxes.</p>
<p>As opposed to the Laxa decision, counsel for plaintiff invites special 
attention to the cases of Mapa <em>vs</em>. Insular Government ([1908] 10 Phil., 
175) and Mercado <em>vs</em>. Collector of Internal Revenue ([1915] 32 Phil. 
Rep., 271). In the first case, the Supreme Court said—</p>
<p>"The question before us is not what is agricultural land, but what definition 
has been given to that phrase by the Act of Congress."</p>
<p>The Philippine Bill, it was found, classified land as agricultural public 
land in order to distinguish such land from timber or mineral land. Neither 
Congress nor the court gave any definition of agricultural land as such or of 
the products of the land. Moreover, the court made the observation that, "The 
land in question in this case, which is used as a fishery, could be filled up 
and any kind of crops raised thereon." If the case can be considered as an 
authority, it must be that the court recognizes that agricultural land, as the 
term is used in the Act of Congress, may be devoted to other than agricultural 
purposes, and that using agricultural land for a fishpond is a use other than 
agricultural. In the second case of Mercado vs. Collector of Internal Revenue, 
following Mapa vs. Insular Government (supra), the Court said—</p>
<p>"It is, then, unquestionable that <em>bakawan</em> firewood is an 
agricultural product, differing from other kinds of firewood obtained from 
forest trees because the <em>bakawan</em> plant grows only on lands subject to 
overflow, which require clearing and care by workers skilled in agricultural 
pursuits, in order that it may thrive. It is also to be noted that up to the 
present time mangrove swamps have been found suitable for no other useful 
crop."</p>
<p>But it is plainly a far cry from a holding that <em>bakawan</em>, planted and 
grown through the culture of the soil, is an agricultural product, to finding 
that fish are in a similar sense planted and grown as a result of the culture of 
the soil. Whatever comfort can be derived from these decisions as persuasive 
authority is more than nullified by the later case of The United States 
<em>vs</em>. Laxa ([1917] 36 Phil. Rep., 670)."</p>
<p>Just, therefore, as the facts and the law are indisputable, so do we prefer 
to forget these three cases for the time being and to rest our decision on the 
plain and ordinary meaning of the law as disclosed by the elementary rules of 
statutory construction.</p>
<p>And first, in order to dispose of the question, is the owner of a fishpond, 
such as the plaintiff, who sells fish taken from a fishpond, a "merchant" as 
defined in the Internal Revenue Law? Recalling this definition of a "merchant," 
it would appear undeniable that the plaintiff is properly included in such 
classification. To paraphrase the law, <em>he is a person engaged in the sale of 
fish</em>. Under our law, whatever may be the usual conception of a merchant, 
buying <em>and</em> selling are not essential; <em>to sell only is 
sufficient</em>. (<em>See also In re</em> Cameron Town Mut. Fire, Lightning 
&amp; Windstorm Ins. Co. [1899], 96 Fed., 756.)</p>
<p>If such a man is a merchant, does his sale of fish place him under the 
exemption of the Internal Revenue Law? We know the meaning of "fish." In the 
authoritative work by Dr. C. L. G. Gunther on the Study of Fishes, we find the 
following:</p>
<p>"According to the views generally adopted at present, all those vertebrate 
animals are referred to the class of fishes, which, living in water, breathe air 
dissolved in water by means of gills or branchiae; whose heart consists of a 
single ventricle and single atrium; whose limbs, if present, are modified into 
fins, supplemented by unpaired, median fins; and whose skin is either naked, or 
covered with scales or osseous plates or bucklers * * *."</p>
<p>We then have left to define merely the words "agricultural products."</p>
<p>"Agriculture" is defined by Webster as "the art or science of cultivating the 
ground, including the preparation of the soil, the planting of seeds, the 
raising and harvesting of crops, and the rearing, feeding, and management of 
live stock." Let us test our facts by this definition. The ground of the 
fishpond is cultivated. The soil is prepared. We, however, greatly doubt that 
seeds (of fish) are planted or that crops (of fish) are raised and harvested. 
Certainly, the seeds of fish are not sown in the ground as one would sow corn, 
while as distinguished from the rearing, feeding, and management of live stock, 
which consumes the products of the farm, the fish living in water depending upon 
water for life, only receive nourishment from marine. plants most of which have 
little or no connection with the land.</p>
<p>To proceed. The equivalent of "agriculture" in "husbandry." And "husbandry" 
is defined by Webster as "the business of a farmer, comprehending agriculture or 
tillage of the ground, the raising, managing, and fattening of cattle and other 
domestic animals, the management of the dairy and whatever the land produces." 
Again, we are far from confident that a farmer is generally understood to be a 
fisherman, and that the land can be said to produce fish. In a case in which 
these definitions were considered, the supreme court of Tennessee said that 
"agriculture" means "in its original sense, the cultivation of the ground for 
the purpose of procuring vegetables and fruits for the use of man and beast, or 
the act of preparing the soil, sowing and planting seeds, dressing the plants, 
and removing the crops. In this sense the word includes gardening or 
horticulture, and also the raising and feeding of cattle or stock ; but in a 
more common and appropriate sense is used to signify that specie of cultivation 
which is intended to raise grain and other field crops for man and beast." 
(Simons <em>vs</em>. Lovell [1872], 54 Tenn. [7 Heisk.], 510; <em>see also In 
re</em> Drake [1902], 114 Fed., 229.)</p>
<p>To proceed. "Agricultural products," the supreme court of Georgia has held, 
"in ordinary usage," is confined to the yield of the soil, as corn, wheat, rye, 
hay, etc. (Davis &amp; Co. <em>vs</em>. Mayor and Council of Macon [1879], 64 
Ga., 128.) The court had here to determine if beef cattle were exempt from 
taxation as "an agricultural product." The court asked—</p>
<p>"And when it is thought of closely, would it not be rather an unusual 
application of the phrase 'agricultural products' to make it comprehend beef 
cattle? In ordinary usage, is not that phrase confined to the yield of the soil, 
as corn, wheat, rye, oats, hay, etc., in its primary form? When there has been 
conversion of the fruits of the soil into animal tissues are we still to apply 
the phrase ? And suppose we are to disregard the change in its first stage, and 
call a cow or a steer an agricultural product, must we carry the name forward to 
the steak or roast which the butcher sells us from the slaughtered animal? If 
cattle fall under the denomination, so do hogs; and if beef, so does bacon." 
(<em>See also</em> State <em>vs</em>. Patterson [1887], 4 S. E., 47.)</p>
<p>Another case, coming from the supreme court of the District of Columbia, 
gives a much broader meaning to the phrase. (District of Columbia <em>vs</em>. 
Oyster [1885], 54 Am. Rep., 275.) The court said—</p>
<p>"The common parlance of the country, and the common practice of the country, 
have been to consider all those things as farming products or agricultural 
products which had the <em>situs</em> of their production upon the farm, and 
which were brought into condition for the uses of society by the labor of those 
engaged in agricultural pursuits, as contra-distinguished from manufacturing or 
other industrial pursuits. The product of the dairy or the product of the 
poultry yard, while it does not come directly out of the soil, is necessarily 
connected with the soil and with those who are engaged in the culture of the 
soil. It is, in every sense of the word, a part of the farm product. It is 
depended upon and looked upon as one of the results and one of the means of 
income of the farm, and in a just sense, therefore, it may be considered 
produce."</p>
<p>To indicate further the wide sweep of the term "agricultural products," and 
to show how such terminology influences those who disagree with us, the term 
"agricultural products" has been held to include swine, horses, meat cattle, 
sheep, manure, cordwood, hay, poultry, vegetables, fruit, eggs, milk, butter, 
and lard. (<em>See</em> Mayor <em>vs</em>. Davis, 6 W. &amp; S., 279.) <em>But 
never by any court to include fish</em>.</p>
<p>Like everything else in the world, it must be that there is a limit to the 
things which can be included in the term "agricultural products." The District 
of Columbia case, much relied upon by the plaintiff, gives the clue. Agriculture 
is but one pursuit. Agriculture and what it includes is contradistinguished from 
other occupations and professions, as manufacturing—and we believe, fishing. 
Thus, of fisheries the Encyclopedia Britannica (p. 429) says—</p>
<p>"For the most part the operations of fishing have been comparable with those 
of primitive hunting rather than with agriculture."</p>
<p>Fisheries, while possibly in concomitance with the soil, are even more 
certainly concerned with the water in which the fish live and have their being. 
If fishing is farming, then conversely farming must be fishing. Waiving all the 
technical definitions, does the ordinary man when he speaks of agriculture and 
farming think of a farmer as a fisherman, and when he speaks of fisheries does 
he think of a fisherman as a farmer?</p>
<p>One other word in the law, "grown" is necessarily included and must be 
considered in finding the proper meaning. The law provides that "agricultural 
products" must be "grown." Again referring to Webster, "grown" means "to cause 
to grow; to cultivate; to produce; as, to grow a crop; to grow wheat, hops, or 
tobacco." The fish taken from the fishponds and sold are certainly not the 
natural products of such land. They are retained therein by the construction of 
artificial dykes. They are animals <em>farae nature</em>. They have none of the 
characteristics of the natural products of the soil. Fish are not "grown" as 
wheat, hops, or tobacco are "grown."</p>
<p>The question as to whether or not a similar exemption in favor of 
agriculturists contained in the Internal Revenue Law of 1904 operated to exclude 
from the merchant's tax, receipts from the sale of fish, arose shortly after the 
passage of that Act. The Attorney-General in an opinion rendered on March 14, 
1906 (3 Op, Atty. Gen., 65), held in effect that the culture of the soil was the 
determining factor in considering what products are or are not agricultural 
products. As to quarrymen and fishermen, the Attorney-General observed—</p>
<p>"The occupation of the lumberman and the stockman, in the historical 
development of these industries, as well as in present day practice, has never 
been confused with that of the agriculturist; while as to quarrymen and 
fishermen it may be observed that <em>tillers of the soil are not wont to plow 
the fields</em> in quest of rock or <em>in anticipation of a crop of fishes or 
of pearls</em>."</p>
<p>This opinion of the Attorney-General was concurred in by the then 
Governor-General and Acting Secretary of Finance and Justice, who had helped 
draft the law. The Collector of Internal Revenue thereupon published the opinion 
in full in Bureau of Internal Revenue Circular, No. 106. This official ruling of 
the executive officials is now entitled to consideration by the courts. Courts 
will and should respect the contemporaneous construction placed upon a statute 
by the executive officers whose duty it is to enforce it, and unless such 
interpretation is clearly erroneous will ordinarily be controlled thereby. 
(<em>In re</em> Allen [1903], 2 Phil., 630, following Pennoyer <em>vs</em>. 
McConnaughy [1890], 140 U. S., 363; Government of Philippine Islands <em>Ex 
Rel</em>. Municipality of Cardona <em>vs</em>. Municipality of Binangonan 
[1916], 34 Phil. Rep., 518.)</p>
<p>We have thus far considered the etymology of the words. We frankly admit to a 
slight doubt of exact interpretation by ttys method. We, however, believe that 
viewed from the standpoint of the most elementary of all rules of statutory 
construction there is but one possible result. In other words, our sole duty is 
to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the lawmaking body. We can best 
discover this intention through the medium of the action taken by the 
Legislature in the enactment of other laws.</p>
<p>The first Internal Revenue Law (Act No. 1189) was enacted by the Philippine 
Commission. It is plain that the Commissioners must have had in mind agriculture 
as known to them in the United States. The organization of the American 
Government includes a "Department of Agriculture," the "Bureau of Fisheries" is 
under the Department of Commerce. Agriculture and Fishing are therefore separate 
and distinct. In Great Britain there is a "Board of Agriculture <em>and</em> 
Fisheries." Moreover, the same Philippine Legislature which provided an 
exemption from taxation for agricultural products was also interested in 
establishing a Bureau of Agriculture. In enumerating the functions of this 
Bureau, not one word is said of fish or fisheries. We rather doubt if the 
experts in agronomy In the Bureau of Agriculture would consider themselves 
competent to advise as to piscatology. On the contrary, you find a section of 
fisheries established not in the Bureau of Agriculture but in the Bureau of 
Science. Instead, also, you find special laws unrelated to agriculture dealing 
with the granting of fishery privileges. The purpose of the Legislature in 
exempting agricultural products from taxation under the Internal Revenue Law was 
to encourage farming and not fishing. This court has heretofore held, and we 
reiterate, that "where language is plain, subtle refinements which tinge words 
so as to give them the color of a particular judicial theory are not only 
unnecessary but decidedly harmful." (Yangco <em>vs</em>. Court of First Instance 
of Manila and Yangco [1915], 29 Phil., 183.) Chief Justice Marshall in the 
historic case of Gibbons <em>vs</em>. Ogden, ([1824], 9 Wheat., 1) said:</p>
<p>"As men, whose intentions require no concealment generally employ the words 
which most directly and aptly express the ideas they intend to convey, the 
enlightened patriots who framed our Constitution, and the people who adopted it 
must be understood to have employed words in their natural sense, and to have 
intended what they have said."</p>
<p>The answers to our question are—A person engaged in the sale of fish is a 
merchant. Fish are not an agricultural product. This merchant is not entitled to 
exemption under the Internal Revenue Law.</p>
<p>The further objection is made that the particular tax would constitute double 
taxation. It is sufficient to note in this respect that this court in Gil 
Hermanos <em>vs</em>. Hord ([1908] 10 Phil., 218) said:</p>
<p>"It is very apparent that the tax under discussion is not a tax upon 
property. It is rather a tax upon the occupation or industry in which a person 
is engaged."</p>
<p>The internal-revenue tax is also uniform for all of a class. In opposition to 
such a contention, it could be advanced if necessary that the burden is on 
plaintiff to establish that the surrender of the taxing power is manifested by 
words too plain to be mistaken. "When exemption is claimed, it must be shown 
indubitably to exist." (Farrington <em>vs</em>. Tennessee [1877], 95 U. S., 679, 
686.) "The presumption is always against any surrender of the taxing power." 
(Tennessee <em>vs</em>. Whitworth [1885], 117 U. S., 129, 136.)</p>
<p>We have permitted our discussion of the question raised by this appeal to 
proceed much farther than is really necessary for the decision of the case. If 
we have fallen into the mire of prolixity, it has been because we approached the 
subject with a desire to accede, if possible, to the request of the plaintiff. 
We are as much interested in upholding legislation which will assist in the 
commercial development of the Islands as any one. We cannot, however, step 
outside the settled and ordinary meaning of the law and by judicial legislation 
give to the law a meaning not intended. If redress is proper, under these 
circumstances, complainants must look to the Legislature and not to the 
courts.</p>
<p>The judgment of the lower court is reversed and the defendant is absolved of 
the complaint, with the costs of the first instance against the plaintiff, and 
without special finding as to costs of this instance. So ordered.</p>

<p align="center"><em><strong>DISSENTING OPINION</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>JOHNSON, J.</strong>, <em>dissenting</em>: </p>
<p>The only important question presented by this appeal is whether or not the 
products of a "vivero de peces" should be considered as an agricultural product 
and as such relieved from the internal-revenue tax in accordance with paragraph 
(c) of article 41 of Act No. 2339.</p>
<p>The Court of First Instance, in a very well-reasoned opinion, held that said 
products were exempt from the internal-revenue tax under said Act. This court, 
by a majority opinion, held that said products were not exempt from the payment 
of the internal-revenue tax and reversed the judgment of the lower court.</p>
<p>We think the majority opinion misses both the spirit and purposes of the law, 
and works a great injustice and a severe hardship upon thousands of the 
inhabitants of the Philippine Islands who are engaged in purely agricultural 
pursuits. Said decision places a great burden upon those who are least able to 
bear it. By reason of the very small profits of the agriculturist, earned by the 
hardest of labor, every intendment of the law should be, at least, liberally 
construed in his favor.</p>
<p>Paragraph (c) of section 41 of Act No. 2339 provides that the tax imposed 
under said law shall not be imposed upon "agricultural products <em>when 
sold</em> by the producer or <em>owner of the land where grown</em>, whether in 
their original state or not." Under the interpretation given in the majority 
opinion, the Collector of Internal Revenue may collect taxes upon every grain of 
rice produced by the farmers of the Philippine Islands, unless he sells the same 
"where grown." Such an interpretation, in our opinion, was never intended by the 
lawmaker.</p>
<p>The majority opinion has fallen into error, in our opinion, in not 
distinguishing a "pesqueria" from a "vivero de peces." No contention is made 
that the products of a "pesqueria," as that terms is generally used, should be 
relieved from the internal-revenue tax. Our contention is simply that the 
products of a "vivero de peces" should be relieved from the internal-revenue 
tax, upon the theory that they are as much of an agricultural product as any 
other product of the farm by reason of the method employed in producing them. 
The majority opinion admits [that] whether a particular product is or is not an 
agricultural product depends upon the methods used in producing it.</p>
<p>A "pesqueria," as distinguished from a "vivero de peces," may be defined as a 
<em>specie of trap</em> placed upon the farm in which fish are caught from time 
to time. While a "vivero de peces"' may be defined as a part of the farm set 
aside for the raising or production of fish, the same as is done in the 
production of corn, sugar cane, rice, bananas, coconuts, ducks, chickens, eggs, 
milk, butter, lard, hay, wood, cattle, horses, sheep, or any of the other great 
variety of products produced by the farmers in the Philippine Islands, the only 
difference being one of degree of care and labor necessary for production.</p>
<p>The error which the majority opinion has fallen into may be best illustrated 
by an example:</p>
<p>A is the owner of a farm. A portion of the same is dry land capable of 
producing sugar cane, or corn, or other varieties of farm products which can 
only be produced upon dry land. A portion of said farm, by virtue of its 
location with reference to water, sunlight, and air may be used for the 
production of abaca, bananas, or some of the various classes of fruits. Another 
portion of the farm is low land, upon which rice or certain classes of 
vegetables only can be produced profitably. Still another portion of the farm is 
swamp land, covered by water and incapable of being properly drained. Another 
portion of the farm is mountainous so that it cannot be cultivated at all. Upon 
the mountainous portion of said farm the owner raises cattle, sheep, goats, 
horses, hogs, chickens, turkeys, eggs, lard, butter, wool and hides. Another 
portion of the farm can most profitably be devoted to the production of 
<em>bacauan</em> which was held to be an agricultural product. (Mercado 
<em>vs</em>. Collector of Internal Revenue, 32 Phil. Rep., 271.) The swamp land 
of his farm is of such a character that it can not profitably be devoted to the 
production of rice or any of the cereals, and is too swampy upon which to raise 
cattle, sheep, horses, goats, etc. The farmer, therefore, utilizes that portion 
for the production of geese, ducks, and other domestic fowls, as well as for the 
production of eggs. There comes a time when the swamp land ceases to be 
profitable for the production of rice as well as for the production of said 
fowls and eggs. <em>All of said farm</em>, including the various classes of land 
as above described, <em>is taxed as agricultural land</em>; ajid it is a matter 
of common knowledge that the "vivero de peces" are taxed as agricultural land, 
and equally as high, if not higher, than other lands devoted to the production 
of rice, corn or sugar cane, etc.</p>
<p>A great demand may arise for fish in the country. The farmer, in order to 
reap the advantage of said demand, ceases to produce eggs, or ducks, or geese 
upon the swamp lands of his farm and turns the same into a "vivero de peces." 
He, thus, wisely utilizing the different portions of the farm for the production 
of all of the products which farmers generally produce, is greatly increasing 
the wealth of the State.</p>
<p>The majority opinion admits that domestic fowls— chickens, ducks, geese, 
turkeys—and eggs, butter, lard, milk, vegetables, fruit, etc., are agricultural 
products, but argues that nothing is, or may be considered, an agricultural 
product which does not result from a cultivation of the soil. To admit that 
eggs, butter, lard and milk are agricultural products, and to argue that nothing 
is an agricultural product which does not result from a cultivation of the soil, 
presents a consistency in argument and conclusion which we are unable to 
understand. <em>It is admitted</em> that the land for a "vivero de peces" <em>is 
specially prepared</em>. A certain cultivation and preparation is necessary for 
the creation of a "vivero de peces." It is difficult to understand what special 
preparation of the soil is necessary for the production of hen's eggs, butter, 
lard, milk, or cattle, or sheep or horses or hogs, or goats which makes those 
products agricultural products. It is a matter of common knowledge that land may 
be specially prepared for the production of rice this year and then changed into 
a "vivero de peces" next year and vice versa. Under what interpretation of the 
law and under what definition of agricultural products may we conclude that the 
year in which the same parcel of land produces rice produces an agricultural 
product while in the year it is producing fish is not also producing an 
agricultural product? Of course, as we stated above, a "vivero de peces" must 
not be confused with a "pesqueria" which is used as a trap for the purpose of 
catching fish. No contention is made that the products of the latter is in any 
sense an agricultural product any more than the product of a trap placed in the 
fields for the purpose of catching wild animals, which from time to time pass 
upon the land, is an agricultural product.</p>
<p>It is admitted in the majority opinion that the land for a "vivero de peces" 
must be specially prepared by first building dykes and cultivating the land 
preparatory to the planting of the fish. The only difference, therefore, between 
the preparation of a "vivero de peces" and the preparation of a rice paddy is 
one in extent of labor employed. In both cases the land is specially prepared 
for the particular purpose to which the farmer desires to devote it. Forgetting 
for a moment the stereotyped and the lexicographer's definition of agricultural 
products, and forgetting for a moment that there is no more difference, so far 
as the method of production is concerned, between the production of corn and the 
production of ducks and eggs, we will find ourselves driven to the conclusion 
that from the standpoint of method of production there is no difference between 
the production of fish in a "vivero de peces" and the production of ducks upon 
land which is recognized as agricultural lands. The majority opinion has fallen 
into error by trying to make a 15th century definition apply to 20th century 
conditions. The judgment of the lower court should be affirmed with 
costs.</p></div>
