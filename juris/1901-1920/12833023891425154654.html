				<BR><STRONG>MORELAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">We believe that the accused is guilty of frustrated murder.
<p>We are satisfied that there was an intent to kill in this case. A deadly 
weapon was used. The blow was directed toward a vital part of the body. The 
aggressor stated his purpose to kill, thought he had killed, and threw the body 
into the bushes. When he gave himself up he declared that he had killed the 
complainant.</p>
<p>There was <em>alevosia</em> to qualify the crime as murder if death had 
resulted. The accused rushed upon the girl suddenly and struck her from behind, 
in part at least, with a sharp bolo, producing a frightful gash in the lumbar 
region and slightly to the side eight and one-half inches long and two inches 
deep, severing all of the muscles and tissues of that part.</p>
<p>The motive of the crime was that the accused was incensed at the girl for the 
reason that she had theretofore charged him criminally before the local 
officials with having raped her and with being the cause of her pregnancy. He 
was her mother's <em>querido</em> and was living with her as such at the time 
the crime here charged was committed.</p>
<p>That the accused is guilty of some crime is not denied. The only question is 
the precise crime of which he should be convicted. It is contended, in the first 
place, that, if death had resulted, the crime would not have been murder but 
homicide, and in the second place, that is is attempted and not frustrated 
homicide.</p>
<p>As to the first contention, we are of the opinion that the crime committed 
would have been murder if the girl had been killed. It is qualified by the 
circumstance of <em>alevosia</em>, the accused making a sudden attack upon his 
victim from the rear, or partly from the rear, and dealing her a terrible blow 
in the back and side with his bolo. Such an attack necessitates the finding that 
it was made treacherously' and that being so the crime would have been qualified 
as murder if death had resulted.</p>
<p>As to the second contention, we are of the opinion that the crime was 
frustrated and not attempted murder. Article 3 of the Penal Code defines a 
frustrated felony as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A felony is frustrated when the offender performs all the acts of execution 
which should produce the felony as a consequence, but which, nevertheless, do 
not produce it by reason of causes independent of the will of the 
perpetrator."</p></blockquote>
<p>An attempted felony is defined thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There is an attempt when the offender commences the commission of the felony 
directly by overt acts, and does not perform all the acts of execution which 
constitute the felony be reason of some cause or accident other than his own 
voluntarily desistance."</p></blockquote>
<p>The crime cannot be attempted murder. This is clear from the fact that the 
defendant performed <em>all</em> of the acts which should have resulted in the 
consummated crime and <em>voluntarily</em> desisted from further acts. A crime 
cannot be held to be attempted unless the offender, after beginning the 
commission of the crime by overt acts, is prevented, against his will, by some 
outside cause from performing all of the acts which should produce the crime. In 
other words, to be an attempted crime the purpose of the offender must be 
thwarted by a foreign force or agency which intervenes and compels him to stop 
prior to the moment when he has performed all of the acts which should produce 
the crime as a consequence, which acts it is his intention to perform. If he has 
performed all of the acts which should result in the consummation of the crime 
and <em>voluntarily</em> desists from proceeding further, it can not be an 
attempt. The essential element which distinguishes attempted form frustrated 
felony is that, in the latter, there is no intervention of a foreign or 
extraneous cause or agency between the beginning of the commission of the crime 
and the moment when all of the acts have been performed which should result int 
he consummated crime; while in the former there is such intervention and the 
offender does not arrive at the point of performing <em>all</em> of the acts 
which should produce the crime. He is stopped short of that point by some cause 
apart from his voluntary desistance.</p>
<p>To put it in another way, in case of an 'attempt the offender never passes 
the subjective phase of he offense. He is interrupted and compelled to desist by 
the intervention of outside causes before the subjective phase is passed.</p>
<p>On the other had, in case of frustrated crimes the subjective phase is 
completely passed. Subjectively the crime is complete. Nothing interrupted the 
offender while he was passing through the subjective phase. The crime, however, 
is not consummated by reason of the intervention of causes independent of the 
will of the offender. He did all that was necessary to commit the crime. If the 
crime did not result as a consequence it was due to something beyond his 
control.</p>
<p>The subjective phase is that portion of the acts constituting the crime 
included between the act which <em>begins</em> the commission of the crime and 
the <em>last</em> act performed by the offender which, with the prior acts, 
should result in the consummated crime. From that time forward the phase is 
objective. It may also be said to be that period occupied by the acts of the 
offender over which he has controlâ€”that period between the point where he 
<em>begins</em> and the point where the point where he <em>voluntarily 
desists</em>. If <em>between these two points</em> the offender is stopped by 
reason of any cause outside of his own voluntary desistance, the subjective 
phase has not been passed and it is an attempt. If he is not so stopped but 
continues until he performs the last act, it is frustrated.</p>
<p>That the case before us is frustrated is clear.</p>
<p>The penalty should have been thirteen years of <em>cadena temporal</em> there 
being neither aggravating nor mitigating circumstance. As so modified, the 
judgment is affirmed with costs. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres</em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Carson</em> and <em>Trent, JJ</em>., concur in the result. </p></div>
