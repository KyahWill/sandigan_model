				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> Eleno Afable, a Filipino, for some time had been, and in the first days  of  October,  1901, was  the  town crier (<em>pregonero</em>) of the pueblo of Pola, in the Island of Mindoro.  The American  forces were then in possession  of Pola,  and he was performing such  duties as the commander of those forces, through the municipal president, imposed upon him.  In the early part of  October he left the pueblo to bring from his sementera two of his children and some rice.  He was captured by insurrectionary soldiers, and taken by them  to their camp in the mountain, six hours from the barrio of Casiligan.  There  were  in the camp  between 150 and 200 revolutionary soldiers. The officer  in command was Raymundo Oorcuera,  since deceased,  before whom Eleno Afable was  brought by his captors.   The officer  convened a council, of  which the defendants  Buenaventura Paola  and  Modesto  Ramos, both officials inferior  in rank to said Raymundo, formed a part.  The letter asked the opinion of the other officers as  to the acts of  the  accused  and the disposition  to be made of him.  The  investigation  resulted in an order from Raymundo  Corcuera that the  prisoner  be killed, because he was a spy of the Americans.</p>
<p> Six soldiers, under the command of the defendant Brigido Jimenez,  were told off to execute the sentence.  He was taken by the guard into the forest, about a thousand yards from the camp, and there decapitated by the defend- ant  Miguel Monton.   His body was brutally mutilated and buried at the place of execution.  The guard returned to the camp, and  Brigido Jimenez reported verbally to Raymundo Corcuera that his orders had been carried out. The defendant Victorio Pilar was  one of  these six men.</p>
<p> The  five defendants  were tried in the Court of First Instance of Mindoro  for  the murder of  Eleno  Afable. Buenaventura Paola,  Modesto Ramon, Brigido Jimenez, and  Miguel Monton  were convicted and sentenced  to death.  Victorio Pilar was convicted  and sentenced  to twelve years and one day  of <em>cadena temporal</em>.   The case as to the  first four has been brought here en consulta. Victorio Pilar did not appeal.  The Solicitor-General and the counsel for the accused have joined in a motion that the defendants be discharged  on the ground that they are included in the amnesty proclamation of July 4, 1902. Under the circumstances above narrated it is clear that the murder of Eleno Afable was a crime of a political character.  (United States vs.  Vicente Villamor, decided by this court,  August 29, 1902; United States vs. Carmona, decided by this court, August 19, 1902;  In re Castioni (1891) Q. B.,  149; <em>In re Ezeta</em>, 62 Fed. R., 972.)</p>
<p> At  the time in question the  defendants, Buenaventura Paola, Modesto Ramos, and Brigido Jimenez were participating against the United States in the insurrection then existing, and  the murder was committed pursuant to an order issued  by an officer engaged in  that  insurrection superior in rank to any of the  defendants.   Miguel Monton and Victorio Pilar both testified at the trial that they were  prisoners to  the  insurrectionists.  Pederico  Aguilar, one of the six, testified that they were all prisoners except Brigido Jimenez and Vicente Espinosa.  The latter, Vicente Espinosa, in his testimony stated that he too was a prisoner.  There is, however, direct testimony in the case that they were all insurrectionary soldiers.  This is shown also by circumstances.   A formation of all  in the camp was made,  from  which the six men  were selected. The six were  all armed with  bolos.  They were  over a thousand yards from the camp.  If five of the six were prisoners, their escape could easily have  been effected. We conclude that Miguel Monton and Victorio Pilar were participating  against the United States in  the insurrection, and that  all of the defendants, except the said Pilar, are included  within the said proclamation.</p>
<p> We have, however, no power to make any order in the case of Victorio Pilar, as there was no appeal as to him, and his case could not  come here in <em>consulta</em>.  (Act No. 194 of the  Commission.)</p>
<p> The defendants  Buenaventura Paola, Modesto Ramos, Miguel Monton,. and Brigido Jimenez are, therefore, declared to be entitled to the benefit of the proclamation, upon  filing in this court the oath  prescribed therein as a condition of the amnesty, and upon the  filing of such oath the cause will be returned to the court below with directions that the defendants  be discharged, with  costs <em>de oficio</em>.  So ordered.</p>
<p> <em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Cooper, Smith, Mapa,</em> and <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
