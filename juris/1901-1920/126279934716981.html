				G.R. No. 3045, September 08, 1906</h4>
				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE, VS. TIBURCIO ZABALA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>TRACEY, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The accused, dissatisfied with his inheritance and with a vague notion of forcing a readjustment of his relations with his brother, and while intoxicated, set fire to his own house, his exclusive property.  The fire consumed not only his residence but the adjoining one belonging to a relative, valued  at  40 pesos.  The neighbor's  house was  at the time vacant, but in his  own house there was himself and his son.</p>
<p>In  the opinion of the majority  of the  court he is.not criminally liable for the fire set to his  own house nor did he intend or foresee the burning of the  house of his neighbor; consequently  his act can  not  constitute the crime of arson.  It does, however,  fall  within the terms of article 568 of the Penal Code, punishing as reckless negligence <em>(imprudencia teneraria)</em> an  act  which  if actuated  by malice would have constituted a grave crime.</p>
<p>The sentence of  the court below  is reversed and the defendant, for the crime of criminal negligence  <em>(imprudencia teneraria)</em>,  is sentenced to  six  months imprisonment <em>(arresto mayor)</em>, the indemnification of 40  pesos to Mariano Tandoc, and, in case of failure to pay,  to the corresponding  subsidiary imprisonment, with  costs.   After the expiration of ten days let  judgment be entered in accordance herewith and ten days thereafter the record  be remanded to the  court  from whence it came  for proper action.  So  ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Carson,</em> and <em>Willard, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
