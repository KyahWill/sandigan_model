				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS.  BERNARDO MANALO ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>WILLARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The court below convicted the defendants Bernardo Manalo, Francisco Cruz Asuncion (<em>alias</em> Tisat), Sotero, Batle, and Valentin Colorado, who have appealed.</p>
<p>It appears that Bernardo Manalo and Francisco  Cruz Asuncion lived in  Manila,  Some written appointments of officials in a revolutionary army were, it is claimed, signed by these two appellants  and sent to the Province  of Zambales, where they were received by the other two appellants. Those appointments are  in the record and they purport to be signed by Francisco  Cruz Asuncion and also  by  Bernardo Manalo.</p>
<p>The only evidence in the case against Bernardo Manalo is testimony relating  to certain confessions made by the different defendants at a preliminary hearing or investigation before the provincial governor,  the provincial fiscal, and other persons.  The provincial governor testified that Manalo at this time denied all connection with the affair, declared that he never signed any of  these documents and never authorized anyone else to sign  them for him.   This is all the legal evidence there is in the case against him. Some of the other defendants in this preliminary examination made some statements  in regard to this appellant, Manalo, but there was no testimony  given by these other defendants during the trial in the Court of First Instance which in any way indicated the guilt of the latter; in fact, the only person who testified for any  of the defendants at the trial was the appellant Francisco  Cruz Asuncion, who denied all connection with the affair and swore that lie did not know Bernardo Manalo.   Under  these circumstances statements made  by persons other than Manalo  outside of the court and testified to  by third  persons are hearsay and not admissible against this appellant.  (U. S. <em>vs</em>. Caligagan, 2 Phil. Rep., 433.)</p>
<p>As to  the defendant Valentin Colorado, there is testimony that four of these  appointments  were found in a trunk in his house by one Jose" Millora.  We have already held that the mere possession of a document of this kind is not sufficient to convict.   (U. S.  <em>vs</em>. Antonio de los Reyes,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 2 Off. Gaz., 364; U. S. <em>vs</em>. Nu√±ez,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 3 Off. Gaz., 408.)</p>
<p>Moreover, there is evidence in the case that at the time these papers were received by the appellant, Valentin Colorado, he went  to one  of the assistant councilmen of the barrio in which he lived, a witness for the  Government, showed him the envelope, and stated  to him that  he had received these papers, that he did not know what they were, and requested this councilman to open them.  The councilman did not wish to do that, but took the envelope and sent  it to the councilman Jose Millora.  We are satisfied that this envelope  contained the appointments in question and that the appellant did not act under the appointment but immediately reported the receipt of them to the authorities.  There are among the papers sent to this court certain typewritten documents purporting to be examinations of  the defendants in this ease, but these papers were not offered in evidence during the trial  in the Court of First Instance and can not be considered as evidence against the appellants.  The evidence is not sufficient to support the judgment against Valentin Colorado.</p>
<p>As to Sotero Batle, it was proved that he, being a soldier in  the Constabulary stationed in Zambales, received from the appellant Francisco Cruz Asuncion a letter relating to this revolutionary organization.   This letter was found in  his trunk in the Constabulary quarters and with it a letter which was proved to be in his handwriting but not signed by his name nor addressed to any specific person. There is no evidence outside of this testimony that he took any action in connection with the matter.   We do not think that he can be convicted under the testimony offered in this case against him.</p>
<p>As to  the other appellant, Francisco Cruz Asuncion, it is proved jfchat this letter found  in the possession of  Batle was sent by him.  It bore his signature and, as we have said,  referred to this proposed uprising.   It also bore in various places thereon the impression of a seal indicating the military character of the organization.  We think the evidence is sufficient to support the conviction of this defendant.</p>
<p>The judgment of the court below, so far as it relates to Bernardo Manalo, Sotero Batle,  and Valentin Colorado, is reversed and they are acquitted,  with the costs of both instances as to them <em>de oficio</em>.  As to the appellant Francisco  Cruz  Asuncion, the judgment of the court below is affirmed, with  one-fourth of  the costs  of this instance against him.  At the expiration of ten days after rendering judgment the case will be remanded to the court  below for proper procedure.  So ordered.</p>
