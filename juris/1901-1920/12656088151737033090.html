<blockquote>
<p>"You are hereby summoned to appear before the Court of First Instance of the 
city of Manila, P. I., on the 18th day of December, 1912, at the hour of 8 a. 
m., to answer the charge made against you upon the information of F. H. Nesmith, 
assistant prosecuting attorney of the city of Manila, for libel, as set forth in 
the said information filed in this court on December 16, 1912, a copy of which 
is hereto attached and herewith served upon you.</p>
<p>"Dated at the city of Manila, P. L, this 17th day of December, 
1912.</p></blockquote>
<p align="right">(Sgd.) "GEO. N. HURD,</p>
<p align="right"><em>"Judge, Court of First Instance."</em></p>
<p>The information upon which said process was issued is as follows:</p>
<p align="center">[Heading omitted.]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The undersigned accuses the West Coast Life Insurance Company, John 
Northcott, and Manuel C. Grey of the crime of libel, committed as follows:</p>
<p>"That on or about the 14th day of September, 1912, and continuously 
thereafter up to and including the date of this complaint, in the city of 
Manila, P. L, the said defendant West Coast Life Insurance Company was and has 
been a foreign corporation duly organized in the State of California, United 
States of America, and registered and doing business in the Philippine Islands; 
that the said defendant John Northcott then and there was and has been the 
general agent and manager for the Philippine Islands of the said defendant 
corporation West Coast Life Insurance Company, and the said defendant Manuel C. 
Grey was and has been an agent and employee of the said defendant corporation 
West Coast Life Insurance Company, acting in the capacity of treasurer of the 
branch of the said defendant corporation in the Philippine Islands; that on or 
about the said 14th day of September, 1912, and for some time thereafter, to 
wit, during the months of September and October, 1912, in the city of Manila, P. 
L, the said defendants West Coast Life Insurance Company, John Northcott, and 
Manuel C. Grey, conspiring and confederating together, did then and there 
willfully, unlawfully, and maliciously, and to the damage of the Insular Life 
Insurance Company, a domestic corporation duly organized, registered, and doing 
business in the Philippine Islands, and with intent to cause such damage and to 
expose the said Insular Life Insurance Company to public hatred, contempt, and 
ridicule, compose and print, and cause to be printed a large number of 
circulars, and, in numerous printings in the form of said circulars, did publish 
and distribute, and cause to be published and distributed, among other persons, 
to policy holders and prospective policy holders of the said Insular Life 
Insurance Company, among other things, a malicious defamation and libel in the 
Spanish language, of the words and tenor following:<br><br>" 'First. For some 
time past various rumors are current to the effect that the Insular Life 
Insurance Company is not in as good a condition as it should be at the present 
time, and that really it is in bad shape. Nevertheless, the investigations made 
by the representative of the "Bulletin" have failed fully to confirm these 
rumors. It is known that the Insular Auditor has examined the books of the 
company and has found that its capital has diminished, and that by direction of 
the said official the company has decided to double the amount of its capital, 
and also to pay its reserve fund. All this is true.'<br><br>"That the said 
circulars, and the matters therein contained hereinbefore set forth in this 
information, tend to impeach and have impeached the honesty, virtue, and 
reputation of the said Insular Life Insurance Company by exposing it to public 
hatred, contempt, and ridicule; that by the matters printed in said circulars, 
and hereinbefore set forth in this information, the said defendants West Coast 
Life Insurance Company, John Northcott, and Manuel C. Grey meant and intended to 
state and represent to those to whom the said defendants delivered said 
circulars as aforesaid, that the said Insular Life Insurance Company was then 
and there in a dangerous financial condition and on the point of going into 
insolvency, to the detriment of the policy holders of the said Insular Life 
Insurance Company, and of those with whom the said Insular Life Insurance 
Company have and have had business transactions, and each and all of said 
persons to whom the said defendants delivered said circulars, and all persons as 
well who read said circulars understood the said matters in said circulars to 
have said libelous sense and meaning. Contrary to law."</p></blockquote>
<p>On the 20th day of December, 1912, the plaintiff, together with the other 
persons named as accused in said process, through their attorneys, served upon 
the prosecuting attorney and filed with the clerk of the court a motion to quash 
said summons and the service thereof, on the ground that the court had no 
jurisdiction over the said company, there being no authority in the court for 
the issuance of the process, Exhibit B, the order under which it was issued 
being void. The court denied the motion and directed plaintiff to appear before 
it on the 28th day of December, 1912, and to plead to the information, to which 
order the plaintiff then and there duly excepted.</p>
<p>It is alleged in the complaint that "unless restrained by this Court the 
respondent will proceed to carry out said void order and compel your petitioner 
to appear before his court and plead, and submit to criminal prosecution without 
having acquired any jurisdiction whatever over your petitioner."</p>
<p>The prayer of the complaint is, "your petitioner prays judgment for the, 
issuance of a writ of prohibition against the respondent, commanding the 
respondent absolutely to desist or refrain from further proceedings against your 
petitioner in the said criminal action,"</p>
<p>The basis of the action is that the Court of First Instance has no power or 
authority, under the laws of the Philippine Islands, to proceed against a 
corporation, as such, criminally, to bring it into court for the purpose of 
making it amenable to the criminal laws. It is contended that the court had no 
jurisdiction to issue the process in evidence against the plaintiff corporation; 
that the issuance and service thereof upon the plaintiff corporation were 
outside of the authority and jurisdiction of the court, were authorized by no 
law, conferred no jurisdiction over said corporation, and that theywere 
absolutely void and without force or effect.</p>
<p>The plaintiff, further attacking said process, alleges that the process is a 
mixture of civil and criminal process, that it is not properly signed, that it 
does not direct or require an arrest; that it is an order to appear and answer 
on a date certain without restraint of the person, and that it is not in the 
form required by law.</p>
<p>Section 5 of General Orders, No. 58, defines an information as "an accusation 
in writing charging a person with a public offense." Section 6 provides that a 
complaint or information is sufficient if it shows "the name of the defendant, 
or if his name cannot be discovered, that he is described under a fictitious 
name with a statement that his true name is unknown to the informant or official 
signing the same. His true name may be inserted at any stage of the proceedings 
instituted against him; whenever ascertained." These provisions, as well as 
those which relate to arraignment and counsel, and to demurrers and pleas, 
indicate clearly that the maker of the Code of Criminal Procedure had no 
intention or expectation that corporations would be included among those who 
would fall within the provisions thereof. The only process known to the Code of 
Criminal Procedure, or which any court is by that order authorized to issue, is 
an order of arrest. The Code of Criminal Procedure provides that "if the 
magistrate be satisfied from the investigation that the crime complained of has 
been committed, and there is reasonable ground to believe that the party charged 
has committed it, he must issue <em>an order for his arrest.</em> If the offense 
be bailable, and the defendant offer a sufficient security, he shall be admitted 
to bail; otherwise he shall be committed to prison." There is no authority for 
the issuance of any other process than an order of arrest. As a necessary 
consequence, the process issued in the case before us is without 
<em>express</em> authorization of statute.</p>
<p>The question remains as to whether or not the court may, of itself and on its 
own motion, create not only a process but a procedure by which the process may 
be made effective. </p>
<p>We do not believe that the authority of the courts of the Philippine Islands 
extends so far. While having the inherent powers which usually go with courts of 
general jurisdiction, we are of the opinion that, under the circumstances of 
their creation, they have only such authority in criminal matters as is 
expressly conferred upon them by statute or which it is necessary to imply from 
such authority in order to carry out fully and adequately the express authority 
conferred. We do not feel that Courts of First Instance have authority to create 
new procedure and new processes in criminal law. The exercise of such power 
verges too closely on legislation. Even though it be admitted, a question we do 
not now decide, that there are various penal laws in the Philippine Islands 
which corporations as such may violate, still we do not believe that the courts 
are authorized to go to the extent of creating special procedure and special 
processes for the purpose of carrying out those penal statutes, when the 
legislature itself has neglected to do so. To bring a corporation into court 
criminally requires many additions to the present criminal procedure. While it 
may be said to be the duty of courts to see to it that criminals are punished, 
it is no less their duty to follow prescribed forms of procedure and not to go 
out upon unauthorized ways or act in an unauthorized manner.</p>
<p>There are many cases cited by counsel for the defendant which show that 
corporations have been proceeded against criminally by indictment and otherwise 
and have been punished as malefactors by the courts. Of this, of course, there 
can be no doubt; but it is clear that, in those cases, the statute, by express 
words or by necessary intendment, included corporations within the persons who 
could offend against the criminal laws; and the legislature, at the same time 
established a procedure applicable to corporations. No case has been cited to us 
where a corporation has been proceeded against under a criminal statute where 
the court did not exercise its common law powers or where there was not in force 
a special procedure applicable to corporations.</p>
<p>The courts of the Philippine Islands are creatures of statute and, as we have 
said, have only those powers conferred upon them by statute and those which are 
required to exercise that authority fully and adequately. The courts here have 
no common law jurisdiction or powers. If they have any powers not conferred by 
statute, expressly or impliedly, they would naturally come from Spanish and not 
from common law sources. It is undoubted that, under the Spanish criminal law 
and procedure, a corporation could not have been proceeded against criminally, 
as such, if such an entity as a corporation in fact existed under the Spanish 
law, and as such it could not have committed a crime in which a willful purpose 
or a malicious intent was required. Criminal actions would have been restricted 
or limited, under that system, to the officials of such corporations and never 
would have been directed against the corporation itself. This was the rule with 
relation to associations or combinations of persons approaching, more or less, 
the corporation as it is now understood, and it would undoubtedly have been the 
rule with corporations. From this source, then, the courts derive no authority 
to bring corporations before them in criminal actions, nor to issue processes 
for that purpose.<br><br>The case was submitted to this Court on an agreed 
statement of facts with a stipulation for a decision upon the merits. We are of 
the opinion that the plaintiff is entitled, under that stipulation, to the 
remedy prayed for.</p>
<p>It is adjudged that the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila be and 
it is hereby enjoined and prohibited from proceeding further in the criminal 
cause which is before us in this proceeding, entitled United States vs. West 
Coast Life Insurance Company, a corporation, John Northcott and Manuel C. Grey, 
so far as said proceedings relate to the said West Coast Life Insurance Company, 
a corporation, the plaintiff in the case.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J.,</em> and <em>Araullo, J.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em>Carson, J.,</em> concurs in the result.</p>
<p><em>Prohibition granted.<br></em></p></div>
