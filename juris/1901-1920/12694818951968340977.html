				<H3>WISE & CO. (LTD.), PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. JAMES KELLY AND MARIANO LIM, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>FISHER, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This action was brought in the Court of First Instance of Manila against the 
appellee, Mariano Lim, and one James Kelly, the former as surety and the latter 
as principal, to recover the amount of a promissory note.
<p>The note upon which the action was brought is in the following terms:</p>
<p>"Be it known that we guarantee unto the firm of Wise &amp; Co. (Ltd.) the 
payment of the sum of thirteen thousand seven hundred and forty-nine pesos and 
nine centavos (P13,749.09) which James Kelly, a merchant, owes to the said firm 
of Wise &amp; Co. (Ltd.), for goods and merchandise received and purchased by 
Mr. Kelly, to be sold in his establishment, upon the condition that Mr. Kelly 
will pay over to the firm of Wise &amp; Co. (Ltd.) at the end of each month all 
sums which he may receive from the sale of said goods and merchandise, and that 
in the contrary event we, the sureties, undertake to pay to the firm of Wise 
&amp; Co. (Ltd.) such sums as Mr. James Kelly may fail to turn in as above 
stated.</p>
<p>"In witness whereof we have signed this instrument, Manila, P. I., December 
12, 1912.</p>
<p align="right">(Sgd.) "James Kelly.<br>(Sgd.) "Mariano Lim."</p>
<p>In his answer to the complaint the appellee, Mariano Lim, interposed, among 
others, the defense that the obligation was conditional as to him, and that the 
fact constituting the condition had not occurred.</p>
<p>The trial judge in his decision said, concerning the construction which in 
his opinion should be placed upon note in suit:</p>
<p>"It will be seen that the said document obliges Lim to respond for the 
payment to the firm of Wise &amp; Co. (Ltd.) of the sum of P13,749.09 which the 
principal obligor Kelly owes to it for goods and merchandise received and 
purchased prior thereto, to be sold in his establishment, to the extent that 
Kelly fails to comply with the condition of paying in at the end of each month 
all sums which he may collect from the sale of such goods and merchandise, it 
appearing that he has only undertaken to pay such sums as have been received 
from the sale of merchandise by the principal obligor which have not been paid 
in by the latter."</p>
<p>Upon the evidence submitted the court below held that plaintiff had not 
proven that the principal obligor Kelly had failed to turn over any money 
whatever received from the sale of the merchandise for which the note was given, 
and establishes the conclusion that Lim had therefore incurred no liability, and 
that plaintiff has no cause of action against him.</p>
<p>In accordance with this conclusion, judgment was rendered against the 
principal debtor Kelly for the full amount of "the note in suit, with interest, 
and the action was dismissed as to Lim. From this judgment plaintiff appealed 
and has assigned as error the conclusion of the trial court with regard to the 
conditional nature of the obligation assumed by Lim.</p>
<p>Upon an examination of the document in question it becomes evident that Lim, 
as surety, did not undertake absolutely to pay the sum of P13,749.09, in which 
the principal debtor admits himself to be indebted to the creditor firm. His 
agreement was limited to respond for the performance by Kelly of one of the 
accessory pacts of the contract evidenced by that document, namely, the 
undertaking to deliver to the plaintiff firm the total proceeds of the sales of 
the merchandise for the invoice value of which the promissory note was 
given.</p>
<p>It not having been stipulated that the merchandise was to be sold at a price 
not less than cost, it follows that even were Kelly to pay in the total amount 
derived from its sale, part of his obligation to the sellers might remain 
undischarged. He, unquestionably, is liable for the payment of the note whatever 
may be the price at which the merchandise might be sold; but this obligation is 
not extended to Lim. It having been determined by the court, in its findings, 
which we regard as fully supported by the evidence of record, that plaintiff has 
not proved that it has not in fact received all the money derived from the sale 
of the merchandise mentioned in the note, it follows that there is no evidence 
of the existence of the condition to which the obligation assumed by Lim was 
subordinated. In obligations subject to a suspensive condition the acquisitions 
of the right on the part of the creditor depends upon the occurrence of the 
event constituting the condition. (Civil Code, art. 1114.)</p>
<p>For the reason stated, we affirm the judgment appealed with the costs of this 
instance to the appellant. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson, Carson, Araullo, Street, Malcolm</em> 
and <em>Avance√±a, JJ.</em>, concur.</p></div>
