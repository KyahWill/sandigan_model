				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The evidence of record  in this case  fully  sustains the findings of the trial court and establishes the guilt of the accused  beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>We  find no error in the proceedings prejudicial to the rights of the accused.</p>
<p>The trial judge imposed the penalty  prescribed by law in  its minimum degree, because he was of opinion that the accused should be given the benefit of the provisions of article 11 of the Penal Code.  We  do not think that this is a proper case for the reduction of the penalty in accordance with the provisions of  this article.  There is nothing  in the nature of the crime of adultery of which the accused were convicted, nor in  the particular  circumstances of  this case, upon  which to base such a holding. The record not disclosing the  existence of extenuating or aggravating circumstances in the commission  of the crime, the penalty prescribed by  law  should have been imposed in the medium and not the minimum degree.</p>
<p>We  therefore reverse  so much of  the sentence as imposes upon the accused the penalty of two years and four months of <em>prision correctional</em>, and  instead  thereof we impose upon the accused the  penalty of three years six months  and  twenty-one  days  of  <em>prision  correccional</em>. Thus modified the sentence of the trial court is affirmed, with the costs of this instance  against the appellants, and it is so ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson, Willard,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ., </em>concur.<br>
