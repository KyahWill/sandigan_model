				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On the 7th day of March, 1902, plaintiffs took delivery from the custom-house in the city of Manila a case of shoes containing eighteen pairs.&nbsp; On the 24th day of December, 1902, plaintiffs&nbsp; filed in the Court of First Instance a complaint&nbsp; in which the firms of Castle Brothers, Wolf &amp; Sons, and&nbsp; Smith, Bell &amp; Co. were made defendants, and in which the plaintiffs alleged that a&nbsp; firm in New York City had shipped them a case containing sixty-nine pairs of&nbsp; shoes; that this&nbsp; case of shoes was&nbsp; delivered&nbsp; in the city&nbsp; of San Francisco, California, in good&nbsp; order, to&nbsp; a steamship line of which&nbsp; Castle Brothers,&nbsp; Wolf &amp; Sons&nbsp; were the&nbsp; Manila agents, and was&nbsp; transshipped in Hongkong in bad&nbsp; order and&nbsp; with&nbsp; a weight of 117 kilos to the steamer <i>Loonsang,</i> of which&nbsp; Smith, Bell &amp; Co, were the Manila agents; that the <i>Loonsang</i> arrived in Manila on December 26, 1901, and delivered the case of shoes, weighing only&nbsp; 70 kilos; that the case was&nbsp; dispatched by&nbsp; the&nbsp; custom-house&nbsp; on the&nbsp; 7th of March, 1902, lacking fifty-one&nbsp; pairs of shoes; that the said&nbsp; fifty-one pairs of shoes were worth $368.73&nbsp; United States&nbsp; currency.&nbsp; To this complaint both of the defendants demurred and the demurrer was sustained.&nbsp;&nbsp; The plaintiffs subsequently thereto, and on the 30th day of September, 1903, filed an amended complaint in&nbsp; which Smith, Bell&nbsp; &amp; Co.,&nbsp; as consignee of the steamer <i>Loonsang</i>, of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Indo-China&nbsp; Navigation Company, was made the sole defendant. The&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; demurred to&nbsp; this amended&nbsp; complaint and the demurrer was sustained.&nbsp; Thereupon, and&nbsp; on&nbsp; the 3d day&nbsp; of December, 1903, plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint, making this&nbsp; appellant the sole&nbsp; defendant, the title&nbsp; of the case&nbsp; being&nbsp; "Cordoba y&nbsp; Conde,&nbsp; plaintiffs, <i>vs.</i> the Indo-China&nbsp; Navigation&nbsp; Company, whose local agent&nbsp; is Smith, Bell &amp; Co., defendant."<br><br>The&nbsp; allegations in this amended complaint are essentially the same&nbsp; as those of the original and first amended complaints.&nbsp; On the&nbsp; 3d day of&nbsp; December,&nbsp; 1903,&nbsp; plaintiffs' counsel mailed&nbsp; a&nbsp; copy&nbsp; of this&nbsp; second amended complaint to Pillsbury &amp; Sutro, who&nbsp; had appeared&nbsp; as attorneys for&nbsp; Castle&nbsp; Brothers, Wolf &amp;&nbsp; Sons and Smith,&nbsp; Bell &amp; Co. in the earlier proceedings.&nbsp;&nbsp; The court was at once notified that these attorneys were not retained&nbsp; by the&nbsp; Indo-China Navigation Company and had no authority to accept service upon behalf of the&nbsp; said company.<br><br>No further proceedings were had in the cause until the 10th&nbsp; day of March, 1908, when&nbsp; a summons was issued, directed to the Indo-China Navigation Company,&nbsp; which summons was served upon the appellant on&nbsp; the following day.<br><br>Appellant duly appeared by counsel, and on the 1st day of April, 1908, filed its answer, consisting of a general denial and a plea of prescription.<br><br>After a hearing, at which certain evidence was presented by plaintiffs and none by defendants, judgment was&nbsp; rendered&nbsp; in accordance&nbsp; with the prayer&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; complaint. To this judgment the defendant&nbsp; excepted, and after&nbsp; the appropriate motion&nbsp; for a new trial&nbsp; presented a bill&nbsp; of exceptions and&nbsp; instituted this appeal.<br><br>We think this case must be reversed upon the facts.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was proven that the case&nbsp; of shoes when delivered by&nbsp; the customs authorities to the plaintiffs contained only eighteen pairs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Plaintiffs alleged that the&nbsp; case when shipped from New York contained sixty-nine pairs.&nbsp; The only evidence offered&nbsp; to prove that&nbsp; the case did, in fact, contain sixty- nine pairs of shoes&nbsp; when shipped is plaintiffs'&nbsp; Exhibit&nbsp; C, which&nbsp; is a mere <i>ex parte</i> affidavit, and which&nbsp; was not competent evidence against the defendant.&nbsp; The defendant had no&nbsp; opportunity to cross-examine the&nbsp; maker&nbsp; of&nbsp; this affidavit upon the question&nbsp; of the number of pairs of shoes contained in this case.<br><br>The plaintiffs further alleged that the&nbsp; case of shoes&nbsp; was delivered to the steamer <i>Loonsang</i> in Hongkong weighing 117 kilos.&nbsp; No competent evidence was presented in support of this&nbsp; allegation.&nbsp;&nbsp; The only evidence presented on&nbsp; this point&nbsp; was that of&nbsp; Loewenstein, whose&nbsp;&nbsp; information was confessedly&nbsp; based&nbsp; upon hearsay,&nbsp; and a&nbsp; letter&nbsp; signed&nbsp; by Loewenstein which was also confessedly based upon hearsay.<br><br>The only&nbsp; evidence in support of the allegation that the case of&nbsp; shoes&nbsp; weighed but 47 kilos when it was delivered to&nbsp; the customs authorities&nbsp; by the steamer&nbsp; <i>Loonsang </i> and that it then contained but eighteen pairs, and that fifty-one pairs had been stolen&nbsp; while the case&nbsp; was in transit from; Hongkong to&nbsp; Manila,&nbsp; is to&nbsp; be&nbsp; found&nbsp; in&nbsp; Exhibits&nbsp; A&nbsp; and E-E, which are certificates of customs officers.&nbsp; Our attention&nbsp; has not&nbsp; been called to&nbsp; any provision of law making such certificates&nbsp; competent&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; of the&nbsp; facts which they recite.&nbsp; Our attention has been called to the apparent alteration of&nbsp; these&nbsp; two&nbsp; certificates.&nbsp;&nbsp; Exhibit E-E&nbsp; contains&nbsp; the phrase&nbsp; "caused by robbery in transit."&nbsp; The words "in transit" have obviously been inserted by some hand other than&nbsp; that which wrote&nbsp; the rest of the certificate.&nbsp;&nbsp; In Exhibit A appears the phrase "evidently caused by&nbsp; robbery in transit."&nbsp; The words "evidently" and&nbsp; "in transit" have been inserted by some person other than the one who prepared this exhibit.&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp; evidence is not sufficient to support&nbsp; the conclusions of the trial court.</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY"> The judgment is, therefore, reversed, without any&nbsp; special ruling as to&nbsp; costs.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i> Arellano, C.&nbsp; J.,&nbsp; Mapa, Carson, </i>and <i>Moreland, JJ.</i>, concur.<br></div>
