				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Esteban Sergio was arrested  without a warrant  by the defendant, an officer in the Constabulary, for alleged violation of the act defining and punishing  brigandage.   He was kept in confinement by  the defendant  for four days and was then released by him.   Within a short time thereafter he paid to the defendant 150 pesos cash, and delivered to him a certain amount of cacao.   The defendant was prosecuted for  bribery,  and  having  been convicted,  was sentenced to two years eleven months and ten days7 imprisonment and to pay a fine of 540 pesos.  From this judgment he appealed.   Sergio  was  never brought before a justice of the peace by the defendant for prosecution.</p>
<p>The facts above stated are conclusively proved.  It is claimed by the appellant, however, that the money was not paid by virtue of any agreement or promise made between the parties prior to the release, but that it was a  present given to him by Sergio after such release,  and that the. case therefore is governed by article 386 of the Penal Code. The wife of  Sergio gave testimony  to this  effect, and something  was said  also by  Sergio himself to the same effect, but he also testified that before  he was  released he promised to pay the defendant 200 pesos, and it is proved beyond  question that before  he was released  he  gave to the defendant a receipt or paper, and that when the defendant was paid the first 100 pesos this paper was destroyed by the defendant.  We think the evidence is sufficient to show that Sergio was released from imprisonment by the defendant by  reason of the promise made by  him before the release to pay this money to the defendant.</p>
<p>The facts above set forth  show the  commission of  the crime of bribery.  (United States <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Eustaquio  Horca,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> No. 2676, March 31, 1906.)   The court below convicted the  defendant of bribery under the provisions of  article 381 of the Penal Code.  The  crime committed by the defendant is that defined by article 383 of that code.  (United States <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Pablo Valdehueza,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 3 Off. Gaz., 413.)</p>
<p>It is suggested by the Solicitor-General that the case falls within section 19 of Act No.  175.  We do not think, however,  that that section is applicable, for there is no proof that the arrest was made for the purpose of extorting this money from the complaining witness.</p>
<p>The judgment of the court below is  reversed, and the defendant is convicted of the  crime defined and punished in article 383 of the Penal Code, and is sentenced to four months and twenty days' imprisonment (<em>arresto mayor</em>), temporary special disqualification for eight years and one day, to pay the costs of both  instances, and to pay a fine of 540 pesos,  with the accessories  provided by  law,  and in case  of insolvency to suffer  subsidiary imprisonment as provided by law.  After  the expiration of  ten  days from the date of final judgment let the cause be remanded to the court of its origin for proper procedure. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Johnson,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ., </em>concur.</p>
