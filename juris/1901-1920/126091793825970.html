				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This  is an action by the plaintiff to recover of the defendant a certain parcel of  land composed of 4 hectares, more or less,  in the barrio of Matik-Matik, in the pueblo of Santa Barbara, in the  Province of Pangasinan.   The action was first brought in the court  of the justice of the peace of said pueblo.   The justice of  the peace decided that the plaintiff had a right to the possession of said parcel of land.  The defendant appealed to the Court of First Instance of said province; the Court  of First  Instance decided  also  that the plaintiff was entitled to the possession of said land. The defendant  appealed  to this court.  The action  was brought under the provisions of section 80 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions  and was brought within  the period of one year from the time the plaintiff alleges that he was  dispossessed of  said property.  There is some confusion in the testimony adduced during the trial  of  said cause in the Court of First Instance with reference to the identity of the parcel of land in question.   The plaintiff claims  that he had been dispossessed and forced out of the possession of said land by the defendant and that he, the plaintiff, was the owners of said land and had been in quiet and peaceable possession of  the same  for several years.</p>
<p>The evidence on the part of the  defendant  shows that she, the defendant, had, through her son, dispossessed the plaintiff of a certain tract of land, claiming that she  was the owner of said land and Had been in possession of it for many years theretofore.</p>
<p>Admitting that the plaintiff and defendant each in their respective allegations  and proof t have reference to  the same land,  there is a preponderance of evidence that the defendant did dispossess the plaintiff of said land, by force, in the manner alleged by the plaintiff.  The judgment of the inferior court is  therefore affirmed with costs to the defendant.</p>
<p>Of course this decision does not affect the right of the defendant to institute an action for the purpose of  establishing her title to said land and for the purpose of recovering possession of the same.  If as is claimed by defendant, the plaintiff was found in possession of said land unlawfully, it was  her duty to institute  an action  to recover possession of the same, instead of forcibly ejecting the said plaintiff from such possession.  It was her  duty to resort to the courts  for the purpose of obtaining peacefully  her rights to said land.   Under the conditions disclosed by the proof in said cause,  the defendant  was not justified in taking the law into her own hands  and forcibly ejecting the plaintiff, and after the expiration of twenty days judgment shall be entered in accordance herewith and the case remanded to the court below for execution.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Mapa, Carson,</em> and <em>Willard, JJ., </em>concur.<br>
