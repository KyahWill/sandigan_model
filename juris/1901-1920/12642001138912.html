				<H3>HENRY ATHOLL EDWARDS, PETITIONER, VS. H. B. MCCOY, RESPONDENT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>MORELAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is  a petition for a writ of  <em>habeas corpus</em>.   It  is based  upon the  illegal  detention of  the prisoner by the customs authorities  of the  Philippine  Islands under  an order of deportation.</p>
<p>The facts  in this  case are  conceded.  It appears that the petitioner, Henry Atholl  Edwards, is a British subject and is seeking entrance to  the Philippine  Islands at the port of  Manila.   He is the  issue  of the legal marriage of  a  Chinese woman of  the full  blood to a  Eurasian—that is,  a  person of mixed European and Asiatic  blood—with no  admixture of Chinese.   At the time of his  emigration he was a resident of the British concession of Amoy, China.   His father is and has always been a British subject, with no Chinese blood, and the paternal grandparents of the petitioner  were at one time  citizens of the United States born therein.  The father's name is Frank Hugh Edwards and  the mother's name is Lian Niu.  The petitioner was born in  the British concession in Amoy and resided there  at the time of  his emigration.  The board of special inquiry denied him the  right to enter on the ground that he was a person  of Chinese race and descent by reason of the fact that his mother was a Chinese woman of the full blood.</p>
<p>The attorney for the respondent objected to  the jurisdiction of this court, under the facts and  circumstances presented, to inquire  into the correctness  of the decision of the board of special inquiry.  This court  has already many times  held that the decision of the administrative officers upon  the question  of the right of  an alien to  enter the Philippine Islands  is final where  no  abuse of authority of any kind is shown.   (Ngo-Ti <em>vs.</em> Shuster, 7 Phil. Rep., 355; Juan Co <em> vs.</em> Rafferty,  14 Phil. Rep. 235;  U. S. <em>vs.</em> Ju Toy, 198 U. S., 253; Pearson <em>vs.</em> Williams, 202 U. S,, 281; Chin  Yow <em>vs.</em> U. S., 208  U. S., 8.)   It is urged that a  hearing  having been  given  the  alien by the board  of special inquiry, its  decision,   whether  for or against,  is not reviewable  by the  courts  in the absence  of abuse  of discretion.   This, generally speaking, is true, as is clearly stated  and fully held by the cases above  cited.  It is also urged  that no  abuse of authority  or discretion  by the board  in the case before us has been shown.</p>
<p>It is unquestioned that an alien seeking to enter United States  territory is entitled to a hearing before he is denied such entrance.   What is a hearing within the  meaning of the law?  Generally  speaking, it may be said  to  be an opportunity given to  the alien to  present his case; to adduce his evidence tending to establish  the rights which he  asserts.  But, in  reality,  it is  something more.  He is  not  only entitled  to  present his .evidence but he is also entitled to have it considered.   The object of a hearing is  as much to have evidence considered  as it  is to present it.  The right to adduce  evidence, without the corresponding duty on the part of the board  to consider it, is vain.  Such right is conspicuously futile  if the person or  persons to whom the evidence is presented  can thrust it aside without notice or consideration.   The body to which the law permits the presentation of  evidence is undoubtedly  designed by  that law  to  be a deliberative body.   Deliberation is its  chief function.  Withdraw that attribute and it becomes  an aggregation  of individuals, governed  by no evidence, ruled  by no  conditions, dedicated  to no purpose, bound by  no rights, and amenable to no law.  A  body  designed by law to be deliberative which declines  to deliberate  abdicates  its functions and its decisions are entitled  to no  more  consideration than if made with no hearing at all.   While the duty to deliberate  does not  impose the obligation to decide  right, it does imply a necessity which cannot be disregarded, namely, that of  having something  to support its decision.  While the decision  of such a body does not  have to  be right to be effective and final, it.must, nevertheless, have something upon which it is based; there must have been something  upon which. the deliberative function of  the board acted, A. verdict or  decision with absolutely  nothing  to support  it is  a nullity, at least  when  directly attacked, and a body which affirms such a decision does not exercise either deliberative discretion or authority.   The same may be said of a finding which is in plain and open contradiction of the conceded  and  admitted facts of the case.   If all the parties to the  controversy concede that  the  person seeking  admission is  not  a  Chinese person or a  person of Chinese descent but is an English  person of English descent  and that is  the  only evidence before  the  board, a decision that  such  a person is riot entitled to enter is an arbitrary and not a deliberative act, has nothing whatever to  support it, and while it  might fall within what is  called abuse  of discretion or  authority, it  is not  so much an abuse as it is  an entire absence of discretion  of any sort.   It is rather an abdication of functions  than  an abusive use of powers.  If a  board, stating the  facts upon which it proposes to rest  its decision, draws a  conclusion from those facts legally impossible from any point of view, the drawing  of  such  a conclusion is an arbitrary act, an abuse of discretion, and  wholly  without authority.  This means, really and in substance, that there was no hearing. Under such  circumstances this court has jurisdiction to review.</p>
<p>We are of the opinion, however, that this condition does not exist in this  case.   The facts in this case are conceded. The board has  presented them  as hereinabove  detailed as the basis of its decision.  Upon those facts the finding is  made  that the petitioner  herein is a Chinese  person, or a person  of  Chinese descent,  within the meaning of the laws of  Congress  prohibiting the entrance  of such person into the territory of the United States.   We are of the opinion that that  finding must stand.   The  phrase "Chinese person or person of Chinese descent,"  as used in  the Act of Congress,  is  very broad; and,  under the rules pertaining  to the finality of the decisions of the immigration authorities  on such  questions  as laid down  by the Federal courts, we do not feel that we are warranted in  disturbing the conclusions reached in this case.  The conclusion that the petitioner is a person of Chinese descent is not devoid  of  foundation.</p>
<p>We  have read with the interest and care  the ably expressed contention of counsel for petitioner that the quantity of  blood  which one has in his veins, if he is less than the  full  blood, has nothing to  do with the determination of  his race; that the  race to  which one belongs depends upon the race of the father and  that that of the mother has no influence  in that determination.  Counsel call our attention to the case of Ex parte Reynolds, Federal Cases, No. 11719,  which they  rely upon as decisive in the case before us.</p>
<p>We can not  bring ourselves to agree with this contention. Quite different rules of  law govern the question in  hand. The rules which the court applied in the case cited spring from different conditions  and  are  formed by principles different  from those which govern  the  case before  us. There the matter dealt with was the jurisdiction of courts over persons within the territory of the United States and subject  to  its  sovereignty.  Here  we  are concerned  with the immigration of aliens into the territory of the United States.  There  the question  was  one  of personal rights. Here it is  one   of international rights.  There  the  question was purely judicial.   Here it is executive and administrative.   The  principles and rules applicable in one case may be  applicable only in small part to the other.</p>
<p>The application for the writ is denied.</p>
<p><em> Arellano, C. J., Torres,</em> and  <em>Johnson, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em> Carson</em> and <em>Trent, JJ.,</em> concur as  to the dispositive part.<br>
