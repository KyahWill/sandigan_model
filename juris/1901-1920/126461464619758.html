				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Five members of the  Constabulary  and three members of the municipal police of the town of Santa Rosa, in Nueva Ecija, having set out to look for Jacinto de Jesus, named by  Antonio  Mendoza as one  of several men who had assaulted  his house,  located  the  said Jacinto in the vicinity of the town of Jaen, in the same province.  Sergt. Alejandro  de los Reyes,  of the  Constabulary, says that he found Jacinto de Jesus  tied to a  tree and in a  very bad condition,  as a result of a beating inflicted upon him by the three defendants, Salunday, of the  municipal police of Santa Rosa, and the Constabulary men, Candelaria and Carandang.  Three hours after he was untied Jacinto de Jesus died.  A physician certified that he was covered with bruises from head to foot.   The doctor stated that blows on the thorax probably caused the death.</p>
<p>The testimony for the prosecution is convincing, and is supported even by the statements of the accused themselves. According to Alejandro Reyes (but testifying as to what he had heard the accused say), it  appears that Jacinto de Jesus had tried to resist with one of the bolos which he was carrying, having made  the motion of putting his hand  to his belt  or sheath.  The witness  says, however, that the deceased was carrying  this bolo because he  was cutting cane, and that  the other bolo he had with him was a short une, about a  span  in  length.  Another member  of the Constabulary there present testifies that Jacinto de Jesus threw himself  into an  attitude of resistance, as though about  to draw  his bolo, but the same witness  affirms that Espiridion Salunday had ordered them to hang up Jacinto, and that after  he was suspended he confessed that he had been kidnaped by some malefactors.  So that  either because he attempted to resist or for the purpose of forcing him to make some statement, the accused Avere guilty  of the  ill treatment which caused the death  of Jacinto de Jesus.</p>
<p>The court below condemned Espiridion Salunday and Timoteo Candelaria,  as principals, to the death penalty, and Dionisio Carandang, as accessory, to fourteen years and nine months of <em>cadena temporal</em>. Dionisio Carandang was not a mere accessory.  He also illtreated Jacinto de Jesus, as appears from the testimony of several  witnesses.  Although  his participation was nothing more than that of having tied Jacinto de Jesus  to the tree, such participation in the act would  be that of a coprincipal.</p>
<p>In tying Jacinto to  a tree the three  defendants acted treacherously (<em>alevosamente</em>).  Whether it was to prevent him from  making  resistance, whether it was to torture him for the purpose of making him give information, or whether it  was for  the purpose of inflicting further punishment, the fact is that by this means  the defendants secured themselves against any risk which might have arisen from an attempt at self-defense on the part of the victim.  We are of opinion that they had no  intention to cause so great an evil as that which resulted, but this does not neutralize that, other qualifying circumstance of  the resulting death, because if there was no <em>aleviosa</em> for  the purpose of killing there1 was aleviosa for the purpose of ill-treating.  The means employed  were not made use of for the precise purpose of making certain the death of Jacinto de Jesus, but as a sate means of ill treating  him without risk to the persons who were doing so.  If by this means the ill  treatment was aggravated, it follows that it  is a qualifying circumstance  in the death which resulted.   It was not a condition of the purpose, but it was a condition of the criminal  act itself, in whatever sense this be taken.</p>
<p>What we can not consider is the circumstance of extreme cruelty.  The death of Jacinto de Jesus was not produced by any special, precise act done for the purpose of producing that result, as the violence and ill treatment, doubtless excessive, wen1 principally directed to  extorting a confession or to the repression  of an attempt at resistance, and it was  only  by  these acts  as a  whole that the homicide resulted. Therefore  in this case  there is no starting point which permits us to determine which were the evils necessarily included in the commission of the crime, and which were only the result  of a deliberate intent to increase the sufferings of the victim.   (Decision of the  supreme court of Spain of June 16, 1897.)</p>
<p>Dionisio Carandang did not  appeal from the judgment, by which he was condemned to  fourteen years  and nine months of <em>cadena temporal</em>, with the accessories of absolute temporary disqualification to the full extent, and to subjection  to the vigilance of the authorities during the period of the penalty and for an equal period after the expiration thereof, and to pay, jointly and severally with the two other accused, the sum of 1,000 Mexican pesos to the heirs of the deceased, with a third part  of the  costs.   This part of the judgment is final.</p>
<p>With respect to the other accused, Espiridion Salunday and Timoteo  Candelaria, this court applies as a mitigating circumstance the fact that they did not have, when inflicting this ill treatment, an intent to cause so great an evil as that which resultedâ€”that is,  the death  of  Jacinto  de Jesus.   This having  been committed with  <em>alevosia</em>  the <em>aleviosa</em> with which the  deceased  was  illtreated),  the killing must be classified as murder.   Notwithstanding the presence of <em>alevosia</em>, as the  aggravating circumstance of extreme cruelty did not  concur, the accused can not be condemned to death.</p>
<p>We therefore condemn Espiridion Salunday and Timoteo Candelaria  to seventeen years four months and one day of <em>cadena temporal</em>, with the accessories of absolute temporary disqualification in its full extent, and subjection to the vigilance of the authorities during  the period of the principal penalty and for an equal period thereafter, beginning from the time of the expiration thereof, and to pay, jointly and severally, to the heirs of the deceased the sum of 2,000 pesos, and to pay one-third part of the costs each, the judgment of the court below being reversed  in so far as it  may be in conflict herewith,  and being  otherwise confirmed.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Cooper, Willard, Mapa,</em> and <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
