				<H3>DARIO ELEIZEGUI ET AL.,PLAINTIFFS AND APPELLEES, VS. THE MANILA LAWN TENNIS CLUB, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>COOPER, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> The appellee has moved the court to dismiss the appeal taken against the judgment rendered  by the Court of First Instance of Manila,  upon  the ground that the Supreme Court is without jurisdiction in cases  tried by the Court of First  Instance in  the  exercise of  its jurisdiction over cases appealed  from justice courts.</p>
<p> Article 74 of the Code of Civil Procedure of 1901 provides that either of the parties to an action pending before a justice court  may appeal against a judgment of a justice of the peace to  a Court of First Instance, the appeal to be tried at  the next regular term of  the said court.   In accordance with the provisions of article 75 the effect of an appeal so taken is to vacate the judgment of the justice court, and  the case, when duly entered  in the  Court of First Instance, is tried <em>de novo</em> on the merits, in accordance with the  regular procedure of that court, as though it  had not been tried before and  had originally  been brought therein.  Article 143 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that upon the rendition of a final judgment by a Court of First Instance disposing of the action either of  the parties  shall be entitled to  perfect a bill  of exceptions for a review by the  Supreme Court of all rulings, orders, and judgments made  in the action to which the party has duly excepted at the time of making such ruling, order, or judgment.  No  limitation  whatever  has  been fixed with respect to the right of the  parties to  appeal against a judgment of a Court of First Instance, nor has any distinction been made as io  whether the  case was commenced in  the Court of First  Instance or whether it was brought before it by appeal from a justice court.   We hold that article 143 confers jurisdiction  upon the Supreme Court in all cases of final judgments rendered by the Court of First Instance, either in the exercise of its original jurisdiction or its  appellate jurisdiction. The  motion  to dismiss is therefore  overruled.  So ordered.</p>
<p> <em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Willard,</em> and <em>Ladd, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p> <em>Mapa J.,</em> did not sit in this case.</p>
