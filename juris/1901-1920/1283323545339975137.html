				<H3>ANGEL PALMA, PETITIONER, VS. THE JUDGE OP FIRST INSTANCE OF TAYABAS AND MAXIMO PALOMARES, RESPONDENTS.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MORELAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an action of mandamus against the Court of First Instance of the 
Province of Tayabas and Maximo Palomares to compel it to go forward with and 
hear an election contest.
<p>It appears that, at the elections held in June, 1916, in the Province of 
Tayabas several persons, including Angel Palma, the plaintiff, and. Maximo 
Palomares, the defendant, were candidates for the office of municipal president 
of Santa Cruz. The municipal board of canvassers duly declared Maximo Palomares 
elected to that office. Angel Palma then filed a contest against the election of 
Palomares. After the proceeding had been duly instituted a motion was made by 
the respondent Palomares to dismiss the proceedings on the ground that not all 
of the persons who received votes for the office contested had been notified of 
the contest as required by law. The court, on the hearing of the motion, held 
that the evidence before it did not show that Juan Pelaez and Felipe Murillo 
were thus notified and accordingly dismissed the contest.</p>
<p>The court held that where a party respondent did not appear in the contest it 
was the duty of the contestant, before proceeding with the contest, to prove 
service of notice upon him. Failing to do this the court held that the 
proceeding should be dismissed. No proof was offered by the contestant to show 
that Juan Pelaez had been notified as required by law, he simply stating that he 
had left the proof of service at his house. With respect to Felipe Murillo it 
was shown that he refused to sign a paper acknowledging receipt of a copy of the 
notice of protest; but no proof was offered to show that he had been notified as 
required by law. Upon this showing, or, rather, lack of showing, the court 
dismissed the proceedings.</p>
<p>We have already sustained a demurrer to the original complaint upon the 
ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. 
It was amended and a demurrer filed to the complaint as amended.</p>
<p>We do not believe that anything new is presented by the amended complaint. 
The same facts remain after the complaint was amended as appeared before. The 
additional allegations consist very largely of arguments and we find nothing 
which should change our former decision. We hold with the trial court that, 
where a party respondent in an election contest does not appear at or before the 
hearing of the contest, the contestant should, before the contest proceeds, 
submit to the court legal proof of the service of the notice of contest as 
required by law. Failing to do that it is the duty of the court to dismiss the 
proceeding.</p>
<p>The complaint is dismissed, with costs. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Torres, Carson, Trent</em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.</em>, concur.</p></div>
