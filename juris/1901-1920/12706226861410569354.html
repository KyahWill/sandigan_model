				<BR><STRONG>MORELAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">There is presented in this appeal simply a question of fact.&nbsp;&nbsp; A careful study of the evidence presented on the trial leads us&nbsp; to&nbsp; the conclusion that the judgment&nbsp; should be reversed.&nbsp;&nbsp; We&nbsp; are of the opinion&nbsp; that&nbsp; it is against the great preponderance of the evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp; That the <i>lorcha</i> containing the potatoes, the value of which is in controversy, was&nbsp; left&nbsp; for two days in the hot&nbsp; sun,&nbsp; tightly closed and without ventilation, was due entirely to the wrongful acts and to&nbsp; the gross&nbsp; carelessness of the employees of the&nbsp; defendant company, is conclusively established by the evidence. The&nbsp; captain of the&nbsp; ship from which the potatoes were being&nbsp; discharged,&nbsp; the first&nbsp; officer&nbsp; of&nbsp; the same, and the customs inspector who was stationed on board thereof during the discharge of its&nbsp; cargo, and&nbsp; other witnesses, demonstrate&nbsp; this&nbsp; fact&nbsp; beyond&nbsp; a&nbsp; reasonable doubt.&nbsp;&nbsp; That the potatoes,&nbsp; when&nbsp; discharged from the vessel into the <i>lorcha,</i> were in good condition,&nbsp; is demonstrated with equal&nbsp; conclusiveness.&nbsp; This is shown not only by the testimony of the witnesses above mentioned, but by all the circumstances of the case.&nbsp; In addition to the potatoes discharged into the <i> lorcha</i>, there had&nbsp; been discharged into numerous <i>cascos</i> several thousand&nbsp; crates of&nbsp; potatoes&nbsp; from the same ship and from&nbsp; the same hold at the&nbsp; same time.&nbsp; It has&nbsp; been shown&nbsp; by uncontradicted&nbsp; proof that all of&nbsp; the potatoes, except&nbsp; those&nbsp; found in the <i>lorcha</i>, were&nbsp; in good condition at&nbsp; the time of their discharge.&nbsp; Only those in&nbsp; the <i> lorcha,</i> after two days of exposure to the heat of the sun, in tightly closed compartments, without ventilation, were found to be rotted beyond use or value.&nbsp;&nbsp; From&nbsp; the evidence&nbsp; we&nbsp; are satisfied that the&nbsp; potatoes&nbsp; in&nbsp; question&nbsp; when&nbsp; discharged from the ship into the&nbsp; <i>lorcha </i>were in good condition.&nbsp; That such was the case is demonstrated from the evidence beyond cavil&nbsp; or question.&nbsp; The only witness who seriously questions that fact is the witness Villanueva, who was an employee of the plaintiff on board the vessel at the time the potatoes were discharged into&nbsp; the <i>lorcha</i>, and was shortly afterwards discharged by&nbsp; the plaintiff.&nbsp; He&nbsp; testified&nbsp; that when so discharged they&nbsp; were so badly rotted as to be without value.&nbsp; Yet we find that&nbsp; this same witness, when he made a written report to the plaintiff, his employer, as to the condition of the potatoes when discharged,&nbsp; therein stated concerning&nbsp; the&nbsp; condition of those potatoes that&nbsp; out of the 1,085&nbsp; crates&nbsp; so discharged into the <i>lorcha</i> only 54 crates were in bad condition and&nbsp; a few were damp.&nbsp;&nbsp; The condition&nbsp; of&nbsp; the potatoes&nbsp; thus described by the written report which he at the&nbsp; time made to his employer describes a condition usual with potatoes at that time of the year and about the same as that of the potatoes discharged into the <i> cascos.</i><br><br>It has been shown by the evidence that the worthless and rotted potatoes of this cargo constituted&nbsp; about 5 per cent of the whole.&nbsp;&nbsp; This seems from the evidence to be the usual loss sustained&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; transportation&nbsp; of&nbsp; potatoes at that season of the&nbsp; year.&nbsp; Gross negligence of the defendant in the handling&nbsp; and care&nbsp; of these potatoes being conclusively&nbsp;&nbsp; demonstrated by the proofs, he should pay to the plaintiff the value of those lost&nbsp; by such negligence.&nbsp; The value of the potatoes&nbsp; proved&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the trial&nbsp; was P3.75 a&nbsp; crate, amounting in all&nbsp; to P4,068.75.&nbsp; Deducting 5 per cent of this sum&nbsp; for the general loss on&nbsp; the whole&nbsp; cargo, there remains a balance of P3,865.31.<br><br>The&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; is&nbsp; reversed and a&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; is&nbsp; hereby given&nbsp; against the defendant and&nbsp; in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of P3,865.31, with&nbsp; costs of this appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i> Arellano,&nbsp; C. J.,&nbsp; Mapa, Carson,</i>&nbsp; and&nbsp; <i>Trent, JJ.</i>, concur.<br></div>
