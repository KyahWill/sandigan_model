<p align="center">"DECLARATION OF VENTURA MARIANO.</p>
<p align="right">"MARCH 21, 1903.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"I am a native of Pineda, of the township of Pasig, 25 years of age, and by occupation a stonebreaker. I was a member of the police of the town of Pasig until the month of November, 1902, when I joined Lieutenant Papa and his soldiers. I joined the Nationalist Party six months ago. The man who induced me to join the Nationalist
    Party was Mariano San Juan, one of the members of the committee in the barrio of Rosario in the township of Piedad. I was invited by the men to join them because they accused me of being a member of the secret police, and I being afraid, went with them. The man who spoke to me was Fernando Montalan, who was the agent of the men in the field. One Monday night in November of last year they came into Pasig, and while I was on guard at
    the barracks they took me away. I went with them and took also all the arms which there were in the barracksâ€” nine revolvers and four carbines. The ones who took me
  away were Lieutenant Papa, one Memo, and his brother Felix de la Cruz, Guillermo Garcia, Cornelio de la Cruz, and Juan Santa Ana. After I had been in the mountains two weeks I was appointed a captain by General San Miguel; and he put me in command of forty men armed with guns. We came together at a place called Pugat Babuy, there being 300 men altogether under the command of San Miguel, Faustino Guillermo, Apolonio Samson, Ciriaco Contreras, Vicente del Mundo, Lieutenant Papa, and myself, for the purpose of holding a meeting for the appointment of officers of the troops. The Constabulary came there and we fought with them. In this fight we killed a Constabulary man and captured five, from whom we took their arms and then released them. They killed three of our soldiers.</p>
