				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The plaintiff appeals from a judgment upon the merits in favor of the 
defendants, and insists that the court erred:
<blockquote>
<p>"1. In holding that the interpretation placed upon article 30 of the bank's 
charter by the decision of the Supreme Court herein is not the law of the 
case.</p>
<p>"2. In holding that the defendants had a right to deduct their compensation 
from the gross profits of the bank.</p>
<p>"3. In holding that it was proper for defendants to compute their 
compensation upon the gross profits before charging against such gross profits 
the aggregate amount of accounts written off as uncollectible (dudosa y fallida) 
as shown in Exhibits C-l to C-9, inclusive.</p>
<p>"4. In holding that any of the debit items appearing in Exhibits C-1 to C-9 
and especially the industrial and internal revenue taxes, are items that should 
be charged against capital and not against current profits.</p>
<p>"5. In holding that it was within the power of the stockholders of the bank 
to ratify the so-called interpretation by defendants of said article 
30."</p></blockquote>
<p>This action was commenced by the plaintiff as a shareholder of the Banco 
Espanol-Filipino for the benefit of the bank and all of the stockholders 
thereof. Its purpose is to require the defendants as former directors and 
councilors of the bank to refund a portion of the compensation paid to them for 
their services, on the ground that the amounts thereof have been wrongfully 
computed.</p>
<p>The complaint contains three separate causes of action, of which the first 
only is here involved. The defendants demurrer to this cause of action was 
sustained upon the ground that the facts alleged therein were not sufficient to 
entitle the plaintiff to the relief sought. Upon appeal this judgment was 
reversed and the record returned for further proceedings. (19 Phil. Rep., 82.) 
The complaint was not thereafter amended.</p>
<p>The question raised by the plaintiff in his first assignment of error 
requires an examination of the pertinent allegations in the first cause of 
action. These allegations are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"X. That, notwithstanding the fact that article 30 of the said by-laws 
(Exhibit B) clearly and unequivocally prescribes that the net profits of the 
said bank shall be apportioned as follows: Ten per cent for the board of 
directors, five percent for the board of managers (composed of counselors and 
trustees) in compensation for their services as such, and the remainder, 
eighty-five per cent, <em>integrally</em> for the shareholders of the said bank, 
the defendants, as such members of the, said boards of directors and managers, 
respectively, did, during each and all of the years specified, fraudulently and 
to the great detriment of the said Bank and its shareholders, and without the 
knowledge, consent or acquiescence of the latter, appropriate to themselves for 
their own use from the profits of the said Bank sums of money reaching an 
approximate amount of twenty thousand pesos, or a total sum of one hundred 
thousand pesos during the five years aforementioned, by deducting their said ten 
and five per cent, respectively, from the gross profits instead of deducting 
them from the net profits of the said bank.</p>
<p>"XI. That the said defendants, during the time mentioned, carefully concealed 
in all the balances and reports of the said Bank published by them every 
indication that might give the stockholders of the said Bank the slightest 
suspicion that the said defendants were fraudulently appropriating to themselves 
the funds of the same; and that the plaintiff learned of such appropriation, by 
a mere chance, in the month of November, 1907."</p></blockquote>
<p>The Banco Espanol-Filipino was a banking corporation which, until January 
1,1908, was controlled by the by-laws Arid regulations annexed to the complaint 
as Exhibits A and B. On November 13, 1903, the plaintiff acquired 10 shares of 
the capital stock and has been the registered holder of these shares since that 
date. The defendants filled, during the time mentioned in the complaint, the 
offices of director, <em>consiliario</em>, and <em>sindico</em>, and 
collectively constituted the board of government. The only compensation to which 
the defendants were entitled for their services is that prescribed by article 30 
of the by-laws then in force.</p>
<p>This article reads: "Of the profits or gains which may result from the bank's 
operations, after deducting all the expenses of its administration and the part, 
if any, which corresponds to the legal reserve fund, there shall be set apart 
ten per cent for the directorate and five per cent for the board of government, 
the distribution of which shall be made as provided in the regulations. The 
eighty-five per cent remaining shall belong integrally to the shareholders pro 
rata the number of shares owned by each."</p>
<p>Since the date on which the plaintiff acquired his shares, the earnings of 
each half-year of the bank have been liquidated in the manner set forth in the 
Exhibits C-1 to C-9, inclusive, attached to the agreed statement of facts, and 
the respective defendants have individually collected for their services the 
sums specified in Exhibit D.</p>
<p>Under date of November 15, 1907, the plaintiff addressed to the defendants a 
letter alleging that the earnings of the bank had not been apportioned in 
accordance with the provisions of article 30, <em>supra</em>, and making demand 
upon them for the refund to the bank of a portion of the amounts received by 
them in compensation for their services. The defendants refused to comply with 
this demand and on December 7, 1907, the plaintiff commenced an action seeking 
the same relief herein prayed for. This action was dis missed, and on December 
21, 1907, the shareholders of the bank were convened in a special meeting "for 
the express purpose of discussing and taking action relative to the alleged 
interpretation of article 30 of the by-laws." At this shareholders' meeting 
there were present, either in person or by proxy, 183 persons and entities, 
holding 6,499 shares of the total issue of 7,500. Among those present at this 
meeting was plaintiff's attorney. The plaintiff's letter, referred to above, was 
read, as was the complaint which the plaintiff had previously filed, and, after 
a discussion in which the appellant's attorney took part, a resolution was 
adopted ratifying and approving the distribution of the bank's earnings as made, 
and authorizing the defendants to proceed in the same manner with the earnings 
of the latter half of the year 1907. In favor of this resolution there was a 
total of 555 votes, representing 5,550 shares. Soon thereafter the present 
action was commenced.</p>
<p>As will be seen from the plaintiff's first assignment of error and the 
argument of counsel relating thereto, it is strongly urged that inquiry 
respecting the interpretation and application of article 30, <em>supra</em>, has 
been closed by the decision of this court rendered upon the demurrer of the 
defendants to the complaint. Under the doctrine of <em>stare decisis</em> the 
plaintiff insists that "the law of the case" has been established and that it 
has been necessarily decided that the remuneration received by tne defendants 
for their services was not in accordance with article 30.</p>
<p>The decision relied upon by the plaintiff is that of Pascual <em>vs.</em> Del 
Saz Orozco (19 Phil.Rep.,82). "The law of the case," established by that 
decision, is the law of the case which was before the court and which the court 
thereby decided.</p>
<p>The plaintiff, as will be seen from paragraphs 10 and 11, above quoted, whose 
sufficiency was then and there under consideration, alleged that the defendants, 
in violation of article 30, had<em> fraudulently misappropriated</em> to 
themselves certain funds of the bank by computing their percentages upon the 
gross earnings of the bank and, by a series of fraudulent concealments, had 
witheld the knowledge thereof from the shareholders. The demurrer admitted the 
facts as alleged and raised the question of the right of the plaintiff to 
recover upon those facts. The ruling of the lower court was to the effect that, 
even assuming the facts to be as alleged in the complaint, the plaintiff had no 
right of action. On appeal the Supreme Court considered this very question and 
necessarily none other, which relates to the point now under consideration, and, 
in reversing the ruling of the lower court, decided that, assuming the facts to 
be as alleged in the complaint, the plaintiff did have a cause of action. If 
these were the facts oÂ£ the case now under consideration, there would be neither 
occasion nor opportunity to further discuss the law applicable thereto. But the 
case which the present appeal presents is not that case at all. Since that 
decision was rendered the case has been tried and the facts now before the court 
for consideration are not the allegations that the defendants fraudulently 
misappropriated to themselves certain funds of the bank, and by a series of 
concealments withheld the knowledge thereof from the shareholders, but the real 
facts as they have been stipulated in the agreed statement. These facts are that 
the defendants did not, as alleged, fraudulently misappropriate certain funds of 
the bank by computing their percentages upon the gross earnings, but did first 
deduct the expenses of administration, and that none of the acts of the 
defendants were tainted in any way with fraud.</p>
<p>In this particular the case now under consideration is clearly differentiated 
and distinguished from the former case. In that case the court decided that the 
defendants may not fraudulently compute their percentages upon the gross 
earnings, and that a complaint which alleges that they have done so states a 
cause of action. This was the question submitted and decided. The question 
submitted upon the present appeal is whether the computation really made is in 
accordance with article 30. This holding is not in conflict with the rule 
announced in the cases cited and relied upon by counsel for the plaintiff.</p>
<p>For example, in the case of Heidt <em>vs.</em> Minor (113 Cal, 385), the 
court said: "Moreover, the rule of the law of the case only applies when, on a 
subsequent trial, the issues and the facts found remain substantially the 
same."</p>
<p>In the case of Forgerson et al. <em>vs.</em> Smith (104 Ind., 246), the court 
laid down this rule: "But where the questions are necessarily involved, * * * 
the judgment on appeal rules the case throughout all its subsequent stages. The 
decision is an adjudication concluding the courts and the parties. It is not, of 
course, conclusive as to other cases, but it is conclusive as to the questions 
in judgment in the case in which it was rendered, upon the parties and those in 
privity with them. * * * We regard, the former decision as adjudicating all of 
the controlling questions in the case, for it was not possible to reach the 
conclusion there announced without deciding that the property in the promissory 
notes in controversy was in the administrator of the estate of Mahala Shaw 
deceased."</p>
<p>In Standard Sewing Machine Co. <em>vs.</em> Leslie (118 Fed., 557), the court 
used this language: "It is a familiar and entirely righteous rule that a court 
of review is precluded from agitating the questions that were made, considered, 
and 'decided on previous reviews. The former decision furnishes 'the law of the 
case' not only to the tribunal to which the cause is remanded, but to the 
appellate tribunal itself on a subsequent writ or appeal."</p>
<p>Now, has the remuneration of the defendants for their services been computed 
in accordance with article 30 of the by-laws?</p>
<p>The item of "profit and loss" for each half year, during the entire period 
covered by the complaint, was made up by crediting to it all the items of net 
profits produced by the various accounts of the bank, including the accounts of 
current debtors, the profits from exchange, the profits in the sale of money, 
the profits from the discount of bills and notes, the net proceeds from the real 
properties of the bank after the payment of all the expenses thereof, including 
taxes, insurance, and repairs, and all other net profits obtained by the bank. 
To the debit of this "profit and loss" account were entered all sums paid out by 
the bank as interest upon fixed deposits or credit balances of current accounts. 
The item of "general expenses" included salaries, light, water, stationery, 
stamps, attorneys' fees, and all other .items of general expenses incurred 
either by the main office in Manila or by the branch office in Iloilo. In short, 
it appears that every expenditure of whatever nature made from the funds of the 
bank, with the exception of the industrial tax (later internal-revenue tax) and 
amounts set off against bad accounts, was included in the item of "general 
expenses," or, what amounted to the same thing, deducted from the "profit and 
loss" account before computing the remuneration received by the respective 
defendants for their services. Upon this point it might be well to set out in 
full Exhibit C-1. (Exhibits C-2 to C-9, inclusive, were made up in the same 
manner.) This exhibit is as follows:</p>

<p>To this method of computing the defendants' remuneration the objection of the 
plaintiff is twofold:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(<em>a</em>) That before computing the defendants' remuneration there was 
not first deducted from the earnings or gains the amount payable as industrial 
tax (later internal revenue), and</p>
<p>"(<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) That before computing the defendants' remuneration there was not first 
deducted from the earnings or gains the amount retained to cover bad 
accounts."</p></blockquote>
<p>From an examination of article 30 it will be seen that only two items from 
the gross profits of the bank are to be deducted before computing the 
compensation of the directors and board of government (the defendants 
constituted both the directors and the board of government), to wit: Expenses of 
administration and the amount, if any, corresponding to the legal reserve fund. 
On December 31, 1903, the legal reserve fund of P225,000 was not only completed, 
but a voluntary reserve fund of P665,000, authorized by the charter, had 
accumulated. From the various Exhibits, C-1 to C-9, inclusive, it is apparent 
that nothing whatever was applied to this legal reserve fund, and, as the 
correctness of these exhibits is not disputed, it is also apparent that nothing 
was due this fund at any time during the period covered by the complaint. 
Unless, therefore, the items of industrial tax (later internal-revenue tax) and 
the amounts set aside to cover bad debts may be deemed "expenses of 
administration," it is clear that there is no merit in the plaintiff's 
contention.</p>
<p>At the outset it may be said that the proper disposition of this case is 
rendered difficult by the inaccurate language used in article 30. This article 
provides for a percentage of the profits (utilidades y ganancias), and it may be 
at once said that these are not necessarily <em>net</em> profits, as claimed by 
counsel for the plaintiff. Profits may be either gross profits or net profits, 
and there are innumerable methods of computing each of these. Likewise, 
"expenses of administration" may or may not include all amounts expended in the 
conduct of business. Indeed, it is somewhat unusual that a provision of the 
bank's charter, so difficult of exact definition, should be so lacking in 
precision. Hardly less unusual, from an American point of view, is the 
incorporation into the bank's charter of the measure of remuneration of the 
board of government. This, in America, has generally been considered a detail in 
the internal management of a corporation to be controlled by the shareholders 
themselves, Who, in many instances, even delegate to the directors the power of 
fixing their own salaries.</p>
<p>The remuneration received by the defendants is not even alleged to be 
excessive. The two active managers of the bank received, during the period in 
question, sums amounting to approximately P15,000 per year, while the other 
defendants, not participating in the active management of the corporation, 
received sums amounting in no instance to a salary of P2,500 per year. All of 
the defendants received, during the four and a half years, P201,825.81, or an 
approximate yearly average of P45,000 per year. Bearing in mind the magnitude of 
the business and the fact that the bank prospered under the management of the 
defendants, there is no wonder that no claim is made of excessive compensation. 
During all these years the plaintiff, as well as the other shareholders of the 
bank, remained silent, apparently content with the increased prosperity of the 
business, although at the end of each fiscal year they had the opportunity to 
examine the books of the bank and inform themselves of the method by which the 
defendants computed their compensation. And, furthermore, an extraordinary 
meeting of the shareholders was duly convened on December 21,1907, for the 
express purpose, as we have indicated, of discussing the interpretation placed 
upon article 30 by the defendants.</p>
<p>The industrial tax, which the appellant insists should be first deducted from 
the earnings before computing the percentages, was fixed by law at 5 per cent of 
the dividends distributed among the shareholders of the bank. In order to make 
the deduction of this tax, its amount must first be a known quantity. Since its 
amount is a percentage of the dividends, the amount of the latter must likewise 
be a known quantity before the operation can be made. The amount available as 
dividends is dependent upon the amount due and payable out of the profits to the 
defendants for their services. Therefore, this amount due the defendants from 
the profits must be known before the amount remaining for dividends can be 
fixed. For example, if the remaining earnings, after deducting from the gross 
earnings the general expenses, is the sum of P58,000, how much is to be deducted 
therefrom as internal-revenue tax before computing the percentage of the 
defendants? The law said that the amount of this tax should be 5 per cent of the 
dividends distributed. The amount to be distributed depends upon how much may be 
left after the remuneration of the defendants is paid. It is no reply to this 
argument to point out that the total profits may be or are usually sufficiently 
great to permit a declaration of the maximum dividend of P60,000 and that in 
such cases it is a simple matter to compute 5 per cent of P60,000, for the rule 
of computation, established by article 30, is a general one, applicable alike in 
all cases, whether the earnings of the bank be great or1 small. This article 
does not establish two rules of computations, one which is only feasible or 
practicable when the earnings are sufficiently large to warrant a dividend in 
the maximum amount and another and different rule when the dividend falls below 
that amount.</p>
<p>Again, in our opinion the nature of the old industrial tax negatives the idea 
that it is one of the items of "expenses of administration" referred to in 
article 30. This tax was levied by law, not upon the earnings or profits of the 
bank, but only upon such earnings or profits as were actually distributed among 
the shareholders as dividends. It was purely a dividend tax, collected for 
convenience in a lump sum from the company, but levied solely and exclusively 
upon the distributed dividends. To deduct this tax from the amount upon which 
the remuneration of the defendants was computed would have made the defendants 
contributors to the tax levied upon the company-shareholders. Article 30 does 
not require the defendants as employees of the bank to contribute to the payment 
of the bank's taxes. The discrimination made by article 30 between "expenses of 
administration" and other disbursements is reasonable and in accordance with the 
principles of the contract which existed between the bank and the defendants. 
That was a contract of employment in which one of the contracting parties agreed 
to supply the capital and the other his services, and to divide in a stipulated 
proportion the proceeds of the application of the services of the one to the 
capital of the other. Since it was incumbent upon the bank to furnish the 
capital, so it was incumbent upon it to maintain the same. Any tax which tended 
directly to impair the amount of the capital should consequently have been paid 
by the hirer of the services and not by the servant. There could be no real 
difference in principle between the failure to furnish the capital in the first 
place and the failure to replace any part of it which disappears by reason of a 
tax levied thereon. We, therefore, conclude that the method employed by the 
defendants for the liquidation of the bank's business, in so far as the 
industrial tax (internal-revenue tax) is concerned, was strictly in accordance 
with article 30 of the by-laws.</p>
<p align="center">DEDUCTION OF AMOUNTS TO COVER BAD ACCOUNTS.</p>
<p>When the defendant Orozco took over the management of the bank, he reported 
to the board of directors its financial situation, embracing among other things 
a loss from bad accounts for the past of over P500,000. It probably would have 
been possible to cover this entire amount of losses from funds in the reserve, 
existing for just such purposes, but to have done so would have left the bank 
without a present reserve. It was decided to preserve the reserve fund intact, 
and carry the bad accounts as accounts in suspense until the same could be 
gradually and conveniently wiped out. Consequently, in each half yearly 
liquidation the dividends distributed to the shareholders were strictly limited 
to 4 per cent per semester, and the earnings after payment of the expenses of 
administration, the remuneration of defendants, the taxes, and the said 
dividends were applied pro tanto to the extinction of the bad accounts held in 
suspense. It does not clearly appear whether these funds, which were used for 
that purpose, first went into the voluntary reserve fund and were then applied 
to the extinction of the bad accounts in suspense or were applied directly by 
the semiannual liquidations from the profit and loss accounts. The process 
followed is immaterial since the result must be the same. The important fact is 
that in each semester there was an excess of net profits over and above the 4 
per cent provided in article 31 of the by laws. This excess of net profits was 
divisible under that article, one-half to the shareholders and one-half to the 
legal reserve, voluntary reserve, or additional dividends as the case might be. 
Instead, the entire excess of net profits went to extinguish bad accounts whose 
extinction would have exhausted the reserve fund and required its replenishment. 
To the extent that one-half of the excess of net profits were not distributed as 
dividends, but were put to the purposes of reserve, the shareholders made a 
sacrifice for their own welfare. Whether this was valicjly done or not is of no 
importance at this time for the reason that the remuneration of the defendants 
was not affected in any way thereby. As to the remaining half of the excess net 
profits, the application made was in direct accord with the by-laws, since the 
application of the funds to the purposes of the .reserve fund is exactly the 
same as if the reserve fund had been employed for the purpose and then 
replenished by these funds.</p>
<p>According to article 30, the net profits belonged to the shareholders. 
According to article 31, these net profits, belonging to the shareholders, 
should be partially divided among them and partially kept intact in the bank, 
according to the amount thereof, to the status of the legal reserve, and to the 
wishes of the board of government respecting a voluntary reserve. From the fact 
that part of the net profits was preserved intact in the bank as part of either 
the legal or voluntary reserve, it cannot be said that such portion of the net 
profits had ceased to belong to the share holders. These excess net profits are, 
in a sense, still in the bank and still belong to the shareholders within the 
meaning of article 30. To hold that the bad accounts of the bank should have 
been extinguished by the gross earnings instead of the net profits, would, in 
effect, compel the defendants, as employees, to contribute to the replenishing 
of the depleted reserves of the bank.</p>
<p>It would be wholly unjust to include under "expenses of administration" 
during the time the defendants were in charge, the losses previously sustained 
by the defendants' predecessors in office. These defendants were in no wise 
connected with the bank nor were they in any way responsible for those losses. 
To interpret article 30 so would result in the incoming manager becoming an heir 
to an insolvent inheritance. Under such conditions no one would be found to 
accept the office and the bank would have to cease its operations.</p>
<p>As to the responsibility of the defendants for the losses which occurred 
during the period covered by the complaint, it might be said in the first place 
that the greater part of these losses constitutes the third cause of action of 
appellant's complaint and was made the subject of a separate appeal to this 
court. In the second place, it has not been shown that any part of such losses 
were written off as bad debts during the period of time in question. And it is 
upon this fact that we rest our holding on this point. Therefore, we are not now 
called upon to decide whether the defendants could have treated these losses in 
the same manner as they did those occurring prior to December 31, 1905. </p>
<p>The judgment appealed from was affirmed.1 In this opinion it has been our 
intention to set forth at some length our reasons for affirming this judgment at 
the close of the last session.</p>
