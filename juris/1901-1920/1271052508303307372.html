				<BR><STRONG>CARSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The evidence of record in this&nbsp; case fully&nbsp; sustains the findings of fact by the trial court.&nbsp;&nbsp; There can be no reasonable doubt&nbsp; that&nbsp; the defendant offered an officer of the Bureau of Internal&nbsp; Revenue the sum&nbsp; of P5&nbsp; a barrel for each and every barrel of&nbsp; spirits which that officer would permit&nbsp; defendant to withdraw&nbsp; from&nbsp; the&nbsp; warehouse, in which&nbsp; it&nbsp; was&nbsp; stored, without exacting&nbsp; the taxes&nbsp; which under the law&nbsp; the defendant would otherwise&nbsp; be required to pay; that the officer, while pretending to accept the offer, and&nbsp; to enter into the proposed agreement, did not in fact do so,&nbsp; and on the contrary, reported the matter to his superiors, and procured the arrest&nbsp; of the defendant just after five&nbsp; barrels of&nbsp; spirits had been&nbsp; removed&nbsp; from the warehouse, under his simulated agreement to accept the bribe offered him;&nbsp; and that while&nbsp; the spirits&nbsp; were removed from&nbsp; the&nbsp; warehouse,&nbsp; they never in fact passed beyond&nbsp; the control of the internal-revenue officers.<br><br>Upon these&nbsp; facts the trial court&nbsp; found&nbsp; the defendant guilty&nbsp; of bribery (<span style="font-style: italic;">cohecho</span>); but&nbsp; under&nbsp; the&nbsp; rulings laid down by this court in many analogous cases, proof of these facts establishes the guilt of the defendant not of the consummated crime of bribery (<span style="font-style: italic;">cohecho</span>), as held by the trial judge,&nbsp; but of an attempt&nbsp; to commit that crime.&nbsp;&nbsp; (U. S. <i> vs</i>. Gloria, 4 Phil. Rep., 341; U. S. <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Paua, 6 Phil.&nbsp; Rep., 740; U. S.<i> vs</i>.&nbsp; Camacan, 7 Phil. Rep., 329; U.
