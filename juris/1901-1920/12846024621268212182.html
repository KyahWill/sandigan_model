				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Paragraph 2 of section 106 of Act No. 2339 provides, among other things, that 
"whenever the amount of raw materials received into any factory exceeds the 
amount of manufactured or partially manufactured product on hand and lawfully 
removed from the factory, plus waste removed or destroyed, and a reasonable 
allowance for unavoidable loss in manufacture, the Collector of Internal Revenue 
may assess and collect the tax due on the products which should have been 
produced from the excess."
<p>The plaintiff for sometime prior to the commencement of the present action 
was the owner of a tobacco factory in Betis, Guagua, in the Province of 
Pampanga, P. I., and from time to time purchased large quantities of tobacco for 
the purpose of manufacturing the same into chewing tobacco and cigarettes. When 
the raw material was purchased, it was placed in a <em>bodega</em> within the 
factory, and was removed therefrom as it was necessary for the purpose of 
manufacturing it into chewing tobacco and cigarettes. From time to time a 
representative of the Collector of Internal Revenue, for the purpose of 
collecting the tax due on the manufactured product in accordance with section 69 
of said Act No. 2339, took an account of the amount of raw material on hand 
which had not been manufactured as above indicated. In the month of December, 
1915, said representative made an invoice of the raw material purchased by the 
plaintiff and the amount of material manufactured out of the same; found that 
there was a difference, after making due allowance for unavoidable loss in 
manufacture, waste, etc., of 1,797 kilos; and that the tax due on said amount, 
had the same been manufactured, was the sum of P1,034.64. A demand for the 
payment of said sum (P1,034.64) was made upon the plaintiff. He paid said amount 
under protest, and now seeks to recover the same upon the theory that it had 
been illegally collected.</p>
<p>The lower court found that the plaintiff had purchased 1,797 kilos of tobacco 
more than he had accounted for; that the amount of tax which should have been 
paid on said amount was P1,034.64; and that, therefore, the tax had been legally 
collected and rendered a judgment dismissing the action, without any finding as 
to costs. If that finding is in accordance with the facts, then the judgment of 
the lower court should be affirmed.</p>
<p>In making the invoice the defendant allowed a loss of 2 per cent in the 
drying of the tobacco. The appellant claims that that allowance was not 
sufficient. The record contains no proof showing that 2 per cent was not a 
reasonable allowance for that purpose. The appellant further attempts to show 
that if there was a loss or shortage, he was not responsible for the same, for 
the reason that a representative of the defendant was in constant charge of the 
<em>bodega</em> in which the raw material was placed from time to time as it was 
purchased. He further asserts that the representative of the defendant had the 
only key for said <em>bodega</em>, and that no person could remove raw material 
therefrom without the consent of said representative. The fact is that the 
<em>bodega</em> was under the charge of a representative of the defendant; that 
he had, so far as was known, the only key for the lock on a door leading into 
the <em>bodega</em>. The proof shows, however, that the lock was an ordinary 
lock; that the key was an ordinary key purchased in one of the <em>tiendas</em> 
in the place where the <em>bodega</em> was located. The proof further shows, 
however that it was possible for the raw material to be taken out of said 
<em>bodega</em> without the consent or knowledge of the representative of the 
defendant. That fact, taken in relation with Exhibit F which shows that upon the 
taking of other invoices in said <em>bodega</em>, the plaintiff had been short 
several times before in the quantity of tobacco which he should have had on 
hand, makes the conclusion irresistible that the plaintiff is responsible for 
the present shortage. Some of the shortages which were found existing on other 
occasions were much larger than the shortage found to exist at the time 
complained of in the present action.</p>
<p>Section 106 requires the manufacturers to keep books prescribed by the 
Collector of Internal Revenue. Said books showed that the plaintiff should have 
had on hand 33,267 kilos of raw material at the time of the invoice had he 
manufactured none of said material. Said books further show that he manufactured 
30,163 kilos. The Collector of Internal Revenue allowed 2 per cent for 
unavoidable loss, or the amount of 1,307 kilos, making a total of 31,470 kilos. 
The difference, therefore, between what he should have had and what he actually 
had was the amount of 1,797 kilos, which was the shortage the defendant found to 
exist at the time of the last invoice.</p>
<p>After a careful examination of the evidence adduced we are of the opinion 
that none of the errors assigned were committed.</p>
<p>Therefore, the judgment of the lower court is hereby affirmed, with costs. So 
ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Carson, Araullo, Street</em>, and <em>Malcolm, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p></div>
