				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. FLORENCIO PARAS, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.

				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Between 9 and 10 p. m. on September 9, 1906, as Florencio Paras and Feliciano Gadula were in a <em>carenderia</em> or eating place situated near the market of the town  of Angeles, Pampanga, James Reed,  an American negro, made his appearance therein and at once approached the said Paras and entered into conversation with him; shortly thereafter the aforesaid two individuals  left  in the direction of  the market; Keed followed them, and  on nearing Paras  attacked the latter, striking him in the  face with  his fist In consequence the assaulted man fell to the ground, where Reed repeatedly kicked him, but immediately after this aggression the accused fired four shots with a revolver at  the deceased, wounding him in  the right arm, in the lumbar region, and in the gluteal region, from the result of which wounds he fell dead.  Upon hearing the shots, three members of the municipal police of the town, Maximino Samia, Lucas Ocampo, and Monico Pingal, repaired  to the place of the occurrence and found the accused with  a .38-caliber Colt  revolver and  leather holster,  in his hand, and  at a distance of about 12 meters the body of James Reed was lying on the ground with three wounds upon it.</p>
<p>For the above reasons, a complaint was filed by the provincial fiscal  with  the  Court of First  Instance accusing Florencio Paras 'of the crime  of homicide, and in  view of the result thereof the judge, on the 16th of January, this year, entered  judgment sentencing the  accused   to  the penalty of twelve years and one day of <em>reclusion temporal</em>, to pay an indemnity of P1,000 to the heirs of the deceased James Reed, and the costs.  From said judgment  the accused appealed.</p>
<p>The above-stated  facts, fully proven in the present case, constitute the crime of  homicide defined and punished by article 404 of the Penal Code since it is an unquestionable fact, confessed by the accused himself, that owing to his having been violently assaulted by James Reed, the American negro, he fired four shots at his aggressor, and  that three of such shots seriously wounded said aggressor and caused, his death shortly after,   None of the characteristics of the crime of murder as enumerated in  article  403 of the code were present herein.</p>
<p>The accused, Florencio Paras pleaded not guilty and alleged in his defense  that without any cause or reason whatever he was assaulted by the deceased and knocked down and in consequence of the blow he  received in the face it swelled up and his nose bled; that while  on  the ground Reed kicked him; therefore, in proper self-defense he fired several shots at his aggressor  with  the  revolver which he carried in his hand.</p>
<p>It is true that the accused alleged that the  weapon belonged to his assailant, from whom he managed to snatch it a. moment before when the  deceased  tried to shoot the~ accused, the revolver, however, missing fire; but this allegation of the accused is incredible and we consider  it as a defense resorted to since the particulars of the case do not establish the conviction that  the  weapon belonged to the deceased.  Persons  who  know him and conversed  frequently  with him never saw any firearm in his possession, and. it is not likely that if Paras managed to snatch the revolver from the deceased as the latter attempted to shoot him he also succeeded in getting hold of  the holster.</p>
<p>However, in considering the allegation made  by the accused in his defense it is immaterial to us whether the revolver belonged to the deceased or to the accused, because the essential point  in the case is that without any known cause or reason, Florencio Paras, in the darkness of night, was assaulted  in a brutal  manner by James Reed, who knocked him down, and the assaulted party in self-defense fired at  his assailant  several shots with the revolver he carried in his hand.</p>
<p>From  the facts proven in these proceedings it is inferred that the three requisites named in No. 4 of article 8 of the Penal Code are present in the homicide, inasmuch as without previous provocation on the part of the accused Paras, he was suddenly and violently assaulted, being struck in the face, the blows causing blood  to flow, and as a result of the aggression he was laid flat on the ground, where he was kicked; given the rapidity with which the act was carried out  and the imminence of the danger, it  is impossible to affirm that being already prostrate on the ground  the assault of which he was the victim would have ceased.  It is reasonable to believe that the accused, when he defended himself by shooting his assailant, did not exceed his rights in his  defense  or employ unnecessary means to repel an attack already  commenced in  a cruel and violent manner or to prevent its continuation, because from the suddenness of the attack, the end thereof, without risk to his person, could not be assured.  It would not be proper or reasonable to claim  that he should have fled or selected a less deadly weapon,  because in the emergency in which,  without any reason whatever,  he was placed, and  being attacked by a person larger and stronger than himself, there was nothing more natural than to have made use of the weapon he held, in order to defend himself; anyone, upon being assaulted in a similar manner,  would have  acted likewise  In  the natural order of things, following the instinct of self-preservation, he was compelled to resort to a proper defense; an impossibility can not be demanded of the injured person when it can not be  affirmed that  he could have done less than he did in  defending himself by  shooting at his assailant who had maltreated him and knocked him down.</p>
<p>The reasonable necessity of the means employed in the defense, according to the jurisprudence of courts, does not depend  upon the harm done, but rests upon the imminent danger of such injury.   (Decision of Dec. 22, 1887.)</p>
<p>With the sole purpose of setting forth herein the constant opinion of the supreme court of Spain in respect to the application of paragraph 4 of article 8 of the Penal Code of 1870, similar in this  connection to  the one in force in these Islands,  the  opinion of  the well-known  and  reputable writer Sr. Viada, on  page 99, Volume I of his, work, is here quoted.   It reads:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The questions of  lawful defense are undoubtedly those which in greater number  are submitted to the decision of the supreme court, by means of cassation proceedings, generally instituted by the  counsel of the culprits on account of violations of article 8, No. 4, of the Penal Code.  Therefore the decisions rendered  in this matter are very numerous.   It being impossible to make an extract of all  of them, we will limit  ourselves to pointing out the eases, unfortunately  too frequent, wherein the supreme court has declared that an appeal  should be considered by it because the <em>sala sentenciadora</em> (sentencing chamber)  failed to apply in part or in whole, as it should, the exemption from criminal liability in  favor of the culprit pursuant to said article and number, or according to article 87, which directs that the penalty lower  by one or two. degrees than that imposed by law  shall be applied when the number of the concurrent requisites is greater than is needed to exempt from criminal liability in the respective cases dealt with in article 8.</p>
  <p>"On the other hand, the jurisprudence of  the supreme court does not register but a <em>very limited number</em> of cases wherein it has been held  that  the sentencing court  has improperly applied the  said circumstance of exemption from criminal responsibility in favor of the culprit or that the prosecuting attorney, the ever-faithful representative and keeper of the law, has instituted cassation proceedings in said sense.   This is a  most peculiar phenomenon which ought justly to call the attention of judges and tribunals, and give them  to understand the necessity of somewhat mitigating the  excessive severity shown by them in this important matter, as a  general rule,  in connection with the  judgments  finally reversed  and annulled  by the  supreme court."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Following the doctrine of the courts and the settled interpretation of said article and number of the Penal Code, the accused in the present case  should be  exempted from all liability as to  the homicide in question, and therefore, under the  considerations  above set forth, it is our opinion that the judgment appealed from should be reversed and, by virtue  of his complete exemption,  Florencio  Paras is hereby acquitted, with the costs of both instances <em>de oficio</em>. and his bail is hereby canceled.   So ordered.</p>
