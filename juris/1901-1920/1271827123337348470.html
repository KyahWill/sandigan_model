				<H3>LAUREANO ARZADON,  PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS.  CLOTILDE ARZADON, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>ARELLANO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Laureano Arzadon, as administrator of the estate of Lorenza Angco, demands the surrender of several rural properties which he states are held by the following persons: By Clotilde Arzadon, those described in the complaint and indicated by the letters (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>), (<i>c)</i>,&nbsp; (<i>d</i>), (<i>e</i>), (<i>f)</i>, (<i>g</i>), W, (<i>i)</i>, (<i>j)</i>,&nbsp; (<i>k</i>), and (<i>l</i>); and by Maria&nbsp; Luna, Basilia Corpus,&nbsp; and Ponciano Tacmo&nbsp; those likewise described in the complaint and marked with the letters (<i>m</i>), <i>(n</i>),&nbsp; and (<i>n</i>).&nbsp; He states that the&nbsp; first-named parcels&nbsp; were taken possession of&nbsp; by Clotilde&nbsp; Arzadon immediately after the death of&nbsp; Lorenza&nbsp; Angco,&nbsp; and&nbsp; that she still retains them against the will of the heirs of the latter;&nbsp; and that the last three are also unlawfully held by Maria&nbsp; Luna, Basilia Corpus, and Ponciano Tacmo who took them from the possession of Clotilde Arzadon.<br><br>The&nbsp; evidence was presented&nbsp; in the manner contained in the following recorded statement:<br><blockquote>"At the trial of this case on the same day, the attorneys, to expedite&nbsp; the matter, agreed to file their allegations in writing in order that the trial court might render judgment at the hearing thereof, and the parties thereupon submitted their written allegations in the&nbsp; form of statements of their respective witnesses."</blockquote>These&nbsp; so-called&nbsp; proofs are nothing more&nbsp; than&nbsp; certain papers signed by the counsel of the contending parties, and containing averments seemingly made by various witnesses. At the bottom of that of the plaintiff, which is signed by Attorney A. M. Jimenez, there appears the following:<br><blockquote>"The undersigned attorney rejects all and each one of the immaterial proofs&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant may offer&nbsp; to&nbsp; the court, denies under oath&nbsp; the&nbsp; presentation of documents lacking legal 'validity, the declarations that may be in conflict with those&nbsp; made by the witnesses of the defendant, excepting therefrom in case of admission by the court, and, lastly, presents two documentary&nbsp; proofs, Exhibits A and B of the complaint."<br></blockquote>That of the defendant, signed by Attorney Lucas Paredes, contains the following:<br><blockquote>"The defendants object to the documents which the plaintiff has&nbsp; offered as evidence, for the reason that they are immaterial, and&nbsp; in the event their objection is overruled they&nbsp; take exception thereto.&nbsp; As documentary&nbsp; proof&nbsp; they offer&nbsp; Exhibits 1, 2 and 3 of the&nbsp; defendants, and with this they rest their case."<br></blockquote>On such proceedings the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Ilocos Norte rendered the following judgment:<br><blockquote><br>"Inasmuch as&nbsp; the whole of&nbsp; the&nbsp; allegations of the complaint have not been proven as required by law, the court dismisses the same with respect to&nbsp; the&nbsp; parcels of&nbsp; land marked with the letters&nbsp; (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>), (<i>c</i>), (<i>d</i>),&nbsp; (<i>e)</i>,&nbsp; (<i>k<!--<I--></i>), (<span style="font-style: italic;">I</span>), (<i>m</i>),&nbsp; (<i>n</i>), and&nbsp; (<i>n)</i>,&nbsp; with the costs against the&nbsp; plaintiff. The latter may dispose as he wishes of the parcels indicated with&nbsp; the letters&nbsp; (<i>f</i>),&nbsp; (<i>g</i>), (<i>h</i>),&nbsp; (<i>i)</i>, and (<i>j</i>), inasmuch as no one is opposed thereto, without&nbsp; prejudice to attaching to the record hereof a copy of the plaintiff's petition&nbsp; concerning the appointment of an administrator contained in the heading of civil case No.&nbsp; 569."<br></blockquote>From&nbsp; the above decision&nbsp; the plaintiff&nbsp; has&nbsp; appealed, and assigned the following errors to the court below:<br><br>1. In having admitted the agreement presented by counsel in order to dispense with the trial of the case.&nbsp; 2. In having dismissed the complaint instead of holding it to be proven. 3. In overruling the motion&nbsp; for a new trial.<br><br>Among the irregularities contained in the case herein, the most&nbsp; remarkable&nbsp; is that which is alleged as the first error committed in the judgment, the attorney who&nbsp; alleges it being the same one who contributed thereto, and who&nbsp; also suffered&nbsp; therefrom by exposing&nbsp; his complaint&nbsp; to be&nbsp; dismissed on account of lack&nbsp; of legal proof.&nbsp; This lawyer, together with the counsel for the adverse party, moved&nbsp; that his proof be admitted in the form in which it was made, in order, as he now shows, to dispense with&nbsp; the hearing of the case.&nbsp; Such form of procedure can&nbsp; not&nbsp; constitute a trial. It is an open and manifest violation among others, of sections 132, 273, 274, and 381 of the Code of Civil Procedure, Act No. 190 of the Philippine Commission;&nbsp; of&nbsp; section 132, in so far&nbsp; as it establishes the order of the trial which in this cause has been entirely done away with; of section 273, which&nbsp; governs the manner&nbsp; in&nbsp; which&nbsp; the&nbsp; evidence shall be considered as regards&nbsp; "all the facts and circumstances of the&nbsp; case, the witnesses'&nbsp; manner of&nbsp; testifying,&nbsp; their intelligence, their means and opportunity of knowing&nbsp; the facts to which they are testifying, the nature&nbsp; of the facts to which&nbsp; they testify, the probability or improbability of their testimony, their&nbsp; interest&nbsp; or want&nbsp; of interest, and also&nbsp; their personal credibility&nbsp; so far&nbsp; as the&nbsp; same may legitimately appear upon the trial;" of section 274, in so far as it provides that the rules&nbsp; of evidence shall be the same in all courts of the Islands,&nbsp; and upon&nbsp; every trial,&nbsp; unless otherwise expressly provided&nbsp; by statute; and of section 381, which prescribes that&nbsp; the testimony of all&nbsp; witnesses, except such as has been taken in writing in the form of <i>depositions</i> as otherwise provided&nbsp; by law, shall be given on oath in open court orally.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; also a singular circumstance that&nbsp; the appellant&nbsp; should claim&nbsp; to have&nbsp; proven&nbsp; his complaint by evidence which he now rejects and says was improperly&nbsp; admitted.<br><br>This&nbsp; Supreme Court,&nbsp; before which the case&nbsp; is submitted for a review of the proofs thus presented, can not even admit them; they do not constitute legal proof&nbsp; of any&nbsp; kind. It is erroneous to say that it was the duty of the court below to accept the agreements of the parties, not with respect to the facts, but as to the manner of offering their respective proofs.&nbsp;&nbsp; The order of trials&nbsp; is not a personal matter between the parties, one&nbsp; that they may ignore or renounce as if it only concerned them privately.&nbsp;&nbsp; The form of a trial is a matter of public order and interest.<br><br>A legal trial of the case must be held, and the judgment appealed from and all&nbsp; the proceedings, with the exception of the written allegations, are hereby set aside;&nbsp; a new trial is hereby ordered, to proceed&nbsp; from the time of the filing of the answer&nbsp; to the complaint, without any&nbsp; special ruling as to costs in this instance.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Torres, Johnson, Carson, Moreland</i>, and <i>Elliott, JJ.</i>, concur.<br></div>
