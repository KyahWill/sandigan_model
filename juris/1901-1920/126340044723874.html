				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On a written  complaint filed by the assistant provincial fiscal of Albay on the 13th of June,  1905, Braulio Tupular was charged with the crime of <em>coaccion</em> in that on or about the 13th of July, 1904, he, the said Tupular, in the town of Caramoran, Island of  Catanduanes,  Province of  Albay, without being  lawfully authorized, compelled the  Chinaman Chan Chinco to deliver to him certain goods belonging to  the  said  Chinaman,  such  as  cloth,  rice,  and  other articles of  merchandise, to the value of P2,000, more or less, in payment of a certain indebtedness, and, notwithstanding the protest and refusal of the Chinaman, the defendant, aided by his agents, took and seized the said goods and carried them to his house without order of court.  All of this contrary  to  the statute in  such  cases  made and provided.</p>
<p>The case having proceeded to trial  upon the said complaint, the court, after hearing tin1 evidence adduced, rendered judgment on the 4th of September, 1905, convicting the defendant of the crime charged and sentencing him to six months'  imprisonment (<em>arresto mayor</em>), to pay a fine of 325 pesetas, and in case of insolvency to suiter the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment,  this not  to exceed one-third of  the principal penalty, with the accessories of the law and the costs  of proceedings,  reserving to  the Chinaman the right to institute a civil  action to recover his property or  the  value thereof and  such  damages  as he had incurred, from which judgment  and sentence  the defendant appealed.</p>
<p>It appears from the evidence, in this case that the Chinaman Chan Chinco was engaged in mercantile business in the town of Calogbon, Island of Catandunnes, Province of Albay; that  at the suggestion of the defendant, the Chinaman took the goods which he had in his  store to the town of Caramoran  of the  same1 province, in a  <em>parao</em>, or <em>baroto </em>belonging to  the defendant;  that in July, 19)04, the defendant went to  Caramoran and notified  the said Chinaman that he had come there for the purpose of collecting what the latter owed to Antonio  de  la Riva, of Manila,  from whom he claimed  to have  ample power to  collect  and demand payment of said debt;  that the Chinaman Chan Chinco answered that he had no money with which to pay him, whereupon the accused informed him that the would proceed to make an inventory of all the goods then in  the Chinaman's store for the purpose of ascertaining the value thereof, to which the  Chinaman did not' object; that  the inventory was  made on the 11th  of July of the same year by the defendant with the assistance  of  three Chinamen who were  employed for that purpose, the taking of  the inventory being begun in the morning  and finished in  the afternoon; that upon the completion of the inventory  the defendant insisted upon die  payment of  the debt and  the Chinaman told him that the would speak to another Chinaman to get him to guarantee the debt,  to which the  defendant agreed; that about the  12th or  13th of July  the defendant returned to the  store of the Chinaman  Chan riiinco and stated to him that he must either pay the debt or the, the defendant,  would take the  goods, and  in  view of the fact that neither the Chinaman nor his surety, Dy Biangco,  had money,  the defendant, Tupular, by means of his <em>cargadores</em>,  took  from the store of the Chinaman all the goods which the latter had, together with a trunk, several pictures, the Chinaman's certificate of registration, and about P130 in cash, and carried them to another house near  by, notwithstanding the protest  and refusal of the Chinaman; the defendant ignored the Chinaman's objection and the latter did not show any further opposition for the reason that he knew that the defendant had a revolver in his trunk, which had been left in his, the Chinaman's store, and thus  the goods were forcibly taken away by  the defendant ; that,  according to the Chinaman, these goods were  worth  P2,000; and that it appears from the record that the Chinaman  Chan Chinco actually owed to Antonio do la  Riva,  of Manila, the sum  of P1,004 on account of which indebtedness the Chinaman had already paid to the defendant the sum  of P800.</p>
<p>The facts as established in this case show the commission of the crime of <em>coaccion</em> as defined in article 498 of the Penal Code which provides:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The who with violence shall appropriate a thing  belonging to his debtor in order to pay himself therewith shall be punished with the penalties of arresto mayor in its minimum degree and a fine equivalent to the value of the thing, but in no ease under 325 pesetas."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The defendant, as the agent of the creditor, Antonio de la Riva, took forcible  possession of the goods which the debtor, the Chinaman  Chan  Chinco, had  in  his store in the town of  Caramoran, Island of Catanduanes, Province of Albay, against the will and regardless of the objection of the debtor, in order to pay the debt of his principal therewith.</p>
<p>The defendant pleaded  not guilty, and alleged that after the goods were inventoried he ordered that the same be removed from the Chinaman's store to another place with the consent of the debtor, who voluntarily transferred these goods to him in payment of his indebtedness to De la Riva, no receipt for the said goods having been given  nor any document evidencing the payment of the debt executed, for the reason that the account of the Chinaman had net been definitely settled.</p>
<p>The evidence, however,  is insufficient  to  support  the claim of the defendant that the Chinaman  had transferred to him the said goods in payment of the debt.  If this were true there would have been no necessity for him imposing upon the Chinaman, ignoring his protests,  and forcibly taking the goods for the purpose of paying the claim of his principal with  the said goods.  The defendant employed violence and  intimidation upon  the owner of the said goods, and he also employed physical violence when he forcibly removed the goods from the store.</p>
<p>As to the exact value of the goods in question  there is no definite proof, and in view of contradictory testimony of the parties upon this point the  doubt thus  arising from such  conflicting evidence should be decided in favor of the defendant who claims that the goods were worth MOO, and this for the purpose only of fixing the penalty that should be imposed under article 498 of  the  Penal Code,  without prejudice to the right of the Chinaman to  recover hi a proper civil action such damages  as he may thereby have incurred  in addition to the actual value  of the said goods.</p>
<p>There is no extenuating or aggravating circumstance to be. considered  in  connection with the commission of  the crime, nor even the special circumstance provided  in paragraph 11 of article 10 of  the Penal  Code, as it does not appear that  the defendant took  advantage of his official position as auxiliary justice of the peace  of the  town  of Calogbon, which is distinct from  the  town of Caramoran where the crime was  committed,  and the  penalty should therefore be inflicted in its medium degree.</p>
<p>We accordingly reverse the judgment of  the court below and hereby sentence Braulio Tupular to one month and twenty clays' imprisonment (<em>arresto  mayor</em>)  with the accessories  prescribed in article 61 of  the  code, to pay a fine of P600, and in case of insolvency to suffer subsidiary imprisonment  not to exceed one-third  of the principal penalty, with the costs of both instances, and without prejudice to the rights of the Chinaman Chan Chinco to maintain a  civil  action for  damages against the  defendant Tupular.</p>
<p>After the expiration of ten days from the  rendition of final judgment, the record will be remanded  to the court below for execution.  So  ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J.,  Mapa, Carson, Willard,</em> and <em>Tracey, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
