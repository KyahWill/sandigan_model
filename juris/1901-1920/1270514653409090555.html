				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The defendant in this case was charged in the Court of First Instance of Manila with the crime of <i>defraudacion de&nbsp; propiedad&nbsp; literaria </i>(fraud or infringement of literary rights or property) as defined and penalized in article 539 of the Penal Code.&nbsp; The information charges substantially that the defendant, with intent to defraud, and to the prejudice of the complaining&nbsp; witness, the owner of&nbsp; a&nbsp; certain literary work, a "Reduction&nbsp; Table," feloniously, fraudulently&nbsp; and without authority copied,&nbsp; printed&nbsp; and&nbsp; reproduced&nbsp; this&nbsp; "Reduction&nbsp; Table" and sold and&nbsp; distributed fraudulent copies thereof&nbsp; to the&nbsp; damage and prejudice of the complaining witness in&nbsp; the sum of P3,000.<br><br>Defendant was duly arraigned&nbsp; and pleaded not guilty in one&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; divisions&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Manila, and after certain further proceedings which it is not necessary to set out at this&nbsp; time,&nbsp; the case was transferred to the division of that court presided over by the Hon. A. S. Crossfield, before whom it was tried.<br><br>The prosecution presented a number of witnesses&nbsp; whose testimony tended to support the truth of the allegations of the&nbsp; information touching&nbsp; the unauthorized reproduction and sale by the defendant of the pamphlet or booklet, containing tables&nbsp; of comparative values of&nbsp; weights and measures in&nbsp; the metric system and the&nbsp; system of weights and measures commonly known&nbsp; as&nbsp; the&nbsp; English&nbsp; system,&nbsp; which is referred to in the following certificate, signed and&nbsp; sealed by the chief of the division of archives, patents, copyrights and trade-marks, and dated May&nbsp; 10, 1909.<br><blockquote>"This is to certify that by the records of the division of archives,&nbsp; patents, copyrights and&nbsp; trade-marks, it appears that Manuel&nbsp; Castell,&nbsp; of the city of Manila, Philippine Islands, did, on the eighth day&nbsp; of May, nineteen hundred and&nbsp; nine, deposit in said division for registration a book entitled 'Tabla de Reduccion,' and the date of the receipt thereof was duly noted and recorded; and protection thereof will&nbsp; remain in force from said date in accordance with the Spanish Law of Jan. 10, 1879, royal decrees of Sept. 3, 1880, and&nbsp; May 5, 1887."<br></blockquote>Thereafter&nbsp; the Government&nbsp; closed&nbsp; its&nbsp; case&nbsp; and&nbsp; the defendant moved for a dismissal&nbsp; on the ground that the evidence submitted on behalf of the Government did not establish&nbsp; the&nbsp; commission of the&nbsp; offense charged in the information, or of any offense defined and penalized by law. Judgment on this motion was&nbsp; reserved by the&nbsp; court at the&nbsp; request of counsel for both parties, who desired to submit briefs on&nbsp; the legal questions&nbsp; raised by the motion. Pending judgment on the motion,&nbsp; defendant submitted his evidence.&nbsp; Subsequently, upon consideration of the motion to dismiss submitted after the Government closed its case, and&nbsp; as to which judgment had been reserved, the&nbsp; court below sustained the&nbsp; motion and&nbsp; discharged&nbsp; the defendant.<br><br>The&nbsp; trial&nbsp; court based its judgment dismissing the&nbsp; information and discharging the defendant on the ground that no copyright law exists in the Philippine Islands and that the complaining witness could have no exclusive&nbsp; rights in the pamphlet in question which were subject to&nbsp; violation or infringement, so as to sustain a conviction under article 539&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Penal&nbsp; Code.&nbsp;&nbsp; No finding was made as to the alleged facts touching the reproduction&nbsp; by the defendant of the pamphlet of which ownership is claimed by the complaining witness.<br><br>The&nbsp; case has been brought here by the&nbsp; Government in an attempt to appeal from the judgment of the court below. We are asked to reverse that judgment&nbsp; and grant a new trial, on the ground that the trial judge erred in declaring that no copyright law&nbsp; is in&nbsp; force in these Islands.&nbsp;&nbsp; But without&nbsp; going&nbsp; into the question&nbsp; of the correctness of&nbsp; the conclusions of&nbsp; law upon&nbsp; which the trial judge&nbsp; based&nbsp; his action, we are all agreed that the government had no right of appeal from the judgment entered by the court below dismissing the&nbsp; information and discharging the defendant.<br><br>The allowance of an appeal by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Government would undoubtedly place the defendant twice in jeopardy in violation of the provisions of the Philippine Bill&nbsp; of Rights,&nbsp; set out in the Act&nbsp; of Congress of July&nbsp; 1, 1902, as those provisions have&nbsp; been&nbsp; construed by the&nbsp; Supreme Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; the United States in the case of Kepner <i>vs.</i> United States (195 U. S., 100;&nbsp; 11 Phil. Rep., 669).<br><br>Defendant was regularly arraigned, pleaded not&nbsp; guilty, put upon his trial by the calling of the government's witnesses against&nbsp; him, and thereafter&nbsp; discharged by the trial court.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is true that the court made&nbsp; no express finding as to whether&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant did&nbsp; or did not commit&nbsp; the specific acts set out in the information, and&nbsp; that the dismissal of the information was based on the court's conclusion of law that there being no copyright law in force in these Islands, the acts which it is alleged were&nbsp; committed by the defendant do not constitute the crime with which he was charged, nor any&nbsp; other offense&nbsp; defined and penalized by law.&nbsp; But the reasoning and authority of the opinion of the Supreme Court of the&nbsp; United States in the case of Kepner <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. United States, supra, is&nbsp; conclusively against&nbsp; the right of&nbsp; appeal by&nbsp; the government from a judgment discharging the defendant in a criminal case after he has been brought to trial, whether defendant was acquitted on&nbsp; the merits or whether&nbsp; defendant's discharge&nbsp; was based upon the trial&nbsp; court's conclusion of law that the trial&nbsp; had failed for some reason to&nbsp; establish&nbsp; the guilt of the defendant as charged.<br><br>As&nbsp; indicated&nbsp; in the opinion in that case,&nbsp; the&nbsp; protection afforded by the prohibition against the putting of any person twice in jeopardy for the same&nbsp; offense, is a&nbsp; protection not merely&nbsp; against the peril of second punishment, but against being tried a second time for the same offense.&nbsp;&nbsp; In that case the court expressly held that:<br><blockquote>"It follows that Military Order No. 58, as&nbsp; amended&nbsp; by Act of the Philippine Commission, No, 194, in so far as it undertakes&nbsp; to permit an appeal by the Government after acquittal, was repealed by the Act&nbsp; of Congress of July, 1902, providing&nbsp; immunity from second jeopardy for&nbsp; the same criminal offense."</blockquote>But the reasoning of the opinion goes further and denies the right to the Government to procure the reversal of erroneous proceedings and commence anew, save only in those cases in which the fir3t proceeding did not create legal jeopardy.&nbsp; So that, without his own consent, a defendant who has once been brought to trial in a court of competent jurisdiction cannot&nbsp; be&nbsp; again put&nbsp; on trial for&nbsp; the same offense after the first trial has&nbsp; terminated by a judgment directing his discharge, whether his discharge be the result of a formal acquittal, or of a ruling of the court upon some question&nbsp; of law arising&nbsp; at the trial.<br><br>This&nbsp; court has frequently&nbsp; held&nbsp; that&nbsp; legal jeopardy attaches&nbsp; in&nbsp; criminal&nbsp; proceedings in this jurisdiction after arraignment and&nbsp; plea in a court of competent jurisdiction, at the moment when the first witness is called to the stand and interrogated, and it is&nbsp; quite clear that the defendant in this case having&nbsp; been brought to trial after arraignment and plea and all the government's witnesses having testified on his trial, is entitled to protection against the peril&nbsp; of being again brought to&nbsp; trial for the offense with which&nbsp; he was charged at that trial and this whether the rulings&nbsp; of the trial judge on which he based his order discharging the defendant and dismissing the information were or were not erroneous.&nbsp; (U. S. <i>vs.</i> Ballentine, 4 Phil. Rep., 672; U.&nbsp; S. <i>v</i>s. Montiel, 7 Phil. Rep.,&nbsp; 272;&nbsp; U.&nbsp; S. <i>vs.</i> Gemora, 8 Phil. Rep.,&nbsp; 19.)<br><br>What is said in the following citation from the decision of the Supreme&nbsp; Court&nbsp; in&nbsp; the case of Kepner <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; U.&nbsp; S., <i>supra</i>, and the observations of Mr. Bishop therein quoted, have a proper place in this opinion as bearing directly on the precise point under consideration.<br><blockquote>"We are not here dealing with those statutes which give to the Government a right of review upon the steps merely preliminary to a trial and before the accused is legally put in jeopardy,&nbsp; as where a&nbsp; discharge&nbsp; is had upon motion to quash or a demurrer to the indictment is sustained before jeopardy has attached.&nbsp; Such statutes have been quite gen- erally sustained in jurisdictions which&nbsp; deny the right of second trial&nbsp; where a competent court has convicted&nbsp; or acquitted&nbsp; the accused.&nbsp; (People <i>vs</i>. Webb, 38&nbsp; Cal., 467.) Mr.&nbsp; Bishop, in his work upon&nbsp; Criminal&nbsp; Law, sums up the scope and authority of such statutes as follows:<br><br><blockquote>" 'A legislative&nbsp; provision for the rehearing of criminal causes can not be&nbsp; interpreted - or, at least, it can not have force - to violate the constitutional rule under consideration, whatever be the words in&nbsp; which the provision is expressed. When, therefore, a defendant&nbsp; has been once in jeopardy, the jeopardy&nbsp; can not be repeated without his consent, whatever statute may exist on the subject.&nbsp; Such a statute will be interpreted with the Constitution, and be held to apply only to cases where it constitutionally may.&nbsp; And if it undertakes to give to the State the right of appeal, to retry the party&nbsp; charged, after acquittal,&nbsp; it is invalid.&nbsp; And so&nbsp; the writ of error, or the like, allowed to the State, can authorize the State to procure the reversal of erroneous&nbsp; proceedings and commence anew, only in those cases in which the first proceeding did not create legal jeopardy.'&nbsp;&nbsp; (1 Bishop Criminal&nbsp; Law&nbsp; (5th Ed.), section 1026.)"</blockquote></blockquote>The appeal entered in this case on behalf of the Government should be dismissed&nbsp; with&nbsp; costs against the appellant. So ordered.<br><br><i> Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Moreland, </i>and <i>Trent, JJ.,</i> concur.<br></div>
