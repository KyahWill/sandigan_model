				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This action was brought  to  recover possession of certain premises situated  in  the city of Manila, which are fully described in the  complaint, and for damages for the retention by the defendant.</p>
<p>The  Court  of  First Instance  of  Manila,  on the 15th of July, 1902, handed  down a decision holding that the lease under  which  the defendant claimed had been annulled, and awarding possession to the  plaintiff and assessing his damages at  the sum of 5,250 pesos, Mexican currency, and judgment was accordingly  entered against the defendant.</p>
<p>The defendant moved for a new trial July 23, 1902, on the ground of newly discovered evidence, and because the damages awarded were excessive.</p>
<p>On July 28 the defendant presented his bill of exceptions, the motion for a new  trial  having been denied, in  which exceptions it was alleged that the findings of fact by the court were  not sufficient to sustain a money judgment against the  defendant; that there was no  evidence as to the amount of damages;  that  there was no evidence to sustain the  judgment, other than for the  possession of the premises in question; and that the damages were not computed according to law.</p>
<p>The judge of the Court of First Instance having refused to sign the  bill of exceptions, certain  proceedings  were taken in the Supreme  Court for the  purpose of requiring him to  sign the same, but the parties to the suit finally agreed upon the bill  of exceptions which is before us.</p>
<p>The defendant now objects to it on the ground that the exceptions were not taken in time and also for the reason that the writing filed by the defendant July 28,  1903, does not disclose  what particular ruling, order, or judgment is intended to be excepted to.</p>
<p>We are of opinion that these objections on the part of the defendant are not well taken.  Inasmuch as the defendant moved for a new trial within  ten  days after the rendition of  the judgment and his motion was denied, and within three days after making this motion (the record does not disclose when the motion was decided) the defendant presented his exceptions, we hold that they were made in due time,  and that they raise the question as to whether or not the facts found by  the court below warrant the money judgment of 5,250 pesos.</p>
<p>As there seems to  be no assignment of error in the bill of exceptions applicable to that part  of  the  judgment awarding possession of the premises to the plaintiff, we are not called upon to pass upon that part of the judgment and  to apply the doctrine laid down by this court in the case of Donaldson, Sims  &amp; Co. <em>vs.</em>  Smith, Bell &amp;  Co.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> decided  April 23,  1902, in which  case we held that the plaintiffs "not having entered into possession under their lease1, they  had acquired no rights in the leased property in the nature of a right <em>in rem</em>, and which third persons warn therefore hound not to infringe," and therefore, on that account, the plaintiffs in that action "could not recover damages for the wrongful  occupancy  of the premises in question.</p>
<p>The only  question, therefore, to be considered is whether or not the  proper rule  of  damages  has been applied in this case and whether or not  the evidence warranted that part of the  judgment rendered for damages.</p>
<p>The learned judge who heard the  case below stated in his decision  that  the  testimony upon  the  question  of damages sustained by the plaintiff by reason of the unlawful possession of the defendant "is very  meager and unsatisfactory," and this is certainly true, for it  is vague, speculative, and not confined to the property in question.</p>
<p>It seems  that the plaintiff  occupied  as a saloon  a part of the building, that part thereof being known as Nos. 62 and 64 Calle San Fernando; and that the defendant occupied Nos. 56, 58, and 60 of the  same building and all the upper  story of the same,  and carried  on a  saloon business, restaurant, and lodging house.</p>
<p>Much  of the testimony as to damages or profits claimed by the plaintiff went to show, not what the actual profits were, but rather  what the plaintiff might expect them to be had lie possession of the whole property.  Thus Ramon Pazos, the lessor, testified that the plaintiff might expect, if he  had been in entire possession of the property, 800 or  900  pesos,  Mexican,  per  month,  and that he  based this opinion on the fact that it brought in  that  profit in 1898 and 1899, long before this  suit was  begun.   The plaintiff  himself  testified that he might reasonably have expected to  realize from  the possession of  the  <em>entire</em> building  $500, gold, per month "taking into consideration the injury to his business caused by the opening of another establishment next door to his."  Another witness testified that he knew where the building Nos. 56, 58, 60, 62, and 64 Calle  San Fernando  was situated, and that the profit which might reasonably be expected from the possession of "that building" ought to be "not less than 1,000 pesos per month."   The last witness who testified on the question of profit stated that he occupied, under the defendant, the restaurant; that for  the  first  four  months he made about  $200, gold,  above expenses;  that  for  the last two months he was hardly able to clear expenses, and  that latterly he had been obliged to draw on some money he had in order to defray expenses.</p>
<p>If the plaintiff sought  to make  such  proof as would riiiitle him to a money judgment for damages, under the provisions of article 455 of the Civil Code providing  that a possessor in bad faith shall pay for fruits collected and for those which the  possessor could have  received, he should have confined his proof to that part of the building occupied by the defendant and to  the legal measure of damages, not  to what profits he "might expect"  or what they "ought to be."   Such proof as this is too indefinite and uncertain to enable a proper conclusion to be reached regarding the  amount of damages.</p>
<p>In the case  of McMahon (114 Mass., 140)  the plaintiff sought to show the rental value of a strip of land if used in connection  with adjacent property, and with that  purpose in view  asked  a witness: "What would be  a  fair annual rental  of this passageway to be used in connection with the estate to which it belongs, situate as this estate is?"   The question was objected to  and  excluded, on the ground that the question to be determined was the value of the strip of land, without reference to  any particular or specific use to which it may or  may  not  be put, and, in excluding it, the  court  stated that "the annual value is not what it is worth either to the tenant or the plaintiff.   It has no tendency to prove the market value,  nor is it  material that it may be especially valuable to either by reason of any special or particular use to  which it has been or may be applied.   The annual value is what it is fairly and  reasonably worth under all  the  surrounding circumstances, in the market for any purpose, considering all its present  and future capabilities for use."</p>
<p>The provisions of the Louisiana Civil Code are somewhat similar to those of our Code relative to damages for wrongfully retaining possession of land,  viz: "He who knowingly keeps possession of another's estate is compelled to account for all profits, together with the land."</p>
<p>Under these requirements,  the Supreme Court of  the United States held, in the case of New Orleans <em>vs.</em> Gaines (15 Wallace, 624), that the damages for withholding possession from the  rightful  owner was the rental value, and cited with  approval  the  case of Vandevoort <em>vs.</em>  Gould (36 N. Y., 639), in which case it was decided that "mesne profits  are  what the premises are worth annually, with interest to  the time of the trial."</p>
<p>This, too, seems to he the view of the learned counsel for the  appellee,  for on  page  24 of his brief  we  find  the following:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"In the case  of Wallace, Executor, <em>vs.</em> Berdell et al., the Court of Appeals of New York (3 N.  E.  Rep.,  770), discussing the  terms "mesne  profits" and  "rental value," says:</p>
  <p>" 'It would be manifestly unjust to confine the owner of the property withheld from him to the rents actually received by the  party  required to  make restitution.  The owner should have either  those rents, or the rental value, as may be just under the circumstances.  *   *  *  The mesne profits consist of the net rents after deducting all necessary repairs and taxes,  or the net rental value,  or the value of the use and occupation.  That is all of which the party from whom possession  has  been withheld has been deprived.'"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is stated in volume  10 of the Encyclopedia of Law, page 540, that the universal rule is that the measure  of damages is the  fair rental value of the property withheld, and numerous cases are cited to sustain this proposition.</p>
<p>The general principle on which damages are allowed is, that the plaintiff is  entitled  to recover  damages fairly resulting from his having been  wrongfully  kept out  of possession.   Compensation is  the measure of  damages. Hence,  on  principle,  the  amount  of recovery for mesne profits is the annual value of the premises wrongfully withheld from the time plaintiff's title accrued.   (Nash  <em>vs.</em> Sullivan,  32 Minn., 189; Cutter <em>vs.</em> Waddingham, 33 Mo., 269.)</p>
<p>Section 84 of the Code of Civil  Procedure requires judgment to be rendered for the plaintiff, if the court finds the complaint to be true, ^f or restitution of the premises and costs of suit and for all  arrears of rent  or a reasonable compensation  for the use and occupation of the premises." This compensation is the rental value of the premises, and such value  could doubtless have  been easily ascertained; but, instead of adopting this rule  of ascertaining the damages suffered by the plaintiff, the court permitted witnesses  to  guess  at  the  profits which were "expected"  or which  "ought  to be" received, and ordered a money judgment upon  such  testimony, reaching the amount named "without any testimony," as was said "to guide the court." In arriving  at this conclusion the judge below stated:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"I have come to the  conclusion that the witnesses intended to convey the idea that the use of the  property, together with  the time, skill,  and capital of a man competent  to  operate the same for the purposes for which it has been operated, and the reasonable profits derived therefrom, would aggregate  $1,000, Mexican, per month, and, without any testimony to guide me, I have determined that the time,  skill, and capital would be worth the half  of this sum, thus leaving 500 pesos per month of profit," and judgment  was rendered  accordingly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In view of the decisions of the courts cited above, and of the language of section 84 of the Code of Civil Procedure, providing that the damages, in a case of this kind, shall be a reasonable compensation for the use and occupation  of the premises,  we  are  of opinion that the court  below adopted an  erroneous rule in ascertaining the amount  of damages in this case, and that the proof was not  sufficient to justify the conclusion of  the  court  or the judgment entered for damages.  Tlie judgment is therefore reversed and a  new trial ordered, with the costs to the  appellee. The  clerk will enter  judgment accordingly an&amp; remand the cast for further proceedings,  in  conformity  with this opinion, twenty days  from this date.</p>
