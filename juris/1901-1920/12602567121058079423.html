				<BR><STRONG>COOPER, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Bernardo Usis, Marcelino Mangubat, Aquilino Cantada, Luis Taganas, and Mateo 
Ronquillo are charged with the offense of bandolerismo and were convicted in the 
Court of First Instance of Cavite on the 28th day of August, 1903, as forming a 
party of bandits defined in Act No. 518 of the Civil Commission, and were 
condemned to the penalty of twenty years' imprisonment and to pay the costs of 
proceedings. The defendants have appealed to this court.
<p>From the testimony it appears that in the month of May, 1903, in the barrio 
of Iba, Silang, in the Province of Cavite, the accused were arrested by a body 
of Insular police; that at the time of their arrest they were in company with 
one Aguedo, and, meeting about a dozen of the Constabulary, Aguedo, who was 
called the chief of the gang, fired his revolver at the Constabulary and 
succeeded in making his escape; the defendants were captured and four of them were found armed with bolos and one with a Mauser bayonet.</p>
<p>According to the statement of witnesses on the part of the prosecution, upon 
their capture the defendants stated that they were in search of a carabao which 
had been lost, the property of one of their number, Mangubat, and that Aguedo 
was the chief of the band.</p>
<p>The defendants testified in their own behalf, some of them declaring that the 
lost carabao belonged to Marcelino Mangubat and others that the lost carabao was 
the property of Aquilino Cantada. Their statements were contradictory, both with 
respect to the places of their residence, the arms which they bore on that 
occasion, the manner in which they were assembled, and other minor details, 
which induced the court below, in connection with the other evidence, to believe 
that they formed a band of robbers and that they were guilty under the 
provisions of Act No. 518.</p>
<p>In order to sustain a conviction under the provisions of this Act, it must 
appear that the parties charged with the offense formed a band of robbers for 
the purpose of stealing carabaos or other personal property by the means of 
force and violence and went out upon the highway or roamed over the country 
armed with deadly weapons for this purpose.</p>
<p>To prove this crime it is unnecessary to adduce evidence that any member of 
the band has in fact committed robbery or theft, but it is sufficient to justify 
a conviction if from the circumstances it can be inferred beyond reasonable 
doubt that the accused was a member of such armed band as that described in the 
said act.</p>
<p>There is no proof in the case to show the purposes for which the band was 
organized or that any robbery or theft had been committed by the band. It is not 
necessary to make this proof by direct testimony. The purposes for which they 
Avere organized may be inferred from circumstances showing their purposes, but 
there must be something in the case from which the inference can properly be 
deduced (United States <em>vs.</em> Francisco Decusin, 1 Off. Gaz., 730;<span class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span>United States <em>vs.</em> Saturnino de la 
Cruz, 1 Off. Gaz., 664.<span class="style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span>)</p>
<p>On account of the insufficiency of proof in this respect the judgment of the 
Court of First Instance must be reversed and the defendants acquitted.</p>
<p>It is so ordered and directed and costs are adjudged <em>de oficio.</em></p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Mapa,</em> and <em>McDonough; JJ.,</em> concur.</p>

<p>I agree with Mr. Justice Cooper in his finding of facts and in his 
conclusions in this case of the United States <em>vs.</em> Usis et al.</p>
<p>In my opinion the doctrine announced by this court in the cause of the United 
States <em>vs.</em> Francisco Decusin has been overruled.<br></p>
