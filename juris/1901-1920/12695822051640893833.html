				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. A. A. ADDISON, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>TRENT, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The defendant A. A. Addison, having been condemned to pay a fine of P100, to 
indemnify the injured party in the sum of P500, with subsidiary imprisonment in 
case of insolvency, and to the payment of the costs of the cause, for a 
violation of the provisions of section 106 of General Orders No. 58, appealed to 
this court.
<p>On the 23d of December, 1912, the appellant subscribed and swore to an 
affidavit wherein he stated that on or about the 20th of that month at 8.30 a. 
m. he saw various bottles containing compounds of opium in an <em>aparador</em> 
situated in the upstairs <em>sala</em> of the house of John McStay in Lucena, 
Tayabas. On the same day the Court of First Instance issued a search warrant, 
based upon that affidavit, directing the sheriff to search the house of McStay 
and seize the opium. In compliance with this warrant the sheriff proceeded 
immediately to search the house, but found nothing of a contraband nature, and 
so reported to the court. Subsequent thereto, and on the 3d day of January, 
1913, John McStay filed a sworn complaint (denuncia), charging the appellant 
with the "crime of malicious prosecution" and alleging that the appellant did, 
on the 23d day of December, 1912, willfully and maliciously, with the sole 
intent and purpose of gratifying his personal resentment against the 
complainant, procure and obtain, without any probable cause whatever, a search 
warrant "of the person, residence, and place of business of the undersigned, by 
signing and swearing before the Honorable Herbert D. Gale, judge of the Court of 
First Instance, certain malicious, false, and defamatory statements, known to be 
false and defamatory by said accused." On the 11th of April, 1913, the 
provincial fiscal filed a formal complaint against the appellant charging him 
with the same crime and setting forth the same allegations as in the 
complainant's <em>denuncia</em>. After trial, the judgment above stated was duly 
entered.</p>
<p>For the purpose of showing that the search warrant was procured "maliciously 
and without probable cause," the prosecution presented seven witnesses, who 
testified substantially as follows:</p>
<p>Juan Merchan, clerk of the court, and Agapito Villa senor, sheriff, testified 
only in reference to the filing of the affidavit upon which the search warrant 
was based, the issuing of the warrant, and the search of the complainant's 
premises.</p>
<p>John McStay, the complainant, testified that for some time prior to the 23d 
of December, 1912, he was running a hotel and canteen in Lucena, Tayabas; that 
the appellant lived in his hotel from the 28th of September until the 23d of 
December; that pn the 23d of December the appellant left his hotel on account of 
certain disturbances which occurred therein on the previous night j that these 
disturbances were caused by three of four guests, and disturbed the appellant's 
sleep; that on the following day the appellant had a quarrel with one of these 
guests; that at the time he left he was angry and stated that he desired to 
leave the hotel and would arrange his account on the following day; that when he 
(the witness) bought the hotel he also bought the beds and the 
<em>aparadores;</em> and that he and the appellant were friends, never having 
had any trouble. As to the damages suffered by the complainant on account of the 
search of his premises, he stated that some persons did not know whether he was 
guilty or not, and, therefore, stayed away from his hotel during those days, 
resulting in damaging him in the sum of P500.</p>
<p>James R, Gittings testified that he was one of the persons who were making 
the noise in the hotel on the night of the 22d, while the appellant was sleeping 
upstairs; that the appellant called their attention to these disturbances and 
asked them to stop so that he could sleep; and that on the following day he and 
the appellant had a quarrel.</p>
<p>Thomas Hoey, an internal-revenue agent, testified that he accompained the 
sheriff at the time the complainant's hotel was searched; and that he induced 
the appellant to present the affidavit upon which the search warrant was based, 
after the appellant had stated to him that opium could be found in McStay's 
possession.</p>
<p>Guy B. Shiller, principal of the Lucena High School, testified that he had a 
conversation with the appellant and Hoey at the government building, and that he 
heard Hoey ask the appellant if the latter would make an affidavit for the 
purpose of securing the search warrant, and the appellant answered that he 
would.</p>
<p>Jose Nieva, an employee in the Bureau of Agriculture, stated that he was 
acquainted with Benigna Robles, a witness for the defendant; that on the 24th of 
December he returned to Lucena from Manila, and that when the train stopped at 
Calamba about 10 a. m., he saw Benigna Robles in the train.</p>
<p>The defense presented four witnesses; Joseph Rosemblatt, Charles R. Duffin, 
Benigna Robles, and the appellant.</p>
<p>Rosemblatt testified that he lived in Lucena up until some time in the month 
of August, 1912; that at that time a Mr. Salmon owned the canteen and hotel 
which was searched by the sheriff; that he was in an automobile accident when 
one of the passengers had his arm dislocated and, upon returning to Lucena after 
the accident, they went to the drug store to get some opium liniment; that the 
pharmacist refused to sell them this medicine without a doctor's prescription; 
that the following day he went to the canteen, which was located in the hotel, 
and was then informed by a Mr. Henson that the canteen had some 25 bottles of 
various kinds of medicines; that these bottles were shown him in an 
<em>aparador</em>; and that on taking hold of one of the bottles he discovered 
that it contained an opium mixture.</p>
<p>Duffin, who was a mechanical engineer at that time, stated that he knew the 
canteen owner, at the time the search warrant was issued, to be McStay; that 
when he first knew the hotel it was owned by one Henson; that at the time he 
left Lucena McStay was negotiating for the purchase of that hotel; that he saw 
in this hotel on various occasions opium in an <em>aparador</em>; and that this 
<em>aparador</em> was upstairs.</p>
<p>Benigna Robles testified that she was a dancing girl in McStay's saloon in 
December, 1912; that two days before Christmas she saw Hoey and McStay talking 
together in the hotel and heard Hoey use the word "Addison;" that after Hoey and 
McStay terminated their conversation, Henson entered the room upstairs and took 
out of the <em>aparador</em> some bottles and put them in his pocket; and that 
that same afternoon the search was made.</p>
<p>Section 106 of General Orders No. 58 reads: "Any person who shall procure a 
search warrant maliciously and without probable cause, and any officer who shall 
unlawfully exceed his authority or use unnecessary severity in executing the 
same, shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than one year or by a fine 
of not exceeding one thousand pesos, or by both such fine and imprisonment."</p>
<p>This section requires that both <em>malice</em> and absence of <em>probable 
cause</em> must exist concurrently in order to justify a conviction. If the 
appellant's act in making the affidavit was malicious and unfounded, but there 
was probable cause for such act, he must be acquitted. "In a legal sense' says 
Greenleaf (vol. 2, sec. 453, 16th. Ed.), "any unlawful act done willfully and 
purposely to the injury of another; is, as against that person, malicious.‚Äù 
Malice cannot be inferred from the fact that no opium was found in the house of 
the complainant by the sheriff.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Probable cause may be defined as such reasons, supported by facts and 
circumstances, as will warrant a cautious man in the belief that his action, and 
the means taken in prosecuting it, are legally just and proper." (Burton 
<em>vs.</em> St. Paul, M. &amp; M. Ry. Co., 33 Minn., 189.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Addison lived in McStay's hotel from September 28 to December 23, when he 
left on account of certain disturbances in the hotel on the night of the 22d.' 
McStay took no part in these disturbances. He and Addison were, according to his 
own testimony, friends. But it is said that the fact that Addison in effect 
charged McStay with the commission of a serious crime is inconsistent with the 
latter's testimony to the effect that they were friends. McStay said that they 
were friends, and he is the person who claims to have been injured. Again, 
Addison was induced by the internal-revenue agent to make the affidavit. In so 
doing he was carrying out his obligation as an "informer," and as such informer 
he had reasonable cause to believe that he would be rewarded therefor in 
accordance with certain provisions of the Opium Law.</p>
<p>Rosemblatt testified that he saw opium in the aparador before McStay bought 
the hotel. Duffin testified to the same effect and, also, that at the time he 
saw the opium McStay was negotiating for the purchase of the hoteL Benigna 
Robles said that she saw opium in the hotel two days before Christmas. She also 
testified in effect that McStay was notified of the issuance of a search warrant 
and caused the opium to be removed. The prosecution attempted to show that this 
witness was not in Lucena on the 23d of December, and for this purpose presented 
Jose Nieva, who testified that on his return to Lucena on the 24th he saw 
Benigna in the train at Calamba. It does not appear that Benigna could not have 
come to Manila on the afternoon or night of the 23d, or even on the morning of 
the 24th. We must, therefore, conclude that there was an absence of malice on 
the part of the defendant in making the affidavit and that there existed 
probable cause for making the affidavit.</p>
<p>For the foregoing reasons the judgment appealed from is reversed and the 
defendant acquitted, with costs <em>de officio.</em></p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Carson, Moreland,</em> and <em>Araullo, 
JJ.,</em> concur.<br></p></div>
