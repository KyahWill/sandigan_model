Jones is the same person who appeared as plaintiff in the case entitled Jones <i>vs.</i> Harding (9 Phil, Rep., 279), an application, for a similar writ, which was denied, and he was ordered to answer certain questions asked of him by the court, and which he had refused to answer. There being nothing to show that he had complied with the former order of the court and made answer to the questions, the writ was denied. The facts were identical as to the other petitioner. Judgment affirmed.<br><br>For petitioners: W.J. Rohde.<br>For opponents: Gibbs &amp; Gale.</div>
