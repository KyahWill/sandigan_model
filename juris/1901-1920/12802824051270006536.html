				<BR><BR><div align="justify">It&nbsp; appears that&nbsp; prior to&nbsp; the commencement of&nbsp; this prosecution the city of Manila, by its Municipal Board, had ordered to be torn down a number of houses whose location the health authorities of the&nbsp; city had declared to be unsanitary for the&nbsp; occupants,&nbsp; and the removal of said houses to the lands of the San Lazaro Estate, there to be reconstructed.&nbsp; In consideration&nbsp; of its act of enforced removal of&nbsp; said houses&nbsp; the city&nbsp; agreed with the owners thereof that it would furnish and pay&nbsp; the workmen&nbsp; required for the tearing down, removal, and reconstruction of said houses and would furnish and pay for all new materials used in such&nbsp; reconstruction.&nbsp;&nbsp; To carry out this order and agreement the city&nbsp; issued to&nbsp; each owner of a house so to be torn down and removed&nbsp; a certificate or permit containing the name of the owner, a&nbsp; description of the house,&nbsp; and the agreement to remove and reconstruct gratis.&nbsp; Among the certificates, or permits,&nbsp; or agreements, was one issued to Severino&nbsp; Pelagio, dated&nbsp; January 18, 1909.&nbsp; About the time&nbsp; that the&nbsp; house&nbsp; was to&nbsp; be torn&nbsp; down and removed to San Lazaro, Severino sold&nbsp; and transferred&nbsp; said house, together with all&nbsp; of&nbsp; his&nbsp; rights under said&nbsp; certificate or agreement, to the wife of the accused in this case, <span style="font-style: italic;">including the right to&nbsp; have&nbsp; the house rebuilt at the expense of the city.&nbsp;</span> The instrument of transfer bears date the 12th of March, 1909.&nbsp; In rebuilding the said houses, the city hired the carpenters and the time they worked was kept daily by the accused, who was&nbsp; their foreman.&nbsp; Among the carpenters so hired by the city was one, Segundo Castro, who was engaged in rebuilding the&nbsp; house&nbsp; formerly&nbsp; owned&nbsp; by said Severino&nbsp; Pelagio&nbsp; and&nbsp; transferred&nbsp; to&nbsp; the accused. Castro worked in the reconstruction of this house from the 15th of April to the 23d of April, inclusive.&nbsp; The charge against the accused is that he reported&nbsp; Castro&nbsp; upon his time book as working for the city when in reality he was working for the accused, and that&nbsp; he thereby sought to defraud the city of the sum which it would have paid for such labor.<br><br>The accused was charged in the Court of First Instance of Manila with the crime of falsification of a public document by a public official,&nbsp; was&nbsp; duly tried thereon, convicted and sentenced to twelve years and&nbsp; one day of <i>cadena temporal</i>&nbsp; He appealed.<br><br>It appears from "the facts as detailed above that there was an entire absence of criminal intent on the part of the accused.&nbsp; If the right of Severino Pelagio to have his house rebuilt at the expense of the city, both as to workmen and materials, was a&nbsp; transferable right, a question we do not here decide, then that right passed to the&nbsp; accused. Whether&nbsp; or&nbsp; not&nbsp; that&nbsp; right&nbsp; passed&nbsp; by the&nbsp; transfer,&nbsp; the accused evidently believed it did and acted upon that belief without attempt at concealment or evasion.&nbsp; Accordingly, believing that the city was in duty bound to rebuild the house which his wife had purchased of Severino, he saw no more harm or wrong&nbsp; in charging against the&nbsp; city the time spent by the carpenter Castro in rebuilding it than in charging against the city the time&nbsp; spent by other carpenters who were rebuilding the other houses that had been removed under exactly the same circumstances.<br><br>While the methods pursued by the defendant are subject to criticism and were very properly objected to by the city, we are of the opinion&nbsp; that he should be&nbsp; dealt with civilly or administratively rather than criminally.<br><br>The judgment&nbsp; of the&nbsp; court below&nbsp; is&nbsp; hereby&nbsp; reversed, the defendant acquitted&nbsp; and his discharge from custody ordered;&nbsp; costs <i>de oficio</i>.<br><br><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Johnson, </i>and <i>Carson, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
