				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This was an action for the crime of giving false testimony.

plaintiff, <em>vs</em>. Claro Magcauas, defendant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>" 'The plaintiff appears and as a cause of action against the defendant, alleges:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>" ' I. That the plaintiff is the plain and absolute
owner of a great extension of land commonly known by the name of
Hacienda of Pasay, situated partly in Malate and Singalong, in the

<blockquote>
  <p>"All these statements are absolutely false, and are
essential to the case at issue wherein they were made, because really
and truly the accused had heard about the Pasay estate prior to the
four last years, and he well knew that at that time there were brought
in the justice of the peace court at Pineda when he was filling that
office many actions for forcible entry and detainer, instituted by
Agustin J. Montilla against tenants of the estate, he having received
an order from the Court of First Instance asking for a list of said
actions, with a statement of the actions for forcible entry and
detainer and the answers filed by the defendants, and the accused
himself signed three lists which he forwarded to the Court of First
Instance; because the accused himself received an order from the Court
of First Instance enjoining him to notify all the tenants of the Pasay
estate of the decision rendered in favor of Don Agustin J. Montilla, in
the suit brought by fyim against the Augustinian Friars, and the
accused himself having rendered an order wherein the proper action was
taken for the compliance with such order of the Court of First
Instance, and the accused himself having taken part in various other
proceedings had for the purpose of complying with such orders from the
Court of First Instance; because the accused knew that Don Agustin
Montilla was the administrator of the Pasay estate, and was substituted
by reason of the suit by him brought against the Augustinian Friars by
the curate of the pueblo, Father Benito Ibanez, and he, the accused,
likewise knew that Father Martin Arconada, the procurator of the
convent of the Augustinian Fathers, did intervene in the management of
the Pasay estate, and because he, the accused, likewise knew that in
the years 1895 and 1898 there was brought by the Augustinian Friars
against Mr. Montilla an action for forcible entry and detainer of the
Pasay estate, the result of which was that said Mr. Montilla, together
with many other tenants of the Pasay estate, were ousted; all contrary
to the form of the statute in such cases made and provided."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This complaint was duly signed and sworn to. At the close of the
trial in the inferior court the defendant was found guilty of the crime
charged in the said complaint and was sentenced to be imprisoned for a
period of three months of <em>arresto mayor</em>, with the accessories
of article 61 of the Penal Code and to pay a fine of 1,500 pesetas or
to suffer, in case of insolvency, the corresponding subsidiary
imprisonment, which should not exceed one-third part of the period of
imprisonment imposed, and to pay the costs.</p>
<p>From this sentence the defendant appealed to this court. It is
admitted that the defendant gave the testimony set out in the
complaint, during the trial of a civil case in the court of a justice
of the peace of the city of Manila, between Edwin H. Warner, plaintiff,
and Claro Magcauas, defendant, an action brought by the plaintiff to
recover of the defendant the annual rent for a certain tract of land
for the years 1899, 1900, 1901, 1902, and 1903. The defendant was
summoned as a witness to appear before said justice of the peace, to
give testimony upon the trial of this cause.</p>
<p>It is difficult to ascertain from an examination of the alleged
false testimony set out in the said complaint just how the questions
and answers in said false testimony have any bearing whatever upon the
issue that was being tried before said justice of the peace. Admitting,
however, that they must have had some reference to some question
presented before the court, we proceed to an examination of the
question whether such testimony was false.</p>
<p>Chapter VI of Title IV of the Penal Code provides the punishment for
false testimony in both criminal and civil cases, but this chapter
makes no attempt to define false testimony or in any way to indicate of
what false testimony consists.</p>
<p>Escriche in his valuable dictionary (p. 972) defines false testimony
to be: "La impostura o acusacion contra un inocente y la deposicion que
hace un testigo contra la verdad."</p>
<p><em>"Falso testimonio" </em>under Spanish law corresponds to "<em>false swearing</em>"
under English law. False swearing, under the English law, is committed
by a person who swears falsely before any person authorized to
administer an oath upon a matter of public concern, under such
circumstances that the false swearing would have amounted to perjury if
committed in a judicial proceeding.</p>
<p>Bishop in his work on criminal law (Vol. 2, p. 588) says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"False swearing is the name given in the statutes of
some of the States to false declarations on oath which, while not
within any common law or statutory designation of perjury, are, by such
statutes, rendered otherwise indictable."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Article 321 of the Penal Code provides that—</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"False testimony given in a civil cause shall be punished with a penalty of <em>arresto mayor</em> in its maximum degree to <em>presidio correccional</em> in its medium degree and a fine of from 625 to 6,250 pesetas.</p>
  <p>"If the amount of the claim should not exceed 625 pesetas, the penalties shall be those of <em>arresto mayor</em> and a fine of from 325 to 3,250 pesetas."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This testimony was given in a civil cause and it was the duty of the
Government to prove that it was falae. Not only was it the duty of the
Government to show that the testimony was false but that it was given
knowing that it was false and with malicious intent. Viada, in his
valuable Commentaries on the Penal Code (vol. 2, p. 449, 4th ed.), says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Comete el delito de falso testimonio todo el que
falta maliciosamente a la verdad en sus declaraciones, sea negandola,
sea diciendo lo contrario a ella."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During the examination of the defendant as a witness in the cause in
which it is alleged he gave false testimony he was asked certain
questions with reference to the existence of certain facts. His answers
invariably were that he did not remember, or that he had no
recollection concerning those facts. The prosecuting attorney proved
the existence of the facts with reference to which the defendant was
questioned, but failed to prove that the statements of the defendant
with reference to those facts were false. The mere fact that the
defendant had had to do in the year 1896 with certain facts and
relations was not sufficient to prove that he stated a falsehood when
he stated in December, 1904, that he had <em>"no recollection with reference to such facts or relations."</em>
The evidence adduced during the trial fails, in our judgment, to show
that the defendant testified falsely or gave false testimony as was
charged in the complaint.</p>
<p>In order that a defendant may be convicted under article 321 of the
Penal Code for giving false testimony, the following facts must be
shown:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>First. The testimony must be given in a civil cause.</p>
  <p>Second. The testimony must relate to the issues presented in said cause.</p>
  <p>Third. The testimony must be false.</p>
  <p>Fourth. The false testimony must be given by the defendant knowing the same to be false.</p>
  <p>Fifth. Such testimony must be malicious and given with an intent to affect the issues presented in said cause.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The evidence adduced during the trial of this case is not sufficient
to show that the defendant committed the crime charged in the complaint.
The judgment of the inferior court is therefore reversed and the said
cause is hereby ordered to be dismissed.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Mapa, Carson</em>, and <em>Willard, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
