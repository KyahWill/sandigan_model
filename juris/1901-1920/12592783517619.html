				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE, VS. JUAN LUNA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.

				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> This case was prosecuted in the Court of First Instance of  Manila  against  Juan Luna for attempted abduction, and was brought before us  by an appeal  taken by the defendant against the judgment of the 12th of March last, by which he was condemned to  one year eight months and twenty days of prision correctional, with accessories, and to the payment of costs.  While  the appeal was pending in this court the attorney  for  the appellant, by petition dated the 17th of May last, presented to the court a public instrument dated the 15th  of the same month,  by which, with the consent of the defendant, Tomasa Rivera y Felipe, a widow, who states that she is the mother of  the minor Juana Isidro y Rivera, 12 years of age, the alleged victim of  the crime prosecuted, granted an express pardon  of the offense committed, as the representative of her said daughter, in favor of the defendant, Juan Luna, remitting the penalty to  which  he may have  become liable, this pardon having been granted generously, without consideration of recompense and without coercion.   The attorney for the defendant moved the court to declare that the penal  action brought  by the  complaining witness was extinguished, and asked that the bail bond given by the defendant be canceled.</p>
<p> This case deals with an offense in which  the penal action or liability to  the penalty fixed  for its punishment may be extinguished by the express or implied  pardon of the party offended, in accordance with the last paragraph of article 448 of the Penal Code.</p>
<p> The motion of the counsel for the  defendant is based upon an express pardon, recorded in a public instrument, by the mother of the injured party, who, being a widow, exercises  over  the  complaining  witness  the rights  of parental authority.  The Solicitor-General opposes this motion on the ground that the pardon was not granted by the injured party herself, as is expressly required by the Penal Code.</p>
<p> In view of the clear and precise terms  in  which paragraph 4 of article  448 is drawn, there can  not be the slightest doubt that the express pardon for  the offense must be granted  by the injured party, and in case the injured party should be a minor, or should lack the necessary capacity to maintain an action,  then, in order that the .pardon have its effect, it is necessary that this defect be cured by the completion of this deficient personality. In the third paragraph of article 448 it is provided that if the injured party,  by reason of nonage or moral condition,  should be without capacity to sue,  and  should  be so unprotected  as to be without parents,  grandparents, brothers, tutor, or curator, then the fiscal may denounce the crime.  It appears, therefore, that the right to prosecute the crime or  to appear in the action is attributed  in the first place to the person aggrieved, and, in the event of such person being unable to do so by reason of lack  of personality, then  the law designated in successive order the persons upon  whom devolves the duty of prosecuting the crime.</p>
<p> Correlative to this precept,  the following  paragraph establishes the right, conferred by the law upon the injured party, to grant a pardon.  In order that the pardon produce its effects it must be made by  the person injured, or, in case  that person  be a minor, then the parents or guardian of such  person must take part in the granting thereof.  But the  granting of pardon by these persons alone, in the name or on behalf of the minor, is not sufficient, because,  as  the offense essentially  and directly affects the injured party, she alone is entitled to remit the offense and to authorize the extinction of the penal action. This pardon can only be presumed in the case of the marriage of the injured party with the offender, and can not be presumed from any act on the part of her. representatives.</p>
<p> The best  confirmatory demonstration of the doctrine that it is absolutely necessary and indispensable that the pardon be granted by the victim of the attempt herself is a decision  of the  supreme court of Spain  of the  5th  of January, 1898, applying the precept of section 4 of article 448 of the Penal Code,  to the effect  that  a marriage entered into by a girl under age, although illegal because of lack of consent of the parents,  is sufficient to produce the  extinction of  the  penal action and of the penalty, because, by the celebration of this marriage, the pardon of the offense is presumed, and the crime is blotted  out by the  marriage of the injured party to the offender.  Consequently, as it  has not  been made to appear that the offended party, Juana  Isidro,  has  expressly pardoned the injury alleged to have been done  her  by the defendant Juan Luna, and the pardon of the girPs  mother not being sufficient to authorize the dismissal of the case in accordance with the provisions of the Penal Code,  we are of the opinion that the contention of  the attorney for the defendant  can not be  sustained, and therefore the motion  is overruled, with the costs, and the prosecution of this case in the second instance will be continued.  So ordered.</p>
