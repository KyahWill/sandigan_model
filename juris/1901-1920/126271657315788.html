				<H3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. JAMES W. WALSH, JR., DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>TRACEY, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The defendant  was charged  under  article 390 of the Penal Code with embezzlement of public property to the amount of P7,000, Philippine currency, which had come into his  hands as Constabulary supply officer.  He was convicted in the Court of First Instance of Masbate of the misappropriation of commissary stores and quartermaster supplies  of  the value of P4,055.36, Philippine currency, and sentenced to imprisonment  (<em>prision mayor</em>)  for ten years, with costs.  The evidence fully supports the conclusions of the trial judge as to the misappropriation of the property, its character, and value.</p>
<p>On the preceding day, in the same court, the defendant had been tried and convicted and was, on the date of the trial therein, sentenced to ten years of <em>presidio mayor</em> for the embezzlement of Government funds while holding office as such supply officer.   The dates covered by both charges and the witnesses heard were the same;  both complaints were made under the  same article of the code, the only difference being that in the first case  the property was specified to be money and in the seconds tores and supplies.</p>
<p>We are of opinion that in these two cases but one crime was charged, for which he  could not be twice put in jeopardy.  The offense under article 390 can not be divided into as many crimes as there are public articles or classes of articles unaccounted for by the accused official.   In this respect it differs from successive thefts of distinct articles. The defendant has been already tried and punished for this crime.  He asserted  this defense in the only way at that time available, in objecting to testimony and in his motion for a new trial, based upon  copies of the complaint and sentence in the first case.</p>
<p>This judgment proceeds solely upon the ground that the defendant  has already  been  tried and  convicted of  this offense.</p>
<p>The  judgment of the lower court is  reversed and the accused is ordered discharged at the expiration of the term of his  first sentence, but without  prejudice to any right that the Government may have to proceed civilly against him or his sureties, with costs <em>de oficio.</em></p>
<p>At the expiration  of ten days judgment should be entered in  accordance  with this decision  and the case  remanded to the court below for execution of said judgment. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa,</em> and <em>Willard, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
