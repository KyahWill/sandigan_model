<p class="BODY">This case involves a parcel of land situated in Barrio San 
Vicente, San Pedro, Laguna, containing an area of 3.46 hectares, more or 
less.<span>&nbsp; </span>The lot was part of the estate, known as the Laguna 
Settlement Project, belonging to the Republic of the 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>, 
originally purchased and administered by the National Resettlement and 
Rehabilitation Administration (NARRA) for disposal to landless tenants and farm 
workers pursuant to Republic Act No. 1160.<span>&nbsp; </span>With the abolition of 
NARRA, the administration of the Laguna Settlement Project was vested in the 
Land Authority created under <span>Republic Act No. 3844, and subsequently, 
transferred to the Department of Agrarian Reform.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Renato</span> <span class="SpellE">Tipon</span> acquired the lot in question (Lot No. 386 of the 
Laguna Settlement Project) from the government by virtue of a Deed of Sale 
executed in his favor by the Department of Agrarian Reform on <st1:date month="11" day="23" year="1976">November 23, 1976</st1:date>, for the price of 
P1,251.20.<span>&nbsp; </span>Among the conditions stated in the Deed of Sale were 
the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="2Q">"1.<span>&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></p>
<p>2. That from the date of the pertinent Order of Award and within TEN 
(10) years from the date of issuance by the proper Register of Deeds of the 
certificate of title, the land subject hereof shall not, except by hereditary 
succession, be subdivided, sold or in any manner transferred or encumbered 
except in<b> </b>favor of any of the <span class="SpellE">VENDEE's</span> relative 
within the third civil degree by consanguinity or affinity who fulfill the four 
(4) requirements in section 6, Land Authority Administrative Order No. 4, series 
of 1967, or in favor of the Government and its financial or banking institution 
or rural banks, and only upon prior written consent of the Secretary of the 
Department of Agrarian Reform; and any said transfer, encumbrance or alienation 
made in violation hereof shall be null and void; provided, that in case of 
foreclosure of mortgage on the lot, only qualified landless <em>bona-fide</em> 
farmers in the municipality where the land subject of foreclosure lies, may 
participate in the bidding, and in their absence, the mortgagee shall be allowed 
to bid but may not thereafter sell the land without prior written permission 
from the Secretary of the department of AGRARIAN REFORM, further, that any sale, 
transfer or alienation made by the herein VENDEE as authorized in this paragraph 
shall be subject to the right of repurchase by him or by his legal heirs within 
a period of five (5) years from the date of such sale, transfer or 
alienation.</p>
<p>3. That the violation of the next preceding paragraph shall be sufficient 
ground for the forfeiture of all payments made on account of the purchase price 
hereof without prejudice to the right of the VENDOR to demand full settlement by 
the VENDEE of the loan or loans, if any, extended to him by the VENDOR and/or 
defunct NARRA; and the prosecution by the VENDOR of the proper certification in 
court for the cancellation of this DEED OF SALE or the certificate of title that 
may hereafter be issued in favor of the VENDEE and/or his successor-in-interest 
and the reversion of the land and improvements thereon to the 
government."</p></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">On the day the Deed of Sale was executed in his favor, <span class="SpellE">Tipon</span> filed a request with the Department of Agrarian Reform 
for permission to transfer his rights and interest over the lot in question in 
favor of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Umiral</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Matic</span> (respondent herein).<span>&nbsp; </span>This request was 
granted by the Regional Director of Region IV of the Department of Agrarian 
Reform on <st1:date month="12" day="9" year="1976">December 9, 1976</st1:date> 
"subject to <span>the </span>condition that the Deed of Transfer is submitted to 
this department for verification and final approval."</p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="12" day="10" year="1976">December 10, 
1976</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Tipon</span> submitted the Deed of Absolute 
Sale in favor of <span class="SpellE">Matic</span> for approval and, on the same 
day, it was approved by the Regional Director of Region IV of the Department of 
Agrarian Reform.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Matic</span> 
caused the titling of the property in the name of <span class="SpellE">Tipon</span> to whom was issued Transfer Certificate of Title No. 
50617, and later, had the same transferred to his name under Transfer 
Certificate of Title No. 53850 dated <st1:date month="7" day="12" year="1977">July 12, 1977</st1:date>, of the Registry of Deeds for the 
<st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype> of 
<st1:placename>Laguna</st1:placename></st1:place>.</p>
<p class="BODY">However, in a letter dated March 8, 1977 addressed to the Regional 
Director of Region IV, Department of Agrarian Reform, <span class="SpellE">Tipon</span> sought the cancellation and nullification of the 
transfer he had made of his rights over the lot in question to respondent <span class="SpellE">Matic</span>, and requested at the same time that he be granted 
permission to transfer his rights therein to one <span class="SpellE">Calixto</span> <span class="SpellE">Cataquiz</span>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>This letter was followed by the actual filing of a formal complaint by 
<span class="SpellE">Tipon</span> against <span class="SpellE">Matic</span> with the 
Department of Agrarian Reform, seeking the annulment of the Deed of Sale in 
favor of <span class="SpellE">Matic</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>This complaint was 
subsequently dismissed on the motion of <span class="SpellE">Tipon</span>, who, at 
the same time, executed a "release, waiver and quit claim" of any and all 
rights, title and interest he has over the lot in question in favor of <span class="SpellE">Matic</span>.</p>
<p class="BODY">Later, however, in a letter dated June 15, 1977, <span class="SpellE">Tipon</span>, through counsel, made a demand on <span class="SpellE">Matic</span> to either pay him the sum of P86,612.50 representing 
50% of the sum of P173,225.00 which he alleged to be the true consideration of 
the sale of the lot in question per their verbal agreement, or to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span> to him the said lot for the amount of P20,000.00, 
the consideration appearing in the Deed of Absolute Sale, dated December 10, 
1976.</p>
<p class="BODY">As respondent <span class="SpellE">Matic</span> chose to ignore the 
demand, the petitioner filed a complaint with the Court of First Instance of 
Laguna (Civil Case No. B-1317) seeking to compel the defendant <span class="SpellE">Matic</span> to allow him to redeem or repurchase the parcel of 
land in<span> question, invoking the provisions of Section 8 of Administrative 
Order No. 4, Series of 1967, which gives the vendor or <span class="SpellE">transferror</span> the right to do so within a period of five (5) 
years from date of sale, transfer or alienation, a right which was embodied in 
the Deed of Sale executed by the Department of Agrarian Reform in his favor 
annotated in the corresponding certificate of title.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">After trial, the lower court dismissed the complaint and ordered 
the plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Tipon</span> to reimburse the defendant <span class="SpellE">Matic</span> the sum of P7,561.55 by<span> way of attorney's fees 
and to pay the costs of the proceedings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Tipon</span> appealed the said decision to the 
then Court of Appeals, but the latter, in a decision dated <st1:date month="5" day="8" year="1985">May 8, 1985</st1:date>, affirmed the appealed decision 
<u><em>en</em></u> <span class="SpellE"><em><u>toto</u></em></span>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Hence, this petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>.</p>
<p class="BODY">The petition should be given due course.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, in 
disposing of this case, the Court is not limited to the narrow issues raised in 
the petition.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>It is abundantly clear from the evidence presented to the 
Court <em>a</em> </span><em>quo</em><span> that the parties in this case have 
flouted the law.<span>&nbsp; </span>The land in question was part of a landed estate 
acquired by the government for distribution to landless tenants and 
</span>farmers.<span>&nbsp; </span>The petitioner was awarded the lot in question, 
being purportedly deserving and qualified to acquire the same.<span>&nbsp; </span>In 
awarding lands pursuant to <span>laws intended to alleviate the plight of the 
land</span>less, the state normally imposes certain conditions and restrictions 
designed to prevent practices that would defeat the beneficent purpose of the 
law.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thus, in this case, the deed of sale in favor of the 
petitioner (vendee) embodied a clause explicitly prohibiting him from selling, 
transferring and <span class="SpellE">encumberring</span> the property granted to 
him within ten years from the issuance of the certificate of title, "except in 
favor of any of the vendee's relatives within the third civil degree by 
consanguinity or affinity who fulfill the four (4) requirements in Section 6, 
Land Authority Administrative Order No. 4, Series of 1967, or in favor of the 
government and its financial or banking institution or rural banks . . ." 
Another clause (paragraph 3) of the deed of sale provides that any violation of 
the conditions shall be a ground for the cancellation of the deed of sale or 
certificate of title that may be issued in favor of the vendee and his 
successor-in-interest, and the reversion of the land and improvements thereon to 
the government.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>On the very same day (</span><st1:date month="11" day="23" year="1976"><span>November 23, 1976</span></st1:date><span>) that the petitioner 
acquired the property from the government, the petitioner turned around and 
asked permission from the Department of Agrarian Reform </span>to sell the same 
to respondent <span class="SpellE">Matic</span> in violation of the conditions to 
which the grant was subject.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Inspite</span> of 
the clause restricting the transferability of the land, the request was approved 
by the Regional Director of Region IV of the Department of Agrarian Reform on 
<st1:date month="12" day="9" year="1976">December 9, 1976</st1:date>, and on the 
next day, the petitioner executed the corresponding deed of sale in favor of the 
respondent for the stated consideration of P20,000.00.<span>&nbsp; </span>The deed of 
sale was approved <span>by the Regional Director on the same 
day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>It is difficult to understand why the courts which have 
dealt with this case failed to note how </span>the parties so flagrantly 
violated and disregarded the conditions imposed on the grant of the land to 
petitioner, defeating with impunity the very objective sought to be accomplished 
by the government in its program of giving land to the landless.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>There is hardly any doubt from the evidence on record that the petitioner 
had no intention at all of keeping for himself and utilizing the land which he 
acquired from the government, for even while the ink on the deed of sale in his 
favor was still wet, so to speak, he already took steps to transfer the land to 
the respondent.<span>&nbsp; </span>His indecent haste in disposing of the land, 
followed by his despicable attempts to make an exorbitant profit from the 
transaction only shows that he was unduly taking advantage of the land 
distribution program of the government and was interested only in making a 
killing for himself rather than in gratefully <span>accepting the land from the 
government to </span>improve his lot in life and provide for himself and his 
family a brighter future.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Court is not unaware of the practice 
of some intended beneficiaries of the land distribution programs of the 
government who are more interested in reselling the land and making a quick 
profit from it.<span>&nbsp; </span>We cannot close our eyes to this deplorable 
practice.<span>&nbsp; </span>We should not allow either party in the present case to 
reap any benefit from the illegal transaction and make a mockery of the 
government's laudable program of providing land to the landless and shelter to 
the homeless citizens of our country.</p>
<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, judgment is rendered denying the <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span> prayed for by the petitioner and dismissing the
