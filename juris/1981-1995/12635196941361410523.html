				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The case before us on automatic review of a judgment sentencing
the appellant to death is an uncommon one.</p>

<p class="BODY">The killing of a prominent lawyer which led to the murder charge
took place in 1944 during the Japanese occupation. The original information was
filed in 1947. The accused were arrested in 1950. During the preliminary
investigation of the three accused in 1951, the appellant and one co-accused
jumped bail and disappeared. The third co-accused was tried in 1959, almost
nine years later. He implicated his two missing co-accused, was found guilty,
and was sentenced to life imprisonment. He has since been released on parole.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile in 1969 or eighteen (18) years after he jumped bail,
the appellant was arrested. He was charged in <span class="GramE">an amended</span>
information, tried, and sentenced to DEATH.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a thorough review of the evidence on record, we are
convinced that the accused-appellant <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was
</span>at the scene of the crime during its commission and that, contrary to
his protestations, he had something to do with the killing. However, because of
unavoidable difficulties or unfortunate lapses on the part of the prosecution,
the only evidence directly incriminating the appellant – the confession of the
co-accused convicted earlier – happens to be inadmissible against him. We are,
therefore, constrained to acquit the accused-appellant and write finis to the
39-year old killing, not because the appellant had nothing to do with the crime
but because the evidence adduced subsequent to his recapture 25 years after the
crime, fails to overcome the cons­titutional presumption of innocence that an
accused enjoys. The appellant is now more than 70 years old. If the letters to
the Court interceding for his re­lease are to be believed, the appellant has
led an exemplary life during his incarceration in the national penitentiary.</p>

<p class="BODY">The original information for murder was filed on <st1:date year="1947" day="25" month="1">January 25, 1947</st1:date> against six (6)
accused persons. The information reads:</p>

<blockquote>"The undersigned Provincial Fiscal hereby accuses <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span> de la Cruz, <span class="SpellE">Ladislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Tayo</span>, Tomas <span class="SpellE">Tating</span>, Francisco <span class="SpellE">Tapar</span>, <span class="SpellE">Eriberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Eufemia</span> <span class="SpellE">Litong</span> of the crime of Murder, <span class="SpellE">commited</span>
as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That on or about April 10, 1944, in the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Viga</span>, province of <span class="SpellE">Catanduanes</span>,
Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said
accused, conspiring together and help­ing each other, with evident
premeditation and with the decided purpose to kill, did then and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlawfully and feloniously, assault and attack
Pedro <span class="SpellE">Sorreta</span> by beating him to death with blunt
instruments, and by throwing afterwards his corpse into the sea.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">"In the commission of
the crime there was present the aggravating cir­cumstance of superior
strength."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">During the preliminary examination, no probable cause was found
against <span class="SpellE">Eufemia</span> <span class="SpellE">Litong</span>. This
led to the dismissal of the case against her. The case was also dismissed with
respect to Tomas <span class="SpellE">Tating</span> on the ground that his
testimony was absolutely necessary for the prosecution. With the finding that
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Tapar</span> had nothing to do with the commission
of the <span class="GramE">crime,</span> the case was likewise dismissed as to
him.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The three remaining
accused, namely </span>–<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span> de la Cruz, <span class="SpellE">Ladislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Tayo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Eriberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span> 0were arrested on November 29, 1950. Of the three,
only <span class="SpellE">Eriberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span>
remained in the custody of the author­ities as the other two posted bail and
were subse­quently released.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The preliminary investigation proper was set on <st1:date year="1951" day="2" month="2">February 2, 1951</st1:date>. <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span>
de la Cruz and <span class="SpellE">Ladislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Tayo</span>
failed to appear during the investigation. A motion for their arrest and the
confiscation of their bail bonds was filed and duly granted by the Justice of
the Peace.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case was returned to the Court of First Instance for further
proceedings because <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span> de la Cruz and <span class="SpellE">Ladislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Tayo</span> could not be
apprehended while <span class="SpellE">Eriberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span>
had waived his right to preliminary investigation proper and the Justice of the
Peace was of the opinion that the two other accused had also waived their right
by their continued failure to appear.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">At the separate trial
conducted for <span class="SpellE">Eriberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span>
in 1959 or almost 9 years later, he was found guilty and sentenced to life
imprisonment. No appeal having been filed, <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span>
commenced serving sentence and during the trial of the appellant was already
out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Because of the failure to apprehend <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span>
de la Cruz and <span class="SpellE">Ladislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Tayo</span>,
the trial court directed that the case be sent to the files without prejudice
to its subsequent prosecution when the accused or either of them <span class="GramE">were</span> apprehended.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 16, 1968 or almost 10 years after the case was archived
and 25 years after the killing, the trial court issued a new order of arrest
for both the accused on the information that they were seen somewhere in the
province of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>. <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">de la Cruz was subsequently arrested on
September, 1969. As to <span class="SpellE">Ladislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Tayo</span>,
he has remained at large.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After the arrest of <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span> de la Cruz,
<span class="GramE">an amended</span> information was filed against him on <st1:date year="1970" day="12" month="5">May 12, 1970</st1:date>. The amended information
reads:</p>

<blockquote>"The victim, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Sorreta</span>, was a <span class="SpellE">practising</span> attorney and formerly a member of the Provincial
Board of <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>. In 1944, during the Japanese
occupation, he lived with his family in the barrio of <span class="SpellE">Tinago</span>
of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Viga</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, <span class="SpellE">Catanduanes</span>.

years old. His wife, Carmen, had just given birth to a child a few days before.
The case was actively prosecuted by <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span> <span class="SpellE">Sorreta</span> in collaboration with the Second Assistant
Provincial Fiscal.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The substance of the testimony of mother and son shows that
in the afternoon of <st1:date year="1944" day="10" month="4">April 10, 1944</st1:date>,
they were in their house in <span class="SpellE">Tinago</span>, <span class="SpellE">Viga</span>, when Francisco <span class="SpellE">Tapar</span> came
up the house. He had come to consult Atty. Pedro <span class="SpellE">Sorreta</span>
about the wife of <span class="SpellE">Ladislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Tayo</span>.
It seemed that the wife had become unfaithful to her husband while he was out of
<span class="SpellE">Catanduanes</span> but the paramour had been killed recently
and <span class="SpellE">Tapar</span> was asking Atty. <span class="SpellE">Sorreta's</span>
<span class="GramE">advise</span> as to whether <span class="SpellE">Ladislao</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tayo</span> and his wife should <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">be reconciled. Atty. <span class="SpellE">Sorreta</span> advised that
since they were husband and wife they should live together again. While they
were talking there were three men who could be seen through the window </span>at
some distance from the house. Atty. <span class="SpellE">Sorreta</span> inquired
from <span class="SpellE">Tapar</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">who
</span>they were and <span class="SpellE">Tapar</span> answered that they were
the men who killed the paramour of the wife of <span class="SpellE">Ladislao</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tayo</span> in the barrio of <span class="SpellE">Guinsaanan</span>.
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Sorreta</span> asked <span class="SpellE">Tapar</span>
about their names and <span class="SpellE">Tapar</span> identified them as <span class="SpellE">Ladislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Tayo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Eriberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span> de la Cruz. Then <span class="SpellE">Tapar</span>
casually asked Atty. <span class="SpellE">Sorreta</span> where he was going that
afternoon and Atty. <span class="SpellE">Sorreta</span> said that he was going to
the sea to fish. <span class="SpellE">Tapar</span> then asked permission to leave
and Atty. <span class="SpellE">Sorreta</span> prepared to go out on his fishing
trip. Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Sorreta</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span>
saw <span class="SpellE">Tapar</span> go with the three men when he left.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"According to <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span>, his father
loved to fish in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Tinago</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Bay</st1:placetype></st1:place> in the afternoon on clear days
and usually came back at night. On <st1:date year="1944" day="10" month="4">April
 10, 1944</st1:date>, after he saw him off at the seashore he never returned. They
waited for him until morning. At about nine to ten o'clock when he had not yet
returned he sent their houseboy to the <span class="SpellE">sitio</span> of <span class="SpellE">Minaabat</span> to look for him in the farm but he was not there. They
searched the beach and found the boat afloat <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">about fifty meters from the </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">beach</span></st1:placetype><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> of </span><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Lusadan</span></span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> near the opening of </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Tinago</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Bay</st1:placetype></st1:place>.
They reported the matter to Barrio Lt. <span class="SpellE">Ugalde</span> and
Councilor Tomas <span class="SpellE">Tating</span> who promised to help. They
continued the search with <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> de Leon until April 12
but Atty. <span class="SpellE">Sorreta</span> could not be found. At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">eight o'clock</st1:time> in the morning of April 13,
Ignacio Ted, a resident of <span class="SpellE">Lusadan</span> came to their
house and informed them that his father's body was seen being dashed by the
waves to the beach in <span class="SpellE">Lusadan</span>. The infor­mation was
relayed to the barrio lieutenant and they went to the place and found Atty. <span class="SpellE">Sorreta</span> dead. <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span> noted that
his nape was black. When his body was turned upward he saw his teeth shattered
and the chin swollen. There was <span class="SpellE">hematoma</span> on the right
forehead and breast. The body was in a state of decomposition. Because of his
condition <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span> agreed to have it brought to <span class="SpellE">Tinago</span> for speedy burial. It was taken to <span class="SpellE">Tinago</span> by a boat to the house of a relative, <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> de Leon, and was buried in the cemetery in the barrio. <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span> and his sister Elisa attended the burial. Their
mother could not attend because she had just delivered a child on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the seventh. Because of the condi­tion of the
times no death certificate was issued then.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"After the burial a novena was held in the house of the
deceased every night. On the third night the three men, <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span>
de la Cruz, <span class="SpellE">Ladislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Tayo</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Eriberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span> barged
into the house. <span class="SpellE">Eriberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span>
went directly to <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span> and poked a gun at his breast
and asked him to surrender his gun. <span class="SpellE">Ladislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Tayo</span> stood guard at the door while <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span>
de la Cruz went inside his mother's room. <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span>
protested that there was no fire­arm in the house. <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span>
de la Cruz ordered the house ransacked but found no weapon. He searched their
suit cases and clothes looking for a firearm and when he could not find any
they went away.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The next day, at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">six
 o'clock</st1:time> in the morning, the three came back. <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span>
de la Cruz asked Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Sorreta</span> to sign a state­ment
that the family would not com­plain about the death of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Sorreta</span> and if she would not sign they would be liquidated.
Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Sorreta</span> fainted and they left the house. At
about nine o'clock of the same day their houseboy came and told <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span> that the three men wanted to see him at the house of
his cousin-in-law, <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>,
about a hundred meters from their house. <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span> had no
choice because they were armed and he went to the house of <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span>.
When he arrived the three men were in the house with another man who turned out
to be Juan <span class="SpellE">Tobtob</span>. All of them were armed. <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span> de la Cruz asked <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span> to
sign a statement that he would not complain about the death of his father or he
and his family would be liquidated. <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span> de la <span class="GramE">Cruz,</span> gave him a piece of paper and pencil and dictated the
statement in <span class="SpellE">Bicol</span> dialect. <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span>
signed it and gave it to the accused. After having signed the statement they
allowed him to leave the house and go home.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"According to <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span>, while he was
writing the statement in <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cipriano's</span>
house, <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span> de la Cruz kept on berating his father
that he was a land grabber. He was then barely eighteen years old.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After the signing of the statement the family of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Sorreta</span> stayed in <span class="SpellE">Tinago</span> for
about two weeks. In the meantime, their relatives kept on informing <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span> that he would be the next victim. So, on a <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time>, he rode on a sailboat with a certain
Joaquin <span class="SpellE">Abundo</span> and sailed to <span class="SpellE">Baras</span>
where he stayed with his grandmother. His mother and sister followed later.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The testimony of Mrs. Carmen <span class="SpellE">Sorreta</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span> <span class="SpellE">Sorreta</span> is
corroborated by <span class="SpellE">Miguela</span> de Leon, a niece of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Sorreta</span>, who is well acquainted with <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span>
de la Cruz. In the afternoon of <st1:date year="1944" day="10" month="4">April
 10, 1944</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Miguela</span> went to <span class="SpellE">Tinago</span> to visit Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Sorreta</span> who
had just delivered. When she went up the house she passed by <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span> de la Cruz, <span class="SpellE">Ladislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Tayo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Eriberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span>, who, according to <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span>,
was a Constabulary soldier. They were in front of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Sorreta's</span>
house. It was about four o'clock in the afternoon. Inside the house was
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Tapar</span> who was talking with Atty. <span class="SpellE">Sorreta</span>. The whole family was in the house. <span class="SpellE">Miguela</span> did not stay long in the house and left while <span class="SpellE">Tapar</span> was still there. At about <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">six </span>o'clock on the same afternoon she went out to look for fish
and when she passed by the house of <span class="SpellE">Eufemia</span> <span class="SpellE">Litong</span>, she saw <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">Abundio</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> de la
Cruz, <span class="SpellE">Ladislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Tayo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Eriberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span> in the house. They
were drinking tuba. <span class="GramE">On the following day, April 11, at about
four o'clock in the morning, while <span class="SpellE">Eufemia</span> and her
husband were making salt near their house the three accused passed by.</span> Later
at around nine to ten o'clock Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Sorreta</span> sent word
that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Sorreta</span> had not returned from his fishing
trip and she and her husband went to Barrio Lt. <span class="SpellE">Ugalde</span>
and asked him to help in looking for the attorney. They did not find him. On
April 13, 1944, Ignacio Ted came and informed them that the body was seen in <span class="SpellE">Lusadan</span> being dashed to the shore by the waves. They went
to the barrio lieutenant and they sailed to <span class="SpellE">Lusadan</span>
and found the body. There was <span class="SpellE">hematoma</span> on the
forehead, on the chest and on the nape. Atty. <span class="SpellE">Sorreta</span>
had no more teeth. The body was taken to <span class="SpellE">Tinago</span> for
burial. <span class="SpellE">Miguela</span> saw the three accused again on the
16th day of April, the third day of the novena for the deceased in his house. On
that evening the three men barged into the house while they were saying their
prayers. <span class="SpellE">Eriberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span>
poked a gun at <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span> <span class="SpellE">Sorreta</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Ladislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Tayo</span> </span>stood
at the door blocking the way. <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span> de la Cruz
ransacked the house looking for a gun but found nothing and they left.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The evidence also shows that at about six o'clock in the
afternoon of April 10, 1944, <span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span> <span class="SpellE">Ugalde</span> was going to the chapel in <span class="SpellE">Tinago</span>
to ring the bell for the angelus. On the way he met Francisco <span class="SpellE">Tapar</span> who invited him to go to the <span class="SpellE">sitio</span>
of <span class="SpellE">Jolo</span> to drink tuba. <span class="SpellE">Ugalde</span>
acceded and they went to <span class="SpellE">Jolo</span> to the house of <span class="SpellE">Higino</span> <span class="SpellE">Litong</span>. <span class="SpellE">Tapar</span> went up the house while he stayed on the ground. <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span> de la Cruz was in the house and he heard him asking
<span class="SpellE">Tapar</span> who his companion was and <span class="SpellE">Tapar</span>
said that it was he <span class="SpellE">Ugalde</span>. <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span>
de la Cruz said that he should come up and he went up the house. <span class="SpellE">Ladislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Tayo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Eriberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span> were also in the

house. Then <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span> said to <span class="SpellE">Ugalde</span>,
'Belo, you are being dominated here in <span class="SpellE">Tinago</span> by a
great man.' <span class="SpellE">Ugalde</span> asked De la Cruz who the great man
was and he answered. 'Do not make any noise, we will finish him tonight.' <span class="SpellE">Ugalde</span> prodded <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span> to tell
him who was the great man and <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span> said it was <span class="SpellE">Sorreta</span>. After a while <span class="SpellE">Ugalde</span>
left the group because the procession for the '<st1:city><st1:place>Aurora</st1:place></st1:city>'
would begin. <span class="SpellE">Ugalde</span> subsequently learned of the
disappear­ance of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Sorreta</span> and when he was
eventually found dead in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>beach</st1:placetype> of

times. About two weeks later, however, he told Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Sorreta</span>
about it because <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span> de la Cruz was no longer in <span class="SpellE">Tinago</span>.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Another factor which the trial court considered as indicative of
the guilt of the accused was his having jumped bail in 1951. The lower court
said:</p>

<blockquote>"There is one last detail that <span class="GramE">points
strongly to the guilt of the accused and that is</span> flight. When he jumped
bail in 1951 with <span class="SpellE">Ladislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Tayo</span>,
in spite of so many orders of arrest and the search for him by the police
authorities <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span> de la Cruz was never apprehended.
It would be the height of <span class="SpellE">naivete</span> for the Court, to
believe even for a moment, that <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span> de la Cruz
was all the time in the places he claimed he was in his testimony bearing his
true name and yet was never apprehended by the police authorities who were in search
for him. And it is equally unthinkable and absurd to believe that he reported
regularly to his bondsmen when he left <span class="SpellE">Libmanan</span> after
he was bailed that they could have left him unmolested in spite of the
forfeiture and confis­cation of the amount of his bond to the tune of P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> which was no mean sum in those days when the peso <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>the peso. His flight and
continued disappearance for a period of almost twenty years could only mean one
thing — he knew he was guilty of a heinous offense and was mortally afraid to
face trial. But somehow destiny finally caught up with him and the law must
take its course."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant's version of the facts places him in another
province when the crime was committed. According to the appellant:</p>

<blockquote>"On the evening of <st1:date year="1944" day="10" month="4">April

 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Viga</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, <span class="SpellE">Catanduanes</span>, met his death. He was out alone at sea fishing
that night. He never returned alive. On the morning of <st1:date year="1944" day="13" month="4">April 13, 1944</st1:date>, his body was found at <span class="SpellE">Lusadan</span> beach presumably having been dashed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">ashore by sea waves.

<blockquote>"The barrio lieutenant, <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> <span class="SpellE">Ugalde</span>, who examined the body, attested: 'I did not find
anything in his body except that his body <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

physically the body. First I took off the clothing and let him face upward,
took off the pants and found nothing' (Pp. 195-196 <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<span class="SpellE">Libmanan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, with his family.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The prosecution would want it believed, however, that his
death was due to a premeditated criminal act of the accused-appellant in
conspiracy with others."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1970" day="24" month="11">November 24, 1970</st1:date>,
a decision was rendered convicting the accused of the crime of MURDER and
sentencing him to suffer the penalty of DEATH. The dispositive portion of the
decision reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in view of the fore­going considerations, the
Court hereby finds the accused, <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span> de la Cruz,
GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder under Article 248 of the
Revised Penal Code as charged in the amended information.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Four aggravating circumstances are alleged in the amended
information, to wit:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(1)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Advantage was taken of superior strength or
means were employed to weaken the defense;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(2)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>That the offense was committed during night
time;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(3)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>That it was committed in an uninhabited place;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(4)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>That the offense was deli­berately augmented
by causing other wrong not necessary for its commission.</blockquote>

<span class="SpellE">Tayo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Eriberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span> ganged up upon the attorney who was alone and
overwhelmed him by sheer strength of numbers. He was ambushed in the open sea
and the conspirators sought the cover of darkness to perpe­trate the crime with
impunity. Upon the other hand, the injuries suffered by the deceased are merely
the natural result of the aggression upon his person and it does not appear
that any of them was inflicted in order to deli­berately augment his suffering
or that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">it was not necessary in order

mitigating, the mandatory penalty is DEATH.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

saw that it had a black nape, swollen chin, shattered teeth and <span class="SpellE">hematoma</span> on the right forehead and breast. Due to the

April 9, 1944 we were served by <span class="SpellE">Eufemia</span> <span class="SpellE">Litong</span> of our supper having good chow with chicken soup. After
our meal I went down because I was perspiring and <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span>
de la Cruz and Francisco <span class="SpellE">Tapar</span> were talking of a
certain boat which <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span> de <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Ia</span></span> Cruz requested. After three minutes Francisco <span class="SpellE">Tapar</span> went down and left the house of <span class="SpellE">Eufemia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Litong</span>. After ten minutes had passed Francisco <span class="SpellE">Tapar</span> went back and approached <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span>
de la Cruz, and <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span> de la Cruz told us that we
will be going home to <span class="SpellE">Sicmil</span>, <span class="SpellE">Viga</span>,
<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Catanduanes</span></span>. I answered him
how we could go home when it is very dark and he answered in return that we
will go on sailing. Then we proceeded to the seashore where we found the boat
ready with two (2) paddles and we boarded the boat.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“7.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That while we were in the boat <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span> de la Cruz was the so-called pilot of the boat and
I took the other paddle and sat in the middle of the boat, so that <span class="SpellE">Ladislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Tayo</span> was in front. From <span class="SpellE">Tinago</span> we dropped in the house of <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Belda</span> at <span class="SpellE">sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayangan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Viga</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">that </span>was about <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">11:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening of <st1:date year="1944" day="9" month="4">April 9, 1944</st1:date> and we prepared local cigarette for
our smoke. After that we proceeded on our way home. In the course of our
sailing when <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">we </span>reached the
point of <span class="SpellE">Bayangan</span>, we saw someone sailing, and <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span> de la Cruz went direct to the one sailing. When we
reached that man sailing, <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span> de la Cruz told us
to stop the boat and we did as he alleged that he will talk with that man. We
went ahead of the other boat to block it. <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span> de
la Cruz immediately pinned down the right balance of the said boat causing
tilting (sic) it. At that instance Atty. <span class="SpellE">Sorreta</span>
asked why they are doing that way, and he asked further 'If I have done
anything wrong we can talk that over' and <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span> de
la Cruz replied 'What more talking and this is our time now.' The boat of Atty.
<span class="SpellE">Sorreta</span> was caught by the wave and he was thrown on
the sea and <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span> de la Cruz strike Atty. <span class="SpellE">Sorreta</span> with his paddle hitting the latter on the head and
at the second time he was hit on the neck and the boat was filled with water. After
the two blows given by <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span> de la Cruz to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Sorreta</span> he told us what we are doing more, if we want to be
the next, holding his pistol on the right hand and the paddle on the left hand.
After that <span class="SpellE">Ladislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Tayo</span>
and <span class="GramE">myself</span> jumped on the sea, then <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span>
de la Cruz returned his pistol on his belt and took hold of the paddle again. While
we were still on the sea swimming he gave another blow to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Sorreta</span> hitting the latter somewhere on the arm and the
breast. Then <span class="SpellE">Ladislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Tayo</span>
and <span class="GramE">myself</span> proceeded swimming to the boat of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Sorreta</span> with the order of <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span>
de la Cruz to help kill Atty. <span class="SpellE">Sorreta</span>. When we
reached Atty. <span class="SpellE">Sorreta</span> I found out that he was already
dead, and I told <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span> de la Cruz that he was
already dead. Then <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span> de la Cruz ordered us to
board on his boat and proceeded home. In the boat, <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span>
de la Cruz said these words (NAGBAYAD KA MAN GUIRARAY RAN DINAYA MONG DAGA,
ASIN MAKI HAPON). (You have at last paid for the land you grabbed,
pro-Japanese.) [English translation supplied.] Then <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span>
de la Cruz turned the boat bound for <span class="SpellE">Tinago</span>, and I
asked him why we will go back to <span class="SpellE">Tinago</span>, and he
answered that he has forgotten some­thing which is very important. When we were
near the shore I asked him who <span class="GramE">was that man whom he killed</span>
and he answered me that he is Atty. <span class="SpellE">Sorreta</span>. <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span> de la Cruz further states that we will not be
included in that inci­dent as he will take all the risk on what had happened. Then
we reached the <st1:place><st1:placetype>shore</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Tinago</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, having two small fish
which I took from the boat of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Sorreta</span> which was
floating on the sea.</blockquote>

conversing in English with <span class="SpellE">Eufemia</span> <span class="SpellE">Litong</span> and I proceeded to the kitchen to change my wet

<span class="SpellE">Litong</span> and <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span> de la
Cruz conversing each other, <span class="SpellE">Eufemia</span> <span class="SpellE">Litong</span> gave smile to <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span> de
