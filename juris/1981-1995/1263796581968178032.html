				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On the basis of a newspaper item, published <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">in </span>the September 13, 1982 issue of <u>Tempo</u>,
attributing various anomalies in the Metropolitan Trial Court of Manila to the
respondents, the Court on September 16, 1982 ordered Justice Jaime R. <span class="SpellE">Agloro</span> and later Justice Vicente V. Mendoza, both of the
Court of Appeals to conduct “preliminary" investigation of the matters
cited in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">news item.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On May 15, 1985, Justice Vicente V. Mendoza, while finding no
evidence directly linking Judge Antonio P. <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> to
the irregularities, recommended the filing of specific charges against the
respondents and the conduct of formal hearings to look into those charges.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case was referred to Executive Judge <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span>
M. <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> for investigation, report, and
recommendation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The report of Judge <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span>, dated <st1:date year="1987" day="25" month="8">August 25, 1987</st1:date> follows in full:</p>

<blockquote>"This administrative complaint or dishonesty and irregularity
in the raffle of cases <span class="GramE">was</span> instituted by then Acting
Court Administrator Hon. Arturo B. Buena.</blockquote>

<blockquote>By virtue of a Resolution of the Court en banc dated <st1:date year="1987" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1987</st1:date>, this case was
referred to the undersigned for investigation, report and <span class="GramE">recommendation</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Upon receipt of the records, the undersigned investigator
immediately set this case for investigation on <st1:date year="1987" day="14" month="5">May 14, 1987</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1987" day="21" month="5">May
 21, 1987</st1:date>, at <st1:time minute="0" hour="14">2:00 o'clock</st1:time>
in the afternoon, with notice to all the parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While all the respondents appeared on May 14,
1987, nobody much less any witness for the (private) complainant appeared despite
due notice, apparently indicating lack of interest or failure to prosecute (<span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">herber</span> v. Manuel, 99 SCRA
47 August 6, 1980).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Whereupon,
respondents submitted the case for resolution on the basis of the record and
their comments which were filed with the Supreme Court.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The complaint charges Judge Antonio P. <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>
along with some members of the staff for ‘dishonesty and irregularity in the
raffle <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>cases in violation of
Circular No. 8 dated September 23, 1974, is amended, Circular No. 20, dated
October 4, 1979 and Circular No. 3, dated April 24, 1975.’</blockquote>

<blockquote>Justice Vicente Mendoza of the Intermediate Appellate Court was
designated by the Court ‘in replacement the late Justice Jaime R. <span class="SpellE">Agloro</span>’ to conduct a preliminary fact-finding investigation
of the charges exposed by Mr. Ruther <span class="SpellE">Batuigas</span> in the
Tempo issue of <st1:date year="1982" day="13" month="9">September 13, 1982</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>While the Supreme Court ordered Justices <span class="SpellE">Agloro</span>
and Mendoza to conduct a preliminary fact-finding investigation, no preliminary
investigation could have been conducted by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">either </span>of them because as intimated in the report of Justice
Mendoza, there was <span class="GramE">no complaint nor</span> witnesses to
reckon with.</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'As indicated above, the principal difficulty of conducting the
investigation of the report in this case is the lack of complainant and witnesses.'
(p. 10).</p>

<blockquote>However, after the filing of the charges by
the Acting Court Administrator, the Supreme Court required comments/explanation
of respondents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All, except one <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> who has
chosen to be phased out under Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Bilang</span> 129 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">in </span>1983,
submitted their comments.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Respondent Judge submitted on <st1:date year="1986" day="6" month="3">March 6, 1986</st1:date> his resignation in the course of the
reorganization of the judiciary which was duly accepted on <st1:date year="1987" day="7" month="1">January 7, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He applied for disability retirement as early as <st1:date year="1985" day="24" month="4">April 24, 1985</st1:date> due to poor health.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">His </span>motion
to dismiss filed on <st1:date year="1987" day="15" month="1">January 15, 1987</st1:date>,
was referred by resolution in the <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">rollo</span></span>
of this case, and for whatever appropriate action Judge (now Justice) Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Benipayo</span> might deem necessary to take thereon and for the
submission of his recommendation within ten (10) days from notice.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Aside from denying the charges against him respondent <span class="SpellE">Baliton</span> was retired from the government service on <st1:date year="1986" day="18" month="4">April 18, 1986</st1:date> upon reaching the age
of 65.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He invokes the ruling of the
Supreme Court in the case of <span class="SpellE">Bayhon</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Tabigne</span>, Adm. Case No. 178-J, January 20, 1975 and <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">v. </span>Judge
<span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, 87 SCRA 344, December 29, 1978 that the
compulsory retirement of respondent renders the administrative complaint
against him moot and academic, and no useful purpose can be served by acceding
to the plea that there be further inquiry on the matter (<span class="SpellE">Agsalud</span>
v. Ramos 6 SCRA 629).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Respondent Judge likewise moves to dismiss the instant case against
him for being moot and academic based on the doctrine of acceptance and
resignation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Lopez v.
Judge <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>, 65 SCRA 13; <span class="SpellE">Reconose</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Tumulak</span>, G.R. Adm. Matter No. 329-MJ, April 30,
1976, 70 SCRA 458).</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Significantly, the Supreme Court has dismissed Administrative Case
No. <span class="GramE">RTJ-86-2 for lack of merit and also the dismissal of
Administrative Case No.</span> <span class="GramE">R-727-MYJ, also involving
respondent Judge, for having become moot and academic, again on the principle
of acceptance <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>respondent
judge's resignation.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In these
cases, the High Court stressed that it saw ‘no compelling reason to continue
further the investigation of these cases.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>Conformably, however, with<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>the
resolution of the Supreme Court dated <st1:date year="1987" day="31" month="3">March
 31, 1987</st1:date>, the undersigned, in addition to the ground that the case
has become moot and academic has seen it proper to pass upon the merits of the
case as briefly as possible.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It should be recalled that Court of
Appeals Justices Jaime <span class="SpellE">Agloro</span> (deceased) and Vicente
Mendoza were heretofore authorized by the Supreme Court to conduct a
preliminary fact-finding investigation of the instant case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Rightfully, Justice Mendoza deplored that
'the principal difficulty of conducting the investigation of the case was the
lack of complainant and witnesses.' He also stated that the absence of
complainants and witnesses makes it difficult to state exactly what part each
had in the apparent fixing of the cases <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">in
</span>the City Court of Manila’ (p. 8 Mendoza Report).</blockquote>

<blockquote>On the charge of dishonesty, there <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">is </span>no evidence whatsoever <span class="GramE">that respondents</span>
<span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> and <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
had ever made any collection from any violator of any municipal ordinance
brought to his court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing
irregular in the disposition of special arrested cases.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All of the requirements in the disposition of
said arrested cases have been complied with.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, th<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">e O</span>fficial Receipt
No. 7467774, dated <st1:date year="1982" day="24" month="8">August 24, 1982</st1:date>,
is indicated on the Information of Criminal Case No. 199753, indubitably
proving that the payment of the fine and costs were duly collected by the
cashier.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The allegation of collecting
P60.00 or more as fine from each vendor and the lion's share being shared by
respondents Judges <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> and <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
is obviously belied by the Information cited above.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The alleged violators never mentioned the
names of said respondents or their participation in their affidavits which were
attached to the NBI report (Annexes C, D, E and F, Comment).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Undoubtedly, there is no iota of evidence
that links <span class="GramE">respondents</span> judge and <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
to the charge of dishonesty.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Insofar as the charge of irregularity in the raffle of cases is
concerned, complainant charges violations of Circular No. 7 dated <st1:date year="1974" day="23" month="9">September 23, 1974</st1:date>, as amended by
Circular No. 20 dated <st1:date year="1979" day="4" month="10">October <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">4, </span>1979</st1:date>, and Circular No.
3 dated <st1:date year="1975" day="24" month="4">April 24, 1975</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Circul<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">ar</span> No. 7 has no application in the raffle of
cases in the Court of First Instance of Manila (now Regional Trial Court).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Circular No. 20 has likewise no application
to the instant case because it refers to disposition of criminal cases already
raffled.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Circular No. 3 is no longer
applicable because it was revoked or repealed effective <st1:date year="1985" day="1" month="8">August 1, 1985</st1:date> (See Supreme Court's en banc
Resolution dated July 30, 1985).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
other words, Circular No. 3 was no longer in existence when the instant
complaint dated <st1:date year="1985" day="17" month="9">September 17, 1985</st1:date>
was filed on <st1:date year="1985" day="26" month="9">September 26, 1985</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, there could be no prosecution from
any alleged violation of a dead and inexistent law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Be that as it may, an examination of the record reveals nothing
irregular in the raffle of cases conducted by respondent judge in Branch X of
the Metropolitan Trial Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
absence of irregularity in the raffle of civil cases was confirmed by Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Dalusong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Taca</span> and Rodriquez (See
Annexes "T", "U", and "V" of the Record) who were
the authorized representatives of the Acting Clerk of Court in every raffle
conducted in Branch X.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In their affidavits
given <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">to </span>the NBI, said representatives
categorically stated that they saw no anomaly in the raffle of cases conducted
in open court in Branch X of the City Court presided by respondent judge.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The staff members of respondent judge were <span class="GramE">not
members nor</span> representatives of the raffle committee but their duties
were to extend administrative and clerical assistance in the raffle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case of respondent <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, no further discussion of her participation
in the raffle is necessary as she opted to be phased out sometime in 1983 in
the course of the reorganization of the judiciary by virtue of BP No. 129.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The other judges who were supposed to attend the raffle of cases as
members of the raffle committee during specified periods of time never appeared
despite a reminder by<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span>the
executive judge (See Annexes "Y", "Y-1", "Y-2",
"Z", "Z-1" and "AA-1" of Annex "B" of
the complaint respectively).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In their
absence, respondent judge had no recourse but to go on with the raffle as the
daily raffle had been mandated by Circular No. 3 without exception.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This lack of attention by assigned judges to
the raffle of cases was rightly deplored by Justice <span class="SpellE">Agloro</span>
in his report (pp. 7-8 partial report J. <span class="SpellE">Agloro</span>, <st1:date year="1983" day="8" month="11">November 8, 1983</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The so-called Chinese cases which found their way in the expose of
a certain Ruther <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Batuigas</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> appear to have sparked this investigation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And yet, when we go into the bottom of the
accusation, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">we </span>see that the facts
were obviously presented in a rather unfair and distorted fashion.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is to be observed that the investigation made by the NBI was
confined only to 'Some Civil Cases Assigned to Each Branch’, as the title of
the report reads.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">And <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">so, </span>on the basis of a partial listing
of civil cases with so-called Chinese names, the NBI made the gratuitous
conclusion that most of these cases were channeled to Branch X presided by
respondent judge.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>In the face of this unfair and haphazard investigation made by the
NBI, respondent judge took it upon himself and at his own expense to prepare a
complete and exhaustive compilation of all civil cases with so-called Chinese
names covering the years 1980, 1981 and 1982.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And surprisingly, the result was just the opposite of what the NBI
found.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was an almost equal
distribution of so-called Chinese cases during the period referred to among the
different branches of the Metropolitan Trial Court of Manila.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The list of all said Chinese cases is
attached to the respondent judge's comment as Annexes 1, 1-A, 1-B and 1-C.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Additionally, while cases may bear Chinese names, this is really of
no consequence because so-called Chinese names, most of whom belong <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to </span>native Filipino citizens as well as
to naturalized Filipinos abound everywhere in the country.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, numerous government officials and
employees, clergymen and members of congress beat Chinese names.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Verily, the undersigned investigator finds nothing irregular in the
discharge of functions by the respondents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The members of the staff of respondent judge, even if they attended the
raffle, cannot be said to be dishonest either, as their official duties had
been regularly performed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Since an administrative case is<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt"> </span>regarded as penal in character, no less than a convincing proof
is required for conviction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is this
proof that is sorely wanting.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is
also worthy to note that the prosecution did not file any opposition or
objection to respondents' motion to dismiss.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And the highly respected Justice Mendoza made the finding in his report
that ‘there is no evidence that<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:31.0pt"> </span>directly
links Judge <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> to the irregularity.’ <span class="GramE">(p. 8 Report of Justice Mendoza).</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>As held in one case, the respondent judge is entitled to
exoneration when the charges against him were not established by preponderance
of evidence (<span class="SpellE">Buyoc</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Zosa</span>,
22 SCRA 1235).</blockquote>

<blockquote>No less than complainant in his Memorandum dated <st1:date year="1986" day="6" month="8">August 6, 1986</st1:date> made an observation
that ‘the facts of record are not sufficient to provide a basis for determining
whether or not the respondents maybe held administratively liable.' (Supreme
Court Resolution dated <st1:date year="1986" day="14" month="10">October 14,
 1986</st1:date> in Adm. Matter No. <span class="GramE">R-375-MTJ).</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Finally, as observed by Justice Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Benipayo</span>
who last investigated this case before the same was assigned to the
undersigned, that -</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'In line with the ruling of this Honorable Court in Angel <span class="SpellE">Reconose</span> v, Municipal Judge <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tumulak</span>, 70 SCRA 458, the undersigned respect<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">fully </span>recommends the dismissal of the
administrative complaint against the respondent judge.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As decided in said case, the acceptance of
the respondent Judge's resignation by the President has made moot and academic
the instant complaint.’</p>

<p class="2Q">'There were subsequent developments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The records likewise show that on <st1:date year="1973" day="31" month="5"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">May 31, </span>1973</st1:date>,
the resignation of Judge <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> N. <span class="SpellE">Tumulak</span> was accepted by the President.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances no further action
need be taken on these administrative cases against <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tumulak</span>.' (<span class="SpellE">Reconose</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Tumulak</span>, 70 SCRA 458).</p>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, for lack of evidence and merit, it is respectfully
recommended that the administrative case against all the respondents be
dismissed and that respondents Judge Antonio P. <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>
and Atty. Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Baliton</span> be allowed to retire with
all the privileges and benefits appurtenant thereto."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Immediately after the newspaper article reported alleged
anomalies in the raffling of cases in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
the Court ordered the Court Administrator to implement remedial measures that
