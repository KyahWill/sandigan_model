This is an appeal from the decision of the Court of First Instance of Cebu, the dispositive portion of which reads:
  <blockquote>
    <p> "WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused, Esperidion Recimiento, 
Jr. and Romeo Recimiento, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of
 murder described in the aforequoted information.  Appreciating in favor
 of the accused Esperidion Recimiento, Jr., the mitigating circumstance 
of voluntary surrender, but counting against both defendants the 
aggravating circumstance of complete disregard of the respect due the 
offend­ed party on account of his age and rank, the said accused should 
be, as they each are, hereby sen­tenced to the penalty of reclusion 
perpetua, with the accessory penalties of the law; to indemnify the 
heirs of the deceased Gregorio Macapaz in the sum of P12,000.00, and to 
pay the costs."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
The two appellants are brothers.  Only Romeo seeks complete acquittal 
claiming he had no part in the killing of the deceased, while Esperidion
 seeks modification of the crime committed from murder to simple 
homicide.  The Solicitor General after analyzing the evidence 
recom­mends that the crime committed be modified as requested, but 
insists on the participation of Romeo as a co-principal, at least, or as
 a co-conspirator.
</p><p>
The evidence for the prosecution would seek to prove the following facts as stated in the People's brief:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "At about 6 o'clock in the evening of May 15, 1978, on the 
occasion of the fiesta in Asturias, Cebu, the family of barrio 
councilman Gregorio Macapaz gathered at his house in Barrio Agtarap 
together with some guests.  Gregorio's son, Frisco Macapaz, who was 
present, had eaten his supper at his father's house although he resided 
at another house nearby.  (tsn, September 12, 1978, pp. 3-4). </p>
  <p> "Suddenly, a scream rang from Frisco's house.  Frisco's wife 
Visitacion was crying for help as there was a fight going on near the 
house.  Gregorio, Frisco and a guest by the name of Freddie Tabañag 
responded.  (Id., 4-5).  On their way, the three met Gregorio's other 
son, Elpidio, who told them that Gali Lacaba and appellant Esperi­dion 
Recimiento, Jr. were quarrelling.  Gregorio and Frisco proceeded on 
their way but Tabañag stayed behind to converse with Elpidio.  (Id., 
5-6). </p>
  <p> "Further on, Frisco went up his house to comfort his wife.  She 
told him that appellants Esperidion and Romeo Recimiento, on the one 
hand, and Gali Lacaba, on the other, were having a fight near the house.
  Frisco looked out from the window and saw his father Gregorio, with 
lamp in hand, approach the protagonists.  (Id., 6-7). </p>
  <p> "Gregorio urged appellants not to harm Lacaba since he was their 
own cousin.  Appellant Romeo turned on Gregorio instead and, without 
warning, stabbed him on the chest with a small bolo.  (Id., 7-8, 12).  
The latter reeled back with the lamp still in his hand.  Forthwith, 
ap­pellant Esperidion moved up and also stabbed him on the chest with a 
stainless hunting knife.  (Id., 9-10, 13).  As Gregorio fell down the 
char­coal pit, he cried out to his son Frisco to help him.  (Id., 11). </p>
  <p> "Frisco hurried down from his house but, before he could get to 
his father, appellants Romeo and Esperidion took turns in further 
stabbing Gregorio.  (Id., 18-19).  As Frisco reached his father's side, 
however, his assailants moved back.  Frisco cuddled his father who then 
acknowledged that he was going to die of the wounds inflicted by the 
appellants.  (Id., 20). </p>
  <p> "Just then, Elpidio Macapaz, Gregorio's other son, arrived and 
took his father into his arms.  Frisco faced appellants who began 
throwing stones.  One stone in particular hit Elpidio.  (Id.,          
21-22).  Freddie Tabañag also arrived prompt­ing appellants to flee.  
When Tabañag asked Gregorio who his assailants were, he replied that 
they were the appellants.  (Id., 22-23). </p>
  <p> "Gregorio was carried to his house but he died before reaching it.
  (Id., 24) According to the municipal health officer who conducted an 
autopsy of the body of the deceased, the latter sustained the following 
wounds: </p>
  <p> "External Examination: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> Patient is in state of Rigor Mortis.  There was signs of decom­position. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> "Estremeties: </p>

  <p> "Cause of Death: </p>

    </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
We first dwell on the question of whether Romeo took part in the stabbing of the deceased; which Romeo denies.
</p><p>
There are various circumstances to cast reasonable doubt on Romeo's having stabbed the deceased along with his brother.
</p><blockquote>
  <p> (1) Only two witnesses testified against Romeo, and they are both 
sons of the deceased.  The trial court mentioned along also as a witness
 whose testimony is positive as the other brother, Freddie Tabañag, as 
having testified against Romeo.  It is not true that Tabañag took the 
witness stand.  One would think, he was suppressed because he would 
testify against the prosecution and that if the two witnesses, both 
children of the deceased, testified the way they did, including Romeo, 
their relationship with the deceased was strong enough a motive to 
testify falsely, which is not so for a non-relative. </p>
  <p>
    (2) The testimony of the doctor who performed the autopsy would 
point that the wounds he found were caused by one and the same bladed 
instrument.  (pp. 27-30, tsn, September 4, 1978).  Yet the two 
appellants, according to Frisco Macapaz, had two different weapons, one a
 stainless knife, and another, a small bolo.
  </p>
  <p>
    (3) Frisco's testimony as to who delivered the first blow was 
variant.  In the reinvestigation of the Fiscal, he said it was 
Esperidion.  In Court on cross-examination it was Romeo.  (pp. 5-6, 
Appellant's Brief).
  </p>
  <p>
    (4) The defense explained that Esperidion was surrendered by his 
father.  If the two appellants were not in their house when the police 
went there, it is not that they fled.  Romeo went also to the Asturias 
Police Station to visit his brother who had surrendered.  If Romeo was 
as guilty as his brother who was surrendered by the father.  Romeo 
should also have surrendered.  (p. 9, Appellant's Brief) This could have
 easily been shown by the police blotter.  (p. 10, Appellant's Brief).
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
If Romeo had delivered as many stabs on vital part of the body of the 
deceased, Freddie Tabañag who was with Frisco and the latter's brother 
would have seen Romeo's participa­tion in the killing.  Why did not the 
prosecution present Tabañag as a witness instead of presenting only the 
two sons of the deceased?  As we have earlier stated Tabañag, if 
presented may come out with the truth and say that only Esperidion had a
 hand in the killing.
</p><p>
It is true the prosecution made mention of a dying declaration of the 
deceased which pointed to both Romeo and Esperidion as his assailants.  
But this was testified to only by Frisco whose testimony as already 
shown does not itself deserve full credibility for the dying declaration
 he testified about to be credible.
</p><p>
With the above circumstances, our mind cannot be made to rest easily on the guilt of Romeo.  He must accordingly be acquitted.
</p><p>
We agree with the Solicitor General that the crime committed is only 
simple homicide, the qualifying circumstance alleged not being present, 
not even treachery as the Solicitor General himself opined.
</p><p>
We, therefore, accept the recommendation of the Solicitor General but only as applied to Esperidion.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the appealed decision is modified in that Romeo Recimiento, 
whose guilt has not been established beyond reasonable doubt, is 
acquitted and Esperidion Recimiento, Jr. is convicted for the crime of 
homicide with the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender, 
without any aggravating circumstance and sentenced to an indeterminate 
penalty of SIX (6) YEARS and ONE (1) DAY of PRISION MAYOR as minimum to 
TWELVE (12) YEARS and ONE (1) DAY of RECLUSION TEMPORAL as maximum, with
 the accessory penalties of the law, to indemnify the heirs of the 
deceased Gregorio Macapaz in the sum of P12,000.00 and to pay the costs.
SO ORDERED.
</p><p>
<em>Concepcion, Jr., Guerrero, Abad Santos</em> and <em>Escolin</em>, JJ., concur.
</p><p>
<em>Makasiar</em>, Acting C.J., (Chairman), see partial dissent.
</p><p>
<em>Aquino</em>, J., dissents. The killing was murder qualified by abuse
 of superiority. The participation of Romeo Recimiento in the killing 
was proven beyond reasonable doubt as shown in the trial court’s 
findings. He votes to affirm the trial court’s judgment.

<p align="center"><strong>DISSENTING OPINION
</strong>

</p><p><strong>
MAKASIAR, J.:
</strong>
</p><p>
I concur with the conclusion that the crime committed is only homicide; 
because the qualifying circumstance of treachery is not established 
satis­factorily. However, both brothers-appellants should be convicted 
of homicide; because the testimonies of the sons of the deceased 
sufficed to establish that appellant Romeo is a co-principal by 
cooperation of appellant Esperidion. While state witness Freddie Tabañag
 was not presented by the prosecution, there is no showing that he was 
not equally available to the defense. At any rate, the testi­monies of 
the two sons of the deceased demonstrate beyond reasonable doubt the 
guilt of both appellants.
