obligations as such, if any, should be governed by Section 66 of the Negotiable
Instruments Law<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><u><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">*</span></span></u></span></a>/.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The subject checks were issued or drawn by
his customers and paid to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He could
not have had any knowledge as to the sufficiency of their funds in the <span class="SpellE">drawee</span> banks.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Office of the Solicitor General disputes the allegations of
the accused-appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to it,
by reason of the accused-appellant's antecedent acts of issuing and depositing
checks, and withdrawing the amounts thereof before clearing by the <span class="SpellE">drawee</span> banks, which checks were later honored and paid by
the <span class="SpellE">drawee</span> banks, he was able to gain the trust and
confidence of the Bank, such that the practice, albeit contrary to sound
banking policy, was tolerated by the Bank.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After thus having gained the trust and confidence of the Bank, the
accused-appellant issued and deposited the subject checks, the amounts of which
he later withdrew, fully aware that he had no sufficient funds to cover the
amounts of said checks in the <span class="SpellE">drawee</span> banks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Contrary to the accused-appellant's
allegation, the trial court found that he issued and deposited the subject
checks in his savings account.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As drawer
of the subject checks, the accused-appellant had the obligation to maintain
funds in his current account in the <span class="SpellE">drawee</span> banks
sufficient to cover the amounts thereof or, in case of dishonor, to deposit
within three (3) days from receipt of notice of dishonor, the amounts necessary
to cover the checks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The testimony of
Felix <span class="SpellE">Hocson</span>, Senior Vice President and Treasurer of
the Bank, apart from being hearsay, does not prove that the accused-appellant
made an offer to pay the amounts covered by the subject checks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even assuming <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span>
that the accused-appellant made an offer to pay the amounts covered by the
subject checks, said offer is not sufficient to rebut the <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u>
evidence of deceit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no showing
that the accused-appellant deposited the amounts necessary to cover the subject
checks within three (3) <span style="">days </span>from
receipt of notice from the Bank and/or the payee or holder that said checks
have been dishonored.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The damage
suffered by the Bank consists in its inability to make use of the P575<span class="GramE">,504.00</span> it had delivered to the accused-appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are convinced that the accused-appellant is innocent of the
crime charged against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 315, paragraph 2(d) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended
by Republic Act No. 4885, provides:</p>

evidence of deceit constituting false pretense or fraudulent act."</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The following are the elements of this
kind of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) postdating or issuance of a check in payment of an obligation
contracted at the time the check was issued; (2) lack or insufficiency of funds
to cover the check; and (3) damage to the payee thereof (People v. <span class="SpellE">Tugbang</span>, et al., G.R. No. 76212, April, 26, 1991; Sales v.
Court of Appeals, et al., G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-47817, August 29, 1988,

G.R. No.</span> <span class="GramE">L-45490, November 20, 1978, 86 SCRA 568).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Based thereon, the trial court concluded that
the guilt of the accused-appellant has "been duly established by the
required quantum of evidence adduced by the People against (him)" (p. 22, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
shall confine <span class="GramE">Our</span> discussion only on the first element
because there is no argument that the second and third elements are present in
this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For an orderly discussion of
this element, <span class="GramE">We</span> will divide it into two (2)
parts:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>first, "postdating or
issuance of a check," and second, "in payment of an obligation contracted
at the time the check was issued."</p>

<p class="BODY">Inasmuch as the first part of the first element of Article 315,
paragraph 2(d) of the Revised Penal Code is concerned with the act of
"postdating or <u>issuance</u> of a check," the accused-appellant
raises the defense that he was neither the issuer nor drawer of the subject
checks, but only an <span class="SpellE">indorser</span> thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, his liability, if any, should be
governed by the provision of the Negotiable Instruments Law, particularly
Section 66 thereof, <u>supra</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also,
he could not have had any knowledge as to the sufficiency of the drawers’ funds
in their respective banks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Office of
the Solicitor General contends that the trial court found as a fact that the
accused-appellant issued the subject checks.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention of the Office of the Solicitor General is accurate
only in part.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the trial court's
disquisition on the liability of the accused-appellant, it, said (p. 22, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>):<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<blockquote>"There is no question that on January 30, 1979, accused Dick <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> <u>issued</u> <u>or</u> <u>used</u> <u>and indorsed</u>,
and deposited in his Savings Account No. 6-1981 with the Bank the four checks x
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"There is likewise no dispute that on the following date,
January 31, 1979, Dick <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> <u>issued</u> <u>or</u> <u>used</u>
<u>and</u> <u>indorsed</u>, and deposited in his savings account with the Bank
seven checks x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>." (<span class="GramE">underscoring</span> supplied) </blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">On this subject matter, Fernando <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span>, Internal Auditor of the Bank and a witness for
the prosecution, testified that (pp. 101-103, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
January 7, 1981):</p>

<blockquote>"Court -</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You
mentioned these checks, Mr. Witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Did
you or anybody for that matter ever verify the actual depositors of these
checks whether it is Mr. Dick <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> himself?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
<span class="GramE">Your</span> Honor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our
Vice-President for Bank Operations verified said checks and found out that one
of or rather, <u>two</u> <u>of</u> <u>those</u> <u>checks</u> <u>are</u> <u>in</u>
<u>the</u> <u>account</u> <u>of</u> <u>Mr</u>. <u>Dick</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Onq</u></span>
<u>but</u> <u>the</u> <u>other</u> <u>checks</u> <u>are</u> <u>not</u> <u><span style="">in</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>his</u> <u>account</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>Court -</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
other words, there are checks where the depositor himself was also Mr. Dick <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Could I go over the checks, <span class="GramE">Your</span> Honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Is
it indicated there?<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
Your Honor, it is.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All
right, go over the checks.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
is one check, Your Honor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a China
Banking Corporation Check in the amount of P69<span class="GramE">,850.00</span>
(Witness referring to Exhibit 'Z').</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now,
why do you say that the current checking account or current account was opened
by Mr. Dick <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> himself?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
he is the drawer of the check, <span class="GramE">Your</span> Honor." (<span class="GramE">underscoring</span> supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Thus,<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
fact established by the prosecution and adopted by the trial court is that the
subject checks were <u>either</u> <u>issued</u> <u>or</u> <u>indorsed</u> by
the accused-appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of People v<span style="">. </span><span class="SpellE">Isleta</span>, et al., 61 Phil. 332, which was recently reiterated
in the case of <span class="SpellE">Zagado</span> v. Court Of Appeals, G.R. No.
76612, September 29, 1989, 178 SCRA 146, We declared the accused?appellant,
who only negotiated the check drawn by another, guilty of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This case of People v. <span class="SpellE">Isleta</span>,
et al. was relied upon by the trial court in its order dated April 3, 1990,
which denied the accused-appellant's motion for reconsideration based on the
same defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court erred in
doing so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must have overlooked the <u>ratio</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>decidendi</u></span> of the aforementioned case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We held the accused-appellant therein guilty
of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> because he "had guilty knowledge of
the fact that (the drawer) had no funds in the bank when he negotiated the
(subject) check" (at p. 334).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the present case, the prosecution failed to prove that the accused-appellant
had such knowledge with respect to the subject checks that he indorsed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In applying <span class="GramE">Our</span>
decisions, it is not enough that courts take into account only the facts and
the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portions thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is imperative that the rationale of these
decisions be read and comprehended thoroughly.</p>

<p class="BODY">It goes without saying that with respect to the subject checks
wherein the accused-appellant was the issuer/drawer, the first part of the
first element of Article 315, paragraph 2(d) of the Revised Penal Code is
applicable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, this statement will
lose its significance in <span class="GramE">Our</span> next discussion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Regarding the second part of the first element of Article 315,
paragraph 2(d) of the Revised Penal Code, the accused-appellant alleges that
when he deposited the subject checks in his savings account, it was clearly not
in payment of an obligation to the Bank.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Office of the Solicitor General misses this point of the
accused-appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">This single argument of the accuse-appellant spells tilting the
scale to his advantage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In several
cases, <span class="GramE">We</span> were categorical that bank deposits are in
the nature of irregular deposits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
are really loans because they earn interest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All kinds of bank deposits, whether fixed, savings, or current are to be
treated as loans and are to be covered by the law on loans.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Current and savings deposits are loans to a
bank because it can use the same (Serrano v. Central Bank of the Philippines,
et al., G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-30511, February 14, 1980, 96 SCRA 96; <span class="SpellE">Gullas</span> v. Philippine National Bank, 62 Phil. 519; Central
Bank of the Philippines v. <span class="SpellE">Morfe</span>, etc., et al., G.R.
No.</span> <span class="GramE">L-38427, March 12, 1975, 63 SCRA 114; <span class="SpellE">Guingona</span>, Jr., et al. v.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The City Fiscal of Manila,
et al., G.R. No. 60033, April 4, 1984, 128 SCRA 577).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The elements of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> in general
are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that the accused defrauded
another (a) by abuse of confidence, or (b) by means of deceit; and (2) that
damage or prejudice capable of pecuniary estimation is caused to the offended
party or third person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aside from the
elements that We have discussed earlier, in the crime of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
by postdating or issuing a bad check, deceit and damage are essential elements
of the offense and have to be established, with satisfactory proof to warrant
conviction (U.S. v. Rivera, 23 Phil. 383; People, et <span style="">al. </span>v. <span class="SpellE">Grospe</span>, etc., et al., G.R. No.
74053-54, January 20, 1988, 157 SCRA 154; <span class="SpellE">Buaya</span> v.
Polo, etc., et al., G.R. No. 75079, January 26, 1989, 169 SCRA 471).</p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, the Office of the Solicitor General advances
the view that by reason of the accused-appellant's antecedent acts of issuing
and depositing checks, and withdrawing the amounts thereof before clearing by
the <span class="SpellE">drawee</span> banks, which checks were later honored and
paid by the <span class="SpellE">drawee</span> banks, he was able to gain the
trust and confidence of the Bank, such that the practice, albeit contrary to
sound banking <span style="">policy, </span>was
tolerated by the Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After thus having
gained the trust and confidence of the Bank, he issued and deposited the
subject checks, the amounts of which he later withdrew, fully aware that he had
no sufficient funds to cover the amounts of said checks in the <span class="SpellE">drawee</span> banks.</p>

<p class="BODY">This view is not supported by the facts of this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rather, the evidence for the prosecution
proved that the Bank on its own accorded him a drawn against uncollected
deposit (DAUD) privilege without need of any pretensions on his part (pp. 7-8, <u>supra</u>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, this privilege was not only for the
subject checks, but for other past transactions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fernando <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span>
and Felix <span class="SpellE">Hocson</span> even testified that in some
instances prior to July 1, 1980, especially where the depositor is an important
client, the Bank relaxed its rule and internal policy against <span class="SpellE">uncleared</span> checks and uncollected deposits, and allowed such
depositor to withdraw against his <span class="SpellE">uncleared</span> checks
and uncollected deposits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Admittedly,
the accused-appellant was one of the important depositors of the Bank (pp.
24-25, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Granting, <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>gratia</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>argumenti</u></span>, that he had in fact acted fraudulently,
he could not have done so without the active cooperation of the Bank's
employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, since <span class="SpellE">Lucila</span> <span class="SpellE">Talabis</span> and Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Villaran</span> were declared innocent of the crimes charged
against them, the same should be said for the accused-appellant (see People v. <span class="SpellE">Jalandoni</span>, G.R. No. 57555, May 30, 1983, 122 SCRA
588).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True it is that the Bank suffered
damage in the amount of P575<span class="GramE">,504.00</span> but the accused?appellant's
liability thereon is only civil.</p>

<p class="BODY">One additional statement made by the trial court in its decision
requires correction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It said that
"[t]he circumstances that the drawer of a check had insufficient or no
funds in the <span class="SpellE">drawee</span> bank to cover the amount of his
check <span style="">at </span>the time of its issuance
and he did not inform the payee or holder of such fact, are sufficient to make
him liable for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>" (p. 23, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
statement is no longer controlling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
have clarified in the case of People v. <span class="SpellE">Sabio</span>, Sr.,
etc., et al., <u>supra</u>, that Republic Act No. 4885 has eliminated the
requirement under the old provision for the drawer to inform the payee that he
had no funds the bank or the funds deposited by him were not sufficient to
cover the amount of the check.</p>

<p class="BODY">We, therefore, find that the guilt of the accused-appellant <span style="">for </span>the crime of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
under Article 315, paragraph 2(d) of the Revised Penal Code has not been proven
beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, We
find him civilly liable to the Bank in the amount of P575<span class="GramE">,504.00</span>,
less the balance remaining <span style="">in </span>his
savings account with it (p. 26, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>), with
legal interest from the date of the filing of this case until full payment.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the decision and order appealed from are
hereby SET ASIDE.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused-appellant
is ACQUITTED of the crime charged against him but ordered to pay the
aforementioned amount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
