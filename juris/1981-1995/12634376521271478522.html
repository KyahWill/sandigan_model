				<BR><STRONG>CRUZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Sometime in 1980, Juanito C. Lapuz, an automotive electrician,
was contracted for employment in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, for a period of one year
through Pan Pacific Overseas Recruiting Services, Inc. Lapuz was supposed to
leave on November 8, 1980, via Korean Airlines.  Initially, he was "wait-listed," which meant that he
could only be accommodated if any of the confirmed passengers failed to show up
at the airport before departure.  When two
of such passengers did not appear, Lapuz and another person by the name of
Perico were given the two unclaimed seats.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to Lapuz, he was allowed to check in with one suitcase
and one shoulder bag at the check-in counter of KAL.  He passed through the customs and immigration sections for
routine check-up and was cleared for departure as Passenger No. 157 of KAL
Flight No. KE 903.  Together with the
other passengers, he rode in the shuttle bus and proceeded to the ramp of the
KAL aircraft for boarding.  However,
when he was at the third or fourth rung of the stairs, a KAL officer pointed to
him and shouted "Down! Down!" He was thus barred from taking the
flight.  When he later asked for another
booking, his ticket was canceled by KAL.  Consequently, he was unable to report for his work in Saudi Arabia
within the stipulated 2-week period and so lost his employment.</p>

<p class="BODY">KAL, on the other hand, alleged that on November 8, 1980, Pan
Pacific Recruiting Services Inc. coordinated with KAL for the departure of 30
contract workers, of whom only 21 were confirmed and 9 were wait-listed
passengers.  The agent of Pan Pacific,
Jimmie Joseph, after being informed that there was a possibility of having one
or two seats becoming available, gave priority to Perico, who was one of the
supervisors of the hiring company in Saudi Arabia.  The other seat was won through lottery by Lapuz.  However, only one seat became available and
so, pursuant to the earlier agreement that Perico was to be given priority, he
alone was allowed to board.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 30,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
adjudged KAL liable for damages, disposing as follows:</p>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing consideration, judgment is
hereby rendered sentencing the defendant Korean Air Lines to pay plaintiff
Juanito C. Lapuz the following:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1. The amount of TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY-TWO THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SIXTY
(P272,160.00) PESOS as actual/ compensatory  damages, with legal interest thereon from the date of the filing of the
complaint until fully paid.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.  The sum of TWENTY-FIVE
THOUSAND (P25,000.00) PESOS as and for attorney's fees; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.  The costs of suit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The case is hereby dismissed with respect to defendant Pan Pacific
Overseas Recruiting Services, Inc.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The counterclaims and cross-claim of defendant Korean Air Lines
Co., Ltd. are likewise dismissed.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, this decision was modified by the Court of Appeals<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, the appealed judgment is
hereby AFFIRMED with the following modifications:  the amount of actual damages and compensatory damages is reduced
to P60,000.00 and defendant-appellant is hereby ordered to pay
plaintiff-appellant the sum of One Hundred Thousand Pesos (P100,000.00) by way
of moral and exemplary damages, at 6% interest per annum from the date of the
filing of the Complaint until fully paid.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">KAL and Lapuz filed their respective motions for reconsideration,
which were both denied for lack of merit.  Hence, the present petitions for review which have been consolidated
because of the identity of the parties and the similarity of the issues.</p>

<p class="BODY">In G.R. No. 114061, KAL assails the decision of the appellate
court on the following grounds:</p>

<blockquote>1. That the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that petitioner
committed a breach of contract of carriage notwithstanding lack of proper,
competent and sufficient evidence of the existence of such contract.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2. That the Court of Appeals erred in not according the proper
evidentiary weight to some evidence presented and the fact that private  respondent did not have any boarding pass
to prove that he was allowed to board and to prove that his airline ticket was
confirmed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3. That the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that the standby
passenger status of private respondent Lapuz was changed to a confirmed status
when his name was entered into the passenger manifest.</blockquote>

<blockquote>4. That the Court of Appeals abused its discretion in awarding
moral and exemplary damages in the amount of P100,000.00 in favor of private
respondent notwithstanding its lack of basis and private respondent did not
state such amount in his complaint nor had private respondent proven the said
damages.</blockquote>

<blockquote>5. That the Court of Appeals erred in dismissing the counterclaims.</blockquote>

<blockquote>6. That the Court of Appeals erred in dismissing the counterclaim
of petitioner against Pan Pacific.</blockquote>

<blockquote>7. That the Court of Appeals erred in ruling that the 6% per annum
legal interest on the judgment shall be computed from the filing of the
complaint.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In G.R. No. 113842, Lapuz seeks:  (a) the setting aside of the decision of the Court of Appeals insofar as
it modifies the award of damages; b) actual and compensatory damages in the sum
equivalent to 5 years' loss of earnings based on the petitioner's monthly
salary of 1,600 Saudi rials at the current conversion rate plus the cost of
baggage and personal belongings worth P2,000 and the service fee of P3,000 paid
to the recruiting agency, all with legal interest from the filing of the
complaint until fully paid; c) moral damages of not less than P1 million and
exemplary damages of not less than P500,000.00, both with interest at 6% per
annum from the filing of the complaint; and d) attorney's fees in the sum
equivalent to 30% of the award of damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is evident that the issues raised in these petitions relate
mainly to the correctness of the factual findings of the Court of Appeals and
the award of damages.  The Court has
consistently affirmed that the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals and the
other lower courts are as a rule binding upon it, subject to certain
exceptions.  As nothing in the record
indicates any of such exceptions, the factual conclusions of the appellate
court must be affirmed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The status of Lapuz as standby passenger was changed to that of a
confirmed passenger when his name was entered in the passenger manifest of KAL
for its Flight No. KE 903.  His
clearance through immigration and customs clearly shows that he had indeed been
confirmed as a passenger of KAL in that flight.  KAL thus committed a breach of the contract of carriage between
them when it failed to bring Lapuz to his destination.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court has held that a contract to transport passengers is
different in kind and degree from any other contractual relation.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The business of the carrier is mainly with the traveling public.  It invites people to avail themselves of the
comforts and advantages it offers.  The
contract of air carriage generates a relation attended with a public duty.  Passengers have the right to be treated by
the carrier's employees with kindness, respect, courtesy and due
consideration.  They are entitled to be
protected against personal misconduct, injurious language, indignities and
abuses from such employees.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> So it
is that any discourteous conduct on the part of these employees toward a passenger
gives the latter an action for damages against the carrier.</p>

<p class="BODY">The breach of contract was aggravated in this case when, instead
of courteously informing Lapuz of his being a "wait-listed"
passenger, a KAL officer rudely shouted "Down! Down!" while pointing
at him, thus causing him embarrassment and public humiliation.</p>

<p class="BODY">KAL argues that "the evidence of confirmation of a chance
passenger status is not through the entry of the name of a chance passenger in
the passenger manifest nor the clearance from the Commission on Immigration and
Deportation, because they are merely means of facilitating the boarding of a
chance passenger in case his status is confirmed." We are not persuaded.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence presented by Lapuz shows that he had indeed checked
in at the departure counter, passed through customs and immigration, boarded
the shuttle bus and proceeded to the ramp of KAL's aircraft.  In fact, his baggage had already been loaded
in KAL' s aircraft, to be flown with him to Jeddah.  The contract of carriage between him and KAL had already been
perfected when he was summarily and insolently prevented from boarding the
aircraft.</p>

<p class="BODY">KAL's allegation that the respondent court abused its discretion
in awarding moral and exemplary damages is also not tenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals granted moral and exemplary damages because:</p>

<blockquote>The findings of the court <i><span style="">a
quo </span></i>that the defendant-appellant has committed breach of contract of
carriage in bad faith and in wanton, disregard of plaintiff-appellant's rights
as passenger laid the basis and justification of an award for moral damages.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the instant case, we find that defendant-appellant Korean Air
Lines acted in a wanton, fraudulent, reckless, oppressive or malevolent manner
when it "bumped off" plaintiff-appellant on November 8, 1980, and in
addition treated him rudely and arrogantly as a "patay gutom na contract
worker fighting Korean Air Lines," which clearly shows malice and bad
faith, thus entitling plaintiff-appellant to moral damages.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>Considering that the plaintiff-appellant's entitlement to moral
damages has been fully established by oral and documentary evidence, exemplary
damages may be awarded.  In fact,
exemplary damages may be awarded, even though not so expressly pleaded in the
complaint (Kapoe vs. Masa, 134 SCRA 231).  By the same token, to provide an example for the public good, an award
of exemplary damages is also proper (Armovit vs. Court of Appeals, <i><span style="">supra</span></i><span style="">).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, Lapuz's claim that the award of P100,000.00 as
moral and exemplary damages is inadequate is not acceptable either.  His prayer for moral damages of not less
than P1 million and exemplary damages of not less than P500,000.00 is
overblown.</p>

<p class="BODY">The well-entrenched principle is that moral damages depend upon
the discretion of the court based on the circumstances of each case.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
This discretion is limited by the principle that the "amount awarded
should not be palpably and scandalously excessive" as to indicate that it
was the result of prejudice or corruption on the part of the trial court.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Damages are not intended to enrich the complainant at the expense of the
defendant.  They are awarded only to
alleviate the moral suffering that the injured party had undergone by reason of
the defendant's culpable action.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> There
is no hard-and-fast rule in the determination of what would be a fair amount of
moral damages since each case must be governed by its own peculiar facts.</p>

<p class="BODY">A review of the record of this case shows that the injury
suffered by Lapuz is not so serious or extensive as to warrant an award of P1.5
million.  The assessment of P100,000 as
moral and exemplary damages in his favor is, in our view, reasonable and
realistic.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lapuz likewise claims that the respondent court could not rule
upon the propriety of the award of actual damages because it had not been
assigned as an error by KAL.  Not
so.  The rule is that only errors
specifically assigned and properly argued in the brief will be considered
except errors affecting jurisdiction over the subject matter and plain as well
as clerical errors.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
But this is not without qualification for, as the Court held in Vda. de
Javellana vs. Court of Appeals:<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote><span style="">x x x </span>[T]he Court is
clothed with ample authority to review matters, even if they are not assigned
as errors in their appeal, if it finds that their consideration is necessary in
arriving at a just decision of the case.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A similar pronouncement
was made in Baquiran vs. Court </span>of Appeals<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a> in
this wise:</p>

<blockquote>Issues, though not specifically raised in the pleading in the
appellate court, may, in the interest of justice, be properly considered by
said court in deciding a case, if they are questions raised in the trial court
and are matters of <span style="">record </span>having
some bearing on the issue submitted which the parties failed to raise or the
lower court ignored. </blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals was therefore justified in decreasing the
award of actual damages even if the issue was not assigned as an error by
KAL.  Consideration of this question was
necessary for the just and complete resolution of the present case.  Furthermore, there was enough evidence to
warrant the reduction of the original award, as the challenged decision
correctly observed:</p>

<blockquote>A perusal of the plaintiff-appellant's contract of employment shows
that the effectivity of the contract is for only one year, renewable every year
for five years.  Although
plaintiff-appellant intends to renew his contract, such renewal will still be
subject to his foreign employer.  Plaintiff-appellant had not yet started working with his foreign
employer, hence, there can be no basis as to whether his contract will be
renewed by his foreign employer or not.  Thus, the damages representing the loss of earnings of
plaintiff-appellant in the renewal of the contract of employment is at most
speculative.  Damages may not be awarded
on the basis of speculation or conjecture (Gachalian vs. Delim, 203 SCRA
126).  Hence, defendant-appellant's
liability is limited to the one year contract only.  Plaintiff-appellant is, therefore, entitled only to his lost
earnings for one year, i.e., P60,000.00, which is 1/5 of P300,000.00, the total
amount of actual damages, representing lost earnings for five years prayed for
in the Complaint.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Plaintiff-appellant's contention that in computing his lost
earnings, the current rate of the Saudi Rial to the Philippine Peso at the time
of payment should be used, is untenable, considering that in his Complaint,
plaintiff-appellant has quantified in Philippine Peso his lost earnings for
five years.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We disagree with the respondent court, however, on the date when
the legal interest should commence to run.  The rule is that the legal interest of six percent (6%) on the amounts
adjudged in favor of Lapuz should resume from the time of the rendition of the
trial court's decision instead of November 28, 1980, the date of the filing of
the complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">On this matter, the Court has held:</p>

<blockquote>If suit were for payment of a definite sum of money, the contention
might be tenable.  However, if it is for
damages, unliquidated and not known until definitely ascertained, assessed and
determined by the courts after proof, interest should be from the date of the
decision.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>The obligation to pay interest on a sum filed in a judgment exists
from the date of the sentence, when so declared; for until the net amount of the
debtor's liability has been determined, he cannot he considered delinquent in
the fulfillment of his obligation to pay the debt with interest thereon.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Finally, we find that the respondent court did not err in
sustaining the trial court's dismissal of KAL's counterclaim against Pan
Pacific Overseas Recruiting Recruiting Services Inc., whose responsibility
ended with the confirmation by KAL of Lapuz as its passenger in its Flight No.
903.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is still another case of the maltreatment of our overseas
contract workers, this time by the airline supposed to bring the passenger to
his foreign assignment.  Our OCWs
sacrifice much in seeking employment abroad, where they are deprived of the
company of their loved ones, the direct protection of our laws, and the comfort
of our own native culture and way of life.  This Court shall exert every effort to vindicate their rights when they
are abused and shall accord them the commensurate reparation of their injuries
consistent with their dignity and worth as members of the working class.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed judgment is AFFIRMED, but with the
modification that the legal interest on the damages awarded to private
respondent should commence from the date of the decision of the trial court on
November 14, 1990.  The parties shall
bear their own costs.</p>
