				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal from the decision of the Regional Trial Court,
Branch 15, Tabaco, Albay, finding Ricardo, Manuel and Bonifacio, all surnamed
Buela, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Murder.</p>

<p class="BODY">The information filed against appellants reads as follows:</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">INFORMATION</p>

<blockquote>"That on about the 27th day of December, 1988 at about 2:00
o'clock (sic) in the afternoon, more or less, at Purok 9, Barangay San Antonio,
Municipality of Tabaco, Province of Albay, Philippines and within the
jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring,
confederating and helping one another, taking advantage of superior strength,
with evident premeditation and treachery, and with intent to kill, did then and
there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, stab, hack and hit
BIENVENIDO BODINO Y BORLAGDAN with a bolo and hardwood (bahi), thereby
inflicting upon the latter fatal wounds on the forehead, neck and other parts
of his body which caused his direct and immediate death, to the damage and
prejudice of the heirs of BIENVENIDO BODINO y BORLAGDAN" (Rollo, p. 19).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">At their arraignment, the appellants pleaded not guilty.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the court <u>a quo</u>, on December 27, 1988 at
around 7:00 A.M., Bienvenido Bodino was having breakfast at his house when
Ricardo Buela arrived and invited him for a drink.  Bodino accepted the invitation and the two repaired to the house
of Bodino's sister, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Adalia Maduro.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After consuming two bottles of gin and while in an inebriated
state, Bodino and Ricardo began to dance with each other.  At about lunchtime, Salvacion, Bodino's
wife, came to fetch him.  Bodino told
her to wait a while since he was still enjoying his cavort with Ricardo.  While they were dancing, the pair
accidentally tripped and fell on the cement floor causing Ricardo's right
eyebrow to bleed.  After this incident,
Bodino went home with his wife.</p>

<p class="BODY">At around 1:00 P.M., while Bodino was in his front yard, he was
suddenly attacked by Ricardo and his two brothers, Manuel and Bonifacio.  The first to attack was Bonifacio, who hit
Bodino with a wooden club, locally called "bahi." Then, Ricardo
hacked Bodino with a bolo, followed by Manuel, who also struck the victim with
a wooden club.</p>

<p class="BODY">Salvacion tried to embrace her husband but Ricardo pushed her
away.  She then shouted for help, and was
heard by Bodino's sister, Adalia Maduro, who rushed to the yard of the
Bodinos.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">Adalia saw </span>Bodino lying prostrate on the ground with the three
assailants still taking turns in hitting him with their weapons.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants then left.  After having walked a distance of about three meters, Ricardo returned
to where the prostrate body of Bodino laid and hacked him again.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the defense, on December 27, 1988, Ricardo went to
the house of Bodino to collect a P10.00 debt.  After paying Ricardo, Bodino invited him to have a drink at the house of
Adalia Maduro.  Ricardo accepted the
invitation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Bodino and Ricardo were former members of the New People's Army,
who surrendered on December 31, 1987.  While they were drinking, Bodino tried to proselytize Ricardo back to
the movement but the latter rebuffed him.  Afterwards, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">while they were
dancing, they tripped and fell on the floor.  One of Ricardo's eyebrows sustained a wound and bled.  Bodino invited Ricardo for lunch but he
declined and instead went home.  After
lunch, Ricardo realized that he had left his bolo at the house of Adalia
Maduro; so he went back for it.  On his
way home, Ricardo met Bodino, who tried to block his path.  Bodino asked him to rejoin the New People's
Army and when he refused, Bodino got angry.  At this juncture, Aurora Buela, Ricardo's mother, arrived together with
his two brothers, Bonifacio and Manuel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon seeing them, Bodino went to the house of Adalia Maduro and
came back armed with a wooden club.  He
confronted the Buelas and even taunted them to a fight.  Then Bodino struck Ricardo with his
club.  The latter was able to duck and
evade the blow, which instead landed on Aurora Buela's forehead.  She fell on the ground <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">unconscious.  Upon seeing what happened to his mother, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">Bonifacio immediately grappled with Bodino and was able to wrest the
wooden club from him.  Bonifacio used
the same club to strike Bodino at the back of his head.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Manuel and Bonifacio Buela carried their mother home, leaving
Ricardo and Bodino behind.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court convicted appellants and sentenced them to suffer
the penalty of <u>reclusion perpetua</u> (Rollo, p. 155).</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants contend that the trial court erred in rejecting their
version that Bodino was the aggressor and in finding that their mother was not
even present at the crime scene (Rollo, p. 135).  Appellants also question the finding of the trial court that
Manuel Buela participated in killing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Bodino
(Rollo, p. 134).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">While admitting that they hacked and beat Bodino, Ricardo and
Bonifacio claimed that they acted in self-defense and in the defense of their
mother.  They insisted that when they
saw their mother collapse and the blood spurting from her forehead, "they
lost control of their actions xxx" (Rollo, pp. 134-135).</p>

<p class="BODY">On rebuttal, Salvacion Bodino, the widow of Bodino, testified
that appellants' mother was not at the crime scene at all and that the only
person thereat, aside from her and her children was Adalia Maduro, the sister
of the victim (Rollo, p. 148).</p>

<p class="BODY">  Appellants did not rebut
the testimony of Salvacion Bodino that Aurora Buela was not with them when they
intruded into her front yard.  The
center piece of appellants' defense was that Bodino was the first to deliver a
blow directed at Ricardo, but, which instead, landed on<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"> the forehead of appellants' mother.  The presentation of sur-rebuttal evidence to neutralize </span>the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">evidence of the prosecution </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">on </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">this regard, was crucial.  Appellants assert that they waived the presentation of the sur-rebuttal
evidence "to expedite the trial so that they can avail of their
constitutional right to a speedy trial" (Rollo, p. 134).  We are not persuaded and are inclined to
agree with the observation of the Solicitor General that the version on the
presence of appellants' mother at the crime scene was "nothing more than a
concocted story devoid of any semblance of credibility" (Rollo, p.
80).  The reason for the presence of
appellant's mother was not shown.  For that
matter, the sudden appearance of Bonifacio and Manuel at the crime scene was
not explained.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The participation of Manuel was established by a clear <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and </span>convincing evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Salvacion Bodino testified as follows:</p>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

yard, was there anything that happened according to your observation not
ordinary (sic)?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>Manuel Buela also struck him.</u>  (Rollo, pp. 77-78; underlining ours)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The testimony of Salvacion Bodino was corroborated by Adalia
Maduro and Adela Brito, a neighbor of the Bodinos (TSN, June 29, 1989, pp.
15-16).</p>

<p class="BODY">Abuse of superior strength, treachery and evident premeditation
were alleged as qualifying circumstances in the information filed against
appellants.</p>

<p class="BODY">Abuse of superior strength is a relative factor and depends upon
circumstances other than mere numerical superiority of the aggressors.  Such factor may be correctly appreciated by
the trial court only after a searching inquiry (People v. Flores, 40 SCRA 230
[1971]).  There is no evidence to show
that the three appellants assaulted Bodino in such a way as to secure advantage
from their combined strength (People v. Ybañez, 56 SCRA 210 [1974]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither was there evidence to establish treachery.  Before treachery can be appreciated
correctly, there must be a clear and positive showing that the victim was
completely defenseless when killed by his assailants or was unaware of the
assault on his person (People v. Muñoz, 170 SCRA 107 [1989]; People v. Molato,
170 SCRA 640 [1989]).</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no way to conclude that treachery attended the killing
of Bodino.  The fact that the attack was
sudden as found by the trial court is not enough to establish treachery (People
v. Sabanal, 172 SCRA 430 [1989]).  How
sudden was "sudden"?  What is
decisive is that the attack was executed in such a manner as to make it
impossible for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the victim to retaliate
(People v. Bustos, 171 SCRA 243 [1989]).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The record is bereft of evidence showing the methods or the means
employed by appellants in order to ensure their safety from any retaliation
that could be put up by their victim.</p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, there was no evidence to establish evident
premeditation.  When there is no showing
as to how and when the plan to kill was hatched or what time had elapsed before
it was carried out, evident premeditation cannot be considered to exist (People
v. Narit, 197 SCRA 334 [1991]).  To show
premeditation, it is required that the criminal intent be evidenced by notorious
acts evincing determination to commit the same.  The criminal intent must be evident, not merely suspected, or
merely thought of or contemplated mentally without an externalized act (People
v. Legarto, 196 SCRA 611 [1991]).</p>

<p class="BODY">There was no substantial interval of time sufficient to afford
appellants a full opportunity for reflection, between the wounding of Ricardo
which happened at noon (assuming that such wounding was the provocation that
triggered the aggression of appellants) and the killing, which took place an
hour or two later (People v. Tachado, 170 SCRA 611 [1989]).</p>

<p class="BODY">The crime committed by appellants is Homicide as defined under
Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code and penalized by <u>reclusion temporal</u>.  There being no mitigating nor aggravating
circumstance present, the penalty of <u>reclusion temporal</u> shall be imposed
in its medium period or an imprisonment of fourteen (14) years, eight (8)
months and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">one (1) day to seventeen
(17) years and four (4) months.  While
the crime was committed by three persons who were all armed, the aggravating
circumstance of the crime having been committed with the aid of armed men under
Article 14(8) of the Revised Penal Code cannot be appreciated in this case
because the three accused acted under the same plan and for the same purpose
(People v. Pring, 63 Phil. 546 [1936]; People v. Candado, 84 SCRA 508 [1978]).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the minimum term that
can be imposed on appellants shall be within the range of six (6) years and one
(1) day to twelve (12) years.</p>

<p class="BODY">The civil indemnity ordered by the trial court to be paid by the
appellants to the legal heirs of the deceased in the amount of P30,000.00 is
increased to P50,000.00, conformably with the present policy of this Court
(People v. Yeban, 190 SCRA 409 [1990]).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, this Court finds appellants guilty only of
Homicide and sentences them to suffer the indeterminate penalty of seven (7)
years and one (1) day of <u>prision mayor</u> to fourteen (14) years, eight (8)
months and one (1) day of <u>reclusion temporal</u>; and to indemnify jointly
and severally, the heirs of Bienvenido Bodino in the amount of P50,000.00.  As thus MODIFIED, the judgment of the trial
court is AFFIRMED.  No pronouncement as
to costs.</p>
