failure to appear at the hearing set on September 2, 1983 -- during which for

a failure to prosecute or a failure to comply with the rules or with an order
of the court below on the part of the plaintiff within the contemplation of
Rule 17, Section 3, <u>supra</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondent court rejected the petitioners' contention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It held that pre-trial was set by the <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pasig</span></st1:place></st1:city> court for <st1:date year="1982" day="29" month="3">29 March 1982</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">However,
petitioners were </span>declared in default; it was at that stage that the
requirement of Section 1, Rule 20 of the Rules of Court was deemed to have been
complied with, and what was subsequently set by the <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>
court, first on 24 June 1983 and then on 2 September 1983 upon a so-called
"Notice of Hearing/Pre-Trial Conference," "was and should have
been a hearing and not a pre-trial," considering "that at that
particular stage (on September 2, 1983) all of the pleadings had already been
submitted by the parties and plaintiff had already adduced its evidence."
Furthermore, it was held in <span class="SpellE"><u>Jalover</u></span> <u>vs.</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>Ytoriaga</u></span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></u></span></a>
that where the plaintiff had already adduced evidence and rested its case
before the dismissal of said case, the absence of the plaintiff at a subsequent
hearing cannot be considered a failure to prosecute on plaintiffs' part; it can
only be construed as a waiver of the right to cross-examine the witnesses which
the opposite party might present at the hearing and to object to the
admissibility of the evidence of the latter.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">The principal issue in this case is whether or not the <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> <span style="">court's </span>order
of 2 September 1983 dismissing <span class="SpellE">IFC's</span> complaint for
failure to appear on said date had long become final such that it was error for
the former to issue its order of 25 February 1985 granting <span class="SpellE">IFC's</span>
27 September 1984 motion (to set aside said order of 2 September 1983 and to
decide the case on the basis of the evidence it earlier presented<span style=""> <i><u>ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span></u></i>
</span>pursuant to the default order of 29 March 1982).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The issue in turn revolves on the propriety
and validity of the said dismissal order.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If such order is valid, then certainly it became final upon the lapse of
fifteen (15) days from receipt thereof by IFC.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Both IFC and petitioners agree that the former received the order on <st1:date year="1983" day="20" month="9">20 September 1983</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, per Section 39 of B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 129, IFC had until <st1:date year="1983" day="5" month="10">5 October 1983</st1:date> within which to either file a motion to
reconsider the order or to appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, if the Order was null
and void, as IFC claims, it never became <span style="">final.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As to be expected, petitioners assert that the Order was valid
since what was set for <st1:date year="1983" day="2" month="9">2 September 1983</st1:date>
was the pre-trial of the case; it was a re-setting of the pre-trial scheduled
on <st1:date year="1983" day="24" month="6">24 June 1983</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the Order of <st1:date year="1983" day="24" month="6">24 June 1983</st1:date> reads:</p>

<blockquote>“By agreement, pre-trial is reset to <st1:date year="1983" day="2" month="9">September 2, 1983</st1:date>.”<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Since IFC accepted the notice of
pre-trial for <st1:date year="1983" day="24" month="6">24 June 1983</st1:date>
and agreed to its re-setting, it is now <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from
claiming that the <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:place></st1:city>
court should not have set the case for pre-trial since one had already been had
on <st1:date year="1982" day="29" month="3">29 March 1982</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners then conclude that since IFC
failed to appear for pre-trial on <st1:date year="1983" day="2" month="9">2
 September 1983</st1:date>, the <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:place></st1:city>
court correctly dismissed the complaint pursuant to Section 2, Rule 20 of the
Rules of Court which provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SECTION 2.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><i><u>Failure</u> </i><i><u><span style="">to</span></u></i><i><span style=""> <u>appear</u> <u>at</u> <u>pre-trial</u> <u>conference</u></span></i><span style="">.</span></span><span style=""> -- </span>A party who fails to appear at a pre-trial conference may be
non-suited or considered as in default."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE">and</span> that such
dismissal amounts to an adjudication on the merits per Section 3, Rule 17 of
the Rules of Court, which reads as<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SECTION 3.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><i><u><span style="">Failure to prosecute</span></u></i><span style="">.</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="GramE">-- ­If plaintiff fails to appear at the time

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Hence, it was error for the <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:place></st1:city> court to set aside this
Order in its <st1:date year="1985" day="25" month="2">25 February 1985</st1:date>
Order on the basis of <span class="SpellE">IFC's</span> <st1:date year="1984" day="27" month="9">27 September 1984</st1:date> manifestation and motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">IFC does not dispute the fact that it <span class="GramE">neither
filed a motion to reconsider or</span> appealed from the order of <st1:date year="1983" day="2" month="9">2 September 1983</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It, however, claims that the <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> court erred in dismissing the case on 2 September
1983 since it had already offered its evidence on 30 March 1982 pursuant to the
default order of 28 March 1982 and that per the Order of 20 May 1982, while the
default order was set aside, the court explicitly stated therein that
"plaintiff's evidence, however, stands." In short, a party cannot be
said "to have failed to prosecute when his evidence is already a part of
the records of the case and the court can decide the case based on the evidence
already presented."<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
It then went on to conclude that the <st1:date year="1983" day="2" month="9">2
 September 1983</st1:date> Order is null and void and a void order is no order
at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, even if it was received
by IFC on <st1:date year="1983" day="20" month="9">20 September 1983</st1:date>,
it never became final and did not produce any legal or binding effect.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

</span>However, after the complaint was amended to include an additional party

<p class="BODY">We went on to say that:</p>

<blockquote>"The scheduling of a second pre-trial after DBP had finished
presenting its evidence frustrated, rather than advanced, the primary purpose
of pre-trials <span style="">of </span>abbreviating
trial by limitation <span style="">and </span>simplification
of the issues, if not indeed of dispensing altogether with the necessity of
trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither is that purpose served <span style="">by </span>non-suiting a plaintiff at such a
stage of the action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The correct course
would have <span style="">been </span>to proceed with
the trial, in fact already well under way, allowing the defendants (private
respondents) to cross-examine the plaintiff's (<span class="SpellE">DBP's</span>)
witnesses and thereafter to offer their evidence."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the present case, it is quite obvious that the <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span> court had <span style="">no </span>intention
of <span class="GramE">reverting</span> the case to its pre-trial stage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <span style="">is
</span>easily borne out by the fact that its Order of 20 May 1982 <span style="">is </span>silent <span style="">as </span>to the prayer in petitioner's motion of 7 April 1982 that
"the case be set for pre-trial conference with due<span style=""> </span>notice to all parties concerned." Moreover, it
subsequently sent a notice of hearing setting the hearing of the case on 15
October 1982, which was reset to 21 January 1983 in the notice dated 11 October
1982.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, while this <span style="">may </span>be <span style="">so, </span>the parties herein and the <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>
court failed to fully comprehend the <span style="">situation,
which could have been due to the transfer of the case </span>from the <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span> court and their <span style="">failure
</span>to examine the records.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, it is not clear whether the <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>
court initially set the case for pre-trial or for hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The heading of its 20 April 1983 Notice is
rather vague, if not misleading.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
reads "Notice of Hearing/Pre-Trial Conference." But, as the
respondent court noted, its body refers to a setting of the "hearing of
the case" on 24 June 1983.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
Its personnel in charge of notices may have used the mimeographed blank forms
but forgot to cancel the inappropriate words in the heading.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any case, the parties considered the
notice as one for pre-trial for, on 24 June 1983, due to the absence of the
third-party defendant, IFC and the petitioners agreed to reset the <u><span style="">pre-trial</span></u><span style=""> </span>to 2 September 1983 and the court issued the corresponding
order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In essence, therefore, the
parties in this case had voluntarily agreed that the case be set anew <span style="">for </span>pre-trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>
court, by its order, yielded, in effect, to the agreement of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This fact brings this case out of the
doctrine enunciated <span style="">in </span>the <u>Pioneer</u>
and <u>DBP</u><span style=""> </span>cases, and <span class="SpellE">ingrafts</span> an exception thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one can question <span style="">the </span>soundness and wisdom of the doctrine that the pre-trial stage
is completed after a party had been ordered non-suited or declared as in
default, as the case may be, and that an order lifting it does not revert the
action to its pretrial stage, or authorize, much less, a second pre-trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, neither the Rules nor the doctrine
bars the parties from agreeing, after such lifting, to hold a pre-trial and t<span style="">o </span>effectively accomplish its
objectives which could not have been done at the first pre-trial because of the
absence of the plaintiff, resulting in his non-suit, or the absence of the
defendant, resulting <span style="">in </span>his
being declared as in default.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
necessity for a second pre-trial may have been felt by the parties in this case
considering that defendant had a third-party complaint and the third-party
defendant had set up a compulsory counterclaim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At such pre-trial, the parties could consider the matter of an amicable
settlement, the simplification of the issues and the possibility of obtaining
stipulations or admissions of facts and of documents to avoid unnecessary proof
which would, at the very least, shorten the proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be remembered that the factual milieu
surrounding the default order in this case is entirely different from that in <u><span style="">Pioneer</span></u><span style=""> </span>where the defaulted party attended the first pre-trial and
rejected any amicable settlement of the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u><span style="">DBP</span></u><span style=""> </span>involved the non-suit at the second
pre-trial of a party which had already adduced its evidence <i><u>ex-</u></i><span class="SpellE"><i><u><span style="">parte</span></u></i></span>
at the first pre-trial after defendant was declared in default and was present
at the second pre-trial; <u><span style="">DBP</span></u><span style=""> </span>was declared non-suited simply because
the authority of its representative was challenged.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Elsewise</span> stated, IFC had waived the
effect of the lifting of the order of default and had voluntarily agreed to
have another pre-trial.</p>

reconsideration <span style="">or appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Y<span style="">et, it did nothing until 27 September 1984,

case on the basis of the evidence it had presented </span><span style="">on </span><span style="">30 March 1982.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Undoubtedly, at the time it filed the manifestation and motion,
the 2 September 1983 order <span style="">had </span>long
become final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither appeal nor a
petition for relief from judgment was available to IFC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> court
had lost jurisdiction over the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
had no authority <span style="">to </span>modify, annul
or set aside the final order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once a
decision becomes final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, it is removed
from the power and jurisdiction of the court which rendered it to further alter
or amend it, much less revoke it.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
This doctrine of finality of judgment is grounded on fundamental considerations
of public policy and sound practice that at the risk of occasional error, the
judgments of the courts must become final at some<span style=""> </span>definite date fixed by law.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
To allow courts to amend final judgments will result in endless litigation.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing discussions are more than sufficient to abort the
theory of IFC that the Order of 2 September 1983 was null and void and never
had any binding effect because it had already presented its evidence and, per <span class="SpellE"><u>Jalover</u></span> <u>vs.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Ytoriaga</u></span>,
<u>supra</u>., such <span style="">a </span>party can
not be considered to have failed to prosecute <span class="SpellE"><u>Jalover</u></span>

<p class="BODY">The conclusion <span class="GramE">We</span> have reached may be
harsh on IFC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, it is quite clear

receipt of the dismissal order of 2 September 1983.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It slept too long on whatever right it
