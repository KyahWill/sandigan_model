Barangay Owaon, Dapitan City, Felicisimo Diniay and the rest of his household
were roused from their sleep by someone calling from outside their house,
urging Felicisimo to come down: "<i>Naog diha, tiyo</i>." (Visayan
for "Come down, uncle.") When the call was repeated, Felicisimo got
up, lighted a kerosene lamp and prepared to go downstairs to talk to the
callers.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Felicisimo Diniay's son, Bienvenido, peering through a window,
saw seven (7) men in two groups.  The
first group, numbering four, was positioned in front of the stairs of the
house.  The second group, three in
number, stood about five meters away from the first.  By the light of the moon, Bienvenido recognized the seven
persons.  In the first group were Roger
Parangan, Zosimo Paglinawan, Jaime Bendano, and Felipe Ponggan; in the second,
Sabino Alaban, Alberto Semil and Luciano Jamarolin.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Leaving the lighted kerosene lamp behind, Felicisimo proceeded to
the stairs.  As he emerged from the
house and stood at the top of the stairway, Roger Parangan and appellant Felipe
Ponggan suddenly began firing their guns at him.  Felicisimo was hit in the forehead and in the right portion of
the stomach just below the breast (as revealed by the post-mortem examination
conducted later by the municipal health officer, Dr. Hannibal Adaza),<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>

<blockquote>"IT IS SO ORDERED."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence this appeal, brought to this Court by Felipe Ponggan, who
assigns one error to the Court <i>a quo, viz</i>.:</p>

<blockquote>"THE COURT A QUO GRAVELY ERRED IN
CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF THE CRIME CHARGED DESPITE THE ABSENCE OF
EVIDENCE REQUIRED TO PROVE HIS GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A thoroughgoing evaluation of the briefs in relation to the evidence
on record convinces the Court that the trial court's judgment is in accord with
the law and the proofs.  The evidence of
the prosecution does indeed generate the requisite moral certainty of the
appellant's guilt of the crime charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main defense put up is alibi.  Ponggan testified that on April 25, 1985, he was in his place of
residence in Canibungan, Roxas, Zamboanga del Norte, and remained there until
two days later to do some farming work; and that while he used to live in
Owaon, he had moved to and established residence in Canibungan in 1980 when he
got married.  He further declared that
since 1982, until his arrest in connection with this case in 1987, he was one
of the barangay councilmen of Canibungan.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Corroboration of Ponggan's alibi was essayed by defense witness
Geronimo Arunda, barangay captain of Canibungan since 1987.  Arunda testified that Ponggan was really in
Canibungan in the morning of April 26, 1985, supervising some barangay civic project,
and that he (Arunda) saw him (Ponggan) in the afternoon of the same day, as
well as two days afterward.  Arunda
further deposed that he well remembered Ponggan's participation in the civic
project because he kept a log book of those who participated therein, duly
signed by him.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's defense of alibi cannot prevail over the positive
affirmations of no less than three prosecution witnesses, namely:  Bienvenido Diniay, Ernesto Saguin and
Alberto Semil, all of whom pinpointed him as one of the perpetrators of the
crime.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Government's principal witness, Bienvenido Diniay, the son of
the victim, Felicisimo, categorically stated that he saw appellant Felipe
Ponggan and Roger Parangan shoot and kill his father, with handguns.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
He asserted that he was able to recognize his father's assailants because it
was a moonlit night,<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a> and
he had known them long before the killing took place, they being all residents
of Owaon, Dapitan City, except for Jaime Bendano.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's co-accused, Alberto Semil, who was discharged to be a
state witness, as above stated, also gave evidence directly linking Ponggan to
the murder and belying his alibi.  His
testimony corroborated Bienvenido Diniay's eyewitness declarations.  He testified as regards details which could
have been known only to Ponggan and those actually present at the time of the
slaying of Felicisimo Diniay, i.e., that he and his companions were there in
the place of the incident because "they had a mission to execute;"<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
that it was Ponggan who had called out to Felicisimo, "<i>Naog diha, tiyo</i>"
(Come down, uncle), an invitation seconded by Parangan; that at that time only
Ponggan and Parangan were armed, having in their possession, respectively, a
.38 caliber revolver and a .22 local magnum;<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a> that
when Felicisimo started to go down the stairs, he was met by a gunshot followed
by another, the first being louder than the second; and that thereafter, the
three men composing the second group:  Alaban, Jamarolin and he (witness Alberto Semil), ran away leaving Parangan,
Paglinawan, Bendano and appellant Ponggan behind.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Another prosecution witness, Ernesto Saguin, gave testimony
affirmatively establishing the presence of Ponggan in barangay Owaon, Dapitan
City, about two hours before the commission of the crime.  Saguin, a resident of Owaon, declared that on
April 26, 1985, at around six o'clock in the evening, he saw Ponggan and Zosimo
Paglinawan pass by the front of his house; that later that evening he heard two
gunshots coming from the direction of the victim's house, a kilometer away; and
that he subsequently learned that Felicisimo Diniay was killed that particular
night.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This Court thus sustains the following findings and conclusions
of the Trial Court rejecting appellant's defense of alibi.</p>

<blockquote>"The Court finds unimpressive accused's defense of alibi:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He claims he was in
Canibungan to do some farming work, but his supposed corroborating witness,
Geronimo Arunda declared he supervised and participated in the barangay civic
action.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Arunda's claim that
he kept a logbook with his signature authenticating it (in) which he listed the
participants in the civic action on April 26, 1985 is undeserving of belief
because at that time, he had no control, much less, power over barangay
activities, having assumed as barangay captain thereof only in 1987, which was
some two years later.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Arunda, already the
barangay captain of Canibungan when he testified on December 14, 1988, declared
that the keeping of a logbook showing participants in the civic action,
strangers coming in, as well as barangay inhabitants who leave and return, is a
regular practice.  He even said it is
Elisa Tobli who now takes charge of the logbook replacing Godofredo Mamanda as
barangay secretary.  But the defense,
knowing fully well its shaky defense did not present the logbook as
demonstrative evidence (Rule 130, Sec. 1(4).  It could not be existing after all."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Alibi is indeed one of the weakest defense (sic) an accused can
invoke.  Easily lending itself to
concoction it must invariably be viewed with suspicion, and may be considered
only when established by positive and clear satisfactory evidence (People vs.
Gapasin, 145 SCRA 178; People vs. Munoz, G.R. 61152, Jul. 29, 1988)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The rule is that the defense of alibi, in order to be given full
faith and credit, must be clearly established and must not leave any room for
doubt as to its plausibility and verity.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
Appellant Ponggan's alibi, supported as it is by proof less than credible,
cannot overturn the prosecution's positive evidence demonstrating beyond
reasonable doubt that he participated in the killing of Felicisimo Diniay.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to Ponggan's contention that it is the affidavit of
witness Bienvenido Diniay -- containing the general and ambiguous statement
that it was the "group" who killed his father -- that should be given
credence rather than his testimony in open court -- mentioning for the first
time that, specifically, it was Felipe Ponggan and Roger Parangan who were his
father's assailants -- suffice it to say that affidavits taken <i>ex-parte</i>
are inferior to testimony given in court, the former being almost invariably
incomplete and often inaccurate.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Ponggan's contention that Alberto Semil is a perjured witness and
that his testimony was tailored to strengthen the weak case of the prosecution,
is not well taken.  It will be noted
that Semil, appellant's co-accused who was discharged to be a state witness,
not only withstood the test of cross-examination, but his testimony was also
substantially corroborated by those of the other two prosecution witnesses,
Diniay and Saguin.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ponggan was positively identified by witnesses whose testimonies,
according the trial court,<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a> were
"natural and in accord with the normal course of events."<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
No ill-motive has been shown for the prosecution witnesses to give false
evidence against appellant.  The mere fact
that witness Bievenido Diniay is a relative of the victim is not sufficient
warrant to disregard his testimony nor does it render the same less worthy of
credit, it being important to stress that his identification of Ponggan as one
of the assailants was positive and reliable.<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court likewise agrees with the lower court's finding that the
killing of Felicisimo Diniay was attended by treachery and evident
premeditation.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is treachery when the offender adopts means, methods or forms
in the execution of the felony which insure its commission without risk to
himself arising from any defense which the offended party might make.<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
In the present case, the victim, who was not armed, was shot and killed after
he opened the door of his house and was just about to descend the stairs,
without any inkling whatever that he was going to be met with bullets and in
all probability not yet fully awake.  The mode of attack thus appears to have been deliberately adopted by his
assailants to ensure the commission of the crime without risk to themselves
arising from the defense which Felicisimo might have offered.  Clearly, treachery was present.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, evident premeditation exists when the
execution of the criminal act is preceded by cool thought and reflection upon
the resolution to carry out the criminal intent, during a space of time
sufficient to arrive at a calm judgment.<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
Although there is no adequate showing of the source of the "mission"
note which Efren Saguin handed to Alberto Semil, there was no refutation of his
(Semil's) testimony that when he and Sabino Alaban arrived at the house of
Albino Jamarolin -- uncle of discharged co-accused Juciano Jamarolin --, Roger
Parangan, Zosimo Paglinawan, Jaime Bendano and appellant Felipe Ponggan, were
already there, and it was appellant Ponggan who led and directed them towards
the house of the victim.  Thus, there is
persuasive showing of evident premeditation and Ponggan's participation in the
criminal "mission" or design.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, where treachery has already been taken into account to
qualify the crime as murder, evident premeditation should be considered only as
a generic aggravating circumstance.<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
There being therefore one attendant aggravating circumstance attending the
felony of murder, not offset by any mitigating circumstance, the proper penalty
is death, which should nonetheless be modified to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> by
virtue of the 1987 Constitution.<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the other aggravating circumstances of use of superior
strength and nighttime, the Court upholds the trial court's conclusion that
these circumstances, although present, cannot be considered as separate
aggravating circumstances because they are absorbed in treachery.<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the Court finds the trial court's award of damages justified
by the facts proven by the evidence.  However, conformably with prevailing jurisprudence, the amount of civil
indemnity for death should be raised from P30,000.00 to P50,000.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Decision of the Trial Court is hereby
AFFIRMED, except as to the death indemnity which is hereby raised to
P50,000.00.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
