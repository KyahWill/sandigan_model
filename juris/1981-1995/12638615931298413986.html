Rules of Court seeking the annulment of the decision of the respondent National
Labor Relations Commission dated June 17, 1986 (p. 23, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>)
in NLRC NCR Case No. 6-2158-84 entitled "Nestor <span class="SpellE">Malabanan</span>

the decision of the Labor Arbiter which dismissed the complaint for illegal
dismissal for lack of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent <span class="SpellE">Malabanan</span> was employed by
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Rubberworld</span> (<span class="SpellE">Phils</span>.),
Inc. on <st1:date year="1978" day="25" month="9">September 25, 1978</st1:date>
as an ordinary clerk.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In May, 1980, he
was promoted to the position of production scheduler with a corresponding
salary increase.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was again
transferred to the Inventory Control Section as stock clerk on <st1:date year="1983" day="1" month="9">September 1, 1983</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="6" month="4">April 6, 1984</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> <st1:state><st1:place>Hidalgo</st1:place></st1:state>,
the Plant I General Manager of <span class="GramE">petitioner company</span>,
received a copy of the Financial Audit Report from the Internal Audit
Department of the company showing a significant material variance between the
year-end actual inventory and that of the Cards (SC)/EDP Control Records.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a result thereof, Noel Santiago, Section
Head of the Inventory Control Section, where respondent <span class="SpellE">Malabanan</span>
was assigned, conducted an investigation of the reported discrepancies in the
stock cards upon the request of the Plant General Manager.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city>
then submitted his report to the general manager recommending the dismissal of
respondent <span class="SpellE">Malabanan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, <span class="SpellE">Malabanan's</span> case was
endorsed to the Human Resources Division of <span class="GramE">petitioner
company</span>, which conducted a reinvestigation on the matter and which
affirmed the recommendation of the Inventory Control Section Head for the
termination of employment of respondent <span class="SpellE">Malabanan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="6" month="6">June 6, 1984</st1:date>,
respondent <span class="SpellE">Malabanan</span> was dismisses by <span class="GramE">petitioner company</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 16, 1984, respondent <span class="SpellE">Malabanan</span>,
along with another complainant named Jonathan <span class="SpellE">Transmil</span>,
filed a complaint for unfair labor practice and illegal dismissal against
petitioner company alleging that they (respondent <span class="SpellE">Malabanan</span>
and complainant <span class="SpellE">Transmil</span>) were members of the monthly
salaried employees' union affiliated with TUPAS; that petitioner company forced
them to disaffiliate from the union; and that due to their refusal to resign from
the union, they were ultimately dismissed from employment by petitioner
company.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="GramE">company</span> on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">the </span>other hand, denied complainants’
allegations and averred that respondent <span class="SpellE">Malabanan’s</span>
dismissal was due to gross and habitual neglect of his duty and not due to his
union affiliation.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the hearing of the case, the other complainant, Jonathan <span class="SpellE">Transmil</span> withdrew from the case since he already found
another employment abroad.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1985</st1:date>,
the Labor Arbiter rendered a decision (pp. 17-22, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>),
the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, this case should be, as it is
hereby, DISMISSED, for lack of merit.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SO ORDERED."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondent <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

terminated up to actual reinstatement, without loss of seniority rights and
benefits appurtenant thereto.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

23-27, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span></span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner company moved for <span class="GramE">a
reconsideration</span> on the ground that the respondent Commission's decision
is not in accordance with facts and evidence on record.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1986" day="23" month="7">July
 23, 1986</st1:date>, the said motion for reconsideration was denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="3" month="9">September 3, 1986</st1:date>,
petitioner filed the instant petition contending that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">the </span>respondent Commission committed grave abuse of discretion
amounting to lack of jurisdiction <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">in </span>reversing
the Labor Arbiter's decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The two issues to be resolved in the instant case are:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) whether or not the dismissal of
respondent <span class="SpellE">Malabanan</span> is tainted with unfair labor
practice; and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">(2) </span>whether or not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">a </span>just and valid cause exists for the
dismissal of private respondent <span class="SpellE">Malabanan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner alleges that the National Labor Relations Commission
gravely erred in concluding that the demotion of <span class="SpellE">Malabanan</span>
from production scheduler to a stock clerk at the Stock and Inventory Section
was intended to discourage <span class="SpellE">Malabanan</span> from union
membership.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It argued that the Labor
Arbiter was correct in finding that the private respondent had not shown ample
proof to the effect that he was a member of a labor organization prior to his
transfer to another position.</p>

<p class="BODY">We believe that the foregoing contentions are impressed with
merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Art. 248 of the Labor Code, PD
No. 442, as amended, <span class="GramE">provides</span>:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 248.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Unfair labor
practices of employers. - It shall be unlawful for an employer to commit any of
the following unfair labor practices:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:85.05pt;text-indent:-20.25pt">(a) To interfere
with, restrain or coerce employees in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">exercise
of their right to self-organization;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The question of whether an employee was dismissed because of his
union activities is essentially a question of fact as to which the findings of
the administrative agency concerned are conclusive and binding if supported by
substantial evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Substantial
evidence has been defined as such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might
accept as adequate to support a conclusion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It means such evidence which affords a substantial basis from which the
fact in issue can be reasonably inferred (Philippine Metal Foundries, Inc. v.
Court of industrial Relations, et. al., No. <span class="GramE">L-34948-49, </span><st1:date year="1979" day="15" month="5"><span class="GramE">May 15<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
 15.0pt">, </span>1979</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 90 SCRA 135).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The findings of the Labor Arbiter on the
non-existence of unfair labor practice on the part of the company are more in
accord and supported by the evidence submitted by the parties in the instant
case, to wit:</p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">"Complainant had
stated that he was</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">a</span>
member of the monthly salaried employees union affiliated with TUPAS.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He, however, offered no proof to support his
allegation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, no evidence was
presented to prove <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the existence of
such union.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We [note] from </span>the
records that, as the usual practice, in cases like this one, complainant is
usually supported by the union of which he is a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">member.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And ordinarily, the
union itself is <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> as a co-complainant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such circumstances, surprisingly, [are] not
present in this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact,
complainant categorically alleged that he had solicited the services of the
PAFLU Labor Union in filing this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is, indeed, surprising that complainant had to solicit the help of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">labor
union (PAFLU) of which he was not a member instead of soliciting the aid of the
labor union (TUPAS) of which he was allegedly a member.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These circumstances alone [destroy] the
credibility of complainant's allegations." <span class="GramE">(p. 21, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).</span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Nowhere in the records can <span class="GramE">We</span> find that
the company actually performed positive acts to restrain the union
participation of private respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For
one, it is doubtful whether <span class="SpellE">Malabanan</span> was really
engaged in the organization of a labor union affiliated with federation
TUPAS.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The only evidence presented by
him to prove this contention is his affidavit and that of his father.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is therefore, not in accordance with
ordinary experience and common practice that the private respondent pursued his
battle alone, without the aid and support of his co-members in the union and
his federation especially in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">a </span>case
of serious nature as this one involving company intervention with union
activity.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a rule, it is the prerogative of the company to promote,
transfer or even demote its employees to other positions when the interests of
the company reasonably demand it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Unless
there are instances which directly point to interference by the company with
the employees' right to self-organization, the transfer of private respondent
should be considered as within the bounds allowed by law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, although private respondent was
transferred to a lower position, his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">original
rank and salary remained undiminished, which fact was not refuted or questioned
by private respondent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">In </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">view of the foregoing conclusions of the
Labor Arbiter, We are compelled to agree with the latter that the petitioner
company did not </span>commit <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">any
unfair labor practice in transferring and thereafter dismissing private
respondent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The remaining issue to be
resolved on this point is whether the dismissal </span>of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">respondent <span class="SpellE">Malabanan</span>
was for a just and lawful cause.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Article

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Petitioner contends that
private respondent <span class="SpellE">Malabanan</span> was guilty of gross
negligence when he caused the posting of incorrect entries in the stock card
without counter checking the actual movement status of the items at </span>the
warehouse, thereby resulting into unmanageable <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">inaccuracies in the data posted in the stock cards.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respondent Commission correctly ruled:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Penultimately</span>, even assuming for
the sake of argument that herein complainant "posted entries in the stock
card without counter checking the actual movement status of the items at the
warehouse, thereby resulting in an inaccurate posting of data on the stock
cards", to our impression does not constitute as a just cause for
dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Records show that he was only
transferred to the Inventory Control Section on <st1:date year="1983" day="1" month="9">September 1, 1983</st1:date> and was not so familiar and experienced
as a stock clerk, and prior to his transfer, the record shows no derogatory
records in terms of his performance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His
failure to carry out efficiently his duties as a stock clerk is not so gross
and habitual.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words he was not
notoriously negligent to warrant his severance from the service.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Considering that there is nothing on record
that shows that he <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span> defied instructions of
his superior with regards to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">his duties
and that he gained personal benefit of the discrepancy, his dismissal is
unwarranted" (p. 26, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">It does not appear that
private respondent <span class="SpellE">Malabanan</span> is an incorrigible
offender or that what he did inflicted serious damage to the company so much so
that his continuance in the service would be patently inimical to the
employer's interest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Assuming, <u>in</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>gratia</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>argumenti</u></span>
that the private respondent had indeed committed the said mistakes in the
posting of accurate data, this was only his first infraction with regard to </span>his
duties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It would thus be cruel and
unjust to mete out the drastic penalty of dismissal, for it is not
proportionate to the gravity of the misdeed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In fact, the promotion of
the private respondent from the position of ordinary clerk to production
scheduler establishes the presumption that his performance of his work is
acceptable to the company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
petitioner even admitted that it was due to heavy </span>financial and business
reverses that the company assigned the private respondent to the position of
Stock Clerk and not because of his unsatisfactory performance as production
scheduler (p. 6, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It has been held that there must be fair and
reasonable criteria to be used in selecting employees to be dismissed (<span class="SpellE">Asiaworld</span> Publishing House, Inc. v. <span class="SpellE">Ople</span>,
No. <span class="GramE">L-56398, </span><st1:date year="1987" day="23" month="7"><span class="GramE">July 23, 1987</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 152 SCRA 219).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is worthy to note that the prerogative of management to
dismiss or lay-off an employee must be done without abuse of discretion, for
what is at stake is not only petitioner's position, but also his means of
livelihood.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is so because the
preservation of the lives of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the </span>citizens
is a basic duty of the State, more vital than the preservation of corporate
profits (Euro-<span class="SpellE">Linea</span>, <span class="SpellE">Phils</span>.,
Inc. v. NLRC, L-75782, December 1, 1987, 156 SCRA 79).</p>

<p class="BODY">The law regards the worker with compassion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Our society is a compassionate one.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Where a penalty less punitive would suffice,
whatever missteps may be committed by the worker should not be visited by the
supreme penalty of dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is
not only because of the law's concern for the working man.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is in addition, his family to
consider.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After all, labor
determinations should not only be <span class="SpellE"><u>secundum</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u style="text-underline:words">rationem</u></span> but also <span class="SpellE"><u>secundum</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>caritatem</u></span>
