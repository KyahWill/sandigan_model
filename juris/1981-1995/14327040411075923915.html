In 1965, Batjak's financial condition deteriorated to the point of bankruptcy. As of that year, Batjak's indebtedness to some private banks and to the Philippine National Bank (PNB) amounted to P11,915,000.00, shown as follows:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td width="30%">Republic Bank </td><td style="text-align: right;" width="15%">P2,324,000.00</td><td width="64%">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td style="text-align: right;"><br></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Philippine Commercial and Industrial Bank </td><td style="text-align: right;">1,346,000.00</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td style="text-align: right;"><br></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Manila Banking Corporation</td><td style="text-align: right;"> 2,000,000.00</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td style="text-align: right;"><br></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Manufacturers Bank</td><td style="text-align: right;"> 440,000.00</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td style="text-align: right;"><br></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation </td><td style="text-align: right;">250,000.00</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td style="text-align: right;"><br></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Foreign Export Advances </td><td style="text-align: right;">555,000.00</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">(against immediate shipment) </div></td><td style="text-align: right;"><br></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td style="text-align: right;"><br></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>PNB export advance line</td><td style="text-align: right;">&nbsp; <u>5,000.000.00</u></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">(against immediate shipment)</div></td><td><div align="center"></div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL..................................</td><td style="text-align: right;"> P11,915,000.00</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>As security for the payment of its obligations and advances against shipments, Batjak mortgaged its three (3) coco-processing oil mills in Sasa, Davao City, Jimenez, Misamis Occidental and Tanauan, Leyte to Manila Banking Corporation (Manila bank), Republic Bank (RB), and Philippine Commercial and Industrial Bank (PCIB), respectively. In need for additional operating capital to place the three (3) coco-processing mills at their optimum capacity and maximum efficiency and to settle, pay or otherwise liquidate pending financial obligations with the different private banks, Batjak applied to PNB for additional financial assistance.

Under said Agreement, NIDC would, as it actually did, invest P6,722,500.00 in Batjak in the form of preferred shares of stock convertible within five (5) years at par into common stock, to liquidate Batjak's obligations to Republic Bank (RB), Manufacturers Bank and Trust Company (MBTC) and Philippine Commercial &amp; Industrial Bank (PCIB), and the balance of the investment was to be applied to Batjak's past due account of P5 million with the PNB.<br><br>Upon receiving payment, RB, PCIB, and MBTC released in favor of PNB the first and any mortgages they held on the properties of Batjak.<br><br>As agreed, PNB also granted Batjak an export-advance line of P3 million, later increased to P5 million, and a standby letter of credit facility in the amount of P5,850,000.00.

To secure the advance, Batjak mortgaged the oil mill in Sasa, Davao City to NIDC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Next, a Voting Trust Agreement was executed on 26 October 1965 in favor of NIDC by the stockholders representing 60% of the outstanding paid-up and subscribed shares of Batjak.

The remedy of the aggrieved party in a denied motion to dismiss is to file an answer and interpose, as defense or defenses, the objection or objections raised by him in said motion to dismiss, then proceed to trial and, in case of adverse decision, to elevate the entire case by appeal in due course. However, under certain situations, recourse to the extraordinary legal remedies of <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition and <i><i>mandamus</i></i> to question the denial of a motion to dismiss or quash is considered proper, in the interest of more enlightened and substantial justice. As the Court said in <i>Pineda and Ampil Manufacturing Co. vs. Bartoiome</i>, 95 Phil. 930, 938:<br><blockquote>"For analogous reasons it may be said that the petition for <i>certiorari</i> interposed by the accused against the order of the court <i>a quo</i> denying the motion to quash may be entertained, not only because it was rendered in a criminal case, but because it was rendered, as claimed, with grave abuse of discretion, as found by the Court of Appeals. xxx."<br></blockquote>and reiterated in <i>Mead v. Argel</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> citing <i>Yap v. Lutero</i> (105 Phil. 1307):<br><blockquote>"However, were we to require adherence to this pretense, the case at bar would have to be dismissed and petitioner required to go through the inconvenience, not to say the mental agony and torture, of submitting himself to trial on the merits in Case No. 166443, apart from the expenses incidental thereto, despite the fact that his trial and conviction therein would violate one of this [<i>sic</i>] constitutional rights, and that, an appeal to this Court, we would, therefore, have to set aside the judgment of conviction of the lower court. This would, obviously, be most unfair and unjust. Under the circumstances obtaining in the present case, the flaw in the procedure followed by petitioner herein may be overlooked, in the interest of a more enlightened and substantial justice."<br></blockquote>Thus, where there is patent grave abuse of discretion, in denying the motion to dismiss, as in the present case, this Court may entertain the petition for <i>certiorari</i> interposed by the party against whom the said order is issued.<br><br>In their motion to dismiss Batjak's complaint, in Civil Case No. 14452, NIDC and PNB raised common grounds for its allowance, to wit:<br><blockquote><ol><li>This Honorable Court (the trial court) has no jurisdiction over the subject of the action or suit;<br><br></li><li>The venue is improperly laid; and<br><br></li><li>Plaintiff has no legal capacity to sue.<br></li></ol></blockquote>In addition, PNB contended that the complaint states no cause of action (Rule 16, Sec. 1, Par. a, c, d &amp; g, Rules of Court).<br><br>Anent the first ground, it is a well-settled rule that the jurisdiction of a Court of First Instance to issue a writ of preliminary or permanent injunction is confined within the boundaries of the province where the land in controversy is situated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> The petition for <i>mandamus</i> of Batjak prayed that NIDC and PNB be ordered to surrender, relinquish and turnover to Batjak the assets, management and operation of Batjak particularly the three (3) oil mills located in Sasa, Davao City, Jimenez, Misamis Occidental and Tanauan, Leyte.<br><br>Clearly, what Batjak asked of respondent court was the exercise of power or authority outside its jurisdiction.<br><br>On the matter of proper venue, Batjak's complaint should have been filed in the provinces where said oil mills are located. Under Rule 4, Sec. 2, paragraph A of the Rules of Court, "actions affecting title to, or for recovery of possession, or for partition or condemnation of, or foreclosure of mortgage on, real property, shall be commenced and tried in the province where the property or any part thereof lies."<br><br>In support of the third ground of their motion to dismiss, PNB and NIDC contend that Batjak's complaint for <i>mandamus</i> is based on its claim or right to recovery of possession of the three (3) oil mills, on the ground of an alleged breach of fiduciary relationship. Noteworthy is the fact that, in the Voting Trust Agreement, the parties thereto were NIDC and certain stockholders of Batjak. Batjak itself was not a signatory thereto. Under Sec. 2, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court, every action must be prosecuted and defended in the name of the real party-in-interest. Applying the rule in the present case, the action should have been filed by the stockholders of Batjak, who executed the Voting Trust Agreement with NIDC, and not by Batjak itself which is not a party to said agreement, and therefore, not the real party-in-interest in the suit to enforce the same.<br><br>In addition, PNB claims that Batjak has no cause of action and prays that the petition for <i>mandamus</i> be dismissed. A careful reading of the Voting Trust Agreement shows that PNB was really not a party thereto. Hence, <i>mandamus</i> will not lie against PNB.<br><br>Moreover, the action instituted by Batjak before the respondent court was a special civil action for <i>mandamus</i> with prayer for preliminary mandatory injunction. Generally, <i>mandamus</i> is not a writ of right and its allowance or refusal is a matter of discretion to be exercised on equitable principles and in accordance with well-settled rules of law, and that it should never be used to effectuate an injustice, but only to prevent a failure of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> The writ does not issue as a matter of course. It will issue only where there is a clear legal right sought to be enforced. It will not issue to enforce a doubtful right. A clear legal right within the meaning of Sec. 3, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court means a right clearly founded in or granted by law, a right which is enforceable as a matter of law.<br><br>Applying the above-cited principles of law in the present case, the Court finds no clear right in Batjak to be entitled to the writ prayed for. It should be noted that the petition for <i>mandamus</i> filed by it prayed that NIDC and PNB be ordered to surrender, relinquish and turn-over to Batjak the assets, management, and operation of Batjak particularly the three (3) oil mills and to make the order permanent, after trial, and ordering NIDC and PNB to submit a complete accounting of the assets, management and operation of Batjak from 1965. In effect, what Batjak seeks to recover is title to, or possession of, real property (the three (3) oil mills which really made up the assets of Batjak) but which the records show already belong to NIDC. It is not disputed that the mortgages on the three (3) oil mills were foreclosed by PNB and NIDC and acquired by them as the highest bidder in the appropriate foreclosure sales. Ownership thereto was subsequently consolidated by PNB and NIDC, after Batjak failed to exercise its right of redemption. The three (3) oil mills are now titled in the name of NIDC. From the foregoing, it is evident that Batjak had no clear right to be entitled to the writ prayed for. In <i>Lamb vs. Philippines</i> (22 Phil. 456) citing the case of <i>Gonzales V. Salazar vs. The Board of Pharmacy</i>, 20 Phil. 367, the Court said that the writ of <i>mandamus</i> will not issue to give to the applicant anything to which he is not entitled by law.<br><br>2.<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><i>On the appointment of receiver</i>.<br><br>A receiver of real or personal property, which is the subject of the action, may be appointed by the court when it appears from the pleadings that the party applying for the appointment of receiver has an interest in said property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> The right, interest, or claim in property, to entitle one to a receiver over it, must be present and existing.<br><br>As borne out by the records of the case, PNB acquired ownership of two (2) of the three (3) oil mills by virtue of mortgage foreclosure sales. NIDC acquired ownership of the third oil mill also under a mortgage foreclosure sale. Certificates of title were issued to PNB and NIDC after the lapse of the one (1) year redemption period. Subsequently, PNB transferred the ownership of the two (2) oil mills to NIDC. There can be no doubt, therefore, that NIDC not only has possession of, but also title to the three (3) oil mills formerly owned by Batjak. The interest of Batjak over the three (3) oil mills ceased upon the issuance of the certificates of title to PNB and NIDC confirming their ownership over the said properties. More so, where Batjak does not impugn the validity of the foreclosure proceedings. Neither Batjak nor its stockholders have instituted any legal proceedings to annul the mortgage foreclosure sales aforementioned.<br><br>Batjak premises its right to the possession of the three (3) oil mills on the Voting Trust Agreement, claiming that under said agreement, NIDC was constituted as trustee of the assets, management and operations of Batjak, that due to the expiration of the Voting Trust Agreement, on 26 October 1970, NIDC should turn over the assets of the three (3) oil mills to Batjak.<br><br>The relevant provisions of the Voting Trust Agreement, particularly paragraph 4 &amp; No. 1 thereof, are hereby reproduced:<br><blockquote>"NOW THEREFORE, the undersigned stockholders, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained and to carry out the foregoing purposes in order to vest in the TRUSTEE the voting rights of the shares of stock held by the undersigned in the CORPORATION as hereinafter stated it is mutually agreed as follows:<br><br>"1. PERIOD OF DESIGNATION — For a period of five (5) years from and after date hereof, without power of revocation on the part of the SUBSCRIBERS, the TRUSTEE designated in the manner herein provided is hereby made, constituted and appointed as a VOTING TRUSTEE to act for and in the name of the SUBSCRIBERS, it being understood, however, that this Voting Trust Agreement shall, upon its expiration be subject to a re-negotiation between the parties, as may be warranted by the balance and attending circumstance of the loan investment of the TRUSTEE or otherwise in the CORPORATION.<br></blockquote>and No. 3 thereof reads:<br><blockquote>"3. VOTING POWER OF TRUSTEE — The TRUSTEE and its successors in trust, if any, shall have the power and it shall be its duty to vote the shares of the undersigned subject hereof and covered by this Agreement at all annual, adjourned and special meetings of the CORPORATION on all questions, motions, resolutions and matters including the election of directors and all such matters on which the stockholders, by virtue of the by-laws of the CORPORATION and of the existing legislations are entitled to vote, which may be voted upon at any and all said meetings and shall also have the power to execute and acknowledge any agreements or documents that may be necessary in its opinion to express the consent or assent of all or any of the stockholders of the CORPORATION with respect to any matter or thing to which any consent or assent of the stockholders may be necessary, proper or convenient."<br></blockquote>From the foregoing provisions, it is clear that what was assigned to NIDC was the power to vote the shares of stock of the stockholders of Batjak, representing 60% of Batjak's outstanding shares, and who are the signatories to the agreement. The power entrusted to NIDC also included the authority to execute any agreement or document that may be necessary to express the consent or assent to any matter, by the stockholders. Nowhere in the said provisions or in any other part of the Voting Trust Agreement is mention made of any transfer or assignment to NIDC of Batjak's assets, operations, and management. NIDC was constituted as trustee only of the voting rights of 60% of the paid-up and outstanding shares of stock in Batjak. This is confirmed by paragraph No. 9 of the same Voting Trust Agreement, thus:<br><blockquote>"9. TERMINATION — Upon termination of this Agreement as heretofore provided, the certificates delivered to the TRUSTEE by virtue hereof shall be returned and delivered to the undersigned stockholders as the absolute owners thereof, upon surrender of their respective voting trust certificates, and the duties of the TRUSTEE shall ceased and terminate."<br></blockquote>Under the aforecited provision, what was to be returned by NIDC as trustee to Batjak's stockholders, upon the termination of the agreement, are the certificates of shares of stock belonging to Batjak's stockholders, not the properties or assets of Batjak itself which were never delivered, in the first place to NIDC, under the terms of said Voting Trust Agreement.<br><br>In any event, a voting trust transfers only voting or other rights pertaining to the shares subject of the agreement, or control over the stock. The law on the matter is Section 59, paragraph 1 of the Corporation Code (BP 68) which provides:<br><blockquote>"Sec. 59. Voting Trusts — One or more stockholders of a stock corporation may create a voting trust for the purpose of conferring upon a trustee or trusties the right to vote and other rights pertaining to the shares for a period not exceeding five (5) years at any one time; x x x"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br></blockquote>The acquisition by PNB-NIDC of the properties in question was not made or effected under the capacity of a trustee but as a foreclosing creditor for the purpose of recovering on a just and valid obligation of Batjak.<br><br>Moreover, the prevention of imminent danger to property is the guiding principle that governs courts in the matter of appointing receivers. Under Sec. 1 (b), Rule 59 of the Rules of Court, it is necessary in granting the relief of receivership that the property or fund be in danger of loss, removal or material injury.<br><br>In the case at bar, Batjak in its petition for receivership, or in its amended petition therefor, failed to present any evidence to establish the requisite condition that the property is in danger of being lost, removed or materially injured unless a receiver is appointed to guard and preserve it.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petitions are<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><i>GRANTED</i>.
