				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BIDIN, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This petition for <i>certiorari</i> with preliminary injunction
and/or restraining order seeks to reverse and set aside:  (a) the May 29, 1981 Resolution of the
National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) dismissing the appeal of the
Philippine-Singapore Ports Corporation (PSPC) from the Decision of the Labor
Arbiter dated January 3, 1980 ordering PSPC to pay Perfecto Jardin the sum of
$3,800.00 or its peso equivalent at the current rate of exchange representing
the latter's wages for the un­expired portion of <span style="">his </span>employment contract, and (b) the February 9, 1984 Resolution
of the NLRC <u>en banc</u> denying PSPC's motion for the reconsideration of its
earlier Resolution.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of the case are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">PSPC is a corporation organized and existing under Philippine laws.  On September 5, 1977, PSPC and Jardin
entered into a contract of employment wherein the latter was employed by the
former as a winchman/signalman at the Commercial Islamic Port of Jeddah in
Saudi Arabia for a two-year period commencing in January, 1978.  On or about October 18,<span style=""> </span>1978, the PSPC Medical Director
recommended that Jardin be given priority in the schedule for rest and
recreation (R and R) leave as he was diagnosed to be in need of a fistulectomy
due to "fistula in anu."</p>

<p class="BODY">Jardin was sent back to the Philippines at PSPC's expense for
medical treatment.  At the GSIS
Hospital, Quezon City where he was treated and confined, his ailment was
diagnosed as "pruritis ani due to ancylostomiasis." On November 4,
1978, Jardin was certified as fit to work by his attending physician at the
said hospital.  When he reported to the
PSPC on the same day, however, he was advised to file his resignation papers.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, on January 31, 1979, Jardin filed with the then Ministry of
Labor, Region IV, Manila, a complaint for illegal dismissal and recovery of
backwages (R4-STF-1-787-79).  In its
position paper, the PSPC prayed for the dismissal of the complaint principally
on the ground that under Art. 15 of the Labor Code (P.D. No. 442), the Bureau
of Employment Services and not the Labor Arbiter had jurisdiction over the case
because it involved the overseas employment of a Filipino worker.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his decision <span style="">of </span>January
3, 1980, Labor Arbiter Daniel M. Lucas, Jr. did not pass upon the issue of
jurisdiction.  He resolved the case on
its merits and disposed of it as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, respondent corporation is hereby ordered to pay
complainant the sum of $3,800.00 or, its equivalent in Peso, Philippine
Currency, at the current rate of exchange, representing the latter's wages for
the unexpired portion of his employment contract.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SO ORDERED." (Rollo, p. 29).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In its appeal filed with the NLRC on February 19, 1980, PSPC
reiterated its contention that it is the Bureau of Employment Services that has
jurisdiction over the case and that, assuming that the Labor Arbiter had such
jurisdiction, he gravely abused his discretion in finding that Jardin had been
illegally dismissed even in the absence of evidentiary support thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the Resolution of May
29, 1981, the NLRC</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"></span></span></a><span style=""><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dismissed the </span>appeal <span style="">on the sole ground that since Jardin had not
been furnished with a copy of the appeal within the reglementary period of ten
days, no appeal had been duly perfected by the PSPC.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">PSPC filed a motion for reconsideration of said Resolution
alleging that it had furnished Jardin with a copy of its memo­randum of appeal
which was attached to its opposition to Jardin's motion for issuance of a writ
of execution.  The PSPC also stressed
that the Bureau of Employment Services and not the arbitration section of the
Ministry of Labor, had jurisdiction over the case.  In the Resolution of February 9, 1984, the NLRC <u>en banc</u><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></sup></span></span></a><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
denied the motion for reconsideration and lifted the injunction it had issued
in the case.  Mentioning the fact that
PSPC had repeatedly raised the issue of jurisdiction in all its previous cases
without success, the NLRC held that the case fell "within the ambit of
compulsory arbitration." The NLRC also ruled that PSPC's "belated
service" of the appeal memorandum "did not cure the infirmity of the
appeal" and therefore the PSPC failed to comply within the reglementary
period with the mandatory requirements of an appeal (Rollo, pp. 59-60).</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the instant petition for <i>certiorari</i> filed by PSPC
asserting that the Labor Arbiter had no jurisdiction over the case and
therefore the decision he had rendered is null and void, that the NLRC abused
its discretion in dismissing the appeal on the technical ground of failure to
furnish the adverse party with a copy of the appeal memorandum, and that, granting
that the Labor Arbiter had jurisdiction over the case, he erred in finding that
Jardin had been illegally dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is impressed with merit.<span style="" lucida="" console="" ;=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">When Jardin filed the complaint for illegal dismissal on January
31, 1979, Art. 217 (5) of the Labor Code provided that Labor Arbiters and the
NLRC shall have "exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide" all cases
arising from employer-employee relations "unless expressly excluded by
this Code." At that time, Art. 15 of the same Code had been amended by
P.D. No. 1412 which took effect on June 9, 1978.  The pertinent provision of the said presidential decree states:</p>

<blockquote>"Article 15.  <u>Bureau
of Employment Services.</u>  -<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>(a)  x x x  x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b) The Bureau shall
have the original and exclusive jurisdiction over all matters or cases
involving employer-employee relations including money claims, arising out of or
by virtue of any law or contracts involving Filipino workers for overseas
employment, except seamen.  The
decisions of the Bureau shall be final and executory subject to appeal to the
Secretary of Labor whose decisions shall be final and inappealable."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Considering that private respondent Jardin's claims undeniably
arose out of an employer-employee relationship with petitioner PSPC and that
private respondent worked overseas or in Saudi Arabia, the Bureau of Employment
Services and not the Labor Arbiter had jurisdiction over the case.
"Overseas employment" is defined by Art. 13(h) of the Labor Code as
"employment of a worker outside the Philippines." Since the definition
does not make a distinction regarding the nationality of the employer, Filipino
employers who deploy their employees abroad should be deemed covered by the
definition (<u>See</u>:  Philippine
National Construction Corporation v. NLRC, 193 SCRA 401 [1991]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Art. 15 was further amended by P.D. No. 1691 which took effect on
May 1, 1980.  Such amendment qualified
the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Employment Services as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"(b) The
regional offices of the Ministry of Labor shall have the original and exclusive
jurisdiction over all matters or cases involving employer-employee relations
including money claims, arising out of or by virtue of any law or contracts
involving Filipino workers for overseas employment except seamen:  <u>Provided</u>, That the Bureau of
Employment Services may, in the case of the National Capital Region, exercise
such power, whenever the Minister of Labor deems it appropriate.  The decisions of the regional offices or the
Bureau of Employment Services if so authorized by the Minister of Labor as
provided in this Article, shall be appealable to the National Labor Relations
Commission upon the same grounds provided in Article 223 hereof.  The decisions of the National Labor
Relations Commission shall be final and inappealable."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, as further amended, Art. 15 provided for concurrent
jurisdiction between the regional offices of the then Ministry of Labor and the
Bureau of Employment Services" in the case of the National Capital
Region." It is noteworthy that P.D. No. 1691, while likewise amending Art.
217 of the Labor Code, did not alter the provision that Labor Arbiters shall
have jurisdiction over all claims arising from employer-employee relations
"unless expressly excluded by this Code."</p>

<p class="BODY">The functions of the Bureau of Employment Services were
subsequently assumed by the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration
(POEA) on May 1, 1982 by virtue of Executive Order No. 797 by granting the POEA
"original and exclusive jurisdiction over all cases, including money
claims, involving employer?employee relations arising out of or <span style="">by </span>virtue of any law or contract
involving Filipino workers for overseas employment, including seamen"
(Sec. 4(a); Eastern Shipping Lines v. Philippine Overseas Employment
Administration [POEA], 200 SCRA 663 [1991]).  This development showed the legislative authority's continuing intent to
<u>exclude</u> from the Labor Arbiter's j<span style="">urisdiction
claims arising from overseas employment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">These amendments notwithstanding, when the complaint for illegal
dismissal was filed on January 31, 1979, under Art. 15, as amended by P.D. No.
1412, it was the Bureau of Employment Services which had jurisdiction over the
case and not the Labor Arbiters.  It is
a settled rule that jurisdiction is determined by the statute in force at the
time of the commencement of the action (Municipality of Sogod v. Rosal, 201
SCRA 632, 637 <span style="">[1991]).  P.D. No. 1691 which gave the regional
offices of the Ministry of Labor concurrent jurisdiction with the Bureau of
Employment Services, was promulgated more than a year after the complaint was
filed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is indubitable that at the time the Labor Arbiter took
cognizance of the complaint for illegal dismissal, he was devoid of
jurisdiction.  Consequently, the
decision promulgated by him is null and void having been rendered without
jurisdiction and may be struck down any time - even on appeal to the Supreme
Court (Suarez v. Court of Appeals, 186 SCRA 339 [1990]).</p>

<p class="BODY">On the issue of whether or not the NLRC abused its discre­tion in
dismissing the appeal on the technical ground of failure to furnish the adverse
party with a copy of the appeal memorandum, the ruling of the Court in <u>Remerco
Garments Manufac­turing v. Minister of Labor and Employment</u> 135 SCRA 167,
178 [1985] 178) is squarely in point.  The Court said therein:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x </span>x x<span style="">.  </span>The
mere failure to furnish copy of the appeal memorandum to adverse party is not a
fatal defect.  We have consistently
adhered to the principle clearly held in <u><span style="">Alonso vs. Villamor</span></u><span style=""> </span>that
‘technicality when it deserts its proper office as an aid to justice and become
its great hindrance and chief enemy, deserves scant consideration from court.’
In a more forceful language, Jr. Chief Justice Enrique M. Fernando, speaking
for the Court, in <u>Meracap vs. International Ceramics Manufacturing Co., Inc</u>.
stated that ‘from the strictly juridical standpoint, it cannot be too strongly
stressed, to follow Davis in his masterly work, Discretionary Justice, that
where a decision may be made to rest on informed judgment rather than rigid
rules, all the equities of the case must be accorded their due weight.  Finally, labor law determinations, to quote
from Bultmann, should be not only <u>secundum retionem</u> but also <u>secundum
caritatem</u>’.  More recently, we held
that in appeals in labor cases, non-service of the <span style="">copy of </span>the appeal or appeal memorandum to the adverse party is
not a jurisdictional defect, and does not justify dismissal of the appeal.  Likewise, it was held that dismissal of an
employee's appeal on a purely technical ground is inconsistent with the
constitutional mandate on protection to labor."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The NLRC therefore arbitrarily and despotically exercised its
power by evading its positive duty to entertain the appeal on a purely
technical ground.  As the Court said in <u>Rapid
Manpower Consultants, Inc. v. NLRC</u> 190 SCRA 747, 752 [1990]).
"(t)echnicality should not be allowed to stand in the way of equitably and
completely resolving the rights and obligations of the parties." In view
of the clear lack of jurisdiction on the part of the Labor Arbiter over the
complaint for illegal dismissal filed by private respondent, and the apparent
abuse of discretion on the part of <span style="">the
NLRC in </span>refusing to resolve petitioner's appeal, there is no reason to
discuss the merits of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant petition for <i>certiorari</i> is
GRANTED and the proceedings below NULLIFIED but without prejudice to the right
of private respondent Perfecto Jardin to refile with the Philippine Overseas
Employment Administration his claim against the petitioner Philippine-Singapore
Ports Authority.</p>
