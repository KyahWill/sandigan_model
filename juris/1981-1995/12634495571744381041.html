this Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"In <span class="SpellE">Vitug</span> vs. Republic, (L-44890,
Feb. 28, 1977), <span style="">we </span>once again
reaffirmed our ruling in Ramos vs. Republic, 69 SCRA 576 (Feb. 27, 1976), that
'(the) basic rule of finality of judgments is applicable indiscriminately to
one and all and regardless of whether respondent employer be a public or
private employer, since the rule is grounded on fundamental considerations of
public policy and sound practice that at risk of occasional error, the judgment
of courts and award of <span class="SpellE">quasi<span style="">judicial</span></span><span style=""> agencies
must become final at some definite dated fixed by law."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Workmen's Compensation Commission, therefore, clearly erred
in modifying the award by increasing the amount to P4,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Moreover, the computation
of the award of P2,101.84 by the Acting Referee is correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He com­puted the amount thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The claimant having been shown to have been disabled for
labor as a result of his illness and was by reason thereof compelled to retire
prematurely at the age of 63 years, 2 years away from the compulsory retirement
age of 65 years, he is entitled to disability compensation for two (2) years
and reimbursement of expense for medical supplies and services since the
requirements of notice of the illness and corresponding treatment has been
substantially complied with.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Under Sections 14 and 15 of Act 3428 as amended, having been
totally and perma­nently disabled for labor, and in the light of the rule laid
down by the Supreme <span style="">Court in the case
of Hernandez vs. W.C.C. et al., G.R. NO. L-20202, May 31, 1965, claimant is
entitled to disability compen­sation in an amount equivalent to 60% of his
average weekly wage for a maximum period of two (2) years, or 104 weeks, the
aggregate amount not to exceed P4,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>By the evidence his last rate of pay was P146.00 a month or P1,752.00
per annum (P1,752.00 divided by 52 equals P33.69) </span>60% of which is P20.21
for 104 weeks, gives P2,101.84 as disability compensation."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

this Court said that compensation payments premised on loss or impairment of
earning, capacity due to illness cannot extend beyond the compulsory retire­ment
date of an employee.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The award of P2,101.84 to
the private respond­ent will not be deducted from the gratuity which he was
entitled to receive when he reached the age of 65 years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anent this matter, the petitioner states in
its brief:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Respondent Commission's differentia­tion between the
Workmen's Compensation Law and the Retirement Law is beside the point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner admits that the purposes of the
said laws are different.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petition­er
does not deny also that respondent <span class="SpellE">Pollosco</span> is
entitled both to the benefits of the Workmen's Compensation Law and the
Retirement Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first instance,
because he contracted illness in the course of his employment with petitioner
and in the second, because he applied for retire­ment under the Retirement
Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, petitioner does
not contend that any benefit which respondent <span class="SpellE">Pollosco</span>
will receive under the Workmen's Compen­sation Act, as amended, should be
deducted from the benefit which he would receive as gratuity and therefore
diminishes his com­pensation under the Workmen's Compensation Law."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Workmen's Compensation Commission also erred in the
computation of the disability benefit to be awarded to the private respondent.</p>
