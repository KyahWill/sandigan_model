				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The admissibility of the evidence seized from the accused at a
checkpoint after being stopped for routine inspection is put to test in this
appeal from the decision<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> of
the Regional Trial Court of Cavite City finding <i style="">inter alia</i><span style=""> </span>accused-appellant
Restituto B. Bocalan guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Sec. 4, Art.
II, of R.A. 6425, as amended, otherwise known as "The Dangerous Drugs Act
of 1972."</p>

<p class="BODY">On 2 November 1982, at about 8:15 in the evening, a private jeep
driven by accused-appellant Restituto B. Bocalan <span style="">was </span>stopped at a police checkpoint in Cavite City for routine
inspection regarding unlicensed firearms and other <span style="">prohibited items.  With Bocalan
were his co-accused Jaime P. Fernandez and Rodelio C.</span> <span style="">Exala.  Pfc. Ricardo Galang, a member of the inspection team, went near the jeep
and asked the occupants </span><span style="">if </span><span style="">there were firearms inside.  They answered in the negative.  Pfc. Galang then proceeded to </span>inspect
the vehicle by beaming a flashlight inside.  He noticed a black leather bag measuring about one (1) foot wide and two
(2) feet long with its sides bulging.  He asked <span style="">what </span><span style="">it </span><span style="">contained.  There was deadenin</span>g,<span style=""> silence.  </span>Nobody answered.  Instead,
the three (3) accused, Restituto B. Bocalan, Jaime P. Fernandez and Rodelio C.
Exala, suddenly became fidgety.  Suspicious, Pfc. Galang ordered the bag opened.  He found what he excitedly described <span style="">as "</span>marijuana, marijuana,
napakaraming <span style="">marijuana!" </span>At
this juncture, the three (3) remained motionless in their seats and appeared
petrified with fear.  They were brought
to the police station that <span style="">same night </span>for
further investigation.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After laboratory
examination, the bag </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">verified to <span style="">contain </span></span>more <span style="">than </span>two
(2) kilos <span style="">of </span>Indian hemp
otherwise <span style="">known
</span>as marijuana.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, Rodelio C. Exala, Restituto Bocalan and Jaime P.
Fernandez were accordingly charged for violation of Sec. 4, Art. II, of R.A.
6425, as amended.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, Bocalan <span style="">was </span>held guilty as principal and sentenced
to <span style="">life </span>imprisonment.  A fine of P25,000.00 was also imposed.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The other two (2) were convicted as accomplices and received lighter
penalties.  Fernandez appealed to the
Court of Appeals.  Exala did not.</p>

<p class="BODY">Bocalan, whose punishment is reviewable only by this Court, is <span style="">now </span>before
Us assailing his conviction; hence, We deal only with him in this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Bocalan seeks exculpation by imputing ownership of the
bag to Exala alone.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Bocalan claims that while on the way to Cavite City, he and Fernandez offered
Exala a ride.  Exala accepted the offer
and requested <span style="">Bocalan to make a detour
to Salitran, Dasmariñas, Cavite, where he </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">to pick up some clothes.  They
agreed and Exala got the bag which he kept beside him all the time until their
apprehension at the checkpoint.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Bocalan further contends that the trial court erred in admitting
the bag as evidence against him since it was obtained through a warrantless
search.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The protestations of Bocalan are devoid of merit.  We agree with the trial court that the
conduct of Bocalan was not only unusual but also contrary to normal human
experience.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>He alleged that he knew Exala only by
face and had no personal association with him;<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a> yet, on
that eventful day of 2 November 1982, he agreed to detour to Salitran which was
some fifteen (15) to twenty (20) kilometers out of his way.  Thus, his contention that <span style="">it </span><span style="">was </span>Exala
who owned the bag containing the marijuana <span style="">is </span>hardly credible.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, Exala decla<span style="">r</span>ed that it <span style="">was </span>he who did not know the contents of the bag as it was
already in the jeep when he boarded it.  Exala asserted that it was either Bocalan or Fernandez who owned the
bag.  Exala swore that Bocalan and
Fernandez offered him P<span style="">5,000.00, </span>later
raised to <span style="">P10,000.00, </span>to take
the blame alone, but he refused.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Proof <span style="">of </span>ownership
is immaterial where the accused is charged with the unlawful transportation of
marijuana.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Section 4, Art. II, of R.A. 6425, as amended, dos not require that one be the <span style="">owner </span>of the prohibited drug before <span style="">he can be prosecuted for </span><span style="">d</span><span style="">ispatching
in transit or </span>transporting a prohibited drug.  The law simply provides thus -</p>

<blockquote>"<i>Sec. 4.  Sale,
Administration, Delivery, Distribution and Transportation of Prohibited Drugs</i>.
- The penalty of life imprisonment to death <span style="">and a fine ranging from twenty thousand to thirty thousand </span><span style="">pesos </span><span style="">shall be imposed upon any person who, unless
authorized by law, shall sell, administer, deliver, give away to another,
distribute, dispatch in transit or transport any prohibited drug, or shall act
as a broker in any of such transactions.  If the victim of the offense is a minor, or</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">should
a prohibited drug involved in any offense under this Section be the proximate
cause of the death of a victim thereof, the maximum penalty herein </span><span style="">provided shall be </span><span style="">imposed."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Nonetheless, there is substantial evidence to prove that Bocalan
was directly involved i<span style="">n </span>the
unlawful dispatch in transit <span style="">or </span>transport
of marijuana.  The evidence of the <span style="">prosecution, particularly the testimonies of
Pfc. Ricardo Galang and Pat. Rosauro </span>de Guzman; belies the defense of
Bocalan and establishes beyond cavil that he was caught <i style=""><span style="">in</span></i><span style=""> </span><i style=""><span style="">flagrante</span></i><span style=""> </span><i style=""><span style="">delicto</span></i><span style=""> </span><span style="">of transporting the prohibited drug; that </span>he
was the driver of the jeep owned by his father <span style="">that </span>carried the stuff; and, that he was in fact <span style="">the owner of the </span>bag.  The trial court noted that Bocalan picked up
Fernandez and Exala one after the other to accompany <span style="">him </span>to the place where the bag of
marijuana was taken and to help him bring the marijuana to Cavite City.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Regardless of the degree of <span style="">participation
of Fernandez and Exala, Bocalan <span style="">is </span>correctly
punished for his direct involvement in the crime.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Such factual conclusions by the trial court relative <span style="">to </span>the credibility of witnesses are entitled
to great respect and are generally sustained by the ap<span style="">p</span>ellate court unless some material facts have been overlooked or
misconstrued as to affect the result.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
There is none in this case on appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">We turn to the legal question on the admissibility of the
marijuana as evidence in the light of Bocalan's contention that it was seized
without a valid search warrant.  Since
the search was conducted prior to the arrest, Bocalan argues that it was not
incident to a lawful arrest.</p>

<p class="BODY">This issue was never raised in the proceedings below.  Bocalan never objected to the admissibility
of the evidence on the ground that the same was obtained in a warrantless
search.  Consequently, he is deemed to
have waived his objection on the legality of the search and the admissibility
of the evidence obtained in the course thereof.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a> In
view of such waiver, the court is bound to admit the evidence.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
But even assuming <i style="">a</i><i style=""><span style="">rguendo</span></i><span style=""> </span>that there
was no waiver, still appela<span style="">n</span>t<span style="">'</span>s contention deserves  scant consideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">There are indeed instances where search and seizure can be
effected without necessarily being preceded by an arrest.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
An illustration would be the "<span style="">s</span>top-and-s<span style="">e</span>arch" <span style="">without a warrant at military or police checkpoints, the
constitutionality of which has already been upheld by this </span>Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Vehicles are generally allowed to pass through these checkpoints after a
routine i<span style="">n</span>spection and answering
a few questions.  If vehicles are
stopped and extensively searched it is because of some probable cause which <span style="">justifies a </span>reasonable
belief of those manning the <span style="">checkpoints
that either the motorist is a law</span><span style="">-</span><span style="">offender or the contents of the vehicle are
or have been instruments in the commission of an offense.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> However, lest it be misunderstood, this
doctrine is not intended to do away with the general rule that no person shall
be subjected to search of his person, personal effects and belongings, or his
residence except by virtue of a search warrant or on the occasion of a lawful
arrest.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The case before Us is an </span>incident to
or an offshoot of a lawful "stop-and-search<span style="">"</span> at a military or police checkpoint.</p>

<p class="BODY">The checkpoint in the instant base was established in line with
"Operation Bakal" the main object of which was to search<span style=""> </span>for unlicensed firearms and other
prohibited items in the possession of unauthorized persons passing through it.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
When the jeep carrying the contraband passed through the checkpoint, it was
flagged down and the occupants were asked <span style="">routine
questions.  In the course thereof, Pfc.
Galang noticed a black leather bag the sides </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">which were
bulging.  He asked what the contents of
the bag were.  None of the accused
answered.  At that </span>moment, <span style="">the demeanor of the accused changed; they
became suspiciously quiet and nervous as if they were concealing something from
Pfc. Galang.  The accused clearly
appeared to be in abject fear of being discovered.  Such peculiar apprehensiveness if not restrained reaction of the </span><span style="">accused, </span><span style="">which did not appear normal, provided the probable cause </span><span style="">justifying </span><span style="">a more extensive search that led to the
opening of the bag and the discovery of the prohibited stuff.  Significantly, there was no </span><span style="">sign </span><span style="">of any protest or objection to the search.  The accused remained silent even after heir arrest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Their submissive stance after the discovery of the bag of
marijuana, as well as the absence of any <span style="">p</span>rotest
on their part when arrested, not only casts serious doubt on their professed
innocence<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
but also confirms their acquiescence to the search.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
Clearly then, there was waiver of the right against <span style="">unreasonable search and seizure.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> In one </span>case.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
We held -<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x x x x When one voluntarily, submits to a search or consents
to have it made of his person or premises, he i<span style="">s </span>precluded from later complaining
thereof (Cooley, Constitutional Limitations, 8th Ed., Vol. 1, p 361).  The right to be secure from unreasonable
search and seizure may, like every right, <u><span style="">be waived and such</span> </u><u><span style="">waiver
</span></u><u><span style="">may be made either
expressly </span></u><u><span style="">or impliedly</span></u><span style="">" </span>(underscoring supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The arrest of the three (3) accused was lawful because it was
made upon the discovery of the prohibited drug in their possession.  There was no need for a warrant; the arrest <span style="">was </span>made
while a crime was committed.  This is
one of the situations envisioned by Sec. 5, par. (a), of Rule 113 of the 1985
Rules on Criminal Procedure, as amended, when a warrantless arrest may be made.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
The accused were caught the act of dispatching in transit or transporting
marijuana, in violation of Sec. 4, Art. II, of R.A. 6425, as amended.</p>

<p class="BODY">The alleged contradiction between the sworn statements of Pfc.
Galang and Pat. de Guzman was explained in their separate testimonies and, in
any event, has been resolved by the<span style=""> </span>trial court as a factual issue.  <span style="">We </span>find, no reason to reverse its finding.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent, the argument that the three (3) accused should not have
been assigned different level levels of liability, suffice it to say that
whether a principal, co-principal, or conspirator, accused-appellant would have
been meted out the same penalty imposed by the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, there being no reversible error in the <span style="">decision appealed from finding
accused-appellant </span><span style="">RESTITUTO B. BOCALAN </span>guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime
<span style="">charged, </span><span style="">the same is </span><span style="">AFFIRMED, </span><span style="">with </span><span style="">costs </span><span style="">against him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<div align="JUSTIFY"><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="NOSHADE" align="CENTER"><i></i><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;">DISSENTING OPINION</span><br></div><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">CRUZ, J.:</span><br><br>I dissent, for the reasons expressed in my dissenting opinions in Valmonte v. de Villa, 185 SCRA 665/178 SCRA 211, and People v. Malmstedt, 198 SCRA 401, and the following additional observations.<br><br>I am opposed to checkpoints as regular police measures aimed at reducing criminality in general.&nbsp; I do not agree that in the interest of peace and order, any or every vehicle may be stopped at any time by the authorities and searched without warrant on the chance that it may be carrying prohibited articles.&nbsp; That possibility is not the probable cause envisioned in the Bill of Rights.<br><br>In the case of the ordinary checkpoint, there is not even any suspicion to justify the search.&nbsp; The search is made as a matter of course, either of all vehicles or at random.&nbsp; There is no showing that a crime is about to be committed, is actually being committed, or has just been committed and the searching officer has personal knowledge that the person being searched or arrested is the culprit.<br><br>I will concede that checkpoints may be established at borders of states or at "constructive borders" near the boundary for the purpose of preventing violations of immigration and customs laws.&nbsp; But in the interior of the territory, the requirements of a valid search and seizure must be strictly observed.&nbsp; The only permissible exemption is where a crime like a bank robbery has just been committed or a jailbreak has just occurred, and the authorities have to seal off all possible avenues of escape in the area.&nbsp; In all other cases, I submit that the checkpoint should not be allowed.<br><br>I realize that this view would result in the inadmissibility of the seized marijuana as evidence against the petitioner and in his inevitable acquittal.&nbsp; But as I have always maintained, we cannot retroactively validate an illegal search on the justification that, after all, the articles seized are illegal.&nbsp; That is putting the cart before the horse.&nbsp; I would rather see some criminals go unpunished now and then than agree to the Bill of Rights being systematically ignored in the oppressive checkpoint.&nbsp; Respect for the Constitution is more important than securing a conviction based on a violation of the rights of the accused.<br></div></div>
