				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Once again, in the resolution of an appeal, the Court is called upon
to apply a familiar rule of unvarying observance which is, that only questions
of law may be raised in a petition for review on <i>certiorari </i>of a
judgment of the Court of Appeals, this Court being bound by the latter's
findings of fact,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

resolves the proceedings at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">The proceedings originated from a complaint of Amelia C. <span class="SpellE">Elayda</span> filed in the Court of First Instance (now Regional
Trial Court) at <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>
against the Spouses Pedro <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> and Leonora T. <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span>In her complaint, <span class="SpellE">Elayda</span>
basically sought recovery of loans extended to the defendants in the aggregate
sum of <i>P90,000.00, </i>with <span class="GramE">interest</span>, the loans
having been secured by post-dated checks issued by the spouses and receipts
signed by them purporting to show that they had received jewelry to be sold on
commission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In their answer, the <span class="SpellE">Roxases</span> admitted having received said loans but claimed
that the loans had been paid in full; that in fact, their total payments exceeded
the total obligation justly and actually due from them, and they had been
required to pay usurious interests.</p>

<p class="BODY">On these issues, trial was had.</p>

<p class="BODY">The plaintiff, <span class="SpellE">Elayda</span>, presented her
testimonial and documentary proofs in due course, in substantiation of her
cause of action for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">recovery </span>of <i>P90<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> </i>plus interest.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> spouses in their turn,
adduced evidence which tended to show that they had received the loans
aggregating <i>P90,000.00 </i>on two separate occasions -- one in the sum of
P40,000.00 and the other, in the amount of P50,000.00; that they were required
to give, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">and </span>did give, a
"kickback" of P10,000.00 and to pay, as they did pay, interest at the
rate of four percent (4%) a month; and that the total payments made by them to <span class="SpellE">Elayda</span> amounted to P112,674.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">To counteract this evidence of the <span class="SpellE">Roxases</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Elayda</span> tried to submit a statement prepared by her
accountant to the effect that the total loan given by her to the spouses
amounted to <i>P186,000.00, </i>not <i>P90,000.00 </i>(as stated in her
complaint and as sought to be established by her in her evidence-in-chief);
that the payments made by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">spouses on
account </span>thereof came up to only P110,474.00 -- of which the sum of
P14,223.81 was charged to interest <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">at </span>14%
per annum and P96,250.19, to principal -- thus leaving a balance due from them
of P89,749.81.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The proffered statement
was rejected by the Trial Court, on objection of the <span class="SpellE">Roxases</span>,
on the ground that it was contrary to the judicial admissions in plaintiff's
complaint and was being presented after conclusion of the trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Trial Court thereafter rendered judgment adversely to the
plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Elayda</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Upon the ultimate finding <span class="GramE">that :</span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">" *</span> * (as
established by the evidence) defendants have paid plaintiff the total sum of
P112,674.00 on account of the principal loan of P90,000.00 but it is settled
law that in a usurious transaction the creditor may only be reimbursed the
amount of the principal loan and must return the interest paid by the debtor
the agreement to that effect being null and void (Art. <span class="GramE">1957,
New Civil Code).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It results that
plaintiff is under obligation to return to defendants the sum of P22<span class="GramE">,674.00</span> representing the kickback and usurious interest
charged on the loan.",</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in"><span class="GramE">it</span> disposed of
the case as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the preponderance of evidence being clearly in
favor of defendants, the complaint is dismissed and the plaintiff is condemned
to reimburse and return to defendants the sum of P22<span class="GramE">,674.00</span>.
with costs against plaintiff."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Elayda</span> filed a motion for
reconsideration and/or new trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This

 17, 1964</st1:date> as well as attorney's fees and costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The assignment of errors makes it obvious that the whole case
turns on one crucial issue, which is, whose version of the material occurrences
has been established by a preponderance of the evidence:</p>

<p class="BODY">a)<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>that of <span class="SpellE">Elayda</span> -- that the amount lent by her to <span class="GramE">the<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Roxas</span></span>
Spouses was actually <i>P186,000.00, </i>not <i>P90,000.00 </i>(as set out in
her complaint); that the payments made by the defendants added up to only
P110,474.00, of which the sum of P14,223.81 was applied to interest at 14% per
annum and P96,250.19, to principal, thus leaving a balance of P89,749.81 still
owing to her -- or</p>

<p class="BODY">b)<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>that of the <span class="SpellE">Roxases</span> -- that the loan in truth given was only <i>P90,000.00
; </i>that they gave on demand a "kickback" of P10,000.00 and paid
interest at the rate of four percent (4%) a month; and that all the payments
made by them, really came to P112,674.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be equally obvious that the determination of this issue
-- which includes substantially all other questions set up by <span class="SpellE">Elayda</span> (e.g., whether or not the checks given to Lim Go
Tong constituted additional loans of the <span class="SpellE">Roxases</span>;
whether interest at usurious rates was in fact paid; etc.) -- is essentially a
factual adjudication which, by authority of the rule and precedents adverted to
in the opening paragraph of this opinion, is conclusive on and may not be
reviewed by this Court, absent any of the recognized exceptions thereto.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But this is what at bottom petitioner would
have this Court do:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>go over the proofs
presented by the parties, and analyze, assess and weigh them to ascertain if
the Trial Court and the Appellate Court were correct in according superior
credit to this or that piece of evidence and eventually, to the totality of the
evidence of one party or the other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This, the Court cannot and will not do.</p>

<p class="BODY">Of course, the matter of whether a particular item of proof was
properly admitted or rejected in light of the rules of <span class="GramE">evidence,</span>
is an issue of law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Of this character is
the issue raised by <span class="SpellE">Elayda</span> in respect of the Trial
Court's rejection of her accountant's statement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">This issue</span> this
Court can and does now pass upon.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court declares the rejection to be correct.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such rejection is entirely in accord with the
"familiar doctrine" that "an admission made in the pleadings
cannot be <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> by the party making such
admission and are conclusive as to him, and that all proofs submitted by him
contrary thereto or inconsistent therewith, should be ignored, whether
objection is interposed by the party or not * * <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt">"</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"> </span>That doctrine, by the way, has since
been embodied in the revised Rules of Court, effective on January 1, 1964,
Section 2, Rule 129 of which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"<i>Judicial admissions.</i></span><i> -- </i>Admis<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">s</span>ions<i> </i>made by the parties in the
pleadings, or in the course of the trial or other proceedings do not require
proof and can not be contradicted unless previously shown to have been made
through palpable mistake."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Nothing in the record shows that <span class="SpellE">Elayda's</span>
admissions in her complaint were indeed "made through palpable
mistake."</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, if it be true that the total loan liability of the <span class="SpellE">Roxases</span> was not <i>P90,000.00 </i>only, but P186,000.00 (or
P187,600.00), it is quite surprising that <span class="SpellE">Elayda's</span>
evidence-in-chief, as plaintiff, was directed to proving an obligation of only
P90,000.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even more surprising is the
fact that in her complaint <span class="SpellE">Elayda</span> only alleged the
sum of <i>P90<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> </i>as the indebtedness of the <span class="SpellE">Roxases</span> to her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
evidence of an indebtedness in excess of P90<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
would therefore appear to be a mere afterthought, difficult to accept at face
value.</p>

<p class="BODY">Also correct was the Trial Court's ruling, sustained by the
Appellate Court, that <span class="SpellE">Elayda's</span> failure to deny
specifically and under oath the accusation of usury set out in the <span class="SpellE">Roxases</span>' Amended Answer with Counterclaim -- alleging that <span class="SpellE">Elayda</span> required and received from the <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>
Spouses, "kickback and interest in excess of the legal rate" --
constituted an admission of that accusation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The ruling is entirely in accord with Section 1, Rule 9 of the Rules of
Court which pertinently provides that "(a<span class="GramE">)<span class="SpellE">llegations</span></span> of usury are deemed admitted if not
denied specifically and under oath." The admission is a judicial
admission, albeit implied, and cannot be negated "unless previously shown
to have been made through palpable mistake," <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">supra, </span></i>a showing which <span class="SpellE">Elayda</span> has
not made.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for review on <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">certiorari </span></i>is DENIED and the
challenged judgment of the Court of Appeals, upholding that of the Trial Court,
is AFFIRMED, with costs against the petitioner.</p>
