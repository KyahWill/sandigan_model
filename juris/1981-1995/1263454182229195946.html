				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner Florencio Monreal filed an action in the Court of
Agrarian Relations in Legazpi City against private respondents Teresa M. Loria,
Leodegario Loria and Flaviano Manzanilla for reinstatement and/or legal
redemption or pre-emption with damages.  Petitioner alleged that since 1955 he was the tenant of Albina Monreal
over a parcel of land situated at Busay, Daraga, Albay, containing an area of
1/<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">4 </span>hectare more or less; that
on December 19, 1967, private respondents Teresa and Leodegario Loria, claiming
to have bought the property from Albina Monreal, entered the said landholding
after he (petitioner) had plowed, irrigated and hoed the same in preparation
for the planting; that he was driven out of the landholding and, in his stead,
Flaviano Manzanilla was illegally placed.  Further, petitioner averred that as an adjacent boundary owner, private
respond­ents failed to notify him in writing of his right of legal pre-emption
or redemption pursuant to Article 1623 of the New Civil Code, or of his right
as a tenant to pre-emption in accordance with the Land Reform Code; and that he
(petitioner) consigned the purchase price of P1,400.00 with the Clerk of Court
of the Court of Agrarian Relations when private respondents Teresa and
Leodegario Loria refused to accept the same.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Trial on the merits
followed and decision was rendered wherein petitioner's claim was sustained
over private respondents' assertion that he was only a hired farmhand.  The Court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> rejected
petitioner's claim of preferential right against the private respondents under
Article 1621 of the Civil Code, as both parties are adjacent owners of the
questioned landholding.  However,
petitioner's right of redemption under Section 12 of the Land Reform Code which
states:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 12.  <u>Lessee's</u>
<u>Right of</u> <u>Redemption</u>.  - In
case the landholding is sold to a third person without the knowledge of the
agricultural lessee, the latter shall have the right to redeem the same at a
reasonable price and consideration:  <u>Provided</u>
<u>further</u>, That where there are two or more agricultural lessees, each
shall be entitled to said right of redemption only to the extent of the area
actually cultivated by him.  The right
of redemption under this Section may be exercised within two years from the
registration of the sale, and shall have priority over any other right of legal
redemption."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">was
upheld and the private respondents, Teresa and Leodegario Loria, were ordered
to execute a deed of reconveyance in favor of petitioner Florencio Monreal in
consideration of which said private respondents were authorized to withdraw the
sum of P1,400.00 deposited by petitioner in court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The decision, dated March 11, 1969, of the Court of Agrarian
Relations was received by private respondents on March 19, 1969.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 28, 1969, private respondents Teresa and Leodegario
Loria filed with the Court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> a Notice of Appeal and Motion
for Approval of Appeal Bond of P120.00 which was filed on even date.  However, no copy of said Notice of Appeal
was filed with the Court of Appeals in accordance with Sections 2, 3, and 4 of
Republic Act No. 5434 which read:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 2.  <u>Appeals to
Court of Appeals</u>.  - Appeals to the
Court of Appeals shall be filed within fifteen (15) days from notice of the
ruling, award, order, decision or judgment or from the date of its last publica­tion,
if publication is required by law for its effectivity; or in case a motion for
reconsideration is filed within that period of fifteen (15) days, then within
ten (10) days from notice or publication, when required by law, of the resolu­tion
denying the motion for recon­sideration.  No more than one motion for reconsideration shall be allowed any
party.  If no appeal is filed within the
periods here fixed, the ruling, award, order, decision or judgment shall become
final and may be executed as provided by existing law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SEC. 3.  <u>How
appeals taken</u>.  Appeals shall be
taken by filing a notice of appeal with the Court of Appeals and with the
court, officer, board, commission or agency that made or rendered the ruling,
award, order, decision or judgment appealed from, serving a copy thereof on all
other interested parties.  The notice of
appeal shall state, under oath, the material dates to show that it was filed
within the period fixed in this Act.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SEC. 4.  <u>Docketing
fee and deposits for costs</u>.  -Upon
filing of the notice of appeal, the appellant shall pay to the Clerk of the
Court of Appeals the docketing fee fixed in Rule 141, Section 2(a) of the Rules
of Court and deposit the sum of fifty pesos (P50.00) for costs, or in case the
appellant be a laborer, employee, agricultural lessee, or tenant, a motion
setting forth said fact under oath, and praying that he be exempted from
payment of docketing fee and the deposit for costs.  Copy of the motion shall be served on all interested
parties.  Should the court find said
motion to be well founded it shall grant the same; but if the Court denies the
motion, the appel­lant shall pay the docketing fee and make the deposit for
costs within fifteen (15) days from notice of the denial.  Failure to pay the docketing fee and make
the deposit for costs within the period here fixed shall be a ground to dismiss
the appeal."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is the position of herein petitioner that upon failure of the
private respondents to comply with the foregoing provisions of Republic Act
5434 the decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations which was received by
private respondents on March 19, 1969, became final after fifteen (15) days, or
on April 4, 1969; that the Notice of Appeal and the motion for its admission
filed by the private respondents on May 22, 1969 with the Court of Appeals were
filed out of time and, therefore, the decision of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
became final; that the Court of Appeals, as a consequence, lost its appellate
jurisdiction over the case; and that the Court of Agrarian Relations, on May
31, 1969, had already issued a writ of execution and, on July 9, 1969, herein
private respondents executed a deed of resale in favor of herein petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals entertained the appeal of private
respondents, set aside the appealed judgment and dismissed the complaint,
saying that -</p>

<blockquote>"x x x there is nothing in his (peti­tioner) testimony from
which it may even be inferred that he prepared the seedbed, cared for the
growing plants, gathered, bundled and stacked the harvest, etc., which are
phases of farm labor a tenant is required to do or contribute under Section
38.  Considering this in the light of
the legal premises above set forth, to­gether with defendants' (private
respondents) claim that they merely paid plaintiff (peti­tioner) to prepare and
plant the land, which work could be finished in two days, and plaintiff's
(petitioner) admission in the hearing of his application for an interlocu­tory
order for reinstatement and on the merits that his immediate predecessor in working
the land was a mere hired hand (tsn, pp. 16 and 18, hearing of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">January </span>23, 1968; p. 6, hearing of
August 7, 1968), as well as his doubtful allegation that despite the fact that
the former owner's contribution was the land alone, he shared equally the crops
with her, which actuation is not in keeping with his vigilance in taking care
of his interest or asserting his right as shown by his action in filing the
present complaint four days after defendants (private respondents) took pos­session
of the land, we find his claim that he was instituted as tenant to be tenuous
and indeed hard to accept."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal by <i>certiorari</i>, petitioner claims that the
Court of Appeals erred:  (1) in assuming
appellate jurisdiction of CAR Case No. 744, Albay '67, when elevated before it
in CA-G.R. No. 43686-R, as the decision rendered by CAR was already final and
duly executed; (2) in not finding Florencio Monreal as tenant of the
landholding in question; and, (3) in not sustaining the order of the CAR,
ordering private respondent to vacate the landholding in question and to
receive the amount of P1,400.00 in consider­ation of the resale of the land to
the petitioner, and ordering private respondents to execute a deed of resale in
favor of the petitioner of the aforementioned landholding.</p>

<p class="BODY">This appeal is devoid of merit.  It cannot be said that respondent Court of Appeals acted capriciously,
arbitrarily and whimsically when it assumed appellate jurisdiction of CAR Case
No. 744, Albay '67 considering that "the rule is always in favor of
liberality in construction so that the real matter in dispute ray be submitted
to the judgment of the court.  Imperfections of form and technicalities of procedure should be
disregarded unless substantial rights would otherwise be prejudiced."
(Clorox Co. vs. Director of Patents, et al., 20 SCRA 965).  Private respondents' failure to appeal in
accordance with the provisions of Republic Act 5434 was due to an honest
mistake and/or excus­able negligence.  As there was no sign of manifest intention to delay, the Court of
Appeals followed the liberal practice of allowing the appeal instead of
ordering dismissal on mere technicalities.  The underlying principle in the administration of justice and
application of the rules is substantial justice and fair play.</p>

<p class="BODY">The error committed by private respondents in following the
provision of the Rules of Court which is, by serving upon the adverse party and
filing with the trial court with­in thirty (30) days from notice of judgment,
the notice of appeal, the appeal bond, and a record on appeal, instead of
complying with the procedure for appeal pursuant to Republic Act 5434, which
is, filing a notice of appeal with the Court of Appeals and with the trial
court, within fifteen (15) days counted from the notice of the decision and
serving a copy thereof on all interested parties, was purely a procedural
matter.  It did not prejudice the
substantial rights of the petitioner who sought the annul­ment of the decision
of the appellate court because of this error.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the findings by the appellate court that herein
petitioner is not a tenant in subject property, suffice it to say that "it
has been invariably held that the findings of fact made by the Court of Appeals
in cases appealed to it are conclusive and not subject to review, alteration,
modification or reversal by the Supreme Court.  x x x Hence, for the purposes of this appeal, the said findings of fact
have to be accepted by this Court, and its only power will be to determine if
the legal conclusions drawn from said findings of fact are correct and if the
law has been correctly applied." (Hodges vs. People, 68 Phil. 178).</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, considering that petitioner was not a tenant of private
respondents, the issue whether he could avail <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">himself of the right of redemption granted in Section 12 of the Land
Reform Code is moot and academic and need not be discussed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the decision of the Court of Appeals, dated
October 26, 1970 is hereby AFFIRMED.  With costs against the petitioner.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
