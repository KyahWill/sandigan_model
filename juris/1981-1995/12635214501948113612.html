CARLITO MAGBANUA, BEN SANTAMINA and ERNESTO PINGGO were accused of 
murder in Criminal Case No. 1587 of the defunct Court of First Instance 
of Zamboanga City.  The infor­mation against the accused reads:
<p>
"That on or about December 11, 1976, in the City of Zamboanga, 
Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the 
above-named accused, conspiring and confederating together, mutually 
aiding and assisting one another, taking advantage of the night and of 
their superior strength to better accom­plish their purpose, grab from 
the possession of CIC BASIRI ASIMUDIN, a member of the 462nd PC Company 
stationed at PC Detachment in Recodo, this City, the latter's Service 
Pistol cal. 45 and once the above-named accused had in their possession 
the aforesaid pistol, with intent to kill, did then and there, wilfully,
 unlaw­fully and feloniously, assault, attack and shoot with the same 
pistol at the person of said Basiri Asimudin, thereby inflicting upon 
the latter's person mortal wounds which caused his death." (<em>Expediente</em>, p. 1.)
</p><p>
In a short and well-written decision, Judge Abdulwahid A. Bidin, now 
associate justice of the Intermediate Appellate Court, found the accused
 guilty as charged and sentenced "each and everyone of them to suffer 
the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>, to jointly and solidarily 
indem­nify the heirs of the deceased Basini Asimuddin in the amount of 
P12,000.00 and to pay the cost." (<em>Idem</em>, p. 95.)
</p><p>
All of the three appealed to this Court.  After the case had been 
submitted for decision, BEN SANTAMINA filed an Urgent Motion to Withdraw
 Appeal.  The motion was granted on February 15, 1984, for which reason 
only the appeal of MAGBANUA and PINGGO remains to be considered.
</p><p>
The facts, as found by the trial court, are as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Accused Carlito Magbanua, Ben Santamina and Ernesto Pinggo are 
fishermen and crew members of the Mizpah IV, a fishing boat which was on
 dry dock at Recodo, this City, for about five months prior to the 
incident which gave rise to the filing of the information in the 
above-entitled case.  In the evening of December 11, 1976 at about 7:00 
o'clock, the three accused went to the store of Leny Rodriguez at 
Recodo, this City, and bought a bottle of special brandy which they 
drank on a bench outside of the store.  The store was lighted with a 
petromax lamp.  Later that evening Albert Sala who resides nearby, 
arrived at the same store.  Albert Sala ordered for a bottle of coke 
which he drank inside the store.  Sometime later Basiri Asimuddin, a 
soldier assigned to the PC Detachment at Recodo, arrived at the store.  
Basiri Asimuddin asked also for a bottle of coke.  Basiri Asimuddin was 
in civilian clothes and had a .45 cal. pistol tucked to his left waist. 
 While Basiri Asimuddin was standing outside of the store drinking his 
bottle of coke, accused Carlito Magbanua suddenly embraced him from 
behind as accused Ernesto Pinggo held his (Asimuddin's) hands.  Then 
Ernesto Pinggo took the pistol from the left waist of Basiri Asimuddin 
and gave the pistol to accused Ben Santamina.  While Ernesto Pinggo and 
Carlito Magbanua were holding the hands of Basiri Asimuddin, Ben 
Santamina fired three shots at Basiri Asimuddin.  On the second shot 
Basiri Asimuddin fell and as he lay on the ground, Ben Santamina fired 
another shot.  Then the three, Ben Santamina, Carlito Magbanua and 
Ernesto Pinggo, fled towards the bushes with Ben Santamina taking the 
pistol along with him.  Later soldiers from the PC Detachment at Recodo 
arrived and brought Basiri Asimuddin to the Brent Hospital but Basiri 
Asimuddin expired before he was operated on, as certified by Dr. Jose 
Generoso and evidenced by the death certificate issued by him (Exhibit 
"B").  When examined early the following morning by Dr. Rodolfo 
Balmoria, a medico legal officer of the Philippine Constabulary at the 
Funeraria Villa, the deceased Basiri Asimuddin was found to have 
sustained three gun shot wounds, two of which were entrance wounds while
 the other was an exit wound, as follows: </p>
  <p>
  'Post mortem Findings:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      '1.  Gunshot wound, point of entry, lateral left lumbar region, 
directed laterally to the right, measuring 0.8 cm x 0.8, 3.5 cm from the
 anterior midline, contusion collar measuring 0. 3 cm posterior, 0.2 cm 
inferior and superior, 0.1 cm anterior with tatooing or smudging around 
the gunshot wound of entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      '2.  Gunshot wound, point of entry, lateral left iliac region, 
directed laterally to the right, measuring 0.9 cm x 0.8, 16 cm from the 
anterior midline, contusion collar measuring 0.3 cm posterior, 0.2 cm 
inferior and superior, 0.1 cm anterior with tatooing or smudging around 
the gunshot wound of entrance.
    </p>
    <p> '3.  Gunshot wound of exit, right lumbar region, measuring 1 cm x
 1.8, 14 cm from the anterior midline.' (See medico legal necropsy 
report, Exhibit "A"). </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
Early the following morning, the three accused were picked up and 
brought first to the PC Detachment and later, to the PC Headquarters at 
Cawa-Cawa Boulevard where they were interrogated.  The three accused 
denied participation in the killing of Basiri Asimuddin.  They were then
 taken to the PC Crime Laboratory where a parafin examination was 
performed on them by Mrs. Athena Anderson, a forensic chemist of the PC 
Crime Laboratory, Zamboanga City.  The examination showed that the hands
 of accused Ben Santamina and Carlito Magbanua were found positive for 
presence of nitrates or gun powder residue while the hands of Ernesto 
Pinggo yielded nega­tive results, per Exhibit "C"." (<em>Idem</em>, pp. 91-92.)
</p><p>
The only issue raised in the trial court and in this appeal is the 
credibility of witnesses.  The prosecution presented three witnesses to 
the shooting, namely:  Rahma Appang, Macrim Lukman and Albert Sala.  
Leny Rodriguez who owned the store which was patronized by the accused 
and the deceased had transferred her residence at the time of the trial.
  Contradicting the said witnesses were the accused themselves.   Their 
version is "that at about 7:00 P.M. of December 11, 1976 they went down 
from their fishing boat which was then dry docked at Recodo for the past
 five months to buy lemon for their 'kilawin', leaving their vessel 
unguarded.  Upon arrival, Ben Santamina went to the store to buy the 
lemon while Carlito Magbanua and Ernesto Pinggo waited near the road 
side infront of the store.  After Ben Santamina bought the lemon and was
 returning towards his companions, another man arrived and fired three 
times at the man who was standing near the store.  The man fired at 
fell.  Then the one who fired approached the victim and picked up 
something from the fallen man and ran away, while they (the three 
accused) just stood in the place where they were and did not run away 
nor did they help the fallen man.  They do not know who the assailant 
and victim were." (<em>Idem</em>, pp. 92-93.)
</p><p>
The appellants impugn the credibility of Rahma Appang and Macrim Lukman.
  They claim that these were unreliable witnesses because they gave 
contradictory statements about the shooting.
</p><p>
Appang and Lukman did make contradictory statements.
</p><p>
Appang executed an affidavit on December 12, 1976 (Exhibit 1) where she 
stated that she saw ERNING grab the pistol of ASIMUDDIN and that the 
former shot the latter four times.  However, Appang testified during the
 trial that it was Ben Santamina who shot Asimuddin.
</p><p>
Lukman also executed an affidavit on December 12, 1976 (Exhibit 4) where
 he stated that he saw ERNING reach for the gun of ASIMUDDIN and that 
the former shot the latter three times.  However, during the trial 
Lukman, like Appang, declared that it was Santamina who shot Asimuddin.
</p><p>
We have examined Exhibits 1 and 4 carefully and we note the following:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    1. Both affidavits were executed on December 12, 1976.
  </p>
  <p>
    2. Both affidavits were in the form of question and answer and in both the interrogator was Policeman Rogelio P. Carpio.
  </p>
  <p>
    3. Both affidavits were taken in the investigating room of the 462nd PC Company.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Except for minor variants the affidavits are strikingly similar in 
respect of the shooting which leads Us to believe that they were more 
the handiwork of the interrogator.  But this does not mean that the 
cre­dibility of Appang and Lukman has been impaired.  For as the People 
correctly states:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The fact that Appang and Lukman contradicted their previous 
statements does not neces­sarily imply that their testimony in court 
cannot be relied upon.  The previous statements mentioned were taken <em>ex parte</em>
 without the benefit of a formal inquiry.  This Honorable Court has 
always been guarded in binding the witness to such statements.  These 
are 'almost always incomplete and often inaccurate, sometimes from 
partial suggestions and sometimes from the want of suggestions and 
inquiries, without the aid of which the witness may be unable to recall 
the connected collateral cir­cumstances necessary for the correction of 
the first suggestions of his memory, and for his accurate recollection 
of all that belongs to the subject.' (People v. Pacala, 58 SCRA 370, 379
 citing Moore on Facts, 1094-1095 and People v. Tan, et al. 89 Phil. 
337, 341)"

    x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>                x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>                   x x x
  </p>
  <p> "It has been held that the mere fact that a witness declares to a 
certain set of facts and circums­tances during a preliminary examination
 especially where it was not conducted with that degree of impar­tiality
 which should characterize such proceedings, and to another set of facts
 and circumstances upon trial of the case, does not necessarily 
discredit his testimony nor destroy it, if such contradictions are 
satisfactorily explained to the court as in the case at bar.  (People v.
 Rocca, 3 SCRA 828; U.S. v. Lazaro, 34 Phil. 871; U.S. v. Briones, 28 
Phil. 367; U.S. v. Magtibay, 17 Phil. 417)." (Brief, pp. 4, 6.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And the contradictions can easily be explained.  As stated above, the 
answers in both exhibits appear to have been suggested by the 
interro­gator but in another situation where a judge was solemnly 
presiding the true facts emerged.
</p><p>
The decision of the trial court is also assailed on the ground "that it 
was accused-appellant Ben Santamina who fired the gun simply on the 
presence of gunpowder (nitrates) found in his person based on the 
parafin test." (Brief, p. 34.) This contention is erroneous.  The trial 
court based its finding not only on the fact that Santamina was positive
 for gunpowder burns but also on the positive testimony of witnesses.
</p><p>
The appellants' version of the incident is too crude to be con­vincing. 
 No person corroborated their story which coincided in many details so 
that it has all the earmarks of being contrived.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the judgment sentencing Carlito Magbanua and Ernesto Pinggo to suffer <em>reclusion perpetua</em>
 is affirmed but modified in respect of the indemnity which is increased
 to Thirty Thousand (P30,000.00) Pesos.  Costs against the appellants.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
