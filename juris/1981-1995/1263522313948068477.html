The sole issue in this petition for <em>certiorari </em>is whether or 
not a probate court has jurisdiction over parcels of land already 
covered by a Transfer Certificate of Title issued in favor of owners who
 are not parties to the intestate proceedings if the said parcels have 
been included in the inventory of properties of the estate prepared by 
the administrator.
<p>
For a clearer understanding of the present case, the background facts 
may be appreciated. As far back as 1961, Marciano Cuizon applied for the
 registration of several parcels of land located at Opao, Mandaue City 
then covered by Certificates of Tax Declaration in Land Registration 
Case No. N-179. In 1970, he distributed his property bet­ween his two 
children, Rufina and Irene. Part of the property given to Irene 
consisted largely of salt beds which eventually became the subject of 
this controversy.
</p><p>
On December 29, 1971, Irene Cuizon executed a Deed of Sale with 
Reservation of Usufruct involving the said salt beds in favor of the 
petitioners Francisco, Rosita and Purificacion, all surnamed Cuizon. At 
that time, Francisco and Rosita were minors and assisted by their 
mother, Rufina, only sister of Irene. However, the sale was not 
registered because the petitioners felt it was unnecessary due to the 
lifetime usufructuary rights of Irene.
</p><p>
Although the decision in L.R. Case No. N-179 was rendered way back in 
1962, the decree of registration No. N-161246 and the corresponding 
Original Certificate of Title No. 0171 was issued only in 1976 in the 
name of Marciano Cuizon. In that same year, Transfer Certificate of 
Title No. 10477 covering the property in question was issued by the 
Register of Deeds to Irene Cuizon. The latter died in 1978. In the 
extrajudicial settlement of the estate, her alleged half sister and sole
 heir Rufina adjudicated to herself all the property of the decedent 
including the property in question. After the notice of the 
extrajudicial settlement was duly published in a newspaper of general 
circulation, Rufina thereafter, executed a deed of Confirmation of Sale 
wherein she confirmed and ratified the deed of sale of December 29, 1971
 executed by the late Irene and renounced and waived whatever rights, 
interest, and participation she may have in the property in question in 
favor of the petitioners. The deed was duly registered with the Registry
 of Deeds and annotated at the back of TCT No. 10477. Subsequently, TCT 
No. 12665 was issued in favor of the petitioners.
</p><p>
On September 28, 1978, a petition for letters of administration was 
filed before the Court of First Instance of Cebu (Sp. Proc. No. 3864-R) 
by respondent Domingo Antigua, allegedly selected by the heirs of Irene 
numbering seventeen (17) in all to act as administrator of the estate of
 the decedent. The petition was granted.
</p><p>
Respondent Antigua as administrator filed an inventory of the estate of 
Irene. He included in the inventory the property in question which was 
being administered by Juan Arche, one of the petitioners. On June 27, 
1979, respondent Antigua filed a motion asking the court for authority 
to sell the salt from the property and praying that petitioner Arche be 
ordered to deliver the salt to the administrator. The motion was granted
 and respondent court issued the following order:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The administrator, thru this motion, informs the Court that the 
estate owns some beds and fish pond located in Opao, Mandaue City; that 
these salt beds are producing salt which are now in the warehouse in 
Mandaue City, under the custody of Juan Arche; that the value of the 
salt in the warehouse is estimated to be worth P5,000.00 are beginning 
to melt and, unless they are sold as soon as possible, they may 
depricate in value. It is likewise prayed in this motion that Juan Arche
 be ordered to deliver the salt in question to the administ­rator such 
other products of the land now in his (Juan Arche) possession. </p>
  <p align="center">
    xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</p>
  <p> "Let this motion be, as it is hereby GRANTED. The administrator is
 hereby authorized to sell the salt now in the custody of Juan Arche and
 the latter (Juan Arche) is hereby ordered to deliver the salt in 
question to the administrator in order to effect the sale thereof and he
 is likewise directed to deliver such other products of the land to the 
administrator.' </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Subsequently, on three different occasions, respondent Segundo Zambo 
with the aid of several men, sought to enforce the order of the 
respondent court, compelling the petitioners to come to us on 
certiorari. On September 14, 1979, we issued a restraining order 
enjoining the respondents from enforcing the above order of the 
respondent court and from further interfering with the petitioners in 
their peaceful possession and cultivation of the property in question.
</p><p>
The thrust of the petitioners' argument is that the respondent court, as
 a court handling only the intestate proceedings, had neither the 
authority to adjudicate con­troverted rights nor to divest them of their
 possession and ownership of the property in question and hand over the 
same to the administrator. Petitioners further contend that the proper 
remedy of the respondent administrator is to file a separate civil 
action to recover the same.
</p><p>
On the other hand, the respondent administrator banked on the failure of
 the petitioners to first apply for relief in the court of origin before
 filing the present petition. According to him this was a fatal defect. 
In addition, the administrator stated that the deed of sale of December 
29, 1971 lost its efficacy upon the rendition of judgment and issuance 
of the decree in favor of Irene Cuizon.
</p><p>
It is a well-settled rule that a probate court or one in charge of 
proceedings whether testate or intestate cannot adjudicate or determine 
title to properties claimed to be a part of the estate and which are 
equally claimed to belong to outside parties. All that the said court 
could do as regards said properties is to determine whether they should 
or should not be included in the inventory or list of properties to be 
administered by the administrator. If there is no dispute, well and 
good; but if there is, then the parties, the administrator, and the 
opposing parties have to resort to an ordinary action for a final 
determination of the conflicting claims of title because the probate 
court cannot do so (Mallari v. Mallari, 92 Phil. 694; Baquial v. Amihan,
 92 Phil. 501).
</p><p>
Similarly, in <em>Valero Vda. de Rodriguez v. C.A</em>., (91 SCRA 540) 
we held that for the purpose of determining whether a certain property 
should or should not be included in the inventory, the probate court may
 pass upon the title thereto but such determination is not conclusive 
and is subject to the final decision in a separate action regarding 
ownership which may be instituted by the parties (3 Moran's Comments on 
the Rules of Court, 1970 Edition, pages 448-9 and 473; Lachenal v. 
Salas, L-42257, June 14, 1976, 71 SCRA 262, 266).
</p><p>
In the instant case, the property involved is not only claimed by 
outside parties but it was sold seven years before the death of the 
decedent and is duly titled in the name of the vendees who are not party
 to the proceedings. In <em>Bolisay v. Alcid</em>, (85 SCRA 213), this 
Court was confronted with a similar situation. The petitioners therein 
sought to annul the order of the respondent court in a special 
proceeding which in effect ruled that notwithstanding that the subject 
property was duly titled in the name of petitioners, the administratrix 
of the intestate estate involved in said proceeding had the right to 
collect the rentals of said property over the objection of the titled 
owners just because it was included in the inventory of said estate and 
there was an ordinary action in the regular court over the ownership 
thereof and the estate was one of the parties therein. This Court viewed
 the petition as one seeking for a <em>prima facie</em> determination and not a final resolution of the claim of ownership.
</p><p>
We held that:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "xxx Considering that as aforestated the said property is titled 
under the Torrens System in the names of the petitioners, it does appear
 strange, in the light of the probate court's own ruling that it has no 
jurisdiction to pass on the issue of ownership, that the same court 
deemed the same as part of the estate under administration just because 
the administratrix, alleges it is still owned by the estate and has in 
fact listed it in the inventory submitted by her to the court. </p>
  <p> "It does not matter that respondent administratrix has evidence 
purporting to support her claim of ownership, for, on the other hand, 
petitioners have a Torrens title in their favor, which under the law is 
endowed with incontestability until after it has been set aside in the 
manner indicated in the law itself, which, of course, does not include, 
bringing up the matter as a mere incident in special proceedings for the
 settlement of the estate of deceased persons. In other words, in Our 
considered view, the mere inclusion in the inventory submitted by the 
administrator of the estate of a deceased person of a given property 
does not of itself deprive the probate court of authority to inquire 
into the property of such inclusion in case an heir or a third party 
claims adverse title thereto. To hold otherwise would render inutile the
 power of that court to make a <em>prima facie</em> determination of the
 issue of ownership recognized in the above quoted precedents. The 
correct rule is that the probate court should resolve the issue before 
it provisionally, as basis for its inclusion in or exclusion from the 
inventory. It does not even matter that the issue is raised after 
approval of the inventory because "ap­parently, it is not necessary that
 the inventory and appraisal be approved by the Court." (Francisco on 
the Rules of Court Vol. V-B, p. 99, citing Siy Chong Keng v. Collector 
of Internal Revenue, 60 Phil. 494) </p>
  <p> "In regard to such incident of inclusion or exclusion, We hold 
that if a property covered by Torrens Title is involved, the presumptive
 conclusiveness of such title should be given due weight, and in the 
absence of strong compelling evidence to the contrary, the holder 
thereof should be considered as the owner of the property in controversy
 until his title is nullified or modified in an appropriate ordinary 
action, particularly, when as in the case at bar, possession of the 
property itself is in the persons named in the title."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Having been apprised of the fact that the property in question was in 
the possession of third parties and more important, covered by a 
transfer certificate of title issued in the name of such third parties, 
the respon­dent court should have denied the motion of the respondent 
administrator and excluded the property in question from the inventory 
of the property of the estate. It had no authority to deprive such third
 persons of their possession and ownership of the property. Respondent 
court was clearly without jurisdiction to issue the order of June 27, 
1979. Thus, it was unnecessary for the petitioners to first apply for 
relief with the intestate court.
</p><p>
Even assuming the truth of the private respondents' allegations that the
 sale of December 29, 1971 was effected under suspicious circumstances 
and tainted with fraud and that the right of Rufina as alleged 
half-sister and sole heir of Irene remains open to question, these 
issues may only be threshed out in a separate civil action filed by the 
respondent administrator against the petitioners and not in the 
intestate proceedings.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the petition for <em>certiorari </em>is GRANTED and the 
respondent court's order dated June 27, 1979 is hereby set aside and 
declared void as issued in excess of its jurisdiction. Our restraining 
order enjoining the enforcement of the June 27, 1979 order and the 
respondents from further interfering, through the intestate proceedings,
 in the peaceful possession and cultivation of the land in question by 
the petitioners is hereby made PERMANENT.
SO ORDERED.
