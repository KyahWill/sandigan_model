primarily confidential in nature?</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the contention of GSIS that it is the Merit Systems
Protection Board, not the respondent Civil Service Commission that is vested
with jurisdiction to hear and decide cases appealed to it by those aggrieved by
personnel actions of appointing authorities.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is not disputed that "x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>, the Civil Service <span style="">Commission,

however, a need to clarify the jurisdiction of the Commission in relation to
the Merit Systems Board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">One of the relevant laws issued during the past regime is
Presidential Decree No. 1409, creating the Merit Systems Board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Sec. 5 of P.D. 1409<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the Merit Systems Board has, <u>inter</u>

<p class="BODY">The public respondent Civil Service Commission had long
recognized and implemented said provision of P.D. 1409.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1978, it issued Memorandum Circular No. 6 <span style="">where it expressly stated:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"As provided in Presidential Decree No. 1409, which amended
Presidential Decree No. 807, the heads of ministries and agencies, on the one
hand, and the Merit Systems Board on the other, have concurrent original
jurisdiction over disciplinary and non?disciplinary cases and, where the
heads of ministries and agencies assume jurisdiction first, their decisions and
determinations are <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> to the Merit Systems
Board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Civil Service Commission,
however, remains the final administrative appellate body in these matters, as
provided in Section 8 of Presidential Decree No. 1409 x <span class="SpellE">x</span>

<p class="BODY">When the law bestows upon a government body the jurisdiction to
hear and decide cases involving specific matters, it is to be presumed that
such <span style="">jurisdiction is exclusive unless
it be proved that another body is likewise vested with the same jurisdiction,
in which case, both bodies have concurrent jurisdiction over the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Presidential Decree No. 1409 clearly provides
that the Merit Systems Board shall take cognizance of appeals from parties
aggrieved by decisions of appointing officers involving personnel action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commission therefore cannot take original
cognizance of the cases specified under Section 5 of P.D. 1409, except in the
case specified under Section 9 (j) of the Civil Service Decree which directly
gives it such power, to wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">If the Commission were vested with the authority to take original
cognizance of all matters involving government personnel, P.D. 1409 would
appear to be a mere <span class="SpellE">surplusage</span> as the rationale for
the existence of the Merit Systems Protection Board would be rendered
meaningless and inutile.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not the
intention of the law creating the Board.<span style="">&nbsp;

Board was</span></span><span style=""> distinctly
outlined, thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

has become especially critical with the institution in the country of a
Parliamentary form of government that stresses accountability to the people;</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">The
</span>Commission, however, is not without power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the final arbiter on any matter concerning
personnel action in the government, the Commission is empowered by P.D. 1409,

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, We note that the appeal of Salazar was
endorsed by the Review Committee created under Executive Order No. 17 to both
the Merit Systems Board and the Civil Service Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the absence <span style="">of </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">decision from the Merit Systems Board, the
Commission cannot legally assume jurisdiction over the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, its decision (Resolution No. 87-230)

the Order of the Board dated <st1:date year="1988" day="30" month="6">June 30,
 1988</st1:date>, setting aside its previous order upholding the termination of
Salazar in deference to the Commission's final appellate jurisdiction over the
matter, is null and void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jurisdiction
is vested by law and is not lost nor be legally transferred by voluntary
surrender in favor of a body not vested by law with such jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is a disparity between the service record of private
respondent on file with the GSIS and that on file with the CSC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the latter, her last two promotional
appointments in the GSIS were not reflected.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The fact remains however, and this is admitted by both the petitioner
and private respondent Salazar, that before her termination in May 1986, <span style="">she </span>was occupying the last higher
position of Technical Assistant 111 and not of Technical Assistant Aide as
appears in the Commission's records.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner contends that the position of Technical Assistant
111 belongs to the non-career service category and remains co-<span class="SpellE">terminous</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,
it also contends that even if the said position belongs to the career service,
the appointment of Salazar as Technical Assistant 111 is still not valid
because it requires a first grade civil service eligible of which Salazar was
not at the time of her appointment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The resolution of the nature of the appointment of Salazar as
Technical Assistant 111, i.e., whether or not the position is primarily
confidential is necessary in the resolution of the legality of her
termination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether the position of
Technical Assistant 111 belongs to the career service where the incumbent
enjoys a security of tenure or primarily confidential where her tenure is co-<span class="SpellE">terminous</span> with that of the appointing authority or endures
only as long as confidence in her exists (See <span class="SpellE">Pacete</span>
v. Acting Chairman of COA, et al., G. R. No. 39456, 7 May 1990) depends upon
the nature of the functions of the office (<span class="SpellE">Borres</span> v.
Court of Appeals, <span style="">L-3</span>6845, August
21, 1987).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not even the fact that the
position had already been classified as one under the career service and
certified as permanent by the Civil Service Commission, can conceal or alter a
positions' being <span style="">confidential in </span>nature (See Hon. <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Grino</span>, et al. v. CSC, et al., G.R. No. 91602,
February 26, 1991).</p>

<p class="BODY">However, the records with the court are not sufficient for a
substantial determination of the matter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is <span class="GramE"><span style="">no </span>copy
of the job description of the position nor</span> any showing by the parties as
regards the nature of the position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Board initially ruled that the position is primarily confidential and upheld
the legality of Salazar's termination.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Its decision however, is only a conclusion not supported by
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent Civil Service
Commission, on the other hand, did not make <span style="">any </span>finding on this matter after concluding that based on its
records, Salazar's last position is only that of a Technical Aide, a permanent
position and very much lower than that of Technical Assistant 111.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For his part, the Solicitor General admits
that the position is confidential in nature but did not bother to explain
why.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The GSIS, the other hand states
that the position is confidential but inconsistently contends also that Salazar
had no first grade civil service eligibility required of the position.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the petition is granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The questioned Resolution of the Civil
Service Commission is annulled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
