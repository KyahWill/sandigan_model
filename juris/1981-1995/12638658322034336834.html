				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This petition for <i>certiorari</i> seeks to review the decision
of respondent National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC for short) dated July
26, 1989 in NLRC Case No. 7-2901-86 entitled, "Jimmy A. <span class="SpellE">Megino</span> v. Manila Electric Company," ordering the
reinstatement of private respondent Jimmy <span class="SpellE">Megino</span>,
thereby reversing the order dated June 28, 1988 of Labor Arbiter <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span> C. Mendoza who found that <span class="SpellE">Megino</span>
was dismissed for cause.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Megino</span> was employed as a teller of the
petitioner, Manila Electric Company (MERALCO for short), at its San Pedro
Branch Office, in San Pedro, Laguna.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His
job was to collect and/or receive electric bill payments from <span class="SpellE">Meralco's</span> customers and to remit the same to the company
before the end of each day (p. 5, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="2" month="12">December 2, 1985</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Megino</span> was placed under preventive suspension pending
the results of an administrative investigation of his <span class="SpellE">unremitted</span>
collections amounting to P1<span class="GramE">,864.89</span> as of <st1:date year="1985" day="10" month="9">September 10, 1985</st1:date>, and for his

investigation conducted by officers of the company (p. 7, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">While the administrative investigation was pending, petitioner's
auditors proceeded with their task of ascertaining the extent of <span class="SpellE">Megino's</span> shortage (p. 7, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Megino</span> admitted having collected the
sums of P1,864.89 and P3,763.51 but imputed to <span class="SpellE">Myle</span> <span class="SpellE">Calayag</span> (a former bill collector of the company's San Pedro
Branch Office, who had earlier been dismissed for dishonesty) his failure to
remit the funds (p. 7, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Having been found guilty as charged, <span class="SpellE">Megino</span>
was dismissed on <st1:date year="1986" day="12" month="2">February 12, 1986</st1:date>.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On April 28, 1986, petitioner's audit team rendered a Final Audit
Report No. 86-012 disclosing that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">over
the years <span class="SpellE">Megino</span> had in fact misappropriated the
total sum of P63,967.15 (p. 8, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="16" month="7">July 16, 1986</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Meralco</span> denied <span class="SpellE">Megino's</span>
request for reconsideration of the order for his dismissal from the
company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It held that he violated the
company's Code of Employee Discipline, particularly Section 7, paragraph 1, by
"misappropriating or withholding Company funds," the penalty for which
is dismissal from the service (p. 10, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="23" month="7">July 23, 1986</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Megino</span> filed a complaint for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">illegal </span>dismissal against <span class="SpellE">Meralco</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was docketed as NLRC Case No. <span class="GramE">NCR-7-2901-86 (pp. 100-101, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1988" day="28" month="6">June
 28, 1988</st1:date>, Labor Arbiter <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span> C.
Mendoza dismissed the complaint for lack of merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Labor Arbiter pointed out:</p>

<p class="2Q">"Noteworthy is the fact that with respect to these charges, he
was given all the opportunity to defend and absolve himself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, in every investigation
that took place against him, he was given the full opportunity to explain his
side and was shown the different derogatory reports and exhibits against him
and for all those investigations he was assisted by a representative of the
MERALCO Employees and Workers Association (MEWA) to (sic) which he is a
member.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, from the text of the
investigation reports - even if he insists on being innocent, he cannot absolve
himself from the implication of the charges and for that reason, nobody
including this Official can blame respondent for having withdrawn its trust and
confidence on (sic) the complainant, and for having dismissed him on that basis
which is a just cause for dismissal under the Labor Code.</p>

dismissing the complaint for lack of merit.</p>

petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition alleging that the NLRC committed
grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction in reversing the
decision of the Labor Arbiter and in holding that <span class="SpellE">Megino</span>
was illegally dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The central issue is whether <span class="SpellE">Megino's</span>
infractions of the Code of Discipline were sufficient grounds for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">terminating his employment for loss of

<p class="BODY">We find merit in the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Myle</span> <span class="SpellE">Calayag's</span>
admission that he authored the <span class="GramE">misappropriation</span> of company
funds did not relieve <span class="SpellE">Megino</span> as custodian of the
funds, of liability for the defalcation, for it was he, not <span class="SpellE">Calayag</span>,
who was accountable for them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It appears
that he connived and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">conspired with <span class="SpellE">Calayag</span> to steal his collections.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Calayag</span> <u>prepared</u>

which enabled <span class="SpellE">Megino</span> to secrete the funds in his
possession.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Megino</span>
occupied a very sensitive position which required a high degree of honesty and
trustÂ­worthiness (p. 187, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His acts of dishonesty justified the
company's loss of trust and confidence in him and his consequent discharge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> Consolidated Mining Co. v.
Court of Appeals (1 SCRA 1251), we held that where an employee occupies a
position of trust and confidence, as where he is entrusted with confidential or
delicate matters, or with the custody, handling, or care and protection of the
employer's property, acts tending to show unworthiness may constitute a just
cause for dismissal, or loss of employer's confidence.</p>

<p class="2Q">It is fairly well settled in this jurisdiction that, for loss of
trust and confidence to constitute <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>just
and valid cause for an employee's dismissal, proof beyond reasonable doubt of
the latter's commission of irregularities is not needed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is sufficient that there be some basis for
the same, or that the employer has reasonable ground <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt">to </span>believe that the employee is responsible for the misconduct
and his participation therein renders him unworthy of the trust and confidence
demanded of his position (Reyes v. Zamora, 90 SCRA 92).</p>
