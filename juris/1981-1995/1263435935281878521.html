<p class="BODY">The prosecution showed that at about eleven o'clock in the
morning of August 23, 1984, a group consisting of Roland Yap, Enrique Paras,
Santos Origenes, Victor Lim, Generoso Tumulac, Jr., and Dominador Sobroso went
to the Egg and Eye Restaurant in Quezon City.  Roger A. Llabres, who was working there as a security guard, did not
allow them to enter because the restaurant was already closed.  Yap asked Llabres to let them in anyway as
he was a regular customer.  Llabres
refused.  A heated argument followed,
leading to a near-fist fight which was defused when Paras intervened.  He persuaded Yap to just leave with
them.  The group then proceeded to the
waiting shed about 10 meters away to wait for a taxi.  Llabres entered the restaurant.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After about five minutes, the group heard somebody behind them
shout, "Putang ina ninyo!" Without looking back, Yap retorted,
"Putang ina n'yo rin!" Suddenly, Llabres attacked Yap with a
bolo.  Yap fell but Llabres continued
hacking him even when he was already on the ground.  When Paras sought to wrest the bolo, Llabres turned on him,
wounding him in the forehead and his left wrist.  Llabres next attacked Origenes, hitting the latter's left arm,
right armpit and right thigh.  Lim moved
to help his companions, but he was hit in the mouth when some seven or eight
men armed with bolos came out of the restaurant and started throwing bottles at
them.  It was at this point that they
fled, leaving the fallen Yap behind.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY" style="tab-stops:135.0pt">Llabres had <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>different story.  He says that in the evening of August 23,
1984, Yap and Paras went to the Egg and Eye Restaurant, where he was working as
a security guard.  As they were leaving
at 1 o'clock in the morning, one of the waitresses asked him to detain them
because they had not yet paid their bill.  The bill was finally settled with the restaurant manager.  Yap, still resentful, coldly told the
waitress to "eat the change."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">But that was not the end of the incident.  Yap and Paras came back after thirty minutes
with five other men.  They all had
bolos.  Yap told him to call the manager
immediately or he himself would be killed.  Llabres's reaction was to run to the waiting shed as he was not carrying
his gun.  But the group followed and
then surrounded him.  Yap made a stab at
him with his bolo, but Llabres was able to parry the thrust and to wrest the
weapon.  Yap stepped back and pulled a
kitchen knife but before he could use it, Llabres fell upon him with the bolo
and continued hacking him.  He also
defended himself from Paras and Origenes when they tried to help Yap.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Llabres later surrendered to the police and admitted hacking the
three victims.  He also turned over the
bolo he had used in attacking them.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Yap died as a result of shock and massive hemorrhage.  The autopsy revealed that he had sustained
21 wounds in all, 10 hack wounds and 2 incised wounds at the back and 8 hack <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">wounds and 1 incised wound in the front of
his body.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

to pay the costs.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The question in this
appeal is one of credibility.  We will
decide it as the trial court did, in favor of the prosecution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The appellant's version
is an improbable tale.  He would have us
believe that eight men with intent to kill, and all armed with bolos for the
purpose, ganged up on him that night.  He himself was unarmed, but he was able to snatch Yap's bolo.  Single-handed, he fought off his attackers,
all eight of them, inflicting fatal wounds on Yap, nearly killing Paras, and
also wounding Origenes.  The armed men
finally fled in fear.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Here is a veritable Rambo straight from the movies.  Unarmed at first, he repulsed eight armed
men determined to kill him, each carrying a bolo, not to mention the kitchen
knife Yap drew when the appellant snatched his bolo.  Surprisingly, all of them hardly touched Llabres, who in the end killed
one of them, nearly killed another, and wounded two others.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">No one corroborated
Llabres.  Investigators found no kitchen
knife at the scene of the crime.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Under the first paragraph
of Article 11 of the Revised Penal Code, a plea of self-defense will prosper
only when it is shown that there was: (a) unlawful aggression on the part of
the victim; (b) reasonable necessity of the means employed by the accused </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">prevent or repel such unlawful aggression; and (c) lack of sufficient
provocation on the part of the person defending himself.  These circumstances must concur.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Only Llabres testified that it was Yap who began the aggression,
and there is no corroboration either of his claim that he offered no
provocation.  The appellant's testimony
was disbelieved by the trial court, which chose to give credence to Victor Lim
and Enrique Paras, the eyewitnesses for the prosecution, who gave a different
report of the incident.</p>

<p class="BODY">Assuming there was unlawful aggression on the part of Yap, the
Court nevertheless cannot accept that there was a reasonable necessity for the
means employed by Llabres to prevent or repel such aggression.  Yap was struck <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">twenty-one</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> times.  </span>He had 12 wounds <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">in </span>the back and 9 wounds in the front
of his body.  By Llabres's own admission,
he kept hacking at Yap even when his victim was already helpless on the ground.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
The number of wounds alone, let alone their nature, shows all too clearly that
Llabres was not merely defending himself but needlessly striking at an already
dying person.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense faults the prosecution for not presenting Origenes
and deduces sinister motives from this omission.  It is the prerogative of each party to choose its own witnesses
in accordance with its own assessment of the evidence it needs to prove its
case.  We do not find that the
non-presentation of Origenes has weakened the prosecution.  If the defense felt that Origenes could
support its own cause, there was nothing to prevent it from calling him as its
own witness.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court correctly appreciated the qualifying circumstance
of treachery in the murder of Yap, who was suddenly attacked from behind and
sustained eleven hack wounds in the back.  Even if <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Yap </span>did hear
Llabres shout, "Putang ina ninyo!" the expletive was not sufficient
warning that his life was in danger and that he would be suddenly attacked with
a bolo.  Judge Ortiz was also correct in
rejecting the aggravating circumstance of evident premeditation.  By the prosecution's own account, only five <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">minutes elapsed from the time Llabres entered
the restaurant until he reappeared to attack Yap and his companions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">But it was not correct to
consider against the appellant the aggravating circumstance of cruelty.  According to Article 14 (21) of the Revised </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Penal </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">Code, there is cruelty when the wrong done in the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">commission </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the crime is
deliberately augmented by causing another wrong which is not necessary for its
commission.  This has not been shown in
the case at bar.  Llabres did not
deliberately prolong the physical suffering of his victim; on the contrary, his
repeated blows show that he intended to kill Yap as soon as he could.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Llabres is, of course, entitled to the mitigating circumstance of
voluntary surrender in all the three cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 64 of the Revised Penal Code pertinently provides:</p>

<blockquote>Article 64.  <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Rules for the application of penalties which contain three periods</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">. - </span>In cases in which the penalties
prescribed by law contain three periods, whether it be a single divisible
penalty or composed of three different penalties, each one of which forms a
period in accordance with the provisions of Articles 76 and 77, the court shall
observe for the application of the penalty the following rules, according to
whether there are or are not mitigating or aggravating circumstances:</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When only a mitigating
circumstance is present in the commission of the act, they shall impose the
penalty in its minimum period."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The penalty for murder is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">reclusion
temporal</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> in </span>its maximum
period to death.   In Criminal Case No.
Q-35263, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">therefore, in view of the
mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender and the absence of any
aggravating circumstance, the appropriate penalty is the indeterminate sentence
of from ten (10) years and six (6) months of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">prision mayor</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">, </span>as
minimum, to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">reclusion temporal</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">, </span>as
maximum.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court erred in not appreciating the mitigating
circumstance of voluntary surrender in Criminal Case No. Q-35261 and No.
Q-35262.</p>

<p class="BODY">There being no aggravating circumstance in both cases, and
applying Article 64 in connection with Articles 50 and 51 of the Revised Penal
Code, as well <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>Section 1 of
the Indeterminate Sentence Law (RA 4103, as amended), we hereby impose on the
appellant in Criminal Case No. Q-35261 the indeterminate sentence of from two
(2) years and four (4) months of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">prision
