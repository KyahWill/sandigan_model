<p class="BODY">Basically, appellant submits that his guilt <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">has </span>not been proven beyond reasonable
doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He assails the credibility of the
two arresting officers as witnesses for the prosecution, pointing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">to </span>inconsistencies and alleged
improbabilities in their respective testimonies. It is claimed that while Patrolman
<span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Pedria</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>testified <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

operation (TSN, April 26, 1984, p. 4), Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Puchero</span>
states that there were three of them, including his informer (TSN, October 31,
1984, p. 6).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant also insists that
since the arresting officers do not know alias JOHN LENNON as the person to be
arrested, they could not be honestly believed in their declarations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He finally submits that, in reality, no such
buying and selling of marijuana ever occurred and that he was a victim of the
two arresting <span class="GramE">officers</span> eagerness to please their
commanding officers in arresting anybody who may be pointed to them as alias
JOHN LENNON.</p>

<p class="BODY">After <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">having </span>gone
through the records, <span class="GramE">We</span> find no reason to alter the
trial court's ruling.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As correctly noted
by the Solicitor General <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">in </span>his
Brief, the issue involved here is one of credibility of witnesses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And like the trial court, <span class="GramE">We</span>
believe the prosecution's version and uphold the credibility of its witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a settled principle of evidence in this <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">jurisdiction </span>that findings of fact and
credibility of witnesses by the trial <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">court
are </span>entitled to great weight and respect on appeal (People v. <span class="SpellE">Millarpe</span>, 134 SCRA 555; Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">v. </span>CA, 149 SCRA 32; People v. <span class="SpellE">Taduyo</span>, 154 SCRA 350; People v. <span class="SpellE">Francia</span>,
154 SCRA 495).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Finding no indiscretion
on the part of the trial court, <span class="GramE">We</span> apply the above
legal tenet to the case at bar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But even
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">if </span>such principle were not
invoked the fact is that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the </span>appellant
failed to controvert the more credible evidence of the prosecution pointing to
the fact that the former actually sold to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Pat.
<span class="SpellE">Puchero</span> marijuana leaves for ten pesos (P10.00) in
violation of RA 6425, Sec. 4.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While
there may be some contradictions in the testimonies of the arresting officers
as to incidents in carrying out the buy-bust operation, such are minor and do
not affect their credibility (People v. <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span>, 135
SCRA 84; People v. <span class="SpellE">Dava</span>, 149 SCRA 582).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And contrary to the appellant's claim, the
evidence shows that Pat. <span class="SpellE">Puchero</span>, </span>who <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">posed as buyer, came to know the person of
alias JOHN LENNON through his confidential informer while he was conducting
surveillance activities prior to the actual buy--bust operation (see TSN, </span><st1:date year="1984" day="31" month="10"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">October

8).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The best evidence the appellant
could have presented, aside from his self-serving declarations, are the
testimonies of his tricycle driver friends </span>who <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">allegedly witnessed his arrest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As the trial court fittingly observed:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><i>"He could have supported this
allegation by presenting his two friends, the tricycle drivers Boy and <span class="SpellE">Kiko</span>, who, according to his testimony </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">were </span>present when he was apprehended
by the two policemen, since they were conversing at that time.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><i>‘An accused <span class="GramE">persons</span> runs the risk of an
inference against him because of his failure to produce evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Unless the failure to produce evidence is
explained away, the inference is that the tenor of the specific <span class="SpellE">unproduced</span> evidence would not support his case.’ (People v.
</i><st1:city><st1:place><i>Santos</i></st1:place></st1:city><i>, 91 Phil, </i>320)</p>

<blockquote><i>Rule 131, Sec. 5 includes among the
disputable presumptions the following: ‘</i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">(RTC Decision, p. 20, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Having failed in this respect, the above
presumption made by law operates against appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All these taken together create a moral
certainty as to appellant's guilt, compelling us to affirm the trial court's
ruling.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a last ditch effort to avoid liability, appellant attacks the<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>arresting <span class="GramE">officers</span>
motive in apprehending him. However, appellant's allegations remain
unfounded.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As such, the legal
presumption that official duty has been regularly performed (Rule 131, Sec.
5(6)) stands.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, as pointed
out by the Solicitor General 'there is no showing that prosecution witnesses...
had any ill-motive against and falsely accused appellant, considering the
gravity of the offense charged... As such, their testimonies cannot be
discredited where no motive is shown why they would frame up the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(People v. Lim, 71 SCRA 249 [1976])." <span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
