				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal originally filed with the Court of Appeals
seeking the reversal of the Decision of the Court of First Instance of Rizal in
Civil Case No. 16885, dismissing the Complaint for Quieting of Title,
Cancellation of TCT No. 869987 and all subsequent titles derived under it with
damages, on the ground of <u>res</u> <u>judicata</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals certified the case to this Court as the same
involves a pure question of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">law.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY">The following facts are undisputed - Ramon Florentino, as
original owner of a parcel of residential land with improvements thereon
located at San Juan, Rizal and covered by TCT No. 30714, mortgaged the same <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">to the </span>Development Bank of the
Philippines (DBP).  On December 11,
1954, Florentino executed a Deed of Sale with assumption of mortgage in favor
of Rev. Balbino Caparas over the aforesaid property.  On July 27, 1960, the said property was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">foreclosed by </span>the DBP due to the inability of Florentino (and
Caparas) to continue payments of the obligations therefor.  On December 29, 1960, Caparas wrote the DBP
requesting permission to redeem the property on the ground that a Deed of Sale
with assumption of mortgage was executed by Florentino in his favor and
deposited P1,494.21 for the purpose.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, before DBP could act upon the request of Caparas, said
bank received a letter from Florentino claiming that the deed of sale in favor
of Caparas is null and void for lack of consideration and that as the
registered owner, he must be allowed to redeem the property.  On January 27, 1961, the DBP informed
Florentino of the offer made by Caparas.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, on January 18, 1961,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Ramon <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Florentino received </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">One </span>Thousand Five Hundred Pesos

13.0pt">purchase price of the aforesaid property.  On January 31, 1961, Florentino executed a Deed of Absolute Sale
with assumption of mortgage in favor of Sangalang.  The said Deed was registered on the same <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">date.</span></span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On February 2, 1961, DBP again received a
letter from Florentino reiterating his offer of redemption, enclosing a
Philippine National Bank (PNB) check for P2,800.00.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> On February 10, 1961, DBP informed Caparas
that Florentino is questioning the validity of the sale in favor of the latter
and returned the P1,494.21.  On February
16, 1961, DBP received another letter from Florentino asking the DBP to hold
the P2,800.00 until the question of ownership is finally settled by a competent
court.  On February 28, 1961, the DBP
received a letter from Andrea Sangalang informing the bank that the mortgaged
property was sold in her favor by Florentino and enclosed of sale and informed
the bank that the check of P2,800.00 came from her.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">5-a</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On May 10, 1961, the DBP received a letter from Caparas' lawyer,
Atty. Alcazar, claiming that only Caparas can redeem the property.  The bank in turn informed Atty. Alcazar that
the bank cannot entertain any offer to redeem the property until the rightful <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">ownership of the same shall have been
determined by a competent court.  On May
11, 1961, Caparas registered the sale dated December 11, 1954, in his favor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, it appears that the same property was attached
and sold at public auction in favor of Jorge Pascua<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
as judgment creditor of Ramon <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Florentino,
who </span>also manifested his desire to redeem the property.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 23, 1961, Caparas filed a suit for Specific Performance
with Consignation, against the DBP before the Court of First Instance of Rizal,
docketed as Civil <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Case No. </span>6685,
raising the issue of "who among Sangalang, Pascua and Caparas has a better
right to redeem the property in question”.  Sangalang and Pascua intervened while Florentino was impleaded as a
party.  During the trial, Sangalang
vehemently denied knowledge of the prior sale in favor of Caparas "at the
time of the sale in her favor", but admitted <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">in </span>court that she registered her lien only upon her knowledge of
Caparas' claim over the property.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
The Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Caparas,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
finding that Sangalang was not <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>purchaser
in good faith:</p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">"We </span>find, and
so hold, that appellant Sangalang does not fulfill <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">the requirement of a purchaser in good </span>faith.  Further, We agree with the findings of the lower
court on this points, that:<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"With <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">regard </span>to Andrea Sangalang's claim <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">intervention, there are at least two reasons why the sale to Miss
Sangalang cannot be given legal effect:  (1) At the time of the alleged sale on January 31, 1961, neither
defendant </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">Florentino </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">nor plaintiff </span>was
the owner of the property, the Development Bank <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">of the Philippines having bought the same on foreclosure sale,
plaintiff had </span>already acquired the property from Florentino under a
valid deed of sale dated Dec. 1, 1954.  It may be that the mortgage indebtedness remained in the books of the
Bank as that of Florentino but between his and the plaintiff, the latter had
become the owner of the property and had assumed the obligation.  (2) There is ample evidence indicating bad
faith on the part of Florentino and Andrea Sangalang.  In the case of the latter, it is evident in the following
circumstance:  (a) Miss Sangalang's
knowledge of the prior unregistered sale to plaintiff-Sangalang herself
admitted that it was only after she had learned of plaintiff's claim that she
had caused her affidavit of Adverse Claim to be registered.  This knowledge on her part is equivalent to
registration because the purpose of the law has thereby been achieved.  The Torrens System cannot be used as a shield
for the commission of fraud.  (b)
Sangalang's representation to the tenants (Exh. ‘9’ Sangalang, Exh. 'Q' -
plaintiff) that she had acquired the property from <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">Rev.</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> </span><u>Fr</u>.
<u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Caparas</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> </span>(not Florentino) is a clear admission
of the latter's preferred right.  (c) Florentino's
letters to D.B.P. dated Jan. 23, Feb. 2, and Feb. 16, (Exh. 6, 7 and 11 DBP)
offering to redeem the property and enclosing PNB Cashier's Check No. 1787110
dated Feb. 1, 1961, in the amount of P2,800.00 which came from Sangalang, as
admitted by her in her letter to the DBP dated Feb. 20, 1961 present
circumstances of suspicion, inconsistent with good faith especially if <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">we </span>are to consider that on Jan. 19,
1961, Sangalang had already paid Florentino the sum of P1,500.00 as part of the
purchase price.  Further­more, if so
alleged by her she did <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">some </span>verification
regarding the property from the Bank and was issued a statement of account she
must have learned that on Dec. 20, 1960 plaintiff had already requested the
Bank to allow him to repurchase the property.  (Exh. 4-DBP).  (3) The contention
that Sangalang was first in possession is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">untenable
because plaintiff since the sale in 1954 has been in juridical possession.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On appeal<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>,
the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision <u>in</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">toto</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">.  </span>In due time, the Decision became
final and executory.  In accordance with
the Decision, the DBP sold the property in question to Caparas who registered
the same with the Register of Deeds of Rizal.  Consequently TCT 30714 and 269981 in the name of Florentino and DBP,
respectively, were cancelled and a new title, TCT 3046763,<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> was issued in the name of Caparas, free from
all liens.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On November 4, 1977, Andrea Sangalang filed a Complaint<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
for Quieting of Title, Cancellation of TCT 269987 and all subsequent titles
derived under it before the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal, against
Balbino Caparas, the DBP and the Register of Deeds of Rizal, with a prayer for
compensatory and moral damages.  During
the trial, the parties agreed with the observations of the court that the documentary
and testimonial evidence adduced in Civil Case No. 6885 and the Memoranda of
the respective parties be considered sufficient basis for deciding the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 26, 1973, the lower court rendered a decision
dismissing the Complaint and the counterclaim on the ground that the present
case is barred by prior judgment in Civil Case No. 6685.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, the Court of Appeals decreed that the issues raised
are pure questions of law and, therefore, beyond its jurisdiction.  In addition, the Court observed that the
only factual issue raised on appeal is the basis of the alleged good faith of
appellant Andrea Sangalang.  The
Appellate Court decreed that the said issue had been fully discussed in CA-G.R.
No. 33952-R, where the said Court declared Sangalang not to be a purchaser in
good faith.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is now contended by appellant Sangalang that the lower court
erred:</p>

ANDREA SANGALANG ACTED IN BAD FAITH IN THE PURCHASE OF THE <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">PROPERTY IN QUESTION.”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellant contends that the principle of <u>res</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">judicata</span></u> is inapplicable on the
ground that there is no identity of causes of action in Civil Case No. 6685 and
16885 in that in the former case for specific performance and consignation, the
cause of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">action was </span>DBP's
refusal to allow Balbino Caparas to redeem the foreclosed property whereas in
the latter, it is to quiet title over the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">property
redeemed by Caparas by virtue of a valid deed of sale in her (appellant) favor
on the premise that the land in question being a registered land and the sale
in her favor having been registered in good faith, convey upon her title over
the property in question.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We are of the opinion and so hold, that the appeal now before Us
is already barred by the final judgment in Civil Case No. 6685.  The test of identity of causes of action
lies not in the form of an action but on whether the same evidence would
support and establish the former and the present causes of action.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
The difference of actions in the aforesaid cases is of no moment.  It has been held that a party cannot by
varying the form of action or adopting a different method of presenting his
case, escape the operation of the principle that one and the same cause of action
shall not be twice litigated between the same parties and their privies.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The special circumstance in this case which triggered both
parties to litigate is their conflicting interests over the property in
question which was brought about by the double sales executed in their favor by
Florentino, the original owner.  It will
be recalled that on the basis of the evidence presented <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in </span>the previous case, which is the
same set of evidence that appellant proposed to present in the case now under
review, appellant's defense of priority of registration of the sale in the
previous case was declared ineffective after it was duly established that at
the time of appellant's registration of the sale, appellant was already aware
of the previous sale in favor of Caparas, the knowledge of which was correctly
declared as equivalent to registration in favor of Caparas.  The aforesaid findings of the lower court
were<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> </span>affirmed <u>in</u> <u>toto</u>
by the Court of Appeals, the decision of which became final and executory.</p>

<p class="BODY">When a right or fact has been judicially tried and determined by
a court of competent jurisdiction, or an opportunity for such trial has been
given, the judgment of the court, so long as it remains unreversed, should be
con­clusive upon the parties, and those in privity with them in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">law and estate.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> Thus the claim of the appellant having </span>been
denied as she was found to be in bad faith, appellant is now barred from
raising the same issue by varying the cause of action.  Said issue is no longer subject to review by
any court.  The law cannot allow parties
to trifle with the courts.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">foregoing
discussion, appellant's argu­</span>ment that she has acquired title over the
property in question by virtue of her previous registration thereof and
therefore the decision in Civil Case No. 6685 should have directed for its
cancellation is likewise untenable.  The
fact that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">court failed to provide
for cancellation of appellant's claim is immaterial.  First, as above observed, the declaration that appellant's knowledge
of the previous sale in favor of Caparas </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">equivalent to
registration, simply means that the annotation of her claim thereof, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">is </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">of no force and effect, thus an order for its cancellation is not
necessary.  Second, upon the finality of
the judgment in favor of Caparas, he is entitled to registration thereof.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> Thus on the basis of said judgment, DBP
allowed Caparas to redeem the property in question.  It should be borne in mind, that Caparas is not an ordinary
redemptioner but a “</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">vendee </span><u>a</u>
<u>retro</u>”, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">so the argument that a
redemption does not neces­sarily make him the owner thereof will not hold true
under the special circumstances of this case.  Caparas having redeemed the property by virtue of a valid deed of redemp­tion
and consequently acquiring </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">title
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">thereto free from all liens and
encumbrances, appellant cannot successfully seek the cancellation of his title
thereto.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The finding of bad faith on the part of appellant in the
acquisition and registration of the questioned property in the previous case is
final and may not be reopened.  And
contrary to the pretension of appellant that the same is based on surmises and
conclusions, a reading shows it was arrived at based on the evidence before the
Court.</p>
