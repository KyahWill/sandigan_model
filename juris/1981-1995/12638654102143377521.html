				<H3>FNCB FINANCE, PETITIONER, VS. NAPOLEON ESTAVILLO, RESPONDENT. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CRUZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Installment sales and financing arrangements have become part of the
modern way of life, especially in the metropolitan areas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By such transactions, persons who do not have
the ready cash for the total purchase pr<span style="">ice
</span>may make a small down payment, leaving the balance to be
"financed," or amortized over a stipulated period with interests and
other charges added.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The resultant total
payments are way above the original cost.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nevertheless, the buyer agrees to the onerous terms, albeit not without <span style="">a little </span>misgiving,
as he would otherwise be unable <span style="">to </span>make
the purchase at all.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of Napoleon <span class="SpellE">Estavillo</span>, the
subject of the sale was a brand-new Ford <span class="SpellE">Fiera</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He bought it from World Cars, Inc. on <st1:date year="1982" day="22" month="4">April 22, 1982</st1:date>, for the list price of
P63,340.00 and made a down payment of P15,340.00, leaving a balance of
P48,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was to be paid under a
2-year financing scheme at the rate of P2,946.00 monthly from June 14, 1982 to
May 14, 1984, bloating the balance to P70,704.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the promissory note he signed, <span class="SpellE">Estavillo</span> agreed to pay a 2.5% penalty in case of late
payment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The instrument also contained
an acceleration clause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To secure
payment of the loan, he and his wife had to execute a chattel mortgage on <st1:date year="1982" day="14" month="5">May 14, 1982</st1:date>, on the purchased
vehicle in favor of World Cars, Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
that same day, the Ford <span class="SpellE">Fiera</span> was delivered to <span class="SpellE">Estavillo</span>, and World Cars Inc. assigned its credit against
him to FNCB Finance, the herein petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1984" day="28" month="2"><span style="">February
 28, 1984</span></st1:date><span style="">, the
vehicle was seized </span><span style="">in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">San Mateo</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>, by two
employees of the petitioner, Jun Cruz and Jun <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>,
together with John Ramos, deputy sheriff of the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>, who took it to <span class="SpellE">Echague</span>,
in the same province.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Estavillo</span> immediately saw Andy <span class="SpellE">Cacho</span>,
manager of FNCB in that branch, and demanded the reason for the confiscation of
the car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was told he was in arrears
for two months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Estavillo</span>
denied this, insisting he paid P9,390.00 to Jun <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>
on </span><st1:date year="1983" day="26" month="8"><span style="">August 26, 1983</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner nevertheless refused to return
the Ford <span class="SpellE">Fiera</span>, prompting the private respondent to
send </span>a <span style="">letter of demand through
counsel on </span><st1:date year="1984" day="27" month="3"><span style="">March 27, 1984</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span class="SpellE">Cacho</span> relented and promised to return the vehicle as long
as <span class="SpellE">Estavillo</span> continued paying his installments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, that promise was never
fulfilled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The vehicle was sold at
public auction and delivered to FNCB <span style="">as
</span>the highest bidder, then taken by it to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
and thence to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>, where it was
ultimately resold.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Estavillo</span> sued. FNCB countered that the
repossession of the car was legal because he was in arrears.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After trial, the plaintiff was sustained by
the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
which held the seizure of the car was not warranted because <span class="SpellE">Estavillo</span>
was not delinquent in his installment payments.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the decision read:</p>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered in
favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant ordering the defendant to pay
to the plaintiff the amount of P64,895.00 representing the payments made by the
purchase <span style="">of </span>the vehicle which
it confiscated with interest at 10% from February 28, 1984; P5,000.00 as
nominal damages and P10<span style="">,000.00 </span>as
exemplary damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs against the
defendant.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, the decision was affirmed <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">toto</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>by the respondent court,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
which is now the subject of this petition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is alleged that:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In affirming the decision of the lower court
that respondent was not in default on his account, the Court of Appeals erred
in disregarding facts and evidence showing that respondent was in fact, in
default;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals erred in affirming the
lower court's decision that payment made to petitioner's employee evidenced by <span style="">a </span>private receipt (not official
company receipt) may be deemed <span style="">as </span>payment
to the company;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals erred in affirming the
lower court's decision ordering the petitioner to return all the payments made
by respondent on his installment account;</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals erred in affirming the
lower court's decision ordering the petitioner to pay the respondent nominal
damages;</blockquote>

<blockquote>5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals erred in affirming the
lower court's decision ordering the petitioner to pay the respondent exemplary
damages.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the first issue, we restate at the outset the well-established
principle that this Court is not a <span class="SpellE">trier</span> of
facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In an appeal by <i><u><span style="">certiorari</span></u></i><span style=""> </span>under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court,
"only questions of law may be raised," <span style="">as </span>the Rule itself <span style="">says.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The resolution of factual issues is
the function of the lower courts, whose findings on these matters are received
with respect and are in fact binding on this Court except only where the case
is shown as coming under the accepted exceptions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no such showing here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, we accept the ruling of the
trial court, as reviewed and affirmed by the respondent court, that the private
respondent was up-to-date in his installment payments at the time of the
seizure of the subject vehicle.</p>

<p class="BODY">It need only be added that the petitioner's statement of accounts
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 4) was correctly rejected by <span style="">the </span><span style="">trial </span><span style="">court for the
several discrepancies therein that showed it could not be relied upon to show, <span style="">as </span>urged by the petitioner, that the
private respondent w</span><span style="">as in </span><span style="">default.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As the trial court observed:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Moreover, the statement of account (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
4) cannot be given full faith and credit, since it does not record all the
payments made by plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it does not reflect the correct unpaid
balance of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> at the time of the seizure of the
vehicle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notably, the payments on
January 6, 1982 in the amount of P2,500.00 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. N);
and in August, 1983, in the amount of P9,390.00 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
C) are not recorded in Exhibit 4. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>On May
3, 1983, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> paid the amount of P1,800.00 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. S) but only P1,000.00 appears in Exhibit 4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, the statement of account is <span style="">an </span>admission
by appellant that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> paid those amounts stated
therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, together with the
receipts of payments presented by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. M, N, O, P, Q, R, G, S, T, U, H, I, J, V, W, C, X, Y,
M, K and L), these form a basis for an analysis to determine whether <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was in default in the payment of <span style="">his </span>obligation when the vehicle was
seized on February <span style="">28, </span>1984.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The second issue must also be resolved in favor of <span style="">the respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Estavillo</span> proved
that on </span><st1:date year="1983" day="26" month="8"><span style="">August 26, 1983</span></st1:date><span style="">,
he paid P9,390.00 to FNCB through </span>its <span style="">employee, Jun <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>, who acknowledged </span>the
<span style="">payment in a private receipt to </span>be
<span style="">followed by the official receipt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> had
previously received similar installment payments from <span class="SpellE">Estavillo</span>
and appeared authorized to do so as evidenced by the subsequent official
receipts for such payments issued by the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner does not deny that <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> was its employee at the time the payment was
received by him and in fact was one of the persons who</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">seized
the vehicle from the private respondent's driver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It simply argues that <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>
was acting in an unofficial </span>capacity when he collected the payment,
which should therefore not be charged against it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is a pallid excuse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the payment was not delivered by <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>, FNCB should claim it from him and not <span class="SpellE">Estavillo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Estavillo's</span> payment to <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>, <span style="">as </span>the authorized collector of FNCB,
was a valid payment to FNCB.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finding from its computations that the private respondent had
paid the petitioner the total amount of P64,895.00, the lower courts ordered
the sum returned to him in lieu of the car, which could no longer be
restored.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner does not
question the refund itself but only the amount of the payments, contending that
it should not include the P15,340.00 directly <span style="">paid </span>by <span class="SpellE">Estavillo</span> to World Cars,
Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not see why this sum should
be excluded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was part of the
consideration he paid for the car, which <span style="">he
can no longer recover.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>That would
represent part of the damages he s<span style="">u</span>stained
as <span style="">a </span>result of the illegal act
of the petitioner in depriving him of the vehicle despite his legal <span style="">right </span>to it.</p>

<p class="BODY">The down payment could be an issue between World Cars, Inc. and
FNCB, but it should not affect <span class="SpellE">Estavillo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As far <span style="">as
</span><span style="">he </span>is concerned, he is
entitled to full reimbursement of the amount he has paid for the Ford <span class="SpellE">Fiera</span> which the petitioner is unable to return to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner cannot claim <span class="SpellE">Estavillo</span> should recover the down <span style="">payment from </span>World Cars, Inc., because the latter had nothing to
do with the seizure and subsequent sale of the car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Estavillo's</span> cause
of action was against FNCB alone.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, the Court notes that the interest fixed for
the refund by the trial and respondent courts was only 10%.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This must be increased to 12%, in accordance
with <span class="SpellE">Reformina</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Tomol</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
where we held:</p>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> the Monetary Board increased the rate of legal interest from that of
six (6%) percent per annum originally allowed under Section 1 of Act No. 2655
to twelve (12%) percent per annum.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>It will be noted that Act No. 2655 deals with interest on (1)
loans; (2) forbearances of any money, goods or credits; and (3) rate allowed in
judgments.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
x</blockquote>

<blockquote>The judgments spoken of and referred to are judgments in
litigations involving loans or forbearance of any money, goods or credits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any other kind of monetary judgment which has
nothing to do with, nor involving loans or forbearance of any money, goods or
credits does not fall within the coverage of the said law for it is not within
the ambit of the authority granted to the Central Bank.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Finally, we find <span style="">the</span>
award of nominal and exemplary damages justified under the following provisions
of the Civil Code:</p>

<blockquote>Art. 2221.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nominal damages
are adjudicated in order that a right of the plaintiff, which has been violated
or invaded by the defendant, may be vindicated or recognized, and not for the
purpose of indemnifying the plaintiff for any loss suffered by him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Art. 2232.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In contracts and
quasi-contracts, the court may award exemplary damages if the defendant acted
in a wanton, fraudulent, reckless, oppressive or malevolent manner.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner was less than fair in its treatment of the private
respondent, who suffered not only actual damages but also humiliation and
mental anguish over the unwarranted confiscation of the vehicle he cherished
and for which he had already made substantial payments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The seizure <span style="">was </span>clearly reckless and without
regard for his feelings and reputation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On top of this, the petitioner deliberately submitted a false statement
of accounts which, when closely analyzed by the trial court, was found to have
omitted <span style="">a </span>number of payments for
which <span class="SpellE">Estavillo</span> produced the corresponding
receipts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is clear that <span class="SpellE">Estavillo</span> is entitled to redress in the form of nominal and
exemplary damages, in addition to the refund of the payments made by him, for
all these thoughtless if not malicious acts of the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the challenged decision is AFFIRMED except for
the modification of the imposed interest, which <span style="">is </span>increased to 12%.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Costs against the petitioner.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
