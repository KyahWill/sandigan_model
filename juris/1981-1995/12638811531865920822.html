before the Regional Trial Court, 5th Judicial Region, Branch 12, Ligao,

1986, at Barangay Herrera, Municipality of Ligao, Province of Albay,
Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Coort (sic), the above-named
accused, together with two (2) other undindentified (sic) persons, all of them

<blockquote>"ACTS CONTRARY TO LAW,"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Only Salvador Sadia, Jr. and Mario Opeña
alias "Ka Elmo" were apprehended whereas Jose Allorde y Penoblar
remains at large.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, trial on
the merits proceeded against Sadia, Jr. and Opeña.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1990" day="31" month="1">January
 31, 1990</st1:date>, the trial court rendered its decision, the dispositive
portion of which, reads (pp. 27-27-A, <u>Rollo</u>):</p>

<blockquote>"SO ORDERED."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Hence, the present appeal by Salvador
Sadia, Jr.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts, as stated in the plaintiff­-appellee's
brief are, as follows (pp. 88-93, <u><span style="">Rollo</span></u><span style="">):<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"At around <st1:time minute="30" hour="11">11:30 a.m.</st1:time>
on <st1:date year="1986" day="18" month="11">November 18, 1986</st1:date>,
Danilo Chavez, a farmer, was working on the farm of Jose Lopez at Barangay
Herera (sic), Ligao, Albay (p. 7, tsn, Oct. 26, 1989).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Chavez arrived at the landholding of Jose
Lopez at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the
morning of <st1:date year="1986" day="18" month="11">November 18, 1986</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He came along with Lopez himself and they
rode (on) the motorcycle of Lopez.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nobody was still (sic) around at that time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then they proceeded to the farm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about <st1:time minute="30" hour="8">8:30<span style=""> </span>a.m.</st1:time>, people began to
arrive (pp. 8-9, tsn, <st1:state><st1:place>Id.</st1:place></st1:state>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Among those who arrived at the farm were appellant, Jose
Allorde and Mario Opeña @ Ka Elmo (pp. 9-10, tsn, <st1:state><st1:place>Id.</st1:place></st1:state>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time these persons arrived, Lopez was
in his fishpond with Chavez cleaning it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The three persons, appellant, Allorde and Opeña, were to clean the
fishpond of Allorde (pp. 10-11, tsn, <st1:state><st1:place>Id.</st1:place></st1:state>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fishpond of Lopez and Allorde were about
20 meters apart (p. 12, tsn, Id.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After Lopez had brought Chavez to the fishpond, he told
Chavez that he would go back to Guinobatan (p. 12, <span style="">tsn, Id.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>However, at
around 11:30 of the day, Lopez came back to the fishpond while Chavez was
cooking his lunch at the side of the fishpond (p. 13, tsn, Id.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Suddenly, Chavez heard gunshots and when Chavez turned to
look where the shots came from, he saw Ka Elmo, Allorde, appellant and two
others (whom) he failed to identify.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
group was about 20 meters away from Chavez (p. 13, tsn, Id.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Chavez saw the group fire at Lopez whose two
arms were raised and he was asking the group to stop shooting and for them to
talk over whatever wrong doings (sic) he may have committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lopez was about 15 meters away from where the
group was shooting at him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Opeña used a
long barrel gun and even fell <span style="">into </span>the
fishpond while he was firing at Lopez (p. 14, tsn, Id.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Chavez could not tell what kind of gun the
others were using.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Chavez was not able
to notice if appellant was holding a gun because what he saw was that the five
of them were in a group <span style="">(p. </span>15,
tsn, Id.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, while the group was
firing at Lopez, he was looking at Lopez (p. 51, tsn, Id.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the firing, Lopez ran towards the
irrigation shouting at Chavez to take care of himself (p. 15, tsn, Id.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lopez fell face down on the irrigation by the
roadside and Ka Elmo and another <span style="">in </span>the
group fired two more shots at him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then
they went near Lopez, kicked him and shot him at the right temple.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that time, Chavez was about 10 meters away
and was running away to report the incident to the Barangay Captain of Herera
(sic).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant and Allorde then rode
(on) a tricycle and fled while Ka Elmo and the 2 others took the motorcycle of
Lopez <span style="">(pp. </span>16-17, tsn, Id.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After this incident, Chavez did not work
anymore at the landholding of Lopez because he learned that he was being hunted
by the group who shot Lopez to death (p. 19, tsn, Id.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The body of Lopez was autopsied in <span style="">the </span>evening of November 18, 1986 at Nuestra <span style="">Sra. </span>de Salvacion Funeral Parlor at
Guinobatan, Albay by Dr. Domingo Vergara, Jr., Chief, Rapu-Rapu District
Hospital <span style="">(p. </span>10, tsn, Oct. 25,
1989).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following wounds were found on
the body of Lopez:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1)<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Through and through gunshot wound, head area, entrance-right ear with
pinnal laceration:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>exit ear</blockquote>

could cause immediate death</blockquote>

<blockquote>2)<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Gunshot wound, entrance at the right infra-scapular area (right side at <span style="">the </span>back, the bone area at the back of
the body</blockquote>

<blockquote>3)<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Gunshot wound, entrance at the right costo-vertebral angle (right side
of the body near the angle of the rib case)</blockquote>

<blockquote>- fatal area because the liver sustained
lacerations that caused bleeding</blockquote>

</span>Gunshot wound, entrance at the right buttocks, lateral side (right hip
fleshly area)</blockquote>

<blockquote>6)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gunshot
wound, exit at the parasternal area, left side, level of the first ICS)</blockquote>

<blockquote>7)<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Gunshot wound, exit at the medial side of the left thigh, middle 3rd
(pp. 11-12, 17-21, tsn, Oct. 25, 1989)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The cause of death was:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>hypovolenic shock secondary to multiple gunshot wounds, fatal (p. 21,
tsn, Id.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the early morning of the day when Lopez was shot, a
conference was called by one Ka Daniel of the CPP-NPA Pasabilis Section at
Sitio Baruc-barucan Barangay Herera (sic), Ligao, Albay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that conference, a decision was reached
that somebody was going to be killed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Among the 8 or 9 persons present at the said conference, were Mansueto
Lucio, Benjamin Sta. Maria, Ka Elmo and appellant, alias Ka Jun Sadia.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was agreed that it was already time to
'deliver' <span style="">Lopez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Assigned to kill Lopez were six
members with appellant and Ka <span style="">Elmo </span>a<span style="">s </span>triggermen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason given for killing Lopez was
because he was against the CPP-NPA organization meaning that he did not give
"taxes" to the NPA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ka Elmo
carried a carbine while Ka Jun had a .45 caliber.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The group parted at around 7:00 a.m.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At past 1<span style="">1</span><span style="">:00</span><span style=""> </span>o'clock of the same day, Lopez was
killed (pp. 4, 9-10, 12, 14, 16-21, tsn, Dec. 12, 1989; pp. 7-8, tsn, Dec. 13,
1989).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At the time of his death, Lopez had a rice farm and fishpond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every three months he harvested more than
1,000 tilapia from his fishpond (p. 21, tsn, Dec. 13, 1989).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After his death, his family could not attend
anymore to their fishpond at Herera (sic).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Lopez was also engaged in buying and selling palay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He left three children with ages 10, 5 and
1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For funeral expenses, his wife spent
P15,000.00 (p. <span style="">22, </span>tsn,
Id.)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, the accused-appellant raises the following
assignment of errors:</p>

<p class="NUM">1. the trial court erred in finding him guilty of murder on the
basis of the testimonies of alleged co-conspirators, prosecution witnesses
Mansueto Lucio and Benjamin Sta. Maria; and</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the trial court erred in
appreciating band as an aggravating circumstance and in imposing the penalty of
<u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u> against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellant asseverates that the trial court
disregarded material inconsistencies in the testimonies of Lucio, Sta. Maria
and Chavez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lucio and Sta. Maria, in
their respective testimonies at the hearing on December 12, 1989 and December
13, 1989, claimed that at a conference called by a certain Ka Daniel among the
operatives <span style="">of </span>the New People's
Army in the area, the accused-appellant and <span style="">Opeña </span>were given the assignment of liquidating Lopez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, at the hearing held on October 26,
1989.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Chavez testified that, of the five
(5) men he saw in the vicinity during the shooting -- the accused-appellant,
Opeña, Allorde and two (2) John Does, he saw only Opeña and the two (2) John
Does shoot Lopez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, Chavez did
not even notice whether or not the accused-appellant and Allorde had a
gun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, even Chavez' positive
identification of the accused-appellant as among those he saw with the group
who shot Lopez is rebutted by the testimony of Reynaldo Maristela, a barangay
tanod, that after the shooting, when <span style="">he </span>asked
Chavez who shot Lopez, Chavez replied that "he does not know."</p>

<p class="BODY">The alleged inconsistencies do not exist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although Chavez saw only Opeña and the two
(2) John Does shoot Lopez and he failed to notice whether or not the accused-appellant,
in particular, held a gun (p. 51, tsn, October 26, 1989), his
(accused-appellant) presence at the scene of the crime during the <span style="">time </span>Lopez was killed was sufficiently
proven.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Chavez testified that (pp.
12-13, <u>ibid</u>):</p>

<blockquote>"x x x.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then,
what transpired when (sic) Jose Lopez was working in his fishpond?<i style=""><o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
that time when Mr. Lopez brought me to the fishpond to work, Mr. Lopez told me
that he will just take me to Herera (sic) and he will go back to Guinobatan,
but at around 11:30 Mr. Lopez (sic) arrived and I was and even cooking already
for the midday meal and then I heard the (sic) gunshot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These five people were there when Mr. Lopez
was shot.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x x x.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
you heard (a) gunshot, what did you do?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
I heard the (sic) gunshot I turned my face and looked at these five, this Ka
Elmo, Allorde, Sadia and the other two whom I was not able to identify.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x x x." </blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Chavez could not have been mistaken in
identifying the accused-appellant because he has known him even prior to the
shooting incident (p. 11, <u>ibid</u>):</p>

<blockquote>"x x <span style="">x<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How
about this Salvador Sadia, Jr., do you know (sic) him before November 18, 1986?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Yes, sir, because he has a sari-sari
store in Herera (sic) and I used to buy cigarette and viand when(ever) I work
there in Herera <span style="">(sic).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"x x x."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">It bears emphasis that the trial court <span style="">found </span><span style="">the</span> accused-appellant guilty of the crime charged, on the basis
of conspiracy (pp. 26-27, <u><span style="">Rollo</span></u><span style="">):</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In the case at bar, the court is of the honest opinion that
conspiracy was duly established.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was
direct proof of the existence of conspiracy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was that conference at Burucburucan in the mroning (sic) of
November 18, 1986, between the hours of 6:00 and 7:00, where the killing of
Jose Lopez was agreed upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused
Ka Elmo and Salvador Sadia, Jr. were present and were among those ordered <span style="">to </span>kill Lopez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When conspiracy is established, the act of
one is the act of all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In order to hold
an accused guilty as co-principal by reason of conspiracy, it must be
established that he perform (sic) an overt act in furtherance of the
conspiracy, either by actively participating in the actual commission of the
crime or by biding (sic) moral assistance to his co-conspirators by being
present at the scene of the crime (Pp. vs. Peralta, 25 SCRA 759).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused Sadia may not have fired a shot as it
was not shown that he was holding a gun.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was however present during the killing."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">The
positive </span>identification of the accused-appellant by Chavez as among those
who shot Lopez was not rebutted by the testimony of Maristela that when he
asked Chavez who shot Lopez, Chavez replied that "he does not know."
Chavez was then afraid to reveal the identity of the killers of Lopez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the incident, he stopped working in the
landholding of Lopez because he was being hunted by the persons who killed
Lopez (p. 19, tsn, October 26, 1989).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And, as stated by the trial court, the information was prepared only in
1988 and filed in January, 1989, because aside from the fact that the culprits
were still at large, Chavez entertained fear that he might be liquidated by the
killers of Lopez should he testify (p. 22, <u><span style="">Rollo</span></u><span style="">).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Additionally, the accused-appellant alleges that the trial court
erred in considering the aggravating circumstance of band.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As testified to by Chavez, only three (3) of
Lopez’ killers were armed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Article
14, No. 6, paragraph 2 of the Revised Penal Code, the indispensable elements of
band are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1) there must be at least four
(4) malefactors; and 2) all of the four (4) malefactors must be armed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, even if it were proven that the
accused-appellant is guilty of the crime charged, since the aggravating
circumstance of band cannot be appreciated against the accused, the penalty
imposable is only eighteen (18) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day to
twenty (20) years of <u><span style="">reclusion</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>temporal</u>, and not <u>reclusion</u>
<u>perpetua</u>, as decreed by the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the allegation that the trial court erred in appreciating the
aggravating circumstance of band in this case, We agree with the
accused-appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence of the
prosecution showed that among the five (5) members of the group who killed <span style="">Lopez, </span>only three (3) were armed (pp.
31, 50, tsn, October 26, 1989).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article
14(6), paragraph 2 of the Revised Penal Code is explicit that "[w]henever <u>more</u>
<u>than</u> <u><span style="">three</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>armed</u> <u><span style="">malefactors</span></u><span style=""> </span>shall have acted together in the commission of an offense, it
shall be deemed to have been committed by a band" (underscoring
supplied).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We regret, however, that
while We sustain this allegation of the accused-appellant, it will not help in
reducing the penalty to be imposed on him, as We shall discuss later.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have thus limited Our disquisition on the aforementioned
issues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other issue in this appeal,
namely, whether the prosecution established that the killing of Lopez <span style="">was in </span>furtherance of rebellion or
murder, was never raised <span style="">in </span>the
proceedings before the trial court and cannot, therefore, be considered and
passed upon now (People v. Albior, et al., G.R. No. 75034, June 30, 1988, 163
SCRA 332; People v. Leoparte, G.R. No. 85328, July 4, 1990, 187 SCRA 190).</p>

<p class="BODY">Abuse of superior strength qualified the killing of Lopez to
murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This circumstance was proven by
the testimony of Chavez (pp. 14-16, tsn, October 26, 1989);</p>

<blockquote>"x x x.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x x x."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code provides that the crime of
murder is punishable by <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u> in its maximum <span style="">period </span>to death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as there are neither aggravating nor
mitigating circumstances that attended its commission in this case, the penalty
that should be imposed on the accused-appellant is the medium period of the
penalty prescribed by said article (Article 64 of the Revised Penal Code), or <u><span style="">reclusion</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>perpetua</u>, conformably with the doctrine adopted in
People v. Muñoz, et al., G.R. Nos. L-38969-70, <st1:date year="1989" day="9" month="2">February 9, 1989</st1:date>, 170 SCRA 107.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding Our previous finding that the
aggravating circumstance of band is not present in this case, the proper

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the decision appealed from is hereby
