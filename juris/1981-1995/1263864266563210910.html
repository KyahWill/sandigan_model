<p class="BODY">In the instant cases, the accused Emmanuel <span class="SpellE">Caganap</span>,
Rolando Reyes, <span class="SpellE">Gener</span> <span class="SpellE">Filoteo</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Melanio</span> Mendoza and <span class="SpellE">Renato</span>

that the appellant, Enrique <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, was their
companion in robbing the American Express Bank Branch in the U.S. Naval Base in
<span class="SpellE">Sangley</span> Point on <st1:date year="1971" day="4" month="6">4 June 1971</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Rolando Reyes and <span class="SpellE">Gener</span> <span class="SpellE">Filoteo</span>
also stated that the appellant was one of those who acted as
"look-outs" outside the base and waited for them outside the hole
they had previously made in the wire fence to facilitate their exit from the
naval base.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Melanio</span>
Mendoza and <span class="SpellE">Gener</span> <span class="SpellE">Filoteo</span>
further stated that they saw the appellant inside the Bay Court Hotel talking
to Ruben Martinez.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These extra-judicial
confessions were given when the presumption of law was in favor of spontaneity
and <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span> of a confession and it was
incumbent upon the accused to destroy that presumption;<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
and yet, no evidence had been presented to overcome that presumption except the
retracting testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Gener</span> <span class="SpellE">Filoteo</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Melanio</span> Mendoza, and <span class="SpellE">Renato</span>
Mendoza to the effect that they did not give the <span class="SpellE">implicatory</span>
statements.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the accused
Emmanuel <span class="SpellE">Caganap</span> and Rolando Reyes, who both pleaded
guilty, did not recant their statements.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Besides, the recitals therein reflect spontaneity and coherence and are replete
with details that only the confessants could have known and supplied.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant claims, however, that the said extra-judicial
confessions of his co-accused should not be taken against him following the
rule of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alios</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>acta</u></span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The cited rule is not absolute.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the case of <u>People v. <span class="SpellE">Ty</span> <span class="SpellE">Sui</span> Wong</u>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"Since <u>People vs. <span class="SpellE">Badilla</span></u>,
the rule which has been reiterated by this Court in various cases is that
extrajudicial confessions, independently made without collusion, which are
identical with each other in their essential details and are corroborated by
other evidence on record, are admissible as circumstantial evidence against the
person implicated to show the probability of the latter's actual participation
in the commission of the crime.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Inasmuch as there is no proof of collusion among the <span class="SpellE">declarants</span>, their confessions should, therefore, be read
together to form a complete picture of the commission of the crime and
considered collectively as corroborative or confirmatory of the evidence apart
from the confessions themselves."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is no evidence of collusion and the extra-judicial
confessions of appellant's co-accused are corroborated by Marilyn <span class="SpellE">Tordecillas</span> <span class="SpellE">Orendain</span>, wife of the
Assistant Manager of the Bay Court Hotel, who declared that she saw the
appellant, Enrique <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, at a little past 6:00
o'clock in the morning of 4 June 1971 in the Bay Court Hotel together with the
accused Roberto Martinez and five (5) armed men who rode in a jeep and escorted
the Goody-Goody truck to the hotel premises and left the hotel together at
about 9:00 o’clock that morning.</p>

<p class="BODY">Conspiracy can also be inferred from the fact that after the
commission of the robbery in the U.S. naval base, the accused-<span class="SpellE">appeIIant</span> and his co-accused, Manuel Mateo, Jr. and Roberto
Martinez, fled together to the house of Fiscal Dante <span class="SpellE">Filoteo</span>,
where they "holed out" until they were persuaded to surrender to the
authorities in the early morning of 5 June 1971.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, the alibi of the appellant is not convincing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His claim that he was in his house at about
the time the robbery was perpetrated in <span class="SpellE">Sangley</span>
Point, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
looking over the spare parts which were delivered to him by one <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> Medina, appears to be an afterthought.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No record of the alleged transaction was
presented in court and the jeep he was supposed to assemble for one Danny <span class="SpellE">Abarro</span> could not be traced.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He reasoned that <span class="SpellE">Abarro</span>, who is now living
abroad, had allegedly sold the jeep to one Penny <span class="SpellE">Lalana</span>
who is now deceased.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant's claim that he went to the house of the chief of
police to seek protection after having been told by the desk sergeant that
there was a shoot-to-kill order out for him and that he then transferred to the
house of Fiscal Dante <span class="SpellE">Filoteo</span> in order to get the <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span> help in surrendering to the police authorities, is
incredible.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To begin with, the desk
sergeant, one Salazar, who is now conve­niently deceased, could not have told
the appellant at 11:00 o'clock in the morning of 4 June 1971 of an alleged
shoot-to­-kill order as a result of the robbery in <span class="SpellE">Sangley</span>
Point, because his co-accused Emmanuel <span class="SpellE">Caganap</span>, who
implicated the appellant in the bank robbery, was investigated only at about
1:35 o'clock in the afternoon of 4 June 1971.</p>

<p class="BODY">And, if his purpose in going to the house of Fiscal Dante <span class="SpellE">Filoteo</span> was to seek the latter's help in order to
surrender, why did he not surrender to Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Filoteo</span>
earlier when they met at the house of the chief of police?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Again, there was no point in going to Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Filoteo</span> in order to surrender when he was already at the
police station and all he had to do was to give up to the desk sergeant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is unfortunate that the said desk sergeant
is already dead and cannot answer the appellant's charge that he was remiss in
the performance of his duty to arrest the <span class="SpellE">appeIIant</span>,
pursuant to the shoot-to-kill order.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the Court has held in a great number of cases that for
alibi to prosper, it is not enough to prove that the accused was somewhere else
when the crime was committed, but it must be also shown that it was physically
impossible for him to have been at the scene of the crime at the time of its
commission.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant was in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
when the robbery was committed and his then proximity to the scene of the crime
does not rule out the possibility that he could be at the scene of the crime at
the time it was committed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the
trial court found that the “flimsiness of the defense of alibi is exposed by
the nearness of the accused to the scene of the crime.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court found the appellant guilty of the crime of
Robbery in Band with Homicide.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is
not correct.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case of <u>People
vs. <span class="SpellE">Pedroso</span></u>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
There is no special complex crime of robbery in band with double homicide
and/or serious, less serious or slight physical injuries under the present
Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 373.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>If robbery with homicide (or with the other crimes enumerated above) is
committed by a band, the indictable offence would still be denomi­nated as
‘robbery with homicide’ under Article 294(1), but the circumstance that it was
committed by a band is not an element of the crime but is merely a generic
aggravating circumstance which may be offset by mitigating circumstances.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The homicides or murders and physical
injuries, <u>irrespective of their numbers</u>, committed on the occasion or by
reason of the robbery are merged in the composite crime of ‘robbery with
homicide.’ x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"
(Emphasis Supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, the appellant should be found guilty of the crime of
"Robbery with Homicide." The penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> imposed by the trial court is correct.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But, the amount to be paid to the heirs of
the slain marine officer should be increased to P30<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
in line with the recent decisions of the Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">We also find that the penalty imposed upon the appellant, Enrique
<span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, in <span class="SpellE">Crim</span>. Cases
Nos. CCC-VII­-844, CCC-VII-845, and CCC-VII-846-Cavite City, is not in accord
with law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The penalty provided for the
offense under Article 294, No. 5, of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, is <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">correccional</span></u>
in its maximum period to <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span><u> mayor</u>
in its medium period, or from four (4) years, two (2) months and one (1) day to
ten (10) years.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Applying the
Indeterminate Sentence Law, the minimum period to be imposed should be within
the range of the penalty next lower in degree, which is <span class="SpellE"><u>arresto</u></span><u>
mayor</u> in its maximum period to <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">correccional</span></u> in its medium period, or from four (4)
months and one (1) day to four (4) years and two (2) months.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The minimum of the period imposed by the
trial court, which is four (4) years, two (2) months and <u>one</u> <u>(1)</u> <u>day</u>,
is obviously beyond the period provided for by law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It should be reduced accordingly.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the maximum period, there being two (2)
aggravating circumstances and no mitigating circumstance, the maximum of the
period, which is ten (10) years, should be imposed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The correct penalty to be imposed upon the
appellant, Enrique <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, in each of the three
(3) aforementioned cases (CCC-VII-844, CCC-VII-845, CCC-VII-846-Cavite City)
should, therefore, be imprisonment of from four (4) years and two (2) months,
as minimum, to ten (10) years, as maximum.</p>
