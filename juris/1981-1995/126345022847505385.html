				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">By this petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>, the Director of
Lands <span style="">seeks </span>to set aside the decision
of the Court of Appeals in C.A.-G.R. No. 59853-R affirming the decision of the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> in LRC Case No.
N-893 granting the application for registration under R.A. 496 of thirteen (13)
parcels of land in the name of herein private respondent Manuela Pastor.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that on <st1:date year="1974" day="8" month="5">May 8,
 1974</st1:date>, respondent Manuela Pastor filed with the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> LRC Case No. N-893, an
application for confirmation of imperfect title over thirteen (13) lots
situated in <span class="SpellE">Gulod</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pallocan</span>,
<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Batangas</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The application shows that seven (7) of the lots, specifically
Lots Nos. 9186-A, 9186-B, 9186-D, 9330-A, 9330-C, 9402-A and 9402-D were
allegedly inherited by respondent Manuela Pastor from her parents Rafael Pastor
and <span class="SpellE">Natalia</span> <span class="SpellE">Quinio</span> who died
on July 1, 1938 and July 12, 1908, respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other six (6) lots, namely Lots Nos.
9402-B, 9402-E, 9397-B, 9397-D, 9367 and 9360 were allegedly inherited by
respondent from her aunt Rosario Pastor who died on <st1:date year="1950" day="13" month="1">January 13, 1950</st1:date> without any surviving heir
except respondent herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In her
application, the respondent claims that she and her predecessors-in-interest
had been in continuous, uninterrupted, open, public, adverse and notorious
possession of the lots under claim of ownership for more than thirty (30)
years.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1974" day="24" month="6">June 24, 1974</st1:date>
the application was amended to correct the description of two lots.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Director of Lands filed an opposition to the application on
the ground that applicant Manuela Pastor and her predecessors-in-interest
neither had title in fee simple nor imperfect title under Section 48 of the
Public Land Law, as amended, over the lots in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">No other persons filed opposition to the application.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>,
acting as a land registration court, issued an order of general default with
the exception of the Director of Lands, and then proceeded to hear the
applicant, her witnesses, and <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> Director of
Lands.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the hearings, the applicant presented as her witnesses her
nephew Antonio M. Pastor, and Geodetic Engineer <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span>
P. <span class="SpellE">Clemeneo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Applicant Manuela Pastor testified on her behalf that she has remained
the owner and possessor of the lots in question; that her possession has been
peaceful, public, open, continuous, adverse against the whole world and in the
concept of owner; that she had paid the taxes thereon; and that the said lots
were planted to sugar cane.</p>

<p class="BODY">Witness Antonio M. Pastor corroborated in all material respects
the testimony of his aunt Manuela Pastor.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The </span>Geodetic
Engineer, <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Clemeneo</span>,
testified that he conducted the survey of some of the lots and verified the
survey conducted by the Bureau of Lands on the others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He found that the lots did not encroach upon
private and public lands.</p>

<p class="BODY">As part of her documentary evidence, applicant Manuela Pastor
presented the certifications of the Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>
City showing payments of the real estate tax on the lots from 1965 to 1974
(Exhibits J, J-1, J-2, J-3, J-4 and J-5) and official receipts of payments of
real estate tax on the same lots for 1975 (Exhibits K, K-1 and K-2).</p>

<p class="BODY">Apart from the foregoing, applicant presented, however, a
certification from the Land Registration Commission (Exhibit L) stating that

 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Batangas</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,

originally owned by the applicant's aunt, <span class="SpellE">Dra</span>.
Rosario Pastor; that the latter possessed the said lots peacefully, openly,

Rosario Pastor on <st1:date year="1950" day="13" month="1">January 13, 1950</st1:date>,

<p class="BODY">Substantially, the same issues, as raised by petitioner <span style="">in the Court of Appeals, are brought before
US.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner asserts </span>that
the decision <span style="">rendered in Cadastral Case
No. 41 (Exhibit L) declaring Lot No. 9330 -- from which Lots Nos. 9330-A and
9330-C were derived -- constitutes <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>adjudicata</u></span> as to the nature of the lots in question
and therefore, a bar to <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> application.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Additionally, petitioner also argued that:</p>

<blockquote>"Lots Nos. 9186-A, 9186-B and 9186-D of the Cadastral Survey
of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, were derived from <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>

Lot No. 9397.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As shown by applicant's Exhibit L-1, Lots Nos. 9186, 9360,
9367, 9397 and 9402 were the subject of a decision <span style="">rendered </span>in Cad. <span class="GramE">Case No. 43, LRC Cad.</span> <span class="GramE">Record No. 1712, although no decree of registration has as yet been

under Act No. 496 (Lopez v. Director of Lands, 48 Phil. 589; Section 1.
paragraph (f), Rule 16, Rules of Court).</blockquote>

proceeding for land registration case under Act No, 496.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Either way, whether the decision of the cadastral court in
Cad. Case No. 43 had became final or not, the present proceeding for land
registration under Act No. 496 cannot prosper because of the principles of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>adjudicata</u></span> and <span class="SpellE"><u>litis</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>pendentia</u></span>"
<span style="">(pp. </span>15-16, rec.).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">WE find no legal basis to
uphold the foregoing contentions of petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is clear from the evidence on record that in the proceedings had
before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>,
acting as a land registration court, the <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span>
Director of Lands, petitioner herein, did not interpose any objection nor set
up the defense of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>adjudicata</u></span>
with respect to the lots in question.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such failure on the part of <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> Director
of Lands, to OUR mind, is a procedural infirmity which cannot be cured on
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 2, Rule 9, Revised Rules
of Court of 1964, in no uncertain language, provides that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 2.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defenses and objections not pleaded deemed
waived. -- Defenses and objections not pleaded either in a motion to dismiss or
in the answer are deemed waived; x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">x</span></span><span class="GramE"> ."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">All defenses therefore
not interposed in a motion to dismiss or in an answer are deemed waived
(Santiago, et al. vs. Ramirez, et al., L-15237, May 31, 1963, 8 SCRA 157, 162; <span class="SpellE">Torreda</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Boncaros</span>, L-39832,
January 30, 1976, 69 SCRA 247, 253).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Thus, the defense of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>adjudicata</u></span> when
not set up either in a notion to dismiss or in an answer, is deemed </span><span style="">waived.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span><span style="">It </span>cannot be
pleaded for the first time at the trial or on appeal (Phil. Coal Miner's Union
vs. CEPOC, et al., L-19007, April 30, 1964, 10 SCRA 784, 789).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">But granting for a
moment, that the defenses of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>adjudicata</u></span> was properly raised by petitioner herein,
WE still hold that, factually, there is no prior final judgment at all to speak
of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision in Cadastral Case No.
41 does not constitute a bar to the application of respondent Manuela Pastor;
because a decision in a cadastral proceeding declaring a lot public land is not
the final decree contemplated in Sections 38 and 40 of the Land Registration
Act.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A </span><span style="">judicial declaration that a parcel of land is
public, </span>does not preclude even <span style="">the
same </span>applicant from subsequently seeking a judicial confirmation of his
title to the same land, provided he thereafter complies with the provisions of
Section 48 of Commonwealth Act No. 141, as amended, and as long as said public
land remains alienable and disposable <span style="">(now
</span>sections 3 and 4, P.D. No. 1073).</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to Cadastral Case No. 43, the evidence on record is
too scanty to sustain the view of the petitioner that the decision rendered
therein constitutes <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">adjudicata</span></u></span><span style="">, </span>or in the absence of finality
thereof, <span class="SpellE"><u>litis</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">pendentia</span></u></span><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>On
the contrary, private respondent has amply shown that no final decree
whatsoever was issued in connection with said cadastral <span class="GramE">case,</span>
even <span style="">as </span>it is not known in whose
favor said decision was rendered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
found by the Court of Appeals:</p>

<blockquote>"Again, we sustain the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is an ambiguity as to what was
adjudicated in Case No. 43.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the lots
in question were in that case awarded to a third party, the latter should have
intervened in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But no private
party has challenged the application for registration" <span style="">(p. </span>30, rec.).</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, petitioner argues for the first time on appeal that
"there is no substantial evidence to show that she (private respondent <span style="">Manuela </span>Pastor) and her
predecessors-in-interest have been in possession of the lots sought to be
titled for a period of at least thirty (30) years and in the manner provided in
Section 48, as amended, of the Public Land Law."</p>

<p class="BODY">We find no merit in the foregoing argument of petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span>
testimony of private respondent Manuela Pastor, which was further corroborated
by the testimony of Antonio Pastor, conclusively established beyond doubt that
the respondent, together with her predecessors-in-interest since the year 1913
and <span style="">up </span>to the present, had been
in open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation of the
lots in question under a <u>bona</u> <u>fide</u> claim of ownership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the documentary evidence submitted
by private respondent also show that the lots have been declared for taxation
purposes in the name of respondent Manuela Pastor (Exhibit 'I'), and the taxes
thereon have been paid by said respondent herein (Exhibits 'J', 'J-1' to 'J-5',
'K', 'K-1' and 'K-2').<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And finally,
Geodetic Engineer <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> <span class="SpellE">Clemeneo</span>,
who conducted the survey of some of the lots and verified the survey conducted <span style="">by the </span><span style="">Bureau </span>of Lands, testified that the thirteen (13) lots in
question did not encroach upon public or private lands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All these are unmistakable indicia that
respondent Manuela Pastor has performed and complied with all <span style="">the conditions essential to entitle her to a
confirmation </span>or <span style="">her imperfect
title over the thirteen (13) lots subject of her </span>application.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> THE DECISION OF THE COURT OF APPEALS IS
AFFIRMED, AND THE PETITION IS HEREBY DISMISSED.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>NO COSTS.</p>
